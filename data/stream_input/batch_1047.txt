B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a tough DVD, but I love the strength it builds.  Love the challenge.   Have to admit some days I'd rather not use it, but I have gained much from using it.
B001HN694K|1.0|This movie was a huge disappointment, and I have to agree with many criticisms raised by other people who gave it one star. Now, I have no quarrels with film directors who want to modify their literary source to fit the demands of the cinematographic media and make the best use of the media. I think it's the only way to create a strong original movie as opposed to a series of video illustrations to the book. However, I have a problem with the fact that the movie has none of the originality, depth, absurdity and paradoxical nature of the books. Instead, it has a pre-digested Hollywood formula complete with a happy ending, a standard set of visual and verbal cliches and is flat and predictable at every step. Anyone could have written the screenplay after watching 3-4 Disney movies and substituting the characters for those from the \\"Alice\\" books. The visuals appears to be borrowed from a bunch of Disney's haunted house movies and sometimes - from \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" but without the breathtaking originality and the panoramic scale of the latter. The music is even worse and seems to be coming from the same third-rate ghost movies. I have heard that the last song is good, but cannot comment on it; I could not believe my luck when the movie has ended and turned it off as soon as the titles began.    Against this pathetic backdrop, some things in the movie that could have been otherwise disturbing (such as a mockery of physical deformities in people) did not really matter. This movie is not going to have any kind of lasting impact on minds and souls.
0307463745|5.0|I found the first few chapters, \\"Takedown\\" and \\"Go\\" which are focused on entrepreneurialism and startups, to be less interesting.  But the last 2/3 of the book is the type of crystal-clear, simply-stated, pure truth that you've come to expect from 37 Signals.  Rework is packaged full of unconventional thinking about how companies can take alternative approaches to hiring, competitive analysis, product development and corporate marketing.  If you are a CEO, Product Development or Marketing executive at small and midsize business, you should consider the ideas in Rework.<br /><br />My only criticism is that much of the content in the second half of the book was highly repetitive with the authors' earlier work \\"Getting Real.\\"  If you haven't read Getting Real (then you should), but the repetition will be less of an issue for you.  But even if you have read Getting Real I still would recommend Rework, because the ideas around productivity, competitors, hiring and culture are so powerful that they are worth reading twice (if not 100 times).<br /><br />Some of my favorite concepts (paraphrased) from the book are:<br /><br />Avoid getting suckered into a \\"one-upping, Cold War mentality\\" with competitors. You are not going to out-Apple Apple. You can't beat someone who's making the rules.  You need to redefine them.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer.  Being a good writer is about more than writing.  It is about clear thinking and communication.<br /><br />Marketing is not a department.  Every time you answer the phone, it's marketing.  Marketing isn't just a few individual events.  It is the sum of everything you do.<br /><br />Don't scar on the first cut.  If someone wears shorts to the office one day just tell them not to do it again.  Avoid the temptation to go create a policy around dress code.<br /><br />The book is almost 300 pages, but it is extremely quick to read.  So there are no excuses for not taking 2 hours to go through it.  Approximately 1/2 the pages in the book are blank or artwork so there is no reason to be intimidated.  The author's writing style makes reading purely enjoyable.  In fact, I turned off a movie on the plane to read this instead.  I read the hard copy, but I would recommend buying the digital download so you can take it with you anywhere you go.s in the book are blank or artwork so there is no reason to be intimidated.

0547258305|5.0|Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight--she's a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king's thug. When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change:<br /><br />She never expects to become Po's friend.<br /><br />She never expects to learn a new truth about her own Grace--or about a terrible secret that lies hidden far away.... A secret that could destroy all seven kingdoms with words alone.<br /><br />First off, I really enjoyed Graceling because it brought something fresh and new to the table. The concept of Graces was very interesting.  Graces are special powers that some people are born with, hence the term \\"Graceling\\". Gracelings can be identified by their eye color: the right and the left eye are two separate colors. Normally, Gracelings are not favored in society.<br /><br />{The whole eye color thing was one of my favorite parts, because I actually do have that. Just in case anyone is wondering, it's called heterochromia. I have partial heterochromia, which means that, while my eyes are brown, I actually have this massive glob of bright green in my left eye. Okay, back to the review.}<br /><br />Katsa was a new kind of heroine. I'm really not used to brusque and aloof females in fantasy as the main girls, and Katsa was very... tomboyish. It wasn't bad, just different. For instance, she's completely and one hundred percent opposed marriage, like, she never ever in her entire life wants to get married.  Even though she loves Po and wants to be with him, she refuses to marry him.<br /><br />Speaking of Po......... LOVE HIM! He was so well fleshed out, and I really appreciated the slow build to his and Katsa's relationship. They started out as friends, and then slowly blossomed into lovers. It was very nice, and led to some very romantic moments.<br /><br />The plot was great, although a little drawn out at the end. But it wasn't anything unmanageable. It was actually pretty suspenseful, and I found myself biting my nails sometimes as I read. Also, I really wasn't expecting what happened to Po, but I guessed it a little before it was revealed. Still, it added depth and reality. Life isn't all completely happy endings, and while this is fantasy, it certainly is not fairy tales.<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading about Katsa's friends, who were very well portrayed. I love side characters that actually mean something, and are not just there to fill space.<br /><br />Overall, this book was an amazing read and more than worth the price. A definite recommendation.<br /><br />Review from \\"What's Your Story?

0553805371|4.0|I was waiting for the book I pre-ordered and I just finished it. In the meantime, I read so many comments in newspapers and the media... now I can clearly see what I suspected: most of the critics simply ignored what the book was about. I was worried the book could not be as interesting as I was expecting but I must say it has been a very interesting reading. It makes you look for more (which I think is the real success of a good popular science piece). All the hype about God only increased my worries. personally, I don't think there is any need of looking for God for simpler reasons than M-theory, but the physics perspective and some of its implications are clearly pointing towards a new picture of cosmological thinking.    The book is far from trivial, and I enjoyed the efforts made by the authors in looking at the deep meaning of what is a model, what is reality and what should we expect from a theory to explain. This is, I think, really deep stuff that philosophy is not addressing too much. To say that philosophy is dead, as the authors claim in the first page might be too much, since there are good philosophers of science writing about the implications of mainstream science, but I agree it's rather an exception. In fact. many key problems that have been the matter of philosophical thinking are being truly addressed from scientists within science and in that sense M-theory as presented by these authors, as well as some very recommendable books, such as Vilenkin's one (\\"Many Worlds in one\\", 2006) on the possible explanation of spontaneous emergence of a universe from a vacuum is a great example.     Perhaps the book needs more expansion in the second half. Some things are presented too briefly, in mi opinion (that's why 4 stars). The reader could benefit from some more explanations on the nature and implications of the vacuum and in that sense I found more useful (nd complementary) Vilenkin's book. What is very clear to me, as it has been since it was first proposed by several theoretical physicists in the early 80's, the potential for a shift in our understanding and interpretation of the origins of the universe from quantum mechanics is simply tremendous and cannot be ignored. Our universe, which seems to be flat, is very likely to have a total ZERO energy, which means that there is \\"nothing\\" which looks like \\"Something\\". This is a completely new way of re-thinking the old question of \\"why there is something instead of nothing\\". A beautiful, appealing and truly profound view that cannot be ignored.     A very recommendable reading.
B000K1P66W|1.0|Having heard several people rave about this book, telling me that I absolutely HAD to read it, I was interested in what Ruiz has to say.  I cracked open the cover, read the inside flap (which, mind you, is the only part worth reading), and forged ahead to see what Toltec wisdom has to impart to this crazy western world.<br /><br />The first problem with this book is that Ruiz's writing itself is trash - conversational syntax, incomplete sentences, circular logic (if one can call anything in this book \\"logical\\"), and the most insipid examples/explanations of his various claims that I've ever read.  I don't have to have my socks blown off by a writer to appreciate his or her message; I can appreciate simple syntax, average diction, etc.. If the author can convey the point to me in a simple way, great. But this is a different kind of mediocrity.  If feels like I'm reading the journal of a 12-year-old who is butthurt about people gossiping about him. It makes it a drag to read. (More below on when Ruiz abandons mediocre writing for mystical contradictions and contrived excuses)<br /><br />So, says you, he can't write, but maybe he still has something worthwhile to say, right? Wrong. Ruiz nosedives on this account. As I said before, the inside flap lists the Four Agreements (Be impeccable with your word; Don't take anything personally; Don't make assumptions; and Always do your best), which taken at face value are commendable if not commonsense. But Ruiz severely damages the validity of these agreements by attempting to explain them.<br /><br />The majority of his examples meant to illustrate his points revolve around the meaningless situation of a complete stranger throwing you an off-handed comment on the street.  These are often superficial things like, \\"You're ugly,\\" \\"You're stupid,\\" and \\"We MUST be in junior high.\\" Any reasonable person over the age of 17 knows not to take something a complete stranger says to them seriously. Why Ruiz feels compelled to repeat such insipid examples for each of his agreements like they're going to be meaningful (or different?) after x repetitions is beyond me.<br /><br />He also describes the world as being in a state of hell, which may be accurate in some cases and I don't doubt for some people. But this bold claim immediately sets the setting in which all hope is lost, every single person is confused and malicious, and here's the kicker - we all LIKE it like this. We WANT to suffer. This again screams \\"I'm 12, I can't cope with life, I can't find good in the world, Everyone must be against me because I can't see the world for the navel-gazing I do. Poor me - and by extension, poor everyone! Everyone MUST feel the same!\\"<br /><br />Most of his advice for \\"making agreements\\" with oneself follows the general steps of:<br />1) If you make this agreement, happiness will rain from the sky (but only on you - everyone else around will still wallow in hell because they want to suffer).<br />2) To make this agreement, abandon anything that gets in the way of happiness.<br />3) Don't let yourself feel any natural or negative emotions: guilt, jealousy, hurt, anger. Just don't. No, I'm not going to expand on HOW to turn yourself into a hedonistic robot - how would I sell more books if I did?!<br />4) If you do experience guilt, pangs of responsibility, or second thoughts, purge them with singular focus for the sake of happiness.<br />5) When you've finally accepted this agreement, you will be logical (because stifling your conscience obviously makes you think logically) and happy, while everyone else is still in hell. Because that is truly a commendable goal. Yay.<br />Again, this is just empty. There isn't anything more to his advice than \\"Accept what I say and you (and only you) will be happy.\\"<br /><br />He explains how even if someone tells you \\"What you're doing/saying is hurting me,\\" it is not you who is hurting them.  It is they who have the internal wounds of which you remind them with your wordsor actions; you don't have to feel responsible for any hurt you cause another person because if they hurt, it is their fault and their problem.  Don't bog yourself down with the feelings of others, who, since they haven't flipped their Emotions-off, Robot-on switch, are inferior and deserve to suffer. Ruiz shamelessly exonerates his followers from any sort of commitment or mutual obligation to others in society. Thankfully, only a fraction of our fellows live according to such selfish and short-sighted guidelines.<br /><br />Finally, after he's had his field day with boring repetition of nothing, Ruiz decides it's high time to fill some of that empty space buzzing in your head with some good old-fashioned mystical rubbish that now flagrantly contradicts with what he said in the preceding paragraph(s). Sometimes, says he, you might hear voices in your head (which can either be called one's conscience or else clinically diagnosed). These \\"may be\\" the voices of other beings in alternate universes that are made of the same consciousness as our brains, what some people call \\"gods.\\" When they converse amongst themselves, their speech is on the same frequency as human brain waves, and we \\"may\\" hear their wills, their advice.  So we can't always be blamed for what we do, because it \\"may\\" be that we're acting (evidently quite helplessly, I might add) on impulse of a brain-god floating in another universe/time-space continuum.  This is a marvelously juicy addition to add to the rich repertoire we've already built of excuses for one's hedonism. When someone does something, it may be because 1) they're acting coldly in their self interest, or 2) they're acting out the will of a brain-god in an alternate reality and so can't be blamed. How splendidly unaccountable this makes us for - well, shoot, anything! Zero accountability and pursuing one's own happiness with furious abandon is the M.O. for which Ruiz cries.  Scary to think this is an adult, much less as one who's accredited with reasonable and helpful advice on how to live.<br /><br />I could go on with the flaws with this book, but I've already earned some tl;dr's as it is, and frankly, it doesn't matter.  This book is a tremendous disappointment.

B003EYVXYQ|3.0|It seems that our courageous leader Mr. Romero, for whom I have great respect and admiration for lest one think that I don't know the history of this series, has found a home in the not-too-scary zombie movie. Now, that's not to say that this one doesn't have the prerequisites of a horror movie. Fiends, blood, darkness and gore. But for this one, I'm not really sure what made them think that a slow moving plot and unrelenting lack of action would make for a good movie. More of an indie-type movie without quirky-ness or a love story. So, in essence, if one is to be A) Drunk B) Stoned C) Really old or D) Medicated, then this is a fast-paced romp between age-old enemies based upon feuds and thoughts about how the re-animated dead should be dealt with. For anyone who isn't one of the a fore mentioned requirements then it is a slow meandering riverboat ride with less-than-wallmart-halloween-scary zombies and a problem with actual violence. I wish for a movie that would bring the horror back into Mr. Romero's great concepts. I fear that he's got G. Lucas disease... where everyone he knows says \\"Oh That's Awesome!!\\" while the product suffers.
0440236738|5.0|This was my first read on Kindle and I have to paraphrase the fast turning pages to the fact that I kept hitting the advance page button because I was so eager to see \\"then what happened\\". This is my first Coben read but it will not be my last. His writing is splendid and the plot of Gone for Good is one of the best I've ever read. Every time I thought I had it figured out, (press page forward key), there was another twist, clever and astonishing. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to those who like well written, fast paced reading, well developed characters and plots. Bravo!!
B003YBNREI|4.0|This album is a well balanced of various types of music.  Is it  at the calibur of say Captain and Me  , I wouldn't go quite that far.  It does have some great tunes on it ,  Chatteau smacks of something that could have come off one of the first 3 Doobies releases , great tune and guitar.  This should be the next single released after Nobody. Nobody is a great refresh of the version off the first album. All in all a solid effort worth the money . I would say the only complaint is in this day and age a  cd that comes in at 47 minutes is a little short and could have had probably at least 3 or 4 more songs on it. I'm sure after 10 years they had 3 more in the wings they could have recorded...
0765326353|5.0|As others have said, this is an incredibly good and incredibly big book.  After 1000+ pages I still want more!<br /><br />Add me to the list of people disappointed by the low quality rendering of the art.  One of the characters in the book draws and has notes on her high quality sketches but they (and the maps) are rendered so badly even with the kindle book reader on the Mac or PC you will not be able to read her notes.  It is only about 20 pages of art so it is not a big deal but you may want to grab the hardback instead of the kindle version or be ready to head to the library if you want to see the details (including the notes written in the drawings and maps) or see the maps on the front and back inside covers which are not in the kindle version.

0198711913|5.0|Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.<br /><br />The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.<br /><br />And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.<br /><br />But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.<br /><br />For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.<br /><br />There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").<br /><br />And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.<br /><br />Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest.e page.

B003V4JU08|5.0|I originally didn't give NCIS: LA a chance, thinking it was just trying to cash in on my beloved NCIS (overly dramatic, aren't I), which I just discovered during the summer before the 7th season. However, when a commercial for an LA episode (Killshot) and it showed Abby, I decided to watch it just for an extra dose of Abby Sciuto (the goth woman). Abby was hardly in the episode (though she stole the show in what little time she had), but I didn't feel cheated. I loved the characters of LA and the story and I became hooked, rooting for Callen and his team along with Gibbs and his team. LA isn't as good as the original, but it's an awesome show with great stories and great characters. My favorite: The incomparable Hetty Lange.    Which is why I had to get this set, especially since NCIS: LA looked awesome on CBS HD. Let me tell you, this Blu-Ray trounces the HDTV showings. While the HDTV sometimes had blocking on fast action, there was none of that for the Blu. It did the near impossible and looked better than the strong HDTV showing. It also sounded great, though the audio in some scenes does sometimes seem a little lower than other scenes. All in all, great for the eyes and the ears.    I enjoyed the special features, despite them only being in standard definition. The info they provided about the show was really good and shows what the cast and crew are thinking, like how a set relates to a character, how they interact, and how they film for the OPS scenes. My only gripe is that they mention the original NCIS multiple times, but the closest to them showing original NCIS were clips of the original stars guest starring on LA. My favorite extras are 'Inside the Ops Center' and 'Lights...Cameras...ACTION'... Well, they will be, if and when season six of the original NCIS comes to Blu-Ray. The two parter episode of NCIS that served as the pilot for NCIS: LA (hence its inclusion, obviously). It looks and sounds as great as the actual LA episodes and makes me want NCIS toget its but on Blu-Ray now. My only complaint is that it might get people to not give the original NCIS a chance (I became a fan of NCIS' mother show JAG by renting the two discs the pilots were on and watching the non NCIS shows). Otherwise, I applaud CBS for not only including the two pilot episodes, but making them equal in quality to the other episodes. I also liked LL Cool J's music video despite not being a fan of rap. His song gave me the same impression I got when I heard Cote de Pablo sing as Ziva in a episode: Dude(ette, for Cote) can sing.    All in all, a great set for fans of NCIS: Los Angeles. However, if you prefer the original to LA, this set might be worth it, if only to convince CBS to have more Blu-ray releases of both NCIS series. If you do that, great for you and bless you if anymore NCIS comes because of that. However, I stand by NCIS: LA. It's a great show I would recommend to anyone who likes action shows, cop shows, and NCIS which looks great on Blu, all 26 episodes.

B003L5BRXK|5.0|I think this is the best Stones album, and not just because the hype machine says it is.  It has a flow that no other stones album can match.  Many people that do not get it perhaps are looking for greatest hits packages.  I am an album only purchaser, and do not buy singles or individual tracks.  While the Stones have many amazing songs, I would rather listen to Exile on Main Street over any other individual track.  I think other great top tier Stones albums are: Beggars Banquet, Goats Head Soup, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Some Girls.  As far as the best rock album of all time goes, I am more of a progressive rock listener and would likely choose Dark Side of the Moon.  You could make a case for that top spot with almost any Led Zeppelin album as well, but Exile On Main Street does stand up to all the best rock albums of all time.  Music is subjective, and I do love this album.    I own the two different remasters of this album, and I enjoy them both.  I am spending more time with this 2010 remaster right now since it sounds amazing in my car, on my computer, and in my mp3 player.  Mastering is changing since people listen to music different.  For example, I used to listen on a high end stereo, but now have moved to a computer and portable devices.

1573226521|4.0|I really was afraid to read this book, because back when Leonardo DiCaprio was good-looking I watched the movie. I should have realized earlier that the book would assuredly be better. Garland is brilliant, and considering this was a debut novel, I'm awed. The thing that impressed me most about the book was that despite having very little plot--location choices, if nothing else, were limited--you still wanted to inhale it and still wanted to see what would happen next.<br /><br />In many ways the \\"plot\\" is predictable. Richard, a young Englishman in Thailand, stays a few nights in a sleazy hotel where he is given a strange map of a supposedly deserted island-paradise by a strange person known only as Daffy Duck. The night after receiving Daffy's map, Richard finds him dead. Accompanied by two fellow hotel-guests (Francoise and Etienne), Richard decides to go to the island outlined on the map. Thinking that someone should know where they are going, Richard informs two American college students of his plans, giving them a copy of the map.<br /><br />Of course, what happens next is nothing unexpected. Adventures ensue as Richard, Francoise and Etienne try to make it to the designated location; upon their arrival they encounter a 'village' of about twenty people, some of whom are disappointed to learn of Daffy's death; the traveling trio decides to stay on the island, and Richard begins to panic that the Americans may show up; Richard continues to panic to the point of hallucination, and camp relations start to get tense; the Americans show up, the whole island oasis life is shot to hell, and Richard, Francoise and Etienne barely escape.<br /><br />Still, the book is addictive. It creates a feeling of suspense that I have not felt from another book. The characters and the interactions between them were increasingly complex. Issues of \\"Can utopia stay utopian?\\" \\"How selfish is this isolated, island lifestyle?\\" \\"Do vacations have to end?\\" and \\"When is this going to become like Lord of the Flies?\\" keep you turning the later pages.<br /><br />This is definitely a book worth buying, or at the very least checking out of a library. It really is an fun and sometimes thrilling read.\\" keep you turning the later pages.     This is definitely a book worth buying, or at the very least checking out of a library.

B003Y5H4SO|4.0|So says Vincent Laresca, a superstitious employee working at an ill fated, lavish hotel which happens to be in the sights of Beelzebub. This bit of dialogue is not meant to be taken seriously; on the contrary, one gets the sense that producer M. Night Shymalan is himself aware that people no longer expect brilliance from him, so why take himself so seriously? The ruse of the movie is Hitchcockian, and in that sense works very well: five people are trapped in an elevator and none of them are what one might call moral giants.  A mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green), an old woman (Jenny O'Hara), a young woman (Bojana Novakovic), a guard (Bokeem Woodbine) and a salesman (Geoffrey Arend) are very quick to lose their patience, panic, and start treating each other like garbage when their elevator becomes stuck. The point, of course, is that one of these five people is Satan, him or herself, and things go according to it's plan very well for awhile.<br /><br />No, this movie isn't going to change your life, nor is it meant to--but the ambiance Shymalan creates of having two hands around your neck is as good as any Twilight Zone episode I've seen, or any quality short horror film.  He focuses so much on the *faces* of each person in the unfortunate loft that one thinks of Polanksi in his more chilling films (\\"Rosemary's Baby\\") or the mounting tension of real life horror classics (\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\").  While this film does not quite match up to either of these classics, it is quite something to watch and the ending is not predictable at all.  It approaches from an angle which throws disbelief out the window immediately, and even Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) is forced to take a closer look at what he believes by the end.  A chilling little gem from which one should not expect genius, but genuine chills.

B000L53D4O|5.0|This is the best and most useful toy that I have bought my son yet. He is 8 months old and has had it for about two months. The 1st day he got it he fell over a few times and we had to offer support because he did not know how to shift and balance his weight. By the second day he mastered it by learning not to put all of his weight on the toy. Luckily, he is a fast learner. It may not be so great for those who are slow developers. I would not be as impressed if he was still falling due to the toy being very light weight and very fast moving. As for him, he uses it everyday all throughout the day. It is one of his favorite toys. He is now taking steps on his own but when done, goes back to grab it for support.

Presented a new look at all of the conceptions of life now and in the past. The Book of Man's History(Bible) does a good job of presenting a view of many authors in the past that lended a spiritual reality at a time when man needed someone to follow(Jesus Christ)as written.   Mr. Hawking here presents a different view with many proven facts that are not contrary to the writings of past authors, but an addition to the real understanding about the past and present, future of man.  Looking forward to Mr. Hawking's next book.

0765326353|4.0|It says much about the quality of the work of Brandon Sanderson that he was selected by Robert Jordan's wife to bring The Wheel of Time series to its conclusion. Its legacy certainly could not be left to just any writer brave enough to put pen to paper. Jordan, viewed as the king of epic fantasy, wore its crown for many years, and Sanderson had big shoes to fill.    Had Sanderson not been tabbed as the man to finish Jordan's work, he would still be echoing thunder across the fantasy worlds of bookshelves everywhere. His latest novel, THE WAY OF KINGS, shows that he has his own shoes and wears them very comfortably. Planned as a 10-book saga, it is the very epitome of epic fantasy, weighing in at a hefty 1,000+ pages. The world here is dense, majestic and alive, capturing imagination and awe on a level not seen since Stephen R. Donaldson's The Land in his Chronicles of Thomas Covenant.    The focus of this first volume of The Stormlight Archive is on the lives of three characters: Dalinar, Kaladin and Shallan. Dalinar is a general whose visions plague his dreams. He has sworn an oath to his fallen brother, the King, that he will live his life by a long-abandoned code of honor, swearing that the bickering nobility of the realm will be united with his guidance. These visions of the past are problematic, occurring during storms and sending him into convulsive fits. They have cost him the respect of his sons and of those he leads in combat, and most importantly, he has begun to question himself and his sanity.    Kaladin is the son of a surgeon who had no desire to follow in the footsteps of his father, seeking instead to find his glory on a battlefield. Along the way, however, he has been enslaved, taking a lead position as an unarmed \\"bridgeman\\" whose life should be forfeited, yet he continues to find success in the war on the Shattered Plain. And we come to learn that his bridge crew is an element of the army of the new king, and under the control of a nobleman caughtup in a feud with Dalinar.    Shallan is a young woman of desperation, hiding the secret of her father's death lest their lands be plundered by neighboring lords. She possesses a fantastic ability for retaining images in her head and drawing them from memory, and she seeks to apprentice with another strong woman of magic, a \\"heretic\\" named Jasnah, but her purpose is more nefarious than it would seem.    As THE WAY OF KINGS progresses, the trials and tribulations of these three characters are played out in rotating fashion, and eventually they begin to converge. Most impressive about this is that not one time does the work suffer from the shifts of character, nor do these stories become tedious. Each is rife with mystery and wonderment, and as the pieces begin to fit and connections are made to show the larger tapestry, it truly does become a marvel --- made all the more incredible with Roshar. A world of savage storms and harsh climate, Roshar is as sensational a product of world building as you are likely to encounter. From beasts to flora to the magic incorporated in Shardplate Armor and Shardblades, the world is imprinted in your mind vividly.    Sanderson does not talk down to his readers. In fact, he gives them credit for being endowed with thought and comprehension. As such, he doesn't belabor his creation with long-winded descriptions of things or explanations of why plants are the way they are or why magic works as it does. What he does --- and brilliantly I might add --- is drop you right into the story, and you begin your journey through Roshar and experience the surroundings as if they are second nature already. This doesn't mean you can just pick up THE WAY OF KINGS and fly through it. Doing so would force you to miss a great deal. You're not told about Roshar, you experience it. To not sit back and steep yourself in it would be a tragedy.    THE WAY OF KINGS is a huge book, in size and scope, and Sanderson has complete control. His storytelling is wellhoned, and the delivery is powerful. Those put off by large books (anything over 200 pages) would be well advised to overlook that phobia lest you miss out on a true masterwork of fantasy, the likes of which will not be surpassed this year...yes, even including the new Jordan/Sanderson installment, TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT, in November.    With THE WAY OF KINGS, Brandon Sanderson has effectively wrested control of the crown placed on the brow of the king of epic fantasy. Long live your new king.        --- Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard

0525951652|4.0|Historical fiction author Ken Follett has launched perhaps the most compelling literary challenge of his long and successful career with the much heralded publication of FALL OF GIANTS. This monumental trilogy will cover most of the 20th century, with the first book arriving at a whopping 985-page, action-packed saga of five families embroiled in the captivating events from 1911 through 1925.    These fateful 15 years will set the stage for the events that spawned the First World War and the tumultuous century to follow. Royal leaders continued to lose their feudal grip on nations around the world as the Russian Revolution erupted, turning the once western-friendly nation into an enemy by the end of the war that engulfed Western Europe.    In Wales, Billy Williams's 30th birthday is celebrated by descending into the coal mines, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. His elder sister, Ethel, is in service as a maid to Earl Fitzherbert, owner of the mines, and his wife, Princess Beatrice of Russia and his single sister, Lady Maud. Maud, a prominent London socialite, is active in the women's suffrage movement and romantically involved with Walter von Ulrich, a member of the German consulate in London. Gus Dewar is a wealthy young American who is an aide to President Woodrow Wilson and moves in the same London social circles with the Fitzherberts and von Ulrich.    On the other side of the world, brothers Lev and Grigori Peshkov, Russian orphans who grew up on the streets of Moscow, plan to seek their fortunes in America. As Europe moves inexorably toward war, their paths part in ways that will find them continents apart, with one playing an important role in the Bolshevik Revolution and the other becoming an American gangster.    The violent events of the first quarter of the 20th century are brought vividly to life through these five families. Follett, who has several blockbuster historical novels to his credit --- including PILLARS OF THE EARTH, which is currently running on television as a mini-series --- rounds out the characters so well that you are caught up in their lives from the first chapter. The page count may seem daunting, but unlike many novels by other well-known authors who are justifiably guilty of running overlong and wordy, he has chiseled his narrative to a fine point, and the pages fly.    One pitfall for historical novelists can be a question of accuracy and imagined conversations between the fictional characters and real historical figures. Follett himself answers that question by saying, \\"When real people have conversations with my fictional characters, they are usually saying things they really did say at some point.\\" His meticulous research of the published papers of Winston Churchill, Lloyd George, Woodrow Wilson and other prominent political figures, for instance, assures the persnickety reader that if the character was in another place or situation at the time, he leaves it out.    Probably the strongest point of the book is to bring to light why the First World War happened and why the Bolsheviks won the Russian Revolution. The seeming incomprehensibility of these two cataclysmic events that brought down four of the major aristocratic empires of Europe is brought to life through Follett's carefully drawn characters. The humiliating terms of the peace agreement that was forced on the Germans is offered not as an apology or softening on Germany's responsibility for their autocratic and inexcusable actions in World War I, but as an insight into how they helped lead up to the destabilization of Germany and the beginning of World War II.    FALL OF GIANTS comes to a close with the advent of Prohibition and Women's Suffrage, stopping just short of the next world-changing events: the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression. While Follett doesn't write the book with a cliffhanger ending, one can't help but wonder how our intrepid heroes and their progeny who have already survived the worst of what the first quarter-century had to throw at them will now fare. Follett plans to produce the second volume in 2012. Write quickly, Mr. Follett --- your audience awaits.        --- Reviewed by Roz Shea

B002ZG983M|5.0|This movie came highly recommended to me and boy, I was not disappointed. It is rockin fun, totally over the top. It's got action, but not hollywood glossed over action. It shows the real nasty side to all those blows superheroes get. Kick-Ass has got heart, it's funny as hell and it's quite frankly eye-popping and unforgettable. I think it sets a new standard. I'll watch it again and again. The script is sharp and smart, especially when it's not obviously trying to be. I'd recommend this for action-lovers, those looking for something fresh and exciting, and for anyone tired of the same-old, same-old. This movie is entertaining as hell. Hit Girl owns it!

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I heard about Spartacus from a friend.  The first two episodes may seem like a drag but it sets up for the rest of the series. After the 3rd episode I was hooked. Great casts, my favorite character was Batiatus. There is plenty of nudity and violence to satisfy any man or woman. I loved Rome the series because it showed the flaw of people, and how men of power in those times were greatly influenced by the woman.  This show also reflects those ideas. Of the people who gave really bad reviews for this show, many of them seemed put-off by the nudity and the gore, which I think was necessary, not to mention awesome. Andy Whitfield makes a great Spartacus, best wishes to him and his family. Go Watch!

1602831777|3.0|This was an interesting & well written story, but it left me feeling quite conflicted. There were some significant things that disturbed me, starting with the protagonist's tendency to blame everything bad that happened to his home country (Pakistan) on the United States. This is such an overreaching attitude, particular considering that conflict in the Middle East has existed as long as the Middle East itself, and blaming the US for the aggressions shown by various ME countries toward others is a convenient and currently popular sentiment, but not grounded in the realities of the relationships between the ME countries themselves.<br /><br />What was perhaps the most disturbing issue for me was Changez's reaction of pleasure at the attacks against the US on September 11. This troubled me throughout the rest of the book, especially as the antagonistic feelings he had toward the US intensified, even as he was taking advantage of the opportunities the US had (has) to offer that were not available to him in his own country. I simply do not understand hating a country & what it stands for, but at the same time coveting the opportunities there, and thus doing whatever was necessary to pursue a US education & employment.<br /><br />Tied into the above is the absence of ethical responsibility Changez ultimately showed toward his employer, an employer who went out on a limb for him on more than one occasion. His \\"guilt\\" seemed only to involve letting Jim down (his hiring manager), but not about derailing the project he was working on or leaving the company in a bad position. His attitude had become so negative toward the US that he could not even bring himself to fulfill his employment obligations in a professional & ethical way, even though the US was the country that had afforded him the opportunities.<br /><br />Finally, the whole premise of the book (a conversation between Changez and an unidentified American) left me with a feeling of being set up. The ending is ambiguous enough - both in content of Changez's monologue and as to what actually did/did not happen with the American - that it left me as the reader feeling as though the author wanted me to assume what happened next, and based on the story & the trajectory of Changez's life, one ending seems much more plausible than another.<br /><br />So at the end of the reading I am conflicted, because it could have actually been a much better story, even with the anti-US sentiment, if the protagonist had actually had some personal ethics rather than allowing his politics to inform & dictate his actions. I hated that about him, and while the writing was good, my inability to connect on even the smallest level with Changez impacted my overall assessment of the book.ent of Changez's monologue and as to what actually did/did not happen with the American - that it left me as the reader feeling as though the author wanted me to assume what happened next, and based on the story & the trajectory of Changez's life, one ending seems much more plausible than another.

B000P0J09M|5.0|Good Fellas is a movie with everything working for it. Taking in consideration for the director, actors, movie crew, script, editing, and what ever else you can look at in order to develop and over all critic a movie; there is no wonder to why this movie is a favorite among millions.    The five stars rating is a personal opinion based not just on different aspects required to put a movie together (crew, editing, etc.), but style and other personal likes.    Firstly, the movie is based on actual events. Some may waive this in saying it is not important as it does not mean whether or not everything happened as in the movie. Perfect example would be \\"the social network\\". A movie based on a single event in someone's life, yet depicting that moment in the classic Hollywood fashion in over exaggerating as well as substituting actuality with fiction. However, in comparison \\"GoodFellas\\" (if one was interested in historical facts) is not just one step, but several steps closer to the actual \\"Henry Hill\\" (names are swapped for fictional names).    Beyond the above social interest in why a person may join the mob (and like this movie), there is still a fantastic romantic view provided along with it's harsh reality. A difficult task made to look easy. With it; a person easily slips into the story as if he/she was actually there. Only made possible by the production crew and everyone else who worked on the film.    \\"Good Fellas\\" was written, directed, and edited wonderfully which could be used for up coming movie enthusiasts, or to just sit back and relax for pure entertainment value. Having owned a copy for a few years, I have watched it close to 25 times if not more. Clearly it is a favorite.    Which is why I added a fifth star. Normally I am comfortable in saying that a movie is four stars as most are. Not everything goes perfect in creating a movie, and even after post production there could still be little pieces or trivial aspects that do not work or seem to be off. \\"Good Fellas\\" is no way different, but remains easier to view. Adding to reasons why it is so easy to watch again and again.

B001EN71CW|5.0|If you're reading this review, you already know that Firefly is a must-have Blu-ray.  It's already a cult classic and is possibly destined to become a true sci-fi classic many years down the road.  I won't get into the plot here, but focus on the Blu-ray specifics.  It comes down to this: if you're a fan, or you think you might become a fan, get this on Blu-ray.  You should really see it on a big screen in great quality.  I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much if it was DVD quality.  The video and audio are standard Blu-ray quality.  I'm not a fan of the menu, which is minimalist, but I'm really looking to nitpick here, since there's really nothing bad to say about the disc itself.    I do recommend that you buy this somewhere other than Amazon, though.  I bought mine and while it was in the mail, the price dropped significantly.  Amazon is the only major retailer that I know of that doesn't offer a price guarantee.  Only buy it at Amazon if it's an unbeatable price, otherwise you'll be losing money without a doubt.  For those of you who are not familiar with price guarantee, it means that if you buy something (for example) for $60 and a couple weeks later it's on sale for $30, you get reimbursed for the difference.  It basically gives you the confidence to buy something right now without worrying that you'll get dinged by a sale the next day.  Price matching, on the other hand, means that a company will sell it to you for the same price that the competition is offering.  Amazon used to offer price guarantees, but no longer.  I won't be buying anything from them until either this changes or I see a price that is so low that I can't resist it.      In conclusion, great Blu-ray, but buy it somewhere else!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|It's always a special thrill to see a movie that takes an actor and perfectly melds him to a role.  Particularly when it happens for the first time for that actor.  Young Jesse Eisenberg has at last had this happen to him in David Fincher's fun and super-smart THE SOCIAL NETWORK.  Eisenberg plays Facebook \\"founder\\" (I put that in quotes, because the whole movie is somewhat about the idea that perhaps all the credit is NOT due) Mark Zuckerberg.  In the past, Eisenberg has excelled at the smart nerd, the awkward guy who never does well with the ladies because he's just a little bit unconventional looking and a little bit smarter than everyone else.  In ADVENTURE LAND, he was funny but I didn't find him entirely convincing.  His character was a smart**s, but you also felt he would probably always be a bit of a loser.  I didn't completely warm up to him.  In the excellent ZOMBIELAND, he played his part very well, but let's face it...his role never had \\"Award season darling\\" written on it.    However, as the difficult to like Zuckerberg, Eisenberg takes Aaron Sorkin's sharp, almost preternaturally smart dialogue and knocks it out of the park.  Zuckerberg, as presented here, is deeply unlikeable, because he's the smartest guy on campus but also deeply insecure.  He speaks his mind, which is often unpleasant...because he does so in the most condescending ways possible.  He doesn't intend to be a jerk...but he doesn't intend NOT to be either.  Eisenberg fires on all cylinders here...and it was a blast to watch.    Equally exciting was to enjoy virtually all the other performances as well.  Most sympathetic was Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, the CFO of Facebook...and Zuckerberg's only true friend.  His Saverin comes across as slightly fussy and old-fashioned...but with sincere motives and a heart-on-his-sleeve attitude towards business.  It's an attitude that we admire, even as we see it is so totally wrong for the high paced business of the not so distant past when Facebook sprung into being at the height of our economic success in the early 2000s.  He believes that friendship and honesty mean something...and is run over because of it.  The guiltiest pleasures came from Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, the founder of Napster.  He's a high-flying huckster.  A womanizer and charmer...clearly super smart and marketing savvy...but he also oozes insincerity.  Timberlake must now be considered a full-blown actor...not just a charming performer of self-effacing sketches on SNL.  He utterly steals the scenes he is in...and he has no compunction about being even more unlikeable than Zuckerberg.  While the performance is not exactly a revelation (it doesn't stretch him THAT much)...it can't be ignored or laughed-off either.  I also enjoyed Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss Twins...some of the folks from whom Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea of Facebook.    THE SOCIAL NETWORK essentially tells the story of the development of Facebook.  It works on a big, social commentary stage...showing us WHY the human race seems to be wired to embrace such a \\"network.\\"  If you explain to someone what Facebook is...it sounds trite and self-serving.  But in reality, it has woven itself into the fabric of society.  But THE SOCIAL NETWORK is about personal disappointment, achievement, betrayal and entitlement.  If Spiderman was supposed to know that \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\", someone needed to tell Zuckerberg that with great intelligence comes great responsibility.  He's like a super-hero of coding.  But he's a villain when it comes to dealing with others.  We see strong friendships collapse, partnerships fray and desires corrupt.      Fincher, over the years, has shown himself to be a director of great style.  Certainly in works such as SEVEN, FIGHT CLUB & PANIC ROOM, his style has enabled him to overcome stories that wouldn't have worked in less technically skilled hands.  And he's had a knack for casting just the right folks to help him out.  But those movies were entertainments...a story about a serial killer, a home invasion and a group of guys who beat each other up (yes, I know some think FIGHT CLUB had social commentary to offer...but that commentary was not exactly new and original...just presented in a new and original way).  With ZODIAC, Fincher tackled a true story that sprawled across years and personalities.  It was very well made, but was also often turgid and needlessly focused on miniscule details.  With THE SOCIAL NETWORK, Fincher has polished his craft.  It always moves fast.  It focuses on details (such as Severin & Zuckerberg talking about algorithms), but with such verve and authority that it never bores.  It follows a true story, but with the rhythms of fiction.  And Sorkin, whose writing often makes me think this is what Neil Simon scripts would have sounded like if he'd written political stories instead of romantic comedies, has actually wrestled this story into a compelling package.  His writing always makes everyone sound much smarter than anyone is in real life (just as Simon made folks sound FUNNIER than anyone is in real life)...but here, he's got characters that we actually believe COULD talk this way.    I wasn't sure I would like this film.  I don't use Facebook myself (yet) and I just wasn't convinced I could like a film all about the rich brats who invented it and then squabbled about it.  But after enjoying the excellent script and near Oscar caliber performances...I left knowing I'd thoroughly enjoyed one of the best films of the year thus far.

But then, the simple concepts suddenly are integral part of some amazing revelations.  It blew my mind. There aren't any equations in the book. The book is in line with metaphysics.

After about 6 months of light use the fan developed a rattle which sounds like the hard drive is constantly running. At first it was a great value but now I have to replace the fan which adds to the over all cost.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|$20 for a ebook?  When I bought my Kindle in April of 2008 I was thrilled with it and with the convenience of buying wirelessly, but the biggest factor was the cost of the books themselves.  At this rate I might as well wait until a book I want is in the bargain table at barnes and noble or I simply will get it from my library.  It seems to me to be crazy to buy an item for $20 which you can't even share with someone else or resell once you read it.  Where is the justification for charging practically the same price for a ebook as a physical book.  There is no printing on paper, no shipping to bookstores.  Logically it would seem that publishers and authors would want to encourage ebooks since it is a one to a customer deal.  If anyone wants it they have to buy it since it can't be shared.  Come on guys $9.99 is the right price for any book.

B001FB4VZS|4.0|I started watching SMALLVILLE (which premiered in 2001) on a first run basis with this SEASON 8 (that I'm reviewing). I'd heard about the show back during it's pre-series premiere period and had obviously seen Tom Welling and immediately saw why (from a physical standpoint) was a good choice for the role. But, as the old saying goes, \\"The proof is in the pudding\\", so I had to actually see for myself. I knew that the show really was supposed to be about Clark Kent before he became Superman, but obviously since the show kept going for so long, they couldn't avoid him growing up and having to start working at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. Having bought the dvds of all previous seasons (1 to 7), the show presents it's own unique twist on the Superman legend. So for those 7 seasons, the show was pretty much set strictly in Smallville, Kansas with a \\"teen-aged\\" Clark Kent, starting out as a kind of teen detective investigating mysterious goings-on in Smallville (Seasons 1-3), then shifting more towards learning about his true identity and destiny (Seasons 4-7). Then in comes SEASON 8 and now he's FINALLY working at the DP in Metropolis (which happens to be nearby his hometown!) and morphing into a real superhero!     Before I get into the meat of my review, I've got to say that I think Tom Welling was a great choice for the role. He perfectly plays Clark as a sweet, slightly awkward and guarded innocent youth, not the faux geeky, clumsy Clark putting on a ruse for the rest of the world. That is, he is just being himself! It's kind of like watching Superman if he were walking around as he is one of us...which he actually is on this show! And Welling is still convincing looking like a hero-in-the-making and pulling off saves from week-toweek. He's done a very commendable job of carrying the series for it's run. SEASON 8 is the start of Welling being allowed to give Clark more depth, complexity, and maturity, but still embodying the boyish charm that he had in previous seasons, with still lingering desires and ties to his former small town life.    SEASON 8 is interesting b/c I didn't realize how long the character Lois Lane (played wonderfully by Erica Durance) had been on the show. I think I saw a glimpse of an episode from an earlier season by accident (when I was channel-flipping!) with her in it and at the time thought, \\"Oh, so they decided to bring Lois Lane into Smallville!\\". I actually remember it was a scene with Clark where they didn't seem to get along at all! Lois was actually introduced in the Season 4 premiere episode CRUSADE as the cousin of Chloe Sullivan (played by the refreshing Allison Mack, who's been part of the main cast since the show's inception in 2001). I needed to see the earlier episodes to gain some perspective on the current ones and see that Clark and Lois have always had this witty, snappy banter from their first meeting (there were actually times when you could have confused them for feuding siblings!). A kind of pre-cursor to their future, iconic sympatico once the Superman story kicks off. The weird thing is that bringing Lois onto the show would seem like a bad idea, but it is the total opposite! Lois and her interactions with Clark made Season 4 for me, and is really a large part of the progression and maturity of Clark Kent, whereas other characters in one way or another seemed to keep him tied down.    Early SEASON 8 was kind of a transition period trying to make Metropolis the main backdrop of storylines and the start was a tad shaky, as the show was undergoing a major overhaul with half of the cast being newcomers, so the viewer had to all of a sudden get used to fresh new faces. The season premiere Episode 1-ODYSSEY was a mixed big, starting with great action sequence in the Arctic at the remains of the Fortress of Solitude (destroyed by Lex Luthor at the end of Season 7, with he and Clark being caught in the explosion), then dual rescue attempts of Clark (in Russia) and Chloe (in a Luthorcorp Nevada facility) by Oliver Queen aka The Green Arrow (new series regular Justin Hartley, who was only a recurring character in Season 6 and appeared in only one episode in Season 7) and Lois, respectively, then some ethereal nonsense with the Martian Manhunter character aka John Jones, culminating in Clark and Lois becoming partner reporters at the DP; also a new character Tess Mercer (played with delicious complexity by fiery redhead Cassidy Freeman) is introduced as Lex Luthor's top assistant that he put in charge of his corporation Luthorcorp in case he became incapacitated (as he did in Season 7 finale ARCTIC). Standout eps of early SEASON 8 include Ep 5-COMMITTED (an iconic Lois and Clark episode!) and Ep 6-PREY (the beginnings of the Doomsday storyline, with new regular Sam Witwer playing paramedic Davis Bloome, who alter ego is Doomsday). Also, the impending marriage of Chloe and Jimmy Olsen (played hilariously by regular Aaron Ashmore since Season 6) plays a big part in early SEASON 8. Generally, early SEASON 8 has an iconic Superman feel, but Clark hasn't fully assumed that identity yet and instead saves people under the moniker \\"The Red-Blue Blur\\", or RBB for short. Another big part of early SEASON 8 is Lois surprisingly having strong feelings towards Clark that she didn't expect to have, but Clark being totally oblivious to them! An ironic twist of the legend where usually Clark falls for Lois first, but this is a neat aspect of this show that I like, the way the sometimes tweak the mythos, in this case with positive results. For me, it is a more realistic interpretation of the mythos, giving Lois real vulnerability and humanity.    Upon careful re-watch of early SEASON 8, it's obvious that the show hadn't completely cut the ties to earlier seasons. Clark still wasn't over his first love Lana Lang (more on her later!). Early SEASON 8 eps slyly foretold (knowing Lana was to return for a brief mid-season stint that would end her storyline) that Clark needed a major life change to help push him to becoming what he was really meant to be. Also, early on, it was hard for Clark to let go of Chloe knowing that marrying Jimmy would change things between them forever. The Clark-Chloe and Clark-Lana subplots still have a lingering effect in early SEASON 8 eps (with only references to Lana since she still hadn't shown back up yet), and even weaker ones like 2-PLASTIQUE and 4-INSTINCT show Clark as being very guarded and emotionally distant and unsure of he is on the right path. Welling really gives a nuanced performance that illustrates that his version of Clark Kent is perhaps the most \\"human\\" of all incarnations. Yet throughout all of the early season, Clark was repeatedly given hints that he did have feelings for Lois, in some cases by people close to him (Chloe in TOXIC, his cousin Kara in BLOODLINE) and even outside forces sensed their deep connection that neither Clark nor Lois seemed to want to admit. Clark was still so emotionally fragile and grounded and Lois so stubborn and resolved, that they kept their feelings hidden.    Moving toward the mid-part of SEASON 8, there is a 5-episode story arc (Eps 10-BRIDE, 11-LEGION, 12-BULLETPROOF, 13-POWER, 14-REQUIEM) that re-introduces the character of Lana Lang (admirably reprised by Season 1 to 7 regular Kristin Kreuk).  Kreuk had to honor her contract b/c she left 5 episodes early at the end of Season 7 to do a film. The first couple of episodes (BRIDE and LEGION) were smashingly good! Ep 10-BRIDE, the ep of Chloe and Jimmy's wedding, was a season standout with emotions running high between Lois and Clark and they are about to kiss at the wedding reception when Lana returns; then Lana and Clark had a great discussion scene about their tortuous relationship that is one of the most mature ones I've ever seen them have on the show; this scene illustrates how guilty and responsible Clark always felt about Lana and also that Lana didn't necessarily need Clark in her life to survive; then there was a truly horrifying Cloverfield-type scene with an attack by Doomsday on the wedding party, with Doomsday (under the influence of Brainiac) kidnapping Chloe; other results include Jimmy being seriously wounded and Lois deciding to accompany him to Star City for his recovery; so Lois leaving left the door open for Lana to insinuate herself back into Clark's life. Lana just kind of occupied space in 11-LEGION, the most purely entertaining episode of the season, with a trio of Legionnaires who returned from the future to help Clark find Chloe, who has been infected by Brainiac to take over the world. The plot of 12-BULLETPROOF (about bad cops) was weak, but the parts including or dealing with Lana were good, especially a key conversation between Chloe and Clark about Lana's return, Clark's inability to let go of her, and his unexpected feelings for Lois. It looked like Clana was going to end the right way! But 13-POWER (directed by co-star Allison Mack) was the most obvious worst episode of Season 8. It is a weird episode with poorly handled flashback scenes, terrible lighting, horrendous dialogue, and bad acting; it \\"explains\\" why Lana really left late in Season 7 and is really a poorly done retcon. Then there is 14-REQUIEM, a good episode with the return of an incapaciated Lex Luthor (a double for Michael Rosenbaum with tubes covering his face to mask him) pulling the strings as a Kryptonite bomb is about to destroy Metropolis. Lana had actually started to confront her inner demons in late Season 7 and Lana's departure in Season 7 made total sense based on the way that Season 7 shaped up, then the show's producers made the ridiculous decision to retcon it with the storyline of POWER, which to an extent betrayed and undermined both the character progressions of Lana (late Season 7) and Clark (early Season 8); the end scene of POWER shows Clark's growing doubt and confusion and Lana's misguided good intentions, but once again Lana intoxicates Clarkand leads him astray; then REQUIEM pulls the doomed lovers apart forever. I feel the Lana arc SEASON 8 should have either (A) been done at the end of Season 7 (which unforunately was not possible), (B) been handled differently, or (C) not done at all. But at the end of the day, given that SMALLVILLE initially revolved around Clark, Lana, and Lex, I view this arc as the end of the old days of SMALLVILLE. For me, this arc just re-inforces the fact that Clark-Lana as a couple were for the most part a doomed relatonship, and when they were together, they were never really happy with each other and ultimately, just plain incompatibile. Their relationship started out sweet in early seasons, but degenerated into something very non-descript in later seasons; I think the final decision to end them the way they did was more a way to satisfy \\"Smallville\\" fans, since the show started with them, than to satisfy \\"Superman\\" fans, although there are a LOT of Smallville fans that actually don't like it, including myself!    Understand that Lana Lang was Clark's FIRST love, but not his TRUE love (big difference!). At this point, although being very protective of and somewhat attracted to Lois, Clark didn't see the possibilities with her. Lois is a very gorgeous woman, but make no mistake, there is MUCH more to her than meets the eye! She is amazingly tough, resilient, ambitious, and forthright, but she is surprisingly vulnerable and sensitive at times also. What I like about the Clark-Lois dynamic on SMALLVILLE is that they literally complement each other to the point that neither of them knows it! Clark is able to penetrate Lois' tough exterior and see where she's really coming from and Lois activates Clark's protective instincts, but in a very positive way that makes him act more like a man. There were many times in prior seasons where Clark's overprotectiveness of Lana bordered on obsession and was almost one-sided where she would either accuse him of hiding secrets from her and wouldn't accept that he was just doing it out of love (the fact is, several times she was right!); this lingering mistrust spelled doom for their relationship! But with Lois, she accepts Clark for his humanity and just sees him as a truly nice guy with the best intentions. It's an amazingly refreshing twist on the mythology where Lois Lane is usually all starry-eyed for Superman and treats Clark Kent like utter crap! I much prefer SMALLVILLE's interpretation of Lois and Clark!    Prior to SEASON 8, Clark-Lois were really frenemies who had unknown deep-seated feelings for each other that EVERYONE else could see, but neither of them could! Lois had been on the show for 4 full seasons by SEASON 8 and she and Clark had established as much of an important relationship (I'd say more important) than either of his relationships with Lana or Chloe (who Clark had also had a brief relationship with in Seasons 1 and 2), but Clark couldn't really see the big picture with Lois, only seeing her as a close friend and partner; and Lois kept her strong feelings for Clark deeply hidden and would always change the conversation between them when things got deep or intense; Lana always had his heart, but Clark could never really talk or be honest with her, while Chloe could totally relate to and converse with Clark, but Clark never had strong enough feelings for her other than friendship; the show did a brilliant job of showing the incompatibility of Clark and Chloe as a couple and that they were much better off as best friends; and Clark and Chloe never got involved deep enough for their friendship to ever seem awkward; the Clark-Chloe friendship is a major reason why SEASON 8 is so good, with Tom Welling and Allison Mack having to carry the show appearing in every episode, with the rest of the cast revolving around them and only appearing in limited fashion. But given her limited appearances, Erica Durance made the most of her portrayal of Lois Lane, proving that she could play the iconic character in her own special way and also why she is the perfect counterpart to Clark. Clark and Lois maintained their \\"frenemy\\" relationship in SEASON 8, but also injected it with a lot of sexual innuendo that indicated there were signs of real sparks and attraction. Welling and Durance just plain have that IT factor that is too strong to ignore!    After Lana left, the show swiftly made up for the Lana arc with an immensely strong episode entitled 15-INFAMOUS, one of my faves of the season, revealing why LOIS is truly THE ONE for Clark! In this ep, Clark, compelled by evil down-and-out meteor freak reporter Linda Lake (guest star Tori Spelling in a fun, hammy, yet juicy performance, reprising her role from the Season 6 ep HYDRO) to admit to the world that he's the RBB, reveals his secret to Lois, but everything goes awry and Clark must use the time-travelling Legion ring (given to him in LEGION) to go back long enough to thwart Lake, but not before Lois bares her soul to Clark; it is Lois' big revelation where Clark Kent realized that SHE is his true soulmate, so the rest of the season has Clark beginning his quest to become the man and superhero worthy of a woman like Lois; his first priority is to protect Lois from knowing his secret at all costs to keep her safe, but also he doesn't want things with her to end the way they did with Lana; he decides to express his feelings for Lois as the RBB, so the show takes on more of the \\"Superman\\" vibe with Lois beginning to fall for the RBB and Clark having to bide his time to express his feelings for her, starting in Ep 19-STILETTO. Ep 17-HEX (where Chloe gets a wish to be Lois for a day) is a great one, with Erica Durance winningly mimicking Allison Mack as \\"Chlois\\" and Tom Welling matching her beat for beat playing the \\"iconic\\" version of Clark Kent. Later SEASON 8 also shifted more focus more on the Doomsday storyline with the powerful, tragic Ep 18-ETERNAL, a retcon ep explaining how Davis-Doomsday came to earth as a boy; we learn that Davis knew Lex Luthor as a child and there is a debate as to which one is truly Clark's worst enemy; as Chloe finds herself falling for Davis, but torn between her feelings for him and protecting Clark; thinking she has killed Davis with massive amounts of Kryptonite, turns out it only made Doomsday stronger and so Chloe opts to help Davis (to keep him from becoming the beast again) and they runaway together. Late SEASON 8 has Clark and the Justice League searching for Chloe and Davis and trying to defeat Doomsday. The season finale Ep 22-DOOMSDAY was sadly a disappointment overall, though, with a decision that actually managed to top the ones in POWER and REQUIEM in utter absurdity (although there is one VERY iconic scene involving Clark and Jimmy that is just plain AWESOME). Still, with the stories shifted to Metropolis over Smallville, SEASON 8 definitely has a more Superman appeal to it than prior ones.     SEASON 8 regulars: Tom Welling, Allison Mack, Erica Durance, Aaron Ashmore, Cassidy Freman, Sam Witwer, Justin Hartley

B003HGKJH8|5.0|I don't listen to a lot of new bands these days (I'm getting old and unhip, I'll admit it), but this Tame Impala album woke me up to some amazing young talent out there (from Perth, Australia).  When I first heard Impala's music on public radio, I found it intriguing for its mix of Beatles-like vocals and lush guitars.  But their music goes beyond Beatles imitation.  Far beyond that.    At first blush, the album seems like a throw-back to classic rock -- to late-60s psychedelic rock to be specific -- but Tame Impala has updated that sound with touches of shoe-gazer and dream pop with just enough teeth to keep things interesting.  And their lyrics are often clever and thought-provoking.  The effect is undeniably contemporary.      The musicianship is top-rate without being pretentious, with a lushness to it that will put you in a trance.  This is truly one of the best releases I've heard in the rock genre over the last several years.

0061433047|5.0|Is it possible for the end of something to be both genuinely sad and yet utterly satisfactory? Sobered but satisfied might describe the legions of Terry Pratchett fans who, with I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT, will arrive at the end of his four-volume mini-series featuring the coming of age of apprentice witch Tiffany Aching.     When readers first met Tiffany in THE WEE FREE MEN, she was nine, a country girl in too-big boots, an aspiring cheese maker, unaware of her hidden talents as a witch until she was plucked off the Chalk and whisked away to the mountains to learn the often thankless art of witchcraft. Here, in her fourth and final adventure, Tiffany is 16, \\"a witch alone,\\" operating free of the control of Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and the other senior witches --- but always, of course, looked after (whether she likes it or not) by her fiercest and fondest companions: the tiny blue Nac Mac Feegle, who follow her everywhere and would defend her to the death.     At the opening of I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT, Tiffany has discovered that being a witch means bearing all kinds of pain, acknowledging truths that most people ignore, facing difficulties that many never have to view head-on. Tiffany is learning that the life of a witch is hard, painful and often lonely (no matter how many Feegles might follow you), but also necessary to the well-being of her people: \\"You know how Granny Aching always used to say: `Feed them as is hungry, clothe them as is naked, speak up for them as has no voices'? Tiffany says. Well, I reckon there is room in there for `Grasp for them as can't bend, reach for them as can't stretch, wipe for them as can't twist,' don't you? And because sometimes you get a good day that makes up for all the bad days and, just for a moment, you hear the world turning.\\"     Tiffany is both passionate and pragmatic about her work as a witch, but doing that work is becoming increasingly difficult, as a malevolent presence seems to be turning folks against witchcraft ingeneral and Tiffany in particular. What's more, the Baron, the head nobleman in Tiffany's district, is at death's door, and his son Roland, Tiffany's childhood sweetheart, is poised to marry a young woman who couldn't be less like Tiffany (at least on the surface). Just as she's about to face her most daunting foe --- a task that will require proving herself in front of her teachers and peers --- Tiffany feels more alone than ever.     Although the four books featuring Tiffany Aching have been marketed to younger readers, they are part of Pratchett's expansive and endlessly entertaining Discworld series. I SHALL WEAR MIDNIGHT seems, in many ways, the most closely integrated into the rest of Discworld, as Tiffany journeys to the bustling city of Ankh-Morpork and even receives essential (if cryptic) counsel from one of Pratchett's earliest heroines. Perhaps Pratchett, as he draws this cycle to a close, is gently nudging his younger readers toward the riches that lie outside the Chalk but within the rest of Discworld.    As one character remarks to young Tiffany near the end of the novel, \\"Classic endings to a romantic story are a wedding or a legacy, and you have been the engineer of one of each.\\" Certainly Pratchett, a storyteller for the ages, knows how to craft a fulfilling, classic ending. Those who want to see Tiffany succeed in her chosen craft will cheer her on; those who long for her to find love might be surprised, but not disappointed, at what (or, rather, whom) she finds. Even those pesky, lovable, unforgettable Nac Mac Feegle receive their ultimate reward. So, although readers might at first be cursing \\"Crivens!\\" at the thought of never hearing from Tiffany, Rob Anybody, or Daft Wullie again, they can close the book on their adventures with a deep sigh of contentment. \\"All's right with the (Disc)world\\".       --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl

0515123447|4.0|This book has been reviewed a lot, but I thought I would add a comment or two.  As stated earlier, it is a very good book for an author's first publication.  Like other's, I enjoyed it even with some of the \\"coincidences\\" that seemed a little too convenient.  Now that Child has written over a dozen such books, I think he should consider making Jack a little more human.  He has now killed or maimed at least 75 people, but \\"they\\" never quite get him.  He also beds just about every women he meets... and then leaves them a day or two later.  Jack's love of Royce in this book seems fairly real (if not fast)until the last 4 pages in which they dump each other.  Lee Child can do better (as can be seen in some of his better chapters....)but he needs to quit the old story line and apply himself to a couple of much better books.  I would buy those books in a second.  I gave him a 4 for this 1st book, but if I rated the 5 I have read altogether, he would end up a three + star.
B0025KVLTC|1.0|\\"Revolver\\" is, without doubt, my favorite Beatles album and one of my all-time favorites by any band or performer.  I had the old version of this cd (the one with the plastic jewel case) and was always rather dissapointed with the rather poor sound quality. (nothing can beat the sound quality of vinyl!!)  So I was so happy to see this album remastered, and sold seperately (without having to purchase the entire catalog as a box set.) I cannot begin to convey my utter dissapointment with this cd!!  Were they kidding when they called it \\"remastered\\"?!?!  It must be some sort of sick joke!  There is ABSOLUTELY no difference in sound quality between this version and the old one!!!!  If you already own the old version (the one that comes in a plastic jewel case), then that's all you need.  Don't waste your money like I did, thinking that you're going to finally get a copy of \\"Revolver\\" that has superior sound quality!  Aside from some fancy packaging, this re-release is nothing but a real let-down!!

034537410X|5.0|In Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming, LaBerge provides a detailed, albeit borderline \\"how-to\\" manual on lucid dreaming, which encompasses a wide variety of techniques, so there is definitely at least one that will work for everyone. Furthermore, LaBerge goes into a thorough description of the applications of lucid dreaming to real life, which proves to be quite interesting and even motivational in a very scientific approach. However, despite this and the very goal-oriented aspects of the book, this scientific approach proves to be very reductionist, so while still inspirational, one should look towards other literature for inspiration as well as motivation is a key component of lucid dreaming. From my personal experience with the book, I highly recommend this book for people new to the concept of lucid dreaming that would like to try it out.    Through the incorporation of psychological studies, Tibetan dream yoga, other dream research and beliefs (such as that of Jung and Freud), and his own research at the Lucidity Institute in Stanford University, LaBerge has created a book capable of teaching even the most closed-minded of people to lucid dream. The book contains every main technique with clear instructions including a detailed description of the technique he pioneered, known as the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, or MILD.     From the very beginning of the book, Dr. LaBerge reveals many personal experiences of other people who have written to him, thus providing a fantastical background on lucid dreaming and the expectations which can be enjoyed from reading this book. Furthermore, LaBerge also provides a FAQ for many skeptics of lucid dreaming (such as myself) who were unsure of the \\"risks\\" of lucid dreaming or whether they would be able to. LaBerge also provides a series of tips and tricks for beginners, such as keeping a dream journal, focusing on the idea of dreaming before sleeping, and \\"reality checks\\". The next few chapters provide detailed techniques to induce a lucid dream, specifically the WILD and MILD techniques. By Chapter 6, most of the induction techniques will be exhausted, and LaBerge then focuses on showing readers how to improve their achieved lucidity- how to retain their lucidity, prevent premature awakenings, awaken when desiring to do so, and guide dreams intelligently. Towards the last few chapters of the book, Dr. LaBerge even goes through many of the applications of the book, such as enjoyment in action, adventure, romance, and pleasure, spiritual growth, relieving oneself/exploring the dark side of nightmares, and rehearsal of daily life. The applications tie in the greater scheme of why one is to try lucid dreaming in the first place.    After you have reached an advanced stage of lucid dreaming, the book invites you to take a new dimension with expansion of your ability regarding lucid dreaming to break all types of self-defined parameters. You can explore the dream stage to an even greater extent by constantly proving to yourself that you can go another step forward. Laberge discusses seeking out mutual dreams or trying to exercise precognition by getting a dream character to speak or write to you about a future incident. You may also try to alter the course of events of something happening in reality (LaBerge has a very fascinating personal experience with precognition involving his son and how he may have saved a life).    In a quote from the book, LaBerge states, \\"According to `The Doctrine of the Dream State' an ancient Tibetan manual of lucid dream yoga, the practice of certain dream control techniques lead to the capacity to dream anything imaginable. Tulku makes a similar claim, `Advanced yogis are able to do just about anything in their dreams. They can become larger or smaller or disappear, go back into childhood and relive experiences, or even fly through space\\". Despite the seemingly extravagant claim, this is all very possible. The Tibetans heavily influenced LaBerge and today's lucid dreamers as they have been lucid dreaming for more than a thousand years.  Their experiences and techniques have influenced many of the applications we believe in today and add further credibility to the use of these applications.    Such applications proved to be extremely interesting, and all were further discussed with their own set of a \\"how-to\\", thus backed up by a good amount of fact. For example, in the idea of rehearsal of daily life, one could learn how to improve athleticism by learning dance moves or shooting a basketball over and over again. One could improve their confidence in these sports as well as other activities such as public speaking by having lucid dreams involving speaking in front of large crowds.     Other interesting applications were problem solving and healing. A lucid dream can be a stage for all your problem solving purposes. Lucid dreams can provide countless trial and error situations to determine what kind of solution would work in reality. The metaphysical aspect of healing is discussed thoroughly as well, with interesting probed ideas such as whether or not the physical body can be healed of disease if the dream body is healed and whether various avenues of healing can be used in an attempt to help a particular ailing person.    The metaphysical aspect I found most intriguing involved understanding the self. It was how LaBerge showed that lucid dreaming can have a deep spiritual effect toward understanding ourselves if we were to surrender our egos and allow our dream to take us somewhere rather than us trying to control it. Another quote taken from Tulku in this book, truly summed up the power of lucid dreaming; \\"Dreams are a reservoir of knowledge and experience, yet they are often overlooked as a vehicle for exploring reality.\\" One of the greatest things I have garnered from reading this book is that we can learn so much from lucid dreams about life, death, and the time in between.    If you are new to the concept of lucid dreaming, and would like to try it out, then this book is for you. Before reading I could only rarely recall dreams, and although I am still unable to lucid dream, it has only been a month and I can now recall dreams almost every night and even choose what I dream about before I sleep. I have yet to even try most of the techniques in this book, and I'm still very excited. The applications of this book are outstanding and the how-to sections make lucid dreaming very much possible for everyone. I suggest reading the book before sleeping and with an open mind. If getting bogged down by the steps, take a break and come back to it later. Lucid dreaming should be fun to learn, and from what I can tell, motivation and relaxation are key.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|This is a symbol-record. A symbol for a whole generation who had the best time of their life in the summer of 67. This is the soundtrack to that party. The Beatles status at that time was such that they could have done almost anything and get away with it. (They got away with the album \\"Yellow Submarine\\", which really only had new Beatlesmatirial for an EP worth.) And then there was the cover. The first foldout. Colors all around (very flippy trippy), not just on the front. The ambitious photoarrangement. The lyrics on the back was also a novelty in the rockworld. Special designed innersleeve and a paperark with figures you could cut out. And when the needle reache the center there was an evergoing mystic message. Cool man!     But what about the music itself? I would say that on \\"Sgt Peppar\\" The Beatles relaxed a little bit with their ongoing revolutionary musical progress and just presented a bunch of strong popsongs. The most inovative track is George Harrisons \\"Whitin You Whithout You\\" while John and Paul \\"just\\" demonstates how genuin great songwriters they are without taking any epochmaking steps in their creative evolution (no matter the sometimes intrigue arrangments). \\"Sgt Peppar\\" is really a haltingplace between \\"Revolver\\" and \\"The White Album\\" and not THEIR GREAT MASTERPIECE that so many (I guess those who wants to hang on to the sweet memory of the summer of love) likes to claim. I would rank \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"The White Album\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" as more important and better than \\"Sgt Peppar\\".     But anyway WHAT a haltingplace! Still a 5-star-pleasure no dout and \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" (best track) might be the perfect popsong.

B0000TB01Y|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I do somewhat enjoy WICKED. I'm just not a die-hard fan of it like so many others are. I think WICKED is a hit-and-miss musical.    HITS:  1. The plot is great which is a rarity for musicals. The behind-the-scenes look at The Wizard of Oz is handled really cleverly with dozens of twists and turns. But I won't spoil them for you if you haven't seen the show.  2. The characters are fleshed out and have excellent depth, mainly Elphaba and Glinda. To me, Elphaba alone is one of the great female figures in the American musical theater along with Mama Rose in GYPSY, Dot in SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, Margaret in THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA, and others. (These are personal picks, so don't go crazy if you don't agree.)  3. The cast on this recording is phenomenal, most notably Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth. They both define the characters of Elphaba and Glinda (it's easy to see why so many other actors portraying these roles are compared to them). Joel Grey is also a standout as the Wizard who brings a little bit of the Emcee from CABARET into this role.     MISSES:  1. The score is generally pretty weak, especially considering the talent of Stephen Schwartz. There are only 3 songs in this whole show that I think will stand the test of time: \\"No One Mourns the Wicked,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"No Good Deed.\\" They are each powerful, emotionally involving, and well-written. As for the rest of the songs, let's just say they are a disappointment. They range from either bland and generic pop (\\"Dancing Through Life,\\" \\"Happiness\\") to cringe-worthy dribble (\\"Popular,\\" \\"Wonderful,\\"). Plus, the lyrics are either overly sentimental (\\"Who can say that I've been changed for the better / Because I knew you / I have been changed for good\\") or just plain weird (\\"Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue...\\"). I guess lyricists can just make up their own words to make a simple rhyme. I don't enjoy saying this because I have great respect for Schwartz who's written fine scores for musicals like GODSPELL and PIPPIN. It's just here, he seems so concerned with trying to appeal to the younger audiences. Which brings me to my next point...  2. There are scenes (and aforementioned songs) that feel like they just came from a bad high school play, made only to appeal to younger audiences. Characters start to speak modern tween lingo (which is now becoming pretty dated) that seems inappropriate for the setting of Oz. I think it's fine to make a fantasy world into a parallel dimension to show the similarities between our world and the fantasy's like what the original novel did but it has to be a little bit more subtle.   3. It's not as daring as its original source material. The novel WICKED by Gregory Maguire was a dark, adult story that took a well-known fable and gave it a fresh, new perspective on it. I feel like the musical doesn't take many risks and wants to be strictly PG. Theater is all about taking risks. I really hope that it's not because the producers thought it would be inappropriate to bring a darker edge to the show because if so, then what are shows like RENT and SPRING AWAKENING doing on the musical stage??? (Ironically, they're better at appealing to younger audiences.)    That's pretty much all I can think of right now. Like I said, I don't hate Wicked. I just think it needed to be polished more. And I also think that it's being overhyped to death nowadays. It's starting to become the CATS of the 21st century: a show that's being advertised like crazy when in reality it's not THAT great. I will say that when WICKED does work, it works really well. When it doesn't, it kind of falls flat. I guess I can recommend the cast recording but again only for Idina, Menzel, and those 3 songs I mentioned before. But I can only say so much. Listen and decide for yourself. :)
B003WSFXKY|1.0|Any time you see those two words on a CD jacket you should know that whatever is inside is corporate board room crap. I keep telling myself I'll never buy another Santana disc, and this time I mean it. There is absolutely nothing salutary about this record. Santana has never had much of an integrity compass and he has largely been a cover band, bar band type of artist, you know, better suited opening for Elton in Las Vegas than essaying anything of merit in real music. Sure his initial records were things of wonder. Certainly the first record thru CARAVANSERAI were nothing short of inspired. And apart from MOONFLOWER, that was it. SUPERNATURAL had its merits, but it was not a great record and nothing since has been at all worth the money I have spent. Call it the triumph of hope over experience.  So, I thought, well, maybe there's something worthwhile here. There isn't. At least half the tunes here I hated when they first came out and the ones that are standout songs in their own right are not given any treatment by Santana that casts them in a new light. Even the prospect of teaming up with Yo Yo Ma falls flat. Truth be tiold, Ma slums almost as decrepitly as Santana - he'll make a record with anyone. Their take on Harrison's While My Guitar is thoroughly devoid of pathos, and India Airie's vocals cement this in the middle of the road.  Steer clear of this. In fact, even if it drives paul Reed Smith out of business, steer clear of anything with Santana or Clive Davis's name on it.

Mr. Martin is a strong writer who is not afraid to build up and tear down characters making the story unpredictable and all the more exciting. I like that he does not rely on magic as a crutch. The magic in his world is secondary to the inter-relationships between his characters. The series is sure to become a classic.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|While not a perfect film, Ridley Scott's Robin Hood is superior to most of the adventure and action films produced today, and is vastly better than the critics would have you think.  Your feelings about Russell Crowe's personal life aside, he makes a fine, if somewhat mumbly, Robin Hood, and Kate Blanchet is, as usual, marvelous as Lady Marion.  The rest of the cast is also good, so that at the core, you have engaging and interesting characters, something in short supply with modern movies.<br /><br />While taking a few liberties with Medieval history, the director nonetheless is faithful to the spirit of the times and the early proletarian versions of the Robin Hood legends.  At the same time, however, he weaves in enough of the Errol Flynn elements to satisfy fans of the romanticized Robin, all the while telling a rather new and different story than in previous incarnations.<br /><br />The pacing of this film is somewhat slower the ADHD hyperkinetic tempo of most `action' films currently in release, but IMO this is a good thing, as such films tend to be little more than non-interactive video games.  Rather, what some incorrectly criticize as dull pacing is what used to be called plot and character development.  Rest assured, there are plenty of fun, exciting, and suitably bloody, fight and action scenes, especially ones with medieval armies and horses.<br /><br />One failing is a bit of interesting but somewhat cryptic back-story inserted in Our Hero's life.  The back-story is not the problem, but it is fit into the story in a rather awkward fashion...something that could have been fixed with a bit more time in the editing room.<br /><br />While this film is fun and thrilling, it is also exciting to contemplate as political allegory.  For this is the story of a nation led to ruin by the excesses and folly of the Ruling Class, bent on foreign military conquest, committing atrocities against Muslim civilians, and geometrically increasing its own wealth at the expense of the workers and the poor.  Within this setting, the focus is on Working Class heroes.  Featured within this tapestry is a handsome and intelligent political leader who initially feeds the hopes of the proletariat, but then sells them out as soon his need for their support passes.  Just as 1938 saw a Robin Hood for the Depression Era, the 2010 Robin Hood is clearly meant to evoke the circumstances of our own times.poor.

8862933177|5.0|I try to crank out two three film scripts a year and after doing this diligently for the last several years, I thought I had my process of creation down pat. I'm a writer who likes routine and repeating my steps along the way to get to the end even if one story is vastly different than the other. I was a bit hesitant when I saw this product and it got to my house. I'll be honest and tell you that I even laughed a bit. At first glance I thought it was silly.<br /><br />About a month later though, I started another script and thought about my moleskin journal and started filling in the details on page one from day one. The point of something like this is twofold:<br /><br />1. It directs your pen to a specific thought when you have an idea and the object is to be specific.<br />2. Portability. Yeah, other journals are, too, but i kept remembering i had this crazy little thing and kept putting notes into it.<br /><br />Maybe it's novelty, maybe it's a fad. I don't know. But I'm getting ready to purchase my third one now as I'll be starting a new script in November. If you use it to contain and direct yourself, you'll appreciate the results.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Initially I was SO jazzed to see this book by this author pop up on my screen this morning...UNTIL I saw the price. $20 is shameful and I refuse to pay it. I love my Kindle but have seen a definate trend in the book prices once the Kindle price went down and the mass marketing took place.  Had I known this was going to happen I might have made a different decision two years ago, not purchased the Kindle and NOT recommended it so highly to everyone I knew.  Again, I am disgusted by this price, this trend and sometimes wish my Kindle WOULD 'accidentally' fall into the bathtub water.

I've read them all (with the exception of 3 weeks with my brother) - some of them more than once, and I always feel so emotionally connected to the stories.  In fact, I think this is the first book of his that hasn't made me cry like a baby.  I didn't even shed the first tear!  And the story just doesn't flow like usual....its seems choppy and forced.  And it has a certain \\"Angels Fall\\" and \\"Safe Harbour\\" type feel to it (both of which I've read recently)....this story has been done.

0316044938|5.0|What awaits us when we die?<br /><br />This is the question that has inspired religion and litterally plagued mankind since he became capable of realizing his own mortality (in this later regard, the earliest signs of human burial reveal evidences of ritual practices showing that people believed in the afterlife).<br /><br />Before this review is out, I will answer this question but first, let's look at Alice Sebold's answer:<br /><br />For tween Susie Salman (like the fish), heaven was the high school she would never attend, a residence with all her creature comforts and a ring side view to the lives of those left behind.<br /><br />In that regard, Sebold's afterlife is much more informed by movies like Ghost and theatre like Our Town than more traditional sources like say, Milton or Dante.<br /><br />And that should be fine because in their day the traditional sources were themselves revolutionary and departure from what those who'd gone before had believed (or maybe hoped or feared) to be the case.<br /><br />In this wonderful book, Sebold claims for herself and us the ability to have a heaven of our own choosing where the obvious loss of those we love is only somewhat salved by the considerable amenities God has at his disposal to offer us by way of compensation.<br /><br />By reading other reviews, it would seem that other reviewers have taken issue with a decision by Sebold to allow her teen to return to Earth only for the purposes of consumating a crush with a childhood suitor. While I find this concern beside the point I can't help but observe that the fact she was even allowed to return seemed to me to be more dictated by the narrative arc (just as I think was the manner of her death itself) than by any genuine attempt to follow the story where it would really go.<br /><br />And therefore, where do we really go?<br /><br />While I certainly concede the perogative of others to determine this question for themselves, I can't help but notice the lack of any genuine proof of any bonafide contacts with the spirit world.<br /><br />And while therefore I feel constrained to admit that I can't say much about the afterlife, this last fact does allow me one obvious observation:<br /><br />If they're not communicating with us, it's either because they don't want to...or they can't.<br /><br />For that reason I personally find that door between life and death all the more fixed and all the more final.<br /><br />Having said all that, I know I like Alice Sebold's answer better than mine. It's because I think you will too that I highly recommend this book.nuine proof of any bonafide contacts with the spirit world.<br /><br />And while therefore I feel constrained to admit that I can't say much about the afterlife, this last fact does allow me one obvious observation:<br /><br />If they're not communicating with us, it's either because they don't want to...or they can't.<br /><br />For that reason I personally find that door between life and death all the more fixed and all the more final.<br /><br />Having said all that, I know I like Alice Sebold's answer better than mine.

0307454541|1.0|As an English professor at a credible private college, I find this \\"international bestseller\\" to be one of the worst books I have ever read.  Page after page of the book is a litany of tainted  members of a pathetically dysfunctional, dark and sinister family, and is tediously Boroque in detail.  Plundering through the  multi-generational family tree was, for this reader, tantamount to going to the Mormon archives looking for a cockroach.  Where was the editor?<br /><br /> No further comments needed.  Apparently I am of limited  range and intelligence because I found this book monotonous and without any redemptive value with perhaps,the exception of the eccentric central character.  I am surprised at the popularity of this writer, but then I am frequently the rogue reviewer. Perhaps I should rent the movie or stick to minimalist genre.

0393072231|5.0|One of the things the global finical recession taught me was that I knew practically nothing about money. My economic vocabulary consisted of: profit, taxes, and bankruptcy. So when half (or more) of the Wall Street giants fell over in 2008, I understood what had happened, but the why and the how of it eluded me.<br /><br />So is the Big Short, a good resource for the financial noob? Short answer: Yes. From time to time there was jargon I didn't grasp, numbers I didn't know how to judge and name dropping that was wasted on me. But in the end I found myself with a much firmer grasp of what led to the global meltdown, and what exactly Wall Street is/was.<br /><br />Lewis adds just enough human component to The Big Short to keep us drawn into the narrative, rather than just bogging the book down in factual information. While I imagine reading about the worst thing to happen to our collective check books since credit cards were invented, is quite glum, I think there are some glimmers of hope in the book, if at least from understanding the monster of economics, rather than being terrorized by a beast of unknown proportions

B003YOMNCM|5.0|I don't have much to say about the rest of the recording, my preference was for the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto and that is what I will review on. I did already have a favorite version of the Tchaikovsky concerto but I am a Hilary Hahn fan and knew she would add to the pleasure and enjoyment of this concerto, and I am not disappointed. Hilary comes through with fresh life breathed into these passages. Hilary's closeness in performance with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra is a complete unison of respect for the music. This recording deserves the highest marks. I will be seeing Ms Hahn in performance of this work tonight and I'm thankful to have this CD in advance to review in anticipation of seeing her perform it live.

They didn't digitally correct any of the color errors (that is, spots in the movie where the film has color damage--it's really obvious after Max drags himself back to the car). The color is richer than on the DVD; skin tones look accurate, but the clouds look pinkish. And it's grainy, but still clearer than ever. You can actually read the graffiti on the high-fatality road sign, and read all the port rules on the beach sign. It's going to be a treasure trove for costumers and prop makers! The BD is definitely an improvement over the DVD in terms of clarity, but the price of that clarity seems to be all the visual noise that's now visible. (In many of the scenes where open blue sky is the backdrop, the sky tends to flicker.) I checked some scenes on the DVD and the color shifting and noise are there, too--it's just not as noticeable as on the BD. I suspect it's the very same source print.<br /><br />1080p Comments:<br /><br />Before I owned the 1080p plasma, I thought that having all that additional resolution would just make the bad qualities of the transfer that much more obvious. I was wrong. Frankly, it looks pretty amazing. There was less flickering of the sky, and print damage was much less obvious. The film still appears grainy, and overall the color is somewhat dull, but it IS a 30-year-old low-budget movie--a lot of which seems to have been shot on overcast days.<br /><br />Additional Disc Comments:<br /><br />The disc menu is odd: The footage is from the movie but the sound is sourced from who-knows-where (most of it is not from the movie, and doesn't even really match the visuals). And would someone tell me why they insist on including the abominable American dub in every release? (The only redeeming feature of the American dub--aside from its comedy value--is that some engine sounds were beefed up, and the characters' voices don't get lost in the mix as they do in the original.) The default audio is the original Australian track in 5.1 DTS HD. There's also a mono mix for you traditionalists.<br /><br />The DVD included in the set is the exact same one from the [[ASIN:B00005R2IS Mad Max (Special Edition) DVD]]. (I compared them and the markings/numbers are identical.) Compared to the BD, it now looks a little washed-out. The chapter breaks appear to be the same for both discs.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />The question is, is this BD release worth the money? Well, if you're a die-hard completist or a hard-core fan like I am, the answer is yes. If you have a 1080p TV, then the answer is YES! If you're looking for the definitive Blu-ray release of Mad Max that's the best it's ever going to get, I'd say wait (or buy used). Maybe someday we'll get a loving, caring, comprehensive digital restoration by someone who doesn't care just about the sales numbers.

B0034G4OVS|4.0|Most of the other customer viewers said it all but I noticed that in this movie you couldn't really see the collage kids breath in the outdoor scenes. There is an Easter egg on the dvd version, go to Special Features, then hit the button to go to the left side of one of the actor's collar and what looks like a paw print will highlight that spot. Easter egg title....Chair 92 Easter Egg. I'd say this movie will keep your interest from the beginning to the end. It shows you what people would go through to fight for survival and the will to live. I wanted to see this movie in the theater but it never made it here where I live. So waiting for it to come on dvd well....was worth the wait. This is more of a suspenseful movie then horror and was a refreshing outlook with the story as appose to a slasher B movie.<br /><br />in a short amount of time we discover just how 3 friends become even closer then ever before.
B002XUBDZ6|5.0|This movie is amazing.  I would rank it up there with my top 20 movies.  This is not an easy feat, this list of my top movies includes the likes of \\"Commando\\", \\"Predator\\", \\"Robocop\\", \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Rambo 1, 2, 3\\", and \\"Blood Sport\\"... as you can see, this list isnt easy to crack.  I wish i was ben richards.

B002VECM6S|5.0|\\"The Blind Side\\" is just as good as everyone says it is. It's a heartwarming dramedy based on a true story about a homeless African American teenager (Quinton Aaron) who is taken in by a wealthy white woman (Sandra Bullock) and her family. This isn't a sappy movie, but it genuinely warms your heart and makes you laugh. The entire cast is fantastic, but Aaron and Bullock are the two shining stars, and Sandy deserved that Oscar she won earlier this year. This is definitely a film that's not to be missed.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I was on board with this show before the pilot when I learned Joel McHale and Chevy Chase were cast. The show is great. The plethora of pop culture references spewed by Abed definitely make this show in addition to a great cast of well-rounded talent. This show is a great break from the tired standard sitcoms (I'm looking at you Two And A Half Men) and the copycat \\"Office\\" clones (I'm looking your way Modern Family and Parks And Recreation). If you're a fan of great comedic writing check this out.
0156030306|4.0|Flowers for Algernon is interesting although boring in some parts. It revolves around Charlie Gordon a 32 year old, mentally retarted man. Charlie undergoes a risky brain operation that can triple his I.Q of 68. After the operation Charlie is asked to take an operation with a mouse named Algernon. Algernon is a mouse who had the same operation as Charlie; Algernon is very useful to the scientist because the scientist can predict what is going to happen to Charlie through Algernon. Though the effects of the operation are slow, Charlie eventually starts seeing signs that he is progressing. Charlie has multiple internal and external conflicts, because of his emotions and feelings in this book. Some of the conflicts revolve around Miss Kinnian. Miss Kinnian is Charlie's teacher, after the operation Charlie starts growing feelings for her. Even though Charlie is considered an intellectual \\"genius\\" he still shows sign of an emotional retard, causing him to have multiple conflicts with Miss. Kinnian. The major conflict Charlie has is with himself. Algernon starts showing signs of detoriation causing the scientist to think the same is happening to Charlie. Soon after Charlie also starts showing signs of detoriation, causing him to have major internal conflicts with himself. In the end Algernon dies, and Charlie completely regresses. This book in my opinion was a very good book with only a few parts that I didn't like, I would recommend it any day.

B0030Y11QK|5.0|I didn't know what to expect about this movie, but the moment I saw who was staring and directing it I understood why I loved it. Romain Duris and Cedric Klapisch, the director of L'Auberge Espagnole. This couple is indeed THE formula for a great French film. Of course the screenplay has to be interesting but these two always hit it off.     I don't want to spoil the film but I just want to say that filming in Paris, during winter, the storyline, the actors and the different stories within created a this piece of true cinema. The director didn't focus on Paris solely, his intention was not to turn the film into an informercial, having lived in Paris myself, I truly felt inside the movie, it is truly French cinema but not only French but Parisian cinema.    I had to buy the Bluray version. So, if you haven't watched it, do it you won't regret it.
B0020NH94A|5.0|Everyone who has a loved one suffereing from brain injury (stroke, alzheiner's, trauma, parkinson's  etc.  ) will find this a heart opening mind expanding and perhaps practical and useful account of the inner awareness of a stroke victim from the moment of onset to the attainment of a major recovery goal.  In the genre of \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" and the \\"Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" this book reminds us that stroke victims and others deemed to be unaware by medical professionals  most likely do have continuing awareness and an ongoing spiritual and intellectual life.  But this offers more than that beacuse she describes a process where her recovery of specific knowledge and function elements involved first an awareness that it used to exist, then a persistent \\"search\\" for it in the attic of her brain and sometimes a complete and almost instantaneous recovery of it when she found the \\"right door\\".  For example, well along in her recovery she suddenly realizes she has \\"lost\\" color when her mother reminds her that it's helpful to sort the pieces of a puzzle by color.  (And color returned).  This account also underscores the contiuing essential importance of loved one's as companions and as partners in healing.  In this book her remarkable mother is Jill's very essential partner in a recovery that might nver have happened had she relied only on what is offerede as current practice by medical institutions and practitioners.  Her mother's role is a testament to the power of mindful presence and self emptying, selfless love. Buy the hardcover because this is a book you will want to keep and share..buy a copy for your local library.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|I haven't played the video game, so I'm down only with the bare bones of the story. What I do know is that PRINCE OF PERSIA works as a sweeping fantasy adventure, and I couldn't peel away my eyeballs off the screen. This picture rivals THE MUMMY and THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchises in terms of the lavish scope and fantastical derring-do and that nostalgic callback to those pulp serial films. I basically enjoyed the crap out of it. Never mind that these Persians tend to speak with Brit accents, and that there isn't really a Persian (Iranian) actor who garners a noticeable part. It's cool. I'm shallow.<br /><br />The hero is Dastan, the gutsy orphan boy from the streets of Nasaf who gets adopted into the Persian royal family, but the meat of the story happens fifteen years later. The MacGuffin of the thing is a mystical dagger which can reverse time for the span of one minute (or less). When the Persian army invades the Holy City of Alamut - on suspicion that Alamut is amassing secret weapons - Dastan stumbles onto the dagger and so gains the attention of Alamut's beautiful, wily Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton). Tamina is the last in a long line of guardians to the dagger. Her sacred vow to the gods would go a ways into driving this film.<br /><br />I remember when Ben Kingsley was good, but it's been ages since GANDHI, ages since even WITHOUT A CLUE. His recent stuff, with quality in mind, falls more along the lines of BLOODRAYNE and THE LOVE GURU. You see Ben Kingsley parading around in black eye makeup, and I don't think you need a SPOILER alert to suss out that his character is a knave of the most vile-hearted persuasion. When Prince Dastan is framed for a shocking murder, he flees for his life and he ends up taking the captive, combative Princess Tamina with him. And if you own one whit of movie-watching acumen, then it quickly dawns on you that this is the ideal platform for one of them lively, bickering romances. Sue me, I'm a sucker for a love story. And have you seen Gemma Arterton? Things palpitate when she's on screen.<br /><br />Not having seen much (or any) of Jake Gyllenhaal's films, I wasn't sure what to make of his being cast as the film's action hero. Thru some form of cultural osmosis, I've gathered that Jake is more the sort to dabble in indie cinema rather than be caught dead in a summer blockbuster. But not so. Jake Gyllenhaal, along with the good acting chops, is credible as the swashbuckling Prince Dastan. He buffs up for this one and brings a surprising physicality that's pretty dang Burt Lancasteresque.<br /><br />David Belle - who stars in the awesome DISTRICT B13 films - comes in as the picture's parkour coordinator, because our Dastan is this period piece practitioner of parkour. But parkour is only one element making up the spectacular action sequences and f/x. You cannot front on the production values. The CG is seamless. The sets and costumes are breathtaking and imaginative. The score is rousing. The sinister, black-clad \\"Hassansins\\" are properly menacing. Alfred Molina makes the most of his showy role as a desert bandit/tax evader. All of these elements - and the two beautiful leads - work to transport you to an enchanted desert realm where sand may invade your private bits but it's compensated for by deadly magic and wondrous, panoramic peril and Gemma Arterton's belly button. And have I told you about the Ngbaka?<br /><br />What I have is the single DVD version, and it contains \\"An Unseen World,\\" which is the Making Of the film featurette (00:15:51 minutes long). There are also two extraneous \\"special features\\" that have nothing to do with the movie, so I'll skip mentioning them. Go see the movie.nd have you seen Gemma Arterton?

B000O8OTNC|2.0|This product was bought for a backpacking trip which it will still be going on however, it is not by any means a way to get a blade more then somewhat sharp. Anyone who uses a knife as an everyday tool knows that a sharp blade means ease of use as well as less danger in use. If you want a product for serious sharpening go for a stone system such as an Arkansas stone or the like which actually can be gotten inexpensively right on amazon.com as well. I also dislike how the ceramic honing seems to work or actually not work more precisely, I feel like I need to put quite a bit of pressure on the blade to get it to sharpen and honestly it doesn't sharpen very much. All in all for a quick field sharpen up that will only last for a short time this will do an okay job.
1558908846|1.0|First, I give the film itself a 4 star rating because I liked it.... BUT...  As another reviewer stated (which I noticed after I bought the DVD), the packaging is not labeled correctly! They lied. The label says \\"ENHANCED FOR 16x9 TELEVISIONS\\",it is not. It's instead the low rez letterboxed 4x3 format.  I'm one of the few who actually seem to care about such things, but I have unfortunately bought several movies of this type and have been scammed (\\"The Rocketeer\\" and \\"2010, Odyssey 2\\" and \\"True Lies\\" among others)... and because you have to open the disc and play it to find out, you can get no refund from the store. These people should be forced to either replace the disc with what they advertized or give your money back. But they don't. They get away with lying to you. Typical Hollywood.
B003TML0VO|3.0|Has there ever been a more divisive type of record than the \\"covers album\\"? These collections usually produce two groups: The side that takes it for what it is and focuses on how well the features artists perform, and the purists who scoff at the very idea of someone other than the original artist performing the featured material. Guitar legend Carlos Santana jumps into the covers storm with \\"Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics Of All Time,\\" an album that will fool many because it has a terribly inappropriate title, the idea that \\"Photograph\\" or \\"Bang A Gong\\" are considered to be part of THE greatest guitar jams of all time is pretty laughable. But the album isn't complete trash either, there is some strong playing here, some original cuts and Santana's masterful axe skills shine even in the weaker tracks.     \\"Guitar Heaven\\" continues the trend that gave Santana his monstrous comeback in 1999 with \\"Supernatural,\\" the Woodstock icon provides the licks while a parade of superstar guests provide the vocals. The album opens with a roar in the form of Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" featuring Soundgarden's Chris Cornell channeling Robert Plant. This was almost inevitable considering Cornell's range has been compared to Plant for years now and he fits well. Santana himself masterfully keeps the original Jimmy Page feel alive but filtered through his own style of picking. \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is done in the same vein, Santana and his tight band resurrect the Rolling Stones with a driving funk feel while Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland interprets the words with a gritty edge.     Rob Thomas, who made Santana famous to a whole new generation a decade ago with the smash hit \\"Smooth,\\" reunites here with Carlos to cover Cream's immortal \\"Sunshine Of Your Love.\\" While the instrumentals are exhilarating and Santana's guitar sounds like pure fun, Thomas feels a little out of place, maybe we're just too used to Clapton's milkier vocals. One of the best tracks here is \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" featuring India Arie and cellist Yo Yo Ma. The cover is done with a gorgeous atmosphere, a classic song with 21st century oxygen.     \\"Back In Black\\" with NAS is a rap version of AC/DC that might attract the open minded, certainly it will repel the purists. The Doors' \\"Riders On The Storm\\" is done with an eye towards keeping the original's ghostly mood intact, Doors organist Ray Manzarek provides some moody background, Santana's notes are psychedelic and delicate, but the downer here are the vocals by Linkin Park's Chester Bennington. Bennington is simply not a great singer, his voice sounds like a monotone computer voice reading off text. Jim Morrison is gone, but certainly someone with a deeper range could have been brought in, but of course we must remember that this is a commercial product after all.    \\"Smoke On The Water\\" with Jacoby Shaddix is a surprisingly strong, heavy number while \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" is a good, faithful rendering. The rest feels like cheap filler, especially \\"Dance The Night Away\\" with Train's Pat Monahan which is just standard, empty pop and \\"Bang A Gong\\" with the once well-known Gavin Rossdale of the long extinct grunge act Bush is no better.     If you want to hear Santana and his tight, impressive band interpret some classics, than this album is worth checking out, purists who hate the very idea of covers should just stay away. This isn't a masterpiece, but it still beats the latest from Katy Perry and this is the first Santana album of new material that features the entire band, particularly stellar drummer Dennis Chambers, on every track. A great album to blast while driving with the windows rolled down on a sunny California afternoon, except of course, for the mentioned weak tracks you should just skip. This isn't \\"Supernatural\\" or even \\"Shaman,\\" but it's never boring.
B003XWEQ1G|2.0|I thought i was going to see an epic film, but this fell really short of expectations.  Poor acting in places and honestly, it could have been better.  Despite notoriously good directors, I feel this was produced and directed poorly.  Epic failure with sporadic scenes of interest and entertainment.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|Tension fills this 2 hour plus film notwithstanding that there's not much real action in this classic western starring John Wayne and Dean Martin. The film was directed by Howard Hawks, but if someone told you that it was really directed by Alfred Hitchcock you might, after watching this film, say hmmm that's interesting; in short, you might half believe it.  It's a character study of several book-ended by a dramatic opening confrontation and a rousing concluding showdown.  It's hard not to compare this film with \\"High Noon\\" because that film too seems to to be a spring that is continually coiled until everything is unleashed at its end, but nobody is really particularly likable in \\"High Noon\\" and while the tension builds one doesn't really come to like more and more the players herein as one might in \\"Rio Bravo.\\"  The tension continues in \\"Rio Bravo\\" but you never have the feeling that an hour glass is generating it which inclines one, I believe, to not so much as look forward to its conclusion as enjoy each minute of the film and, to some extent, not welcome the moment when the film begins to wrap things up for you. It's theatrical in the sense that it is just plain good theater and the characters, albeit on a screen and not on stage in front of you, are just enjoyable to watch as you grow to like and respect more and more of them over the course of this ensemble performance. It's a film, moreover, that one can watch over and over which bespeaks that this is one fine film.
B003L1ZWG2|3.0|Ok, so I watched it last night and from my experience, I liked it. Here is why. I have 20yrs Navy Medicine experience (taking care of my Marines). Field Medicine training, Emergency Medicine and Cold Weather training had me watching it from a perspective of someone who would think of these things first.<br />Now, after reading some negative reviews, they have some valid points but I suggest you rent first and decide if you want to buy.<br />1 - 3 people are on a ski slope and no cellphones? Did I miss something? LOL<br />2 - Wolves may be pack animals but they would not go out of their way to attempt to outsmart 3 humans and then lose interest in the female after taking down the males? Sexist wolves is what one reviewer said. I laughed but he was right.<br />3 - Yeah, these kids are STUPID. Case closed.<br />  I cringed at the broken leg from the first person dropping/jumping. I perished the thought of what a wolf could do if it ever DID attack while I was down. Not a likely thing to happen but nothing is impossible. (Sort of a SPOILER) I cringed again when the person gets hit by a falling cart while trying to escape.<br />As I said, it's worth the rent as long as you know some of the story's low points and can let them slide.

1439102813|4.0|I read this book for a book club. It was a tough read as my Grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimers in her early 60's and eventually passed away due to it. It was insightful as to what she probably experienced. While it broke my heart reliving the memories of watching her so confused, I also felt like it gave me a window into her heart. This was just such a beautifully written book with such great characters and a wonderful story line that it made the heart wrenching plot bearable.

0307454541|4.0|Being the fan of thrillers that I am, I don't know why I kept putting off reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson.  It has spent week after week on the New York Times Bestseller List, mostly at number one. Last week I finished reading it and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />PLOT SUMMARY:<br />Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired by Henrik Vanger to investigate the disappearance of Vanger's great-niece Harriet. Henrik suspects that someone in his family, the powerful Vanger clan, murdered Harriet over forty years ago.<br /><br />Starting his investigation, Mikael realizes that Harriet's disappearance is not a single event, but rather linked to a series of gruesome murders in the past. He now crosses paths with Lisbeth Salander, a young computer hacker, an asocial punk and most importantly, a young woman driven by her vindictiveness.<br /><br />Together they form an unlikely couple as they dive deeper into the violent past of the secretive Vanger family.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo turned out to be a phenomenal thriller that really did keep me glued to the pages.  Larsson's characters are amazing and force you to sympathize with them almost from the opening pages.  Lisbeth Salander will probably go down as one of the greatest fictional characters conceived as you find yourself almost wanting to protect her but learn that she doesn't really need help nor would she ask for it.<br /><br />The plot and its stunning conclusion didn't disappoint as well.  The twists, turns, and discoveries will have you dropping your jaw and turning the page at a breakneck pace.<br /><br />The largest drawback I'd say the novel has is its length.  It takes about 100 pages of back story and superfluous details before you really get into the heart of the story.  The other negative is trying to follow the family members of the Vanger family.  At times you feel like you need their family tree charted to keep up.<br /><br />A word of caution; there are some very graphic and disturbing scenes in this book so it is not for the faint of heart.  However, if you're like me and tend to gravitate towards the graphic and disturbing in stories, then I highly recommend The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />[...]so it is not for the faint of heart.

B003TVMIDO|4.0|The John Lennon Signature Box Set is a beautiful collection celebrating Lennon's 70th Birthday. Overseen by Yoko One Lennon, this collection contains eight original studio albums digitally remastered by the same team who remastered The Beatles stereo and mono box sets of 2009. Included is a 60 page hard book with photos and text. Also included is a nice essay pamphlet by Yoko, Julian and Sean. It's a really nice collection and worthy of any Lennon fan! Note: not included in this set is the new Double Fantasy Stripped Down release!<br /><br />As for the sound of the discs, this is where the box set starts to fail. Gone are the remixed and remastered versions from the 2000-2004 releases of the same albums. Replaced are John's original audio mixes. Purists will rejoice but in my honest opinion, the results are historic but dated. Having listened to the discs in this edition as well as the 2000-2004 remixes, I have to say this set pales in comparison. Rock `N' Roll, in particular, sounds very bad and made me long for the remixed version.<br /><br />While I do applaud Yoko and team for this wonderful collection, it would have been nice to include the remixed versions as well as the Double Fantasy Stripped Down release. I've listened to it and it is a really interesting release. While this box set is flawed, I do encourage you buy it! If you own the 2000-2004 mixes, live albums and unfinished works, you're pretty much set on your JL collection with this and the new Double Fantasy Stripped Down release!

B0037QGS0A|4.0|A chance meeting sets some things into motion - one of those being the testing of a husband's faith. See, a married man misses a flight home, missing his surprise party in the process. This makes his wife wonder what he was up to, and a text with a picture of a young girl makes her wonder even more. solution: in the bathroom, on a night out, the wife meets a girl named Chloe. She seems nice enough and claims to be clean and that sets the wife's mind into motion. she decides to take Chloes and get her to tempt her husband. The problem is that she doesn't know Chloe or know anything about what she wants at all, making things turn out to be - complex and then some.    When I sat down to watch Chloe, I thought I had already seen a million movies like it. The cheating husband and the not-so-blind wife, the person hired to bring it all into focus, and then the drama. The problem was that this is not the story at all - it only seems to be.    I personally liked the cast to this movie and, honestly, I thought the twist with excellent. I cannot talk about it much, but can say with certainty that I really didn't see it all coming. There were a few parts i thought I knew and a few i could have guessed, but this movie was complex because humans are complex. It also talks about so many things that we forget; sometimes there can be purity in so many things, emotions in even the toughest seeming rock, and when we forget that we sometimes forget pieces of who we want to be.    If you have yet to see this movie, you shouldn't wait. It is good and it is interesting and it can surprise you. I watched with singularity in my focus, not knowing, and the end paid me back for that. I personally laughed when i noticed how wrong I was, too, and thought \\"I am soo glad I caught this.\\" Watch it and see what I mean - you will be drawn into it all when you see the thing in action.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|$19.99 for an e-book?  Charging more than the hardback?  This is crazy marketing strategy for the publisher and a tragedy for the author and the reader.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|BOTN kicks ass!!!!What a great metal album.It has the classic Accept sound with a new singer Mark Tornillo.I love his voice and he has a great metal scream,outstanding job.I am so glad they got back together and made this incredible album.This is the type of album I wanted Maiden to make in the last 10 years but they never did.Maiden are more on the progressive route.Accept know what the fans love and they delivered with this album.Anyone who likes metal or some of Accept`s past music will love this album.Congrats to Accept for making this album.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I am going to take a page out of the book of kindle users who reviewed this book based on price.  One person said he paid   $400 for the kindle.  I laugh at anyone who runs out and buys a gadget as soon as it hits the shelf.  And now you want to complain about the price of the ebook?  What's $19.99 when you have $400 to blow? I am giving this 5 stars to negate at least one if the 1 star reviews.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|I think Most Harry Potter fans will enjoy this collection.  Extended version makes you feel like you're getting every morsel of (to me) the most endearing of the HP films because it's the first one when Harry, Hermione & Ron were at their cutest and most innocent.  For non book readers, it's the wondrous first introduction to the magical world of Hogwarts after all.  The rest of the bonus features are satisfyingly interesting, informative & entertaining although the self-guided tours are sort of lame & I'm not sure what I'll do w/ all the extra versions (in addn to the extended version, comes w/ the reg theatrical release plus a digital copy).  The rest of the bonus featurettes, although not as elaborate as the ones Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings, are still worth the few extra bucks if you're a fan of movie 'extras' of your favorite flicks.  I don't think I'll admit to owning the trading cards (LOL) but they ARE very nice - super heavy & larger than baseball trading cards.  The photo book is actually quite beautiful.  If the box/case weren't so nice (has an elegant magnetic closure) it would make a nice mini coffee table book.  At less than $20, I found this collection enjoyable enough to want to continue on to the Ultimate Collection as the prices go down.  I just ordered #2 (Chamber) at $19.48 incl shpg.  But the prices will no doubt go lower if you can wait another several months and don't mind continuing to watch the TV reruns for now when they have Harry Potter weekends.
B003V6L94Q|2.0|I was so looking forward to this album- The Foundation is one of my top albums.  Part of the reason I loved TF so much was because for the most part, it was a \\"smart\\" album- really emotional songs (not necessarily sad emotion, but some emotion- fun on Toes, tear-terking-ness on Highway 20 Ride, foot-stomping action on Where the Boat Leaves From, etc.)    Sadly, the new album came out and I was so disappointed.  All of the songs either lacked emotion or were just very hickish and stupid (lots of yelling, etc. or just plain gross (why do you have to put in a line about \\"Lick my sack?\\")).  I don't like redneck country, though, so if you like that, you might like it.    The only song that I really liked was \\"Colder Weather,\\" but it still wasn't the emotional powerhouse that I was expecting to follow up \\"Free\\" and \\"Highway 20 Ride.\\"  I would stronly reccomend LISTENING TO THE WHOLE ALBUM before you buy, so you won't spend twelve bucks on something you don't like.
0316098337|4.0|The premise of this book is very interesting, and written from the point of view of a five year old boy.  His insights are at times funny, clever, or sad.  I really liked it but couldn't rank it right up there with my all time favorites, at five stars, but I definitely recommend it.  It is an easy read, but filled with concepts to contemplate.
0439023513|5.0|I could not put this book down.  This is the third book in a series, The Hunger Games.  The author gives us a glimps at a possible alternate world just like our own, where government control is taken to the next level.  It's scary to think that this could be our possible future.  Would we be willing to do whatever it takes to survive?  What sacrifices we would we endure? What extent we would we be willing to go to in order to take care of the people we love? What if we had to make a choice between our families and friends? If it came down to our survival or theirs, what choice would we make?  The writer of this series was wonderful.  I felt like I was there with the characters going through everything with them.  I wasn't sure about reading the first book, because I hadn't heard anything about it.  A friend suggested it and I can't thank them enough.  It is one of the best series of books that I had the pleasure of reading. I highly suggest this book and series.

1594202559|5.0|Sebastian Mallaby, the Paul Volcker Senior Fellow in International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Washington Post columnist, has written a most illuminating book on hedge funds.<br /><br />The top three hedge-fund managers in the USA get $1 billion each a year. The money comes from fees (often a fifth of the profits), short selling and leveraging bets with borrowed money. Then they apply the whole package to bonds, futures, swaps and options. Mallaby calls it a `carnival of creativity and greed'<br /><br />Hedge funds claim that they make the market work. They believe the myths that the markets are always right, that they correct themselves, that the chaos after the credit crunch could only happen once every billion years. They base their models on assumptions of `rational expectations' and `efficient markets'.<br /><br />But the efficient-market theory crashed with the 1987 crash, the bond market meltdown of 1994, the Long-Term Capital Management bust in 1998 and the crisis that started in 2008. Currency markets, like equity markets, do not tend towards an efficient equilibrium. As Keynes said of those gambling on bubbles, \\"the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\\"<br /><br />In reality, hedge funds are not about making markets more efficient or prices more accurate. They are all about seizing profits from other people's wealth-creation. They are parasites.<br /><br />Michael Steinhardt, for example, made his fortune by milking discounts offered by pension funds and mutual funds. His collusion with brokers harmed the funds, which would have got better prices for their stock if insiders hadn't fixed the market. So the losers were millions of ordinary Americans, the winners were the millionaires who invested with Steinhardt.<br /><br />Britain's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (1990-92) gave speculators an opening. The Major government spent $27 billion of reserves trying to save the overvalued pound. After we left the ERM, the pound fell 14 per cent, losing the taxpayers $3.8 billion. The great philanthropist George Soros got $1 billion, in a `vast transfer of wealth from taxpayers to traders'.<br /><br />In 1997, the hedge funds caused Asia's financial crisis. Soros' fund sold the overvalued Thai baht short. His fund made $750 million from the forced devaluation; Thailand's output fell by 17 per cent, plunging millions into poverty. Then Soros told South Korea it must `restructure' by making it easier for employers to sack workers.<br /><br />As Mallaby sums up, \\"During the crises of 1997, hedge funds had profited by betting against governments that set illogically high prices for their currencies. In the hangover from those crises, hedge funds would profit by betting against governments that set illogically low prices for the broken jewels of their economies.\\"`<br /><br />Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs boasted of their independence from governments, yet when in trouble in 2008 begged for government funds. The International Monetary Fund said the bailouts cost the taxpayer $10 trillion.<br /><br />Future crises are bound to happen. As Mallaby writes, \\"When banks can pocket the upside while spreading the cost of their failures, failure is almost certain.\\"<br /><br />As he notes, \\"government insurance encourages financiers to take larger risks; and larger risks force governments to increase the insurance. It is a vicious cycle\\", which, he warns, \\"will go on until governments are bankrupt.\\"g the taxpayers $3.8 billion.

B000JPIB8Y|5.0|This is a beautifully written book. I lost my son 2 1/2 years ago and this helped to soothe my aching heart.
B002SF9YUM|4.0|Pure Indie film ! A must for anyone who loves Rob Pattinson. Nice to see his acting abilities outside of twilight.
B00005JKC3|5.0|In the film the hulk Dr.bruce banner(eric bana)tranforms into a powerfull muscular green giant with superhuman size,strength and power and superhuman speed.The hulk has phenomenal size and strength .At 15ft.tall, he is as big as a dinosaur.The story is about the power to defend yourself against bullies and evil monsters,especially when threatened by them.Also the supernatural ability to grow bigger and stronger.In the comic books the Hulk is more powerfull than in the movies.He can take the core temperatures of the sun(hot as hell!),he can survive nuclear explosions and planetary impacts.He can grow tissues for breathing underwater and stay in space for extended periods of time,he can leap across continents and jump into the orbit of the earth.Dr.bruce banner has incredible brain power and the hulk has incredible muscle power.The hulk`s origins in the movie are very interesting about his genius mad scientist father david banner(paul kersey as the young david banner)in the desert at the army base trying to do research on strengthening the immune system,cellular regeneration(including muscle cell regeneration) and achieving biological immortality and then experimenting on himself and creating a genetic alteration(altered his D.N.A.) in his body and his son`s body.David banner(nick nolte)says he wanted to \\"improve on nature and make it a 1,000,000 times more powerfull\\".David banner was a good scientist who wanted to help mankind,but became an evil scientist who wanted to use this new technology for himself. David banner told his son Bruce banner, \\"everything that extraordinary mind of yours has been searching for is me\\".<br /><br /> Then ThunderBolt Ross(sam elliot)shuts his research down.The Hulk has a good origin story,but Spiderman and IRONMAN had better origin stories  and were more fun and exciting.They could have made the HULK better if they didn`t waste time on dull and boring drama scenes and had more action and adventure.In the Berkeley science lab Dr. bruce banner(eric bana) and his beautifull assistant Betty Ross(jennifer connelly)are experimenting with nanomeds and the bodies ability to regenerate, repair and rebuild itself and to heal itself from injury or disease,then an accident exposes Dr. bruce banner to gamma radiation that awakens the cells in his body that unleashes the awesome power that transforms him into the hulk when he gets angry.The genetic alteration that bruce banner`s father  passed on to him makes his body strong enough to survive and protects him from the nanomed accelerated healing and growth technology that killed all the lab animals and the genetic alteration also protects him from the gamma radiation from killing him.The genetic alteration + nanomed reconstruction technology + gamma radiation = bruce banner transforming into the HULK. The special effects are superb and extraordinary,the CGI Hulk is mindblowing,the music is great and very enjoyable and beautifull,the visuals and the hulk fighting the giant monster dogs and the army is breathtaking and incredibly exciting and when his father david banner(nick nolte)transforms into the REAL ABSORBING MAN and flies through the air at lightnening speed with the HULK.I like the part when bruce banner tells talbott, \\" talbott your making me angry,you don`t like me ,when I am angry\\".The 15ft. Hulk is so huge and powerfull nothing in this natural world can kill him. Bruce banner`s traumatic past and troubled childhood make him a victim more than a hero and destroys his love life with his girlfriend betty ross.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|Im not really a James Blunt fan.. heard a few songs and liked them but still wasnt sold just yet. came across this CD at my local Dollar Tree (yeah, I know) and love it. kinda melanchony but all in all sentimental and touching. I really like it :)
0765326353|4.0|Writing (and reading)epic fantasy series is different from other books. Other types of fiction are done at 400 page. Epic fantasy is just getting started.     The world and story that is set up in this novel is beautiful. Once you get through the book it's clear that the vision Sanderson has for the series is amazing. A must for people who love the genre or sanderson's other works.     The one flaw is that it takes time to get going. I wouldn't say it only picked up in the last 200 pages. I got hooked at about page 500. Up to that point there are 3 story lines, and in the first 1/2 of the book only one really had me (Kaladin).     I did read almost the last 250 pages in one night, staying up to 3:30 because I couldn't put the book down.     The other reason this book is only 4 out of 5...it's just not up their as one of my personal favorites...not like The Eye of the World, a Storm of Swords, or Mistborn.     Yes, I did like Mistborn more than this. With Mistborn it was easier to be more engrossed in the world. The world of Way of Kings is  more mysterious...there is just more that hasn't been revealed. Also, Mistborn was much more focused on one character, Vin. The only character in Way of Kings that is so deep and likable is Kaladin. There is just a lot more Vin in Mistborn than Kaladin in Way of Kings (not to say there is not a lot about kaladin...I'm speaking comparatively).     Shallan is a character of huge potential. But it took much of the book to build her up. I can't wait for the next book and read more about her...but in this book it feels like she was starting from ground zero...being created. She had a complete arc, but the arc left her off finally at the point where she's someone to really care about. (but it was the same with some of the wheel of time characters...especially Mat, and even to an extent Lan). It's just the nature of these epic fantasy stories.     Anyway...I hope my review doesn't sound too negative. It's not one of my absolute favoritefantasy books, but I did like it a lot, and was totally engrossed by the end.     What I do like about this as a first book for such a long series is...Sanderson seems to have excellent sense of problems authors run into when writing these things. I really think this series is just going to keep getting better.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Don't get me wrong this is a great double cd. However it is missing \\"Have a cigar\\" and \\"Hey You\\". I noticed that right off the bat! Other than that it was a great purchase.
B0044430H8|5.0|Reznor & Ross have outdone themselves with this score. One of the best electronic movie scores ever composed. Upbeat, dramatic, somber, all the bases are covered. I rarely download movie scores but as soon as I left the theater I was like I have to own that music!
B000JLPMPS|5.0|Calling this film a \\"revisionist\\" western does it a disservice in my opinion. Yes, it is darker and more honest about the violence that existed in the West, but it retains classic elements and wonderful performances that put it in the company of films like \\"The Searchers\\", \\"Red River\\" and \\"Once Upon A Time In The West.\\"
B0010X745K|1.0|I usually enjoy a good horror flick. For instance, I can watch Jaws over and over, constantly being surprised when the music stops and the shark jumps at the sheriff. I even liked the movie The Descent where I was creeped-out not with the underground monsters but with the confining nature of being stuck in an underground cave. However, I cannot say the same for Darabont's The Mist.     To end the movie in this way, something somewhere needed to foreshadow its goal. However, the movie's hero did not suffer from hubris or a sense of depression. The hero's son did not suffer from a horrible or painful illness or disease. The other minor characters in the car did not suffer from signs of mental instability. But what I did suffer from when I watched this movie's end was an acute case of an adolescent-man-child giving up hope. In fact, most of what was in the movie directly drives the audience away from this movie's conclusion. The characters left the supermarket to leave hopelessness and insanity behind.     To call the movie's ending ironic would be to slightly suggest that the movie was better than it was. In reality, the ending was just a cruel and horrible trick played by an adolescent filmmaker.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|On his latest release, Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards, Joe Satriani sets a really comfortable mood and gives un hour of outstanding music. Again. In an era when the shuffle setting on the IPOD is king, and the art of true album making is a seemingly dying art, Satch brings us back to where rock and roll belongs. It's his strongest effort in years - and I liked Super Collosal and Professor Satchafunkilus!  Maybe that long overdue Grammy will come his way. But what makes Joe and his fans great is that he doesn't care, and they don't either. This is an amazing record, one that deserves a lot of listens. Grab a good pair of headphones and settle in to listen all the way through. One of the reasons album making is dying is because we have lost the art of album listening. Give this one the attention it deserves!      Premonition - A fitting title for the opening song on a truly dynamic rock and roll album. It's familiar, yet fresh, offering a hint of the new tracks to come. The tolling bells and footsteps at the start, the building melody with the keyboards layed gently over the top, then a blistering bridge to the solo. This song - like the record - goes lots of different places.    Dream Song - A perfect choice for BSAWW's second cut. Starts with a nice, echoey Hendrix-like riff, a cool keybord rhythm - then some of Joe's patented tones and melodies. Satch says this song came to him in its entirety in a dream, thus the title. I wonder if he was dreaming about Crystal Planet? Dream Song has the feel of something from side two of that masterpiece.    Pyrrhic Victoria - From the opening notes, you know the album is really hitting it's stride. The rhythm section lays down a killer groove, while Joe gets absolutely filthy on the fretboard. Big, loud, funky and a rager of a solo.  Make sure you have a good pair of headphones; you don't want to miss this song's wonderful rhythm guitar chops. We all love the solos, but Joe's wide open rhythm work on his solo records is a realtreat, too. I love this song. It's in rotation on my radio station starting, like, right now.    Light Year's Away - This was the album's advance track, and was a good one to draw attention to the new release. It's got a great swing and a great vibe. This song - and several others on the album - give me the distinct impression that Satch was re-energized by the Chickenfoot experience. This has that big 80's arena sound that rock music has been missing for the last 20 years.    Solitude - Just when you think you've got BSAWW pegged, here comes a pretty little bridge piece to take us in a new direction, for a stroll down...    Littleworth Lane - One of the things that really sets Satriani apart from other guitarists is his ability to \\"play it pretty for the world\\" while still getting his chops in. This is a nice gospel-tinged piece that will have you humming along, but not singing the blues. Good stuff.    The Golden Room - Like Andalusia, Asik Veysel, Belly Dancer, Morrocan Sunset - Joe takes an eastern style, plays with it, blends with a good dose of his own style - and comes up with a song that really swings. Jeff Campitelli's percussion work is wonderful on this track. He ties it all together very nicely.    Two Sides To Every Story - I like this song. Mike Keneally gets it started with a tasty keyboard melody, and Joe follows with some juicy, understated blues riffs. The solo isn't a shredder, but it fits the song perfectly. He really lets the rest of his band shine and do their thing on this track. It's probably a testament to the overall strength of the album that Two Sides comes off as a weaker song at first listen. But don't give up on it. Listen a couple times and let it grow on you.    Wormhole Wizards - When I first saw the tracklist and the album title, I had a feeling that the title cut would be something very special and memorable. I wasn't wrong. (Call it a Premonition?)  Wormhole Wizards is as fine a song as Joe has recorded. Ever. On every listen, Ihear something new and awesome. That rhythm work I referenced earlier is amazing on this cut, as is the keyboard groove that Mike Keneally lays down. Joe has a lot to express in this song, and uses every one of the six minutes and twenty seven seconds to express it. Listening to this for the 4th or 5th time, it occured to me that this song is what the Engines of Creation CD might sound like if he re-did it today. Very, very impressive piece of music.    Wind In The Trees - This song would fit nicely with Clouds Race Across The Sky from Engines of Creation. It has that feel. But this song is far superior. Timing out at 7:42, it's the longest song on BSAWW, but it doesn't drag. There's some extended jam and solo work in here that sounds very much like a one-off in the studio. There's an  extended run at the end where Joe and his Ibanez guitars fade way into the background and let Mike Keneally take the lead. It's a very jazzy, moody piece that fits the rest of this album very well.     God Is Crying - The title suggests a power ballad, but it's clear from the first couple of notes that Satch has something else in mind. The song builds up to a really heavy groove, then settles into a distortion and pedal-heavy song. If God IS crying (and a look around the world indicates He certainly should be), then this track suggests that He sheds tears much differently than you and I.    Heartbeats - The first of two bonus tracks - available either at Best Buy or on Napster. They're both good tracks, but neither is of the standout variety like Ghosts was on the last CD. I'm glad he included them here, but am also happy he didn't leave any of the other 11 cuts out!  Heartbeats has a feel that's much more consistent with his last couple of releases. The tones on this song are really sweet. I hear a little Clapton in there, a little Jimi, even a little Carlos at times. But mostly it's just Joe.    Longing - My favorite of the two bonus tracks. I'm reminded of Bono singing \\"all I've got is this red guitar, three chords and the truth\\". It's a very simple three chord song with some really blistering solo work. I want to hear this one live.
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|If you like JJ Cale you will probably be happy with this CD.  Clapton may be a big Cale fan, but he should at least be true to his own style instead of trying to reinvent himself as one of his idols.  This would be great elevator music, but I would certainly prefer a little of the Clapton energy of old.  This one will be collecting a lot of dust on the shelf.

B002XMGGK6|5.0|This film was so riveting and shows how the justice system in this country really is as \\"unfair\\" and \\"manipulative\\" and what the character that Gerard Butler played so brilliantly was so necessary for the rest of us to see.<br /><br />Another example of how one man can \\"make a difference\\" and changed Jamie Foxx's character totally around and made him into a \\"new and better man.\\"<br /><br />I loved this movie so much that the instant I saw it I had to own it.  I can watch it anytime that I want and enjoy it everytime.<br /><br />Great acting, super exciting, kudos and accolades to whomever created this movie.<br /><br />This film is one of my very favorites and reaches in and touches that part of me that knows the existing way that the court system is today, is not justice at all, and we get to experience and \\"get\\" that given the opportunity and experience what Gerard's character had to go through, we could do the same exact thing to make the criminals of the world see that there are a whole lot of people \\"out here\\" that if we had the chance and had the skills we would see to it that the criminals need to suffer the same way that their victims suffer.<br /><br />The criminals of this magnitude never get to suffer the same way that their victims suffer at their vile and sick ways and in this film we get to vicariously get to have our revenge \\"button\\" satisfied. Great way to avenge a wrong doing.<br /><br />Another \\"A\\" list movie.
B003OHSFR6|5.0|After seeing a story on TV about \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" book and film I decided to see if the book was available on Amazon. Before searching Amazon, I didn't realize it was a trilogy. I purchased all three books in paperbook and even though they were shipped from England, I received them promptly and in good condition. I was hooked by page 10 and couldn't believe the number of twists and turns in the story. It kept me glued until the last word. I couldn't wait to begin reading \\"The Girl That Played with Fire\\". This book was another heart-pumping page-turner that kept me guessing until the very end. I am now about two-thirds through the final book \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" and even though the loose-ends are all coming together, you just never know what is going to happen next. You just can't predict any of what is going on. I recommend these books to anyone who loves crime thrillers. Heck, I would recommend these books to anyone who loves to read. They are definitely worthy of all the hype that has been given to them.

386607607X|5.0|Every time I read Watchmen, I'm completely blown away. My first experience with it was a few years before the movie came out, and after finishing it (with superficial understanding) in the span of two days, I truly I believed it was the greatest comic book I'd ever read. A second reading a few months before the movie came out still kept it in that top spot.<br /><br />Before reading it a third time recently, I was afraid that the movie had skewed my view. I was afraid that the amazing visuals and bad acting (the film's glaring flaw) would make me see the characters in a less-realistic tone, with the exact dialogue bringing my mind back to how it was butchered on screen. And my predicted fears came true, but only for the first two issues. By the third, I fell headfirst into Watchmen's universe, feeling like I did the previous times I read it. With the hundreds of comics I've read and reread since my last reading of Watchmen, I've still ascertained that Watchmen is the greatest comic book ever produced. Watchmen is filled with so much philosophy, symbolism, and character development, that no comic book has ever reached it's level of completeness. Every single panel is packed full of meaning.<br /><br />I wouldn't tell everyone, \\"if you ever read a comic book, read Watchmen.\\" It's hard for a person who doesn't regularly read (comics or literature) to digest. The book is so dense that only half of those I lent it to finished it.  But, if you do read comics or books, and you haven't read Watchmen, you're missing out on the biggest thing to happen since the Lost Generation writers of the 1920s and 30s.<br /><br />writing: [10/10]<br />art: [9/10]
B000WGWQG8|3.0|It's always been a mystery to me why there are thousands of movies about World War II, but only a handful (can you think of more than six?) on the American Revolution, despite the fact that our revolution was in many ways a more dramatic event, and one whose outcome has changed every country on earth. So it's very refreshing to see a serious and well-funded attempt like this one. The period color, costumes, sets, and backgrounds are all first-rate (though in too many cases the clothing doesn't really look lived in), and the historical research seems at least well-intentioned, if not quite as exhaustive as it might have been. There are some odd choices, however. For example, the battles at Concord and Lexington are not depicted, only their aftermath. I can't imagine why the filmmakers would choose not to include that. It can't be a budgetary decision; those battles are re-enacted every year in painstaking detail in Concord and Lexington, entirely by volunteers. (And while still on the subject of clothing, many of those volunteers have their costumes made by the same companies in England that made the originals, and every last button is authentic. I'm guessing that the filmmakers did not go to those lengths.) That battle was, of course, the pivotal moment in the whole story, and to leave it out and deal with it only in passing is inexplicable.<br /><br />Even more inexplicable is the choice to cast Paul Giamatti as John Adams. I can't think of any actor who would have been lower on my list of options for that role. Giammati is a likable enough actor in the right role. He excels at playing indecisive, shuffling losers, and in those roles we warm to him, because it seems like he's at home there, and we identify with those qualities in ourselves. But this role calls for someone morally unequivocal, intellectually indomitable, and utterly forceful. Adams was reluctant to be a rebel because he was so rational and had such faith in the law's principles, but Giamatti plays him as uncertain, which is a very different thing. He also plays Adams with lots of gushy emotion, almost like an Italian opera character, where Adams' actions and writings indicate a man who was intense in his beliefs, rather than in touch with his feelings. Again, a world of difference. In almost every scene Giamatti hits exactly the wrong note, like a tap-dancing monk. And since the whole story turns on his character, it brings the entire production down. It's really too bad, because it will probably be a long while before we get another serious attempt to address this topic. In the meantime, if you're interested in this subject, let me suggest that you visit Concord on Patriot's Day this April, and see what it was really about--especially if you think the Tea Party yahoos have even a faint clue about their inspiration.

It most definitely is not for the faint of heart.  I often wonder if September 11 was chosen due to the fact 911 is the national emergency call number.  Perhaps I missed this on the TV, however if anyone has heard of this please repond to this post.  Thank you.

B003XX2PPO|3.0|I am the last one to say something negative about Luis Miguel. I've listened this CD several times, trying to figure what went correct, what went wrong, if it's the artists fault or not. And there is a reason for this: Complices, for example, does stand out as being a much more rewarding album.      The BEST material of the CD are the ballads. I wish the whole record would have been Manzanero's ballads. They fit his voice perfectly. The strings are good. However, the pieces are too short, and one gets the feel like they just end when you are getting into the mood. In fact, there are not many pieces in this record that would go above the duration of 3 minutes. For a ballad that is not really much.    The lighter pieces of the disc, the material didn't attract me that much. Not catchy enough, not melodic enough. But is that the singer's fault? - I don't think so. Luis Miguel lifts this material up as much as possible, and nobody else could have done such a job. The pointing finger here goes to those who didn't provide him what he would have deserved. Perhaps he had the 'best men' around, but this time they were not worth the money.       I believe in this album Luis Miguel didn't quite get what he had asked for and what he had wanted. Possibly for this reason he wished not to give a name for this album. Yes, this album actually doesn't have a name! Without Manzanero's touch this album would have been in danger.     The expectations are already on the next release. This one will not keep us 'chewing' for a too long time.      Helsinki, Finland.

B003EYVXSW|5.0|I offer up this explanation to those who have not yet seen SPLICE and are confused by mixed reviews. There are no spoilers, so confidently read on:    SPLICE has something that most horror/sci-fi movies lack: wit. In order to fully appreciate this movie you have to understand wit. It's not a stupid movie, it's a movie that is smarter than the average movie goer. Yes, the characters make nearly every wrong decision possible, and many of the scenes are humorous, but INTENTIONALLY so! The story is tongue-and-cheek and the actors, screenwriters, and director are in on it, but the audience, for whatever reason, has largely misinterpreted this movie as a serious drama that is played terribly wrong and is unintentionally funny. There are dramatic elements and serious parts, but the bizarre scenarios, in which the dramatic dialogue occurs, create surreal and humorous situations. Again, it's purposefully and intelligently humorous, i.e. witty.    SPLICE is a bizarre movie. It takes a twisted sense of humor to truly appreciate it. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley deliver deadpan performances, providing very analytical and matter-of-fact responses to outlandish and grotesque scenarios. They make every wrong decision possible, because -frankly- if they were to follow the ethical code of conduct for genetic engineers this movie would be 10 minutes long. It's not a realistic portrayal, but a cautionary fantasy. The only way this story can be told is humorously, and -despite what the majority says on internet chat rooms- it works!    I apologize if I sound defensive or condescending, but SPLICE is one of my favorite movies and it's been greatly misinterpreted, degraded, and disregarded. I think its mainstream release is partially to blame and it would have done better in limited run with word of mouth (i.e. Human Centipede). It's just not for everyone, and I am confident that this movie will reach cult status among a weird demographic. I joined the official SPLICE Facebook page and most of the comments have been about how terrible it is! WHAT??? It's supposed to be a fan club! I don't understand...
B001992NW4|5.0|I want to start off by saying that this is the best Blu Ray release I have purchased to date. The packaging is wonderful with it's hardcover \\"keepsake\\" aesthetic, and the additional bonus features alone make it worth the meager asking price. Seeing actual footage of Linda Blair (in full makeup no less) on the set is priceless and definitely trumps any extras from the previous releases.     On to the important stuff....THE MOVIE.    I have to say that this has become my favorite film of all time. I am by no means a horror buff. I have a few faves of the genre..but I opt more for the comedic and/or fantastical. I like to either be uplifted with laughter, or taken away from reality entirely.     You ask \\"Then why on EARTH would you consider The Exorcist your favorite movie??\\".    Simple. It is a modern parable and is one of those rare films that truly produces it's intended effect in every frame.     Labeling \\"The Exorcist\\" as a horror film is a bit short-sighted. It's a spiritual drama, psychological thriller, and supernatural tale...all rolled into one.     37 years later, it still holds it's own and is as relevant today as it was then. The difference here is that we now live in a society that is, as Blatty states in the Fear Of God documentary \\"utterly jaded and depraved\\". Nothing here seems to shock and 14 year olds now see this film as \\"laughable\\". It's a shame, because there is a great deal more than pea soup and spinning heads here. It's really all about the terror of the unknown...the fear and trepidation involved in all things metaphysical and spiritual. It's about the mystery of faith and it's capacity to ultimately triumph.     The sights, the sounds, and the story...all mesh here. It's incredibly well written by Blatty. Friedkin's sense of documentary-like realism serves the plot well. The acting is top notch by a cast that could not have been more perfect. Dick Smith's makeup is ground breaking, not only with Linda Blair, but with Max Von Sydow who was inhis mid-to-late forties at the time. Owen Roizman's use of varying light textures and, of course, his masterful and iconic shot of Merrin's arrival, is noteworthy as well.     I was fortunate enough to see the Fathom screening on Sept. 30th and, while seeing this film on a big screen with digital sound was fantastic, I still have to say it plays better and provides more unnerving sensations when watching at home...in the dark. That is the truly frightening angle within this film...it reminds us that no matter how safe we think we are (even in our own home with all the lights on), there is nothing that true evil will not do and nowhere it won't go to manifest itself.

0140135154|3.0|Ways of Seeing is a small book (Penguin, 1972) of a 1972 BBC blockbuster TV series. The series was a follow up to and, in part, a reaction to Kenneth Clark's earlier, pioneering Civilisation series of 1969.<br /><br />The book is poorly illustrated, but the TV series is lavish and very `visual'.<br /><br />Berger's thesis is an early example of post-modern criticism - i.e., he `deconstructs' naive assumptions about visual communications (photography, advertising etc), but it is marred by many unsupported assertions and personal, emotive, psychological `arguments'.<br /><br />The script of the series was written quite quickly and, actually, with little revision, Berger has admitted.  And it was screened late at night because the BBC was not sure how it would be received or who would be its audience.  Few realized in 1972 where advertising was going (we know now!).<br /><br />Berger's thesis actually makes only four simple points.  He makes them by visual means rather than words, but he often overstates them (the analogy with advertising itself is striking!).  Many of them are things we are all aware of now (or at least we should be! However, it may be that they are so omnipresent now that we do not notice.).<br /><br />Berger's four points:<br /><br />1.  (Chapter 1) Photography has changed the way we look at the world - and at art.  This thesis Berger derives from Benjamin (who was of the age-group that witnessed the change). But he somewhat over-states the case.<br /><br />It is a fact that the history of popular visual culture began with the invention of photography in 1839.  Photography is the ultimate derivation from the detached, proto-scientific attitude of the painters of the Italian Renaissance - Masaccio, Leonardo da Vinci et al - who analysed vision and representation through the `laws' of perspective.<br /><br />And the camera is a machine that makes it possible for everyone - not only artists - to record and represent what they see.  (Of course, since the 19th century art has had other aims than representing reality visually, although this still persists.)<br /><br />2.  (Chapter 3) The nude in art is a woman and a commodity made available to a male owner.  Actually, however, this is not always true.  Michelangelo's slave sculptures and David are visual metaphors for human struggle, dignity, independence and virtue.<br /><br />To understand Berger's discussion, we need to realize that pictures of naked people (not only attractive women) - nudes - are a form of art (see Kenneth Clark's The Nude (1955)).  Whereas some nudes in art are intended to titillate, most are not.<br /><br />3.  (Chapter 5)  The possession of a painting of something is akin to possessing the thing represented.  The period 1500-1900 was the era of capitalism.  Oil paintings serve the need of capitalists to have valuable possessions and - thus - to celebrate their wealth.  Only oil paintings can have material value.  Watercolours can only have spiritual value, as in William Blake's work.  (This, too, is a highly specious argument.)<br /><br />History painting reinforces noble values (and so do `low-life' genre paintings - by implication, presumably).  `Not so much an open window [a phrase used commonly to describe Renaissance paintings, especially landscape views from an interior] as an open safe' (p.109).  This, too, is a non-argument.  It ignores sculpture, for example, and other items of demonstrable capitalist wealth - stamps, antiques, land.  It is true that history paintings portrayed the conservative values of the establishment (see David's Oath of the Horatii), but they were also those of the church, royalty and the nobility as well as capitalists.<br /><br />4.  (Chapter 7)  Publicity (advertising) photographs are an extension of history painting (the representation of noble subjects), except that they aim to stimulate purchasing.  This point relies on the former, i.e., that possessing a painting of a thing is akin to possessing the thing itself, and is far from established.  It is true that photography in advertising (and, more recently, on TV) aims to stimulate an impulse to purchase the things illustrated, but it is a leap of logic to try to connect this with history painting.<br /><br />Like Walter Benjamin's 1936 essay, `The Work of Art in an Age of Mechanical Reproduction' - on which Ways of Seeing is based - this is an over-enthusiastic Marxist reaction to `admass' culture.  In the 1970s, intellectuals were just beginning to make a serious study of advertising, entertainment and mass culture (what has now become `cultural studies').<br /><br />It is an entertaining - if somewhat flawed - read.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1609764161 What Art Is - and Isn't: An Aesthetic Tract]]recently, on TV) aims to stimulate an impulse to purchase the things illustrated, but it is a leap of logic to try to connect this with history painting.

0553805371|5.0|Wow. This is a mind-bender but a great way to keep your brain and mind healthy. The basic idea of the authors is that if there is experimental support for M-Theory then we may have found the grand design of the universe. The extent to which any one person may understand the illustrations of the argument is another question. For example check this out: \\"bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can\\" (p. 180). Yikes! But when you read (and re-read) their arguments it gets clearer and the clarity is a great reward when it comes.<br /><br />After giving a concise summary of model-dependent realism the Hawking and Mlodinow make the point that all concepts of \\"reality\\" depend on pictures or theories (models). They then discuss the attributes of a successful model. Is it elegant? Does it contain few arbitrary or adjustable elements? Can it make detailed predictions about future observations that can falsify the model if they are not borne out? Hence, weaving history, mythology, theology and philosophy they walk us through the way humans have and currently do make sense of the world then introduce us to some of the pictures or models that cosmologists are using to understand the nature and origin of the universe.<br /><br />Their point is that \\"M\\" Theory, will function as their model and they offer a colloquial jaunt through general and special relativity, sting theory, quantum superposition and Richard Feynman's infamous \\"sum over histories.\\" In tracing the origins of the universe Hawking and Mlodinow point out that such a search must take place \\"top-down,\\" starting at present and examining things like cosmic microwave background radiation to understand what came before and when before began. The idea that time is a malleable property of this universe (yes there may be lots of universes with different laws than ours) is one of the brain-bending ideas that the reader meets. In addition, you get to learn about the 11 dimensions of the universe that \\"M\\" Theory suggests (the four of space-time and seven additional ones that are curled up infinitely small but that play important roles in the physical laws we observe at the Newtonian and quantum levels). The authors end a fun and complicated romp with the notion that if the predictions of \\"M\\" theory are borne out, we may have found a set of theories (M-Theory is a set of theories including 5 string theories) the grand design of a universe that could come into being from nothing and not require any creator per se.<br /><br />I doubt that the avowed theist will find \\"The Grand Design\\" much of an argument to stop their tithing but hopefully it will initiate us laypeople into the mysteries of what can be examined with scientific methods. The little I think I grasped of this work and Hawking's other books has only increased my awe and wonder at why there is something rather than nothing. The extent to which anything inspires a quest for knowledge and a sense of awe perhaps it is a living mythology in itself. And if that is the case perhaps it is irrelevant whether the journey leads us through a church or a physics lab.<br /><br />As a postscript - I think I got more out of this because I'd read \\"The Illustrated Brief History of Time\\" and \\"The Universe in a Nutshell\\" first.erse that \\"M\\" Theory suggests (the four of space-time and seven additional ones that are curled up infinitely small but that play important roles in the physical laws we observe at the Newtonian and quantum levels).

B001MSMULG|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, the protagonist is Gabriel who is retired from the Mossad and now restores old art. He is pressed back into service to take out an old nemesis, Tariq. They have each killed relatives of the other so \\"this time it's personal.\\" Gabriel presses into service a French/Jewish supermodel to go under cover with him. Another reviewer commented on the believability of that development, so I won't dwell on it here. The majority of the story takes place in Paris, although the climax takes place in America. There is sex and violence in the story (it is a spy novel, after all) but I'd say it's PG-13 by modern standards.    Much of the plot is highly derivative (personal as well as political antipathy of the protagonist and the antagonist, use of a gorgeous supermodel as an undercover assistant). The ending is also not very believable, IMHO. Many people seem to like the characters, but I found most of them to be pretty flat and two-dimensional. Stock characters, really. I don't think there is any character development. The protagonist starts out world-weary and alienated, and ends up pretty much the same. Ditto for the supporting characters, too.    But I did enjoy the book and could not put it down as I read the last third or so. I enjoyed reading it, but as I think about it afterward, the flaws (as I see them) stand out more than they did at the time. Kind of like sleeping with someone and really enjoying it at the time, but seeing it differently the next day.
B000B63IEI|5.0|A musician could give us the best album the world has ever seen, and there would still be those who would attempt to tear it down.  This explains the negative reviews of this CD.  Leif Ove Andsnes and the Berlin Philharmonic are in top form here--I have a tough time seeing where the negative reviewers are coming from.<br /><br />The Rachmaninov First Concerto has a youthful quality to it while still sounding surprisingly mature.  Written when Rachmaninov was still in his teens, it already contains the passion and melancholy that is so characteristic of Rachmaninov. We hear intimate playing coming from both Andsnes and Berlin throughout.  The music sounds fresh from the pen.  Instead of focusing on the outward qualities, Andsnes and Berlin go straight to the heart.  The finale is especially satisfying here.  The roof-raising theme is interpreted in a way that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The Second Concerto is, of course, much more familiar, and rightly so.  Some reviewers will want to tell you that Andsnes and Berlin disappoint here.  Don't be having any of it.  Here Andsnes and Berlin pull out almost all of the potential music.  Rather than resorting to hysteria, Andsnes and Berlin give us inward music that brings tears to the eyes.  Andsnes' playing is flawless technically, which enables him to pull out wonderful detail.  And Berlin accompanies him marvelously, engaging in wonderful chamber-type conversation with him.  In the opening movement, we hear a strong contrast between the poetic, reflective moments, and the climaxes.  The second movement is unbelievably good.  I have heard several performances of this unforgettable movement, but never have I heard a performance half this satisfying.  Andsnes gently pulls the beauty out of every note.  Emmanuel Pahud's solo on the flute at the opening is worth the price of the whole disc.  And Pappano leads Berlin in a wonderful accompaniment.  The music is made to speak for itself but still speaks in a outstanding way.  This is the way it is supposed to be.  In the finale, we are instantly put on the edge of our seats.  Then we are greeted with a lovely rendition of the second, lyric theme.<br /><br />I honestly cannot possibly express my strong feelings for this CD.  With such a stunning orchestra as Berlin and such a poetic, thoughtful pianist as Andsnes, you could not possibly go wrong.  Buy it.peaks in a outstanding way.  This is the way it is supposed to be.

B000002KDG|4.0|I read the reviews and I don't know what I'm missing but if I did the desert island test, this one wouldn't even occur to me. If you like Neil Young churning and rocking, then get Year of the Horse. RNS, compared to that one, is an interesting historical artifact with the convenience of Powderfinger and 2 versions of My, My, Hey, Hey on it. YOTH, on the other hand, contains all essential songs, all done in butt-kicking fashion. I prefer the hard rocking, finger in your face of Pocahontas on Year of the Horse. The one on here puts me to sleep in comparison. I suppose if you like the groovin' vs. rockin' Neil Young then you are in the right place. IMO, he warmed up to where he got on Horse.  The reason to get this: Powderfinger and those 2 versions of the MMHH song. The rest are not his best renditions nor his essential songs AND its a short album. Horse is a double CD. You do the math.<br /><br />Disclaimer: My main purpose in writing this is not to promote a desert island, truly essential CD (YOTH)(if I wanted to do that, I'd just go to that board and overhype it-nah, impossible to over anything with it) but more to reality check the ravings, I mean ratings, over here. One of the problems with these review boards is that sometimes products can get overhyped and when you listen, you are disappointed. I have the CD and the vinyl version of Rust Never Sleeps, thinking if I got it on vinyl I might like it better. Well, that's true of anything, but it really didn't make me jump around and rock out, thinking Neil Young is the MAN!, like Horse does, vinyl or no vinyl. I suppose it will have its uses, and I'll pull it out when I'm in a certain mood (quiet, sleepy). I love Neil. I am not trying to put it down. I'm just saying it ain't all that. THere's better.

0316069485|5.0|Mickey Haller is asked by the District Attorney's Office to cross the aisle and be the prosecutor in the retrial of Jason Jessup. Through use of DNA testing a key piece of evidence from the 1986 trial was thrown out and Jessup's conviction has been overturned. Jessup was convicted of abducting and killing a young girl and dumping her body.    Mickey is reluctant to take the case at first feeling that it is a losing proposition and against his nature as a defense lawyer but he is soon convinced to do it. He chooses Maggie McPherson, his ex-wife as his assistant and none other than his half-brother, Harry Bosch to be his investigator.    Connelly does a masterful job of writing, using first person when the chapters are more about Mickey, and third person when the chapters focus on Harry. This style works quite well. As the story progresses Harry calls in the services of his old girlfriend Rachel Walling, who blends into the tale quite nicely. Haller tries to use his own experience as a defender to anticipate all the moves of his opponent in court and most times is quite correct in his assumptions.    As Jessup is awaiting trial, he is allowed out and the press follows him around like he is a celebrity. This shows the ugliness of our society where vicious criminals can sometimes be admired Also people mistakenly think that if that if criminals are treated well, they will be your friend and change their ways. It is apparent that Jessup hasn't changed his ways and his nightly travels suggest that he is up to something. It is up to Mickey, Maggie and Harry to keep all their wits and work at constant overtime to make sure Jessup is taken down again before he can get his way.    The book doesn't have as much action as past Bosch/Haller individual tales, but the courtroom dialogue exchanges are great and Harry's investigative talents are at their best. I hope Mr. Connelly can come up with more creative ways going forward to keep Harry and Mickey working together!
B002TZS5GU|3.0|More like 2 3/4 stars really    The plot - It's dooms day or pretty close. For this is a contagious virus end-of-the-world-zombie-movie with no zombies.  The suspense of zombie attacks has been replaced by the danger that one might at any moment catch a pretty bad virus and die a slow excruciating death. We, for the most part, are subjected to watching the antics of four incredibly, irresponsible, stupid and cantankerous protagonists. The only suspense comes from waiting to see which one of these very deserving folks will be the next to catch the disease due to multitude of dumb actions. This is pretty much the entire film.     This a good looking film and the director Alex Pastor can tell a story (in an annoying sort of way) and he keep things moving along (in an annoying sort of way). The film really does not look bad and even has a professional look and feel for a low budget indie horror film. There is a bit of cleverness here and there. I particular liked the opening sequence where the sky does a flip from the seashore to a desert road.     The actors (although no standout performances)are not without talent - as I do not believe it is the actors' faults that they are so very annoying - I believe the actors are for the most instructed to play a bunch of irritating dopes...that are...well...irritating.  And they do it very well.    For example: the four actors are required to behave on one hand like four people who's goal is do everything they can to survive and reach a safe destination and on the other hand behave like four drunks at a New Years Eve office party.  Ahh...that is one of the many rubs. For these two behaviors are a contradiction and watching these folks act out this contradiction gets on your nerves very fast. This also creates a big plot hole as you begin realize that there is no way that these jackasses could have survived as long as they have with their ludicrous behavior and minimal safety precautions.    Now for the next problem...how to say this without spoilers.  There is an awful lot of things that make no logistical or logical sense or are completely implausible.  There is also to many contrived dangerous situations which were obviously filler in order to pad out a very thin plot.  The diving board scene for one - the breaking into a boarded up house for another.  Climb on the roof? when the flimsy wood could have been easily removed from the front door and windows. OK, you'll know it when you see it.  There is also the fact that this disease is so damn contagious but the cheapest Lowe's dust mask and little Clorox is all you need for protection. Doesn't sound so bad to me.     The final problem - while I'm at it - is the ending - this is dark pessimistic movie - so if you going to do a dark pessimistic movie - you might as well go for a pay-off with a nice dark pessimistic twisty ending.  (Check out the film Shuttle for dark pessimistic twisty ending...or maybe better not) Anyway, I was really hopping for a knock-your-sox-off dark ending but instead the film peters out blandly with one of the characters (who we don't care about) waxing nostalgic in a long over dub.      OK I said allot of negative stuff about the film (did I mention that it kind of gave me headache?)  But if you like dooms day films, with a professional look, that are sometimes clever, with a little gore, and a Dawn of the Dead feel - then Carriers is not too bad.  Carriers can't hold a candle to 28 Days or The Dawn of the Dead films or either one The Crazies films but its light years better then that ludicrous Ebola film with Dustin Hoffman. Whats it called? oh yeah, Outbreak.

B002ZG97RE|4.0|War in Iraq and its moral consequences has generated lots of Hollywood movies in the last few years.  In this one, Matt Damon plays US Army soldier who is tasked to search for weapons of mass destruction with his units of special force soldiers.  As it turns out every mission they are sent out to shows no results.  No weapons are found and all they encounter are groups of angry civilians demanding fresh water, electricity and food.<br /><br />It a typical thriller plotline we have a mix of politics, espionage, journalism, political indoctrination and patriotism.  One of the most memorable characters is a youn Iranian man, crippled by a war (he lost his leg) who has his own personal reasons to help American forces in their military action in Iraq.  Fluent in English, this young man becomes involved in the mission, more than he bargained for.<br /><br />This is a cool movie for lonely Friday nights when one feels like staying at home.  But it is not a particularly memorable one.  It is definitely a statement to American presence in that part of the world and its politics at work there.
B002BW7A58|1.0|Lil Wayne's [[ASIN:B002BW7A58 Rebirth [Deluxe Edition]]] is simply put `one of those albums that should NOT have happened.' High (no pun intended) off of the triple platinum, Grammy award winning effort [[ASIN:B001E4IY3Q Tha Carter III]],  'Rebirth' comes as promised as Lil Wayne's `rock album.' True to his word, 'Rebirth' features more rock-oriented production work and even more notably `singing' (err... autotune) from the rapper.  Kanye West tried singing (autotune) as well on 2008's [[ASIN:B001FBIPFA 808s & Heartbreak]], the difference being his effort, despite its flaws and sagging moments, works more effectively - particularly given its minimalistic production work. On Rebirth, Wayne attempts the big anthemic refrains that often characterize rock music with less avail because it just feels ill suiting that any rapper without a history of singing or dabbling in rock music would attempt to record a rock album.  In my humble opinion, given the number of date shifts for Rebirth, I believe even Wayne finds this album to be a throwaway. Sure, there are a FEW worthy cuts, but overall, this just does not highlight the talent that Lil Wayne is to hip-hop music or music in general.<br /><br />\\"American Star,\\" featuring Shanell aka SNL (whoever she is!), is not to bad, but it is not valedictory by any means either.  The production work is good and accomplishes Lil Wayne's goals of featuring rock and roll centric production, but does it really suit Wayne ultimately?  Shanell's vocals are sound here, but not even her contribution really causes the listener to `jump out of their seats with excitement.' \\"Prom Queen,\\" also featuring SNL,  is a better cut, but nothing epic.  This served as the first single for Rebirth, as well as the first sign `do not buy this album.'  The auto tune quickly grows annoying, though a decent, though not great refrain causes this cut to be one of the better ones of this questionable album.<br /><br />\\"Ground Zero\\" may possibly be the worst cut, featuring an overdrawn instrumental intro and a ridiculous performance by Lil Wayne.  Wayne's assertiveness is appreciated, but he takes everything `over-the-top' which takes away from it.  \\"Da Da Da\\" is almost as bad if not as abad, finding Wayne's vocals way over-processed with studio effects.  The gimmicks have grown cheesy by this point and some of the repetitions are just downright sad.  For a rapper with one of the greatest hip-hop IQ's in recent times, it is sad to find him resort to such rubbish as this.  \\"Paradice,\\" features nice production work, but again the woes of vocal effects and a rather lukewarm performance make this another losing cut.<br /><br />\\"Get A Life,\\" though ridiculous by all means, provides some saving grace to the album, though do not look for a remake of \\"A Milli\\" by any means.  \\"On Fire\\" is even stronger, rivaling `B' cuts that could appear on any of his truly `hip-hop' affairs.  Why \\"On Fire\\" works better is because the production leans the slightest bit more `hip-hop' than `rock,' despite some rock over- and undertones.  \\"Drop The World,\\" featuring Eminem is the album's best cut and the saving grace that helped Rebirth be certified gold.  The production work on this cut is epic, Wayne actually sounds inspired, and Eminem's verse is sick.  Maybe he should have saved \\"Drop The World\\" for [[ASIN:B00437DYLI I Am Not A Human Being]] or Tha Carter IV!<br /><br />\\"Runnin,\\" featuring SNL once more returns back to more rock-centric production work and kills the slight bit of momentum aroused by \\"Get A Life,\\" \\"On Fire,\\" and \\"Drop the World.\\"  SNL's vocals are too manic for my tastes, given the fact that Wayne does little to build up a grand crescendo to SNL's massive, anthemic refrain.  \\"One Way Trip,\\" featuring humdrum rocker Kevin Rudolf underachieves as well, with the sole redeeming factor being Travis Barker's drumming.  Nicki Minaj does not even come close to saving \\"Knockout,\\" an utterly ridiculous cut filled with more overindulgence via vocal processing.  On the standard edition, \\"The Price Is Wrong,\\" an uptempo ditty, closes the album - on a sour note.  The Deluxe edition, adds  \\"I'll Die For You,\\" and \\"I'm So Over You\\" - do not waste your money.<br /><br />Disappointed? No, because I had faith that this album would be absolutely ridiculous in the first place.  I just wanted to hear HOW BAD this album would be.  It has more uninspired moments than redeeming ones, unfortunately.  Fortunately for Wayne, his new EP, 'I Am Not A Human Being,' is nothing but \\"fire\\" and his upcoming The Carter IV should wow hip-hop lovers everywhere. As for this effort, I would NOT waste my time or money and if you do, opt for the standard edition.ard edition, \\"The Price Is Wrong,\\" an uptempo ditty, closes the album - on a sour note.

B001UV4XUG|5.0|I loved this film that is so cute and honest in its storytelling and background music.  It is a love story about two young people who find their way in a big city from a small town.  They are young and bright eyed but also seriously under-employed.  Young man is an architect who happens to work in a greeting card company, composing designs and text for the Hallmark like card.  A young woman, pretty and free spirited is employed as assistant in the same place.    Story is told in non-linear fashion and it mingles the start of their love affair as well as the end of it and a hartbreak of a young man.   The story is told from his point of view and it is peppered by beautiful music (of the anti-establishment kind, i.e. \\"Smiths\\") and deep, raw emotion.    I find film to be honest and sincere and for that reason, I really liked the story. My take is that this is one of the better romantic movies ever and it fits every generation.

0307346617|3.0|This book is predicated upon showing the human element during the world's war effort against the undead. It's something specifically stated at the very beginning of the novel. Why this book fails is because it is a novel trying to accomplish a retelling of the war through stories, which, functionally-speaking, works quite well. \\"I'm sold\\" on the idea, so to speak. Regarding this supposed \\"human element,\\" yes, I realize we're getting a myriad of stories from various people from around the globe, but this sort of works against itself when the quality vs. quantity phenomena is in effect.<br /><br />What we have are hundreds of stories giving their personal experience of World War Z, ranging from the very beginning stages, to The Great Panic, to Turning the Tide, and beyond. However, because we're constantly shifting prospective, countries, and placement in political and social standing, we, as readers, never become invested in any of these \\"characters.\\" There's also the added degree of difficulty the author sets for himself by having so many different locales, and therefore, cultural shifts throughout the book. I thought this would be a demand that author would rise to in order to create authenticity. Brooks, however, ignores country and continent. There is never a language barrier or a scent of broken English. The general in Japan sounds exactly the same as the Russian nurse and they sound just like the American corporal. It's lazy writing, and blatantly so.<br /><br />Had Brooks spent half as much time on the cultural traits as he had the military jargon, he'd have a much better end product. At least this way, I'd have felt like I'd seen the world instead of simply told \\"this is [insert foreign country] but I'm going to Americanize it for you.\\"<br /><br />World War Z gets it's main point across: the war. I know what happened, how it happened, and how it ended. The problem is how that information was given to me, this sort of convoluted round-robin of interviews and stories. Brooks lets each of these interviews go on with very little interruption from the guy with the tape recorder, and with each of them being a crap shoot of good or not good or great or flat-out boring, the pacing can really mess with you knowing it's ups and downs for 300+ pages.<br /><br />This is the kind of novel that gives you the big picture through a series of pictures, and when you're finally done, you might feel as if some of those photos could have been deleted. They either didn't add to the story or served as a way of relaying military info that the author didn't have the good sense to cut.<br /><br />To anyone who has read this, I ask: How much better could this novel had been with the same story, and around six or seven MAIN characters?<br /><br />Bottom line: a great idea that truly sells me on the idea of waging war against the undead, however, the execution of \\"the human element\\" is DOA.of these interviews go on with very little interruption from the guy with the tape recorder, and with each of them being a crap shoot of good or not good or great or flat-out boring, the pacing can really mess with you knowing it's ups and downs for 300+ pages.

0525951652|5.0|For all of you out there who have an issue with the price of this book it brings up an interesting debate, but not one suitable for a book review so I will give it 5 stars to negate at least one bad review.    What do you consider a fair value of a Kindle book, $10?  So, if the book is 50 pages or 1,000 pages $10 is the acceptable price?  Or, do you feel that the content of the book and the size of the book should change the price?    I honestly don't have an answer so if I feel a book is worth reading and I don't have an issue with paying $20 I will pay $20.  However, for someone to say that I am hurting the ebook community by paying that price I find ridiculous.  Face it, the ebook community thanks to Kindle and the iPad are here to stay and with competition there will be some price adjustment but for the most part those big guys control the price.  If you could get a worldwide ban on all ebooks above a certain price than maybe you could get somewhere but you can't and you won't so if you feel like not paying $20 because you feel it is overpriced, fine, but don't throw venom at me if I choose to pay $20 for a book.    20 years ago I would have had no option and had to buy the hardcover for $36 if I wanted it right away and I am sure people back then were saying don't buy any books over $20 or wait for them to be on paperback, looks like the hardcover industry is still here...

B002VJ0576|4.0|I can best sum this movie up as the Holmesian equivalent of Sharktopus.<br /><br />If that sentence makes you shudder, for heaven's sake, go watch some Jeremy Brett, because Holmes purists will last about ten minutes before becoming very, very shouty. If it makes you perk up a little and say, \\"Oh yeah?\\" then read on.<br /><br />Everything that can be wrong with a movie is wrong here. The budget is so low that Holmes and Watson get one suit each, and the whole thing appears to have been filmed on the grounds of a large dairy farm. Holmes canon is taken out back early on and shot, like Old Yeller, and it's not a clean kill. I would, in fact, bet money that the screenwriter has never read a Conan Doyle story. There's a dwarf rubber prostitute-eating T-Rex. There's a rubber Kraken -- heck, maybe it is Sharktopus, the lighting's not that great -- that surely cost more to construct than it earns from robbing ships. Did I mention the rubber Kraken robs ships? The rubber Kraken robs ships. I'm still not sure what the T-Rex is for. The historical details are weirdly, hilariously wrong -- London's East End, for example, appears to be both subterranean and lit by masses of candles, like a Sting video. Holmes is teeny and Watson is tall, and their Baker Street digs are within walking distance of a scary forest. There is a climactic aerial battle between a mechanical dragon, piloted by Holmes' evil brother Victorian Iron Man, and a heli-balloon. And Gareth David-Lloyd gives a good performance.<br /><br />After 15 or 20 minutes, the whole thing becomes so improbable, wrong, and bad that it turns entertaining, and even endearing. I watched it at a big girls' slumber party, and we went from dead silence to delighted incredulity to rolling with laughter. (\\"It's terrible,\\" said one friend, \\"but it doesn't hate life.\\") I suspect a little alcohol might improve the viewing experience even more, but alas, we're all lightweights. I also suspect we'll watch it again.

6305252572|4.0|I've always been a fan of Eddie Murphy and especially [[ASIN:B0029OMEYK Beverly Hills Cop]]. When I heard there was a movie done beforehand in a similar style I just had to watch it.<br /><br />Although it is gritty and raw, with some amazing dialogue, I wouldn't say it was up there with BHC. It has some savage villains and a genuine on-screen chemistry between Nolte & Murphy.<br /><br />It also seems to be one of those classic 'bad cop' films where the police are sharp-witted, swearing New Yorkers, but this film seems to have gotten in there before such things became cliche.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth a watch, although I happened to catch [[ASIN:B00004D0BQ Die Hard [1989]]] after watching it and noticed that the 80's definitely provided many better cop movies. Can't be too bad if they made a sequel though...

B003RNXIBK|5.0|I've just been listening to this album, and this is just to say that all the (positive) comments and reviews are true - this album really is Eminem back on top form. But it's not like his previous album's in having skits and similar themes running through it (e.g. his mom, illegal chemicals and mocking celebrities).<br /><br />This album is something bold, new and innovative, almost like it's been done by a completely different rapper - so altered is the material.<br />And the best thing about this reinvention is that it is raw and rough - tracks like [[ASIN:B003T0TUC2 Going Through Changes ]] and [[ASIN:B003T0VWTQ Cold Wind Blows]] are unlikely to be singles, but are there to add texture to the album.<br /><br />Some have said it is as good as [[ASIN:B00006690G The Eminem Show]] and I'd partly agree (to emphasise how good it is compared to the last two albums).<br />However, I don't think it is quite as vivid and attention-grabbing as his peak and I'd say it was more comparable with [[ASIN:B001KH68GM Invaders Must Die]] or [[ASIN:0552774294 The God Delusion]] in being ground-breaking work, but not quite on the level of their peerless work in their youth.

1416594795|4.0|Richard Dawkins has written a number of books, and most of those have been on the subject of evolution and its irrefutable reality.  So with the release of The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution, readers - whether they are fans of Dawkins or not - may think: \\"What?  Another book on evolution?  Haven't you said everything you've needed to say?\\"  But The Greatest Show on Earth is different; unlike most of Dawkins books that seek to teach and educate.  In this book, there is less of Dawkins revealing the absurdity of creationists and other fundamental religious groups seeking to cry out again the \\"theory\\" of evolution with the \\"truth\\" that the Earth is only four thousand years old (though there is certainly some, just less), Dawkins lets the facts and reality of nature, life, and the evidence speak for itself.    The book doesn't employ a chronological, evolutionary history of life on the planet, but seeks more to reveal the linkages and combinations and symbiotic relationships in nature that are just there for us to see if we take the time to look and study them in detail.  Bursting with charts, illustrations, and photos, Dawkins just shows us the facts and lets the reader understand and accept, providing illustration and discussion where necessary to thoroughly convince.  Dawkins even makes the effort to link many of the chapters to personal stories and experiences in his life.    The Greatest Show on Earth is a book in which Dawkins puts less of himself into, as compared to his other books, but at the same time feels more of a personal work for him.  It is the triumph of nature and life in revealing its incredible complexity, development, and evolution over the billions of years that can only astound and awe readers; which is why having Dawkins along for the ride helps make the journey that much easier and more meaningful.

B0035V35P8|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />The main villain of James McTeigue's \\"Ninja Assassin\\" is an ancient secret clan known as the Ozuno that kidnaps little children for the purpose of turning them into cold-blooded killing machines, devoid of personalities, emotions and lives of their own.  These ninja are also invisible to the naked eye, making it virtually impossible for their intended victims to know when they're coming and to mount a viable defense against them before they arrive.  Raizo (South Korean pop singer Rain) is the ultimate Ninja warrior who, disillusioned with the whole killing thing, now resides in anonymity in Berlin, having long ago chosen to turn his back on the clan that raised him.  Mika (Naomie Harris) is the spunky forensic researcher who's beginning to uncover the existence of this group at great personal risk to herself and those around her.  Together, Raizo and Mika battle the evildoers, while a budding romance develops between them.<br /><br />As ninja movies go, this one is relatively well-thought-out and entertaining, mixing contemporary cloak-and-dagger espionage sequences with flashbacks to Riazo's unconventional upbringing.  In addition, this mega-bloody and ultra-violent film at least provides some internal conflict and character development to go along with its sometimes jaw-dropping and always skillfully executed martial arts sequences (the fact that Joel Silver and the Wachowski Brothers are the film's producers probably accounts for the comparatively high quality of the final product).
0765326353|3.0|I like to read books in bed before going to sleep, but this one has proved to be a bit problematic.  For one thing, it's heavy.  What else would you expect from a 1,000 page hardcover book?  The other problem is that the book isn't gripping me the way I want to be gripped by a fantasy novel.  Like Peter Brett's Warded Man books, this book shifts POVs between characters on a chapter-by-chapter basis.  Unlike Brett's work, none of Sanderson's POVs seem to have any kind of sense of humor!  This makes for a very dry read, with a lot of intricate detail included to help make the world-building seem more authentic.  Due to the lack of fun I've had while reading the book, it's become more and more of a chore for me to keep reading it.  At this point, I'm taking a break from the story because I'm feeling like I'm forcing myself to plow on simply because I've enjoyed Sanderson's other books.  I don't want to have to force myself to read anymore of the book, so I plan on picking it up again in a week or so and seeing where the story leads.  I hope the bleak world built by Sanderson to this point becomes a little more colorful, and I hope that the magic that was used in Chapter One gets explained at some point...I've read another 290 pages and not seen one hint of an explanation.<br /><br />I'll be back after I pick up the book again.

0743200799|5.0|I read almost all the astronaut books. This book was great explaining some of the ground control of Mercury through the Apollo program.<br /><br />We see  Gene Krantz becoming a fighter pilot with the Saber's. Unfortunately the Air Force wanted Krantz to fly tankers. No way. He joins NASA and is mentored by Chris Kraft. He goes up the ranks working with various people and becomes a flight controller and  then becomes \\"Flight\\" the head of the \\"white\\" crew. We see him working with telemetry members in the \\"trench\\". His wife makes him a white vest to wear on the missions with Gene at flight control.<br /><br />We see the first 4 inch launch, Al Shepard's first American in space launch and the rest of the Mercury shots. Then the Gemini and later the Apollo shots. Krantz and his white crew were in charge of the LM touching down and off the moon on Apollo 11. Krantz  helps get Apollo 13 home after an oxygen tank explodes and takes out the entire side of the service module.The astronauts are so proud of ground control helping them. Ground control receives the Medal of Freedom award. After Apollo 17 Gene is promoted to a higher management level under Kraft so his days as being in direct control as \\"Flight\\" are over.<br /><br />Its incredible the pressure the controllers and Flight worked under. There was life and death decisions, and abort, go or no go decisions that had to be done sometimes in seconds. Only a select few had the mentality to function at this pressure level. Many washed out and those that were good many times got promoted to higher positions.<br /><br />What a great book. Much less ego busting and egotistical put downs like Chris Kraft did in his book Flight ( see my review 3 stars).  Gene Krantz is a man that knew he needed help from other people who were smarter than he and was able to work in teams with hundreds of men.He learned much from many and gave credit to those who helped and were the best of the best in their job specialties.  Gene was not afraid to tell people including Chris Kraft that he believed they were wrong in some aspects of a mission.Sometimes he was right sometimes wrong. We see the new breed of flight controllers trained that were faster and brighter with faster technology than the Kraft and Krantz generation.Krantz helped develop a degree of excellence and mission rules for the controllers and Flight that they must work through their problems, be prepared and have a deep mind set that \\"Failure is not an option\\". The torch is passed.<br /><br />A great ending of the book. Krantz tells us that NASA has deteriorated and does not have a clear direct to go deep into manned space. We need a leader like John Kennedy to set up a bold mission to go to Mars and beyond. Congress must get involved and support NASA.<br /><br />An excellent book that helps describe ground control in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo eras. Thanks Gene Krantz for your contributions to manned space. 5 starsKraft that he believed they were wrong in some aspects of a mission.Sometimes he was right sometimes wrong.

B0043RSIUK|1.0|Even though it appears that the price of this book has been reduced, no doubt due to the poor reception, and even though I have been waiting for it, I have vowed to not purchase this particular book until it is priced at $4.99...or until I find it at a garage sale.    To all of those people who are irritated that the reviews don't have anything to do with the book itself, consider the results. I applaud everyone for standing their ground and voting with their reviews, as it has proven most effective.     E-books do so much more than just save trees, although that is a huge positive. Consider the cost savings for the publisher and distrubutor on warehousing (receiving, shipping, real estate, utilities) transportation (of the raw trees and the finished products - fuel, processing, employees), retail storefront savings (employees, real estate, building overhead) theft. Consider that the book that you are reading is a single file, produced 1 time, for which the storage (computer servers, memory, tech staff) is dirt cheap and transportation costs and raw materials are relatively non existent, then consider what a huge favor you are doing for the publisher by purchasing an e-book for even $9.99. Their profits have increased and they are trying to charge us for the priveledge rather than thank us for the gift.    Typical corporate BS. You're welcome, Penguin :-)
0316069485|5.0|Michael Connelly brings together criminal defense attorney Michael (Mickey) Haller and his half-brother, the cynical and battle-scarred LAPD Detective Harry Bosch, in \\"The Reversal.\\"  Mickey calls himself \\"the defender of the damned,\\" a job he has had for over twenty years.  \\"During that time,\\" he states, \\"I'd grown a suspicion and distrust of prosecutors and police....\\"  Still, the L. A. District Attorney convinces Mickey to go over to the dark side as an independent special prosecutor in the second trial of Jason Jessup.  The defendant has already spent twenty-four years in San Quentin for abducting and strangling twelve-year-old Melissa Landy.  Over the last two decades, Jessup filed numerous motions and appeals while steadfastly proclaiming his innocence.  Much to his delight, the California Supreme Court reversed his conviction and sent the case back to Los Angeles County \\"for either retrial or dismissal of the charges.\\" Against his better judgment, Mickey agrees to take the case, partly because it will give him an opportunity to work with his ex-wife, deputy district attorney Maggie McPherson, and Harry Bosch, who will be their investigator.<br /><br />Jessup has a groundswell of support from the liberal media and an organization of lawyers known as the Genetic Justice Project.  Although the physical evidence against Jessup may be a bit shaky, Melissa's sister, Sarah, who was thirteen when the murder occurred, vehemently stands by her eyewitness identification of Jessup as Melissa's abductor.  However, Sarah has a history of drug abuse and run-ins with the law which the defense will undoubtedly exploit in an attempt to discredit her.<br /><br />This is one of Connelly's most suspenseful and involving legal thrillers in years.  It has incisive and realistic dialogue, compelling courtroom scenes, well-drawn characters, and a carefully constructed plot. Fascinating details about surveillance, trial strategy, forensics, and police procedure add to the book's verisimilitude. The only false note is that when Mickey is on the scene, he is the first-person narrator, but otherwise, Connelly writes in the third person.  This is slightly jarring; Connelly might have been better off sticking to the third person throughout, especially since Haller, McPherson, and Bosch all share the spotlight.  Another familiar face is FBI profiler Rachel Walling, who makes a strong cameo appearance when Bosch requests her analysis of Jessup's behavior.  Harry stands out as the person most invested in nailing Jessup, partly because Harry has sole responsibility for his fourteen-year-old daughter whom he adores, and partly because he has worked tirelessly on hundreds of homicides during his thirty-five year career as a cop.  He is passionate about finding the bad guys and putting them away so that they cannot do any more damage.<br /><br />In \\"The Reversal,\\" the author effectively shows how politics and public opinion influence the legal process; how the stress of trying a high-profile case can lead to mistakes in judgment; and the importance of always being prepared for the unexpected.  Readers who crave a feel-good ending may balk at the novel's disquieting finale.  Others may find Connelly's conclusion thought-provoking, daring, and original.  It certainly demonstrates the ways in which life's vicissitudes and the capriciousness of fate can undermine the search for truth and pervert the course of justice.e only false note is that when Mickey is on the scene, he is the first-person narrator, but otherwise, Connelly writes in the third person.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|The first season of Spartacus: Blood and Sand is as good as adult TV gets -- assuming you're up for some gore.    The hyper-real visuals are stunning and artistically rendered.   The casting is superb.   I can't name a character I would have preferred someone else play.   The story lines are engaging and animate and flesh out the characters in a short time, which is what ultimately makes or breaks any serial.   I found the episodes sticking with me for days after I watched one.  Must see!
0307592839|5.0|A Visit from the Goon Squad is the story of Bennie Salazar, a record executive, and Sasha, his troubled young assistant. Truthfully, though, there is nothing basic about this novel, and no brief synopsis can begin to express its scope.<br /><br />This book captivated me from the first sentence: \\"It began in the usual way, in the bathroom of the Lassimo Hotel.\\" The first chapter introduces us to Sasha, and the humor and wit of Egan's writing is entrancing:<br /><br />  \\"Coz liked the couch, he'd told her, because it relieved them both of the burden of eye contact. 'You don't like eye contact?' Sasha had asked. It seemed like a weird thing for a therapist to admit. 'I find it tiring,' he'd said. 'This way, we can both look where we want.'<br /><br />Egan's writing is both literary and accessible. The novel builds on both its characters and its writing; it's utterly masterful. I could not put it down during the day I read it, but I read slowly and savored each word and section. As I first began the novel, I thought it was interconnected stories. As I read more, however, I agreed with the book jacket: it's \\"interlocking narratives.\\" It has the narrative voice of a novel, even as it's narrator changes and time jumps forward and backward.<br /><br />I was intrigued about the chapter written as a PowerPoint presentation before I started the novel, and as I was falling in love with it, I hoped it would live up to my expectations. It exceeded them. While the PowerPoint chapter was my second favorite, it was able to be because of the sections that came before it. My eventual favorite was the novel's last chapter, which should convince any skeptic holdouts A Visit from the Goon Squad is indeed a novel.<br /><br />Although difficult to describe, this novel is easy to love. Highly recommended for fans of literary fiction, short stories and good narratives.

0316098337|5.0|Room is the story of Jack, a five-year-old boy who has never left Room. He loves his Ma and he loves his life. He doesn't realize there's a world outside of room and that he and his mother are locked in Room without means of escape.<br /><br />I'd like to introduce you to my new all-time favorite book. I hope this review makes me you read this marvelous novel, so I won't spend much time on the plot and particulars. I want you to experience them for yourselves as I was so fortunate to do. With that in mind, prepare for some gushing.<br /><br />Admittedly, the subject matter of this novel sounds a little dreary. When I first heard about Room, I wanted to read it, but I didn't expect to love it. Donoghue made the bold choice to have Jack narrate this entire book, and his perspective on life is absolutely fascinating. I didn't expect to relate to a five-year-old, but I cannot imagine the book being told another way. Despite being told from the world view of a five-year-old who doesn't know there is a world outside of Room, Donoghue infuses knowledge and depth to his mother. The reader takes the observations of Jack and understands his world far differently than he does.<br /><br />Room grabbed me immediately. It almost feels dystopian, and reminding myself Jack's life is reality for some children was heartbreaking. As the details and layers of Jack's reality unfold, it's fascinating to see life through Jack's eyes. Jack's nature keeps this book from becoming too dark. He has a child's optimism, buoyancy, fascination and genuine happiness. He's a boy who has never been away from his mother, whom he adores.<br /><br />Donoghue wowed me throughout this novel. I was mesmerized by her characters, dialogue, story, construction and bravery. I desperately wished I could have read it in one sitting. I contemplated calling in sick to work because I had one hundred pages left and could not bear to put it down. (Don't worry, I resisted temptation and made it to work.) Despite being captivated from the novel's first pages by Jack's unique narrative voice, it still got better as it went along. I found no weaknesses.<br /><br />Before I finished it, I found myself wondering if this novel could be my new favorite novel. It has. I'm always leering of declaring something my favorite, but Room affected me so deeply in a way I honestly thought a book might not be able to do again. Room is unique, original and amazing. Time will tell if Room truly is my favorite book ever. It's unseating Curtis Sittenfeld's American Wife, which managed to maintain the honor for almost two years. I've read many five star books since then, but for me, calling a book my favorite is an incredibly personal thing. (I know no one who has enjoyed American Wife as much as I did). Yes, it must be well-written, but mostly it must make me feel amazed. It must somehow shift my perspective on life and humanity. Being a favorite is very much a product of my reaction to a novel. I can't explain or predict the novels that move me in this way, but I'm always quite surprised. Despite being a voracious reader and lover of books, I realized I never expected to have a new favorite book again. (Tune in this Sunday, August 8 for a post on other past favorite books.)<br /><br />Room is intense, but it's so well written, relatable and humane. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I do recommend, however, that you don't start it until you have time to finish it. It is a one-setting novel.rst pages by Jack's unique narrative voice, it still got better as it went along.

1591841666|2.0|After reading this little book and some of the reviews of Godin's other book \\"Linchpin\\" it seem to me that an obvious point is being missed. Who wouldn't want a bunch of exceptional people working for them in a business or factory. The problem is exceptional people by definition are few and far in between. And even if those kind of people were plentiful, there is not enough room at the top where these people aspire and companies want them.    Can these authors be overlooking such a simple point or are they just doing a lot of hand-waving and hope the proactive masses don't notice until they have bought the book. I hope it is the former.

1442337966|1.0|I definitely DO NOT recommend \\"THE POWER\\" CD's.  I absolutely loved \\"The Secret\\" CD's, I still listen to them many, many times over. However, I was so disappointed with \\"The Power\\" CD's.  I found that Ronda Byrne included way too many examples using negative-like statements & topics about what you shouldn't do, & what you can't do & what won't work.  I was hoping that she would have followed up with a more POSITIVE approach to help one continue the lessons learned in THE SECRET, and more visualization techniques to help remain positive. I did not like the annoying background sound effects. I was trying to listen to every word and so trying to concentrate on the message Rhonda Byrne is talking about, but time & time & time again I would get so dsatracted by the background voices and sounds. I kept having to back-up the CD to listen again to what was being said.  Sounds like the \\"countdown of a rocket\\"...I could see a rocket getting ready for take off, rather than hear her message, or traveling subject \\"train sounds\\", or her sister sent her flowers \\"doorbell\\". It was so annoying, and so unnecessary.  I would also find myself Fast Forwarding past a negative sounding subjects/sentences.  Finally, well into the 2nd CD, it just caused me such distress, I just popped the CD out and put in a CD of ABRAHAM by Esther Hicks, to get my mind back on the subject of wonderful things in life.  I will probably just resale it on ebay or the like.  I will certainly be hesitant to buy anymore of Ronda Byrnes follow-up CD's and products. I definitely do not recommend \\"THE POWER\\" CD's.  However, \\"The SECRET\\" - An Overwhelmingly YES! And, for more of this topic, I strongly recommend \\"ABRAHAM by Esther Hicks\\" CD, for REALLY feel-good listening!

0316069485|5.0|Connelly constructs a fascinating scenario of role reversal featuring Mickey Haller, well-known defense attorney, in the role of prosecutor: \\"Mickey Haller for the People. Has a nice ring to it.\\" Twenty-four years earlier, Jason Jessup was convicted of the abduction/murder of twelve-year-old Melissa Landy, snatched from her front yard and tossed, dead, into a dumpster. The lynchpin of the prosecution's case is the eye witness, Melissa's sister, Sarah, who identified Jessup in the first trial. New DNA evidence has earned Jessup a retrial, Haller tapped by the DA to keep Jessup behind bars- and save the county a lot of money in the bargain. Haller has two demands: his choice of second chair and Detective Harry Bosch of LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division as his lead investigator. Assistant DA Maggie McPherson is the mother of a girl near the same age as Jessup's victim, her prosecutorial talent buried in an obscure office in the valley. This high-profile case offers Maggie an opportunity to shine.<br /><br />The fact that Bosch also has a daughter near the victim's age adds to the emotional texture of the plot. Vying with the courtroom drama are the complex agendas of the characters. Coached by a wily defense attorney, Clive Royce, Jessup's actions are calibrated to appeal to the public as a victim of the justice system's overreach: \\"His eyes went from the steely glare of the predator to the wounded look of a victim.\\" The dark overtones of the crime weigh heavily on Haller and his team, the slick Royce playing to the jury's suspicion of the LAPD's reputation. While Mickey and Maggie argue pre-trial briefs before a strict judge, Bosch faces the daunting task of locating the victim's sister, the crux of the prosecution's case since most former witnesses are deceased. Leaving a trail of drug abuse and criminal arrests, Sarah is in the wind, arguably as much a victim as her sister.<br /><br />The theme is contemporary, new DNA evidence undermining the conviction of a child-killer, a crime as old as civilization, but it is the legal system that has become more sophisticated, Royce employing all the dirty tricks at his disposal- the very same moves that have benefited Haller in his successful career. Now Haller must build an unassailable case out of the detritus of twenty-four year old evidence and the testimony of a drug addict. Frustrated by the bloodless skirmishes of the legal system, Bosch feels Jessup's wrongness in his bones, obsessed with proving the media's cause du jour a monster that will kill again.

B003TXKSWK|5.0|I won't make this a long and drawn out review. All I will say is this is my favorite release of the year. It's definitely what we need in music right now...actual music, with real people playing and singing and interpreting songs. John and The Roots did an amazing job with this one. The greatest part is the song selection, which speaks to our current state and conditions. It could have been easy to go a safer route and choose songs such as Marvin's What Going On or Stevie's Living For The City, which would have cheapened the cd. I love the fact that these are somewhat obscure selections and not known by the larger mainstream. It gives the artists the chance to exercise their interpretive skills, while allowing audiences to discover this music, which may not have been known to them. I LOVE IT!!! Unfortunately, due to our current musical climate, this release may go unnoticed by the mainstream, which will be a complete shame. I encourage everyone to WAKE UP and buy this cd. Christmas is coming up, Birthdays are happenings, take advantage. A modern day Classic!
B001R88C6I|4.0|[Non-spoiler comments]<br />I've seen this film a few times, mainly because I like wrapping my mind around multiple-world concepts. While 13th Floor doesn't reach the cinematic or conceptual heights and depths of Blade Runner and other true classics of the genre, it's certainly worth seeing. The performances are good if mostly not great, though the script is quite solid, and while the few effects are kind of hokey, both 1937 L.A. and the details in the modern world are very nicely designed and make the film worth seeing a few times.<br /><br />It's hard not to compare this with The Matrix, as the basic concept is quite similar, and the feel is clearly 1999, though TM is truly superior in almost every way. 13th wisely avoids going for the full-on effects, and its small budget forces it to use the philosophical pretexts well. Bierko and Mol and Stahl are acceptable, but Stahl and especially the redoubtable D'Onofrio add considerably more brio to their roles. Vincent has taken many a decent film and notched it up with his unique charisma, and this is no exception.<br /><br />I do think that if D'Onofrio and Bierko had reversed roles here, it would be a far better film. Bierko just doesn't have the dramatic depth. Stahl outmatches him in every scene, but when Stahl and D'Ono get together here, those brief scenes steal the film, dramatically.<br /><br />And Dennis Haysbert should give back his acting fees for every film he's ever made now that he's the Allstate guy! I can't see him or hear his voice in anything without immediately thinking of insurance sleaziness, which is great for them but miserable for all the films he's in. I know that seems like a joke, but I swear he really pulls me out of this movie whenever he shows up. And, frankly, it's no wonder he became a pitchman, as he's no great actor. He overplays this role and should have watched Ford in Blade Runner to see how to make laconic say so much more than snidely menacing.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is mostly crisp, but certain scenes suffer from a lower transfer quality than others, which can be momentarily distracting. There are actually less extras than the dvd, which is pointless and a bit of a rip-off at double the price. Unless you worship this movie, I'd say go for the dvd. The transfer is good but not world-class; the Matrix blu-ray blows this out of the water.<br /><br />[Spoiler thoughts]<br />One of the weakest moments here for me is when they reach the end of their world and it looks like an outtake from Tron. Come on, is that really the best that could be done? Half-done green-line renderings of distant mountains? The programmers would simply program nothing there, not a tracery in LED lines. Better to simply show an edge-of-nothingness scenario. It jars me out of the well-made world of the film into realizing this is an occasionally hokey sci-fi film.<br /><br />Ditto with the Pink Floyd laser spray when they enter the Other World. Come on! It's pointless and distracting and makes the clean jack-in of The Matrix seem pure and elegant by comparison. Which is a drag, as the set design of 13th Floor is otherwise so well done, with many tiny details that add much to the feel.<br /><br />Galouye's Simulacron-3 novel inspired this story, and I also think the writers here missed the mark by not using more of his ideas. He explored the philosophical implications of the triple-world idea to greater effect than this did, and seeing as that's the key to the whole premise, it deserves more weight. There are SO many possibilities with that concept, and they're barely scratched here in favor of the rather weak love story. To my mind that's the single greatest flaw in 13th Floor: it has so many deeper moments waiting in those other potential realities and it just lets them slide on by.<br /><br />One thing I do like is how we're shown but never told that when you die in your double, his consciousness replaces yours in your world. It's a fine double-jeopardy idea thatworks even better for us having to notice it ourselves. But it does set up a really cheesy Hollywood ending that distracts from the weight of the ideas here. What about getting stuck in the third world? So many maybes disposed of in favor of a weak wrap-it-up-neatly denouement.<br /><br />Anyhow, just one sci-fi fan's opinion. But what do I know; I'd like to see almost every Philip K. Dick story set to film, so I tend to want to see the ideas more than the drama in these movies. 13th Floor offers more melodrama than conceptual brilliance, but it's certainly worth seeing and is holding up well as the years go by.up a really cheesy Hollywood ending that distracts from the weight of the ideas here.

B0017JKEL8|5.0|Very much enjoyed the first season of Mad Men. It really takes you back to the late 50's early 60's. Very good writing.  On the negative side, it was extremely distracting with all the DVD problems. Disc 2 stopped 7 times, skipped quite a few times more. The second show of disc 1 was the same as was the second show of disc 3.

It is excellent music though, for those who love the style.    If you're picking it up just to hear the \\"BBBBBBRRRRRRRUM\\" song, look elsewhere. You'll find the rest of the music disappointing.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|This is a ridiculous price to set for a piece of digital content.  I realize Mr. Follett worked very hard on his book, as many note who support the pricing, but so has every other novelist who has committed words to paper.  The only thing that makes Mr. Follett special is his belief (or possibly just the belief of his publisher, in which case I would urge him to find a better publisher or opt to self-publish) that he is entitled to charge as much for a piece of digital content as he does for one which must be printed, bound, jacketed, shipped and stored.  A digital book can be reproduced a million times in minutes for only the cost associated with storing the electronic file, which in this case is only a little over 2 megabytes, or half the size of a typical MP3 song.  To not pass that savings on to the consumer as, at the very least, a mild discount is cynical and assumes the consumer is a moron.  That said, the position of this book on Amazon's ebook sales list would indicate that there are an abundance of readers who are, indeed, not the brightest bulbs on the proverbial string.      Furthermore, as a social consequence, this behavior needlessly discourages consumers from adopting a technology that reduces the negative environmental impact of the production of books.  Given that all costs associated with creating a digital book are less than creating a hardcover, there is no justifiable financial incentive for the publisher to dissuade a consumer from choosing a more environmentally friendly option if said consumer has made the initial investment in the hardware.  It is, in fact, excellent PR for a company to price a socially responsible product at an attractive level.    I, for one, will not be buying the book until the author or the publisher decides to rethink their pricing philosophy.  Here's hoping.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I use this watch and the Garmin Connect software all the time. It is a great triathlon and running training tool as well as a fairly stylish sports watch to wear during work. If given the choice again, I would definitely buy it. However, the bezel is a little annoying and difficult to navigate...hopefully Garmin will improve on the next model. Also, I used to have the Forerunner 305 and I liked that it had a little navigation information - enough to get me out of being lost in the wilderness on my hike or mountain bike. It was clunky though and I ended up slicing it in half on a tree while mountain biking. The 405CX does not have the navigation capabilities, but it does have everything needed for training. The wireless synch is also a great feature.     Overall, I will most likely stick to Garmin for my future training watches <hopefully my 405CX will not encounter a demise like my 305 and will last for a long time!>

B000ZLFALS|5.0|I LOVE LOVE this movie!  I first heard about it on Oprah.  The whole cast visited.  I had a particular interest in Jim Sturgess who plays the character Jude.  What interested me was the fact that the actors were all actually singing the songs.  So naturally I either rented the movie or saw it on HBO or STARZ a couple of years ago.  I was hooked.  I bought the soundtrack off iTunes and finally bought the Blu-ray!  I'm am very excited to add this to my collection!
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|This new direct to DVD release from Disney, that is due to hit shelves on September 21st, certainly could have rescued us from the bleak summer of over hyped 3D animated films had Disney chosen to give it a theatrical unveiling.  Nonetheless, this simple well told story is a treat for the whole family that is sure to put some fun into your Fall.    Yes, as the film opens, the computer animations is a bit lifeless, and definitely takes some getting used to, but once the excellent vocal talents begin to bring their characters to life, the film jumps off the screen.    In Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue, we find Tink (Mae Whitman) and her friends off to summer camp on the main land.  Tink is of course curious about everything, especially humans, and though she is consistently warned to stay away from them, it is not long before she encounters one.  Lizzy (Lauren Mote) who happens to be a fairy fanatic, is out in the country with her father (Yes, another Disney character with an absent mother) for the summer.  With dad (Michael Sheen) being all wrapped up in his work which conveniently has to do with entomology, Lizzy is left alone to play and fantasize about the world of fairies, until you know who drops into who her playhouse.    Though communication is a struggle between our two characters as Tinks voice sounds like small bells ringing to Lizzy, it does not take Tink long to realize that this human has a good heart and is in need of a friend.  As Tink and Lizzy build a friendship, the rest of the fairies set out on an adventure to rescue our heroine from the humans.    Director Bradley Raymond deserves accolades here as he allows for well developed characters that are endearing to the audience to drive this simple story.  The audience enjoys the relationships established and truly cares about the plight of each character.     The music and vocal talents enhance each segment and literally bring life to animation.    Bonus Material:    At only 77 minutes the main feature certainly leaves you wanting more, but there is plenty of bonus material to satisfy young and old alike.      Calling a preview to an upcoming release \\"Bonus Material\\" is a bit generous and \\"Tangled\\", Disney's new take on the story of Rapunzel, looks a bit desperate in it's attempt to bring life to what appears to be a fairly one dimensional story.     The generally standard \\"Deleted Scenes\\" section is a pleasant surprise in this release as Director Bradley Raymond and Producer Helen Kalafatic introduce and discuss each deleted scene, and convey an almost parental guardedness towards that which was left out of the film.  Watching the incomplete segments lends a unique insight into the developmental process.     The music video \\"How to Believe\\" by Bridgit Mendler is very enjoyable.    At less than two minutes in length; the \\"Design a Fairy House\\" segment lacks focus and seems incomplete.    The \\"Fairy Field Guide Builder\\" will be fun for the young.    Recommendation: The new release Blu-Ray+DVD combo pack is a great buy for every family.  There is enough interesting material in the story to engage those who grew up with Tinker Bell and Peter Pan, and the energy in The Great Fairy Rescue will keep the children glued to the screen.

0385504225|3.0|For those of you who have read his other books, this one predictably follows the same general formula. This is no great literary work, and doesn't make you think too hard, but it's a good fast paced diversional read for a rainy day or to pass time. You just have to shut off certain parts of your brain to enjoy it and not think too hard afterwards. I thought that the book was mostly enjoyable and kept me turning the pages, and I was pleased that the setting was in Washington DC because it's one of my favorite cities and I know Washington DC fairly well enough to visualize where the characters are. I've seen the insides of most of the buildings mentioned, including the Capitol Rotunda, Cathedral, and the \\"Jungle\\" at the USBG. Actually, that's probably why I like the Robert Langdon books, because I love travel and art, I've been to cities all over Europe like Rome and Paris before ever reading the books, and I'm interested in art history, art symbolism and the history of the buildings and monuments, and Brown's books incorporate all of the places I've seen into his stories. Of course, the book wasn't without it's flaws and holes, though. The villain in The Lost Symbol was way over the top, overdone and just a little too kooky to be truly believable for me. And after Robert and Katherine were each fooled once by a phone call from the villain, they were fooled again, so the characters are too trusting and don't appear to learn from their mistakes. The story really didn't explain why the CIA was involved suddenly in the investigation, and the reader has to assume that an unknown mason alerted the head of the CIA(who was a Mason) to the crime. I actually didn't think the CIA had enough motivation or jurisdiction to go after the villain. Also it bothered me that Katherine wasn't conducting experiments according to proper research methods...I hate to nitpick but I have a science degree and it irritates me when authors overlook something like that, so in my point of view herresearch didn't seem legitimate and I had to consciously ignore it to get on with the story.     I was also disappointed in the ending...sorely disappointed because the beginning and middle of the book were promising. It fell flat. It was too preachy about religions and truths and New Agey stuff. It would have been so much better if there were actually a \\"hidden treasure\\" at the end or if Noetics and the power of the mind was demonstrated in the book by a character to be real and could be used as an actual mind weapon in the wrong hands. Governments really did do research into pseudosciences like remote viewing in the past so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch if they were interested in using Noetics as a weapon or preventing it from falling into the wrong hands, and I wouldnt think any less of Dan Brown if this turned it into a science fiction novel, as it was on the verge of being science fiction anyway because Noetics is really a pseudoscience, not real science. That would have raised the stakes in the book instead of the threat of embarrassing a bunch of politicians, all of whom will most likely embarrass themselves on their own eventually. Compared to the other Langdon books, I enjoyed Angels and Demons or even DaVinci Code better because the stakes were higher and even the villains had better motives to commit their crimes.

B003WKFAIW|5.0|Music has been very slow in terms of great new releases, so of course when Maroon 5 announced their third album I was eager to here it. 'Misery, is typical Maroon 5, great rhythem catchy hooks and the radio loves it. Yet, when I heard the rest of this album, I was blown away.<br /><br />Maroon 5 is like a fine wine, every time they make a new album it is better from the last. Their sound on 'Hands All Over' is a much more grander sound. The songs have so much more going on in them in terms of lyrics and musician ship. The vocals have improved tremendously and I love the new sounds that are used with each song. They have pulled some elements from great artists, like Billy Joel in 'I Can't Lie' (My favorite on the album) The Eagles with Out of Good byes and I love the use of disco elements and beautiful piano.<br /><br />It took me a while to warm up to these guys when they first made their debuet and it took a few listens when their sophmore dropped. But this one I loved right from the start and it is still in my cd player two weeks after its release. I recommend it and I would not be surprised it was up for a few Grammys this year.
0374530718|4.0|I am ordering this book for my 13 years old boy, who starts to show interest in serious books.  I read this book a few years ago. I never had much of western philosophy history, so this book was an eye opener for me.  The few pages of each topics not only give a summary or synopses of the philosophers and his/her idea, they generate interest that can be follow up with more reading in the topics.  As many noted, it is the story that is make me gives this book a 4 stars. Without the philosophy lesson, the story would get even lower rate from me.
0316069485|4.0|I like Michael Connolly's writing.  Detective Harry Bosch is among the leading characters of the genre, having been developed over the course of many novels; however, in Reversal, Bosch becomes part of an ensemble cast, his becomes a supporting role.  Reversal's protagonist is Mickey Haller, a veteran of two prior books--a character not yet nearly as completely drawn and therefore lacking the complexity of Detective Bosch.  The story of the re-trial of a child murderer, the reversal of whose conviction gives its name to the tale, Reversal has as much to say about the importance of good police work as the nature of justice as served by our legal system.<br /><br />This is a legal fantasy novel.  Sure, the author has researched his stuff and he is (largely) correct on the procedure but it comes together in a way that only happens in fiction.  No explanations here because that would spoil the read, however, I note that Connolly anticipates incredulity by offering it up through other characters in the story.  Law lends itself to fiction because it allows for a life and death drama to be played out in a systematic fashion--most of us have been jurors, after all.  Being a lawyer, albeit a civil lawyer, perhaps I am only noticing that which has been apparent to police detectives throughout the Bosch series--real life is never so neatly resolved. Reversal represents a confluence of a number of rare events, a combination of events not often encountered in the singular much less the plurality evident in this story.  But I cannot blame the author for introducing fantastic elements because the twists and turns of actual litigation are often far less believable than the plot created by an imaginative author; you can't fault Connolly for coming up with a fantastic story because, for example, who would believe the OJ story if we hadn't lived through it.<br /><br />Connolly refrains, thankfully, from the moral ambiguity that is the hallmark of other authors.  His is still a world of honest cops and ethical lawyers--though his characters are aware of and note the boundaries of ethics, Connolly's drama is played out by what happens to the ostensible bad guy and our author does not spare characters who cross ethical lines from the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />I enjoyed Reversal, reading it was time well spent with an author now so skilled that he can make serious effort look easy.  The only problem is that one must judge Reversal against other Connolly books and because so much effort has been put into developing Harry Bosch's character, Haller's journey does not yet produce as much interest.  The characters in this book do not really have quite the same internal struggles as in Connolly's other novels--but this is merely a quibble because Haller is a newer character lacking the backstory of Bosch.  The book was worth every penny, a good read by a fine author.nd ethical lawyers--though his characters are aware of and note the boundaries of ethics, Connolly's drama is played out by what happens to the ostensible bad guy and our author does not spare characters who cross ethical lines from the consequences of their actions.

B00364K6YW|5.0|After lots of confusion on which reviews were pertaining to the restored edition and which the original, I finally decided to just get it and I was NOT disappointed!  The film is amazing, and many will give details on that - this review pertains specifically to the technical changes in the restored edition.<br /><br />I was SHOCKED how many details were lost in the original version. Having worked in a photolab for over a decade and having a degree in photography I am very much of a color snob.  The quality (or lack thereof) in the original version was disappointing - the fact that I watched the movie time and time again speaks to how good the acting and film were to overcome the visual lack luster.<br /><br />I oooo'd and ahhhhhh'd in each scene seeing details with fresh eyes on the new version.  My biggest complaint is that sometimes the skin tones looked OVER saturated, causing people to look a bit on the red or orange side. But I would happily put up with that for all over the rest of the splendor the colors bring. The rooms in the houses truly look lush and rich - beautiful tones, not just beautiful shapes and textures.<br /><br />Truly worth the investment as this is by far still the best Pride & Prejudice available on film :)
0316069485|4.0|The Reversal brings together Mickey Haller, erstwhile defense attorney (Brass Verdict, Lincoln Lawyer) with long time Connelly hero LAPD detective Harry Bosch.  The men are half brothers but uncomfortable allies in this thriller.  Haller, a fairly brash and arrogant character in earlier novels has grown psychologically and hence crosses over to the district attorney's side to prosecute a child murderer who is being released from prison after 24 years.  His release is based on a new DNA finding.  Bosch is in a supporting role as his investigator though he is almost a co-lead in this story.  Also playing a supporting role is Haller's ex-wife Maggie McPherson as a prosecuting attorney assisting Haller in this case.  One of the things I like so well about the Connelly novels is the way he develops and continually expands our knowledge of his characters; when he intermingles them in novels that only adds to the fun.<br />The story, replete with the expected twists and turns is a convincing police/legal procedural, certainly up to the standard we have come to expect from Connelly.  The action is fast paced and I think tempts the reader to stay up half the night finishing this story.  There were two items that prevented me from giving this story five stars.  One I struggled with the change in voice.  When Haller spoke it was in the first person, when Bosch was the key character it was described in the third person.  This might have worked if Bosch was not so frequently present in the story, but for me it was confusing and took some getting used to as the action moved along.  The second problem for me was the ending, it was without drama.  I won't give away the ending but I bet you guess what happens fairly quickly.  There was lots of psychological baggage and moral ambiguity picked up by both Haller and Bosch that I am sure will reappear in future novels.  Definitely a solid effort from Connelly!

B000068PQ7|3.0|I love Gene Clark solo and with The Byrds.  He's one of the few of my 60s heroes who was still doing mesmerizing stuff right up till the end.  Check out the Gypsy Angel collection.  The \\"Gene Clark/White Light\\" album has always frustrated me due to the pale version of One in a Hundred (compared with the juicy, beaty Byrds version), the bouncy attempt at Tears of Rage and the decidedly odd 1975.  The latter is superseded on this release by one of the bonus tracks which sounds like an \\"in progress\\" version of 1975 and is better for it.  At the same time of course there are tracks like Because of You and Spanish Guitar, which rank amongst his greatest achievements.  One problem with Clark's albums is that most of them are so short, and this is one of those.  I get to the end of Side 2 just wishing for at least one more track.  Another reason why we end up creating playlists, I suppose...

0316069485|5.0|Harry Bosch has always has always had a clearly defined job with the LAPD standing for the dead and being a voice for those that have had theirs silenced.  The last few months have thrown him many curves with the death of his ex-wife and the incorporation of his daughter Madeline into his life full time but he still cuts through on a straight path.  Michael Haller has also known what his job definition is until the day the District Attorney made the call and asked him to move across the aisle from defense attorney to prosecutor.  The DA makes Mickey a one-time proposition Mickey does not want to turn down but truly questions if he can bear the burden of standing for the people and doing right by them.  The opportunity being offered is to keep Jason Jessup, a child killer behind bars even though new DNA testing evidence can exonerate him and would potentially set him free after 24 years in prison.  Mickey chooses his side and incorporates his ADA ex-wife, Maggie McPherson and Harry into the mix which makes the entire situation workable and possibly winnable.<br /><br />Mickey and Harry are half-brothers who have shared some case time but not even that interaction can prepare them for what they are about to face both personally and professionally together.  Mickey has no intention of letting this killer walk and plans to use some of his favorite tricks against the high profile lawyer Jessup has working for him who may be clever but Mickey knows slick does not compensate for the facts and if he can find the key missing witness, reconstruct the police work and piece together fact from media hype he will not only win this but make it a slam dunk sending this murderer back to prison.<br /><br />As the trial moves forward and the days drag on Jessup becomes more intense and his actions more sporadic.  The FBI profiler has concerns about what might happen when all the stress builds up and has to be released.  The profiler also feels the original case started off in the wrong direction and once re-routed to its proper path Harry discovers something even more horrific may have happened all those years ago.<br /><br />Along the way Mickey and Harry form a bond that draws their daughters into the mix even though Harry is reluctant to start down this road.  Harry has kept Mickey and that family connection at arm's length but now he knows Maddie needs family to help her recover from the loss of her mother and the transition of moving away from friends and living with him.  Maddie is Harry's main focus in life and will do anything to make her happy even if it involves doing things that make her very unhappy with him.<br /><br />I admit openly to being a Harry Bosch fan and find that with age and the addition of the family angle he is even more interesting.  The stories could not be told with another character even with Michael Connelly writing them and this is the one factor that shows in his story telling with Harry.  Mr. Connelly respects his characters and writes them as if they lived next door and he can relate to them making them plausible to the reader.  This story while a horrific nightmare for any parent does also show how venerable Harry has become in his personal life.  He was Teflon before and nothing could touch him but now with his daughter in his life what was once armor is now ice cream.once re-routed to its proper path Harry discovers something even more horrific may have happened all those years ago.

0316069485|4.0|The Reversal presents itself as a legal thriller, again combining his two most popular characters, half-brothers Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch (The Brass Verdict). As that, the book is very successful. You'll be thrilled by the narrative velocity Connelly creates in this story, no doubt about that.<br /><br />But of course, it's more. Because Connelly is more. He wants to challenge our thinking about the legal system itself. About the tenents we value so strongly--and rightly--and how we react when they are perverted.<br /><br />Our Story Begins as Haller is approached to be a Special Prosecutor on the re-trial of one Jason Jessup, recently awarded as the result of re-examination of DNA evidence using techniques not available in the mid-80's when Jessup was convicted of the murder/dumping of a young girl. We've all seen the heart-wrenching stories of falsely-accused inmates freed after long incarceration by the fabulous advances of technology, right?<br /><br />Jessup's case looks to be the latest in the series, and the media is all too eager to anoint it as such. But the DA has other ideas, and feels Haller's reputation as a no-holds-barred-for-the-defense guy creates the perfect counter to the spin. Throw in a little plausible deniability in case of acquittal, and Haller is a perfect fit.<br /><br />Haller demands his ex-wife, ADA Maggie McPherson, be his second chair and Bosch be his lead investigator, and off we go.<br /><br />Connelly does a great job blending the continuity of these two characters, we enjoy watching new cousins meet and bond, and we continue to enjoy Connelly's decision to make Bosch's daughter such a strong part of that world.  The changes Maddie Bosch brings to Harry's hard edges are more real for their subtlety.<br /><br />As Haller, McPherson and Bosch unravel the threads of both the investigation and the trial, Jessup's character is developed and it doesn't take long to fully invest the reader in the proceedings. The process is aided by the colors that Connelly brings to the ancillary characters, primarily Sarah Landry, older sister of the victim all those years past, and, of course, a living victim of the same crime. Her journey to testifying at the trial is a solid support beam to what Connelly is building here.<br /><br />Connelly blends the distinct narrative styles of both series to fine effect in The Reversal, intersecting two of the genre's most popular characters while maintaining individuality.he ancillary characters, primarily Sarah Landry, older sister of the victim all those years past, and, of course, a living victim of the same crime.

I compared it on a linn lp12/helikon, CJ tube pre/amp and the CJ cd player. The bonus tracks are really cool too.

The actual story (once it finally gets going) is satisfyingly horrific, but there is ZERO forshadowing, Blomkvist (the main character) is really wishy-washy, Miss Dragon Tattoo Salander is written as such a cold, antisocial, unfeeling bitch that it is impossible to warm to her in any way! AND, there is absolutely no indication as to why she is how she is - hints and innuendo, form your own opinion, look at her attitude to the villian, etc. Please. A little background on the fictional character, maybe? The intricate computer hacking was interesting, as was the search for the missing heir, but really this was a difficult read to finish. Needless to say, I won't be buying the next 2 in the series!
B000V6981K|5.0|I was hanging around San Francisco's Haight/Ashbury streets in 1968 and dropped-in (literally) to the Avalon Ballroom. It held most of the local music venues until the Filmore, with larger capacity, eclipsed it. I never heard of Blue Cheer before that day and at first they sounded like a decent band. They were back up to a another name band I can't remember now. Blue Cheer at first reminded me of another band the \\"13th Floor Elevator Operators.\\" There were so many bands and when playing live they all had a garage band sound and/or open-air park sound (many played in Golden Gate Park). Even the \\"Airplane\\",  \\"Big Brother\\", \\"Country Joe\\", the \\"Dead\\" had a rawer sound live which faded with each of their albums as studio polish was applied. \\"Blue Cheer\\" maintains much of that raw sound. What I heard after they finished the song I walked into knocked me out. I was already a fan of Eddie Cochran in high school listening to his \\"Summertime Blues\\" and when this, until now, unknown group launched into \\"Summertime Blues\\" it was riveting. This was not just another bay area band this was hard loud rock which grabbed your attention. I don't remember a slow song. Cream and Hendrix all inserted slow songs and the psychedelic appetites of the day required regular fixes of something exotic like sitars, dulcimers or harpsicords with dreamy lyrics. \\"Blue Cheer\\" never let up or let you go. They were hard driving like early \\"Metallica.\\" Yes I am 61 years old boys and girls and listen to hard rock on my MP3 player especially working out. Many have tried to claim collections of 60's top 40 hits take you back to the day but not always for me. If you want the experience it's here: Blue Cheer.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the CGI effects are great. In fact there is much too much of it. This remake does not boast a stellar British cast as the original (Laurence Oliver, Claire Bloom, Maggie Smith) along with Harry Hamlin. Granted the special effects by master Ray Harryhausen seem dated, but the movie had more \\"heart\\". This version takes the original script and turns it around to the point of implausibility. The giant scorpian battle is a highlight but the effect is destroyed later on when the monster are used as transportation. Come on now!<br /><br />In the original, the Gods of Olympus played an important part in the film, which made it more effective, here none of them are showcased except Liam Neeson as Zeus and even that is limited.<br /><br />I was as disapointed in this remake as I was in the remake of \\"The Wolfman\\". Has Hollywood run out of ideas by constant remakes or using comic book and TV sitcoms as a basis for their films, or are they just playing it safe now. Unfortunately the dream factory was creating this havoc long before the meltdown.<br /><br />The effects aren't as impressive, but watch the original. It is far superior.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|From start to finish this album is really fun to listen to. I hadn't even read anything about the CD...just popped it in and started listening. Right away you know something is different: the keyboards. Once again Joe has changed studio bands bringing in Mike Keneally on keys and Allen Whitman on bass.     Not knowing what to expect after recent releases, (Super Colossal and Professor Satch were very technical and the Chickenfoot project was lame) I was happy once I heard the first note. There is amazing guitar work as one would expect on a Satch album, but it's not overdrive...the disc is full of solid, no BS guitar riffs with several keyboard solos. I think playing in a band (Chickenfoot) may have changed his approach a bit.    My favorite songs are \\"Premonition\\" , \\"Pyrrhic Victoria\\" , \\"Two Sides To Every Story\\" (very jazzy!) and \\"Wormhole Wizards\\". There is even a ballad \\"Littleworth Lane\\" which I can envision being played with the 10-minute solo live in concert.     Overall this a very impressive effort and my favorite since \\"Strange Beautiful Music\\" & \\"Crystal Planet\\".

B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|It was B.O.B's mega hit \\"Nothin on You\\" where I was first introduced to the incredibly gifted Bruno Mars. The hook he sung made a lasting impression... On Doo-Wops and Hooligans, Bruno shows the world not only his incredible vocal range but the strength of his song-writting and versatility as a muscian. He plays most of the instruments himself.  The result: Ten great songs with at least three sure fire hit singles. Those being the current r'n'b flavored hit \\"Just the Way you are\\", \\"Grenade\\" (his latest release) and \\"Count on Me.\\" There are even two collaborations. One a reggae styled duet with Damien Marley and the other with Cee Lo and B.O.B  If you love Usher, Outkast, John Legend then pick this cd up. Bruno's voice and style is totally unique. You can't put it into any one box. Here's hoping that this is the first of many cds in a long and promising career...  The one regret: at 35 minutes, the album is far too short. Why not have included \\"Somewhere in Brookyn\\" or even a second remix of \\"Just the Way you are\\"?  UPDATE: Since my initial review Amazon now sells the SPECIAL EDITION CD which is called the Oz or Australian Tour version. It contains the same bonus tracks featured on the Japan-only release.   Here you have all 10 of the original tracks plus the following 6 bonus ones. These being:   1- Just the way you are (remix ft. Lupe Fiasco)   2- Somewhere in Brooklyn (previously only available as a digital download)   3- Talking to the moon (acoustic piano version)   4 - Just the way you are (Walmart Soundcheck version that was recorded in front of a select audience in Las Vegas)   5 - Grenade (Walmart Soundtrack version also from Las Vegas)   6 - The other side (Walmart Soundtrack version live from Las Vegas)  The live tracks illustrate just what a talented singer and band Bruno has and will bring a great smile to you upon listening to them. I know that the price is a bit steep but for you diehards this is the definitive version of Bruno's multi-platinum debut album!   I can hardly wait for his latest single \\"It will rain\\" that is slated to be on the Twillight's Breaking Dawn soundtrack slated for release this November.

B001HUHBAE|5.0|Well there is nothing more than I can say about David Fincher's Zodiac.  Epic in scope and absolutly amazing blu-ray.  By far top five of the best looking and sounding blu-rays I own and will ever own.  Every shot is perfection on precision at at finest.  I highly recommended to any movie/blu-ray lover to buy this one.  An absolute marvel to film making.  Don't miss it.
B002GSXKN8|3.0|This was the only way I would add any of these four Batman installments to my collection.  The movies are entertaining, but horrid and inconsistent compared to the reboot represented by Batman Begins and Dark Knight.  The latter movies have a permanent position in my collection.  This set might get a second viewing before I use it's space for something better.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|It is a sad testament to the state of action movies and actors in this day and age when, for a good action movie, we need to turn to heroes thirty years past their prime.  THIRTY YEARS. Stallone has almost singlehandedly made the point and driven it home, first with RAMBO and now with THE EXPENDABLES even moreso.<br /><br />This is not an art film.  This is not something to be shown to budding students in film school.  This show is something to check your brain at, and be sure to bring the popcorn, because it is a DAMN good time.  Statham is, as far as I know, the only guy here under 40, and not by much.  Stallone should, by all accounts, be able to kick back and spend his social security checks on Metamucil while he watches old Matlock reruns.  Thankfully, he has seen the marked lack of real action talent on-screen and has not given up the mantel yet.<br /><br />In short, there's no great plot here.  No great acting.  No brilliant dialog.  What there is - lots of action, generally well shot.  Lots of good, popcorn fun.  Lots of blood and guts.  And for those not yet jaded, the infamous \\"cameo\\" scene is a fun response to the pinings of generations of action fans.  Placing my order for the Blu Ray as soon as I can.
B001V7P2W2|3.0|The movie itself is great, but the Blu-ray version does not have the extras that a regular Dvd would have.  On a Dvd, they show the helicopter view of the Eiger which is beautiful.  The blu-ray doesn't have that.  Also, on the interviews with the actors, the blu-ray only has the interview written with no video of the actor.  If I had known that I would have purchased the regular Dvd instead of Blu-ray.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|If the book was printed with pages offset so that you couldn't read the left edge of every page would this justify a negative review? What if you returned it several times only to have the replacement show up with the same problem? What if the binding was so bad that pages were falling out? Would a bad review be justified then?     What if a publisher decided to sell all their books through Amazon at twice the price they sell their books at brick and mortar stores (i.e. to help support independent book sellers)? Would giving the book a negative review to protest this policy be justified? What if the publisher decided to start including ads throughout books -- with a couple of those magazine card style ads sprinkled liberally throughout your next hardback. Could you protest this policy with a bad review or should you just shut your mouth and take it? What if the next J.K. Rowling book was only offered to the rich, who could afford the $500 asking price, and then 6 months later it would be released to the general public at $25? Would you protest this new policy?    I believe all of these examples would justify a negative review. In fact, I have given negative reviews to Kindle books that were justified even though they had nothing to do with literary merit. On more than one occasion the conversion from the paper book to the Kindle format was so full of spelling and formatting errors that the book was unreadable, and I gave it a justified negative review.     The bottom line is that we rate books on a variety of criteria, and price is certainly a valid and major criteria upon which to rate books, so I have no problem giving this book a negative review based on this criteria.
0345505387|4.0|I enjoyed this graphic novel from Diana Gabaldon. It's good to have something new from her during the 4+/- year wait between her big books. The Exile is based on the first part of \\"Outlander\\" and is told from Murtagh's perspective. It shows how much Murtagh cared for Jamie and how seriously he takes his responsibity as Jamie's godfather. Some of the artwork is gorgeous and really captures the emotion of the scene; other art panels appear rushed and and too blurry to tell some of the male characters apart. I had to look at the colors of the plaids to tell some guys apart. The artist got a little carried away with cleavage, especially Claire and Mrs. Fitz! The action painting of Jamie stabbing the wild boar is fantastic.     It's not perfect, especially for those of us who always want more detail, but I enjoyed reading (and looking) at something new from a very talented author and artist.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|There are plenty of bands out there who made 1 good albumn. There are even lots of bands who were lucky enough to come out with 2 successful albums...but creating an anthology of CD's that are loved and cherished are what separates truly great artists from mediocre ones.     Congrats to LP for producing 2 amazing CD's in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but those days are long gone, just like Metallica's glory days. Sure their classic songs will always get them recognition on the airwaves, but everrything new they produce is just garbage. It truly does make me wonder how great a band was to begin with.     Maybe LP are just tapped out of ideas? Maybe they plaquerized the songs off their first 2 CD's?     Seriously! I seriously think they just ripped off the fun songs from Hybrid Theory and Meteora! Now that they are left with creating their own music, they are just lost and clueless.     I love music, and can appreciate good music, even if it's not my cup of tea, but this latest effort is just a joke. It's a big \\"F YOU\\" to their fans by creating something that is barely music. Paying $15 bucks for a CD is costly for some, and nothing sucks more than forking over $15 just to listen to something unlistenable...knowing you will never play this CD again.     It's CD's like this that make me listen to every albumn BEFORE I buy it. I would hate to have wasted my own cash on this abortion of a CD. You should be able to file a class action lawsuit or something when bands make music as bad as this. They pretty much are robbing consumers and fans of their money.    Even the coverart is stupid! Just some hokey photoshop radial blur filter??? lol
0307269752|5.0|This was my first non-free book on my new Kindle. I'd put off reading it from<br />the bad reviews .. and that was a<br />mistake. This book is so intriguing that I'd finished reading it in 2 days;  I'd read it on the Kindle in the morning, PC (kindle app) at work and blackberry (kindle app) in the rest-room... that's how engrossing the plot is. Forget about the comments on the violence and sex... this is life. I don't find gratuitous violence but whatever there is, is key to the story and hey in the real world, there are bad mfkers out there. This is the kind of book that once you finish, you want to google the author (sadly long gone, and will be deeply missed). You'd also find that Stieg was an excellent human being, fighting for causes against racists. I will definitely finish the trilogy and also dig up his earlier works.<br /><br />BTW, the story strangely reminds me of The Adventures of Nils, by my favorite Swedish author, Selma Lagerlof.  Totally different genre, but interesting and full of plot changes and a reality-based fairy tale. Not your typical Disneyland fare. Life is tough and hard, but so are humans. We survive.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|Years ago, broadcast TV was full of good (non-reality) shows. Nowadays, not so much. Past seasons, I too would have given this show a 4-star review. It's always been watchable, and Patricia Arquette is dynamic & completely natural in this role, but this season has given us the best from the child actors. Perhaps the change in networks did it good. In any event, I'm glad it's been renewed again.<br /><br />Sofia Vassilieva, in particular, showed immense maturity, range & talent this season. Some of the best scenes of the season involved episodes where her character, Ariel, was the main focus. Two that stand out in my mind are one where she is temporarily overcome by someone else's persona (it sounds ridiculous, but it's played out with care & subtlety) & one in which Ariel loses time inexplicably, seeing herself progress into her twenties & thirties. That episode, which thrust Ariel into her possible future, was wonderfully written & was even one that tugged at the heartstrings. Maria Lark (Bridget) is also a talented young actress, though her versatility & appeal is not up to that of Vassilieva's. I will say that both are actresses that seem like normal children on the show, not obsessed with boys, clothes or computer games. The family element of the show is refreshingly wholesome.<br /><br />That said, some of the subject matter & visual content, especially for a network show, is pretty graphic. If you can't take seeing violence or seeing someone in mortal fear, this is not the show for you. Each show is crafted to make one think, to keep one in suspense & sometimes it shows the darkest side of humanity possible in the process. I think that it's a show which would appeal to loyal viewers of any ghost-related program, \\"Dark Shadows\\" fans from back in the day, programs like that. Despite the fact that this show is about a medium, with psychic visions & dreams, someone who often sees the dead, it comes across in such a way that you can't brandish the characters crazy or even strange. This is \\"real life\\" with a twist. I like Jake Weber as Allison's patient, loving but strong-willed husband & particularly enjoy scenes with David Cubitt (Det. Lee Scanlon). The progression of the supporting characters, delving into their personal lives, has been an enjoyable foray.<br /><br />This is a show you have to watch every minute of, or you'll probably miss something important to the episode. The show typically has a real conclusion at the end of each episode- you're not usually left dangling till next week to see what happened on a particular case. The writing is top-notch, I'd say 90-95% of the time. The episodes are well thought-out & it's a joy to have one program on the air that still shows a family who deeply love each other & are always there for one another.This is \\"real life\\" with a twist.

B000IEPFCG|5.0|I have had this watch for about 5 months now and the accuracy, for an automatic, is fantastic. Less than 10 seconds per week fast. I am a watch lover, and collector, and this watch is one of the best values out there. Attractive, dependable, tough, and no battery to worry about. The Seiko 5 has a long history and many fans and this watch does not disappoint. I also like how versatile it is. It is nice with a sportcoat and is perfect for the beach, hiking, or on the water. Highly recommended.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|Until last year's Arctic Monkeys release, Humbug, this was the most interesting and ingenious songwriting I had heard from Alex Turner. It might have helped that he was teamed up with a group of more experienced musicians for this album. Whatever it was, he carried it over to Arctic Monkeys, making Humbug the band's best album yet.
B000TERKLY|5.0|In my opinion, everything that Pink Floyd released from 1971 to 1979 is a classic masterpiece.  \\"Meddle\\", released in 1971, was the first of many classic albums to come.<br /><br />\\"One of These Days\\" and \\"Echoes\\" are the standout tracks, but the melancholic beauty of \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" also ranks up there with the best of Floyd.  \\"San Tropez\\" is a nice little jazzy number sung by Roger Waters.  Not one of his best, either musically or lyricly, but still fun.<br /><br />\\"Seamus\\" seems to be the only real throwaway song.  Two minutes of a dog barking over some slow blues played by David Gilmour.  Pink Floyd would use barking dogs to much greater effect on the \\"Animals\\" album several years later.<br /><br />Overall, a very solid album, with two \\"essential\\" Floyd masterpieces (with \\"Echoes\\" taking up one whole half of the album).  I wouldn't recommend this as a first purchase, but it would definitely be in my top five.
0525951652|5.0|It appears that all of the negative reviews center around the cost of the electronic version and about how the characters meet up later in life in what perhaps is too contrived or are unrealistic situations....Those critics are missing the point that this is excellent historic fiction surrounding the beginning of World War I.  You will absolutely cheer for the characters and find this Follet novel, difficult to put down.
0765326353|5.0|My worst problem with this book, is that it will be two years before the next book, hopefully he won't fall into the same trap as Jordan did.  With that said, having read this, along with the a couple of his other books, I think Sanderson promises to be one of the greats of his generation.
1433502410|5.0|We received the ESV Study Bible just a few days after ordering.  With Super-Saver we were not sure how long that would be but we were satified.

B0043IL8BA|4.0|...don't judge on just the first taste.    On first listen, History of Modern may sound a little strange and disorienting, but after repeated listens it really sets in and is a great album.    We start with a euro-pop, sing-songy opening track: New Babies; New Toys. Then, a subdued, radio-friendly, enjoyable, circa 80's, second track: If You Want It. Here is when the album really kicks in, starting with History of Modern Parts 1 & 2. Part 1 sounds like a mash-up of elements sampled from practically every other OMD album (catchy lyrics, driving techno keyboards and moody, ambient, orchestral backgrounds - even the last 30 seconds of the track appears to be ghosts of OMD elements/samples...). Part 2 is similar to Part 1 only slowed down, more epic, dancey and presented from a different angle than part 1. After a few listens, long-time OMD fans should really start to hear the echos of the past in these tracks. Sometimes is reminiscent of the great b-side Sugar Tax and is a welcome change of pace on the album. Rfwk sounds like a glossy, 2010 updated version of something written back in 1980. I personally love OMD songs that start subdued, then build up a ton of momentum and drama, usually ending with Andy McCluskey's heart-felt pleading voice. New Holy Ground is the serious, atmospheric ballad of the album. I love the footsteps providing the back beat. The Future, The Past, And Forever After is pretty good--anthem-y and pretty catchy, but probably my least favorite track (though I imagine a remixed version might be really cool). Ah, here comes pure OMD nostalgia... Sister Marie Says. What an awesome, classic OMD track. I've heard it referred to as the cousin of Enola Gay. Absolutely perfect description of  perfect little pop song. Next comes Pulse. Hey? What is Justin Timberlake doing on an OMD album? On first listen this track feels terribly out of place on an OMD album, but dammit--it's pretty catchy and even though I expect some fans to be really irritated by this song, the more I listen to it, the more I like it. I hear a ton of influence from Apollo (a very strange song on the 1984 [[ASIN:B000002GE3 Junk Culture]] album). (In retrospect: OMD have always thrown a weird track on their albums that make fans scratch their heads--which in my book, is a good thing). Green is also oozing with OMD style and is also a great little track. Bondage Of Fate shows off a mature lyrical style and contains the \\"how the heck did they make a waltz beat cool\\" vibe from the Maid Of Orleans days. The Right Side? has the feel of Talking Loud and Clear, with a catchy and strange obfuscated sample: \\"*something* to the right side?\\" Save Me is well, a mash-up. It's ok, but sounds like a B-side to me. If you get the Deluxe version, you get Idea 1, which I absolutely adore. Atmospheric, soundtrack-worthy, minimal, with a simple piano line, sentimental lyrics and interesting samples that make the track very memorable and unique.    If you are an OMD fan familiar with their past albums--you will really like History of Modern. If you are a casual or new OMD fan, this album is pretty good, but to gain full appreciation for this album, I really recommend listening to a few past albums for the full effect. Enjoy!
0143038419|5.0|The book arrived the same day I saw the movie. I really enjoyed the movie, but, had a lot of unanswered questions. I started to read the book that same night and could not put it down. It answered all my questions and confusions.
1594484775|5.0|for one, I have never read any of Nick Horby's other books. I only bought this book because he co-wrote an album called \\"The Lonely Avenue\\" with Ben Folds. I liked how much better the lyrics were in this album compared to many songs that Ben Folds wrote himself. So I thought \\"Well, I should buy his book. Maybe I would like that too.\\"    I was truly impressed with this book. I'm serious. Nick Hornby has a unbelievable talent to write a story in the view of the character he talks about. In other words, If was talking about Annie, he would write about what Annie was thinking as the truth. Vice versa, if he was talking about Duncan, he would write about what Duncan was thinking as the truth. However, these characters \\"truths\\" contradict each other because they are so different. If you dont understand what I mean, you will once you read this book.     The story was great. I actually dont want to write about it on here. I just want more people to read this story and understand the gift that Nick Hornby has in his writing.

0525951652|1.0|I have to agree with all those who object to the pricing - I am so disillusioned by Kindle's reneging on it's promise to offer books at $9.99.  I bought a Kindle at $485 knowing that I would have convenience,access to lots of book and that I would have books at a better price. Seemed like a good investment even if I had to give up the great feeling that comes with holding a hard cover book in your hands and despite some of the erratic formating of words running together on the digital version!!!    Now this book is priced above the hard cover? I love my Kindle but am beginning to really hate the jerking around on the pricing!    Is it true that if the book makes the best seller list the price will be reduced to $9.99? That may be the only thing that keeps me using my Kindle.

0553805371|5.0|It is not beyond comprehension that many view Stephen Hawking as the Einstein of our lifetime. After all, his theories of quantum physics continue the lineage of the core of Einstein's work. In his first major work since 2005's \\"Briefer History of Time,\\" Hawking (and co-author Leonard Mlodinow) tackle one of the most perplexing and thus controversial discoveries of our time; where did we come from and how is it that we are here?<br /><br />\\"The Grand Design\\" postulates, in rather definitive, but often presumptive language, that our existence is the result, not of Einstein's heretofore belief of a unified theory, but of multiple theories or M-theory, an extension of string theory and a widely accepted view of modern physics. The authors fall short of deciding whether there is indeed a God component of the origins of man, but rather discount the issue saying that the existence of God is irrelevant to the discussion of the physical formation of the universe (as well as the existence of the multiverse - multiple universes beyond our own.) At one point, the authors postulate that \\"the universe does not have just a single existence or history, but rather every possible version of the universe exists simultaneously in what is called a quantum superposition.\\" They go on to say that \\"that may sound as outrageous as the theory in which the table disappears whenever we leave the room, but in this case the theory has passed every experimental test to which it has ever been subjected.\\"<br /><br />Reactions have been swift on both sides of the issue and while much of Hawking's theorizing remains unprovable (or at least unmeasurable) at this moment in time, it is not without major reactions both in the U.S. and in Hawking's native England.<br /><br />Rather than indulge in scientific judgment, we instead present a few of the more high-profile reactions to the book and hope the reader will come to their own conclusion:<br /><br />\\"Today, in a pluralistic age, it seems we need a number of overlapping theories with factors in common to describe what we are beginning to call the multiverse. In an environment that includes black holes, super black holes, dark matter, dark energy, string theory, M-theory, alternate pasts and alternate futures, we can no longer assume there is one universe or even a set of universes, with a single group of natural laws applicable to everything from the domain of atoms to that of astronomy.\\" - L.A.

Daryl hangs her in the university restroom, but before she dies, she is saved by an alert policeman and Daryl is put away for life.  Because of this vicious attempt on her life, An agoraphobic psychologist and a female detective must work together to take down a serial killer who copies serial killers from the past. Helen becomes frightened to step out of her apartment for anything.  She has become agoraphobic and trusts few people, except her openly gay assistant.<br /><br />About a year after her attack, she sees a string of killings in the news that she knows are the working of a serial killer.  She calls the police station several times and is treated like a kook.  Holly Hunter plays a detective that has no leads except Helen's expertise inside a killer's mind.  They team up and begin a strange partnership to take down a copycat serial killer.  He is a genius that uses his talent to mimic famous murders from the past.<br /><br />Very exciting and worth the watch.

031237593X|5.0|This was one of those historical novels that immerses you in the time period, but even more importantly, created characters you cared about. We all know what happened to Richard, but we keep hoping it won't. I found myself reacting to what was going on in the pages of this book, which for me, takes a well written book to a new height.<br /><br />I am also happy to see the truth about the man and the reign of Richard II coming to light. The Tudor period, for obvious reasons had to vilify him. Penman and others with her, are finally setting that to rights and reeducating the mainstream public.
0439023513|5.0|Hunger Games captivated me. Catching Fire, not so much, but still liked it. Mockingjay stayed more present moment (not so many flashbacks) and, for the most part, moved in not so predictable directions. There was only one short section where my interest waned, which happened more frequently in the other two books (again, flashbacks). Some of Katniss's speeches in the first half of the book had an emotional impact and gave me chills. Katniss is clearly a fallible character, and at times a bit too cold and calculating, but remained strong and human throughout this book. I was annoyed with the love triangle in the second book but felt satisfied with its resolution in Mockingjay.<br /><br />I had a hard time visualizing some of the scenery in the end game but it didn't deter me. As I neared the end, I was afraid the ending was going to become a cliffhanger when Snow appeared to sway Katniss's opinion of the final bombing. I could feel myself winding up the scream NO! But, the ending was final. It didn't blow me away, but I was satisfied. I suppose their vote to extend the Hunger Games left the door open for another book. All right, but that scene seemed out of place, especially since it echoed the exact regime they just overthrew. Whatever. And the epilogue wasn't really necessary. Kind of an afterthought. Would've been better without it.

1600243916|3.0|Summary: The subtitle is \\"The Story of Success\\".  Unfortunately, it could have been SO much more than it turns out to be.  If you're going into this book thinking you'll get tips or learn the secrets on how you too can become a success save your money or get it from the library.  In fact, the author's main point is that you can't truly be a 'Bill Gates', the Beatles or some other captain of industry without repeated good fortunes of which you have no control.  Hard work is minimized in favor of the importance of your culture and family background (going back hundreds of years), birth place, birth year (this is a BIG point of the book), and other things that you have no control over.  I absolutely agree that these things are important to success, but not to the exclusion of other factors (ex. talent) that affect it too.<br /><br />The good: Gladwell has many great and entertaining examples and stories of how opportunities were presented to people who took them, and how sometimes it's just dumb luck of the draw that any particular person is made a successful 'outlier'.  His discussions of the effects on culture on a person are convincing.  The author also makes some good points about just how much 'luck' is involved in getting to the top, but that's his main point.  The discussion on Asian culture (number counting, rice paddies and airplane cockpit hierarchy) and the 'culture of honor' in the South was very engaging.<br /><br />The bad: The main point of the book, which is heavily browbeaten at the end, isn't how the successful truly have to work hard (that idea is given out in little snippets here and there in the book).  It doesn't really highlight what the successful have done in their careers, and how you can do it too.  Instead, it's largely a tome on how success is really just a function of the collective society, and how it takes a village to get to the top.  To paraphrase the author, success is 'less about talent and more about opportunities'.  The only reason he might appear to make that point is that he choses to mostly ignore the  talent and focus only on the opportunities.  Gladwell tries to make the case that rugged individualism as a major driver in success is barely even worth considering.  Individualism is a distinctly American point of view I guess; the author is not surprisingly from Canada*.<br /><br />I went into this book thinking that it would be a treatise on a) the circumstances that add up to making a person successful and b) getting some ideas on how I can do it too.  I did get some ideas on the circumstances that I can control (ex. getting 10000 hours of practice to master a complex task, the importance of keeping my kids intellectually engaged, and you don't have to be a genius - only \\"smart enough\\").  Also, I thought the discussion of what makes up 'meaningful work' was enlightening.  However, this book could have been so much more.  I admit I was disappointed by the end.  It turned out to be an anti-success book.<br /><br />* Not that there's anything wrong with that.  &lt;grin>to make that point is that he choses to mostly ignore the  talent and focus only on the opportunities.

0385737955|2.0|I really wanted to love this book.  I met James Dashner at a writing conference once.  He seemed like a really amiable guy, with a good sense of humor.  I read the first book in the 13th Reality series and didn't love it, but I was quite willing to give him another shot.  Especially because the premise of the Maze Runner is fascinating.  Sadly, while this review does make me feel rather traitorous, I have to say that  the execution of the concept failed on many levels.  There are a lot of good things about the book, but they don't quite make up for  the flaws.    THE GOOD:    1.  The idea is fantastic.  2.  The ending of the book is a total slap in the face (in a good way).    3.  Chuck, Minho, Newt, and Alby were likeable enough.   4.  The mystery of the book is enough to stop readers from putting the book down until the very end, and it is suspenseful to keep you on edge throughout the duration.    5. James Dashner has created a very vivid well written dystopian world that's really quite fascinating.      THE BAD:    1. James Dashner has a horrible habit of treating fairly obvious things like they are mysteries.  He tends to foreshadow and suspensefully lead up to these big reveals toward the end of the novel that sound like they're going to be a major turning point, and then the main character is like 'I've figured it out! We have to throw the ring into Mount Doom!' and then all of the characters react to this like it's mind blowing, all while the reader is thinking... \\"Well of course you have to throw the ring into Mount Doom.  Gandalf said that was the only way to destroy the ring....In like the first chapter, and there hasn't been a single alternate option given\\" while they bury their faces in their palms.  The 13th Reality had the same problem.  It's condescending and rather ridiculous to assume that readers won't even come to obvious conclusions on their own, and ruined the book.      2. The lead characters are very one dimensional.  Thomas is completely atypical young adult lead, and I quickly began to care more about what happened to his friends than what happened to him. I thought that his amnesia would make him interesting, but that wasn't really explored as much as it should have been  Sure he was given other special privileges that none of the other characters were, but that doesn't do anything for his likeability or do anything to help round him out better.  Honestly, Thomas could have died at the end, and I probably wouldn't have cared much.    3. It didn't feel like the author fulfilled every promise the book made.  The book seemed to promise that the maze was fascinating, and intricate, and filled with all kinds of horrifying creatures.  I was quite disappointed by how simple the maze turned out to be.  The puzzle was interesting, but the overall maze with only moving walls and one horrifying creature didn't live up to my expectations.      4. The slang was over-emphasized, crude, and wince worthy.  The few 9 year old boys that it would appeal to are usually too busy frying insects and making up underwear knock knock jokes to read.    Overall, I'd say skip this one, but read the Wikipedia synopsis. That will give you all of the good content in less time than you spent reading this review.
B000002BYD|5.0|This 98' album is arguably one of Pearl Jam's best, or at least among the top two studio albums on the long list of Pearl Jam records.  Yield in general a more softer and reflective rock n' roll album containing the following songs that concerts show have stood the test of time and became timeless musical jems: Given to Fly, Wishlist, Do the Evolution, MFC, Low Light, In Hiding, All Those Yesterdays.  It is worth getting the entire CD instead of downloading the individual songs because, you get the and lyrics and art pictures inside the CD.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|Do not buy this DVD if you are interested in the special features listed on the box and at the Amazon site. This DVD does not contain the making of, the deleted scenes or the audio commentary. The special features contain only trailers for 4 other movies. The movie is great, but the main reason I bought the DVD was to watch the making of. This false advertisement was a complete disappointment.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Yes, true...A Thousand Suns has lost the Linkin Park angst we've all heard in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but the making of music has to be an ongoing progression, or a development, whichever it may be. People change, people grow, same goes for the way musicians make music. Try listening to it without the preconceptions that it is a Linkin Park album, expecting heavy guitar riffs and screaming vocals. Considering they're all well into their 30s, their main demographic would've changed instead of the ones in 2000s being 15 to 20 year olds. it might do you a lot of good to just appreciate the music itself. Prefer the old albums? Well, you'll always have Hybrid Theory and Meteora. No band in the world can please everyone, musicians make music for themselves, music they enjoy playing/experimenting with not for anyone else for that matter. Only through that, that they get respected by their peers and fans alike. Personally I love it for what it is, so did I with Minutes to Midnight (my only gripe with ATS, it would be better with more Chester on vocals. no offense to mike). Don't be a hater, walk away from it if you dislike it, at the end of the day, it's just music, good or bad, we all have to go to work on Mondays.

0525951652|1.0|I really enjoy Follett novels but I won't be reading this one. I didn't buy a Kindle to pay the full price of publishing  a book.  This is happening more and more and it's very disapointing.

B000002OYB|4.0|I love the album.    But I am curious why there are two different versions of the cover. The American release (\\"Neighborhood\\") is inferior, in my opinion, to the UK release (\\"Neighbourhood\\").

0060558121|5.0|This is the third book I've read by Neil Gaiman and it is the most epic of his works so far and the novel left a profound effect on me. This is an original, intelligent, thought-provoking, and well-structured novel as well as serving as a mythology guide.<br /><br />American Gods is a reinterpretation of mix of myths and mythologies from Greek, Norse, African, and Asian pantheons. There are pagan gods, Native American folklore, Celtic Faery lore. This novel explores the many gods of both Heaven and Hell by juxtaposing the past and the present of immigrants who migrated to America, bringing their various myths and legends to the New World. These old gods were eventually forgotten as they were replaced with new gods of science and technology.<br /><br />The story centers around a man called Shadow who has just been paroled from a three year stint in prison for assaulting two men. He is released two days early because his wife has died in a car crash and he needs to make funeral arrangements.  On the plane to his wife's funeral, Shadow meets a strange man on the airplane, Mr. Wednesday, who offers Shadow a job which he reluctantly accepts. As these two embark on a road trip across the America, Shadow is introduced to a plethora of interesting, mysterious, and fascinating characters who turn out to be forsaken old Gods, trapped here in America, forgotten by the immigrants who brought them, in their minds, to this country long ago.<br /><br />This book is truly an epic urban fantasy and Neil Gaiman has done a incredible job of juxtaposing the past and the present, mixing and matching past legends and loredoms, which are the foundation of beliefs in this country. American Gods is a vivid and surreal journey into magic, mythos, and mystery. It's absolutely brilliant.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|It's been impossible to listen to this album separate from the context of Lennon's death for the past 30 years, and in many ways it still is.  But if the \\"Stripped Down\\" version doesn't exactly reclaim the album (it is, after all, a collection of pop songs meant as a snapshot in time, not the valedictory artistic statement fate turned it into), the warmth and immediacy of the remix definitely unyokes it from the time and place of it's making and turns it into an album for the ages. For me, it's less about what's missing here, or what's been changed there, but that the whole overall feel of the album, and specifically the presence of Lennon's voice, is more direct and impactful.  So, if it's not a revelatory rediscovery of the music, it's definitely the better version of the album, and the one I'll be listening to.
0061091480|5.0|if you are ready this book from the very beginning till the end will make sense,an amazing approach to life..life is a beautiful fun journey!!!,worry,guilt,complaining,fairness are all irrelevant,live and enjoy!!thanks dwyer your visions are amazing!!
B003W5C0VW|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and have always craved a legitimate release and here it is. I will purchase this but it really needs a cd companion to go with it. I'd really love to crank up this fantastic live set of the Stones at their peak (God I miss Mick Taylor) while rolling down the highway. Hopefully we won't have to wait years for the cd like we did when Bowie finally released the wonderful Reality tour dvd as a two cd set. I know I can't be alone in this.
1439181780|4.0|This book claims that the reader doesn't have to have read the Secret to benefit from the Power, and that's somewhat true. The Power is in many ways a refresher course in the Law of Attraction. Having read the Secret will help the reader grasp the concepts in the Power more easily, but the message of the Secret is retaught in a new package, with positive feelings being re-labeled \\"love\\". It's core message is one that anyone can benefit from, skeptic or not. The message in this book helps the reader to improve self-esteem and mental health and to become open to receiving the good things that life has to offer. To gain the full impact of the message, the reader should read the Secret (or watch the video), but for those who've read the first book and put it on a shelf, filing the lessons learned in a dusty filing cabinet of the mind, this is a great reminder and refresher course. Regardless of what skeptics and pessimists may say, we can all use a reminder of the messages in this book.

0439023491|5.0|I finished this book last night into the wee hours.....I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Revolution is coming....and Katniss has been picked as the catalyst for this revolution.<br /><br />This book has a very similar taste to it as Hunger Games did.  The characters are mostly the same, and the plot continues to center around the Capital and their desire to control, manipulate, and punish the districts.  I don't want to give away too much, so I'll be brief.<br /><br />The thing I like about these books is the first person narrative.  We see things through Katniss's eyes, and she is a very perceptive girl!  The whole Katniss/Gale/Peeta love triangle is in full force, but there is so much more to this book besides a simple love triangle.  This is a story about war.  It's a story about survival and the survival of loved ones.  It's about good vrs. evil, but it's also about human nature and all the gray in between the black and white.  It is a complete page turner.  Each chapter gives way to the next, and before you know it you've read the last line if the book.<br /><br />There is the infamous cliffhanger at the end, and even though I was expecting it.....that didn't make it any easier.<br /><br />Mockingjay has gotten VERY mixed reviews, but I'm commited now and will be eagerly waiting for Mockingjay to make it's way into my hands!
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Penelope is like a movie from my childhood memories. It has all the qualities the fairy-tales have, yet it's sprinkled with the realities of life. It pretty much makes me happy, as well as gives me the feeling that I can impact the world for the better.<br />So, I liked it.
B00000IQW5|4.0|Great movie, but it should be available in \\"anamorphic\\" or \\"enhanced for widescreen tv\\" format for today's 16x9 widescreen HDTV.  Better yet, how about a widescreen Blu ray edition?  To view the current 1:85.1 aspect ratio DVD properly on HDTV (filling the entire screen) I have to set the HDMI DVD player on \\"480P\\" and use the \\"full\\" screen setting.  Furthermore, I must adjust the HDTV itself to \\"zoom\\" and reduce the \\"sharpness\\" setting to about level 3 to keep the picture from being too grainy.  Call me a sentamentalist, perhaps that is what I am but I like this movie.  As a single, straight male I have always dreamed of having a loving relationship with a woman, but this dream has always eluded me. I guess that is why I find this story to be so beautiful.  However, until it becomes available on anamorphic wide screen or, better yet, Bluray I will not be purchasing it.  Come on Spielberg, get with it and release \\"Always\\" on anamorphic DVD and/or Bluray!
B003ZK58WM|3.0|This is a timely discussion to have.  One question is: Is this the right forum, ie market mechanics vs literary analysis ?   Since both are occurring, it appears the forum owner, Amazon, permits both.    The literary part is micro; it revolves around a book and an author, of which there are many.  The market mechanics discussion is macro and concerns future acceptance and use of ebooks.  On this I speak as a customer.    Ebooks have several plusses independent of literary worthiness that make me want to buy them.   These include:         Convenience and Portability ranging from ordering and receiving books instantly in a remote small town to easily carrying several on my plane trip.         Environmentally factors including fewer trees being used; how this is offset against the recycling of electronic devices I don't know.           Added value including dictionary lookup, links to reference material, type resizing etc.  (along with some inconveniences like bad formatting...,eff ects, diff erent, ).         Pricing, which up to now, has been lower than the alternate media, paper.    Speaking as a customer, I like low prices.  I don't like them so low that the company goes out of business, which makes the product unavailable.  On the other hand, I don't like them high enough to feel \\"goughed\\".  I also don't like price fixing, de facto (illegal) or de jure (common).    But in the end there is  need then want of the item vs the price.    Most of this discussion is about price and not value.  However, price, especially if perceived as \\"goughing\\" enters into value.  Right now the pricing model many of us believe in, the electronic book model,  (and is often touted under the name of \\"improved productivity\\") is put forward as a more effective cost for production and distribution, especially in regard to economics of scale. So the perception is that the customer is being \\"goughed\\" when customers are being charged the same price for ebooks (or more) as for paper.    The publishers are experimenting to find the right pricing.  This experiment can bring customer alienation.  Some are going out of business as they continue to use \\"the old model\\".  Some authors are skipping the entrenched publishing process.    Generally books are a want not a need.  It will be interesting to see if ebooks will be lower than paper in the future.  The future !  What paper books ?  What basis of comparison?      ps I had to rate this to join in the discussion, so I rated it as a 3, neutral.  I haven't read the book.  This takes us back to the first paragraph.  Perhaps Amazon should have a separate ebook forum.
0439023513|3.0|When I first started reading this series, I was obsessed.  I finished the fist two in one week and anxiously waited for the third to arrive.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book but i don't think it was as good as the previous two.  It was fairly dark, and pretty gory for my taste.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who gets too emotionally involved in books they read, it's not a happy book.  If you are okay with that kind of stuff then it is worth getting, I felt satisfied when i finished and I liked how it ended.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I join in the consumer outrage that a print publisher would charge more for a digital edition than a paper edition.  I sense that the conglomerate publishers need to learn a lesson, and having a book or three fail because of consumer backlash is probably the only way to get that message across to them.  In this case it's the Penguin Group (owner of Dutton); another is the Hachette Book Group, owner of Little, Brown & Company, who are currently selling the Kindle version of \\"Don't Blink,\\" by James Patterson and Howard Roughan for more than the hardcover.

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|This is one of those all too rare books that I hate.  It is a wonderful read, great story.  I am torn between wanting to read it as fast as possible but also I don't want to read it because then the story will end and I'll be left wanting more.  Damned if I do and damned if I don't.    Quite honestly one of the best series I have read this year.
B001WCN23W|5.0|A lot of folks don't seem to like this newest version due to the supposed poor remastering. Well, I don't own the 1994 Virgin version so I can't compare this to that but I do own the 1990 CBS version and this basically just sounds like that, only louder. Other than that the overall sound is cleaned up a bit and the bass and drums a bit more punchy.    Having said that, the reason I felt compelled to buy this (other than the fact that it is one of my favorite Stones LP's) is that on my iPod I have to crank up the CBS version to hear it well and that causes unwanted hiss and background noise. This UM version takes care of that problem and also more closely matches the levels of other recordings I have on my iPod giving a more consistent listen from album to album, especially when listening in my car. I think there are imperfections w/ the original recording and/or production that just may simply be more amplified here. Possibly Virgin did a better job w/ the '94 release of masking those imperfections or smoothing out the wrinkles so to speak.    As far as the actual music goes, this is one of the Stones' best in my opinion. \\"Brown Suger\\" was an instant classic upon it's original release and touches on one of the Stones' favorite subjects: sex! And in this case, somewhat taboo sex being that the object of desire is a woman of color. \\"Sway\\" is one of my very favorite Stones songs. One that I never tire of hearing. Mick Taylor is brilliant on this track w/ his tasteful slide solo in the middle and intense ripping on the outro. \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is another favorite. Mick just goes for it here. \\"Wild Horses\\" is absolutely beautiful w/ Keith's 12-string strumming. \\"Bitch\\" rocks. Another reviewer mentions how this remaster kind of made him rediscover \\"Sister Morphine\\" given the fact that this version really pops out of the speakers at you. I couldn't agree more. And Finally, \\"Moonlight Mile\\". I don't know what to say other that I really love this song. It's very intense and moving. A perfect way to round out the album.    I have to believe that it's releases like this one that help spawn and inspire the likes of the Black Crowes, Aerosmith and Guns 'n Roses. This is a great album and the remaster, although not perfect, does make the original better.

0736092269|5.0|I found this book to be so informative, especially when designing your own exercises to work specific muscles. Although I'm a qualified personal trainer, this book could be used by complete beginners to strength training. I may even buy the book specifically for women, as it seems to have a few more glute exercises in there (and who doesn't want to work on their glutes!)
0553805371|1.0|There is no information that is new in this book!  And the conclusion that the universe is created from gravity, that gravity can form something out of nothing, is absurd!  Where did the gravity come from?  Where did all the other little universes get their start from?  NOTHING has been answered, big waste of time.  A lot of filler, I think Hawking is grabbing at straws at the end of his life.

It's a science book that's written in a more readable form.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Like most people i didn't expect this album to sound as it did. On first listen i thought it was rushed and demo material at best. I loved silence from the first listen, but the rest was a harder sell. It is as different from old Portishead as i imagine you can get while still being Portishead. The more you listen to this album the more it grows on you. I am almost glad this isn't getting the fame the other albums did. This one really seems like it will age well. Their is some different musical concepts on this album which clearly seem a bit advanced for the average casual listener. Their previous material was so easy to get, this takes a bit more. Their is a clear influence from more electronic sources. You can hear influences, but in a way that isn't unoriginal, but more exciting than anything. This one is also much, much more dark, even the recording style is dark, which really sets the mood. Like i said before, initially it seems rushed but the more you listen, the more impressive it is. Honestly this is by far now my favorite Portishead album, after hearing them doing this it is actually hard to listen to the old stuff. Also most of the old stuff was sample based, so clearly it sounds more slick, this isn't, this was the real deal, real instruments and some of them are probably sounds that can never be perfectly reproduced again. Hopefully Portishead won't go and disappear again, it would be a real shame to the music world if this stops here.
B001684L0A|5.0|As a historical buff, I was thrilled when HBO announced the production of this movie. Giamotti and Linley are excellent, as expected. The feel of the movie really captures how hard life was at those times. Whats surprising, is the underlying love story.... who knew that our 2nd president was such a hardcore, hopeless romantic!
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I had very high hopes for this watch, as I had the predecessor (the 305). I primarily bought this watch because I was looking for a sleeker profile, and the enhanced calorie calculation. While I can certainly admit that the two features I wanted are nice, the bezel on this watch mitigates anything good it offers. Seriously, it is that messed up. I saw the reviews that warned about the bezel control. But then, I saw a few that said it wasn't that big of a problem. Maybe it isn't for them, but I can say that the bezel is a HUGE problem for me.    Changing between functions on this watch requires that one makes his/her selection using the bezel. It is supposed to be touch-sensitive. It even has a setting for the sensitivity. Alas, the sensitivity is little more than eye candy. I can be in the middle of a run, and look down at the watch, and it has arbitrarily moved from one function to another on it's own. Depending on where it is, it isn't often as simple as touching the bezel again to get it back to the screen I desire. Sometimes, the watch ends up in a menu that requires a long touch of the bezel...somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-5 seconds. Other times, It refuses to do anything. Still other times, it buffers each touch...so it switches screens, back to the original, back to the other, etc.--commensurate with the number of times it was touched when it was \\"hung.\\"    For a casual runner, this might not be a problem. But for people who want to have an ability to track progress (distance), time, heart rate, calorie burn throughout the run, it's a pain. It is particularly frustrating on a treadmill (which I am forced to use when I travel), and running at a relatively fast pace (12.5 km/h). Having to look down at the watch while trying to figure out how to get it back to where it should be distracts one from the primary goal of remaining balanced while on the treadmill.    The positives of the watch are the number of data points one can monitor, and its ability to upload the data to a computer. I also really like the foot pod, and soft-strap heart rate monitor. (Both sold separately; the watch comes with a rigid heart rate strap.)
B003L1ZWG2|3.0|Frozen has a very neat idea, a few sequences of genuine suspense, okay acting, but ultimately it runs a little thin by the end. Three young people get trapped in a ski lift because some idiot workers don't care enough to pay attention. They are left high above the ground in below freezing temperatures, with full knowledge the resort will be closed during the week. Guess what? It's Sunday night! Nooooooo!!! Think of Open Water, but instead of sharks, we get a very hungry pack of wolves. It's far from great, but it's probably Adam Green's most complete work, though Hatchet and Hatchet II have moments of goodness. It's worth a rental on a cold fall or winter night.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and sounds good, but I've seen better. There is also a series of interesting featurettes that run as long as the actual film.
B0000048CX|5.0|This is an absolutely flawless collection of covers. I know this album is not a favorite of the Yo La Tengo faction that prefers the noisier and more \\"adventerous\\" side of the band's musical output, but it would be nonsense to dismiss this album ... and very shortsighted. There is majesty and grace and charm in all of these songs. Play this CD for a quick pick-me-up after a bad day. And sing along if you want. Pure joy.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I was just looking for a way to kill some time today and saw that most critics gave Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World positive reviews. I expected nothing more than mild entertainment, like my mindset when seeing The Expendables, but I left the theater with a surprise thought in my head. I have seen 35 movies in theaters so far this year, but the one I just walked out of is my second favorite, behind only Inception. I didn't expect that at all. It probably helped that the audience I saw it with was very vocal in the laugh department and that's always a plus when watching a comedy. I can't remember the last time I laughed as much at the movies. The dialogue and editing are very clever, but it's all the visual gags that take it beyond anything I've ever seen. Whether it's all the video game related music and concepts, or the Seinfeld theme, followed by a scene with a laugh track coming out of nowhere, it never stops thinking of new ways to make you smile in awe of it. To make a great thing even better, it also pulls off the action element and a minor romantic angle for the ladies. The fight scenes are creative and unique, and they even found room to throw in a few original rock tunes.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Michael Cera fan, mainly because he's always acts the same, though I do admit that nobody can play a dork like him. His timing and delivery is excellent and he even had me believing in Michael Cera the action star by the end. This is easily my favorite role of his. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was another bit of perfect casting. She even managed to look good in all three of her crazy hair colors. Kieran Culkin got more than his share of laughs as Cera's gay roommate. All of the other supporting players (Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, Anna Kendrick and Jason Schwartzman being some of the big names) from top to bottom were amazing, without a single weak link.<br /><br />Writer/Director, Edgar Wright, of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame, got nearly everything right with this mini-masterpiece. You don't have to be a gamer to enjoy it, but it will sure make you appreciate it that much more. I guess I'm gonna have to make some room in my Blu-ray collection for this baby.erpiece.

B001NOAJVW|4.0|I just rode 5000km with this mirror. Overall I was quite pleased with it (until it broke), particularly after a poor experience with a mirror that mounted around the brake mount.    Pros:  1. It doesn't break when the bike falls over.  2. Generally get a good view behind and it moves with your head so it's easy to scan a wider rear area.  3. It sticks out quite far forward so that you can actually see the mirror without straining eyeballs.  4. various adjustments ensure you can fit it to your line of vision.  5. I like the velcro attachment which is stuck to the foam on the inside of the helmet which allows you to take the mirror off when you take your helmet off (a good idea to store it somewhere it's not going to get stepped on)  6. once adjusted, the mirror does not shake loose; it is very good at staying where you put it through bumps and wind.  7. One doesn't have to look away from the road for long nor move one's eyes very far.    Cons  1. the view is not great due to the small reflective area  2. it will shake around some (but not on a smooth road) thus blurring the image.  3. if you break a part, you have to replace the whole thing (spare parts not available)  4. it broke (a small plastic part) on the last day of my tour (I tossed my helmet on top of my panniers overnight and things shifted).  5. it costs way too much for what it is, but that is the case with every bike mirror I've seen. I passed other cyclists who were very happy with duck tape and a cheap car mirror ($6).
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  For Women that want to know that you are not alone, other women have the same experiences, but others get to go out there and fulfill there desires.  I would recommend this book.  Loved it, I got it on my PC Kindle, want it on hard cover now so I can share it with others.  The Kindle download was very reasonably priced and I enjoyed it!!!
B000T0XEGS|5.0|It is a beautiful production of a  wonderful opera. Zefirelli es a genius. For us La traviata is Verdi´s best opera. Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo are wonderful singers and extraordinary actors. What else can we say? A pure delight!  Pedro and Judie López, San Antonio, TX.

B00136Q2KW|4.0|Well, I'm just your average music lover but I thought I'd add my Op here for good reason.  I may have been one of the few people who actually bought this album when it came out and listened the hell out of it in the 90's.  I have to say that I haven't heard it in over ten years due to the fact that I originally purchased it on tape (yep, that's what I said, tape) and haven't owned or seen a tape player in as long a time.  Now browsing through amazon and hearing these songs again, I can say they are as powerful now as then.  I still love the songs and his voice, so amazing. I love that voice, it's a shame it was wasted on so much pop.  Well, he's not dead so I guess there's always a chance for something great still to come.  Anyway, the songs made their way back into my life via MP3 and I'm happy about it.

0439023521|5.0|I just finished it and with out a doubt it was the fastest book I have read. I had to know what was going to happen next every moment was thrilling and breath taking. I never knew what to expect next, somethings hit me like a ton of brick and others left me wanting to know why. I laughed, I cried, and I chewed off my finger nails. It was brutal and bloody and yet I never lost my sympathy for the main character.
0525951652|4.0|Sure is disconcerting that by protesting the price of the kindle version, folks are bringing down the ratings of the actual book. I mistakenly have used the Amazon star system to judge the actual quality of the author's product not what readers think the price of the book or pray tell the price of purchasing the kindle version.    Maybe other sites will give a better representation

0061433047|5.0|This is the book I want my daughter to read. Yes, my son too - and of course my wife and I both loved it.<br /><br />It is, however, most especially a book for young women. Please do buy a copy for nieces, daughters and so on.<br /><br />Pratchett brings many beloved characters in for brief cameos, including one of my favorites -- a priest of Om who died long before Tittany's time. No, he doesn't time travel -- but someone else does.<br /><br />You might think then that someone would need to read Tiffany's other books to understand this one. Not so. Pratchett is in superb form. He manages to tell a tale that stands on its own, while still weaving in the characters and stories we love.<br /><br />There is nothing that disappoints. Yes, there is one aspect of the ending that is indulgent and could have been dropped, but I'm glad he left it in. [1]<br /><br />Thank you Terry!<br /><br />[1] Update: on further reflection, the ending is a better fit than I'd first thought. There's a fairy tale circle that must be closed, and Terry found a novel way to say \\"a life lived well ever after\\".

In all honesty, I probably would have never read this book had it not been required for me to read in my college class where we had to do lit circles. I just can't seem to ever put this book down and just the other day, I ordered \\"Angels and Demons\\" by Dan Brown because I can't get enough!!

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I have not read it yet, and I won't until the price is $9.99.  Amazon cannot bait and switch us and keep its customers.  If the publisher is demanding too much for the book, its likely that they hadn't read it before they bought it.  The reviews so far are awful.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Director Jon Favreau continues to excel with Marvel's new superhero franchise in the exciting blockbuster sequel \\"Iron Man 2\\". With the world now aware of his secret, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is determined to ensure that his Iron Man technology doesn't fall into the wrong hands, despite the countless pressures from the US government to turn over his technology for military application. If knowing that his personal arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body wasn't bad enough, Stark must also deal with the vengeful scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and the greedy industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). \\"Iron Man 2\\" delivers everything that one would expect for a big Summer blockbuster sequel. Though it does fall short of the original, many of the key elements are still present in the sequel, and it definitely offers a very good dose of exciting action and impressive special effects. Robert Downey Jr. continues to dominate the role of Tony Stark. The cast also includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man 2\\" is one of this year's biggest movies, and Paramount certainly delivers a standout fully-loaded 3-disc presentation that ranks as one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year. The blockbuster sequel is presented in a 2.35:1 HD format. The picture quality is excellent and its DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound is certainly amazing. Among special features, it includes a commentary track by director Jon Favreau, the four-part documentary \\"Ultimate Iron Man: The Making of Iron Man 2\\", 6 behind-the-scenes featurettes (Creating Stark Expo, Practical Meets Digital, Illustrated Origin: Nick Fury, Illustrated Origin: Black Widow, Illustrated Origin: War Machine & Working With DJ AM), picture galleries, trailers and 8 deleted scenes. Overall, \\"Iron Man 2\\" scores an \\"A-\\".
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I starts out fast paced and stays that way. not only fast paced but i couldn't wait for what was coming next. ms. collins put it all together very well and i can't wait to read the second and third. katniss and peeta are wonderfully developed characters. all of them really were developed very nicely and the story just flowed. a very good futuristic suspense that should make us all think about the \\"capital\\" controling everything. you won't be sorry with this one!!!

0439023483|3.0|I have a high respect for the way the writer built the story's concept and flaw.

B003DZX44I|5.0|Disney has really outdone themselves.  I cannot count how many times I've watched Beauty and the Beast, but watching this new HD transfer was like seeing it for the first time.  Actually, it was better than that, because this is an entirely new experience.  If you have any appreciation for the art of animation you'll be watching this movie with your jaw dropped open the whole time.  I never would have guessed how much vivid color and sound quality was lost in the standard definition releases, but it was huge.  Finally all the work and effort Disney animators put into this film is available for all to see.  You'd be silly to miss it.

159102594X|3.0|If you go into \\"The Blade Itself\\" expecting the second coming of A Song of Ice and Fire, you'll be disappointed. But this says more about the quality of Song than any deficiencies of \\"The Blade Itself.\\" It's just not a fair comparison, as A Song of Ice and Fire is on an entirely different level than pretty much anything out there.     This was the mistake I made with \\"The Blade Itself.\\" I expected too much. On its own, it's an OK novel that left me wanting to read the next book in the series. So \\"The Blade Itself\\" was, at the very least, successful in this respect. But that's the problem, too. The book ends up feeling entirely like setup for the second book (and I assume the rest of the trilogy). And we're talking a whole bunch of setup here, nearly 400 pages worth, which leaves about 125 pages of substantial story. These concluding chapters are outstanding; it's just a shame that it took so much effort to get there.    Looking back, I'm glad I had the patience to finish \\"The Blade Itself.\\" Looking forward, I hope the second and third books can continue the momentum of those last 125 pages...

B001DF68MA|5.0|Love this bike seat!  Our one year old adores his bike rides - he even hums as dad pedals!  It is very comfortable and easy to install.  The only slight issue is that the shoulder straps don't always stay put.  We had to make them pretty tight, other than that it is fantastic!  My husband did a ton of research on these seats and compared other brands, this seat met all our needs!  It also had the best weight capacity (our son is on the heavier side) so we will be able to use it for a longer time. LOVE IT!
B0044430H8|3.0|It goes without saying that over the back half of the previous decade and leading into this one, Trent Reznor has been a pretty busy dude, a fact that is especially interesting when you consider the lengthy pace he worked at previous to this. Over the past five six years, Reznor released four records under his most well known project, Nine Inch Nails, before going on hiatus with it, than proceded to get married, put out a mediocre EP with his new group, How To Destroy Angels, and score the latest David Fincher picture \\"The Social Network\\", which is what this project is.   Now the tell tale sign of any good score or soundtrack is simply this: does it work well on it's own? The music they provided for the film works perfectly with the vibe and flow of the film and should be an Oscar contender at the end of the year. As far as the music on it's own? Well, that's more of a tough call.  I have always been a huge fan of Reznor's instrumental work, even being a slight fan of \\"Ghosts I-IV\\", a good project that could have used a little editing. And that's essentially what you get here at the end of the day\\": \\"Ghosts\\" in annotated form.  The songs here are all ambient keyboards and sparse piano melodies with a few driving keyboard bleep songs to move along the pace. There is nothing here that is bad, though nothing here that is brilliant either. Like \\"Ghosts\\", it is interesting background music for your house or car, but doesn't offer a whole lot if you want to sit and listen closely with your headphones.  At this point in their collobration, Atticus Ross (the 12 Rounds musician who has been working closely with ol' Reznor since \\"With Teeth\\") have developed a certain sound that they obviously like sticking to. This fits well with \\"Ghosts I-IV\\" and How To Destroy Angels, and depending on how much you like those projects will show you how much you will enjoy \\"The Social Network\\" soundtrack. The music works perfectly in the context of the film, and alone it is pleasant background noise, never brilliant, never bad.

Austen made her characters so tridimensional I was amazed...not many writers arecapable of that.<br />When it comes down to Mr.Darcy, I was extremely satisfied with him as well, and every time I read a scene with him and Elizabeth  , I giggled at their witty replies to each other, they most definitely made me swoon.<br /><br />Learned from this.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I've loved vampires for a long time, since Anne Rice first introduced them to me in Interview with the Vampire. She was great in her day. Most recently True Blood and Twilight are both so terribly awful that I wondered what I ever found interesting about vampires in the first place. THEN, The Vampire Diaries totally reminded me about all that I loved and had forgotten. I LOVE this show! I have just marathoned season one and plan to go again as soon as I can get my sister onboard. I can't believe I did not give this show a chance last fall. The pilot just did not appeal to me. It was too Twilight. But soon into the first disc, the show quits being about high school and vampires. Sure there are vampires and Elena and her friends are still in high school, but it is much more about this fascinating town, Mystic Falls. I love the vampire nuances specific to this universe. I love ALL the characters. I love the mystery and suspense. I have not been this excited about a show in years.
B003FXXNBW|5.0|im a fan of undisputed movies.i liked the first movie, i liked the second movie and i loved the third movie. i own the blu ray and well dont expect too much about the picture but it fits all your screen and also the sound is great. the action about the movie is really outstanding. i really so recomend this movie but if you haven't seen the other 2 first movies. i truly suggested to see the other movies so you understand the trilogy.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|It is unconscionable to price the Kindle edition above the Hardcover price.  I will not buy this book in any format while this price structure is in place.  I have enjoyed several of Follett's books and would have bought this one had he and his publisher shown a modicum of restraint.

B003KUSUG8|3.0|I have enjoyed all of Eminem's past works, as he has a way with words, is a bona fide Detroit street poet, comes up with some very clever rhyme schemes, and lays his feelings on the platter.  Sometimes he's been angry, yes, he has run the gamut of emotions and he has not been at all shy about sharing them.  But this one is just a little TOO angry.  I just didn't feel like listening past the first two songs.  So it was disappointing, like, \\"Dude, you're not over your sh-- yet????  What have YOU got to be angry about???? You're rich and famous.  wtf?\\"  It's my own fault, really.  I had loved all his other albums, so I didn't pre-listen to the cuts on this one.  Bought the car without kicking the tires. From now on, I will be sure to look under the hood and avoid buying a lemon.

It's actually turned me off to their ice cream.

B002G1K82Q|5.0|What a wonderful movie! Loved it
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar is one of the most creative movies I have ever seen.  The real star of this movie is the planet of Pandora, inhabited by fifteen foot tall, blue humanoids and a wonder full array of exotic plants and animals.  I think that James Cameron surpasses George Lucas, when it comes to creating an other world environment.  The plot is really simple.  People of Earth have discovered a rare mineral on Pandora, and they are willing to destroy the natives' land to get it.  It reminds one of the westward advance of the Europeans against the native Americans.  It is a bit romantic in that Mr. Cameron portrays the native Pandorans as noble savages, while the miners from Earth are totally evil.  It is hard to judge the acting performances, because the special and visual effects make it hard to determine what is acting and what is effects.  In my opinion Zoe Saldana deserves credit.  Behind the cat-like face, the yellow eyes, and the tall, blue body she is somehow able to bring her character to life more effectively than the other Na Vi.  I enjoyed seeing Stephen Lang, who portrayed Gen. George Pickett in the movie Gettysburg, in a starring role.  Astronomers are saying they have discovered a planet that may have earth like qualities.  I for one hope that if we ever get there we will find Pandora.

I had seen my own dad work so hard, while I have seen few relatives simply sit at home, chat, but having lavish lifestyle. I was told that hard work equals money and even returning early from work as scorned off as avoiding work.<br /><br />In Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert explains it lucidly and clearly demystifies all the truth about money. He explains the way the Rich look at the money which in turn gives them more control of their life and value from money.<br /><br />Robert gives clear diagrammatic presentation how how money should be categorized to understand the flow of money.<br /><br />Its one the eye opener book that needs to be incorporated as text book. Its simple and very thought provoking. I have read almost all books written by Robert, and this is the foundation of all of his books.
B00008K7AM|4.0|Attractive girls, hijinks and hair removal, this movie has it all :)    I saw this a few years ago, and my husband and I liked it so much that I bought it for our anniversary. Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore) produced movies are as usual as silly as they can be. This one, however, elicited many laughs from my husband and I, and we usually don't like overly silly movies. This one, however, was not, and has a moral: You learn how to treat people and what is really important, as the girl was popular in her high school and treated others who weren't in her clique badly. It turns out that when things went bad, it was them she needed to get through it. There's a few relationships in the movie that need tweaking, which adds the conflict films need to work. I did like the relationship between her and her brother, who is going to be probably one of the best female impersonators when he grows up :)Watch for the scene where after the switch, she tries to do the same seductive action at the mall, this time as a man, and the dance club scene.    The Hot Chick takes the Freaky Friday switch and made it work. This is just one review, see The Hot Chick and draw your own conclusions!
B0034G4P7G|3.0|The central premise of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that Facebook emerged not from an attempt by a college kid to connect with his friends, as the origin myth has it, but from a misogynist online prank.  The title speaks to the profound irony underlying this almost accidental invention: The man who created the world's largest and most successful social network is devoid of social intelligence.<br /><br />This image of the world's youngest billionaire is far from pretty. But it's not just Mark Zuckerberg (well acted by Jesse Eisenberg) that Social Network lampoons. Harvard University comes across as a hornet's nest of elitism, greed, and misogyny. It's hard to sympathize with anyone here, except perhaps Eduardo Saverin, presented as Zuckerberg's only friend, whom he betrays.<br /><br />Saverin's sympathetic portrayal owes to the fact that he was the only person connected with Facebook to consult with Ben Mezrich, author of the 2009 book, [[ASIN:0307740986 The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal]] from which the film is adapted.<br /><br />The central plot device is flash-forwards to Zuckerberg's testimony at a legal deposition. He is being sued by both Saverin and Harvard twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who claim he stole their creative idea. (Zuckerberg settled both lawsuits out of court; Saverin now owns 5  percent of the privately held company, while the Winklevosses got $65 million.)<br /><br />Despite the obvious distortion of the deposition scenes (in real life, everyone involved in a lawsuit does not sit around a big table inserting commentary while a witness is being deposed), the device works not only to anchor the flashbacks but also to remind the viewer of the film's essential accuracy.<br /><br />But, ironically, this film is far from accurate. Although many of the bizarre details are factual, several of the central elements are entirely fictional. Zuckerberg did not, for example, get dumped by a girlfriend. He now lives with the same woman he was dating before he launched Facebook. (If you are interested in a complete rundown of what's fact and what's fantasy, check out a column at The Daily Beast by veteran journalist David Kirkpatrick, author of the nonfiction book [[ASIN:1439102112 The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World]]. Also, the New Yorker's Jose Antonio Vargas recently profiled Zuckerberg in an article, \\"The Face of Facebook.\\")<br /><br />This shameless blending of fact and fiction that is so characteristic of Hollywood makes me uneasy. Are we watching a true story, or the bitter memories of a sore loser?<br /><br />Nonetheless, with its outstanding direction (by David Fincher), compelling script, and excellent acting, The Social Network is well worth seeing. And with the Facebook network now boasting more than 500 million active users worldwide, it's certainly interesting to ponder its socially disconnecting effect, a central irony of the digital age.man he was dating before he launched Facebook.

B002UNMWAG|4.0|If you like lots of shooting and killing then you will probably like this movie.  I think the first Boondock Saints movie was a little better, but this one was good too.  The only things I didn't care for in this movie were the flash forward scenes where the Saints would imagine how their plan was going to work.  It never worked like they thought it would so all that extra film was kind of a waste of time.  The ending tends to make you think there will be a third movie and if there is that should be enough.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|As noted in the most visible reviews, be sure to see the \\"us theatrical subtitled\\" version - luckily the correct version IS streaming from Amazon and Netflix.
0316044938|1.0|I didn't like this novel at all.    At the beginning, I found it interesting enough to continue reading. Needless to say, this was at the very beginning. I was determined to continue reading the book, seeing as I started it and there were so many people raving about it, that I thought it should get better.    It didn't.    The story drags along. And then, it hits a nonsensical point of no return. I remember when I came upon this point in the book, I almost threw the book down and actually said outloud, \\"SERIOUSLY? OH COME ON!\\"    I have no interest in reading any other books of the author. Her writing style is just not interesting at all.
0439023521|2.0|I mistakenly bought this based on the hundreds of positive reviews.  It is, however, kiddie lit.  Look for it at your local \\"mallmovie\\".  Not on any \\"best of\\" lists.
B002ZG99CM|2.0|This was a predictable remake with just enough newness added in to keep it from going straight to dvd.  The cinematography tries to fill in where the story falls short, but it should keep you from falling asleep (maybe).  Having the child of a celebrity power couple play the top bill in his maiden cinematic voyage comes across as the shameless pre-fabricated non-event that it is; a $200,000,000 birthday cake.  If I had that kind of budget, I would look pretty good too.  Some kid's parents buy them toys or clothes, but apparently young Smith's dad bought him a movie franchise.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies this year and Scott Pilgrim vs the World, in my opinion, is the best one yet. I bought all the books off of Amazon and fell inlove but I got worried about the movie because I was also a Last Airbender fan and was very dissapointed by that. Of all the book to movie films out there this is probably the most accurate, seeing that they had to do 5 books (I know there are 6 but the film was finished before the last book came out) in about 2 hours. Of course every fan will miss some of there favorite book scenes when it comes to Hoolywood versions but this is the first movie I think I've ever seen that wasn't a complete let down at all.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|This movie really is mindless Flash and expensive CGI, but still entertaining, but insulting to the original movie.  This could have been a great movie, but was turned into a popcorn flick that really lacks any essence.  Characters were so underdeveloped that the audience didn't get a chance to connect to the characters on an emotional level, leaving nothing but mind numbing action and special effects. This could have been another Great epic like Lord of the Rings, with an excellent storyline and well developed characters combined with great special effects. But instead lacked all the above, except the special effects.      The story was rushed from the beginning and didn't give much insight into why the mortals were so defiant to the gods. More emphasis should have been given to the Greek mythology behind the movie and the human like character flaws of the gods themselves.  The movie did not follow the original movie as closely as I hoped and threw in some really cheesey looking characters, such as the mutant Pinocchio looking jinn and the chucky cheese animatronic looking ferry boat man. The one and only comical scene through the entire movie: the wacky mechanical owl from the original movie was briefly pulled out of a bag by Perseus as he says \\"What is this?\\" Pegasus was displayed as a black rather than white flying stallion, which did not sit right with me. Guess the black horse reminded of the black wraths from Lord of the Rings..lol    In comparing this film with the 1981 version, the remake is nothing more than a plastic glitter coated hollywood version of the original, the characters seem two dimensional and the story is full of holes and does not flow.  But of course, the monsters are much more realistic than special effects from 29 years ago. But is that all that makes a good movie?, hardly..     I would say the blu-ray version of this movie is worth renting from redbox for $1.50, but don't waste your money buying it!  I would expect to see it in the Walmart $5 bin within a year..which is about what it is worth.

093183841X|5.0|A great book. A must for every collector -even the most amateurish one- of cameras. It has almost everything, it is full of valuable information, it follows a very consistent and fair system of evaluation. It is also a great fun just to go through its pages and illustrations. You should get it even if you only own two or three old cameras. It is such a pitty that a new edition is not in the horizon.

B00151HZME|5.0|Ok how do i start. Beautiful album. i just love this album i cant stop listening to it. They really have captured a sound that is uniquely there own. The music is different which was what kept me listening. After listening to the album front to back i went & bought all there CD's and haven't looked back. M83 is probably the best Electronica band out there and defiantly one of my favorite bands. This may sound weird but listening to this album in the Fall season just evokes a great feeling and emotion in me. wow just buy this CD!<br /><br />Best tracks:<br />You appearing<br />Kim & Jessie<br />Graveyard girl<br />Couleurs<br />We own the sky
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  It is a perfect introduction to Jane Austen for those of us who know pretty much nothing of dear Jane.  Although it may not be appealing to people who give themselves credit as an \\"expert\\" of what Jane Austen is all about AND it may not be the best adaptation of the book, it certainly made me want to read the book and compare.  I physically struggle with reading and to have something like this that made me want to read despite how uncomfortable it is for me, has to be something special.  Just from watching this movie, I have wanted to see other adaptations of Jane Austen books in films and do the same by following up with reading the actual story. I love Jonny Lee Miller and Romola Garai in this movie.  The music soundtrack is outstanding as well.
B003DZX3US|5.0|Disney's Beauty and the Beast has become the quintessential animated musical, chock full of moments that have become iconic -- even to the point of parody -- since its smash debut in 1991. It was the ultimate connection of consummate talents, some who were already legendary and many of which who have become industry giants.<br /><br />This is the first time in seven years that Beauty and the Beast has been issued on home video, this time in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo that kindly for DVD owners, still offers the superb audio commentary by producer Don Hahn, composer Alan Menken and directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and three versions of the film, as they appeared on the Platinum Edition.<br /><br />Once again, this Diamond Edition offers yet another reason to get a Blu-Ray Player if you want to see how great the digital restoration is in all its glory. (As far as I can tell, you can't buy the DVD without getting the Blu-ray discs as well.) If you want to see some new features such as an Alternate Opening, a Deleted Scene, new games, new documentary features and a new music video. You might want to hang onto your Platinum DVD because there are a few features, including some games, that do not appear on the new edition.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is one of those Disney classics that transcends its release date, the age of its audience and the tinge of its lesser imitators. Somehow it all works, and as the artists say themselves, even they didn't know whether it would all work but somehow it did. That's the fascinating, elusive nature of great artistry.

B0028RXHCG|4.0|I upgraded my PC cpu to the Intel Core2 Duo Processor E7600 to be able to run Parallels and multiple OS's.   The cpu installed easily and works great, however, I could not properly install the NIDEC cpu fan that came with it.  I tried to carefully follow the graphical procedure (no written instructions are provided) shown in the Booklet.  I aligned the four plastic inserts with the threaded holes on the motherboard, push down on each plastic cap to snap  the four corners in and then turned each cap 90 degrees to lock them.   Unfortunately, two caps did not and could not be locked in place.  I had to foreably remove the fan and use the original cpu fan (with locking screws) in its place.  I contact Intel(email) to get a replacement cpu fan, however, so far the only response I got was an email acknowledging that they will respond as soon as possible.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I really enjoyed this box set, it has all of the great hits and versions that were never released.  I like the DVD that came with this as well.  I also appreciated the communication from the seller letting me know that shipping was going to take longer then expected.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Linkin Park's new CD is brilliant, highly experimental and really, really, really different than anything they've ever done. I was listening to it the first time and I was shocked over and over again by the direction that LP has taken here and the album is really, really good.    You'll hear techno songs, aggressive German dance club music, a song that sounds like something that Imogen Heap would perform, and yes even an acoustic love song.    Linkin Park has taken their game to a new level and while they may lose fans becuase of it, they also seem like they are happy with the music that they have made.

0061433047|5.0|Terry Pratchett's latest, which continues the story of the Wee Free Men and the witch Tiffany, from Discworld.  This time she has to face \\"the cunning man\\" -- a truly evil spirit from the past, from the days of burning witches, which turns people against them through lies, hate, and rabble-rousing.     I LOVE disc world stories, and that is true of this one as well.  If you have never read one of the disc world books, and have a sense of humor, go ahead and buy the entire set.  I think there are less than 40 of them, and you will love every single one.  There are loads of interesting and unforgettable characters, and a lot of headology.  Witches are good at that.  :-)    \\"I shall wear midnight\\" is not a political book by any means, but it DOES show the view of witchcraft more from the perspective of witches.  It is also more historically accurate than what gets portrayed in the movies.     I take that back.  Perhaps I was mistaken in saying that it is not a \\"political\\" book.    This particular one concentrates on whatever it is which turns people into a mob intent on destroying a target group or individual by appealing to their prejudices, to the stories they have been told about others being \\"evil\\".  \\"The cunning man\\" from the story would be the equivalent of Glenn Beck, or Pat Robertson, or any of the others who operate purely on the principle of turning people rabidly against each other.     As such, it is really (unintentionally) political, and really timely.  It is a warning against being misled by people preaching hate and encouraging violence.  It even presents a number of instances where Tiffany herself was mistaken about the character of important people in the story.      The book includes hints to future stories, and I really hope I get the opportunity to read them.

0312600844|5.0|Whether you trust Oprah's recommendations or not, this is the book everyone over the age of 30 should probably read this year. Beautifully written, throughtful and thought-provoking, \\"Freedom\\" is hard to put down. The difficult choices the characters have to make as well as the emotional pain they inflict on each other are described with such finesse and force by Franzen, it's truly remarkable. I found myself marvelling at the ease with which the author manipulates the English language and the depth of his understanding of the complexities of human relationships. Touching, emotionally draining, intellectually challenging, \\"Freedom\\" is a book that makes an impression so deep, it's unlikely to ever be forgotten.

0061876747|4.0|This was my first time reading Boyd (thanks Stephen King for the suggestion) so I intitially thought this was going to be a serious thriller.  I was dissappointed the Adam character wasn't a stronger, more courageous protagonist.  But before too long, I realized that every character in this was just that- a character.  When examined from your own point of view, their eccentricities are at times pretty hilarious.  Sort of like a Carl Haissen novel- only less overtly humourous.  Even the hired killer has likeable, funny qualities.<br />I do agree that I could have done with a more complete ending.  Two pretty major situations are left unresolved.

0880793589|5.0|Reading the reviews of people who dislike this product, I'm getting the impression that they may not necessarily be using it in a way that optimizes its potential.  Yes, it's been more than a decade since I first received this product as a gift, and yes, for the past handful of years it's been mislocated, so I haven't been able to use it in the recent past.  However, when I did have it, I remember it being a curiously powerful tool for the purpose for which I specifically employed it - creative writing.  It helped me to develop some characters with traits and quirks that I definitely wouldn't have thought of on my own.  Perhaps the product isn't as useful in a corporate setting or for group brainstorming sessions, but it certainly pushes the individual imagination in different directions.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars (Peter Gene Hernandez) has been in a musical family, since birth. He has Philipino, Hawaiian and Puerto-Rican backrounds and his musical influence has spanned even wider.     He has co-written songs for  : K'naan (Waving Flag), Flo-Rida (Right Round), Adam Levine, Cee-lo (F*** You) and manyyyy more. Him and his producion team - The SMEEZINGTONS are on fire and so in demand.     He wrote and produced all the songs on this album. He moved to LA at 17 and has to work his way up, hitting the low point of having to sell all his instruments and being at the risk of having his phone bill cut off. He has worked so hard for this album and every track is a SMEEZE (a hit).    \\"Grenade\\" - he pours his HEART, SOUL and KIDNEY into it.   \\"Runaway Baby\\" - fun track I have on repeat.  \\"Talking to the Moon\\" - you've felt like this too  \\"The lazy song\\" - Jason Mraz like genius.     His voice has been perfected and come clear crisp and smooth. Youtube his live videos for the SAME voice. No auto-tune or anything.    I got dissuaded by the cocaine charge as well, but as I read more into it, I found that he did it ONE night after a show in Las Vegas, and it was the first time he'd done drugs (hence why he got caught like 10 mins after -_- ) He called the mistake \\"foolish\\" and got off with a warning from the LAPD cause it was his first offence.     BUY his album.   I used to illegally download. But this man actually deserves a PURCHASEEE.  So good.  And he's influenced by Doowop music.     Brunooo Mars all the way man!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time. While the Colin Firth version is beautiful and very true to the book, Matthew Macfadyen is MY Mr. Darcey! Colin Firth NEVER smiles or shows any emotion throughout the film. His character is cold, even when he's trying to woe Elizabeth. He doesn't even smile when she admits her love!!!  Macfadyen's Darcy shows vulnerability and almost desperation as his love for her grows. Also, the Firth version isn't visually as stimulating. There are scenes that are simply breathtaking with the MacFadyen version -- the sun rising when the admit their love for one another could give anyone goosebumps!    My suggestion: Read the book and then you will love this beauty of this movie and its passion.

B00275EGWY|3.0|The greatest war film ever made? In my humble opinion -  absolutely not! An excellent first time effort from Bigelow  but this film will not stand next to superior war films that  stand as classics ('Das Boot,' 'All Quiet on the Western Front,'  for example).  Isn't it always the red wire? Or is it the green?

0385341008|3.0|I &lt;3 texting, but mourn letter-writing as an art that was lost long before I knew how to write. The letters in this narrative reveal the strong relationships and humor that are forged through war and its aftermath ~ as well as the role literature and other art can play in keeping people human even in the most inhumane times.<br /><br />The narrative follows Juliet, a 30-something female writer who is looking for a new (and hopefully more literarily significant) project after living in London during World War II and writing a light-hearted column about life on the homefront for a national newspaper. The columns have just been gathered and published as a book, so Juliet embarks on a book tour, throws a teapot in the general direction of a rude reporter and abandons her first book idea.<br /><br />But the seed for a more fruitful project is planted when she receives a letter from a man who somehow acquired a book she used to own. He lives on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel between the U.K. and France. The island was occupied during the war and apparently, no bookstores survived.<br /><br />Few pigs and trees survived, too, which is how the book's namesake society formed. A group of islanders managed to hide a pig from their German occupiers and had a good pig roast. Walking home past curfew, one of the islanders attracted German soldiers through drunken singing, so another, craftier woman told the authorities they had just finished a book club meeting and invited them to come to future meetings. Of course, no such club existed, so the next day, they went about creating one.<br /><br />The book reveals its wartime story as its characters are struggling to gain their footing in a post-World War II world. Engaging, but slow and predictable in a few areas.
B0038NN3B4|3.0|\\"Significantly decreasing carb consumption causes your body to burn its built up reserves of its preferred fuel, fat, for energy, a perfectly natural process.\\"<br /><br />Since I wanted to try losing weight using the Atkins bars and shakes I decided to visit the Atkins website to find out more. I found that there is basically no information about how to incorporate the bars and shakes into a diet beyond using them as \\"snacks.\\" So since I couldn't find the information I needed I figured it was in this book. I was wrong! Also, reading the Atkins book on the Kindle is fast and easy but it is more difficult to cook the recipes since they are spread out on numerous pages and some of the charts are so tiny they are very difficult to read. Changing the font size does not help with some of the charts. So if you want to actually cook from this book and see the menu plans then buy the paperback version!<br /><br />A lot of the information in this book may seem like incorrect advice. If you have been taught that fats are bad for you then you will probably be shocked by the recipe for Hollandaise sauce which contains 1 ½ cups of butter. The author also recommends you eat ½ teaspoon salt a day. I also think you should use caution when making the mayonnaise recipes as they have raw eggs in them.  Many of the recipes also call for heavy cream. Let's not even get started on discussing the Hot Bacon Vinaigrette which utilizes the bacon grease instead of tossing it.<br /><br />In general this book is easy to understand but putting the advice into practice may be more difficult. Instead of having one plan that guarantees weight loss, there are several stages you must go through to complete this diet. At some points during the diet you are actually testing out what works for your particular body and you could gain or lose weight just as easily. What this book aims to do is to teach you your own carbohydrate tolerance. In general the author suggests that you should cut back on all sugars and refined carbohydrates. He basically says: \\"You know what to do. So just do it. Let go of the carbs.\\" This book seeks to provide a permanent solution not just another diet. The aim is to turn your body into a fat-burning machine.<br /><br />Overall, there is a lot of interesting information in this book including information on why you will want to avoid fructose because it causes you to gain belly fat. After reading this book you may also want to find something called \\"Thicken Thin\\" to use instead of flour for thickening gravies, etc.<br /><br />So I guess after reading this book I'm not completely convinced that adding more fats into my diet is a good thing. Eating too much protein also seems like a bad idea. I think in all things you have to practice moderation. At least that is how I've been losing weight. I'm using the bars and shakes and eating lean meat with lots of low-carb veggies. I'm just not making all the fatty sauces or dressings this book suggests. If anyone reading this knows where to find more information about the bars and shakes please leave me a comment. I'd appreciate it.<br /><br />~ The Rebecca Reviewhydrates. He basically says: \\"You know what to do. So just do it. Let go of the carbs.\\" This book seeks to provide a permanent solution not just another diet. The aim is to turn your body into a fat-burning machine.     Overall, there is a lot of interesting information in this book including information on why you will want to avoid fructose because it causes you to gain belly fat. After reading this book you may also want to find something called \\"Thicken Thin\\" to use instead of flour for thickening gravies, etc.     So I guess after reading this book I'm not completely convinced that adding more fats into my diet is a good thing. Eating too much protein also seems like a bad idea. I think in all things you have to practice moderation. At least that is how I've been losing weight. I'm using the bars and shakes and eating lean meat with lots of low-carb veggies. I'm just not making all the fatty sauces or dressings this book suggests. If anyone reading this knows where to find more information about the bars and shakes please leave me a comment. I'd appreciate it.    ~ The Rebecca Review
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I like every song involving Bruno Mars, from the collaborations to the EP, and this album is GOOD, i love the first song \\"Grenade\\", one of the best songs i have ever heard. The rest of the album is great, laid back, easy to listen music.    Highly Recomendable.    Top Songs:  Grenade  Just the way you are  The lazy song  Count on me  The Other Side
030726999X|5.0|I had mixed feelings about the first and second book in this trilogy. They were slow and laborious at times for me, and many of the characters are very thin. But I felt strangely drawn to learn about Lisbeth Salandar - she is the pull in these books, for sure. And I'm glad I stuck it out, because this third book provided the pay-off. Satisfying in every way - as a thriller, as a justice/vengeance tale, as a psychological portrait of an unconventional heroine (or anti-heroine, really!), and as commentary on the media, power, and the relationship between a government and its citizens.<br /><br />So I do recommend reading all three of these, although its not always easy.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|Received it in quick fashon, seems to be doing its job, cpu is not over heating.
030745455X|3.0|Like many middle books in a trilogy, this book lags, and overall doesn't feel like a book in and of its own right. It is expanding on plot points from the first book, and setting up plot lines for the third.<br /><br />After reading the first, I wasn't sure I was going to read this one, as I had mixed feelings about it. But I felt strangely compelled to find out more about Lisbeth Salandar, so that certainly says something. The author has created a fascinating and enigmatic character in her. And although I found this 2nd book a bit slow, and even skimmed many parts, having just finished the third book I will now say that the pay off was worth it. The third is by far the best book, so if you make it through this one, do invest the time to read the third.
0439023513|2.0|Like most of the reviewers I loved \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\".  There was violent content but I thought it was handled appropriately with the storyline, making the books suitable for older teens on through adults (I am 50+).  Both of the prior books gave the reader a heroine to root for and very likeable characters.  The plot was the most intriguing and unique to come along in years.<br /><br />But then comes \\"Mockingjay\\" and the whole tone of the story becomes extremely dark, there is MUCH more violence, and most of the characters are destroyed, either psychologically or physically, or both.  Our heroine becomes a puppet at everyone else's beck and call and most of the characters seem to have had mind transplants (figuratively), turning them into almost unrecognizable characters from the first two books.<br /><br />Because of \\"Mockingjay\\", I would not consider this trilogy to be appropriate for young teens or adolescents.  And because of the negative impact of this book, I would seriously consider who I would recommend the trilogy to.  This is such a shame because I recommended the first two books to all ages of friends, relatives, and acquaintances.  I even sent all three books to my granddaughter and really regret sending \\"Mockingjay\\" before I had read it myself.  She is 17 but has a soft heart.  This book devastated her.  This book is dark, depressing and devastating.  In other post-apocalyptic novels I have read, I have expected this or at least considered that this might be a possibility.  I did not expect it after reading the first two books, which were full of hope, and I did not expect it, especially to this degree in a book published as a YA book.<br /><br />I wish that this book had followed in the same vein as the prior two.  The trilogy would have become one of my favorite reads of all time.

B003XX2PPO|5.0|I must say that this is another excellent production from Luis Miguel.  Of the 10 songs I dislike 1.  That is a feat all in itself.  I saw many 1 star and 2 star reviews that prompted me to write this one.  Yes, it's somewhat similar to his older stuff but what do you expect its Luis Miguel.  He does three types of albums: Rancheros, Romances and Pop and he does them all in his own style.      Don't compare this to Complices, one of his best Bolero albums because its a different genre.  While some of the songs lack in the word department, LuisMi's style and voice carry the song.  Why change when you have a good thing, why change when you still sell out your concerts and make a killing on the CD's.      Luis Miguel is in a class all by himself.  To say he needs to diversify to get more fans, is wrong. I point you to Shakira who diversified herself and lost me as a fan.    Anyway, 5 stars all the way.  Think Amarte es un Placer with a little more pop.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|What do you get when you blend an excellent script, superb acting, astute directing and a razor-sharp soundtrack? \\"The Social Network\\".  This is a movie with Oscar written all over it.  I won't be surprised if it gets several Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, including Outstanding Actor (Jesse Eisenberg), Screenplay (Aaron Sorkin), Soundtrack (Trent Reznor), Best Director (David Fincher) and Best Picture.<br /><br />Eisenberg does an excellent job of portraying Mark Zuckerman, the brainchild behind the development of Facebook.  Whether at school or on-the-job, we've all known someone with Zuckerman's style: a sarcastic, nerdy, know-it-all who knows just how to get under your skin.  Eisenberg succeeded in achieving all these traits.  At times, I wanted to reach into the picture and grab him by the throat.<br /><br />The main plot theme revolves around the creation of Facebook, which had previous incarnations with the names of Facemash and THE Facebook.  Zuckerman and his friend & Harvard classmate Eduardo Sevarin are recognized as the original cofounders of Facebook, but that fact is actually brought into question by other Harvard students who come forward saying Zuckerman actually stole their idea.  So did he or didn't he?<br /><br />Justin Timberlake plays the role of Sean Parker of Napster fame.  He is able to motivate Zuckerman to move to California to set up shop.  Timberlake does a fine job of portraying a suave young businessman with used car salesman-like tactics and questionable motives.<br /><br />Trent Reznor, the frontman for Nine Inch Nails, is responsible for the exemplary soundtrack featured in the film.  The unique, well-paced music adds an air of suspense to what could otherwise be considered average scenes.  I don't usually pay a whole lot of attention to the soundtrack unless it's full of classic rock or pop songs, but Reznor's nicely crafted sounds add a unique feel to the movie.<br /><br />Bottom line: This deftly told, smartly acted story of an anti-social Harvard nerd-turned-CEO is one of the best films of the year.ned-CEO is one of the best films of the year.
0807262013|5.0|I was hesitant to pick up the series because of how it seemed aimed at children and young adults, but I regret that now. I am a huge fan of the Fantasy genre, and have read quite a bit, and I have to say I have never been so moved by any Fantasy series before. Pullman has a talent for portraying sweetness, love, and innocence...a talent you might not expect if you listen to some Christians. I cried several times during and after listening to this audiobook, and I rarely cry at movies or books. You will come to love Will and Lyra, if you hadn't already from the first two books, and your heart will break for them.    One thing I especially enjoyed was the full cast, including the author himself as Narrator. I'm used to one or two readers doing every voice, some of them with great skill, but they just can't compare to a full group of talented actors breathing life into every role. I don't think I'll ever forget Lyra's voice, and Philip Pullman's gentle description of her thoughts and feelings.    Put aside your feelings on Christianity and open your mind. This is not a scheming, malicious corruptor of youth at work here. It is an author with a gift for descriptions of joy, love, beauty, innocence, and life such as I have never seen before.
0525951652|1.0|This book is definitely not worth $20 for the Kindle Edition.  Just another publisher getting greedy.  Boycott!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Bruno Mars first caught the attention of most when he appeared on B.o.B's hit \\"Nothin' on you\\" followed by Travie McCoy's \\"Billionaire\\", not to mention he co-penned Flo-Rida's \\"Right Round\\" and co-produced K'Naan's \\"Wavin' Flag\\". Now comes his debut album and he runs through a variety of styles from Reggae (the lilting \\"Our First Time\\", \\"The Lazy Song\\", the deep dub \\"Liquor Store Blues\\" with Damian Marley), Rock (\\"Runaway Baby\\"), to Pop and Funk on everything else.<br /><br />The tender \\"Grenade\\" (with soothing harmonies) finds him declaring \\"I'd catch a grenade for you / Throw my hand on a blade for you / I'd jump in front of train for you/You know I'd do anything for you\\", all for a girl who won't do the same for him. \\"Just The Way You Are\\" is set to skittery martial beats, \\"Marry You\\" is sixties-style Pop (with rather cheesy lyrics), \\"Talking To The Moon\\" an expansive ballad on which he gets to really flex his impressive vocals (reminiscent at times of Michael Jackson), and the Folky \\"Count On Me\\" sounds very Jack Johnson.<br /><br />Last but definitely not least is the ultra catchy upbeat \\"The Other Side\\" with a nice spoken bridge featuring B.o.B and Cee-Lo adding his soulful vocals. \\"It's better if you don't understand\\" goes the refrain to an enchanting wall of harmonies. I had feared this would turn out to be one of those over-rated albums, but it is definitely a winner!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This is an awesome CD! I went to a paramore concert and it was so awesome that I just had to own this CD.  A must have!

B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie was absolutely incredible. Edgar Wright brought his A-game to this film and it definitely shows. This film is hilarious, exhilarating, mind-blowing, and the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. The cast is also phenomenal. Michael Cera does things differently in this film, and it's almost as if he becomes a parody of his usual self. He pulls off Scott Pilgrim perfectly because he practically is Scott Pilgrim. I also thought Brandon Routh was downright fantastic as Todd Ingram. The music in this film's also great and brings a lot of life to this already crazy film. Forget Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Scott Pilgrim is going to be Edgar Wright's \\"Pulp Fiction\\". This is going to be the movie that all of his next movies are measured up against. Even though this is an adaption, it's undoubtedly Wright's movie and it shows. It's not for everyone, but I know a lot of non-nerds who loved this film. If you like Edgar Wright's previous works, Scott Pilgrim is probably going to be something you will love. Next to The Social Network, this is the defining movie for this nerd-generation. We finally have our \\"Ferris Beuler\\".
B003EV6DBW|4.0|I am a hardcore fan of the Tenth Doctor, and I also enjoyed the Ninth Doctor era very much. I was nervous about Stephen Moffat taking the reins this year and I wasn't too sure about Matt Smith. I suppose I was predisposed to dislike series 5.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise as I grew to adore Smith's portrayal of the Eleventh Doctor. I heartily embraced the return to a more child-like wonder as displayed by this Doctor. Amy and Rory as companions were a delight. I even developed an appreciation for River Song!<br /><br />Sure, there was a clunker or two among the episodes (The Beast Below comes to mind). Others, such as Vincent and the Doctor, were emotionally moving for me...although that episode seems to be a \\"love it or hate it\\" deal. At first I was unhappy at what I perceived to be Mr. Moffat's emphasis on the story arc to the detriment of the individual episodes. But the finale proved this is no longer Rusty's Who...and those who have struggled through every unhappy ending Russell T. Davies wrote will understand what I mean.<br /><br />Long live the Moff!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|The Expendables was hands down one of the most fun and exciting theater experiences I've had since I can remember. The plethora of action stars makes it just a lot of fun. It starts out with a bang, has a little bit of a story for filler, and ends with the feeling like someone kicked you in the face with a boot. Thing is, most people don't realize this was a throwback to the 80's when films like Predator, First Blood, Die Hard, and Commando were all the rage. Those movies didn't have oscar winning stories either, but everyone loved them because they were fun. Who can forget Dutch, Dillon, Blaine, and the other team of commandos out in Central America sent to kill the Predator, only to become the prey themselves. John Rambo, the one man army who took on a small town police department. John McClane, the everyday normal guy who got caught in a bad situation and ended up saving the hostages and his marriage. John Matrix, the retired special agent out to find his kidnapped daughter, armed to the teeth with infinite explosives and combat knowledge. If you're a man and get a sense of nostalgia when you think about those films, you owe it to yourself to kick back, turn your brain off, and your testosterone into high gear with a few buddies and enjoy the ride.    Every star has their moment where they shine, but in my theater I don't think anyone got as much enjoyment and praise as Terry Crews when he went to town with the AA-12 shotgun. It was also good to see Dolph Lundgren on screen again. The cameos by Willis and Schwarzenegger just gave it an even more old school feel. I must warn you though, the truth is, you're not going to get something as deep as 'Inception' or something as timeless as 'Citizen Kane'. Film snobs are going to eat this and spit it out like there is no tomorrow, but who cares? Everyone loves a movie with a great story, one that will make you think, and one that will stick with you. This film was made for men who were sick of seeing vampire teenagers falling in love, spoof movies that were never funny in the first place, and movies that paint a picture of all men being evil creatures. I'm looking at YOU Lifetime Channel.     The long and short, your girlfriend won't like this, film snobs will tip up their noses, and those who just don't get it will scoff and point out its flaws. But for the men out there who like their action in your face and need a couple of hours to kick back and relax, this film was made..just for you. Here's a personal thank you to Stallone and the entire cast for letting me relive the action films I grew up on in a modern setting.
1594481717|4.0|In Look Both Ways, her book of essays on the intersection of life and design, Debbie Millman writes of what she calls infinity, or what we could call lasting happiness. She says,    \\"I believe some infinities are worthy challenges: the search for what is truly beautiful; laughing at the same time with someone you love; discovering a perfect piece of poetry; experiencing the deepest feelings of empathy.\\"    Millman is a well-known author, graphic designer, brand manager, and radio host. According to Daniel H. Pink in A Whole New Mind, jobs like hers are becoming increasingly important as we transition from the Information Age into what he has dubbed the \\"Conceptual Age.\\"    Pink opens the book by describing MRIs he underwent at the National Institutes of Health. He learns that the left hemisphere of the brain controls logic, sequence, and text, while the right hemisphere innovates and creates, seeing the big picture and interpreting metaphors. These right-brain-directed qualities will become more important as society places rapidly increasing value on \\"high concept\\" and \\"high touch\\" professions, Pink believes. High concept, he explains, is \\"the ability to create artistic and emotional beauty,\\" while high touch involves the ability to \\"find joy in one's self and to elicit it in others, and to stretch beyond the quotidian, in pursuit of purpose and meaning.\\"    Dan Pink cites three reasons for the forthcoming rise of the right brain: \\"Abundance, Asia, and Automation.\\" If your work can be computerized, outsourced, or cast quickly away, you should rethink your field, Pink advises. Instead, he proposes, the jobs of the future will involve more creative activities, careers that focus on innovation and the human touch. In a very methodical, left-brained way, Pink breaks down the most important right-brain functions to six \\"senses\\": design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning. He explains that developing these skills will aid in making your professional skills more unique and desirable--an important investment in this economic climate.    Pink explains, \\"Design--that is, utility enhanced by significance--has become an essential aptitude for personal fulfillment and professional success.\\" However, good design does more than just please the eye; it can also carry enormous weight on individual and international scales. I'm not just talking about Project Runway; Pink hypothesizes that if Palm Beach County in Florida had incorporated a different design for their 2000 election ballots, perhaps presidential candidate Al Gore would have won that county--and the state, and the country. In downtown Philadelphia, Pink finds the Charter High School of Architecture and Design, a public high school that focuses upon art and design while also providing students with a more traditional education. Eighty percent of these inner-city students--one-third of which could read and do math at a third-grade level upon entering the school--will go on to enroll in two- and four-year schools, including some of the most prestigious art schools in the nation. If you don't live in inner-city Philadelphia, you can still exercise your design abilities by visiting websites where you can design shoes or even a typeface based on your own handwriting. Next stop: Freelancing for the electoral board.    Storytelling is another important tool for future personal and professional success. Story is \\"context enriched by emotion,\\" and, according to Pink, \\"the ability to encapsulate, contextualize, and emotionalize has become vastly more important in the Conceptual Age.\\" He describes the attempts of doctors and medical schools to incorporate narrative in modern medicine to establish more complete doctor-patient relations, and finds that they are as a rule successful. In the same way, stories are becoming increasingly important for businesses to convey their mission and to reach out to their audience. To exercise this \\"sense,\\" all you have to do is begin telling stories. Write a short story; if you are stymied, you could use photographs or a snippet from another work as your jumping-off point. Record the stories of friends and family on tape or video. People-watch, and create stories about these strangers.    What do entrepreneurs, painters, inventors, and classical music conductors all have in common? They all exercise symphony. According to Pink, symphony \\"is the capacity to synthesize rather than to analyze; to see relationships between seemingly unrelated fields; to detect broad patterns rather than to deliver specific answers; and to invent something new by combining elements nobody else thought to pair.\\" This skill is all about enhancing relationships and seeing the big picture. To develop his sense of symphony, Pink takes a class in right-brained drawing. He explains, \\"Drawing is about seeing relationships--and then integrating these relationships into a whole.\\" Judging from the before and after shots of his self-portraits, the class was a rampant success; he progressed from drawing as he thought parts of his face should look, to simply penciling in the relationships between nose, eyes, and mouth--to great effect. Pink also encourages those who have trouble with this sense to listen to classical music, think of solutions to new problems, and simply brainstorm to see how the mind connects seemingly disparate ideas.    Do you feel the urge to yawn when someone else does? Have you ever cried over the evening news? No, you are not a sissy; you are empathetic. Empathy is \\"a means of understanding other human beings,\\" and it is an important part of exercising the right brain. Empathy transcends culture and country; Pink cites studies showing that expressions and emotions have an inherent, universal meaning, explaining that across linguistic, geographic, and physical divides, we all have the same needs and desires. That is why \\"high-touch\\" professions such as teaching, counseling, and nursing are increasingly in demand; Pink writes,\\"Nursing consistently rates as the most honest and ethical profession in the United States . . . and its pay is rising faster than nearly every other job category.\\" To increase empathy, Pink suggests, you can enroll in an acting class, volunteer, or even just study others' facial expressions in order to understand how they are feeling and why.    Play is another overlooked but important trait in right-brainers. Pink journeys to Mumbai, India, to participate in a laughter club. The idea is that every morning before work, clubs congregate to laugh for half an hour--and such clubs are gaining in international popularity. Videogames are also becoming more eminent. Immersing oneself into the world of a game, learning its rules and interacting with other characters in order to reach goals, has real-life value. In the gaming industry, Pink notes, \\"companies resist segregating the disciplines of art, programming, math, and cognitive psychology and instead look for those who can piece together patches of many disciplines and weave them together into a larger tapestry.\\" Pink lists several popular videogames to increase your playfulness. You could also try your own version of the Rainbow Test, an alternative SAT discussed in the book, by cutting the captions out of cartoons and asking your friends to fill in their own. Such simple games work wonders for improving one's humor and wit, and I for one would love to improve my friends' senses of humor.    Moreover, as our society becomes more abundant, we have the time and means to pursue deeper meaning. Introducing spirituality into the workplace has actually proven useful in terms of productivity; Pink reports that \\"companies that acknowledged spiritual values and aligned them with company goals outperformed those that did not.\\" Pink found that walking a labyrinth did more for his ADD-addled mind than yoga or meditation; however, focusing on your goals and intentions is what is important, not the means you choose of discovering them. In the search for joyfulness, Pink suggest, try displaying gratitude; you could write a letter thanking someone for something, anything, they have done to impact your life, or you could dedicate your work (silently or openly) to someone you admire. Another way to implement the search for meaning on a regular basis is to plan a certain day off, or even just a quiet moment or two, to enjoy yourself and to think about who you are, what you want to do, and the steps you can take to get there.    Perhaps the most useful parts of the book are the end-of-chapter exercises Pink suggests to implement the practices he discusses. A good rule of thumb is to do as the professionals do: study industry magazines and books; visit conferences, museums, and festivals; keep a notebook recording good (and bad) examples of creative work; collect photographs and pictures, videos, pieces of colorful or textured cloth, trinkets--anything that inspires you. Immerse yourself in a more creative world, Pink advises, and you will carve out a niche for yourself in the ever-evolving job market.    For every skill, he lists several online tests of these senses, such as empathy, humor, and spirituality and well-being--what left-brainer wouldn't jump at the chance to quantify otherwise unquantifiable results? However, for the lower-tech among us, he also recommends books on relevant topics. Though he wrote this book before the current economic crisis, Daniel Pink's advice has never been more useful. In stressing creativity and originality, Pink guides readers to become more complete, \\"whole-minded\\" individuals that succeed on both personal and professional levels.    As Bennett Peji, an environmental designer, writes in The Essential Principles of Graphic Design,    \\"Surround yourself with good people who tell good stories about other good people. . . . Purely by association, good things are bound to follow.\\"    Daniel H. Pink is author of Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us; The Adventures of Johnny Bunko: The Last Career Guide You'll Ever Need; and Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself. The former speechwriter to Vice President Al Gore, Pink resides in Washington, D.C., with his wife and their three children.
0790737345|3.0|I enjoyed the film, *but* Wings of Desire is a great, poetic masterpiece, and I couldn't help comparing the two films. City of Angels shows the touch of Hollywood, but what can you expect? ... Also, in Wenders' film, the city (Berlin) is a character unto itself. City of Angels lacks this dimension.
0553805371|5.0|Stephen and Leonard make a good argument that is backed up by strong evidence. This book has reinforced what I have already thought for a long time.
0553805371|4.0|The book is enjoyable, easy to read and probably controversial.  This is an interesting look into the mind of Mlodinow and Hawking.  I look to science to help explain what God is expecting from up (humans) and the book seems to question if the universe needed a god for it to exist    They point out in the book how scientists have thought they understood how the world works only to discover that the thought was close but not complete.  I have not had time to finish the book. These are very brilliant thinkers, and I am looking forward to how they put all this together and how others will politically use it.    I am very much amazed at what we have discovered of the universe and our ability to use this knowledge.  I keep think of a quote I heard... \\"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\\" - Albert Einstein
0894803123|5.0|This is an awesome little ice-cream book.  It has a TON of recipes, and once you make enough of them, you will realize that they are just the jumping off point for whatever your imagination can come up with.  Their bases (such as French Vanilla, Vanilla, and Chocolate) are fantastic.  Their ideas are awesome.  They include tons of ice-creams, but also ices & sorbets, brownies & blondies, an AMAZING fudge sauce (still dreaming about it) and other yummy sauces, and a surprisingly good collection of sundae ideas that have all been great.  And this book as a \\"sense of humor\\"; you can just sit down and read it for about 30 minutes, learning about the story of Ben & Jerry, ice-cream making basics, and their take on each of the different flavors.  It's a funny and yummy book!    A few thoughts after making TONS of homemade ice-cream:    1)  You can't compare to home-made ice-cream in flavor.  The only ice-cream better than homemade is found in one of those specialty shops where they make home-made ice-cream fresh daily in their store, and have come up with fabulous flavors.  Coldstone is also made fresh daily so they have that creamy soft flavor.  But its really expensive compared to store-bought or home-made, per ounce.  Otherwise, home made is always better.  That's because ice-cream is best within the first few days or weeks when it is most soft and creamy, and that's impossible for big companies to deliver.  It's not their fault, but your ice-cream will taste better than anything you can buy in the store.  Which is amazing because it is easy to make.  So this is one of those products that really makes a HUGE difference making it at home in terms of quality.    2)  Ben and Jerry's cookbook was written before the salmonella concerns/awareness that we have now, so their recipes call for raw eggs.  You can use raw eggs if 1) you've done your salmonella research and are comfortable with the risks 2) aren't elderly 3) aren't giving the ice-cream to children and 4) aren't planning on sharing the ice-cream with anyone else.  I usually just substitute egg-beaters or any similar product because it's easy and I like to share my ice-cream with friends/family.  But it does make the ice-cream slightly more expensive to make, and sometimes I end up making multiple batches so the egg-beaters aren't wasted.  Modern recipes (as well as B&J's chocolate ones) call for making a custard first, which heats up the eggs and makes them safe to eat.  Unfortunately, the custard has to be chilled for 4 hours (some say overnight) and this can add up to a whole day more to the ice-cream making process!  So if you're frugal, you might prefer making the custard (and using another book would therefore be necessary) so that you don't have to buy eggbeaters.  But that will take more time.    3)  I'm not a huge fan of fruit ice-creams.  From multiple ice-cream cookbooks.  Just saying' :)    4)  Ice-cream is fun to make.  Here's a basic recipe:  Make vanilla or chocolate.  Two minutes before it's done, add whatever candy or cookies or nuts you want.  Mmmmm.
193413712X|5.0|The most overlooked aspect of this book is Howard's battle with Epilepsy.  Having suffered from Epilepsy for five years, the descriptions of Howard's seizures and the aura he feels is dead on accurate.  I recommended this to all of my friends and told them if they wanted to know what it was like to be me while I had a seizure, I told them to read \\"Tinkers\\".    Epilepsy is hardly romantic, and Paul Harding did a great job in translating it from an internal force to words on pages.  The level of description in this story is incredible.  Go check it out!
B000HL09MG|5.0|Anyone who labels this movie as bad or garbage has no idea what Kubrick is all about. To understand Kubrick you have to understand his style of movie making. By no means is he the \\"straightforward\\" type. He leaves alot to the imagination. There is no inbetween with Kubrick. Either you love him or you hate him. The thing I dont understand is how can ANYONE deny masterpieces like 2001, Clockwork Orange, or the Shining? Especially the Shining. Kubrick singlehandly made a movie BETTER than the book. Thats a feat that rarly happens.<br />As far as I'm concerned Eyes Wide Shut ranks up with these other movies. There is something about a Kubrick movie that keeps your eyes glued to the TV. This is no exception. Even though this movie didnt get \\"critical\\" acclaim it is one of his best. Blending sex, a secret society, and one of the hottest couples of their time makes for a instant classic. I was hooked from the get go. If your a Kubrick fan and you dont have this movie you need to buy it, it will not dissapoint.
0525951652|2.0|Ken Follett has been my favorite author for decades.  I've read all 20 of his books, including the most recent, *Fall of Giants*, the first of a trilogy that will span the major events of the 20th century.  *Fall of Giants* has a cast the size of a Cecil B. DeMille epic--British coal miners, Russian peasants, English, Russian and German nobility--and Follett does a masterful job of managing their individual stories.  What makes the book a disappointment is his rather unsuccessful effort to marry those stories to the historical events he seeks to highlight.  In short, the intersections of the plot line come off as contrived.  Also disappointing is Follett's uncharacteristic tendency to insert gratuitous sex at points in the narrative where neither the individual stories nor the historical events offer much drama or interest.  The Giants of the day who are destined to Fall--Tsar Nicholas, Kaiser Wilhelm, King George V--make only cameo appearances and never come to life.  Nor do those who are the agents of their downfall--Lloyd George, Woodrow Wilson, Lenin, Trotsky.    I'll no doubt buy the next book in the trilogy--loyalty to my favorite author won't be shattered by one clinker, even if it is 985 pages long.  But it is my fervent hope that he finds the same deft touch used for two equally lengthy tomes--*Pillars of the Earth* and *World without End*--before it's too late.
B003Y3BMFW|3.0|Like most people have already said, A sides is the superior greatest hits Soundgarden album which can be found for pennies on the dollar. Still, I got this because I wanted the videos. I also don't mind having live versions of songs. While the live versions typically aren't better than the studio recording, I already have the studio recording so why not enjoy a live version of it.    My greatest wish obviously is for them to create new material. Hopefully this sells well enough to encourage them and they aren't just trying to make a quick buck.     I do find it strange, it's been nine months since Chris informed us of the reunion and there hasn't been any word of new material and only a few live shows? I really hope they come out with something new.
B0011Z5CV0|4.0|My daughter had zero interest in Eddie. For her his songs were too short and his buttons were much to hard to press (and still are at 2 years old).    My son (5 months) is really interested in him. He loves to chew on his ears and play with the crinkle feet. He's always surprised when I push the music button.    As a parent I have mixed feelings about Eddie.  Negatives:  - buttons are much too hard for little ones to push  - songs are really short  - record function is too short  - battery box sticks out a little creating a hard surface on the back  Positives:  - bright and colorful, catches babies eye  - crinkle feet (always fun)  - fun music
0525951652|4.0|I was very surprised at the low rating for this book until I noticed why. This book was wonderful, sure it was very obvious how it was going to end. Know that three books were going to be in the series I knew that none of the major characters were going to die, which is strange considering that this is a war novel. That was the only reason why I didn't give this book a five star rating was because of the predictability. I will take my hat off to the author for entertaining and educating me, I will be the first to admit that I really didn't know much about WWI, and now I feel as though I actually know something about it.<br /><br />So if you can afford it, and don't mind carrying around a brick of a book I say grab a copy and enjoy it! I just wish i didn't have to wait until 2012 to wait for the sequel!

1442337966|3.0|Rhonda seems to have wanted to fill pages or CD space with repetitions. The message is wonderful and a good follow-up to The Secret. However - she should have hired a professional audiobook narrator rather than do it herself.  She is no narrator or professional voice actor. Her Aussie accent isn't charming, it's annoying. Every time she dramatizes \\"The Lore of Attraction\\" I'm yelling \\"It's law, not lore\\". This is the reason we don't hear a lot of people with thick Bronx accents narrating audiobooks. It's distracting and annoying enough that it takes away from the message and I finally gave up on disc 2.

B003TML0VO|4.0|Just bought this CD last night and have listened to it a couple of times.  Really like it a lot.  I have been reading the other reviews and tend to disagree with the others who have given it a bad rating.  If I had wanted the songs to sound exactly like the originals, then I would just pull out my old CD's by the original artists and listen to them.  The new remake gives it a more newer sound with a trademark Santana.  I def. would recommend this CD to anyone who has an open mind.
B003ZZAXFO|5.0|In May of 1980, former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel released his third self titled solo album which is now known as Melt (thanks to the classic Hipgnosis cover of a distorted picture of Gabriel on the front cover).<br />In early 1980, Peter was dropped by Atlantic Records in the US and Canada over this album which was an about face to his 1977 Bob Ezrin produced self-titled debut also known Car and its 1978 self-titled follow-up Robert Fripp produced album now nicknamed Scratch. This time, Peter wanted to try an album with a huge drum sound (produced well by Steve Lillywhite and engineered by Hugh Padgham) with NO CYMBALS used and it upset Jerry Greenberg at Atlantic so Peter went to Mercury Records in the US and Canada to release the album (would be re-released by Geffen in 1983 after the success of 1982's Security). Three of the tracks on Melt were previewed on Peter's UK Festivals tour in 1979 which saw Peter reunite with his former Genesis bandmate Phil Collins on drums (who appears on half of the album here on drums and percussion) and British musicians (Joe Partridge on guitar, John Giblin on bass guitar) as his usual American band were stuck in the US due to working permits. The Melt album was produced by Steve Lillywhite and engineered by Hugh Padgham (who would go to work with Phil Collins, Genesis and The Police in the 1980s). When Melt came out in 1980, fans were in for a treat (as I found out when I first played the album on a whim a few years back).<br />We open with the haunting \\"Intruder\\" which is a great number with Phil Collins' steady drum beat and Peter's haunting electric piano driving much of the song. Next is \\"No Self-Control\\" (originally titled \\"Don't Know How to Stop\\") which describes life's fast speed and features excellent vibes and with Phil Collins once again on drums (his playing here was incredible and shows the anger he was still dealing with as his first marriage collapsed) and Kate Bush singing backup and great music. \\"Start\\" is a short but sweet instrumental with just synthesizers and saxophone by Dick Morrissey. Next is \\"I Don't Remember\\" which is another classic Gabriel track about the pitfalls of having no memory (this was previewed on the 1979 UK Festivals tour). The first side closes with \\"Family Snapshot\\" which is another great track with sax work from Dick Morrissey and drums from Jerry Marotta and Phil Collins on snare drum.<br />Side two starts with the excellent \\"And Through the Wire\\", although it is up tempo, and gives me an impression of someone apparently looking through a wire fence of a self made prison. Next is the album's biggest hit \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" with Kate Bush singing the famed French refrain and has a great guitar riff from Robert Fripp and one of Peter's best vocal performances. \\"Not One of Us\\" follows and is a great piece about one either conforming or not conforming. \\"Lead a Normal Life\\" is a soft person about a person with mental issues. The last track is the phenomenal epic \\"Biko\\" which was a tribute to Steven Biko, a noted black South African anti-apartheid activist who passed away in 1977 after being 'interrogated'. It's a powerful song, with a steady beat kept by Phil Collins on surdo (an African drum) and Jerry Marotta, and Gabriel's emotional voice with keyboards and guitar. What a phenomenal track.<br />Peter Gabriel's third album (Melt) would become his highest charting album up to 1980 hitting #22 and would pave the way for more success in the 1980s and proved he finally escaped the shadow of being a member of Genesis. In 2002, Geffen Records re-released the CD in a remastered version. Then in 2010, Peter re-released the same remaster on his own Real World Records in digi-pak packaging.<br />Highly recommended!t sweet instrumental with just synthesizers and saxophone by Dick Morrissey.

B003EYVXUK|5.0|Wow....this film had a whole new take on the vampire premise. The cinematography was so well executed throughout, you were dying to see what the characters saw, what a mysterious beginning they choose to start with, so much tension builds up during the obvious bloody violence in the camera's peripheral vision with each vicious death enacted by 'Abby'. Which brings me to mention that LET ME IN is truly a career highlight for the young but so talented Chloë Grace Moretz. She plays her role with such aberrance & grimness. Despite being a remake, this flick has enough blood on it's teeth to stand alone, definitely have to buy this when it's released to dvd. Bravo Chloë !! & (director) Matt Reeves...
B002VUFKG6|2.0|When I first read Eat Pray Love, I was awe inspired. But I was also kind of young and hadn't done any traveling or \\"soul searching\\" on my own so I thought it was amazing and inspiring. However, even though I am still young, I have a little more \\"life experience\\" under my belt and I now view that book with a tainted eye...Elizabeth Gilbert is pretty whiny!  Is her life really *that* bad?    I know this review is for Committed, and not EPL, but had to say that to explain my opinion on Committed. My sister bought me this for my birthday, remembering I had enjoyed EPL, but it sat on my bookshelf for a long time. I just didn't have a huge desire to reacquaint myself with the author and had a feeling it would be whiny again. However, I recently got a Kindle and as this was the last unread physical book on my shelf, I decided to \\"ceremoniously\\" read it as kind of a \\"farewell\\" to physical books.     At first I kind of liked it and found myself intrigued--I had the impression she would talk more about Eastern marriages. However, like a lot of reviewers have already said--boy does she whine!!! The situation she and her now husband found themselves in was most likely pretty annoying but I found the method she went about handling the entire problem silly. And I say problem because she made it out to be a huge, painful one.    1. If you are THAT against remarrying--why are you INSISTING on living in the US? Why not resettle in Australia? It isn't like their only options were to live in the US OR live in the middle of the jungle in Laos...there are plenty of options available to a self employed writer and a self employed jeweler?    2. Even in EPL I still do not understand what was so horrible about her first marriage to make her crumble on the ground in pain all the time, or to make her this \\"shattered, shaking, fragile\\" thing that could in no way find happiness in a different marriage with a different man. It appears she was never abused. It may be because I am young (mid twenties) and haven't been married yet, but I just find myself rolling my eyes when she goes on and on about her awful and painful marriage and how she collapsed on the bathroom floor and.... it just seemed over the top dramatic.    Anyway enough of my rant. I am one of those people who feels obligated to finish a book once she starts it, so I dutifully read it, and am now a little relieved it is over.    I did find some points she said about marriage interesting, and the teeny bit of insight about others and some of the SE Asian cultures rather than herself was interesting as well. That's about it.

B003EYVXUK|5.0|The Review:<br /><br />Spoiler Alert- I've intentionally been vague in my description of events in the film and have endeavored not to discuss anything you couldn't glean from the theatrical preview.  But nonetheless there's bound to be a spoiler or two in the following review.<br /><br />Let Me In is the American remake of the Swedish Film, Let The Right One In, based on the bestselling novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  With incredibly strong performances by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Cloë Moretz, who played Hitgirl in the excellent Kick Ass, Let Me In earns a special place in the increasingly crowded vampire urban fantasy subgenre.  I've rarely seen such young actors carry a film on their shoulders the way these two have.<br /><br />Set in New Mexico in the winter of 1983, Let Me In tells the story of Owen, a lonely 12 year old, bullied mercilessly at school.  His parents are in the midst of an acrimonious divorce and he spends his nights by himself in the courtyard of his apartment building playing and devouring candy.  There aren't any other kids in his apartment building until one night when Abby and her dad move into the apartment next door.  Owen quickly realizes that Abby isn't like other girls.  She walks barefoot in the snow, smells a little funny and seems way out of touch.  Owen also hears strange noises coming through his bedroom wall from Abby's apartment.  The audience learns in short order that Abby is in fact no ordinary little girl and that the relationship between her and her father is unnatural to say the least.<br /><br />Let Me In is quite a subversive bit of storytelling.  It turns many clich&eacute;s on their heads.  The kids in the film are not innocent little angels.  Owen, who is constantly preyed upon by bullies, steals from his mother's purse, acts out violent power fantasies, and shows a few of the warning signs of becoming a future serial murderer.  Abby, while she has the face of an angel, is anything but.  By the time you reach the film's end and reflect on her relationships with her father and Owen, you may be surprised to find that she is actually quite a manipulative and a hugely destructive force.  Her guile is never overt, and remarkably I found myself feeling a lot of sympathy for her despite her showing herself to be capable of some truly brutal behavior.<br /><br />Let Me In also succeeds in its use of subtlety.  The most effective scenes in the film, including its climax are more effective for what isn't shown.  Appearances are deceiving, and the film challenges the audience to fill in some of the blanks and ponder why Abby and her father are the way they are and what the future holds for Abby and Owen.  It's dark and disturbing.  Although its leads aren't old enough to drive, Let Me In is very much a film for adults.  While it has some intense gore and violence, it's not gratuitous.  It's a smart film that blurs the line between good and evil and it's ending should leave you feeling very conflicted about who the good guys and bad guys are, or whether the distinction has any meaning in the context of the film.  If you want to experience a unique, tightly written, character driven vampire film, then do yourself a favor, and go see Let Me In.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.with her father and Owen, you may be surprised to find that she is actually quite a manipulative and a hugely destructive force.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|I am not one of those movie fans who is against remakes. I judge them on an individual basis. However the Clash of the Titans remake is awful. The story departs majorly from the myth of Perseus. However not in an entertaining way as the original does. The character of IO is ridiculous. The idea of Perseus hating the Gods falls flat. The riding of the giant scorpions like horses, the use of Hades as the villian - I could go on. The plot is drivel and the acting uninspired. The original was much more epic and mysterious. I have loved Greek Mythology since the fourth grade.  I also have a literature degree with an emphasis in Greek Mythology, so I really pay attention to the quality of \\"Sword and Sandal\\" films! I wish that Hollywood would stick as closely as posssible to the actual Greek Myths. They are already fantastic!

B003EYVXUK|5.0|Like many who were fortunate enough to see the the fantastic Swedish film, 'Let the Right One In' I was a little more than annoyed at Hollywood for allowing only a scant two years to pass before attempting to remake this film. If they were going to remake this film, they should have let at little more time pass by, especially since they were going to remake a film that was considered by fans and critics to be a masterpiece, and possibly one of the greatest horror films that has ever been made. Couldn't they have waited  another 5, maybe 10 years so that the original could actually settle in and take its place in the pantheon of horror movie classics. No. Hollywood, in its incessant drive to horde as much money as possible, decided to commit sacrilege and go ahead with its' remake anyway.<br /><br />However as the premiere for the movie approached, and the glowing reviews began to stream in, I was intrigued.  Was it possible for 'Let Me In' to be in the same class as 'Let the Right One In?'  Is the child actress from 'Kick Ass' really that great, and is the kid from 'The Road' really that affecting as Owen, the boy who is brutally bullied without impunity by his three tormentors.  After seeing the film, I grudgingly have to say yes.<br /><br />'Let Me In' is just as good a movie as 'Let the Right One In'. 'Let Me In' is very faithful to the original in many ways, but the new director, Matt Reeves, does inject some of his own vision into his adaptation of the brilliant book that this movie is based on. First, the violence and emotion in 'Let Me In' is a lot more visceral and aggressive than it was in the original film. Matt Reeves films most of his movie through closeups, and when a violent act is committed or a person is suffering emotionally, the film goer is impacted more forcefully. Chloe Moretz's(Hitgirl from Kickass) character in the film embodies this films aggression. She is the vampire who charms people with her 12 year old facade, but when she is hungry for blood, she morphs into a crazed killing machine. Abby kills without reservation because it is in her nature to do so. And when she kills in this film she freaking kills.  She rips skin, she breaks bones, and emits a banshee like wail while doing the deed. There are more scenes in this film that illustrate this movie's more aggressive take on the source material than the original film, and this may offend some people. But the aggressive nature of this film appealed to a different side of my sensibility.<br /><br />The great thing about both of these movies is the focus on the relationship that develops between two very lonely people. Abby, the vampire, is a 250 year old being who is trapped inside the body of a 12 year old girl.  Owen, as I've stated above, is a 12 year boy who is mercilessly bullied at school, ignored by his mother, and is emotionally disconnected from his father. Abby and Owen suffer through an oppressive loneliness because of their respective situations.  When they find each other on a cold night in a desolate town in New Mexico, a relationship between the two principles ensues.  However, at the beginning, Abby enters into the relationship with caution, while Owen, who is so desperate for companionship, is frustrated by Abby's reluctance. Abby even warns Owen that they can't be friends at their relationship's inception. But after a while, Abby becomes intrigued by and then eventually begins to care for Owen and Owen for Abby. Abby and Owen develop an unbreakable bond, much to the dismay of Abby's \\"father\\" and they are soon bound to protect each other from harm. They provide a much needed companionship for each other, and they will protect their relationship at any cost, even if the continuation of their relationship calls for the sacrifice of the people who are in their lives. But when you're dealing with two lonely and suffering twelve year old kids, could you expect anything different?<br /><br />The acting is great from all of the principle actors. Richard Jenkins and Elias Coteas each shine in their roles as the \\"father\\" and the cop who investigate the \\"ritual\\" murders taking place in the small town.  But it is the two kids who create an indelible impact in the viewers mind. Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smith McPhee are both twelve years old, but their acting is so beyond their respective ages. Kodi Smith McPhee is amazing as Owen.  His performance invites sympathy for his plight, but he also provides us with a glimpse of his character's potential as a future sociopath when he indulges in his fantasies of killing people, and creepily spies on the neighbors in his apartment complex.  Chloe Moretz is equally effective as Abby, projecting sadness, innocence, world weariness, and craftiness through her characterization of Abby. Even the bullies who torment Owen are great, especially the leader who injects his character with a muscular brutality that his counterpart in the original film did not have. In the book, the main bully is written as someone who is quite capable of murder, and the boy who plays him in this film really gives you that impression.<br /><br />So give this movie a chance.  I promise that you won't regret it. It is so much better than the horror movies that the American public has to sit through now a days. This movie doesn't focus on devising creative ways for one person to inflict violence on another person(Saw and Hostel) as a means to create horror. \\"Let Me In\\" performs a study of horror based upon dysfunctional relationships, and the psychological damage that these relationships can inflict.  The violence that takes place in the film is a necessary counterpart to the story, and a necessity for the main character, not a means for amusement. So when Abby does kill, you're not tempted to roll your eyes and groan because of absurdity. And it is not just Abby, every character in this film does what they do out of necessity, not gratuity.<br /><br />Oh, and read the book that both films are based on.  You will be thoroughly affected by the book.  I guarantee it.Coteas each shine in their roles as the \\"father\\" and the cop who investigate the \\"ritual\\" murders taking place in the small town.

B003YBNRHU|5.0|This is the Doobie Brothers album we have been waiting to hear. The tunes are very catchy and as usual the styles are diverse from good time rock to ballads and R&B. It is not a formula album recreating the past. Only one song has the typical choppy Doobie guitar riff. The tracks are strong and you will find yourself playing it a lot.It is the right combination of Doobies Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons and producer Ted Templeman. The bonus DVD of vintage Doobie film is great fun for us who were following the Doobies 37 years ago.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|My son was diagnosed w/ AS this year so I've been learning a lot about AS & autism lately.  I first heard about Ms. Grandin when reading other books about autism but I didn't know much about her & her personal story.  I just knew she had AS & had written articles & books about it.  He's not exactly like her but there are a lot of similarities to them.    When I heard about this movie I knew I wanted to see it.  I watched it after all the kids went to bed and really, really enjoyed it.  Just as a movie, it's enjoyable to watch.  Seeing the different times of her life - as a child not responding normally, as a teenager not fitting in & knowing she's different, in college trying to get people to understand and accept her, as a working women in the cattle industry working against sexism...  There was a lot to this movie.  At different times during the film you can \\"see\\" how she thinks as lines and drawings, like a blueprint, are on the screen showing you what she sees.  That helped me to understand how my son thinks sometimes because when I ask him to explain why he's said what he's said, he tries to walk me through it by referring to something he's seen before.  Hard to explain.    Anyway, I completely recommend this movie for anyone who has a family member with autism or for anyone just wanting to understand more about it.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|...but instead he created a program that shrunk the planet. The movie was enjoyable for the artform that it is thus, the four stars but nothing exceptional or mind stimulating. The acting must be very good but since I don't know these real life characters I'm going to give room for exaggerations and hyperboles. The dialogues are really good but the legalese must be close to what it was. The irony was very well played out as well. The movie did not give me any sort of compulsion to read the book though just enjoy the ride. For what it's worth FACEBOOK is not that big of a turn or change as far as communications or technologies are being practiced.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I won't break this album down into a song by song review as it's already been done. I only just received this album today and just got through my first listen and I am once again blown away by this band. These guys just keep doing it time and time again and are truly legends in my book. There is no filler here as every song on this album is outstanding. The only problem I had was with the Satellite 15 part of The Final Frontier song, it was just a little odd sounding to me, but certainly not enough to take away a star. The highlights for me were El Dorado, Coming Home, Isle Of Avalon, and Starblind. When The Wild Wind Blows is also a beautiful song of epic proportions. The cover art and album art as a whole is perfection as usual. I highly recommend this latest release from the metal gods Iron Maiden and sincerely hope that they continue to make music in the future. Do yourself a favor and buy this wonderful album, you will not regret it.
B000002LVB|5.0|This album, and \\"The Velvet Underground\\", are the definitive albums by this band.  Add \\"VU\\" to the collection.<br /><br />Every song on this record is easily memorable.  I understand Lou Reed quit the band over the edit to \\"Sweet Jane\\", and if you buy the \\"fully loaded\\" edition of this CD you'll get Lou Reed's preferred cut.  I have to disagree with Mr. Reed, though:  the version of \\"Sweet Jane\\" on this album is the perfect balance of rock and pop.  Lou's preferred version just goes flat with the \\"extra\\" verse that he was angry had been edited out of the version on this record.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|ok i got this and i watched it all night and went in to work late the next day with no sleep. This was the most epic series i have ever seen. i could not push the stop button. a must have
B000002G7E|1.0|If you can sit through 17 1/2 minutes of \\"Sister Ray\\" \\"suckin' on that ding-dong\\" , then go right ahead.<br /><br />There are a lot better records out there even if you are into the \\"avante garde.\\"
B000LXISE6|4.0|Enjoyable music, wonderful voice.  A MUST for the diehard Groban fan, a nice addition to your music sets for those who like his music without putting him on a pedestal.
B000002G7G|5.0|I had previously given a bad review to \\"The Velve Underground and Nico\\" for bad sound and amateurish playing, and I refuse to even touch \\"White Light, White Heat\\" for the same reason.<br /><br />Back in the day, though, I had bought those albums with this one, and the difference is night and day.<br /><br />On \\"The Velvet Underground\\", the band can play; Lou Reed can sing (well, a lot better anyway), and the writing is phenomenal.<br /><br />Only one song, \\"The Murder Mystery\\", recalls earlier avante garde doodlings.  The rest of the record is top-notch pop craft with just a hint of streetwise grit.  Some of the songs are simply beautiful; all of them are uplifting.<br /><br />If you are curious about the Velvet Underground, get this one or \\"Loaded\\" first.
B003YBNREI|3.0|I first got into the Doobies in '74 and have everything they have ever put out ...including \\"Introducing The Doobie Brothers\\" (which Pickwick records put out without their permission) and all of their solo stuff. I was so stoked about this new album that I ordered the LP and the CD! I'm a hard-core Doobie fanatic ...and maybe that's why I just can't get into \\"World Gone Crazy\\", which for me, is as much  a departure from what I fell in love with about the Doobies as was \\"One Step Closer\\". When I heard the steel drums in the opening track I knew this wasn't going to be the revival album I had hoped for. I listened to it from start to finish 5 times and other than \\"Nobody\\" and \\"Law Dogs\\" it just doesn't have that Doobie Brothers sound. \\"Old Jaurez\\" sounds more like a Santana riff and the ballads are just boring with corny/silly lyrics.    The album simply has no good-old rock n' roll. There's no grit. At least Brotherhood had \\"Dangerous\\", Cycles Had \\"The Doctor\\" and Sibling Rivalry had \\"Jericho\\" and \\"45th Floor\\". There are no flashes of that on \\"World Gone Crazy\\" ...its Pop music.    I still love 'em ...saw them twice this year and will see them next year when they come around again. I'm happy that so many folks are thrilled with this album and wish I could be too.    Added 10/7/2010  OK ...I've changed my rating from one star to three stars because in the world of crap music available today, it deserves three stars. However, as a Doobie album, it will be the last one I reach for when I want to listen to Pat and Tom. Sorry folks, after four more listens I'm just not diggin' it ...I actually like it less now than on first listen.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I have to admit, I gave up on this album a bit after a couple of listens... initially.  You see, I was one of those that felt this album was lacking because there wasn't a song that grabbed me like Wake Up or Keep the Car running from earlier Arcade Fire albums.  I'm not sure why as I tend to love cohesive albums more than what I call songs based albums, which brings me to my current love of the album.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago, I happened to hear Month of May on the local NPR station, and I was loving it.  I decided, I'd give the album another listen, and I haven't stopped since.  This album is perhaps the most cohesive of all Arcade Fire albums and works well as a concept album.  While the previous Arcade Fire albums are fantastic, they tended to hold together well for my listening in smaller segments.  They weren't bad, but this album really carries the title theme through from start to finish very well.  It reminds me a bit of The Decemberists Hazards of Love album.<br /><br />I've seen criticism that this album is a bit too broad (too many tracks perhaps), but I like to think of it as part of the sprawl going with the title.  There are plenty of great tracks here that even the less interesting tracks feel like they work as transitions that are by no means bad.  This especially shows in songs like Half Light I and Sprawl I, which both serve as build ups to the two tracks I find the best on the album Half Light II and Sprawl II.<br /><br />This breadth with great tracks, transitions, etc, really make this album epic in proportions. At the same time, this is what makes the album a grower and led me to discover how great it was only after initially giving up myself.  I definitely think this is the Arcade Fire's best and definitely one of the better albums by any artist in 2010.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|White Nights is a truly great film, perhaps in these modern times a little outdated, but nonetheless a true gem!  This film is the story of a Russian defector who, by a mishap, arrives back in Russia, where he befriends an American deserter. These characters are portrayed by ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines, tap dancer, respectively.  The plot is slightly predictable but still very enjoyable. Helen Mirren has a small role as Baryshnikov's ex.   The acting is very good all around, the main surprise being Baryshnikov, who, after lacklustre acting in The Turning Point, puts in a show-stopping performance.  The soundtrack to this film is very good indeed and the Russian scenery is just sublime.  But ultimately it is the dancing that makes this a wonderful film - a feast for the eyes.  The dancing is nothing short of spectacular! The duets between the 2 dancers are amazing. However, it is the legendary Barishnikov who makes the film deserving of its cult status - his staggeringly, stunning dancing to a Russian song in the Kirov ballet theatre is breath-taking and heart-breaking, it is truly worth purchasing th film for that 1 sequence alone!!!!
B002AOWXQ8|3.0|I picked this album up on a whim at my local record store when they were playing it. The songs Jade, Home, and Desert Songs. Jade grabbed my attention, Home grabbed my wallet, and Desert Song closed the deal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it really seems that those songs are the best the album offers, which isn't necessarily bad, but it isn't great either.  I had really loved Home and was hopeful that there would be further tracks that worked in that duet / call-response type style of that song, but there isn't.  It is a 5-star track and among my favorite songs of the past couple of years.<br /><br />The album on the whole doesn't start off bad, and it seems to hold up fairly well through the first half.  They are a band that puts off a vibe remeniscent of the late 60's.  Where I think things fall apart a bit is after the three songs listed above where the overall tone starts to darken. While I have nothing against darker music this tone slows the album down and contrasts with that vibe. Listening closer, this problem really only shows up in a few tracks, but the pace slows down across that latter half that unless you listen to the songs individually, it feels a bit drawn-out and depressing.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the album, and even if you are not willing to try the album, the song Home is really worth getting as an MP3.  This is the band's first album, so I feel that if they keep together, they will probably only improve.  In the mean time, use caution if purchasing this album based on the song Home (or perhaps even any other track you may have heard)... they won't be necessarily representative of the whole album.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Love my kindle... hate this pricing. Hope this is not a trend. We should all boycott this book at this price
0525951652|1.0|I was just about to download this title to my Kindle... and you've GOT to be kidding on the price.  I'll get it from the library.  Publishers, get real.  I'm sure lots of other authors offer compelling, 'long' books, and are given hearty advances you're trying to recoup.  Let's hope the libraries buy lots of copies from you.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|One of the best cop dramas, would be on top with the wire. I was not very high of Michael Chiklis;s acting abilities, but the last minutes of shield showed some truly restrained acting - kudos.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|James Taylor and Carole King have both performed for decades.  I am blessed to have been around long enough to hear all their music while it was new.  They have not lost their magic.  This is great music that brings back a lot of great memories.  Taylor and King are wonderful together.  I would have gladly paid for the CD alone.  That it comes with a DVD is a very pleasant bonus.  Highly recommended.
0553582038|1.0|The first book was somewhat interesting, but then I believe the author got carried away with his fairly decent reviews.  Too many characters, religious twaddle, incest, fights between families/kingdoms,and a never ending plot/story.  Does not even come close to \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" as mentioned in some reviews.  Can't even get a decent resale price to get rid of these books.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|This camera case will do the job, but it won't knock your socks off. The best features are the extra padding that can help if you're clumsy and the velcro flap. It also has some nice compartments where you can store cards, batteries, etc.    After comparing it to the case that came with my Olympus, I've decided to stick with the Olympus case because the camera fits best into it. Still, if you aren't happy with your present case--or don't have one--the price is right on this one.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Great show. Want to be able to watch it again in the future, good price to collect the series...a definite recommend!
1440503257|5.0|this was purchased directly from Amazon=======everything was great----EXCEPT that the cookbook came without the dustcover,a real disappointment,because it was a birthday gift to a friend,and I   felt that dealing with AMAZON directlywould be the most secure way to go======hope my friend did not realize,--but dustcover or not, this book is  beautiful cookbook,not only for the recipes,but the sidebar information----which I enjoyed so much,a real plus.Thats why I chose it for a friend
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I do hate reviewing the price and not the book itself, but if Penguin publishing wants to take this position towards a longtime customer who is such an avid reader that he decided to get a Kindle, then they deserve to have their books disappear down the well of bad reviews. My only regret is that I was such an avid Penguin Classics fan before I got my Kindle. I gave them the money to later discriminate against me.    Several things stand out and begin to suggest a pattern of collusion and favored treatment between Penguin and Apple, the company that made the agency price-fixing model possible in the first place by pandering to the Big Six publishers with its offer to turn its back on consumers and create a high-priced ebook outlet with the iBooks Store. To the extent that publishers believed the iBooks App could lure customers away from the Kindle Store, it provided them with an alternative to play off against Amazon in order to jack prices up. Only Random House, the largest of the Big Six, took a \\"thanks but no thanks\\" stance toward the price-fixing collusion, one that may have been both principled and profitable.    Let's be clear. This is not a case of Penguin declaring war on ebooks. What Penguin has done is declared war on Kindle owners, and on Amazon.     You can get this book in Kindle format off Rapidshare for free. Up yours penguin.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|Good looking watch for the price.  White hands against black dial made it very easy to read and the canvass band was fairly comfortable although started to fray noticeably around the hole that I used mostly when attaching to my wrist.    You really have to wear it every day or purchase one of those self-winding watch \\"winders.\\"  The self-winding mechanism does not appear to opperate very smoothly so you really have to move around quite a bit to keep it wound if not wearing watch daily.    My biggest complaint was that the flimsy pins caused the watch band to slip off the watch body, causing it to land on the floor more than a few times.  What finally did the watch in was when it slipped off the band and fell on a tile floor, causing the watch to completely stop working after less than 30 days.

B003HKN51Q|5.0|elvis on tour (bluray) great quality & sound elvis in the 70's is my favorite paul
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Both discs are incredible. The original remastered \\"mixed\\" disc abounds with depth and clarity. This is a first rate remastering job.<br /><br />The \\"stripped\\" disc is minus the mixes brings John's voice front and center where we can truly admire the nuances of his voice. It made me feel like like I was there in the studio with Lennon.<br /><br />For whatever it's worth, the Yoko tracks sound good too...but hearing her voice in any form amounts to sonic torture.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Satriani finally has all the pieces needed to once again make a great instrumental rock guitar album! These songs are some of the best, most interesting & varied compositions he's written in years. I think having a strong band backing him up also helps. Mike Keneally is amazingly tasteful in what he chooses to play; anything that has his name attached to it is guaranteed to be quality! Nice bass lines by Alan Whitman too; Joe's songs always seem to groove more when he has someone other than himself on bass. Glad that Joe is back to playing Marshall amps; his tones are great & seem to 'breathe' a little more with added character. It seems his touch is more expressive & dynamic when he's playing Marshall. Every song on here is a highlight, even the bonus tracks you can find elsewhere, so I can't name a favorite, but hearing him venture into Robben Ford territory on Littleworth Lane ranks high just for the fact that it is so unlike what you typically expect from Joe. Highest recommendation & in my opinion one of the best examples of modern instrumental rock guitar playing I've heard in years. Great playing (by everyone), great tone & most of all great SONGS!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book not really knowing what to expect.  It was on my long list of books to read, and I needed something else for my morning commute, and it was less than $10 for the kindle, so why not?  I could not be more pleased with how surprised I was with how great this book is! I was hooked very quickly, found myself pulling out the kindle to read even while standing up on the train, and got through it in about 4 days, which is pretty impressive since I only have the option to read while on the train, and often don't bother pulling out the kindle.  But for this book, I did, and immediately bought the 2nd book, Catching Fire, and can't put that one down either!  Great book, great characters, read it!
1440503257|5.0|This cookbook is wonderful! It actually has really good, authentic British recipes with side notes about Harry Potter and the real British history of the food. I was really suprised at how practical it was, because I bought it initially because it's Harry Potter. But I cook a lot and I really do like this book.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  I never would've thought to combine J-Lo and Alex O'Loughlin in a rom-com, but they sooo made it work!  For the time that I've had it I've watched it as much as I possibly could.  I love this movie!!!!!!!!!
0525951652|4.0|With the release of \\"Fall of Giants\\", the first of his twentieth century trilogy, Ken Follett embarks on a thousand page epic that spans the years from 1911 to the aftermath of World War One.  Told from the viewpoint of characters in England, Germany, Russia and the United States, he weaves a complex yet easy to follow tale of the brinkmanship that led the world into a tragic conflict which seemed avoidable on so many levels. His device of examining socio-economic issues from the perspective of the ruling class and the downtrodden makes events of the past easily translatable to today's political observers. His characters are complex .... even though you find yourself rooting for his protagonists, they are not without blemishes and often fatal flaws.    You'll learn about a period of history that most of us don't understand, with this highly entertaining pageturner.     I had the pleasure of interviewing Ken Follett about this book recently for my podcast \\"Novelist Café\\".    Please visit  [..]for the full audio interview.     Here you'll find him disarmingly down to earth and quite willing to share his uncensored thoughts on a wide range of subjects.   Follett explains how he structures detailed descriptions of life a hundred years ago in a manner that makes for an entertaining read. He talks about how he eschews flowery verbosity in favor of straight ahead prose that is accessible without descending into bodice-ripping pabulum.    We also discuss Ridley Scott's blockbuster cable TV series based on Follett's earlier novel \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". He reveals plans for a sequel as well as thoughts on uber-villain Ian McShane.    I'm sure you'll find our chat with Ken as enjoyable and informative as I did.
B0035G7WP2|4.0|I liked this movie more than I thought I would. The characters are all interconnected, reminiscent of \\"Love Actually.\\" I thought this would be a romantic date movie, but it's not...it's kind of depressing in places. Still, the cast is great and the various storylines are poignant and realistic.
B003PIUC02|1.0|When one of the series stars calls herself \\"Lucy Lawless\\" you know better than to expect a worthy remake of the Kirk & Kubrick klassik. In fact it looks like a Tijuana Bible adaptation of \\"300\\". No subtle imagerie here. Bodies explode as if they were balloons filled with blood; its contents gushing out like animated Rorscharch inkblots. To savor the moment, the action freeze-frames itself so you can see the carnage in all its gory. And when things get slow, there's always some complimentary never-too-unexplicit fornisessions among the cast.<br /><br />Not that it's all sex and violence. There's love as well. In its most tender dialogues, the faithful wife kindly tells her husband \\"Go kill 'em all!\\". He dutifully complies. Aw[...]
B00127RAJY|3.0|There is basically no warm up in the beginning or stretches at the end of the video so you end up with sore muscles.  The way I solved the problem was by doing the warm up and stretches of other videos I have but it is kind of inconvenient to have to switch Dvds 3 times. I wish that had been part of Jillian's Dvd.
B001HN694K|4.0|This is the most notable and the most used line: \\"Off with his Head!\\" This is exclaimed by the Queen of Hearts once someone does something to upset her. This character along with the Mad Hatter make this movie truly hilarious and enjoyable. If you are looking for a serious film with a strong plot, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The strength of this film is in the area of its visuals, no effort is spared here, it is a lot of fun to watch. The story concept is one that has been beaten to a pulp. This is: start in the real world, go to fantasy world, end back in the real world. But, who cares, it can work here too.<br /><br />This film continues where the original book ended off. Alice is now grown up. At first she has difficulty in coming to terms with her return to Wonderland. But as time goes along she comes to terms with her destiny. There is a lot of action and quirky aspects that has become the hallmark of the director, Mr. Tim Burton.
0930289234|5.0|As advertised, it's the \\"Watchmen\\" graphic novel. I love this story and have read it several times.  If you aren't familiar with the story of these \\"heroes\\" and their all-too-human flaws, I'm not going to give you a synopsis here. That being said, I ordered this because I lent my old copy to a friend who never had a chance to return it. The shipping was prompt and I was able to track my shipment as soon as it left the warehouse. No complaints here.
0061091480|3.0|First things first: there are some very fundamental principles to learn in this book if you were not aware of them already. These include trusting in yourself and not having to rely on others, present-moment thinking, the rejection of negative emotions, separating your self image from other-oriented criticism and failure, etc. Indeed, there is a lot of good content here. Dyer can get repetitive, sometimes filling out a chapter with the same information said over and over in different ways, but I guess that's okay.<br /><br />Okay, now that that's out of the way...<br /><br />I was very confused with the numerous sexual references in the book. Sometimes it seems mildly inappropriate, and other times it just outright catches you off guard. This occurs mostly toward the beginning of the book. One incident in particular occurs in chapter 2. In regards to leaning how to love yourself, Dyer suggests standing nude in front of a mirror, exploring yourself sensually, with the aim of achieving \\"goose-bumps of shivery pleasure.\\" I haven't read other self-help books. Maybe this is a common theme? I sure didn't see it coming.<br /><br />Another complaint I had was in Dyer's perception of ideal relationships with others. He argues that holding any person above yourself is a grave mistake. No one is better than you. It's a bad idea to have idols or heroes, says Dyer. He brings forth obscurities as refusing to call your dentist \\"doctor,\\" for that gives him prestige for his title that he doesn't deserve. Really? Wow. There are numerous nit-picks like this throughout the book--strange rituals between the lines.<br /><br />Furthermore, one should never, according to Dyer, aid someone who needs you. He says it is better to refuse to help them, with the goal of teaching them to help themselves. The last time I checked, the phrase \\"need\\" means their request was not an optional favor--they are in trouble. I guess that's not how Dyer sees it.<br /><br />The overlying theme that I could not overlook is essentially this: your personal happiness and fulfillment are paramount to everything else. Never feel bad. Even at a funeral, show no negative emotion. Compassion is a waste of present moment time where you could be feeling happy. If you don't like something, don't do it. It does not matter what anyone else thinks, or who it affects for the worse.<br /><br />It's just an inflated, egotistical world view, and Dyer even acknowledges to disregard people who call you selfish for it.<br /><br />So yes.. I'm not sure how to feel about this one. There is definitely some content to make it worth the read, but at the same time the peculiarities mentioned leave you feeling uncomfortable at times and offended at others.onal happiness and fulfillment are paramount to everything else.

This book will give you hope and show you how love and the law of attraction works together to bring about true happiness and all the things you want in life.
055358894X|5.0|What a sharp, witty, sometimes sardonic, sometimes heartbreaking beginning to what I believe promises to be a true standout in the epic fantasy field - characters very well developed (or, develop*ing), interesting plot, cool city.  Great book.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I have read all reviews and oh boy, poor Yoko. The critisism this poor womman gets! First of all, thank you, Yoko, for making it possible for us TRUE Lennon fans to be able to hear something we have never heard before from Lennon for the past 30 years. As stated in one of the reviews, i too believe that you release his material for his fans...i'm very greatful for that....the thought of \\"making money\\" doesn't even cross my mind...only the excitement of a new Lennon release. For those of you that think that only the Lennon half is worth listening to, then you're all totally missing the point of this album anyway....he wouldn't have been able to title it \\"double fantasy\\" if the album didn't include Yoko....in my opinion, it's totally classic...all great songs from BOTH John & Yoko...to me, this is yoko at her best...they were both at the top of their game with this recording. Any TRUE Lennon fan is going to be thankful for this release...i mean what is not to like?...The version of \\"Woman\\" on the Stripped cd is completely awesome...infact they all are..just hearing Lennon's talent flow endlessly from start to finish...you can even hear him harmonizing some of Yoko's vocals, which of course go GREAT together. And as far as all of Yoko's songs, she's flawless throughout. A Pure classic, plus the newly remastered original version....how can you go wrong?? Everything is so much crisper and clearer. You've done it again Yoko...another GREAT release...I hope you have many plans to keep John Lennon's music alive in the future..they have all been so appreciated....and just for the record..Yoko Ono/ Season Of Glass is classic too....he was definately there helping you make that album!! The bottom line??...any true fan is going to completely love this release.
0553805371|5.0|We're learning more about how we got here. Hawking writes with humor and knowledge and most of all, he has the ability to put huge concepts into simple, easily understood English. The Grand Design is a great book and I can hardly wait for his next one.
B00004RF83|3.0|...thriller make. This is a disappointing film of a 60's era political thriller about the Joint Chief of Staff Chairman's attempt to stage a political coup after a liberal  US president has rapprochement with the soviets. The film is famously the one in which John Frankenheimer and Burt Lancaster made up with each other, and in which John Frankenheimer and Kirk Douglas fell out with each other. (Who knew that men could act like squabbling female friends?).    The problem with the film is the actionless, suspenseless script by Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame. In fact the film is episodic in its presentation, much like a 60's television show. Serling doesn't follow through on the thriller aspects of some scenes which cry out for it such as a southern senator's (Edmund O' Brien in a Laughtonesque protrayal of a bombastic, alcoholic legislator) escape from a secret military base in Texas, which is to be used by the  conspirators once the coup is accomplished. In addition to a boring, suspenseless script, the acting is not good  in some aspects. Burt Lancaster who can be wonderful at scene chewing when it is  called for (\\"The Rainmaker,\\" \\"Elmer Gantry\\") is also a scene chewer when subtlety and control are called for. Here Lancaster's performance has no nuance. His traitorous general is just a flat out, unsympathetic bad guy, even though the character has a some good points about soviet dishonesty and perfidy. Since he has a key role in the  film, this  hurts the production. Ava Gardner, who looks old and bloated here,  is miscast as the femme fatale with whom Lancaster has had an extramarital relationship. When Kirk Douglas romances her in order to get some dirt on his boss Lancaster, he looks like he is kissing his mother. Not cool.    The standout performance is by Kirk Douglas, a pentagon colonel who stumbles onto the plot and coldly executes his duty as an American to foil  it. He manages to convey the fact that, as a military man, he loathes ratting out his boss because his duty as a citizen is more important than the chain of command. Frederic March is good as the liberal president who is concerned that the US and the soviets are going to blow each other  to smithereens if the Cold War is not  deescalated. Edmund O'Brien has some nifty moments as a southern senator who can rattle off dialogue as fast as Edward G Robinson. The ending reminded me of \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" without its impact. In fact when the film ended, my husband and I just laughed at its ineffectiveness. A very disappointing film which purports to be a great one.
B003DZX44I|1.0|ok, we all know the story and its a good one, however, we are here to rate the quality of the blu ray dvd not the movie.  I had the unfortunate displeasure of watching the remastered blu ray version.  All the colors of the original movie, extended version or not, looked washed out.  Normal skin color was so exaggerated that it looked pink and horrible, there was no detail at all.  All the characters looked washed out, no definition to their faces.  It was a nightmare.  My husband did not notice at first so I waited till the end of the movie and put in the dvd version, non blu ray, that is also included in the diamond edition and then he noticed.  He said \\"Man, its like night and day, what a difference, its a much better picture on the regular dvd than blu ray\\".  I also have the 2 dvd platinum edition bought many years ago and that also looks better than the blu ray.  the only reason this getting one star in my opinion is because it DOES include a regular dvd version (by the way the dvd version also has 3 different versions of the movie on it) with all its beautiful detail art work and correct coloration.  if it did not have the dvd I would rate the blu ray as a negative 2.  don't waste your money like I did on this edition.  You would regret it.

B003UYUR10|5.0|I've not noticed if anyone is commenting on the DVD set itself, but have noticed many making comments about the movie. I saw this on opening day. I went with no expectations. I went for the \\"view\\" (*good looking people*, scenery, costuming, etc). I appreciated the details regarding costuming, set design, and music. This is a video game translation, how much plot do you expect it to have? How much plot did you expect the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" movie to have (based off a Disney ride)?<br />I especially enjoyed the action. There was lots of running, jumping, climbing...just like Parkour (a cardio exercise whereas most obstacles cause almost no problems and no hesitations, just instinct). As a side note, if you go to a movie with little or no expectations, there is also little room for disappointment.<br />Personally, I enjoyed this film for what it is. Pure fantasy.

B001SN78JO|4.0|\\"Yes Man\\" is a movie in which Jim Carrey goes back to his roots of comedy.  Although the movie never truly made me laugh out loud consistantly like \\"Ace Venture\\" or \\"Liar, Liar\\" I still found the movie to be funny.  I think it hit the spot for comedy movies and I will watch it over and over again for its entertainment value.      What I liked most of the movie is Zoe Deschanel. Yet again she made the character her own. Giving a quarkiness to her character in \\"Yes Man\\", as she usually does; which is a major part of her charm.     The supporting actors do a solid job, although none do an excellent job.  But they all add to the movie as a whole.      Storyline wise the movie was your prototypical Jim Carrey comedy movie.  So if you like Jim Carrey Humor you will most definately like this movie.      Overall, I enjoy my exprience with this movie and I recomend it to all those Jim Carrey Fans out there!

B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Listening to 'I'm Losing You' as I type and it's simply great. gritty and intimate.   Stripped Down is def. worth having, and you also get the original version if you don't like Stripped. 2 for the price of 1.    I remember when this album came out when I was in 10th grade. I bought the LP day of release and liked it --but didn't love it. Even my other friends in 10th grade knew it was, shall we say-'overcooked'. But we were exited he was back, no doubt about it.    'Just Like Starting Over', though a good radio single, sounded as over-processed as a slice of American Cheese to our ears. We were into the Clash and Adam Ant at the time, so it just didn't fit into where music was at the time. But then again, it was his Middle Aged album, and we were not his intended audience.    I also didn't much like or connect with Yoko's songs(though 'walking on this ice' from these same sessions was superb) but I got over it as the years passed. It is what it is, and much of her DF stuff is sweet in retrospect using the ears of a now middle aged person.    (Side note: I used to loudly play Yoko's 'Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummys Only Looking for a Hand in the Snow)' to torture my parents when they pissed me off. It's truly god awful, but in an oddly great way)     One thing to keep in mind about DF is that John wouldn't have gone in the studio at all if it hadn't been for Yoko. He stated plainly in interviews around the time that it was a showcase for her, so she could get some recognition for her music, which he felt she deserved (and which in all honesty is debatable).     So to all the Yoko haters giving this a low rating out of sheer spite--please grow up--and don't dis this grittier version (alongside the original version) because Yoko made you mad when you were`a child. Time to move on my friends.

B000026OW3|4.0|Rubinstein's stereo cycle of Chopin's recordings has been issued in boxed set for several times, starting with this version.  In three respects, this cannot be considered a complete issue: Rubinstein didn't record the Op. 10 & 25 Etudes, he did not record peripheral works like the First Sonata, and this set does not include early stereo versions of the Berceuse and Trois Nouvelles Etudes from the 1950s (in both cases, there are 1960s versions here).<br /><br />It's no surprise that RCA would choose Rubinstein's last cycle of these works for reissue: recorded in stereo, they are easy to market to a generation accustomed to excellent sound (indeed, some would only consider DDD recordings, leaving this out of consideration).  But Rubinstein changed over time, he matured and mellowed, and by the time these recordings were made, he was already considered the elder statesman of Chopin interpreters. In general, his later approach is better suited to larger scale works like the Sonatas, but I prefer the spontaneity of his trailblazing [[ASIN:B0032700TY 1930s versions]] of the Nocturnes, Mazurkas, and Scherzos, and the controlled fire of his [[ASIN:B000054279 1950s set of Polonaises]]. There is one mono disc in this set, from 1946, including Rubinstein's first recording of the Sonata, Op 35, and his only version of the Preludes, Op. 28 -- neither of which show the pianist at his best.<br /><br />These recordings were originally issued as complete sets by genre, and RCA mostly follows the original programming concept (with the exception that the Mazurkas and Nocturnes are published on 2 CDs instead of 3 LPs).  While this makes sense from a collector's perspective, I can't imagine wanting to to listen to all of the Nocturnes or Mazurkas in a row.  (It would be nice if Sony would issue a box of some of Rubinstein's more imaginatively programmed albums, like the French Recital, Brahms I Love, and Chopin I Love series.)  The sound here is from Rubinstein producer Max Wilcox's 1980s remastering of Rubinstein's recordings, which faithfully reproduces the pianist's distinct tone, although it has a bit less presence than BMG's 1999 remastering.of Rubinstein's recordings, which faithfully reproduces the pianist's distinct tone, although it has a bit less presence than BMG's 1999 remastering.
B00433C73S|4.0|I have had this album for some 30 years though it is not my favorite Renaissance album.  That one would be the Prologue/Ashes are burning double album.  With 'just' 4 songs it might be hit of miss for some.  On the positive side, I think the Ocean Gypsy song is my favorite Renaissance track of all, a sad and mournful kind of ballad in the way only Annie Haslam can render.  The 24 minute Sheherazade track is ambitious and entertaining.  The first two tracks are typical Renaissance, the dreamlike \\"Trip to the Fair\\" and the faster paced and shorter \\"Vultures Fly High\\".  I always joke with my friends that Renaissance Albums always seem to touch on such light topics as Death! So this 2nd track is almost required.     All in all, I'd buy this album again, gladly.  But if you have never heard this group before, consider also the previously mentioned Prologue/Ashes are Burning, Novella, A Turn of the Cards, or Azur D'or.  For a live album, their King Biscuit Live one is hard to beat.  If you find you love those, you will love this one.

B003HLM2QO|5.0|Scream is easily Ozzy's best CD since \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\". Sure, every album since \\"No Rest\\" has had some killer tracks, but, as a whole they were just too over produced, over thought and over long. As a fan from the beginning, I can honestly say that Ozzy spoiled me with his first 5 solo albums. Each one of them kicked ass, as Ozzy does so well, but they also all had a very unique character about them. Die hard fans know what I'm talking about. Each of those 5 albums had distinct personalities. But, starting with the very good \\"No More Tears,\\" Ozzy started getting too bombastic, giving us songs that were basically indistinguishable from one another. Not all, of course, but far too many.  Thank goodness, The Prince of Darkness is in full form for \\"Scream.\\" Ozzy and his new band have released another killer CD that has the power AND personality of his glory days. Every song is great, just the right length and placed perfectly throughout the album. In other words, it fits in very well with his first 5 releases. I won't review every song, other than saying they all floored me,  but I MUST state that the title track is truly a standout. It's a monster !!!  I have listened to this CD 4 times in its entirety, and it only gets better with each listen. I highly recommend this CD to all longtime fans, as well as to any newcomers who are ready to be rocked, and find out why Ozzy is such a legend.

B00138J4MI|2.0|After reading the reviews I can tell I'm in the minority when I say Binaural's one great track is Sleight of Hand.  It's the only reason to own a copy.  The rest of the album I processed long ago and hasn't stuck a bit for constantly coming up short.  Sleight of Hand is a bruised and haunted masterpiece.    As far as the debate over which album is the last one worth picking up, for me it's Binaural and Sleight of Hand is the reason. Pearl Jam are way too spotty in quality to revisit continually.  I mean a guy only has so much cash to burn.    My feeling is that Sleight of Hand is sooo much better than anything else on this album or any of the 3 or 4 preceeding albums that it doesn't click with the usual fan.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|I have every Roots album. This one has a different feel, just like every one of their albums. It is a good buy. The lyrics are tight (at least Blu and Black Thought). There is one song, where I thought the guest lyrics were very weak. It sounded like they were giving this one guy a shot on the mic because they owed him from a long time ago or something.    But after the 3rd time listening to it straight through, I felt it. The first time, I was like... I don't know if I like it. But I listened... I felt it.. and I said wow, I like it. It is definitely not Game Theory, but it is lighter in tone and worthy of purchase.    My gripes are:  1. It is way way too short - 43:00 min. Cmon?  2. Not enough crossover songs with alternative sounds. That is what makes Roots unique. They are able to do a grunge dark hip hop sound.  3. Too many guest artists. I don't like that. Black Thought keep rhyming on your own tracks. I pay to hear you, not these other guys.    Overall, it is a good buy. Lyrics and beats are good. Not the best of the best in comparison to Game Theory. But it is The Roots, so you know that Black Thought will have lyrics and the live band will have a funky beat.    I don't feel in this album the love for Hip Hop how they used to have. It is good, but not 5 stars.

B000FC1MCS|4.0|I won't go go over the story again, it's been more than covered. All in all I found this an enjoyable read, but bitter sweet as I have  a son with Aspergers.    There have been several reviewers who say that Christopher is nothing like the Aspies they know (or even themselves), and this is very true, due to being at the high functioning end of the autism spectrum, there is a lot of variety between Aspies as there is between all people. So Christopher is not a template of all Aspies, just one fictional snapshot of what one might be like.     I know two Aspies very well, one is my husband and the other is our teenage son. When our son got the diagnosis I read a number of books about the Aspergers ( [[ASIN:0307739589 Thinking in Pictures (Expanded, Tie-in Edition): My Life with Autism (Vintage)]] ; [[ASIN:1416549013 Born On A Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant]] ; [[ASIN:0307396185 Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's]] ; [[ASIN:184310184X How to Live With Autism and Asperger Syndrome: Practical Strategies for Parents and Professionals]] and this one). While this one is a work of fiction, it was also valuable to me because it was a darkly humourous look at Aspergers. I saw a lot of both my Aspies in Christopher, some traits were like one, some the other and some like both of them. I found myself laughing tearfully at some of the descriptions.    *note* I hope my use of the term Aspie doesn't offend anyone, it's what my son calls himself when he is talking about his Aspergers and is meant to be a term of endearment rather than a derogatory one.

B003TVMIDO|5.0|This gets five stars because the package is gorgeous and the remastering is excellent. The problem here is when you compare the remastering to the older remixed versions they pale in comparision. However, that is because the older re-issues are remixed and not just remastered. Now, compare Double Fantasy and Milk and Honey which were only remastered a few years ago to this new box and the sound is much better. Trust me, I'm right. My only gripe is that some of the bonus tracks from a few years ago are not available.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|First of all, some people don't like remasters/re-releases since they see it as just for money. You don't have to buy it though. However, one point for them besides improved sound that the big fans do want, is a way to introduce it to younger or newer fans. And it's also a good way to mark a certain occasion, like what would be his 70th Birthday week.    As for the album, I went and got it today, and the original version sounds good and crisp. John's songs are all perfect, he was at the top of his game. As for Yoko's, it's not that bad. Her music is not very mainstream, but there are some songs that are worth listening to: \\"Kiss Kiss Kiss\\", \\"I'm Moving On\\"(Does go great with John's \\"I'm losing you\\"), \\"Give me something\\" and \\"Hard times are over.\\"    As for the stripped down version, you can definitely hear the vocals more. The differences aren't intense, but you can tell. To me, \\"Woman\\" is the biggest difference from the original, the acoustic guitar really stands out. The stripped version is like an added bonus, and was a good idea to make the music fresh and make the vocals stand out some more, without changing it too much. I think it's worth a buy, $12.99(price as of this writing) is a great deal for the two albums.

0451228375|5.0|A friend gave me this book awhile back and I was hesitant to read it because of the length. I read a few reviews and everyone said it was too long and uninteresting. I finally picked the book up last week and I couldn't put it down until I finished it today. The book is very long, but I didn't find the plot lagging at all. Even though it was a very long story the pace was steady and I never became bored with it.  A lot of reviews implicate that the author must be against the Christian Religion, I didn't feel that way. There were a lot of heartless selfish people in the book, and he spent a lot of time on how awful they were, but there were also good people too and in the end the good prevailed. I don't he is the first author, or the first historian, to touch on how some people of God became too into their own self interest during those times.     Anyway, I loved the book and I recommend it!
B002T9H2L0|3.0|One of the most surprising movies I've seen lately is Inglourious Basterds (2009), written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Having seen the trailers a gazillion times last year when it was heavily advertised on TV, I was not at all wanting to see this film. It looked very campy and cheesy. And it is to some degree...but not as much I thought. I just finally saw Tarantino's widely acclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction (1994) a few years ago, and I didn't find it to live up to all the hype that I've heard about it. I think part of the problem is that I watched Pulp Fiction about a dozen years after it came out. And because it was very influential on movie making, I saw pieces of it reflected in other movies that I've seen. So seeing the original inspiration doesn't seem so inspirational and cutting edge after you've seen it in other movies over and over. Some movies are just very much of their time. And I think Pulp Fiction is one of those movies...and I missed out on its time. Having watched some older movies from the 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. in Cinema History class, I didn't really appreciate them either. They just didn't feel as complete as modern movies. But then we are all a product of our time, aren't we?!<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds is gorgeously filmed. This is the kind of movie you show to someone to showcase what's possible with film. And when I say film, I mean real 35mm celluloid film stock. Not digital video. I do think digital video will look just like film someday...but that day is still a ways off. There's a subtlety and range of light expression on film that still isn't fully realized on digital cameras like the Red camera. Beyond the incredible cinematography, Tarantino has crafted an incredible showcase of acting talent. The performances, while sometimes over the top a bit, are a testament to Tarantino's directing skill. He's able to get such finely nuanced acting out of his cast. The movie starts pretty slow and drawn out, and it wasn't until about halfway through that I even knew I liked the film. And then all during the second half I was appreciating the first half. The writing is very engaging and well executed by the cast. All in all, this a film that any movie lover should watch.

B001UV4XUG|5.0|FILM RATING: 5 stars<br /><br />REVISITED REVIEW (March 13, 2012):<br /><br />I don't think I'll ever tire of watching (500) Days of Summer (2009). It's a movie that's a part of the \\"soundtrack\\" of my life now...to use a music analogy. It takes me to a place emotionally that few films do...and it's a secret place that only a few know about (get the movie reference here?). This film just happened upon me at a time in my life when I was going through so many of the same experiences and feelings as \\"Tom\\"...falling in love with someone who isn't in love with you...re-evaluating your career and life purpose...making that same kind of idealistic speech at work...and just getting comfortable in your own skin. And of course we've all experienced some of what Tom does in high school and college when we began to date. Screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber captured something special here. And if you didn't get it...then you're just not there yet to receive it. This is a story that probably speaks to thousands if not millions of young men...and young women...and just people of any age really. That's what makes (500) Days of Summer so special. It's a modern take on a \\"true story\\" of love and heartbreak like most of us have experienced. It's about learning how to deal with both the joys and tragedies that come with love & life, and opening your heart up to it. (500) Days of Summer makes fun of love and relationships like every rom-com, throwing in great jokes, but it also takes it very seriously and shows the real dramatic and tearful side as well.<br /><br />Director Marc Webb and his team of incredibly talented fellow filmmakers crafted an awesome film. This was one of the best movies of 2009 and one of the few I saw in the theater that year...Thank God! I've also seen it on Blu-ray and in HD on HBO most recently. My previous review of this flick covered some of my initial thoughts and feelings about the film. But now, over a year later, I can see how much this film has really stuck with me both as a cinephile and a young aspiring filmmaker. I put this film in my Top 100 Movies of all time back after I initially saw it in late 2009. And it remains there to this day. Webb was able to weave together so many different disconnected ideas and bits of irony from dating that just come together so well here. Having gone to high school with Marc Webb, I had no idea that he would someday be the man behind the vision of such a truly great film. I just remember his goofy smile and laugh in Algebra class at Madison West High School. Everyone seemed to like him...and vice versa. But for his feature film debut, Marc came out of the gate with his guns-a-blazing and I can't wait to see his take on The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) next year.<br /><br />Part of what the screenwriters do so well here is flip the tables on the typical relationship, putting Summer (played perfectly by Zooey Deschanel) in more of the \\"guy role\\" and Tom (played equally perfectly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in more of the \\"chic role\\". Tom is the one who falls in love right away and Summer is the one who wants to keep things casual and not get into a relationship. It's a \\"secret\\" within the guy realm that we want what women want just as much or more than them sometimes. It's just that we make fun of each other if we admit it...so we usually don't...just like Tom's best friends. Also \\"cute\\" is how Tom's much younger little sister Rachel (played by Chloe Moretz) is much more mature and knowledgeable in the ways of love than he is. Usually its the older sibling that councils the younger one...but not here!<br /><br />Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt both capture their roles in (500) Days like I've never seen them before. Both were at the top of their acting game in this flick. They bring intelligence, wit, emotion, and fun to Tom and Summer. The casting of both of them was as PERFECT as it gets. I think probably the most unique and interesting part of (500) Days of Summer is how it jumbles the story into seemingly \\"random\\" days within the 500 days that these two characters shared together. This jumble of mini stories is edited together so well by lead Editor Alan Edward Ball that it just feels genius! By telling this story in a fresh, non-linear way, (500) Days sticks out from the packed crowd of similar rom-com flicks. I know from listening to Creative Screenwriting Magazine podcast with writer Scott Neustadter that this storytelling technique was part of the script early on. But in the hands of a lesser Editor, it might not have worked as well. The use of motion graphics that flip through the calendar days, the deep God-like voice-over narration, and the music selections, all bring the script and its real dialogue to life. Again, this was clearly an incredible aligning of many different team members on the film crew to a unique and singular vision that director Marc Webb brought to the team.<br /><br />The cinematography by Director of Photography Eric Steelberg is Fantastic! Paired with phenomenal production design by Laura Fox and Art Direction by Charles Varga, (500) Days of Summer is a visual feast. Every little detail just shines through, and when paired with the sound and music for the film, the perfect technical trifecta is hit! If you haven't yet fallen in love or had your heart broken and healed by (500) Days of Summer, then it's about time you took the chance and asked the picture out. What do you have to lose? There's a lot of fish in the sea, but this is the one for me.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW (January 16, 2010):<br /><br />One of my favorite movies from 2009 was this little indie romcom (romantic comedy).  It's not my usual kind of movie since most romcoms have little story, little character development, and little emotion.  But this movie has a heart and soul and mind that most romcoms (or chic flicks) simply don't.  It even sneaked into my Top100 movies of all time.  What's so interesting about this movie is that it's really a modern male-centric flick.  It's all about being a young guy falling in love with a free spirited girl who breaks your heart.  With the sexual revolution of the 60s up to today, the roles of men and women have swapped and many of today's men are really more of the \\"woman\\" in relationships.  They are the sweet, emotional, monogamous ones in the relationships with women who want to play the field and not be tied down.  I'm by no means saying that every guy or girl fits into this mold, but I think its more common today for my generation (Gen X) and younger  in our mixed bag culture of experimentation and growing up with strong mothers.  We're all learning how to become who we are instead of being told who we are as it used to be.  And as part of that search, what guy or girl can't relate to the experience of falling in love with someone and them not falling in love with you.  Heart break is part of maturity and coming of age these days and this movie handles it in a funny but sophisticated way that speaks to me as a guy.<br /><br />I've experienced EXACTLY what Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Tom does in this movie...both in terms of career and relationships.  And I guess that's a huge part of what connected me to the story.  But of course being an architect, it's always cool when a movie involves an \\"architect\\" as Tom aspires to be.  He starts as a naive and idealistic greeting card writer who meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and falls for her.  As a filmmaker and storyteller, what really was \\"cutting edge\\" to me about this movie was the way the story was told.  It's a jumble of various \\"days\\" or moments in the relationship of Tom and Summer, jumping around from the beginning to the end and everything in the middle.  It's a clever way of showing the ups and downs of the rollercoaster that is every relationship.  And an intriguing way to tell a movie.  Even though the story jumps around, it still builds to a crescendo like most classic three-act stories.<br /><br />It's hard to compare this movie to The Hurt Locker or Avatar, which were the front runners in the Oscar race, but in my book, this should have been a contender for Best Picture 2009.  Check it out on DVD or Bluray if you haven't seen it yet.  And be ready to laugh and cry and experience everything in between.that it's really a modern male-centric flick.

0525951652|4.0|I don't understand all the reviews complaining about the price for the ebook.  I want to read what customers thought of the book itself.  Complaining about the cost does not help readers determine if the book is good or not.
B001TKK3O8|3.0|There's nothing like a good mind game movie. And Fracture (2007), starring Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, is a classically good crime thriller. I watched it for the second time tonight after seeing it a few years ago when it came out on DVD. Next to Hannibal Lector, I think this is one of Hopkins best roles because he plays such a smart and clever character who shoots his wife and then finds away to get out of being found guilty for it. The movie is a cat-and-mouse chase between Hopkins and Gosling's lawyer who is trying to convict him.<br /><br />Director Gregory Hoblit crafted a solid movie...the best of his movies that I've seen, which include Frequency (2000) and Primal Fear (1996) as well. I think this movie has been under-appreciated. The production design and photography are excellent. And I love Hopkin's home in the movie, the architecture is definitely my taste. It's a blending of modern and asian minimalism with a love of classic crafted materials...much like the movie itself. The acting and chemistry between Hopkins and Gosling are excellent too. I really can't say much more than check this flick out.
B001IC0I7E|5.0|The books helps to have the movie make sense.  Great read, couldn't put it down.
B001TOD9VI|3.0|I watched The Wrestler (2008) starring Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, and Evan Rachel Wood recently.  Directed by Darren Aronofsky, this little indie film ended up becoming the comeback vehicle for actor Mickey Rourke.  He deservedly won a Golden Globe for his performance.  I thought the film was a great character study, specifically about a broken man who has made a lot of mistakes in his life, but who loves what he does, even though it is basically killing him and ruining him.  The movie is filled with phenomenal acting and Rourke certainly deserved his Oscar Nomination and Golden Globe win for Best Actor.  And I think Marisa Tomei earned the respect of those who doubted her for winning Best Supporting Actress in My Cousin Vinny (1992).  I must admit, as much as I love My Cousin Vinny, I too am still surprised at her Oscar win for that performance.  I still remember being completely shocked when they announced her name as the winner at that Oscar telecast.  The only other shock that surprised me more at the Oscars is when Saving Private Ryan (1998) lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare In Love (1998).  I'm still pissed off about that upset.<br /><br />Check out The Wrestler...it's definitely worth viewing.  And of course some of the cinematography is great.
1853261165|5.0|Little Women and Good Wives are two of the best classics. I loved both when I read them; it's hard not to get wrapped up in the lives of the four March sisters and their adventures with Laurie, the next-door neighbor. We follow Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy through hardships and excitements, sorrows and joys. These two books definitely keep you turning the pages! This edition is, of course, unabridged, and has a nice cover, making it a pretty addition to your bookshelf.
B001FB55LC|4.0|Brothers (2009) is one of those incredible indie films with incredible talent that was incredibly UNDER-rated when it came out in theaters. Even though it was a remake of a Danish film of the same name from 2004, it felt very fresh and American to me. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Having watched the behind-the-scenes extras on the DVD, which include scenes from the Danish film, it seems to me that this story was even better told from an American point of view. I don't want to give away the story since this is a movie all about story and characters, but basically it's about 2 brothers and their family, set against an Iraq/Afghanistan war story. Tobey Maguire's character Sam Cahill gets captured while stationed in Afghanistan and is assumed to be dead. His wife Grace, played by Natalie Portman, grieves and works to move on with her life after this news and the funeral. Sam's trouble-making brother Tommy, played with understated brilliance by Jake Gyllenhaal, becomes the replacement father and husband for Grace gradually. Of course a relationship develops between Tommy and Grace and that causes trouble when it turns out Sam is not dead and returns home from Afghanistan.<br /><br />I think what is so brilliant about this movie is the complexity of the characters, but also the simplicity of the them at the same time. The acting by the three main young actors is great and was sorely overlooked by the Oscars. The Trailer does not do the movie justice, although there are some great scenes from the movie in the trailer.  This is one of those movies, like Crazy Heart (2009), that has to be watched to be fully appreciated. This is up there with my favorite movies of 2009: Crazy Heart, (500) Days of Summer, It Might Get Loud, A Single Man, and Up In The Air.
030726999X|2.0|After reading the first two novels in the trilogy I was expecting much more from the final book. Instead I found myself getting bored with this one. There are far too many unnecessary characters and confusing subplots. There is very little suspense, and I was able to put this book down for 2 weeks while I went on vacation and not even care.  Speaking of the ending, when you finally get there it is true that all of the loose ends are tied up, but again, by that time you don't really care.
B001VNB54A|4.0|It's been a few months since the final episode of The Pacific miniseries on HBO aired.  I watched all 10 episodes this spring and thoroughly loved them all.  Some were better than others, as is always the case, but as a series, it's right up there with Band of Brothers (2001).  Of course I have to give slightly better marks to Band of Brothers, which is simply one of the best miniseries ever created in my opinion...other than Lonesome Dove (1989), which was my favorite until Band of Brothers.  I think Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, as Producers on both The Pacific and Band of Brothers series, simply understand how to tell great war stories.  Spielberg started this war movie/story fascination of his with his film Empire of the Sun (1987), which I consider to be one of his best movies and the best movie performance in Christian Bale's career.  He continued his powerful war story development with his Oscar-winning film Schindler's List (1993), which to this day is a movie that haunts me and that I can only watch very rarely due to the dark horrors it shows.  And finally the trifecta hit with Saving Private Ryan (1998), which in my opinion was robbed of its Best Picture Oscar, even though I do think Shakespeare in Love (1998) was a terrific movie that year as well.<br /><br />The Pacific was beautifully shot and the production design is outstanding.  The cinematography and editing are top notch.  There was never a doubt in my mind that what I was seeing on the screen was what was probably seen by my Grandfather and the thousands of other soldiers who fought WWII in the Pacific.  My Grandfather was shot on Iwo Jima early in that battle and took his stories from his WWII experience to his grave.  He never really shared that part of his life with his son (my Uncle) or his family.  But watching The Pacific, I feel like I have a small sense of what he must have experienced.<br /><br />What's so interesting to me about this miniseries is the way the episodes unravelled the stories of the 3 main characters.  Some of the episodes were basically just love stories and others were mostly battle scenes filled with death and horror.  But it was all weaved together so wonderfully.  And I was surprised at how I found myself losing track of the time as I watched and got in the shoes of the characters.  I have to say that my favorite episode was actually number 8 entitled \\"Iwo Jima\\".  And while it has some battle scenes, it's mainly the story of one man meeting this woman he falls in love with and marries.  I just escaped into that episode and was left wanting more at the end.<br /><br />I recently got the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer for this series and it is fantastic! If you like original movie scores, this is one of the best.  Zimmer is definitely my favorite modern movie music composer and he lives up to his incredible body of work with this soundtrack.  I have a feeling I will be revising my Top10 Soundtrack list to include this one at #10 instead of The Insider, which is hard to do...but The Pacific is simply Top10 worthy in my opinion for music scores, so I have to make room somewhere!main characters.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Putting that 5 stars it deserves up there before the haters start trashing it. :)
B001AVCFK6|3.0|The recent Star Trek (2009) movie reboot by writer/director J.J. Abrams was not everything I hoped for, but it was still a decent movie for the 11th film in the franchise. I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. I was really excited to see this movie when it came out last year. The trailers and movie posters definitely look cool and slick, which enticed and excited me. And the fact that one of the creators of Lost and Alias was behind this franchise makeover was a big selling point too. The production design and cinematography in the movie are very well done...with just a few too many lens light flares I think. I really noticed them more on my 2nd viewing at home...and they started bugging me by the end of the film. The plot of the story and the writing were well done too. And of course the special effects were top notch.<br /><br />I think the main thing that keeps me from really loving this movie is the acting. I feel like most of the actors are trying too hard to mimic the original actors and characters. Chris Pine feels like he's playing William Shatner playing James T. Kirk. And the same is true for the actors playing the characters Spock, Bones, Scotty, and Chekov. So I'm guessing that this was director Abrams approach to the movie. It feels a little \\"cheesy\\" to me going this route. I would have preferred to see a \\"darker\\" more dramatic and serious take on these characters like Christopher Nolan has done with the Batman franchise. But too be honest, I'm not sure anyone can ever capture this series better than the original actors did in the first six Star Trek movies. And that is why I think Gene Roddenberry went in a different but similar direction with all his spin-off series (Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, etc.), using new characters instead of trying to get new actors to play the original characters.  Part of it is the time when those original Star Trek movies came out and the chemistry between those original actors that embodied and owned these characters. The cheesiness that those actors brought to their characters in those movies felt more genuine. I mean who can deny that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) is pretty \\"cheesy\\"...and yet it's one of the best and most popular of the Star Trek movies. Whereas in this remake, the cheesiness feels artificial...again like they are mimicking the original series. But I will say that this movie was more successful in my eyes than the series of Next Generation Star Trek Movies that populated the 7th through 10th films in this franchise. For me the first 6 Star Trek films are the best of the franchise, with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn (1982) being the benchmark that all others must live up to.<br /><br />On a broader note, I think Hollywood's current obsession with remaking every halfway decent and popular TV Show, Super Hero Comic, Book, Toy, or Movie franchise is really wearing thin. The last 10-20 years have just felt like nearly everything coming out of Hollywood in terms of blockbuster movies is a retread of something already created. How many different takes on Batman or Superman or Whatever can we take? Original content movies like Inception are the exception. I realize that there's always a new generation of younger people that don't know the original material, so these remakes are often targeted at them, along with the diehard and cult fans that will go see whatever movie has a name they recognize on it. But I for one am anxiously awaiting the return of original new material to the mainstream of Hollywood filmmaking. I do think that eventually Hollywood will see past remaking the Dukes of Hazard for the 13th time. Or Transformers 49.  But until then, I'm happy to see the few gems that do come out of all of these remakes and this new Star Trek is a great looking and feeling film. It definitely gives the Star Trek world a slick modern look that can't be matched by any of the older material. I just wish the characters and actors inhabiting this slick modern world had thedepth that the originals had. But we'll see what Abrams does with the next Star Trek film. I can't wait to see it!riginals had. But we'll see what Abrams does with the next Star Trek film. I can't wait to see it!
B002HR1W1K|5.0|Not much else can be said, it's a great movie with high \\"rewatchability\\", and enough extras to keep you busy for quite some time. Edgar Wright is a great film-maker and his knowledge of film really shows. His commentary with Simon Pegg is great and I love hearing him and Quentin talk about movies for awhile. If you like the movie, this a must buy, if you've never seen it or aren't familiar with it, I say give it a shot.
B001OQCV2O|3.0|One genre of movies that seems to keep growing every year is the disaster/apocalypse genre. I think this genre is so popular in Hollywood as well as with the public because this is where a lot of the summer blockbuster movies come in. Who doesn't like seeing stuff blown up or destroyed, right?! Disaster flicks usually have lots of special effects too (whether old school movie magic or new school cgi). And a lot of people currently seem to be obsessed with technology. I for one always start at the same place with a movie...THE STORY. Am I interested in the story? Does the story have a plot? Is the plot any good? And do the characters interest me? IF I can answer yes to at least one of these questions (if not all), THEN I get interested in seeing the movie. Of course the trailer is where you get a sneak peak and see if you can answer one of those questions.<br /><br />2012 always seemed like a rip-off of Armageddon (1998) and Deep Impact (1998) to me since I first saw the trailer. Both of those movies were inspired by the year 2000 as it approached and the supposed end of the world with that year. And 2012 is out in preparation for the end of the world again in 2012 according to Mayan lore. The trailer did look interesting visually, so I decided to watch the movie recently since it came out on HBO or Starz (I can't remember which). I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was pretty good. I give it 3 out 5 stars. I felt it dragged on a little bit at 2-1/2 hours, but I kept getting pulled back into the story and the characters. Director Roland Emmerich is probably most famous for Independence Day (1996), also dipping its toes in the disaster genre, but from an alien/sci-fi perspective. And I think ID4 (as it is also known) is the better of the two movies. It has better actors...and I think aliens as the enemy instead of the calendar is a better premise. But I will say the cgi effects are good in 2012.

B00275EGX8|3.0|I recently revisited The Hurt Locker (2008) in HD. As the Best Picture Oscar winner of 2009, The Hurt Locker is definitely a good movie well worth watching...and an important movie about our current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's a film that explores some of the psychological effects that modern warfare has on the soldiers fighting these wars, specifically the soldiers that disarm bombs. Our current wars don't have the same cut-and-dry sides that WWII did, when the good guys and bad guys were more clearly defined. But war is still war at its most basic levels, and every war means that the soldiers have to deal with killing and death.<br /><br />My appreciation of The Hurt Locker has not changed in the last year since I first saw the film on DVD and reviewed it. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5. Having now seen 6 out of the 10 nominated Best Picture films for 2009, along with a bunch of other 2009 films not nominated for Best Picture, I'm not so sure that The Hurt Locker deserved to win Best Picture of 2009. I do think it was deserving over Avatar, which was visually and technologically incredible, but empty in terms of its story and characters. But my pick for best picture of 2009 is the underrated and not nominated A Single Man by director Tom Ford, followed by (500) Days of Summer and Crazy Heart. And out of the group of war films in 2009, I think Brothers was just slightly better than The Hurt Locker, The Messenger, and Inglourious Basterds. But all 4 of these war films are worthy of viewing. It's not my intention to harp on whether or not The Hurt Locker was awards-worthy, but I thought I'd share my opinions here since I've now seen enough films from 2009 to render an opinion.<br /><br />What I will emphasize that is brilliant about The Hurt Locker is the documentary-style cinematography and storytelling. Screenwriter Mark Boal, a journalist who was embedded with troops in Iraq during the war, brings a realism and depth to the story and its characters that feels authentic. Certainly parts of the movie are dramatized and Hollywood-ized as all fiction films are, but for the most part, you feel like you are right there in Iraq with the soldiers. The production design is flawless, with that same sun-bleached dusty desert look that we've become accustomed to in war movies about the middle east from the past 10 years. That look and feel really goes back to the excellent film Three Kings (1999), which was one of the first middle-eastern set \\"war\\" films, along with Courage Under Fire (1996). And it continued with Ridley Scott's excellent film Black Hawk Down (2001).<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that Director Kathryn Bigelow deserved her Best Directing Oscar. She's a very talented woman in what is generally a man's field. And for her to have made the statements she's made with her films over the years, she deserves Academy recognition. And of course we were well overdue for our first female Best Director. I do think Point Break (1991) is her best film, with The Hurt Locker at #2. Her Oscar win, like so many, is really for her body of work. The Hurt Locker was simply the film that pushed her over the edge into winning.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my previous review, the three main actors, led by Jeremy Renner, are very good in this film, even though their characters seem a little empty and distant at times. Of course one could argue that they are that way because that's how these soldiers are and have to be to do their job. They can't get too emotional or involved, but instead stay \\"distant\\" to protect themselves. I do buy that argument, but this is still a movie, and for me to care about the characters, I need to be able to understand and feel who they are and what they are up to. There are moments in the film that provide that, but they are connected by long spells without it.<br /><br />The pacing and editing of The Hurt Locker are very solid and at times brilliant. Using multiple cameras to shoot various scenes in the film, the filmmakers apparently had a million feet of film to work from to create and edit this movie. So my hats are off to the editors working hard to chip away the best of all the material captured for this story. There are a few scenes where the tension and emotion are so palpable, that you just become fixed to your TV anxiously awaiting resolution. And it's those moments that elevate this film from the pack and make it good. This is simply one of those films you have to see if you're an American and a movie lover. There are definitely moments of cinematic brilliance in this film, evidenced by some of the still images below from the trailer. I just wish those moments added up to a little more.million feet of film to work from to create and edit this movie.

B003UESJJC|4.0|We watched Francis Ford Coppola's passion project Apocalypse Now (1979) last night in Cinema History class.  I had seen the movie once before in 2002.  The thing about this movie is that it's definately an \\"auteur\\" adult film.  The first time I watched it was on my old 27' Sony Trinitron TV, so I didn't get the full movie experience like I did last night in Collins College's movie theater.  The sound was absolutely incredible!  I can't remember why I was drawn to watching this movie the first time...other than the obvious \\"everbody said I should\\" excuse.  Of course I've been fascinated with war movies since high school and especially since Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line in the late 90s.  What striked me last night about Apocalypse Now was how much more accessible the movie was to me upon a second viewing.  I think watching this movie for the first time, it was hard for me to really get it because it is very \\"abstract\\".  But then all of the great movies in my opinion are a bit abstract.  That's what makes them stand up over time and allows one to watch them again and again...you get something new just about every time.<br /><br />But the thought that really came to me during this viewing last night was that I didn't really enjoy or appreciate this movie as much the first time I saw it.  I watched it, thought it was decent, and moved on.  It didn't really strike me as a masterpiece of filmmaking.  But last night I really saw the greatness in this movie and its concepts.  Now maybe my movie appreciation is greater now that I'm moving into the art and business of making films.  But it's not just that.  I think more and more now that movies are something like any adult acquired taste.  I don't think anyone is born loving wine or liquor or beer...it's a taste you acquire and learn to appreciate as an adult.  And movies to me seem to be something that you appreciate the subtleties of more and more as you mature.  I think you just have to be at a certain place in you life's journey in order to really even understand some movies...like Apocalypse Now.  When you're younger and you don't yet have certain life experiences, it's harder to understand and appreciate more sophisticated movies like Apocalypse Now.  Whereas something like Star Wars or Indiana Jones or Transformers can be appreciate by kids, young adults, and grown adults.  I loved the fun of Star Wars when I was a kid.  I then appreciated it for its movie making as a young adult.  And now I get the more spiritual and moral values of the movie.  Combine all of those things and you have a masterpiece movie that you can watch over and over throughout your life.ife's journey in order to really even understand some movies...like Apocalypse Now.

B00337KMAA|3.0|I'm starting to catch up on watching recent movies and one of those movies that I've wanted to see from 2009 is Up In The Air (2009) starring George Clooney and Vera Farmiga.  Director Jason Reitman, son of Director Ivan Reitman, has crafted a great feature film for only his 3rd effort as a director.  Up In The Air was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and deservedly belonged with that group of films.  Having now seen 3 of the nominated Best Picture films (Avatar, The Hurt Locker and Up In The Air), I still feel that The Hurt Locker (2008) was probably the best of the bunch.  Although Up In The Air is a close second to me.  Clooney and Farmiga are brilliant in their acting and the writing by Jason Reitman is top notch.  I've heard Reitman say that he is most interested in dialogue in movies, and the dialogue in Up In The Air is witty and interesting.  I fell in love with Vera Farmiga as an actress when she starred in a little USA TV Show called Touching Evil (2004).  The show didn't even last a full season before getting canceled, even though it was excellent IMO.  And Farmiga, along with Jeffrey Donovan, were what made that show so appealing.  They had great chemistry, as Farmiga seems to bring to all her roles.  Of course George Clooney brings his A-game to his role as Ryan Bingham as well.<br /><br />While listening to a podcast discussion with writer/director Jason Reitman, he mentioned that what this movie is really about is this one man's journey and quest to answer the question of whether he wants to share his existence in this universe with someone.  I think the question and the answer(s) that he uncovers are perfect and I found myself very easily relating to Ryan Bingham. I think Bingham's journey through his life has been so similar to what many of us (men and women) go through in our modern culture.  We get easily wrapped up in our quest to achieve some goal, often in our career, and we lose sight of enjoying the journey to that goal.  And by the time we reach that goal, we find it less satisfying than we expected.  It's this realization that I've had for myself recently with my career, having reached the point I was striving to get to for so many years, and then being thoroughly disappointed in that achievement...especially because I didn't have anyone I wanted with me to enjoy it with.<br /><br />As an adult drama, Up In The Air is a satisfying film and I wish more movies were made at this quality level.  The cinematography and production design are brilliant on the movie.  I must say one of my favorite set designs was a condo Clooney's character buys...but it only happens in the deleted scenes on the DVD, so it's missing from the actual film.  But that condo is very cool architecturally and I wish it was in the film...but thank god for DVD extras!hat goal, we find it less satisfying than we expected.

B002ZG981E|5.0|I saw director Christopher Nolan's latest filmmaking masterpiece, Inception (2010), on Opening Day. My one word to summarize this flick is AWESOME. This is truly a stunning piece of cinema in just about every way.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars.  The story is well written, suspenseful, and interesting...the acting is top notch...the music is phenomenal (Hans Zimmer of course)...the cinematography spectacular...and the special effects are incredible.  And it's a big budget summer blockbuster that is sure to make hundreds of millions if not a billion dollars.  While this film won't beat Avatar (2009) at the box office, it's the film that I wish Avatar was.  It's the film that's better than the 10 films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 2009.  It's both an action/thriller/suspense juggernaut and a contemplative philosophical/psychological labyrinth.  It's rare now days that a movie can get me just purely excited like a kid on a sugar high, antsy to see a movie on opening day.  But also get my mind and soul intrigued and stimulated as an adult.  Inception is one of those rare movies that does that and got me into the theater on opening day...at 10 AM no less!  The last film I think that did that was Gladiator (2000).  This has got to be an Oscar contender for 2010 considering that The Dark Knight (2008), also directed by Nolan, was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 2, including Heath Ledger's posthumous win for Best Supporting Actor. And this movie far surpasses The Dark Knight in my humble opinion, as much as I enjoyed that picture as well.  My biggest quandary is now how to fit this film into my Top 100 movie list, where it definitely belongs. It's definitely the best film of 2010 so far.  And one of the best in the last decade. It's movies like this that inspire me to be both an Architect and a Filmmaker.  And ironically, this movie is a lot about architecture.  Architecture of both buildings and the mind.  I've known this for awhile, but it's so clear to me now that I became an Architect to become a Filmmaker.  My frustration with architecture in reality is that it isn't as spectacular as the architecture I build in my mind.  And movies are the place where the two meet.<br /><br />If you want a good review of the plot of this movie, read Roger Ebert's review.  I really won't even attempt to summarize this film...it would be too much work, and honestly, you just have to see it...in the theater on the big screen!  That's the power and beauty of great films is that they really defy words alone.  That's why they are on film IMO. You've got to experience them with all of your senses to fully feel them and understand them. Like the title and premise of the movie, this movie has planted ideas in my head that keep building and now I can't stop thinking about this movie, as well as its meaning for my own life.  The best films do that...they seep in to our subconscious and plant themselves there, causing god only knows what.  And there is the idea of Inception, fully realized in film as well as life itself.  Nolan has obviously crafted this story from ideas within his mind and its influences from the world of film and his own life experiences. I can definitely see the influences of his own films like Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002), both films about the psychology of the mind.  But of course there is also a bit of The Matrix (1999) and The Bourne Identity (2002) within Inception as well.  And while Inception does feel a little familiar at times because of all of its influences, I let that slide.  Film is not a static environment and filmmakers are certainly influenced by other films like any other aspect of our culture. We're really telling the same stories that the Greeks told thousands of years ago.  They've just got a different context and upgraded visuals.<br /><br />I watched Memento this afternoon as well.  I had recorded it earlier in the week on my DVR after being reminded of it from something about Inception/Nolan.  It was only the second time I've seen the movie, the first being 9 or 10 years ago when it came out on DVD.  I remember that I really didn't \\"get\\" Memento the first time and didn't really appreciate it.  The way the story was told was complex, being told both backwards and forwards at the same time, in fragments.  I think it was partly due to my young age that I just didn't appreciate Memento as much back then. But I really appreciated it today.  It's not at the same level as Inception, but the ideas at its core go hand in hand with it.  The questions of \\"reality\\" that Nolan poses in both Memento and Inception are interesting to say the least.  Memento is a much smaller scale film but I see now how influential it was now to Nolan himself, as well as the rest of the world of film. The film (500) Days of Summer, with its jumbled fragmented timeline, owes a nod to Memento. And apparently Nolan started working on the story and screenplay for Inception while filming Memento.<br /><br />There are many thoughts, ideas, and feelings that I got from Inception today going through me.  And I doubt I will fully realize them all in this blog right now.  I also think that Inception is one of those movies like The Matrix or Memento that needs to be seen a second time to get a better grasp on it. Once you get through it once, you can pay attention to details that are hard to maybe keep up with the first time when you are simply trying to stay with the story. I'm probably going to see this one again in the theater in the next few weeks. I captured a lot of screen stills from the trailers to this film...this simply such a visually stunning movie...enjoy all of them!ime I've seen the movie, the first being 9 or 10 years ago when it came out on DVD.

B001UV4XFQ|5.0|Eclispe, in my opion, is the Best of the Saga's. I have read the book a million times. However I feel the book is better. I wish I could see the movie as the book tells it. But I loved the movie anyways, but I will continue to read the book to get the parts I felt should have made it into the movie. Robert and Kristen have great Chemistry together in the movie.<br />What I would have like to have seen...is Bella Snicking off to see Jacob and Edward tailgating her starting at the boundry line until she reached Angela's house, and Edward waiting for her in her room until she got home to explain how worried he was. Also would have like to seen how Bella gets \\"held Hostage\\" by Alice per Edward after her snicking off to see Jacob, it tells how she got the yellow Turbo Pousche, it just appears in the movie and those who have not read the book wont understand how she recieved it. I also would have like to have seen Edward coming home from his \\"Trip\\" and waking Bella up and how both were so mad at each other, but then just wasn't after they saw each other after a day or two apart. During this scene I would have loved to hear and see the situation for the one liner (in the book) \\"I was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.\\"<br /><br />I also would have preferred the way Bella asked Edward to stay with her that was portraded in the book. It was more romantic. The Tent scene is my favorite of them all, but I was wanting to see bella beg for edwards to hate her after her kiss with Jacob and then Edward ripping their way out of the tent at the thoughts of Victoria and Riley approching, with him Protecting Bella, I didn't see any of that. I also wanted to see more of Charlies hatred for Edward that we didn't get to see at the End of New Moon.<br /><br />I give the movie 5stars anyways. I think the actors did a wonderful job bring the charaters to life. Still the Best movie of the saga's. I wish it followed the book, page by page, but it turned out great regardless.ook, page by page, but it turned out great regardless.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I had the following review under the new Avatar Bluray and apparently I really pissed off the diehard Avatar fans there. They wanted me to NOT review the FILM, but review the Bluray PRODUCT. Isn't the product the film?! I guess they are just buying the extras and not the feature. Weird to me, but I caved! Anyways...here's my film review under the original DVD section where it will hopefully be seen as less \\"offensive\\".<br /><br />I'm pretty sure I don't need to say much about the film Avatar (2009).  If you haven't heard of this movie by now, you're WAY unplugged from the entertainment world.  I'm surprised at myself for not seeing this movie in the theater, but I waited for Blu-Ray instead.  James Cameron's first movie since his billion dollar blockbuster Titanic (1997) is now the #1 box office movie of all time in both the U.S. and the world.  But in my humble opinion, it is not Cameron's best movie.  I still think Titanic (1997), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and The Abyss (1989) are better films.  And of course Aliens (1986) and The Terminator (1984) are on most people's lists of great Cameron films as well.  I would put Avatar somewhere in the middle of that list.  While the technology within Avatar is amazing, I don't think the storytelling was at the same level.  One thing I've come to learn about great films and great acting is that people are the key to both.  And while the Avatar characters are fully acted and voiced by talented actors, something just seems to be missing in the translation from human to avatar.  It's hard to put a finger on it really.  It's not that the artificial characters can't have the emotions and soul of a human being, because they do in movies like the original Star Wars Trilogy, but I just don't feel that they fully do in this particular movie.  Maybe it's just the story that doesn't engage the actors.  Maybe everyone was so fascinated with the technology that they lost sight of just telling the story.  I don't know the answers.  But I do know that this movie disappointed me because I wanted to love it as much or more than Titanic, Terminator 2 and The Abyss...but I just didn't.  Maybe I've changed and Avatar just isn't a movie for me anymore?<br /><br />What I will say is that you should definitely watch Avatar because it is a good movie.  And it is great filmmaking.  The movie looks incredible.  The world of Pandora that Cameron has imagined and constructed is incredible and beautiful.  And certainly no one can argue that Cameron is having an incredible impact on the business of filmmaking what with all the focus on 3D this year.  Personally I think 3D will NOT take over filmmaking like it seems to be argued by so many.  I think filmmaking will always be about the story and acting, and that the medium in which the story is told is secondary in service to the story.  I'm sure a lot of Hollywood Blockbusters will now be shot in 3D and shown in 3D, but after the fad fades a bit, we'll get back to evaluating what stories should be told in 3D and what stories should not be told in 3D.  I don't consider 3D to be as big of a game changer as color was to film.  3D has been around for 50 years or more and has recently gotten some technology breakthroughs, but as a film enthusiast and budding filmmaker, I'm not very enthralled with 3D.  Even now we still shoot some films in black & white when it serves the story.  And EVERY film's color is manipulated from reality.  Even when the film looks like reality, that was because the filmmakers color corrected the film to look more \\"real\\".  It all serves the story in the end.  That's my message.  We'll see where we are at in 20-30 years.  Maybe I'll be completely wrong!I do know that this movie disappointed me because I wanted to love it as much or more than Titanic, Terminator 2 and The Abyss...but I just didn't.

0553805371|1.0|I bought this book at Cosco after reading the inner flaps, it's only when you get into the book that you find out these two authors do not believe in divine creation. So if this is your interest by all means buy it; I believe science and God work together, meaning science proves there is a God. I took the book back to Cosco the next day.
B001PPLIFU|3.0|James Bond is back!! I know a lot of people have said that for years and for many of the past few Bond films. But I haven't really dug any Bond movie since I was a teenager when The Living Daylights (1987) and License To Kill (1989) with Timothy Dalton came out. Pierce Brosnan just didn't do anything for me as 007. I also like some of the old school Sean Connery and Roger Moore Bond movies, like Goldfinger (1964), A View To a Kill (1985), and Octopussy (1983).<br /><br />But with Quantum of Solace (2008), director Marc Forster brought some depth of character and emotional darkness to Bond that's been missing for awhile. And actor James Craig is bringing depth to the character as well.  It's no longer JUST about action and sex. And I'm certainly not saying that Bond should not have action and sex, but I think Forster brought more to the story in a better way than director Martin Campbell did with Casino Royale (2006). Even though the \\"bad guy\\" storyline in this movie is weak IMO, I still really liked the movie. I think its a movie about Bond, and that's what really interests me.<br /><br />As with any Bond movie, the action and chase scenes are top notch. I especially love watching Bond zoom down the road in his Aston Martin. The car scene in Italy is gorgeous. I was surprised that the movie didn't start with that trademark \\"James Bond walking towards the camera and then shooting at us\\" opener. And no James Bond signature music at the beginning either. I'll be honest and say that I did miss that classic Bond stuff right at the beginning. But I'll forgive the director and still give the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The photography in the film is top notch, as is the production design.  I'm amazed at all the incredible architecture shown in the film, like in many recent movies. It's great to see cool buildings whenever possible.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I purchased the blu-ray edition of \\"Let the Right One In\\" and was amazed by the quality of the film and the power of the story. First, the disc itself is relatively light on special features. But it does have all the tools you need to watch and enjoy the film.  The blu-ray features:<br /><br />English Subtitles<br />English Theatrical Subtitles<br />English Narrative Subtitles<br /><br />English Language Dub (for those out there who do not like to read movies)<br /><br />So there are plenty of options for translation to watch. The English Language Dub is surprisingly good (usually dubs are god-awful) and I found that the voice actors did a fine job of portraying the characters and the script seemed natural.  I also watched with Theatrical Subtitles which were good, natural and realistic (no verbatim awkwardness here).<br /><br />The picture itself is clear and crisp.  The shadows of a film mostly shot at night in the snow are fantastic.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a few bonus items like movie posters, stills gallery, and a very brief discussion by the director.<br /><br />The movie (Don't worry NO SPOILERS) is beautiful and heart-wrenching. I found myself horrified with the adults in the movie more than with the vampire. The vampire herself is heartbreaking and funny. Oskar's school experience is tragically all too typical.  This movie should have broad appeal: vampire without the conventions of a horror flick; unconventional relationships; unconventional coming-of-age; foreign movie that is scene driven (instead of dialog driven).
B002VECLVY|4.0|This film has left an impression on my heart and in my mind so powerfully that it intimidates me to even write about it for fear of detracting from the greatness of the movie. I saw director Tom Ford's debut masterpiece A Single Man (2009) for the first time the day it was released on DVD (July 6, 2010). I was anxiously awaiting it since I first heard about it last year and saw the trailer. I'm a huge admirer of Fashion Designer Tom Ford and when I heard he had made his first film as a director, I just knew I wanted to SEE his movie no matter what because I knew that a guy with that much style and slick image would have to create a visually stunning movie. And of course he did!<br /><br />A Single Man was filmed poetically on an old Kodak film stock that Ford and Director of Photography Eduard Grau bought the final spools of wherever they could find them around the world. That passion and craft for making this film shows in every single grainy frame of the movie from when you press play until the final credit. I'm always blogging about how visually stunning many movies are...but this one truly represents how I personally see the world and its beauty...in somber and subtle poetic detail. I find beauty in the simple details like the character George does in this movie, played astonishingly by actor Colin Firth. This is one movie where all the still images I share still don't do the film justice. You just have to see this film to revel in its incredible visual beauty. Ford's use of heavy grain from the film stock works perfectly to help convey the old school 1962 time period in which this film takes place. I bought the bluray version of the movie and it's one of those rare new movies where \\"high definition\\" doesn't really improve the movie. This movie is all about what 35mm film is to cinema, like vinyl records are to music. The perfections and imperfections are what make it great.<br /><br />If you've read anything about the story of this movie, then you know it's a serious character-driven drama...my favorite kind of movie. This movie is for people who truly appreciate the power and ability of cinema to capture the human condition and its thoughts and emotions. It's not a \\"feel good\\" movie, and yet it made me feel alive and good about film. This is a story about lost love. Colin Firth plays George, a gay English Professor in his late 40s or 50s, who loses the love of his life, Jim, played beautifully by Matthew Goode. The movie is a day in the life of George as he prepares to kill himself at the end of it. His heart is so broken that he's lost hope and his drive to live. And yet on the final day of his life, he rediscovers a passion for living through the people he interacts with, like student Kenny (played by Nicholas Hoult) and best friend Charley (played stunningly by Julianne Moore). And he rediscovers the beauty and color in the details of his life and the world around him. I won't give away the ending, but I'll tell you that it is not what I expected...and yet it seemed perfectly expected after seeing it.<br /><br />The production design for this film is perfect. From the sets and locations to the costumes and props, everything was perfectly chosen by Ford and his team of craftsmen. I just love George's black eyeglasses and his impeccable clothing. The house that George lives in is a beautiful piece of mid-century modern architecture combining both simplicity and warmth. Of course George's partner Jim was an architect, as the movies are so fond of using as a profession for characters. As an Architect, I will admit that I love the admiration the movies have for architects...and a part of me always lights up when I hear or see someone playing an architect in a film.<br /><br />After watching A Single Man back on July 6, I immediately bought it on bluray the next day, along with the soundtrack from iTunes. I instantly knew this film belonged not only in my movie and music collections but in my Top 100 movies of all time. Music Composers Abel Korzeniowski and Shigeru Umebayashi crafted the most incredible poetic soundtrack for this film. The opening credit sequence starts with the song \\"Drowning\\", which is an eery orchestral piece that's perfectly accompanied to the naked underwater images of Colin Firth \\"drowning\\". But the first song of the soundtrack titled \\"Stillness of the Mind\\", is the music that makes my soul weep every time I hear it. The violin solo and backing orchestra are so tender and emotional in their playing of this lovingly crafted piece of music. It just pulls feeling out of its listeners and makes them pay attention to both the joy and sadness within themselves. This soundtrack was grossly overlooked by the Academy...it should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Music (Original Score).<br /><br />To be honest, this movie was grossly overlooked in several categories by the Oscars, except for Colin Firth's nomination for Best Actor. A Single Man should have been nominated for Art Direction, Cinematography, and Editing as well.  I think the main reason this film was overlooked by the Academy is the same reason it was overlooked by the public. On the surface, it's a \\"gay\\" movie about a gay man and was directed by a gay man. And yet this movie has nothing really to do with sex. It could as easily be told about a straight man. It's simply a story about lost love. But mainstream America is still unable to see past things that appear to be gay or have a gay feel to them, and A Single Man is simply a victim of that bias. But I have a feeling this film will stand the test of time and that people will discover it and appreciate it over the years to come. And whatever next film Tom Ford makes will surely pull more fans into his work who'll discover this treasure as well. I for one am extremely anxious to see what masterpiece Ford crafts for his second feature film. His debut was brilliant and will be hard to live up to. But if anyone can do it, Tom Ford seems to be the man. He's a perfectionist like myself and simply won't settle for much less. He's switched from focusing on fashion to film as his passion, which he has said is where he can express himself more fully. And ironically, he was trained as an architect like myself.

0393072231|4.0|Eye opener to anyone who wish to begin to understand the convoluted road to the world wide financial crisis in 2008. It all began with greedy mortgage institutions practicing predatory subprime lending to people who had a high chance to default. Add in more unbridled greedy investors and evil investing companies with Goldman Sachs being the most fxxking evil of them all, useless rating agencies like standards & poor and Moodys, lack of oversight on Wall Street from a clueless government = financial Armageddon.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs sold crap subprime mortgage bonds to customers and then bet against them knowing the crap will become worthless as default and foreclosures happened. Evil beyond any redemption.<br /><br />We know now that financial Armageddon didn't happen because Wall street firms and banks were too big to fail save Lehmans Brothers. So said Obama. US government bought up all the toxic subprime assets with using 700 billions of taxpayers' money and therefore averted the cataclysmic financial doomsday.<br /><br />The Big Short truly reinforces the age old views and my views of traders, moneylenders and bankers are social parasites. They profit from buying and selling other people hard earn products but add zero real value to society. The Big Short tells us they can even package loans (subprime mortgage, car, credit cards) into risky CDOs and sell them to gullible customers and some even bet on them to fail as did Goldman Sachs. Pure evil.<br /><br />Honest living comes from getting down and dirtying ones hands with real work.
B001794FOK|4.0|I watched Jumper (2008) for a second time this week, having seen it for the first time when it came out on DVD a year or two ago.  I really liked the movie when I first saw it, but I love it even more now.  I've got it on my Top 200 Movie list.  It's one of the few films of the last decade that I can honestly say I wish was quite a bit longer.  It's only 88 minutes and it just flies through those few minutes leaving you wanting more...hence Jumper 2 which is in development now.  Another 30 minutes could easily be added to this flick.  The story is simply so intriguing that I felt that more back story and character development could have been included.  But I also appreciate that director Doug Liman gave us a great short film that never seems to have any dead spots for bathroom breaks.  Liman really changed action movie making IMO with The Bourne Identity (2002), which absolutely blew me away when I saw it on DVD.  It still blows me away at how good that movie is when I see it now.  Liman really crafted a new standard for the thinking man's action movie with The Bourne Identity and then Jumper.  Director Paul Greengrass amazingly took Liman's model and made it even better in the Bourne sequels The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).<br /><br />Back to Jumper...the story is a combination of sci-fi, action and drama.  The blend is perfect because it all seems so believable within the framework of the movie.  It's probably good that Liman doesn't get into explaining how the teleporting is possible, because that might just take away from the story.  Actors Hayden Christensen and Jamie Bell seem perfectly suited to their characters, as does Samuel Jackson as the \\"bad guy\\".  Even Rachel Bilson as the love interest in the film is good casting, in sharp contrast to the eye candy status of Megan Fox in Transformers (2007).  Don't get me wrong, Megan Fox is gorgeous looking in Transformers...but that's about it.  Whereas Rachel Bilson is gorgeous looking in Jumper, but she's also a talented actor and shows it in this film.<br /><br />Of course part of what always makes a good action/drama flick is the filming on location.  And Jumper impresses on that level as well.  The cinematography is brilliant and amazingly Liman got limited access to film in the actual Colosseum in Rome...a rare feat for filmmakers.  The Colosseum scenes are impressive for their beauty.  Apparently they had to film those scenes using only natural light since Colosseum Officials wouldn't allow them to set-up equipment on the ground.  So the shots are all handheld with natural light.<br /><br />Bottom line is that Jumper is a great film., but she's also a talented actor and shows it in this film.

0618918248|5.0|Many have said of this book that 'Bestsellers come & Bestsellers go' & that as Time passes, religions will recover their former prominence. There is even a book called 'God is Back', proudly proclaiming the end of this books long shadow.<br /><br />It is true that Time does indeed fade things & books like [[ASIN:0415325102 Why I am Not a Christian]] by Bertrand Russell become less bracing as culture changes. However not all things fade and (3 years on) this book still makes for addictive reading. Open any page, and you have to read the whole of it - it is still bracing, potent & resolutely true.<br />The main thrust of the book doesn't look likely to fade quickly either unless (as Alister McGrath has suggested) evolution & science is turned upside-down by new evidence.<br /><br />On top of this, debating with fellow reviewers & reading the 'fleas' has convinced me that the book is still potent enough to incite reviews from people who dare not read it! Furthermore, the essential arguments still make a lot of sense & ironically the 'fleas' seem to read like the ones avoiding the elephant in the corner...<br /><br />There is also the fact that this has been a life-changing work as, once you see that God really is Hocus Pocus, there is no turning back. It is perfectly possible that people (like Derren Brown) will be recommending this book to all & sundry when the topic of religion comes up, regardless of whether it is still topical.<br /><br />So, maybe this book will fade with time, who knows? What is certain though is (barring some scandal involving Dawkins or God appearing so as to remove any doubt) this book will remain useful stuff for atheists & scary stuff to the faithful...<br /><br />Magic Lemur<br />December 2009
B002RVZV9U|4.0|I fell in love with this movie in the first minute.<br /><br />I fell in love with this movie simply from the title...it MIGHT get loud.<br /><br />I fell in love with this movie because in my mind music is what's there when there are no words.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is its simplicity.  It's a love affair with music...specifically the electric guitar...and three of its hereos: Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin, The Edge from U2 and Jack White from The White Stripes & The Raconteurs.  These three musical artists are unbelievable!  I was already enamoured with Jimmy Page and The Edge, but the surprise of this film for me was how much I fell in love with Jack White and his story.  I've heard White's music but it never seemed to connect very strongly with me until today while watching this movie.  I think it was the stripping of him down to his musical core that got me.  Like so many things, I fall in love with the story of a person.  I fall in love with the dramatization of that story as well.  I'm simply a sucker for a great story...that's where my art starts.<br /><br />Because this movie is very experiential like a concert, you can't capture it in static words like in this review.  So just watch the movie and turn the volume up!  I will say that the title sequence on this movie is one of my favorites ever.  It is just so clean and powerful seeing close-up details of these incredible guitars with \\"rock-n-roll\\" fonts \\"etched\\" in the visuals.  Very cool stuff!
B000MKXEME|5.0|Often with B movies & horror movies of old (e.g. [[ASIN:B00005YJMX Nosferatu]]), the film fails to hit the right notes. Either the horror is dated & corny or the director has flashes of genius, but no consistency.<br /><br />Thankfully this is not true with this film. Starring the guy who played 'Weyoun' in [[ASIN:B000NTPCGU Star Trek - Deep Space Nine]], the film has that unnerving quality & goriness that makes truly great horror. Jeffrey Combs' character grips you from his very first line (the title of this review) & his weirdness is never too extreme, staying within the realm of the understandable (just...)<br /><br />Furthermore there are also the other actors/ actresses who are convincing and never have any 'B-movie moments' (when you can tell they're reading a script!) Unusually for this type of film, you actually become interested in the plot as all the performances are fleshed out & deep, which is not true of say [[ASIN:B000WC3864 The Evil Dead]] (great film though it is).<br /><br />About the goriness, I felt this movie hit the nail on the head. The gore is not sparse & timid, but nor is it an overdose or 'the gore, the merrier'. Each bit of squeamishness is used efficiently, but not overplayed & this is refreshing from an era of 'video-nasties' that tended toward cliched over-emphasis.<br /><br />I can honestly think of little to criticise in this film. There are the odd bits that strain credulity (e.g. the baddie not losing his mind when resurrected) & there is little music (except the intro/outro song, which is compelling).<br /><br />And since I can find little to criticize in this film, I have no hesitation in recommending it to horror fans everywhere.<br />Of course, you should bear in mind that it is horror (not suitable for young-ones or women who don't like scary films) & there are some nude scenes. You should also read some of the other reviews (for balance).<br />However, I can honestly say there is nothing I have found in my searches that would stop me endorsing this as a truly great horror film.film.
B001EO748M|4.0|The latest TV show I've been catching up on is Showtime's sexy series The Tudors about King Henry VIII of England and his various wives.  I'm almost through watching Season 2 out of the three seasons that have aired so far.  The Tudors is a visual wonderland of architecture, landscape, and fashion.  The costumes and make-up work are unbelievable in their creative and colorful design...as is so often the case in these period pieces.  While the show does take some creative license with the accepted factual history of Henry VIII and the various characters surrounding him, I for one don't really care.  The reality is that when you make a story into a movie or a dramatic television show, you have to make the story and the characters work for the viewer to be entertained and interested.  So I find that if I am enjoying the story, I'm ok with it only being \\"true\\" on screen or \\"based\\" on a true story.  I think some filmmakers are so careful to be 100% faithful to \\"fact\\" that they craft a boring movie that is true instead of an interesting movie that stretches the \\"truth\\".  At the end of the day, we really don't know what actually happened almost 500 years ago.  Historians are now known to record history with a pretty biased point of view...even in today's modern world with millions of points of view.<br /><br />Along with the look and design of The Tudors, the acting is phenomenal and the show has a very sexy and modern feel to it.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers is perfectly suited to Henry VIII and Natalie Dormer is seductively thrilling as Anne Boleyn.  This show reminds me of one of my other favorite historical films made in recent years: Elizabeth (1998) starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush.  Directed by Shekhar Kapur, Elizabeth is really the stylistic pre-cursor to The Tudors series.  It's the story of King Henry VIII's controversial daughter with his second \\"illegitimate\\" wife Anne Boleyn, so in terms of story, it's a \\"sequel\\", but without Elizabeth, I doubt The Tudors would exist.<br /><br />Queen Elizabeth I was the first woman monarch to rule with the respect, love and fear of a King.  And Cate Blanchett made her mark as Elizabeth, and as an actress, with this role.  Shakespeare in Love (1998) won the Best Picture Oscar in 1998, but I think Elizabeth was actually the better overall film of the two...both movies are good though.  And Saving Private Ryan was the movie that should have won the Oscar that year!  I'm still burning mad at that controversial best picture race.udors would exist.

B000068IEU|2.0|Many people claim this film to be something of a cult classic - something on a par with [[ASIN:B0007N1B7Q Mean Streets]] or [[ASIN:B000GL18J0 The Evil Dead]] - as a film from a great director before he sold out and became famous.<br /><br />Do not be fooled - it is nothing of the sort!<br /><br />This film has appalling acting, a rubbish plot and an outdated sense of what is shocking. All these are forgivable in a film just as [[ASIN:B000GQMLXM Nosferatu]] can be forgiven. However, there is something so typically Wes Craven in this film, like the later [[ASIN:B000056N4S A Nightmare On Elm Street]]'s that does things shoddily and 'shockingly' when really they weren't even really bad at the time.<br /><br />I wish I could say this was a diamond in the rough and, indeed, there are some redeeming qualities in it (the chainsaw bit at the end). Unfortunately its affectatious ways and generally illucid dialogue mean it deserves its non-cult status.<br /><br />P.S. With the release of the new Wes Craven version of this, you may be tempted to watch this one. However, just because a film is re-released doesn't make it good. Personally, I feel it reveals more about the director's *lack* of originality & desire to earn money for nothing.<br /><br />After all, would you re-release [[ASIN:B00005B75C The Shining]] or [[ASIN:B000GL18J0 The Evil Dead]]? Dear God, I hope not!
B0019EXZYE|3.0|The Bank Job (2008), director Roger Donaldson's latest feature film, reminds me visually of his film Thirteen Days (2000) starring Kevin Costner.  It has that same cinematic look and tone to the movie.  Thirteen Days was set in the 60s during the Cuban Missile Crisis and The Bank Job is set in the 70s.  What I love about Donaldson's last few films is how carefully crafted the periods in which they were set comes through in the movie.  Donaldson is one of the few older directors whose work continues to improve and contribute to the craft of filmmaking (like Clint Eastwood). The Bank Job has a great ensemble cast led by Jason Statham, and the story really zips along in this film. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film since my expectations were low with Jason Statham.  Statham usually starts in a typcial Hollywood action vehicle with lots of special effects and car chases.  But he really shines in this role and shows his dramatic acting ability that I felt in The Transporter (2002) movie.<br /><br />Roger Donaldson has created another great movie in line with my other favorites of his:  The World's Fastest Indian (2005), The Recruit (2003), Thirteen Days (2000), Dante's Peak (1997), Cocktail (1988), and No Way Out (1987).  The best of filmography in my opinion is Thirteen Days, a very finely acted and crafted film about JFK during the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  But the rest of his films I've listed are right up there as well.  Check out The Bank Job.
B000286RNY|4.0|As the cliche goes, this is a film of two halves.<br /><br />The first half is funny, witty, ground breaking stuff - a Kung Fu film that you laugh with and not at. I was amazed at the sharpness of the occasionally surreal comedy and of the fast paced and clever script, that surprised and amazed in equal measure.<br /><br />However, the scene where our hero chats up the female lead is the 'Jump the Shark' moment, where the film turns from ground breaking to cliched and predictable. All the special effects in the world can't make the final match work, and the whole enemy-team-on-drugs ploy doesn't explain why they are so much better than the Shaolin monks.<br /><br />Anyways, the film is definitely worth watching as all new experiences are to be cherished and honoured. Just beware that, like [[ASIN:B00028493Y Girl Next Door]], it is possible for a film to lose it's rhythm half way and seem cut-and-shut...<br /><br />P.S. On an unrelated sidenote, [[ASIN:B000FQVX78 Star Wars VI - Return of the Jedi]] fans among you may be interested to know that the ideas of the Jedi and 'The Force' were partly derived from the Shaolin Monks of China...
B002ZG99NG|4.0|I just saw Ben Affleck's new movie The Town (2010). Absolutely GREAT movie (4 stars out of 5)! It's Affleck's best acting since Good Will Hunting (1997), after years of fair and piss poor acting gigs. The Town is a \\"classic\\" Hollywood crime/heist/caper movie that follows in the footsteps of Heat (1995), Point Break (1991), Goodfellas (1990), and The Departed (2006). It doesn't have any snazzy new special effects like all the latest Hollywood blockbusters, but this is just good solid movie storytelling. It's clear to me that when Ben writes his roles, he plays his roles the best. And to add direction into the mix, he hit the perfect trifecta with The Town as writer/director/actor. Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone (2007), with his brother Casey Affleck in the lead role, is also worth checking out. Both Affleck's were in fine form on that flick. It's not quite at the same level as The Town, but it's a darn good movie (3.5 stars out of 5).<br /><br />I can't say the photography in The Town stood out from the pack, but the movie looked good, gritty and realistic (as the stills below show). The production design made you feel like you were right there in Baaahh-stun (Boston). What strikes me most about The Town is simply good old school movie making on the whole. And that's what I like about this movie. Jeremy Renner is fantastic in his role as Ben Affleck's best friend. He's absolutely believable AND over the top, but you love him for it. Renner's acting in this film is a notch above The Hurt Locker, where I also thought he shined. But in The Hurt Locker, Renner is understated and subtle in his acting compared to The Town. We've now seen an interesting range of skill from Renner and I have a feeling his newly juiced-up career will pay off for years to come, along with Ben Affleck. Jon Hamm plays the good guy in the film, an FBI agent chasing Affleck, Renner and the rest of the crew. It's not Hamm's best work like we've seen in the AMC TV series Mad Men, but it's not bad either. It's just not as well developed of a character since this movie is really centered around the bad guys. But Hamm is good and solid.<br /><br />While elements of The Town definitely ring familiar from past movies like Heat, Point Break and even Good Will Hunting, those retreads didn't bother me in this film. I think the story and the well-developed characters kept my attention, along with the incredible action scenes and sound. Sure we've seen masked bank robbers before, like the ex-presidents in Point Break, and the magic number of 4 bank robbers in a crew in both Heat and Point Break. Maybe it's just been enough time since those classic 90s movies that it feels nicely retro. And for some reason, I never tire of shoot-em-up scenes in a downtown setting with incredible rapid fire gunplay sounds blasting through the speakers. All in all, The Town is one of the best films of 2010 so far, next to Inception, which is at the top of my list. I hope to see some Oscar love thrown at The Town, but it may get overlooked if the competition heats up with the rest of the movies released in the next 3 months. We'll see!d either.

B000HDZAY6|5.0|There are many who say that this album is 'too short' and that it should include songs like [[ASIN:B001MXXYY8 Stay Young]], [[ASIN:B001MYE8J2 All Around The World]] etc. Personally I disagree - I say that this is an ace best of and the envy of most other bands out there.<br /><br />The songs on there meld near seamlessly, which is a hard thing to do as I know from compilation writing. In fact its eerie how well [[ASIN:B001N15BNQ The Importance Of Being Idle]] blends so well with [[ASIN:B001MXONXE Wonderwall]] - you could almost think it was from the same album! The songs themselves are also the real classics, without including all the tunes that have unpleasant memories associated with them (e.g. [[ASIN:B000007UO4 D'you Know What I Mean?]] being the harbinger of their 1997 downfall, even though in itself it is a good tune).<br /><br />In fact, to add to this point, it is neat how Oasis have airbrushed their history. It is notable that the first sycophant in the booklet excludes the whole of [[ASIN:B00004RJLD Be Here Now]] and instead goes on to Oasis' latest stuff. Although this is high pretentiousness, it does make sense in a way to ignore the bad bits, or the reminders of the bad bits (e.g. [[ASIN:B001MYGL1U Gas Panic!]] and even [[ASIN:B001MY0OK4 Little By Little]]).<br /><br />As a best of, the album does the job in that it shows a tempting morsel of the best and sacrifices the ones that may taint the picture even if they were Great. I would also add that my favourite album is Standing on the Shoulders (which is barely included) but I think its depth would be poorly spent on what should be an otherwise radiant collection.
0307716988|5.0|I was already so happy with the price of the book since I had been looking to purchase it but wasn't able to afford it elsewhere. Then I found it on Amazon and I just about cried when I received the book. It has Michael Jackson's signature inside. It was truly a surprise and made my purchase all the more worth it!
B00003CXIP|5.0|This film was recommended to me 5 years ago and I had fully intended watching it, but never got round to it. However, having seen the video for 'Stand by Me' on the Vault, I was drawn to the movie for the entirely shallow reason that the song was good and it had clips of the film attached!<br /><br />Of course the problem, at this point, is that films which you expect to be good frequently disappoint. (You need only think of [[ASIN:B000062V91 The Matrix Reloaded]] or [[ASIN:B00005MFPJ Star Wars I - The Phantom Menace]] to know that feeling...)<br /><br />Fortunately, this film DID live up to the long wait! It had all the wondrous writing of Stephen King, a non-cheesy, uplifting plot and sensational characters who were really engaging. It is plain, and easy to see why River Phoenix has the cult status he does, and also why this film is upheld as a seminal coming-of-age film.<br /><br />Of course, there are weaknesses, as the 2 star reviewer states. The weakness I'd highlight is Stephen King's incredibly annoying habit of putting himself in a story. Gordie would have been a far better character, if it weren't for his untouchable nature. This also means that he has the only part that has a happy ending (not to plot spoil), which is a little indulgent.<br /><br />However I would rate this film still, even with this minor weakness. And I would salute it for the fact that it avoids the cliche of many films of having a eponymous title song, which is then shamelessly used throughout (e.g. in [[ASIN:B000058E3F An Officer And A Gentleman]]). This film saves 'Stand by Me' (the song) for the titles at the end, and so quadruples its power (and makes you remember it for days after!)<br /><br />So, if you have this film at #3894 on your wishlist and are wondering whether it is worth seeing, then learn my lesson - it is and should be seen as a priority over all other films. Watch it, and find satisfaction at the end of longing...
0316098337|4.0|I like a unique perspective, but was still concerned with how much depth a book could have when written entirely from a five-year olds perspective.  But, my fears were allayed almost immediately as Jack, the just turned five year old, drew me into the only world he'd ever known - a small room in which he and his mother have been held.<br /><br />Donoghue with great skill creates a turn-paging tale in which looking through a child's eye brings whole new meaning to contemplating what is of true value and what is sometimes sacrificed in dealing with an ever-changing, fast-paced world.<br /><br />I've held off giving this 5-stars - though I think it's somewhere above 4-stars -simply because a few times as the story progresses I did find that I was pulled out of it when Jack made observations that I didn't think were consistent with what it seemed from earlier parts of the book he should have been familiar with through his exposure to the world through TV and other events in the Room. However, these didn't hinder it from being a great, all-around read.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A great, unique psychological thriller that's a fast, page turning reading with some more complex themes to contemplate and depth of characters to care about.  Highly recommended.
0743268091|4.0|As an apprentice non-believer, I have taken to reading the New Atheists and this was essentially the last of the major ones to read (bar [[ASIN:0141017775 Breaking the Spell]]). I was expecting a good read but what I got was an extraordinarily lucid book (which was so articulate and clear in its ideas that I swear I ran through two pens with underlining it!)<br /><br />It starts on good form, with an imaginative scenario about a suicide bomber in a major city & draws the reader into the need for this argument to be addressed. His argument then roams far & wide, but mostly sticks with the theme of Islam's links to terrorism and the nature of religious extremism.<br /><br />While it doesn't attempt to disprove of God (like [[ASIN:055277331X The God Delusion]]) or study all religions (like [[ASIN:1843545748 God is Not Great]]), this book does provide a rich swathe of useful material in the case against God and is clear-headed in its philosophical discourse (which is rare in a normally woolly subject).<br /><br />My one criticism (and reason for not giving it 5 *'s) is that Mr Harris does tend to be a little Ad Nauseam in his general approach. While all books on religion tend to get a bit mucky in their tactics, this one is especially so in exploring the links between Nazism & Christianity (while admittedly ignoring the supposed Darwin-Hitler connection).<br />He also tends towards the 'nasty verses' approach to scripture/ [[ASIN:0140449205 The Koran]], which has some merit, but is pointless when he makes such a good case in other ways.<br /><br />So, although this book is worth a read for its ideas on meditation, religion & a wide variety of current philosophical topics, it is a little bit too litigious and dark for people who want crisp reasoning likely to encourage others to come out as non-believers.<br /><br />That said, if you are already on the path then this book is worth a read if you want to discover new insight into atheism.<br />The last chapter of the book (and indeed the conclusion to the book) is especially powerful and the enlightened analogies (e.g. the Credit Card test) will mean this book is likely to withstand the test of time...rful and the enlightened analogies (e.g. the Credit Card test) will mean this book is likely to withstand the test of time...

B000002NJL|5.0|A few years ago, I went to an Edinburgh Festival version of [[ASIN:080215011X Sexual Perversity in Chicago]]. It was a mediocre version, but what was interesting about it was that the director had clearly heard this soundtrack and liberally used it throughout the play to add atmosphere and a sense of style to an otherwise limited performance.<br /><br />And that's the brilliant thing about this soundtrack - it is the best thing about the film to the point where the film seems like a music video for it! The songs are rich in ethos & varied, so that there are always new angles to discover on each of the tracks. Furthermore, you can use the songs to add texture to any endeavor and end up with a masterpiece!<br /><br />For instance, there is the song [[ASIN:B001J09I8K Across 110th Street]], which is a rags-to-riches soul song. Then there is [[ASIN:B0027RA4JQ Street Life]], which is loud, brash Motown and finally there is 'The Lion & the Cucumber', which defies description! All the songs are the 1 in 10,000 variety that are good on their original albums, but utterly amazing put together on one album.<br /><br />As for dialogue, it has been said that it is not as plentiful on this soundtrack as on [[ASIN:B00006H1ER Pulp Fiction]] and [[ASIN:B00002M66E Reservoir Dogs]]. That is true, but what is on here is intriguing enough.<br />Track 2 is recognizable for anyone who's heard the song off [[ASIN:B00000JOYY Human Traffic]] (as it contains the sample used for \\"It ain't Gonna be me\\").<br />Track 4 is a bit I missed on the film, but is about Samuel L. Jackson's collection of 'Beach Bunnies' that he keeps in L.A. Rather like the 'Royale with Cheese' scene in [[ASIN:B000X4ZGJ8 Pulp Fiction]], it is a classic example of Tarantino using screen-time on dialogue, rather than just moving the plot along with it.<br />Finally, Track 15 is the pick of the bunch, with the classic Tarantino line \\"Smoking weed will rob you of your ambition...\\" \\"Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV!\\"<br /><br />This all said, there are weaknesses with this compilation. Songs like [[ASIN:B001GVY7B0 Natural High]] and 'Inside Your Love' are brilliant, but not profound songs & become nauseating after a few listens. Equally some of the songs lack grit (e.g. 'Strawberry Letter 22') and though they are intriguing, they are also a bit wet behind the ears.<br /><br />However, get most soundtracks from films and they are 90% lame, with only a very occasional good track. On this compilation, you will find NO duds and an immense variety of surprises. Truly, it is an soundtrack that is the equal of [[ASIN:B00006H1ER Pulp Fiction]] and even [[ASIN:B000002U3P Trainspotting]].<br /><br />So, to sum up: if you're looking for the spirit and soul of Tarantino, you could do a lot worse than buying a copy of this album.with this compilation.

B000002UJQ|4.0|Radiohead are the only band I'd say who survived the 90's with a good reputation and fame. This album is a very rare thing in music; a good and successful concept album. The concept is that of taking guitars and changing their sound and Radiohead, through musical genius take those new sounds and make an album of superbly innovative music.<br /><br />There are, however, some criticisms of it I've heard since the critics turned on them and decided to reverse their judgements.<br /><br />The first is that the backing beat to [[ASIN:B001L2B8J8 Karma Police]] and [[ASIN:B001J8KLJM No Surprises]] is the same. However, Nirvana did this with [[ASIN:B001KSPGCS Polly]] and [[ASIN:B001KSRJ2S Lithium]] and [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] was great.<br /><br />The second is Radiohead write tunes which are hard to get into. I agree with this and find OK computer a bit of a flawed masterpiece as a result. It does have brilliant songs with good backing music. However, I have listened to this album hundreds of times and the message of anti capitalism or what not is as clear as mud on most of it.<br /><br />I still say it is essential to anyones music collection, but I warn you it is a hard album to know.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I have watched this series  since  the very first season, and I  have  to say it's very interesting. The script is well written and the characters play their roles well. I loved this Season Two a bit more because  of  the grimminess and portrayals of the characters. A few of the actors are well known as as Ron Pearlman and katy Segal, but others are fresh faces to the screen.
B000002JBG|3.0|Space Jam is one of my favourite films and part of the reason it is so good is its score. As a result, I've had this CD on my wishlist for over two years anticipating that it would live up to the film.<br /><br />To be fair tracks one ([[ASIN:B000002JJH Fly Like an Eagle]]), four ([[ASIN:B000042O59 I Believe I Can Fly]]) and arguably five ([[ASIN:B003I3IVJ8 Hit 'em high]]) live up to expectations, even if track four does sound strangely twee.<br /><br />However, the rest are more incidental music, from the Babylon-Zoo-esque track 3 (starts off good then goes nowhere), to the atrocious cover version of track 8 (Upside Down (Round-N-Round) by Salt-N-Pepa).<br /><br />Occasional good tracks pop up, such as track 12 ('All Of My Days') and track 2 ([[ASIN:B000002JCW Winner]]). However most of this sound track in no way lives up to the ethos of the film, and make the unforgivable omission of Techtronic's [[ASIN:B000002UVV Pump Up the Jam]], which is one of the most memorable tunes of the film.<br /><br />Considering it's price (1p second hand), this album is worth buying, if only for 2 of the songs and the memories. It would be wise, though, to learn from my error and not expect a masterpiece.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|All time favorite. I went to see Eclipse in the theater 4 times. Now I will have it for unlimited viewing.
B000000WF0|5.0|The year this came out, so did albums by Prodigy, Oasis, Blur and Radiohead. This album was *the* sound of British summer '97.<br />The sheer emotion of the lyrics and the beauty of the songs were something that hadn't been around in England since Joy Division or before.<br /><br />Songs of such intensity are still lacking today and song writers write songs that sell, not realising they can never package singing from the heart.<br /><br />This album is brilliant for love and best after a nite clubbing when you need a calm thoughtful album. Unlike some it is not too miserable and is like a Soft Rock Eminem in the way it conveys feelings in a contemplative not moaning way.<br /><br />Definitely an album 2 own if you have any pretence of music taste!
B003DZX44I|1.0|Did you hear that, everyone? Disney just opened their vault again! We better run out and buy, buy, buy before it's too late!!! I'm stunned Disney's tried and true marketing ploy continues to snag consumers (sheep) into making such impulsive decisions. Then again, \\"go out and buy this combo pack which includes a disc you don't need\\" would go over like a lead balloon, and we certainly don't want to put a crimp in Disney's bottom line.     The review is supposed to be about the movie, right? Yes and no. The movie is top notch, the product Disney is cramming down the consumer's throats is not. It's all a means to keep the price of the DVD just below the $25.00 mark. I don't own a Blu-Ray player, so the Blu-Ray disc is of no use to me. If you own a Blu-Ray player, why would you want the regular DVD especially since it reportedly has less features? I'm being forced into buying a $24.99 product of which only a portion is usable by me, and vice versa for Blu-Ray owners.    We've got to wake up and stop treating Disney as the sacred cow it thinks it is and realize their marketing department is a bunch of bull. I want to own this movie, I really do - but not on Disney's terms. If Disney decides to show its consumers some respect and release the DVD and Blu-Ray separately, then I'll buy their product.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I'm one that chooses not to go to cinemas.  I wait until movies come out on dvd.  I do my research of a movie by coming to Amazon and other sites that allow viewers to share their opinions of movies.  I look for very honest feedback from viewers.  I knew instantly that I wanted to see this movie by the trailer, but I had to make sure that it was worth my hard earned dollars.  This is why I read through each and every review on this movie, and I weeded out the trash reviews.  Reviews that really caught my attention were the ones by viewers that honestly stated that they had their prejudices, based upon seeing Jaden in an interview.  These individuals shared how they found this young man, Jaden Smith, to be arrogant, based upon how he carried himself; these viewers then shared that after taking a chance on seeing this movie, their views of Jaden had drastically changed.  I feel honored to have read these types of review, because they are the ones that truly sealed the deal for me.  I've purchased this DVD today, and I'm very pleased with it.    There were other review that I totally discarded and ignored, which were individuals that clearly demonstrated to the world that their reviews were not based upon anything other than a preference for an actor of their own race.  I encourage the viewers to read through each review carefully, before allowing yourselves to be persuaded by ignorance and bigotry.  It is ok to have preference for actors/actresses of one's own race, but don't use that as an excuse to stop others from enjoying a movie that can become a great collection piece for others, along with serving to inspire us when times get rough.  Jaden is an amazing actor in this movie.  Each moment that I watched Jaden in this movie, I knew that he was the son of Hollywood parents, but I also believed in his character, based upon very convincing facial expression of pain, lonliness and fear; that alone shows how great of an actor this kid is.  Will Smith, watch out!  Yourson will be taking many acting roles from you in a few more years.  Let's not forget that the character \\"Mr Han\\" was also a great actor in this movie.  I felt the chemistry between Mr. Han and Dre's characters.  Even the bully was played by a great young actor; I found myself hating him throughout the movie, and at the end, respecting him as much as Dre's character.    On a personal note, I love dreads and braid, because they show the natural beauty that exist within my ethnic group.  Although some in this world, as demonstrated by some of the reviews on this movie, has sometimes attempted to make me and other African Americans ashamed of our features, I'm so glad that this movie chose to allow its lead character to sport his natural hair in all its glory.    In closing, I encourage everyone to ultimately choose for themselves, if they will be purchasing or renting this movie.  Do not allow me nor anyone else to decide that for you.        Signed,     My Opinion.
B00005JA2B|5.0|I was listening to this in the car today and it brought back a lot of memories. Leftoverture finds Kansas at their creative peak. Their first 5 albums are all good, but everything comes together perfectly on this album. Kansas was not the only exponent of American prog rock in the 70's, Starcastle and Happy the Man come to mind, but they were definately the biggest and the best. Arguably better than the \\"newer\\" American prog rockers i.e.; Dream Theatre, Glass Hammer and Spocks Beard, whom they probably had a major influence on. I was lucky enough to see Kansas a couple of times, the first was in '74. They were an unknown opening act, along with Styx, at a World Series of Rock, the headliners being B.T.O., Johny Winter and Foghat, but their performance outshined all of them. Saw them again in '78 at the Canada Jam along with many other top acts of the time, their 2 1/2 hour set was mindboggling. In concert, Kansas is one of the best I have ever seen and I've been to many shows in my 50+ years. Very talented musicians. Anyways, new to Kansas ? start here, work your way backwards, then pick up Point of Know Return.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|here is a comparison of the two: Disasterpieces is more brutal, the editing is way faster and the visual experience is stimulating, plus the DVD has more features. we all know Disasterpieces is a Masterpiece, how could they top it? you might be skeptical. well, this is Sicnesses. sicnesses is technically better, the nine layers of music is more tightly knit together, everything blends together better, and the sound is excellent. this is more no-nonsense, basically what your getting is one amazing concert. the footage you've seen may have been from the web-cast, trust me, the sound is WAY better on the actuall DVD, that includes the vocals, there was an echo on the web cast that is not on the DVD, the vocals are excellent when u hear them on the DVD. this is just as good then as disasterpieces. the two dvd's work for different moods, want the most brutal concert? watch disasterpieces, want a techinically superior concert? watch sicnesses. its sooooooo good.
076790592X|1.0|The book did come in good condition.  But I ordered it on Aug 22, 2010 and didn't receive it until October 6, 2010.  That is unacceptable.  Will not order from them again!!!  I only gave it one star because I did get the book and it looks in fair to good condition. If I thought it would have taken sooo long I would not have ordered at all.
0143118420|4.0|This is a surprisingly rich & fulfilling read, although a bit wordy (nearly every page is filled with lengthy paragraphs, but are worth reading as the author is a writer by trade and her passion is evident in every word). She describes her self-discovery journey with astonishing wit and insightfulness, and painstakingly dissects piece by piece her heart & peace of mind. Bravo to Ms. Gilbert for taking the path less traveled and setting an example for the unconventional lifestyle.*
0671027344|3.0|This is a moving book, but it doesn't hit great depth.  Although this book is honest enough, I can't help but feel as though something were missing.  This is a work which is massed produced and which hits just at the boundaries of the depth we are socially allowed to feel; it doesn't go any deeper than that.  It's a safe book.  It's afraid to jump off the edge.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|It was a good movie to watch.  The voices and animation was good,  Gave it a 4 star because it just didn't WOW me.  Don't get me wrong, was better then a lot of the animated films that seem almost a dime a dozen now.  But was lacking the WOW factor to get that last star.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Highly recommended. Many real world parallels. \\"Two sides, two players, one is light, one is dark.\\" ~ John Locke, Lost, Season 1  Namaste.
0765356139|1.0|I got into Sanderson for the same reason a lot of others did - WOT. Read Mistborn and thought it was OK. Thought the magic system and associated fight scenes were pretty cool, the plot was fine. Some interesting parts.     I read the first 100 pages of this and put it down. Extreme tedium and boredom. It made me realize the weaknesses in the first book - poor character development, uninteresting characters, poor dialogue. Unfortunately pages 15-? were all of things. I simply couldn't get through it.     Also seems like the author read all the books about writing fiction and followed them = fail. Sorry fans who disagree, but I'm just not interested in any of the characters at this point.
B0026RHR6K|2.0|It's a show with some very interesting concepts but it's too far fetched.  Basically we created the Cylons to be our robotic servants and finally they rose up against us and left Caprica.  So 40 years later Cylons have developed Cylon models that look human in order to infiltrate the human race and destroy Caprica and all living humans.    The idea to destroy the human race was to assure the Cylons that humans would never enslave them again...but obviously that would never ever be possible because the Cylons are so much stronger and so far technically advanced that the human race would never be able to catch up.  So it starts off on a ridiculous idea.      Then you have Captain Adama (which is my favorite character) in charge of an old falling apart battleship with the responsibility of finding the last remaining humans a place to resettle and rebuild their lives...which is of course the planet Earth.  The story of their journey is so unbelievable that it takes away from the series.  And the most annoying character of all is Kara Thrace...an alcoholic pilot fighter that defies everyone and everything but of course she has a special relationship with Captain Adama as she was engaged to his son before he passed away so she basically gets away with anything.      Something that could have really given this show interest and a more believable story line would be if the humans encountered other aliens along the way to have joined forces with.  It's hard for me to fathom that Cylons and humans are the only living beings in the universe and that in their long journey they did not encounter any other life forms.    Also the ending of this show was a disappointment too.  When they finally reach their destination they all branch out into different groups and some even go all alone.  Their chances for survival would be very minimal...again it doesn't make much sense.      If you like sci-fi it's watchable...just wait for the price to come down to like $75.00-$100.00.  And thepackaging is terrible...the discs are very difficult to get out and back in.  The box is also big and bulky...
B002QROIMG|5.0|I'm an avid GRRM fan and although this isn't as good as Game of Thrones or Clash of Kings, it's still a great read and I love the characters in this one just as much as the last 2 books.
1427210497|5.0|When I commit to many hours listening to an audio book, I almost always want to have the author reading it. With this book -- not so much.    LeDoux seems like the perfect fit for the novel -- a reader who sounds authoritative and pleasant at the same time, a reader who is attuned to characterization without feeling the need to \\"play\\" every character. Franzen is a stylist and this reading brings this out with great success.
1603420398|3.0|I purchased this book because the cover looked really interesting.  I'm an avid knitter and crocheter and unfortunately, after spending some time with this book, I'm not very impressed. I was hoping to find some exciting new ideas for purses and the like but realize that most of these designs are a bit odd and hard to put together - in other words, good for a one off but not much more.  I wish I had purchased \\"200 crochet blocks\\" by Jan Eaton instead - I've looked at that before and although all the shapes are square, the patterns are a lot more stylish and hip - and easier to follow.
0765326353|1.0|I am stopping at page 89...I cannot force myself to continue.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Sanderson and loved the Mistborn trilogy and Warbreaker. Unfortunately, The Way of Kings is not for me. I'm going to keep the hardcover in my bookshelf for my five year old son. By the time he's ready to read it hopefully the whole series will be out.
0312600844|1.0|I thought his first book was fantastic, marvelous, stunning.  I could hardly wait to read his second one so splurged for the hard cover.  I can't finish it, I am sooooo bored. Reading it is like eavesdropping on the very dull next door neighbors.  It is slow, repetitious, and I can't find even an interesting sentence.  I am very disappointed and can hardly believe the hype about it.
B003IY48PS|5.0|The video and audio quality are about as good as it's probably gonna get for this horror classic. They also let you have the option of watching it in it's originally shot 4x3 mode. It also looks like you get almost every DVD extra released throughout the years. You can't go wrong with this release.
0439023521|5.0|I loved Katniss from the start and wanted her to win--at everything.  Great mixture of action, romance, danger and tenderness.
B001EOOQF6|5.0|I'm a huge Ozzy fan (as my screen name indicates) and love Ozzy Sabbath.  Greatest band ever, imo.  That said, Mob Rules flat out kicks a**!  This has the classic, plodding Sabbath sound that is so near and dear to my heart with the greatness of Ronnie James Dio at the helm, the only singer who could have possibly followed Ozzy and not missed a beat.  I got this CD in the \\"Rules of Hell\\" box set and, as much as I enjoy all of the CD's in the set (all of the Dio era Sabbath), this one is hands down the best.  The album starts out with Turn Up the Night and Voodoo, two classic rockers that get the album kicked off to a great start.  The third song, though, Sign of the Southern Cross, is one of the greatest Sabbath songs ever made.  Wow!  It starts out slowly and pleasantly enough, then explodes into one of the toughest songs you will ever have the pleasure to hear.  It's one of those songs that will stick in your head for days.  Every song on this album is fantastic and heavy, from the title track, to Country Girl, all the way to the great closer, Over and Over.  In between is another standout in the song Falling Off the Edge of the World.  Great song...Great album.  As I said, I love Ozzy Sabbath, but Mob Rules stands up right next to the best of them.  I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Put this DVD in your player and enjoy. Don't overlook the bonus track,  Woke Up Dreaming. If don't love this DVD,you must have checked your musical  ears at the door.
B002TYZKIM|2.0|I know this film was very popular and I'm sure that many MJ die-hards loved it but, what about the rest of us?    I'm not a huge MJ fan but, I dont necessarily believe that fandom is required in order to enjoy a concert movie like this. Sadly, this is one that I simply didn't enjoy despite enjoying much of MJ's music.     The film seemed to drag at times and at many points I felt like watching it was more like a chore. And to be perfectly honest, I'm a little upset that I didn't enjoy it. It's a film I really wanted to like.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Why did he have so many EP songs on this album? Three of those songs I have heard before and own. I wish he would have taken the Drake approach and released the EP and then dropped an album of new songs, no repeats. Other than that the album was awesome and I would recommend!
030726999X|5.0|This last of the series of 3 is exciting and very cleverly written. I am actually slowing down with my reading since I know this is the last one. I really don't want the story to end! I recommend all three books!!!

0890090572|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Old Holmes will not need a review to tell them that they ought to read Holmes in its entirety but would rather hear about the quality of the volume.  This one is top notch.  The original illustrations help the reader to read Holmes as the original readers did--with these marvelous illustrations and typeface.  This has all been carefully preserved by the publisher to give it a kind of retro panache so rarely found in modern typesetting.  Solid hard backing and glossy dust jacket round out this definitive volume both in form and substance.  If you have any old ratty, tattered, sun-faded copies of Holmes laying around--pitch 'em and get this one.
B000068OCS|1.0|MGM lost a class action suit in 2005 for 500 DVD titles which were cropped into widescreen from the old 4:3 fullframe image. This is one of those DVDs. I'm sorry I bought it and will buy a replacement as soon as the original version is released.
B00005MM01|1.0|This was advertised as a double album. The case states it is a double album. IT IS NOT. There was only a single CD Disc 1. The 'liner notes' are abysmal. It is virtually impossible to read them even with a magnifying glass. A REALLY CHEAP, SHODDY, AND DECEPTIVELY ADVERTISED PRODUCT.
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards may be the most grounded Satriani cd yet. All the songs are mid tempo to slow and Satch never really cranks things up. The good thing is that all of the songs have some redeeming qualities, which makes for an enjoyable listen. Just not one you'll find yourself bustin' out the air guitar to.<br /><br />The addition of keyboardist Mike Keneally was a good one, as he adds a nice touch to several tracks and helps make the material feel fresh. While it's hard to really pick the standout tracks on the disc, there are some I personally find appealing. They are \\"Premonition\\", \\"Dream Song\\", \\"Pyrrihic Victoria\\", and \\"Littleworth Lane\\", which ranks as one of the better ballads Joe has done.<br /><br />This is the most consistent Satch disc since the stellar \\"Crystal Planet\\", however the lack of true rockers is  a bit of a downer. 4/5 stars.
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|It's been decades since I bought a Clapton album.   But this one intrigued me, for whatever reason.  Eric Clapton became famous for his guitar playing.  But those days are long gone.  There's very little guitar playing - certainly nothing that will impress anyone.  The vocals are good.  Most of the songs are good.  While listening to it, I definitely hear Delaney and Bonnie's influence.   This is a good CD.  But for anyone who wants to hear Eric solo like he used to many years ago, I think those days are gone forever.  It seems to me that Eric is happy following others.  He just wants to go unnoticed, as far as guitar playing is concerned. He led the way while in Cream, but he left Cream and Blind Faith to be a sideman in D&B.  It's like he quit trying to be a great player and just became content with doing what others do - and not very well.  Personally, I wish EC would shut himself up in his room for 2-3 months and listen to his Cream records.  Then get an LP or 335, and an amp that doesn't sound like mud, and just PLAY.
0312600844|5.0|This is an amazing and beautiful book that I highly recommend to all readers who appreciate contemporary literature. Franzen and his characters may be obsessed with sex to the max but it's their vulnerability, sadness and flaws that make them very real and deeply human. I won't include any spoilers but I will say that the end of this book, specifically the last paragraph, left me nearly speechless and in tears, I was seriously that moved by it. Although there are a few sections I could have dealt entirely without, I believe this is the newest Great American Novel and I look forward to reading all the other Franzen books, since this is the first of his I have read.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|When I first started watching I didn't find this show to be that good and was surprised how well it was rated. After watching a few episodes I found myself laughing more and more.

B002VPE1XE|5.0|This camera case does the job very nicely. It is just the right size, well padded, and made of strong materials. It is useful for most digital point and shoot cameras as well as other items such as personal organizers, cellphones, and even wallets. The belt loop is secured by a large piece of Velcro which should be sufficiently strong. The front flap is large and also secured by Velcro. If you are looking for a good case, you may want this one.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|To read about the plot, read other reviews.  I just want to make a few comments about this movie.<br /><br />This movie came out in 1992.  I like this movie.  It's visually stunning with great special effects, sets, and costumes.  However, the movie doesn't follow Bram Stoker's novel 100 % faithfully, even though it's called Bram Stoker's Dracula.  I know a lot of people dislike this, but is this a bad thing?  Not necessarily.  I certainly don't mind when it comes to this movie and also Dracula (1979).  I'm more fussy when OTHER movies out there don't follow the novel they're based on faithfully, or they massacre the story completely, such as what was done with the \\"remake\\" of The Haunting (1999).  Now that, I have a problem with.<br /><br />How is the acting in this movie?  It's very good, for the most part.  I like Winona Ryder in her role as Mina Harker.  She did a good job.  Gary Oldman as Dracula was pretty good.  I don't care for his long hair and sunglasses later in the movie, but I like when he's an old guy in the beginning of the movie.  Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker was OK, while Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was good.  Dracula's brides were good as well.<br /><br />When I compare the Draculas from this movie and the 1979 movie, my favorite is Frank Langella from the 1979 movie.<br /><br />The gothic atmosphere, darkness, and overall feel is hard to beat.  The movie definitely has a Transylvania feel to it and is visually stunning.  The night scenes are especially good.  Excellent use of lighting, darkness, shadows, and everything macabre.<br /><br />The musical score by Wojciech Kilar is good.<br /><br />I think the second half of the movie isn't as good as the first half.  I also think that Dracula got pretty wimpy late in the movie.  To me, he showed tremendous weakness when it came to his relationship with Mina.  Dracula shouldn't be so lovesick.  Frank Langella in the 1979 movie was a romantic guy, but he never became lovesick.  He maintained his sinister and evil ways while being romantic.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie that should hold your attention.  4 1/4 stars.d movie that should hold your attention.  4 1/4 stars.

B003YHSE7W|5.0|I have very little to say concerning the BD, other than Paramount is trying to force combo packs upon local customers in Australia and thus are diverting money toward Amazon. But I would like to say one thing to the morons who are saying the first film was better. People like you are the reason why garbage like Daredevil et al get budget approvals. Psychological complexity and credible feuds trump \\"whee I'm flying!\\" sequences that are far too short and have no real payoff every time. Thank you.
B00006HBUA|2.0|This movie was disappointing. The thing that is interesting about the Scooby-Doo mysteries, is that there are no such things as ghosts and monsters - there is always some person \\"behind the mask\\". This movie completely turns that upside-down. In this movie, there is a cult of creepy monsters that exist and suck-out people's souls. This act seemed almost violent for kids to watch. I was horrified that they would take the basic premises of the series and turn it supernatural. My 7 year old was terrified - I wish I had previewed it.    I will say that it is worth watching just for the performance of the Shaggy and Velma characters - wow! They seemed like the cartoons brought to life.    I recommend Scooby-Doo 2 where there is a classic mystery with a real person behind it and the movie is still full of CGI creepy stuff for older kids.There is also a nice message of being happy with yourself and not trying to be someone that your not.

Mr. Carius, still alive at the time of this review, was drafted in 1940 and fought through the rest of the war in the Panzer 38(t), Tiger, and Jagdtiger armored fighting vehicles (the first two were tanks, while the last was an armored tank destroyer).<br /><br />The author covers the first three years of his war in just 25 pages, covering the time from his induction into the German army through his time in the Panzer 38(t) in Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.  I wish he would have spent more time covering this time frame, from his training, to more detail on the tank itself, and about the battles he fought in.  While he was drafted as an enlisted man and failed the Officer Training School he was sent to, perhaps being too much of a free thinker, he eventually received a battlefield commission and rose to the rank of Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant).<br /><br />The meat of the book begins in early 1943, when Mr Carius converts into a Tiger tank and is sent to Army Group north on the Leningrad front.  From then until July 1944, when he is severely wounded while reconnoitering without his tank, he gives wonderfully detailed descriptions about fighting in a Tiger, relationships with superiors and subordinates, and many of the battles he fought in, primarily as a tank platoon commander.<br /><br />After recovering from his wounds, he was posted to command a Jagdtiger company in early 1945, fought briefly in the battle for the Ruhr, and surrendered to the Americans in April 1945.  Unfortunately, he does not give many details about the Jagdtiger itself, which was a very rare and extremely powerful tank-destroyer (although not without serious flaws and limitations).  He ends his narrative describing his time in captivity (he did not think that Americans treated the captured soldiers well), and his views and thoughts after the war.<br /><br />The book includes many appendixes, including some interesting after action reports, and many, many pages of photocopies of the author's awards and decorations (along with an English translation of the same).  While I initially thought that these latter pages were overkill, as they include pretty much every decoration Mr Carius received, I've thought about it changed my mind.  These pages both lets those who are interested in German awards see what the different type of certificates looked like, and also show what a truly decorated veteran Mr. Carius is.  (When it was awarded, he was the youngest person to ever receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, and he had an \\"interesting\\" conversation with Heinrich Himmler when receiving the award.)<br /><br />Although I liked the book a lot, as noted above, I would have liked more detail about the earlier and latter parts of his service.  I also thought the book a bit disjointed at times, although I don't know if that is the author's or translator/editor's fault.  Overall, I give the book 4 stars, and recommend it to anyone with an interest in combat in a Tiger Tank on the eastern front.ixes, including some interesting after action reports, and many, many pages of photocopies of the author's awards and decorations (along with an English translation of the same).

0525951652|1.0|I debated for a long time before I got my Kindle.   My husband knew that I really wanted one, just because I was promised that the books would be $9.99.  So he got me one for Christmas and then I watched as the prices started to go up, most at $12.99.   I didn't want to spend that much for an e book, but when I saw the new Ken Follett book at $19.99 (and more than the hard copy) I decided that it would be the end of most of my Kindle purchases.   I can go back to the library or Sam's Club for my books.

B003UPPO2G|4.0|I had the DTS version and sold it before I could compare it to the Anniversary version.   Now is it my imagination or is the Anniversary version remixed?   When I play the Anniversary version on my surround sound in either Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1  the vocals doesn't sound up front in the mix and I hear percussions from the center front speaker  which I find too loud and distracting. Shouldn't the vocals be from the center front speaker (and the front sides)?  Was it always like this? I don't seem to remember it being like this.   The extra songs and interviews are in stereo only, no 5.1 Dolby or DTS.

160094048X|5.0|I just got this book last week for and have already made several cookies from the book. I love how there is all kinds of cookies, not just the same old ones like Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal, and so on. My favorite cookie so far has to be Minonos on page 150. They are like Milano's but are so much better. This book is just all around great and so far everything that I have baked has come out tasting perfect. I have other Vegan Cookbooks and the cookies in the other books are just too sweet but these recipes have the right amount. You can tell that the authors put alot of time and effort in all aspects with this book.
0156030306|5.0|Flowers for Algernon                                                   by Daniel Keyes              Flowers for Algernon is an emotional story about a mentally retarded man named Charlie Gordon. He is 33 years old and works at Donner's Bakery. Charlie is teased and made fun of by his co-workers Joe Carp, Frank Reilly, and Gimpy. Charlie believes they are his friends because they always laugh at him, but they definitely aren't friends with Charlie.               At the beginning of the story, Charlie had an unusual low IQ of 68. He has bad mechanics, several spelling errors, and expresses his ideas indistinctly. Charlie was chosen as the subject for an experimental medical procedure at the Beekman College for Retarded Adults. This procedure is expected to increase his intelligence dramatically. The procedure was originally performed on a lab mouse named Algernon. Algernon runs through intricate and complicated mazes. In the beginning, he races Charlie and beats him to the end every time. This story is told through journal entries that are written by Charlie. He maintains these journal entries because the doctors that are in command of the procedure want to analyze how his intelligence has expanded before and after the procedure. Although Charlie has a terribly low IQ, he is very hard-working and motivated to become more intelligent and educated.              After the surgery was performed on Charlie, he learned the procedure turned out to be a fleeting achievement because he absorbed more and more knowledge very rapidly. His punctuation, spelling, and pronunciation of words improve severely. Just weeks after the experimental surgery, his IQ shoots up to 185. Charlie's intelligence soon flies past Algernon's intelligence and he beats Algernon at the mazes. Charlie begins to bond with Algernon during his progression.               As Charlie progresses, his interests in loving relationships also progresses. During the story, Charlie falls in love with his teacher, Miss Kinnian. He is very attracted to her and grows very close to her throughout the story. Charlie also has a physical relationship with his neighbor, Fay. As his intelligence grows, so does the pain of past memories. Charlie has painful flashbacks of his family and friends. When he was mentally retarded, he didn't realize that his mother always cried because she felt so ashamed of Charlie. He also wasn't aware of the fact that his \\"friends\\" always made fun of him. Now that Charlie realizes what was happening, he emotionally fell apart.              Suddenly, Algernon's intelligence deteriorates quickly. He soon dies because of this sudden deterioration. Charlie is concerned about how this happened. Charlie succeeds in finding Professor Nemur's error in his hypothesis. Charlie scientifically proved that one flaw in the operation would cause him to lose his intelligence just as fast as he gained it. He calls this the Algernon-Gordon Effect. Soon Charlie's intelligence deteriorates as well. At the end of the story, he becomes mentally retarded again. Charlie still wants his relationship with Alice to continue, but sends her away because he feels his old self coming back. Charlie decided to move because he didn't want the people he knew to feel sorry for him. Charlie moved to a home for disabled adults. His last petition was to put flowers on Algernon's grave.              The lesson learned in this story is to accept yourself for who you are no matter what others say about you. Being true to you is more important than what others have to say. The genre of this book is science fiction . I gave this book a 5.0 out of 5.0 stars because it was a great book. It is the best book I've read all year. Although this story had a sad ending, the book kept me wanting to read more.
B001992NW4|5.0|This new Blu-ray of The Exorcist is perfect. It looks amazing. You will be blown away. You get both the original theatrical version and \\"the version you've never seen\\". The extras are awesome. The new documentary included includes a ton of never before seen behind the scenes footage. You also get the \\"Fear Of God\\" BBC documentary. Every theatrical and television trailer. Several different commentaries. Also a sound fx test track for the demon voices of Regan. Story boards, deleted scenes and more. This new hi def transfer shows off every detail of Dick Smith's brilliant make-ups. The opening scenes in Iraq have so much depth and scope. I can't say enough. I wish more films were given the treatment that this blu-ray has received.

B003Y8YXEO|4.0|With the anniversary of what would have been John's 70th B-day. Yoko has decided to release John's albums again. I bought this cd to see if there was any improvement in the sound. Well after listening to it, To me there is no difference. You're best bet is to buy the Working Class Hero Collection. You get 2cd's that have 20 songs on each disc. The sound is the same as these new discs. It's too bad Yoko keeps doing this to John. Is she going to remaster these same recordings again in 10 years, for John's 80th B-day? ENOUGH IS ENOUGH Yoko, how much more money do you need.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|This is the moment.  If we boycott this outrageously priced book, its price will come down and publishers will learn a lesson.  Buy at 20 and we will be doomed to higher prices forever.  Be strong.
006136472X|5.0|I find that Ken Follett does a magnificent job of weaving his multiple characters into a great adventure.
0451208706|3.0|Prior to reading The Man From St. Petersburg, I read with great enjoyment other Follett novels--The Key to Rebecca, Eye of the Needle, and Pillars.  But this one, while interesting historically, I found to be at times tedious and uninteresting.  It's too bad, because the characters are complex and the story, events that led up to the first World War, is intriguing.  But somehow, it missed conveying the excitement and thrills that one usually finds in Follett's novels.  Some of the behavior of the main characters is really far-fetched, and sometimes the details in the story-telling became boring to read.  Overall, it's not a bad book, but it just isn't up to the author's usual gripping style.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|After the abrupt left turn Joe Satriani took with the Chickenfoot project (not that I didn't like it, but...), he turns around and hands us his latest which harks back to much of his earlier works and, yet, remains fresh.  In fact, I would have to say this has quickly become my favorite Satriani album start to finish.  He is in the zone on every track and his bandmates are right there with him every step of the way.  Truly a remarkable work.  If anybody tries to tell you instrumental rock has sounded it's death knell, get a copy of this CD for them.  Truly an affirmation of everything that's right with contemporary rock!    Hey, Joe - loved the short acoustic (?) break which is \\"Solitude.\\"  How about an entire album in this vein?
0525951652|5.0|Let me save you the trouble of plowing through the less than 5 star reviews here.  The reviewers idiotically reviewed their KINDLE book and its pricing, and NOT THE BOOK itself!  This book is TERRIFIC!  The story is facinating and the characters are so life-like, you're taken back to 1914 in an instant!  Get the book folks!  Don't wait for the paperback.  It's a great read that you won't be disappointed in! Ken Follett is a master storyteller!
B00003CXUM|4.0|In the Mood for Love is exquisitely photographed, and there's fine acting from all. Best is the wonderful screenplay, depicting a sadness and frustration that can only be interpreted by the viewer. It's not a million laffs, but a character study worthy of consideration. Tony Leung is fine; Maggie Cheung is terrific, handling all this upset with dignity and grace.This took place in '62, so maybe traditions were different then; the claustrophobic setting added angst. Wonderful supporting characters. I rented the film because of all those awards it received; maybe I expected more. Don't watch if their are distractions (kids, phones, etc.)
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I freaking LOVE Glee. The cast is so diverse, each episode they focus on a different theme while still tagging along the major plots of each characters. It's relationships like sues and her sister that really tug on your heart strings and make this series one of the best on TV. Not to mention they do great musical numbers. Even if you don't like musicals give Glee a chance, it's a great drama as well.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|AT $9.49, this is a smoking deal!! You can only appreciate this movie with blueray crystal clear graphic and sounds. A must buy at this price! Get it now before the deal is gone!
B000QUCPWU|5.0|Ok, first of all Booker T and the MGs  is a really great instrumental group that has been around awhile.  Their music is absolutely great, and if your old enough, you can remember the original songs in their entire length, noting, what you hear is what you get use to. Therefore, when a song is altered, cut, or just modified, you don't like it, SO, Original songs remastered, such as on this album, is the BEST.  If your from the old west....
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is a fast paced, edge of your seat series that will have about any aged audience wanting more. It will keep you biting your nails and turning the pages, while hoping for the best, fearing the worst, and trying to keep your mind wrapped around all the twist and turns along with the main character, Katness. First let me inform parents, this is probably not the best series for your younger children, due to violence. People will die in these books, and some rather violently. As a parent, it is your responsibility to use discretion if this is appropriate or not for your children.    The style of writing the author uses takes a minute to get used to, it is first person present tense. I was turned off by how strange this style felt at first, but as you read on it is plain to see how this style intensifies your reading experience. I am a guy, and reading from a young girls prospective was not a problem in these books.    The box set is really just the 3 books in normal hardback size, with a cardboard box that displays the covers of the 3 books. It is not anything too fancy, but it is a nice protector for the books.    I highly recommend the books for about anyone. I waited for my younger sibling to be 12 before I pushed him to read them (he hates to read) and he consumed the books within a couple of weeks. He is mature for his age and violence doesn't effect him too strongly (though I shield him from violent movies/games/books), but if you are concerned these books might be too violent or upsetting I will list a few things that happen in the first book without spoiling too much.    *Spoilers* The book is based on a young girl that ends up in a fight to the death with 23 other teenagers set up by a corrupt government. She befriends some of the contestants, and mostly everyone she befriends dies. This can upset some readers. Deaths comes in violent ranges between not seeing the death, but knowing it happened, to up close descriptions of \\"kids\\" being stabbed, poisoned, blown-up, etc. There are frightening situations that leave the main and side characters fighting for their lives/running from strange creatures/hiding from people and things that want to kill them. Book 3 can be more upsetting than the others due to the amount of unhappy things that happen. Bad language is minimum, however there are a few uses of milder swearing/exclamations. No use of \\"really bad\\" words.    With that caution mentioned, these books are fantastic. I have read Twilight, Harry Potter, etc. and so far this is my favorite series. This is an original story with dynamic characters and a plot that will keep you guessing. Read them. You will love these books.    Hope this helps. I give this box set 5 stars.    God Bless!
B0000263YY|5.0|[[ASIN:B00000AG8R Xanadu]]  To start, I have to say that Olivia Newton John knocks my socks off every time. That being said, I had read a review that panned the movie and the music badly saying in essence that it was a \\"wimpy\\" version of a previous offering. The choreography and special effects, while a bit overdone at times, are a marvel. Olivia never failed to deliver a blockbuster performance.  It is a love story on the surface while a wonderful example of people who have dreams and the guts to see them through. I will agree that Gene Kelly could have been a bit more believable, but being the central character in making his dream happen, I can overlook this. Thanks for the chance to spout off.

B00402FGEE|5.0|Love the show!! Watched it several times already. I had been waiting for the whole season and glad that it's finally here.
0553805371|5.0|I hold a Ph.D. in Biology and always interested in the origin of universe/living being. This is the best book I've read regarding the origin of universe. The book references the latest discoveries in cosmology and describes the subject in a way very easy understood for ordinary people. Enjoyed reading the book and I have bought two other Stephen Hawking's books after read The Grand Design.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Amazon, you have got some nerve!  I bought the book for my Kindle because I really, really wanted to read it and didn't have time to go to the bookstore or library, plus, I didn't want to have to lug a 1000 page book to/from work.  That's the real reason, the size of this book.  I am not buying a Kindle book for more that $9.99.  That was the price that was more or less promised when I purchased my Kindle, now, you've gone and screwed everyone who bought a Kindle.  It's not right.  If the publishers raise the price, you should tell them you cannot sell it for that price, people won't buy it, then, they will be forced to lower the price.  Come on, give us all a break.  We spent a lot of money for the Kindle and now we are expected to spend even more.  I'm on my way to the library for the best sellers that are over $9.99.  Amazon, the publishers and authors have lots more money than I will ever have!  I'm really enjoying the book but the price has put me in a bad mood.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|The Beatles' Ed Sullivan performances showcase them at their best - and at this juncture, the Beatles were (and still are) the best live Rock and Roll band ever to exist. None better. To this date, no band or performer in any idiom has topped the impact these performances had on music, popular culture and social change. These televised gigs display songs, singing, ensemble performances and charisma beyond anything else in music, prior to or since. These shows were like an alien invasion. They ended the '50's, kicked off the '60's, helped a grieving nation heal from the horrific Kennedy killing, and launched revolutions in thought, social change, sexuality and music that shaped the cultural curve of the most important century since the dawn of civilization.  All that accomplished with just  4 voices, 2 guitars, a bass, three amps, a drum set, killer chops, and perhaps most importantly, amazing songs.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I understand that the publisher sets the price, but I think Amazon could do a better job negotiating the price.  I have noticed that the prices of E books have risen in the past year.  I have also come to a decision to go back to regular books until e books come back to normal.  Previously published paperbacks are now many times 9.99 and I could order it used for 0.50.  Convenience is one thing - getting screwed over after having purchased the kindle just sucks.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|I purchased the blu-ray version and the disc + on demand (online rental) version was ready for me to watch right away (free special offer at the time).  In the online version, the subtitles seemed fine, no complaints from me(however, as of this time, I do not know if the blu-ray subtitles are the same or not as the online version).  The movie itself was great, would highly recommend it to my friends and family. This was also the first time I used the on demand/online rental service. I don't have the best internet speed but this movie worked fine, no hiccups.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I learned about the outrageous pricing of this ebook through the New York Times and I think it is a shame! If it does not stop now all the publishers will milk us all dry. Mind you an ebook involves no paper, transport, postage etc.    And as for the so called counter protest reviews a lot of them sound awfully similar (I wonder). I don't blame Amazon I blame greed. Be strong and don't buy until the price goes down.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I had to buy this book at Barnes and Noble as my Kindle is broken, and I can't get it repaired! I miss it as this book is heavy and would have been better on my Kindle. It cost $25 in the store so why all the complaints about the Kindle price.  I really enjoyed this book and can't wait until there's a sequel..

B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is a movie and music that I've NEVER grown tired of.  Whether you're Scottish or not, or Scottish descent as I am  and half of the United States is, you're gonna love this,that  is IF you liked the movie, and you like bagpipes!  I've come to fall in love with William Wallace, and what  he did in Scotland. One line in the movie says,   \\"Men(people)don't follow titles, they follow courage...\\"  Isn't it true??  Do we see much courage now-a-days? If we would stop being  \\"lovers of ourselves\\" and start doing the UN-popular,  taking a stand, and care about others as much as we do  ourselves. Wouldn't this planet be a different place?  I know there are many who are courageous in what they  do everyday. I know there are REAL live battles to be won  in our lives, and in our hearts, in the \\"intangible\\".  I see that in fellow Americans. and there are many that I   admire here in the USA. I'd like to see MORE and positive   change for the so called \\"small people\\" in our country.  I love this music. and I hope it will inspire everyone  who listens to it to remember what William Wallace stood  for, and let us get a vision, like Scotland did, for our  own country!
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|In his autumn years, Clapton is openly examining his life and creating the music he loves. Life, death, jealousy, love and blues are all themes seamlessly woven through the CD.  He is finally sober, content in his life and making the music he wants to make with no need to prove anything to anyone. Those that are expecting an ever escalating demonstration of his guitar prowess will be disappointed because for quite some time now, he has refused to be one dimensional. There is plenty of virtuosity on this CD but to want nothing but speed diminishes the value of this music.<br /><br />This CD isn't disappointing; it is a gift from a mature artist creating music that is pitch perfect for where he is now in his life. The naysayers might be happier with aging rockers like the Stones still pretending they're twenty instead of sixty. Not to imply he's a slouch, Clapton, on Run Back to Your Side, dreams up one of the most infectious guitar riffs since Sunshine of Your Love.<br /><br />The blues are relatively ageless, but some of these songs would sound  ridiculous performed by a young man -- like Rocking Chair. Undoubtedly this didn't escape Clapton when he selected these tunes. This is the time in his life to perform this music, and he has made these songs his own and done it with both grace and mastery. From beginning to end the CD is simply fabulous and I am happy to see where his next CD takes us.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|I was finally able to watch this movie in English, it was even better than before. The Blu-Ray edition has excellent audio, and clarity; a must for any Evangelion fan. Storyline takes along the same lines as the original series, although the extra visuals makes watching this new editon worthwhile. Keep in mind that it is only the beginning of a line of new movies, so even if it doesn't completely feel like a masterpiece; it's still a stunning opening to a fantastic follow-up.
0586045449|4.0|I read this book when it was first published in 1970 or '71; I think I bought it while still in college. I have read it several times since then - five or six times for sure; perhaps more - and still believe it to be one of the best written descriptions of World War Two aviation available. The technical detail and minutia is stunning in both its inherent complexity and the manner in which the author devolves it into easily understood terms. I include in this the presentations of what it was like to fly in these aircraft. In this aspect, I have to take exception with the reviewer who felt the comment about how different flying in a jet is from a Lancaster was unnecessary editorial. Having flown in three World War Two era bombers (B-17, B-24 and B-25), I can state it is very different from what most of us consider flying. Modern aircraft `punch' through the air, effectively overcoming it by brute force. The aircraft of WW2 tended to `bob' in it, moving around like flotsam on the sea. In fact, a pilot of a Tiger Moth described it that way to me during a flight. Add to that shaking motion, air streaming in through a variety of planned/needed openings and having to maneuver through narrow spaces and around objects while wearing heavy clothing and you start to get the idea that it wasn't the clich&eacute;d \\"piece of cake.\\"<br /><br />And that was level flight without anyone shooting at you. Try to imagine being in one of these aircraft when it was in distress - burning, spinning out of control with centrifugal force preventing you from even getting to the narrow exit hatch. There were a  lot of reasons so many bomber crew died.<br /><br />The basic story is a narrative from multiple points-of-view of a period of time before during and after a British bombing raid on a town in Germany. We are introduced to characters involved directly and peripherally with the Endeavour. We learn about the mission; how it is to be carried out and the preparations required to execute it and to counter it.  The key twist in the story - be aware there are numerous smaller ones related to individual characters - is the bombing raid is misdirected. A `fortunes of war' occurrence leads to hundreds of aircraft dropping their bombs not on a large city, but on a small town miles and miles away. Think of a planned bombing raid on New York City instead being carried out on White Plains or an attack on London destroying Hemel Hempstead. As one might expect, the mission is not without casualties on both sides.

The key twist in the story - be aware there are numerous smaller ones related to individual characters - is the bombing raid is misdirected. A `fortunes of war' occurrence leads to hundreds of aircraft dropping their bombs not on a large city, but on a small town miles and miles away. Think of a planned bombing raid on New York City instead being carried out on White Plains or an attack on London destroying Hemel Hempstead.

0439023521|4.0|I first heard of the Hunger Games on website that I am member of. It's one of those websites that let people swap books with each other. I didn't give the book too much thought except for the fact that a lot of people wanted it. As coincidence would have it I was at my local library looking through the take a book leave a book section and Hunger Games jumped off the shelves at me. At first, I was thinking that I would just trade it right away for something that I wanted to read. However, that night I got bored and started reading.<br /><br />The book is told from the perspective of Katniss, a scrappy and spunky sixteen-year old girl, from the poorest of the Districts. The story is set into motion when Katniss takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The story behind the Hunger Games is that every year two names (a boy and a girl) are drawn at random from each of the 12 districts in a mythical country called Panem-The back of the book says that Panem was once North America, but the reader never gets that feeling because the author has neglected to add in any details. It could be a version of America in the future or it could be a different place on a different planet- to participate in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a punishment by the government imposed on the districts because of a rebellion that had happened many years before.<br /><br />The point of the Hunger Games is to be the last one standing. Some people may find it disturbing that only kids 12-18 are in the games which means that the games involve children killing children. It's almost the same theme as in Battle Royale. However, Battle Royale was a little more violent and more political. Not to fear though even as violent as the backdrop is there is very little violence and when there is Suzanne Collins, the author, has seen fit not to describe it.<br /><br />It's a quick read; two sittings and I was done. That's not a bad thing at all. It's just that the Hunger Games is not what I would call a \\"deep\\" novel. Yes, the characters are pretty well developed and so is the story. However, most of the \\"young adult\\" novels that have come out in the past decade (Harry Potter, Twilight) are short on description and use short bare bone sentences. For example, if Panem was once North America it would have been nice to have seen something that was associated with America; a busted up part of an interstate or buildings that had fallen into ruin or even myths mentioned in passing would have been nice. But because the writing is geared towards young adults you don't get a lot of details. Your average adult reader (even a lot of younger readers) can fly through the book.  You won't get any intellectual stimulation reading Hunger Games, but if that's what you want I recommend you read Camus.<br /><br />The only real complaint that I have with the Hunger Games is that Collins switches tenses in the middle of pages. It throws the narrative off jumping from past and present tenses mid sentence, but you can get over that pretty quickly. It doesn't happen too often (though some people would say once was too many) and considering the genre it is not enough to slam the entire book.<br /><br /> It's not every day that you pick up a book, almost on whim, and find that you have found a little treasure. I was entertained and finding myself rooting for Katniss, even though you know she is going to make it to the end of the book. At times it was hokey, like when it was announced that there could be two winners and not one because Collins was trying to develop the love interests in the book, and silly. All and all Hunger Games is a good book.<br /><br /> I am not in a rush to go out and find the other books in the series, but if I came across them I would have no problem continuing the adventures started in the Hunger Games.vel.

B003ZJJFKE|5.0|This is Joe Satriani's first \\"studio\\" album of Barack Obama's Presidency and it is really good. He's got a show tomorrow night at the Uptown Theater in Napa, California and he will make two great shows, Waiting for a Girl Like You and Joe Satriani at the Uptown Theater make Napa a \\"better place\\". It is best of new music in 2010 because I haven't been getting into new music this year except The Eagles, and Herbie Hancock and new music has been creating a little bit of a slowdown to me this year because the old FYE in Napa (the old Wherehouse) closed and The Black Crowes Music Episode in May of 2010. I want my girl named Allison \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" to listen to this tomorrow and I'm going to the show tomorrow night with her. Let me say this. Two great concerts in Napa!
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|For too many years to recall, Double Fantasy was a difficult listen, very problematic to separate the murder of John Lennon from the joyfulness of the music that John displays here in his half of the album. When I went back to the album years later with the release of Milk and Honey, I excluded the Yoko material. Yesterday, I played the entire record and I must say I'm quite surprised at how good Yoko's material is, the vocals are not up to professional standards, but the music is really quite vital and exciting in no small measure due to John's intuitive abilities. The new mix is the real deal for me, I never liked the Gospel singing girls on \\"Starting Over\\", they are completely wiped off the \\"Stripped Down\\" version to astonishing effect. The new mix features a crispness to the songs, with John's voice no longer being double tracked and background singers being wiped clean. JL's voice is also brought far up into the mix as is the drums. The guitars sparkle with clarity, and in fact all of the songs have a spaciousness and clarity not heard before with these tracks, also most importantly the whole affair has been flattened out, it doesn't sound like John's singing between two mountains, the echo of the vocals has vanished and that brings a lot of warmth to the proceedings. I'd give this album as a whole, 4 stars, but the Lennon songs are worth five, this collection represents some of his best solo material. The song \\"Woman\\" actually sounds like an alternate take to me, the others sound like the originals, some of the songs continue to run past the original length and offer some interesting differences. All in all this is a terrific buy as you get the Original CD and the new mix for the price of one, so really only a Blue Meanie would criticize something that's essentially given away with the original. Highly recommended.

0066620996|4.0|Along with Built to Last, Jim Collins' bestselling Good to Great is probably on the bookshelves of many business leaders. The idea for the book came from Bill Meehan, who pointed out that the great companies described in Built to Last had always been great. He was looking for research on how to take the average business - a good business - and propel it to greatness.<br /><br />Jim Collins and his team accepted the challenge and launched a five-year research program to answer the question. They learned that regardless of which industry your business is in, even if it's a \\"terrible\\" industry right now, your business can skyrocket from good (or even \\"nothing\\") to great and sustain that greatness for fifteen years or more. Here are some broad themes associated with companies that surge ahead:<br /><br />1. Good-to-great leaders are almost always promoted from within. They are also more likely to be quietly, fiercely brilliant instead of dazzling the media with flashy showmanship. Their unwavering focus is on the business, not themselves, and they freely credit other team members for the company's success.<br /><br />2. Good-to-great leaders strategically put people before processes. They \\"first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats - and then they figured out where to drive it.\\" This strategy is more important than ever as the rate of change continues to accelerate and the most popular jobs of the future aren't even available today. The right people have the essential skills needed to quickly anticipate, learn, adapt, and push forward. And they love their work largely because they love their co-workers.<br /><br />3. Good-to-great companies have a culture of discipline and simplicity. Within that culture, they don't rely on major change initiatives or dramatic restructuring plans to achieve greatness; they just stick to their business plans and steadfastly push forward. (Note: They don't *blindly* push forward; they still \\"confront the brutal facts\\" from inside and outside the organization to make the best possible day-to-day decisions along the way.)<br /><br />4. Good-to-great companies accelerate growth by adopting carefully selected forms of technology that align with their business model. For example, in 1999 Walgreen's responded to the new threat of drugstore.com by carefully analyzing the situation, brainstorming alternatives, and then designing/launching Walgreens.com - a high-quality website that was consistent with its core business. Their stock price almost doubled within the year, while drugstore.com had to lay off staff as its initial value plummeted.<br /><br />I don't know if the book has any earth-shattering revelations, but I think it will inspire you with its great examples of business leaders who rejected mediocrity and relentlessly propelled their businesses from good to great. As Winston Churchill wrote, \\"Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty -- never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.\\"brutal facts\\" from inside and outside the organization to make the best possible day-to-day decisions along the way.)    4.

B002GSXKN8|4.0|The Boy Billionaire is back again, again, and again in these 4 awesome movies wrapped in one package on two disks. Does is it the special features? YES. The Cast & Character info? YES. Much More? Yes !! I think everyone ought to have at least some form of The Batman Collection going on. In no way am I disappointed in this product... Well except the DVD case they put it in. It's recycled and I would suggest transferring your DVDs to a more secure case. I give This Batman Collection ah 10++ , but the case a 4.
0143115014|4.0|This book is great, much better written than I had anticipated.  However, it didn't come in as good condition as I was led to expect from the seller.  It was stamped that it was an out of circulation library book, in a manner that could not be removed.  Also, it had large stickers accross the back and front covers, as well as the spine that were very difficult to remove, and left residue that could not be taken off.  Oterwise, a wonderful read, but I was wanting to give it as a gift, and couldn't in this condition.  Because I addressed this with the seller, they refunded my purchase & shipping charge, and they were wonderful to deal with.  They should divulge the condition of the book so you know what you're getting.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|I'm an old Ironman fan. So I know they have 30 years of story to draw from and MOST of the Marvel serise has better, faster, more intigeing storylines. I didn't see the movie in the theater so when I saw the Blu-Ray on sale for $13.I thought it was a great bargain.  Not so much.     The story really moves pretty slow, and the action scenes are few but pretty good.    The opening scene (2nd actaull scene) at the Stark Expo (think World Fair) is Tony Stark at his narsasitic high or low depending upon how you want to interpret it. But it is just one example of how they slow the movie down and make it drag along, it takes way too much time.  There were definetly NO Acadamy Awards given for editing or scripts in Iron Man 2.     The action starts about 35 to 40 minutes into the movie and its too late to resesetate the toxic script. At this point you finally get to see Ivan Vanko bring on the pain in the Monaco Grand Prix, slicing cars in half with his own Russian version of the ARC reactor and the PLASMA whips he uses to slice throug iorn. It is visually stunning for a few minutes but hardly worth the 30 to 45 minute wait.    They spend some time setting up the the stroy arc for S.H.I.E.L.D. and H.A.M.M.E.R as combatent government contractors and this means they have to write Nick Furry into the script, which seems kind of forced and clumsy.  The only elegant part of this is the introduction of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who steals the show in the final 20 minutes with the best action scene of the movie. (There is something hypnotizing about watching an attractive redhead rotating through Judiso space while kicking butt. Oh yeah, did I mention she is in skin tight black leather?)    The final 20 minutes of this Blu-Ray along with the extra features like the S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault and some of the tech details make it worth keeping.    Do I think Super Hero movies need to be \\"elegant\\"? Yes, the writers have very little excuse when they have 30 years of storyline andmaterial to draw on. The first Iron Man was far superior to Iron Man 2 and it was a bit clunky at times.    The best part of both of the Iron Man movies is Robert Downey Jr. He seems to be custom made or trained to be Tony Stark.  I just hope this flop doesn't scare him off and we end up with Zach Effron in his place for the Avenger movies.
B001P829VY|5.0|This is the blu ray review you fans have been waiting for...this is an outstanding transfer of this classic! I have the two disc DVD released and even upconverted to 1080p, there was alot missing. Don't believe people when they say that DVD upconverted looks just as good as blu ray-PHOOEY! You cannot add to the picture what is not already there!! DVD is limited by its storage space along with old compression schemes. Low resolution is still low resolution even 'upconverted'. Do yourself a favor and get a blu ray player and re-invest in blu ray discs and let Treasure of Sierra Madre be your first purchase. The detail is astonishing! The shadow detail is awesome. I was drawn into the movie like never before! Warner did a fantastic job with this and \\"Maltese Falcon\\" on blu ray. All the same special features from the two disc DVD are here on 'Treasure' but only on one disc! The only complaint I have is the lack of bookmarking your favorite scenes to quickly jump to them in the future (HD DVD spoiled me on that), but all in all this movie has never looked better...very little grain and most of debris cleaned up. Just keep releasing more classics like these and at decent prices. Most people might be turned off by the 'square' aspect ratio (seems we want to 'fill our tv screen with picture'), but that's ok...you can choose to stretch the image to fill the 16:9 screen (but it doesn't look right).<br />Anyway this is a great looking classic that can be cherished for years to come!!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|While I prefer tradional Arkansas Stones for my knives, this is a very good product for quickly sharpening machettes, hatchets/tomahawks, axes and trowel/e-tool/shovel points. Very compact and light-weight for backpacking and emergency/survival kits and does an excellent job sharpening. The only addition I would suggest is a groove in the diamond rod for sharpening fish hooks. I would recommend this to family and friends and I will likely purchase additional units for my various emergency/survival kits.
B003ZWDFWA|5.0|This region free import blu ray from UK is awesome!! Got cheaper from Amazon uk, instead of spending an arm and a leg here in the states (could not wait for US release) and boy am I impressed! The beautiful transfer of this movie is the best it has ever looked. Still strange watching this 1.85 widescreen...but I got used to the wide angle shots when used. I cannot get over the great shadow detail! The disc has an original 2.0 mono (spread to two channels) and new DTS HD 5.1 that is wide, but not deep. The disc is FULL of special features (too many to list here). This impressive transfer from Universal will probably be the one to be released here in the states, but spend a few extra bucks and get this steel case (they are cool! and collectable and sturdy). Which ever version you get, get this 50th anniversary edition of PSYCHO to add to your collection...you won't be disappointed!
0810970686|5.0|The concept of these books is so simple with endless possibilities; I wish I had created the idea myself. My Son has every book with the exception of the new edition due out in Nov which he pre-ordered. I have read sections of each and although I have not read cover to cover, I can attest that my Son loves them and so do I since it keeps him involved in reading.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|This review is now based on the book. I join the protest in the price of this book  I'll not buy it from Amazon, even if I have to pay more at the bookstore.  Actually the price is a little less.  What happened to the promised $9.99 for most books.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I love Pillars of the Earth and other Follet historical fiction and was looking forward to reading Fall of Giants on my Kindle.  This price is outrageous and I will not buy this book!      I don't understand this pricing strategy at all.  Amazon sells a high priced product (Kindle) with the promise that buyers will get low cost access to books.  The promise has been broken, this is bad for business.    The publisher gets several benefits from e-books (no cost to print, ship, etc) plus the biggest benefit, that being that you cannot share a Kindle e-book.  I'd be interested in knowing how many times on average a physical book is passed around and read by multiple people.  I'm sure on average is 2 or 3 times.  Keeping prices fair on e-books increases the number of copies sold, that alone justifies significantly lower pricing.
0596009208|5.0|I have bought many books that teaches Java and none of them work for me. They all are overloaded with not very helpful information.  I like the language of this book and the way they explain things. Sometimes, I wish they give more examples but overall it's a great book especially for people who have little to medium knowledge of Java.
0375703764|5.0|I have relinquished a life in order to understand this book. I feel I will go to Nirvana upon full realization.
0316017922|5.0|I like this book because it explores some of the hidden reasons behind success.  Usually books that deal with success only bring to light the factors that one can control.  I believe this book shares new insight as to how environment also plays a role in one's success.
0307454541|2.0|This book has laid, half-read and collecting dust, on my night stand for over two months. I've since read ten other books. How this poorly written rambling book ever got published is beyond me. What surprises me more is that's its been on the Best Seller list for months. While the author handles point of view issues fairly well, his detailed ramblings about government and economic corruption reads like heels in a quagmire of mud. I kept hoping I'd hit the good parts. I gave up waiting.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Ken Follet continues to trade on his name when he has long ago ceased to have anything interesting to say. Don't waste your time and money on this overpriced waste of paper.  Hell, at the ridiculous E-Book price, it's a waste of electrons too.  Get with he program publishers - E-Books are a whole new market where you could be making MORE money (yeah, a lower per unit profit - but greater volume) if you revised your pricing strategies.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|This movie is yet another reason why Batman is one of, if not the greatest superhero in the world. If you are a true Batman fan thin you most own this movie hands down. This movie could go to theaters as a live action film and make major waves in the entertainment industry. If you don't have it get it, and show your children the power of a real hero!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|This is a great movie that is visually stunning and captivating.  I bought the original release so that I could enjoy watching the movie in 2D while I waited for the 3D version to be released.  Now they are releasing a Collector's Edition of the movie which is fantastic but they should have included these movies in 3D as released in the theaters.  For that exclusion, this release gets one star
B003R0LBVW|5.0|When I saw the \\"%80\\" in the corner of my kindle I felt sad knowing that soon I'd have to say good-bye to the Berglund family and the other characters who populate this wonderful book. Ironic, funny, real, sexy and sad people portrayed in a masterful way create such a wonderful reading experience that I just can't think of anything to read next. Franzen deserves all the recognition he's received and I'm looking forward to his next novel.
0140157352|5.0|Getting to Yes has been around for many years and I always assumed it was some kind of slick how-to-sell-stuff book. It's not.  Instead, it breaks down the process of negotiation in a way that is both sensible and consistent with important social and personal values.  The book makes explicit the importance of preserving/improving relationships, while also making clear that principles matter.  The book highlights the false dichotomy of either stubbornly holding to a position or capitulating about something dearly held without a good, principled reason for doing so. The book makes accessible a process that seems particularly critical in a society growing more polarized, less civil, and increasingly interested in volume at the expense of reason and cooperation.  Nothing described in the book is magic but it is all immediately applicable to your next negotiation, big or small, and it is all stuff you can begin doing unilaterally.
B003JTHESA|2.0|True Maiden fans and ones who are not afraid to express their real opinions, will agree, that this album just falls flat. Production quality is very good, but songs are quite dull.  Bruce just doesn't have it anymore and arrangements are unimaginative.  But hey, they are still great live and I will buy every album they put out from here to eternity!
B0043IMW4W|5.0|Finally KWS is caught on tape ripping it up! This album is worth it for Voodoo Child alone. KWSB routinely closes their sets with this song and it's great to hear a pro recording of it. The KWSB standards are great and the songs with the guests were great picks! Highly recommended for any blues fan.
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|I love this show. It is intelligent, funny, and well thought out. But please, if you are a stickler for everything to look exactly like it would have looked back then (as if - we are talking about a time of magic, you know), then please stick to the history channel and don't look down on those of us who enjoy a little fantasy now and then.
6305127638|5.0|Of all the Star Trek movies, even the ones with the original Star Trek series cast, this one is absolutely the best. Superbly written with a great story. Frakes did an excellent job as well with directing. Special effects are pretty good for the always tight budget of Roddenberry flicks, (as expected with any Star Trek movie). Data is a center point of the plot and shows some pretty bad ass moves against the Borg at times. Oh, and Deanna Troi looks absolutely hot in this movie! Highly recommended watch again and again.

B003TEO3EI|2.0|May have to give another listen or two but first impression, not great.  Obviously talented band, but they tend to go overboard with symphonic arrangements. Songs tend to lose focus and go off track.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This latest edition of music from Shinedown is terrific.  With songs like Second Chance, Crow and Butterfly, and Call Me, this should have been a nominee for a grammy.  Shinedown is becoming a consistent leader of alternative music.    Try it out on Amazon by sampling the MP3 downloads on the website.  I think you will love what you hear.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love this show.  I have pre-ordered the season on Amazon, thus avoiding the computer generated blurbs, and commercials.  The characters are wonderful, even though they are all gorgeous and money never seems to be a problem, and neither is curfew. College would have been a more realistic setting for the characters.  Then again, its a series about vampires, werewolves, and witches, so a little more suspension of disbelief is not all that hard.  This season starts right as the first ended, at the carnival.  I anticipate each episode being better than the previous.  I love re-watching the first season, you discover new details each time you watch them.  Sit back and enjoy!  If you live Twilight you will love this.

B003XL6EKS|5.0|Kinda glad I did not read some of the other reviews before I purchased.  I was not under the impression that I was buying a Killers CD, so I am not going to compare the two.....  The 1st time I heard Brandon Flowers sing he left me questioning my knowledge of 80's music.  Had I missed something or someone????  Heard his story & I was hooked.  As far as I'm concerned it's pretty much black & white.  If you dig him you'll love it and if not don't waste your money.  I'm a big fan of emotion and he does emotion like no one else.  I could see everything play out in my head as I listened to each song, like I had my own personal music videos.  Left me pretty impressed to say the least...
1439190275|4.0|This time the book was easy to follow and read.   I received several new ideas and  it was clear and well written.    Several examples were  given and things to eat  etc.  Of course, like any diet book you have to follow the plan and they are specific in their plan not changing the wording from previous plans.   Like Induction etc.   It was a good read and one that has to be reread again to follow   the plan.
B000002WPI|5.0|You know what? I didn't even bother reading the vast amount of reviews, despite the majority of them being 5-stars, before or after I got this CD because I already realized how great it is. I'm not going to use any slang as you may expect from a person who likes certain rap/hip-hop music so I can make my point clear and not ridiculous. The 2nd track has a fun feeling to it because of its fast pace. \\"Clan in Da Front,\\" \\"Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber,\\" \\"Da Mystery of Chessboxin',\\" \\"Wu-Tang Clan Aint Nothin' to F*** With,\\" \\"C.R.E.A.M.,\\" \\"Method Man,\\" and \\"Protect Ya Neck,\\" are all worth the listening. This album sold many copies to no surprise. The lyrics are sometimes metaphoric which makes them great to go along with the beats. You won't find any love songs on this CD for sure. All consistency here. This is old-school right here!

B00005QGAX|5.0|I love this album. There's not much to say about the contents because you've probably heard 3 songs from this album from the late 1980's. If you weren't one of those lucky ones, then here's a hint for you: This dude has long hair, and he has music from this album (an amazing 5 #1's) that will rock your body! The title track opens this masterpiece. Sort of a vengeful feel you get from the song, but the beat is great. It also has an 18-minute video that is sold on one of MJ's video collections (HIStory). \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" the next #1, is a great dancing hit that also came with a video; it's a flirtatious piece from the legend. \\"Speed Demon\\" is an upbeat track about capturing somebody. Great song for driving on the highway. I liked the harmony on \\"Liberian Girl,\\" another song that had an exclusive video. It sounds darker compared to the rest of the tracks on this album, but it's a love song. \\"Just Good Friends\\" with Stevie Wonder was the song, despite not being on the charts, had me longing for getting this album. It has a great melody; it's another love song. \\"Another Part of Me,\\" another chart-topper, has a great beat and interesting lyrics. \\"Man in the Mirror,\\" which went to #1, is definitely a song worth listening to; written by Sediah Garriet, this strong hit talks about world suffering and strives for people to make a change. When I first sampled \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You,\\" it took me to another place with the beginning of the song sounding so angel-like. With it being another #1, this crescendo is a duet with the writer of the previous hit. \\"Dirty Diana,\\" another #1, stresses about the choice of cheating or not on someone. It has powerful guitar riffs that makes the song loud. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is a great dancing track that has lyrics about someone trying to escape from danger, but the way the beat goes, it makes it fun to listen to. The last album jam is \\"Leave Me Alone;\\" I used to get annnoyed by listening to this song, but I began to like it. Don't forget to listen to the extra tracks \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away.\\" The former is an upbeat flirtatious unreleased song and the latter is more about being in love. I think that \\"Fly Away\\" is peaceful. Enjoy this masterpiece.n't forget to listen to the extra tracks \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away.\\" The former is an upbeat flirtatious unreleased song and the latter is more about being in love.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|You won't regret buying this movie. Kids like it too.  The loading in the Blu ray player seems to take rather long but eventually it played without problem.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Week after week I watched this show as it initially aired and it never disappointed! The show spans every age, religion, race and creed. My parents love watching it for Chevy Chase's slap-stick humor while I started watching it because of Joel McHale's fantastic run on The Soup and I ended up falling in love with Donald Glover and Danny Pudi as Troy & Abed! Each character grows more funny and more lovable as the season continues.     But what makes this DVD set really stand out from others is the copious amount of extras: four extensive gag reels (one on each disc), highlight reels, commentary on every episode, a producers cut extended episode, and Abed's mini episodes, not to mention there's a Kick-Puncher comic book tucked inside!!    It's definitely one of the best sets I've ever purchased and recently Donald Glover said that most stores are sold out of the copies because they printed what they thought would last 6-8 weeks and it sold so fast it only lasted one week! It's impossible to be disappointed with this show and for the price they're charging, I almost bought 2 copies, one to loan out to my stubborn friends and the other to constantly keep with me to watch on repeat! You won't regret buying it!
0525951652|3.0|Roger Boylan, who reviewed Fall of Giants for the NYT Book Review, made a great comment:   \\"...if all the sex scenes were excised, it would be no loss to the narrative and a boon to the reader.\\"   Hurrah!  Maybe Ken will take notice. The sex scenes in his novels are always laughably overblown and completely superfluous, plus they actually impede the buildup of action.    I love most of his stories (Eye of the Needle is one of the best suspense stories ever written), but enough with the sex and boobs (Ken is big on big boobs, apparently).
B002VPE1B6|5.0|The quality of the movie in bluray is awesome. Does not compare to the regular vesion.
B0000AFX64|4.0|The complete series includes this with the addition of the Epilog were Baltar is spared to help the Cyclons.  The epilog is not included in this feature film release.  so if you plan to buy the series you don't need to buy this.<br /><br />If your just looking to get an Idea of how the original BattleStar Galactica was and a few of the key differences then this would be okay but I'd recommend getting the entire series as this is again included and it explains a lot more about the Cyclons and how the war with them came to be etc...
B001E1BNWI|3.0|I have recived the 5 LP, but I have not recived the bonus CD. The product is new and good, only the CD is not arrived.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great backpack. It does everything I needed. The video that I was able to review before I made my choice was really helpful. There is plenty of room for my cameras and equipment. Everything is easy to access. The price was very reasonable also. I would recommend this product to my friends.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|This film has the feel of a TV movie.  The acting is decent and the story is OK, yet the film is unsatisfying.  The characters don't get developed that well until the drama is fully unfolding, and the film is really just focused on the trauma of the 3 young adults trapped on the ski lift and their diminishing hopes for survival.  When the final rescue scene comes to its quick conclusion the viewer may also be saying \\"thank God this is over.\\" Unless you are a real fan of this type of cinematic terrorizing suspense you may want to pass on this film.
0451169514|5.0|IT is many Stephen King fans' favorite book.  Having just read the book for the first time, I can see why.  Fully realized characters, skillful juggling of two different time periods, and creepy/scary scenes throughout the novel are just some of the great things here.  Unlike some of his other books, I think the ending work well.  You won't be left hanging or unsure of what happened here.    There are some issues though.  A couple of the characters don't get the same detailed treatment that others get, so you're left trying to puzzle out some of their motivations/issues.  There's a disturbing sex scene (involving pre-teens) late in the book that undoubtedly turned some people off of the book (and all Stephen King novels) forever.  This is NOT a book for kids.  There are kids as main characters here, but it is not suitable for young people to read (I don't have an age recommendation, but the reader should be able to handle/understand references to rape, gang bangs, murder, and a whole lot of swearing).    The Signet Paperback is a good edition, with very few typos to be found (I've read that the kindle edition suffers from a lot of typos).  My only issue with it is that the text is very small and the line spacing is minimal, so even though this is nearly 1100 pages, it probably needs to be a larger book with a slightly bigger font.  Of course, at that point the book might become unwieldy to hold, so I don't know what the best solution is (though here the kindle edition probably gets an advantage).    I said at the start that this is many King fans' favorite book.  It isn't my favorite.  The Shining still holds the top spot for me.  The Stand, with its country spanning focus, edges out IT as well.  However I think it is in my top 3.  I recommend any Stephen King fan pick it up and give it a chance.
B0024FADDI|5.0|I don't own this version but, I love this movie...  I owned the VHS version YEARS AGO when I was in college.  Then after many years I got the IMO definitive edition of AOD... The BOOMSTICK Edition containing the original theatrical version with features on one disc and the Bootleg edition that contains the original unedited version which before hitting DVD all those years ago was a rumor and much sought after version.  I literally paid some money a LONG time ago for the version on VHS including the still never release to DVD unrated extended version on HELLRAISER III: Hell On Earth.  Anyways...  If you have never seen this movie or don't have it on DVD.. GET IT!  You will not be disappointed in this movie at all.<br /><br />Come to think of it...  I would buy the Book Of The Dead Edition of AOD \\"IF\\" they ever get off their butts and make one.  Would be nice to go along with the BOTD of the first and second movies.  And if you pay attention and count watching AOD, there where three versions of the book on that alter...  Two of them were made for the first two movies...  Would be nice to have the third and final book version....  Ahh, too dream.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|The next great installment of the Twilight Saga, well done, more depth to the Volturi and newborn vamps is explored.  Well done.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Judging by the reaction to some early reviews here, it is amazing the vitriol that gets tossed around when someone has the gall to question the singular \\"artistry\\" of Yoko Ono. If you are at all intellectually honest, her presence on some of John's solo work took the concept of tone-deaf family discounting into uncharted territory.    For the same reason Citizen Kane would be severely degraded by the surprise inclusion of Rosie O'Donnell trailers every few minutes (to satisfy some film student's warped appetite for the perverse) Double Fantasy, stripped or otherwise, loses almost all momentum when it downshifts from pop masterwork to avante garde experiment just to accomodate Yoko.    Back in 1980 I listened to DF endlessly before I decided to compile a \\"John Only\\" cassette. In my mind it was simply the only way to enjoy the release without pretending to buy into Yoko's unique wall of sound. Although I am absolutely sure that Yoko is a wonderful person, my opinion of her wind chime meets wood chipper vocals are not personal in the least - if she wants to represent herself as a recording artist and put herself out in the public domain, her efforts are fair game for comment (as are mine in this forum.)    That said, DF \\"Stripped\\" is an important addition to the Lennon legacy. While most songs have been subtly altered for time and production clarity several, most notably, I'm Losing You have had their vocal tracks enhanced making the expanded version a bonafide upgrade from the original CD. A worthwhile purchase warts and all.

0374158460|5.0|Jonathan Franzen's 'Freedom' is a powerful, moving and often hilarious novel chronicling the lives of an American family barely able to move through the years without encountering obstacles of their own making.      The main characters (Walt, Patty, Richard and Joey ......Jessica is relegated to a supporting role) are extremely well-drawn and reminded this reader of friends and acquaintances. Their idiosyncracies, foibles, self-delusions and downright denial form a compelling story in a book that is nearly impossible to put down.
0937381888|5.0|Of all the publications I've purchased on zymurgy, (brewing), through the years this edition of Palmer is the absolute best bar none. It is the most accurate, thorough, practical, as well as scientific. I like Papazian and Dave Miller but Palmer is the single book you cannot do without. If you're just beginning home brewing or craft-brewing or you're a brew-master at a micro-brewery this book needs to be or is likely already on your bookshelf.

0439023521|4.0|I've heard so much hype about this series.  And I've been wanting to read it for a while but just didn't have the time between review books.  So I was glad when I was finally able to.  I was worried that the book wouldn't live up to my expectations since I heard from so many people how great it was.  And while it wasn't my favorite book that I've read this year, I definitely enjoyed it.       I've heard so much about Team Peeta and Team Gale.  And I couldn't wait to read the book to see which side I fell on.  And while I don't feel we really know Gale that well (will we get the chance to in the next book??), for now I am definitely Team Peeta.  What a great and sweet guy!  He had just the right amount of tough guy and emotional guy.        Katniss was just okay for me.  She seemed too tough.  I mean, I know she had to in order to survive, but for some reason I felt that I couldn't really get into her.  Maybe I will in the next book.       But boy, I hated when I had to put this book down to go to bed at night.  I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen next.  So many different things were thrown at us.  It was like watching a reality show in my head (one with horrible consequences).  And the idea of having to live in a world where so many children are given up for death every year is just horrifying!  I have Catching Fire sitting right here and I can't wait to dive into it!
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I liked the original 1981 version.This one is also great entertainment.A superb cast once again headlines the retelling of a classic story.I love these kind of movies.I hope to see more like it in the near future.Sam Worthington was great in \\"AVATAR\\",and made an excellent Perseus.Liam Neeson is one of my many favorite actors,and was awesome in the role of Zeus.CGI effects made the creatures even more scary.
0143039504|5.0|These stories are classic and great, so basicly they are classicly great! I love that they have combined them all into one large book, i thought it would intimidate me at first but you really just get sucked in to the jane austen world from the first page. And for me just reading one story at a time and then taking a break in between or reading another book really helped to keep it fresh and interesting everytime! They were so easy to read, and you just fall in love with the charecters. You will feel so compelled to read them over and over again!
0596805888|5.0|The title itself told me that this would *have* to be a very fun and informative book (geeks in the kitchen playing science, hello?), and I was not disappointed! The writing style is relaxed and a bit goofy, which goes a long way into making this a fun read. (Let's face it, there is a fair share of books out there about molecular gastronomy, that are almost indigestible.) This book teaches you the how's and why's of cooking; what is actually happening, in a small level, when you are boiling this, deep-frying that, performing x technique. It empowers you to let go of recipes a bit and try creating your own. Highly recommended!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I completely agree J. Craig. I cannot put this book down! I find myself thinking about the characters while I'm working during the day, I'm reading at lunch, while I make dinner, before bed, as soon as I get up in the morning. It's been a long time since I have had a good, long, juicy book like this. And fortunately we know there will be 2 more books! I must admit that I did think long and hard about paying the $19.99 since part of the big advertising for Kindle was that books would be basically $9.99 or less. However, I considered that 985 pages for $19.99 was actually a pretty good buy and (here's the kicker) I downloaded a Sample and that was the \\"fall\\" of this \\"giant\\". I HAD to have it then and find out what happens
B003V5PPZG|5.0|This is my first on-line album review (and I'm 44).  I've been a fan of Lincoln Park for many years and have loved every album.  One thing they can't be accused of is being predictable or having a \\"sound\\".  A Thousands Suns is short and sweet (what others say about short interludes/fillers is true) but the effect is amazing and once again well worth the money....although if you're under 20, I suspect most of you will better appreciate the angst of the prior (and younger) Lincoln Park creations so try them first if you haven't.....this album's angst likely better appreciated a bit later in life.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I understand that authors and publishers and retailers want to get paid for the work they have done. That's fair. Charging more for an electronic version than the hardcopy though, which had to be printed, bound and stored is ridiculous. I won't pay 9.99 for a Kindle book that I can't loan to a friend or sell back to a used book store, let alone this absolutely outrageous price of 19.99. When will publishers realize that the digital pricing scheme is different? The music industry is adapting, I suppose now we'll have to deal with the growing pains of the publishing industry. For now, I'm joining the hundreds of other boycotting this book and possibly every Penguin book until they get their act straight. Vote with your pocketbooks people.
0061537969|5.0|My best friend is an extremely talented driver.  I sometimes wonder how he can do the things he does on a racetrack.  So it didn't surprise me when I was at his home one day and saw \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" sitting on his entertainment stand.  What caught my eye was the dog on the front cover of the book.  Obviously this wasn't just an instructional book, but a novel.  I asked him if he had read it yet to which he replied that he hadn't had the time to start it.  I read the inside cover and it seemed like something I would enjoy, since I have an extreme fondness of dogs and had just recently lost my golden retriever.  I purchased this book a few days later and I know for a fact this book will be read by me many more times!    To describe the emotions you experience from reading \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is like describing to someone the scope of human emotions.  I laughed.  I cried.  I was furious.  I was filled with hate.  I was filled with love.  I was elated.  I felt informed.  The emotions and talented writing in this book make it an amazing read for any adult.  Younger children would definitely not understand the many heartaches and trials and tribulations of life, but could still get a great experience out of this novel.    If you're looking for a recommendation for your next novel, \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is without question, THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.

B001L4NJIO|5.0|\\"Certifiable: Live in Buenos Aires\\" (2008) is a Blu-ray concert disc by The Police.  This BD was recorded over two nights in Buenos Aires in December 2007 during The Police's 30th anniversary Reunion Tour, which was their first tour since 1984.    There are two Dolby TrueHD 96kHz, 24-bit audio tracks, 5.1 and 2.0, and both are reference quality (for rock music, at least). There are no gimmicks in the 5.1 mix, as the surround channels are used judiciously for atmosphere and ambience.    The video is in crystal clear 1080i HD quality. The video editing is professional and engaging, if not a little frenetic.    Oh, by the way, the band's performance is incredible. I am only a casual fan of The Police, and I was blown away. Sting always struck me as a bit of a poseur, but he can really play the bass, and his voice sounds as good as it did in the early 1980's.    Andy Summers seems like a reluctant rock star, but he can shred on guitar when he wants to, and he certainly does so on this BD.    Stewart Copeland is recognized as a monster rock drummer, and this BD will only add to his well-deserved reputation for excellence.    There are many instrumental interludes where the band rocks out, and to hear and see this virtuosic jamming in ultra-hi-rez audio and video quality is a revelation as to what is possible for BD concert discs.    As if all that were not enough, the BD includes a 51-minute documentary about The Police's 2007 Reunion Tour in 1080i/Dolby TrueHD 96kHz, 24-bit 2.0 audio entitled, \\"Better Than Therapy\\" that is always interesting and occasionally hilarious.    And on top of all that, the set includes two RBCD's of the same musical sequence on the BD.    In the end, though, the reasons to own \\"Certifiable\\" on BD are the two hi-rez audio tracks, which, as far as sound quality is concerned, are at least the equal if not better than the best-sounding rock SACD's I have heard.    \\"Certifiable\\" on BD can be a little tricky to locate for purchase online, as it wasreleased exclusively through Best Buy in the United States. I found a new copy on eBay for $20.95 + $2.99 shipping, but I would have considered it a bargain at the $34.99 Best Buy list price. (Note: There is also a two-DVD/two-CD version of \\"Certifiable,\\" so be careful when ordering.)
B00275EHJG|5.0|I was very excited to know that they were coming out with another Toy Story.  I grew up on Toy Story, so to see them make another one and not ruin it was awesome.  Buzz, The Potato family, and man.. Ken and Barbie were hilarious!!!  I loved this film, in my personal opinion this is the best Toy Story film out of the three.  I'm so glad that they took there time preparing it so it wouldn't be a massacre.  I highly recommend this movie to all ages.

0440243688|5.0|Gone Tomorrow is a fabulous bit of escapism.  The first line hooked me and I stayed hooked.  This is a novel I shared with my seventy-five year old father, who loved it, and lent to a friend (who liked it so much he passed it on).  Mr. Child kills the people in the novel who need killing and in such a way that the reader champions Reacher's effort.  One of my favorite Reacher novels.  A great way to spend a flight, a sunny afternoon or when insomnia hits, but be warned: Once you read the first line it's pretty hard to put down.

B0035V35P8|1.0|If you understand the demographics this pathetic filth is trying to target (snot nosed, acne prone, pea brains who play idiotic video games all day and have never read a real book in their life, with the IQ of a dead corpse), then you can understand how it garners such high reviews on movie sites.<br /><br />But don't' be fooled, it's an inept, violent movie that doesn't offer a thing except more mindless violence.  Yes, the violence looks like an awful cartoon but to the uninitiated mall geek, it's nothing but a sugar rush of violence for the few brain cells inhabiting their empty skulls.<br /><br />This movie was so stupid my fellow professors couldn't even watch more than 6 minutes of it, and even that was too much. I sat through the whole fetid rotten egg of it.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone with a brain.  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Looks more like a shoddy video game than a movie, which probably explains the high ratings it gets from 11 year old boys.<br /><br />The fake CGI action is entirely inadequate, and completely unrealistic.  The action scenes were overdone to the point that they were ridiculous. Heads getting sliced in half. Arms getting hacked off. It looked so fabricated.  Rain as Raizo, the lead protagonist, was eminently mediocre, and everybody else was wretched.  What a pile of garbage.<br /><br />Ninja Assassin is a painfully, tortuously slow movie. I absolutely love martial arts films and action/adventure films but this movie was nothing but blood and excessive gore with no plot, and no really interesting action.<br /><br />Save yourself some time and watch something else more enjoyable, like trees growing.
B000JU7NCE|5.0|For those that think this is over produced, I would totally disagree. I loved the production. So many close ups of the band members it felt like I was on stage with them. Concert videos can get boring, but this video added a lot of special effects which I thought were very cool. I would highly recommend this, just as good as going to a concert if not better. I do wish they would have had more of their popular songs on this, but they still had enough good ones to make it worth while. But if you want to see and feel what its like to be on stage, this gives you that feel.
0470477237|5.0|I have re lunched my site with Social media accounts like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn in August of 2010.  My web site is no longer a static page; it is built on a wrodpress platform. I have finished reading Socialnomics couple of days ago and gave myself sometime to digest and evaluate about everything Erik Qualman was talking about in his book.  Web 2.0 or Social Media works without a doubt. One can't expect to see immediate results. I have met people using Twitter that I would have never met otherwise. These connections helped me to learn more about how this Web 2.0 thing operates. My Facebook Fan page has been growing every week. I communicate with people from all over the world via Twitter @AskDrBurt about any health related Questions. LinkedIn and YouTube are other channels where Socialnomics applies.  Mr. Qualman wrote the book about the present and the future of the Web 2.0  Any serious self employed individual must read this book from the beginning to the end and get a basic understanding about Social Media and how it works. One must also apply the Social Media Concept into his or her business model. Thumbs up Erik.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|I have to be honest, upon first hearing that the Lennon albums would be remastered once again I asked, \\"why?\\" It initially seemed like another way of Yoko cashing in on the already released catalog of John. My opinion changed when I read further into it and learned the specifics: the remasters would be culled from the original mixes (the last ones were remixed by Ono, although that take on the albums was interesting, they weren't the originals) and another selling point was they were handled by the same team that did the Beatles' issues last year, which were fantastic.  After looking into what albums were exactly in the set and seeing a preview of the packaging; I ultimately decided it was worth my investment, especially since I didn't invest in all of the Ono remixes. Upon receiving the set today, it was everything I expected it to be.     The sound quality is a vast improvement on the original CD issues of the late 80s/early 90s, obviously, and this was the most important aspect of the set to me.  All the studio albums are present from \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" to \\"Double Fantasy.\\" Also included is the posthumous \\"Milk and Honey,\\" which although wasn't supervised by Lennon at any point, is restored to the original 1984 mix.  \\"Sometime in New York City\\", released in the remix issues in a truncated form, is presented in it's double disc format with the entire \\"Live Jam\\" present.  The last time I heard the disc was in the mid 90s as an ignorant teenager, so getting a second chance to experience and opine it gave me another aspect of the set to look forward to.  Getting to hear my two favorite Lennon albums \\"Mind Games\\" and \\"Walls and Bridges\\" in their released mixes with the restored sound is what really hit it home to me. As much as I find myself crediting Paul McCartney as the more melodically gifted Beatle, it's always Lennon's solo work I seem to be drawn to most out of all the boys.  The supplements here are a disc of the non-album singles and another of demos and rehearsals. I could say the unreleased material was a bit skimpy, but after being graced with the \\"Lennon Anthology\\" and all the other positive aspects of this boxed set, how much more could be jammed into this? Anything further would really be overwhelming.  Ono has spoke of attempting to figure out a clever way to release more of the rare stuff anyway. So, I think we can all sit back, bask in these remasters for the time being and patiently wait for more releases. After all you don't eat your dinner and dessert all at once, so let's space things out here.    In conclusion, this set for a true Lennon fan, or maybe even a casual admirer, is a good deal. People have complained of the \\"Double Fantasy: Stripped Down\\" mix being absent, and I can say I wasn't too deterred from having to purchase it separately as it's moderately priced.

0553805371|5.0|Professor Hawking's January 1999 lecture \\"Quantum Cosmology, The M Theory and the Anthropic Principle\\" goes into  lots of detail for those who would like an extension of the basics contained in The Grand Design.  In this lecture, complete with powerpoint slides, Hawking cuts through ###-to-the-nth-power odds and ultimately comes back to the Anthropic Principle.  Rosenblum and Kuttner,  (Oxford University Press 2006, ASIN:019534250X Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness] move the discussion along into \\"spooky actions at a distance,\\" which Einstein discussed with them at Princeton in the 1950s.  Reg Saner's new book [[ASIN:1935195085 Living Large in Nature: A Writer's Idea of Creationism] provides a profoundly entertaining Darwinian bridge for those traveling the gap between small minds and  the grand design--via the wonders of the natural world right here on Planet Earth.

B002GJT4Y6|5.0|This is the best thing for those who love the Harry Potter series!! It has everything you could ask for or expect. Including the extended edition of the movie which if you watch ABC family you become accustomed to. As an added bonus it comes with a digital copy of the movie, but that does expire Dec. 8th, 2010. The booklet and the cards are well made and very interesting. I love all of it a very good buy!!!

I can't enjoy it if I can't read the whole story, and that's why I'm giving it a one-star rating. Would really appreciate it if the whole trilogy is available overseas.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Simply put, this album is one of the best I have heard from any band in the last 2 years.<br />Want more detail?  OK.<br />The music is well constructed, driven, and at no point does a song leave the feeling that it is just there to fill out the album.  The production sound is also done well, which is only to be expected with the near-unlimited budget available to Metallica.  This album features input from Robert Trujillo (formerly with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves, and a number of other bands) who delivers just what this band needed: raw energy.<br />Overall, the album is enjoyable to listen to, and will undoubtedly remain in my favorites for many years.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am a 41 yr old mom of 3 boys 6 and under.  I haven't exercised regularly since 2002 when I swam multiple miles per week.  Was looking for a workout that was fun, fast, and effective.  I would give Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shed very high marks for all 3 of those things.  My problem was that 3 weeks in I blew my left knee out.  And I have NEVER had knee problems before. The entire strength and cardio portions of level I and II (I only did level II once) are VERY knee intensive.  Jumping jacks, jumping rope, squats, lunges, etc.  If you are just starting out like I was, BE CAREFUL and take your time getting into it.  I paid very close attention to my form, eg not squatting too low and keeping my back straight. I wish I had ramped up more slowly and did extra knee and leg stretches on my own before and after doing the workout.  Now I am on naproxen round the clock for 2 weeks and off to see an orthopedist and probably PT after that.  I was in tears last night because I really enjoyed doing this workout and felt I was seeing some early results.
0882709194|1.0|Oh my, oh my. Where do I start?    Two copies of this book were sneakily passed on to myself and my husband as we left the Progressive Forum at the Wortham Center tonight--a book tour for Richard Dawkins' \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\". A couple of normal, smart-looking people came walking the other way as we exited and a female asked, \\"Do you guys want some copies of 'the Origin of Species'?\\" We excitedly said \\"Well, yeah!\\", and took them, feeling like we'd just gotten really lucky. The couple were 20 feet away before my husband muttered, \\"Waitaminute...\\" as he looked at the cover: \\"Special Introduction by Ray Comfort\\".    Face-palm time.    What low-down, dirty tactics. The two of us were well aware that this \\"book\\" existed. An abridged (totally chopped up) version of Darwin's classic, the majority of the book in TINY, hard-to-read text with a FIFTY PAGE foreword by Banana Man Ray Comfort.    What saddens me most is that if the two who had handed us this book had actually not been too scared to come to this lecture, I have a feeling they wouldn't have been passing these books out.    Please, if you want to buy a copy of The Origin of Species, do yourself a favor and buy an official version on Amazon. Don't give this man any money if you wish to check it out--request a free copy from the kooks handing it out at college campuses and atheist talks.    I'm glad we got two copies, though. That's two less that will be foisted on naive young people.

B003YLK2RI|5.0|Is this a Slipknot DVD or a flag waving contest???? yes sarcasim, lowest form of wit.<br />10/10 for the show, (however the flags were distracting and covered up some intense shots of Corey & the band, before they tore Download a new a**hole with a blistering (sic)).<br />Fantastic performance. Coreys voice is in top form, and the shenanigans from the band members are a highlight. (Especially Clown when he picks up a keg and throws it at Craig).<br />Documentary is so, so. Film clips and the making of Snuff were interesting, nothing like seeing the lead singer of a metal band shaving his legs.<br />Highly recommended for Slipknot fans who are sick of watching live clips on you-tube, or have played Disasterpiece to death.

0385342047|3.0|Sophie Kinsella has written six books in her Shopaholic Series. The first three books were cute and endearing. Becky's various dramas and inability to save money were amusing. Her skill at finding a way to fix everything at the last minute had you rooting for her throughout the story. I found these books to be quite enjoyable.    The last two books in the series were a different story. Becky showed little growth as a character. Her antics-which started off as funny-became repetitive. When I'm reading a story, I hope to see the main character grow and change; something Becky seems unable to do. Her lack of growth led to books that felt repetitive and formulaic.    This disappointing pattern is not broken in Mini Shopaholic. The only difference in Becky's latest adventure is the addition of a two-year-old accomplice. Becky is now able to excuse her shopping habits by passing them off as her daughter's. This small addition is not enough to make the plot interesting. I struggled to get through the first half of the book. I kept hoping that the \\"How does Becky get herself out of trouble this time\\" storyline was enough to continue reading. Luckily it was worth the wait.    The first half of this book was mostly a tale of self-indulgence and reckless behavior. By contrast, the second half was interesting and moving. I enjoyed how the relationship between Luke and his estranged mother was explored. This story grabbed my attention and made me want to keep reading. The storyline did not entirely save the book, but made me glad I stuck with it.    As always, the book ended as a setup for another addition in the Shopaholic series. I would be interested in reading this next book to see what is in store for Luke and his mother. Unfortunately I feel this followup story will again focus primarily on Becky and her flighty tendencies. I would have hoped by now that she had learned something, but clearly not. Perhaps the next tale will be the one in which we finally see Becky grow asa character.    Review: I feel as if this book would be more enjoyable to someone unfamiliar with the series. As a standalone story, the plot is interesting. As part of a series, it feels recycled. There are only so many times I can read about Becky's repeated mistakes before I start wondering why she has yet to learn anything. For fans of the series, I suggest this as a library read. It is OK but not worth the $13.50 purchase price.
B003Y3BMFW|4.0|Whether or not you were around when Soundgarden came to be known, all fans alike should grab this cd/dvd \\"best of\\" albumn. The music and videos on Telephantasm give you a great feel for what the band was about- playing loud, fast, poetic music for people just like them selfs who just don't give a bleep. The albumn isn't perfect though. Like others have said, some songs are on A-sides just live and some videos are a little weak. A lot  depends on your personal taste though. Telephantasm could have used more unreleased songs, i don't feel like there was enough but i might just be greedy for more Soundgarden. But come on, who isn't??? You also can't beat a 3-disc set with unreleased songs and videos for only $15 either.

B0036EH3XE|4.0|A co-worker of mine once told me in no uncertain terms that she hated Lost and thought that it was one of the dumbest shows on TV. When I pressed her for an explanation as to why she hated the show, she had to admit that she had only watched a few of the episodes, and that her opinion of the show's ending came to her second-hand. A friend of hers had been a faithful viewer of the show from episode #1 and SHE didn't like the ending, and it was that attitute my co-worker picked up on. I recount this because the attitude of either not being involved or wanting to be spoon fed all the answers seems almost endemic in modern viewing audiences. A pity, really, and a certain Hell's fury on those who expect the easy way out when it comes to this show. Lost demands that a) you see all that came before in order to know and appreciate what's happening now, and b) that you don't expect certain outcomes. The joy of this show is in the human drama and the overall message(s). Sure it gets a bit loose at times, a bit too much like Survivor, if you will. One wonders who's going to join with whom from week to week, or be banished.<br /><br />As a whole I found Lost to be quite entertaining, certainly no less so in this final season than any other. It not without some excess -- there's more people being killed than I generally like to see, more people being shot, blown up, drowned, punched into submission, or just plain having guns drawn on them. But it still works overall.<br /><br />Season 6 is the culmination of a long story about what was and what could be, about how people need each other, about hope and challenge, change and stasis, death and rebirth, and ages-old mysteries and common human frailties. As for the ending, well, that you can interpret your way. Like it or don't like it, dig or don't dig the quasi-religious or supernatural angle. Same goes for the various archetypes, the motifs, the subtexts, the philosophy, its relationship to mythology (and it's own internal mythology)---whatever. None of it is particularly easy. But it is fun, and bully for you if you get a charge out of  the ride, the message, and the art.r. None of it is particularly easy.

B0010YPTAQ|5.0|Out of my entire collection, this is one of the best sounding new vinyl records I've ever come across. I wanted to give some details on the 2008 reissue Amazon is selling.<br /><br />The jacket is a quality gatefold, with black matte finish. Minimalist artwork. Commentary by Daniel Miller on the album's impact and success. Inner sleeve is printed with lyrics and artwork. Vinyl is thick, 180 gram, little to no surface noise. Sibilance becomes noticeable with the inner bands (likely cartridge misalignment at the time), but overall quality is very good! Printed in Canada.<br /><br />If you have to buy this album, I highly recommend the vinyl release.
1401324029|5.0|The story was as good as the show.  Would definitely recommended it to viewers of the show.
0143114085|2.0|Admittedly, I flew through the first part of the book. I couldn't wait to figure out \\"whodunnit.\\" Combine that with a very slow beginning and I was really anxious to get through the novel. Unfortunately, the ending is highly unsatisfying. SPOILERS I don't necessarily have anything against novels in which the narrator is unreliable. But this one was just too much for me. Completely unsatisfying ending. Someone mentioned that they skipped to the end to find out the \\"surprise ending\\" and then read the book through. That would probably be a more entertaining way to read the book, because then you'd more clearly see all the ways the narrator is unreliable and all the things she says that don't make sense if you don't know the ending. That and the so called \\"relationship\\" between Simon and Alice was quickly wrapped up in the end in an irksome, rushed, unfulfilling and unrealistic way.     I also don't like the literary device Hannah uses here-- a chapter or so of police procedural, and then a chapter or so of what happened with the victim. The two types of chapters don't start off at the same time period as each other, and then slowly they end up working their way to being on the same day/time. Reading the chapters this way can get confusing and annoying-- you don't even figure out the actual crime until you've read about five chapters in. It's hard to keep track of what happened before what and to remember what happened two chapters before.    And finally, a minor nitpick here-- lines like \\"Will our friendship be taken further?\\" (on the last page of the book) drive me crazy-- who talks like that in real life? Especially when Alice and Simon barely had a friendship to begin with?    In summary, while the book certainly makes you anticipate a surprise ending, it doesn't actually deliver, leaving the reader unsatisfied and, honestly, feeling like the time spent reading it could've been better spent. A mystery novel with some aspects of this book (suspense, unreliable storytelling) that's way better, check out The Little Stranger by Sarah Waters. It's a bit more of a \\"lit\\" book, but one of my favorites. I will probably read Hannah again, as I've heard good things about some of her other books.
B001RNI34E|1.0|I just finally got around to reading this book - or trying to. It starts on page 57! Goes on to page 120, and then starts over again - with page 57. Nowhere in the book are there any pages numbered 1 - 56. Of course, it's too late to return it, but I would not have paid to send it back anyway. It'll come in handy come winter. Makes for a nice fire starter.
B0038Z5T4Q|4.0|Although I had seen Wall Street when it came out and several times since then, I wanted to have the original movie to go with the sequel when it comes out in DVD.  I am a Michael Douglas fan but not a Charlie Sheen fan...however, both did a fantastic job in portraying their characters.  Martin Sheen didn't do a bad job either.  Some reviewers commented on poor visual quality of the film which didn't bother me as much as it seemed to bother them.  Looking forward to seeing the sequel and hope Michael Douglas has many more years to enjoy his family and friends in addition to giving great performances playing a wide variety of characters.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I received this movie yesterday and I saw it three times already !  Once without commentary and twice with commentary. You can learn so much about this movie when the two of the stars in the movie and the director are  talking about the scenes. The story is so much better than any other gay themed movies I have ever seen. It was so sweet and romantic. I fell in love with all the characters in the movie after watching it the first time. This movie is made with love and it shows every scene of the movie. It makes you laugh,it makes you cry and it makes your heart feel fuzzy all at the same time.  Even though this movie is about two guys in love,it won't show any of those flamboyant acting gay characters at all but a lot of surf scenes and skateboarding. I'm sure I'll watch this movie again and again. And I know I don't think I'll ever get tired of it. This movie won't disappoint you if you are thinking about getting one for yourself. I wish I have found a love just like in this movie.
B0018BF1LS|4.0|For anyone who wants to purchase the five albums listed, this is a good deal.  This is part of a collection of similar titles that have been released over the years.  While the title says 'Original Album Classics'-they're really the updated releases with all the bonus tracks.  Each disc slips inside it's own thick cardboard reproduction of the original album cover.  The downside is that there's no paper protection for the discs, but as long as you're careful you won't get any scratches.  The five discs are then slipped into a fairly flimsy cardboard case, open at one end-beware the discs don't slip out accidentally.  There are no notes whatsoever-just the music in the latest updated sound.  This is a good deal if all you want is the music.  Cheers.
B003DZX3US|5.0|Hi. Me and my sister absolutely loved this movie since 2008. When I got this DVD Combo Pack, I felt quite excited and thirsty.(Again, the DVD combo: DVD in front of 2 Blu-Ray discs and different box.) I watched it on Blu-Ray and it was so darn great. Has the best restoration and roaring sound. If you have a blu-ray player, get it. If you don't, get it if you ARE trying to get a BR player or wait till Nov. 23 for the 2-Disc DVD. LIMITED TIME ONLY.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I won't be buying this book for now.  Have enjoyed Follett's work in the past, but price is an issue for me, especially with my Kindle hardware outlay.  There is so much to read that I can afford to wait on this title for the time being.   Buying a Kindle has been a poor decision for me in hindsight.  I paid $269 and it now is $139. Although most of the books I have purchased have been $9.99, more and more the prices are increasing.  Now this book at $19.99?!!  Lastly, there have been several titles I have wanted, but are unavailable in Kindle format.    It's a nice device, but Amazon isn't doing much to keep my business.  Blaming the publishers is a cop out.  Amazon needs to aggressively negotiate deals with the publishers that allows them to price books as advertised with the Kindle purchase.

This shows how greedy corporate America is and how Authors are out of touch with their customers and supporters.     I will give you a little bit of advice you Publishers, Authors and Amazon.com. Your ebook market will face the same fate the music and movie industry has been facing for years. \\"DOWNLOADING\\"! People will find out,they can download your expensive books for FREE and will flock in great numbers to get them! It isn't so hard to find either. A little Google search for the name of the book along with certain search tags. BOOM! You are the ones shaping this brand new market. It can go one of two way, books are priced at a reasonable rate, where we get good books at a discounted price(considering there is no overhead) or the bad way. We wont buy and just download it. How much money would you lose then?     I wont be buying any books priced above $9.99.
0312600844|5.0|This book is so great; I just wish it got a little more publicity. (Tip your waitresses; I'll be here all week).  Seriously, there is little point to reviewing a book that is on Oprah's list.  Simply put: this is about as good as it gets in modern fiction - whatever that says about modern fiction.    The primary negative critics - at least those who are not distracted by their own petty jealousies -  accuse the author of deriving multiple story arcs that are not believable.  I suppose they represent some level of extreme. But, they are certainly not beyond the pale.    Franzen most likely draws greatly from personal experience in Freedom - as most good authors do.  His descriptions of Midwestern culture, college kids at \\"shows,\\" and even the more gratuitous sexual situations reek of familiarity even if we do not want to admit it.  Most Americans will identify to varying extents with the characters and the premises in the story.  And, that's what makes for a fantastic novel.      My complaints are far too minor to significantly lower the rating of the book.  Some of the grossly sexual (and sometimes just gross) situations do not significantly advance the story.  And, Franzen gets stuck on certain descriptors such as \\"fatuity,\\" \\"brocade,\\" and various forms of \\"pique\\" (\\"piquant\\" etc.).  And, I completely agree with the negative ninnies who indicate that Franzen forgt the voice of the lead female \\"autobiographer.\\"  She sounded amazingly like Jonathan Franzen through most of her dialogue.  I just don't see this as a fatal flaw.      But, after reading about Patty the underachieving granola wanna-be, Walter the uptight, self-loathing, elitist, Richard the arrogant tortured soul who never left college (or at least didn't want to), or Joey know-it-all yet fractious college Republican, tell me that you do not identify with one character and know the others in various forms.  The best stories always elicit that response of \\"Hey, that's me\\" or \\"Oh my God, I so know that chick.\\"    Whatever statements Freedom makes about American life in the 21st Century, it is stunningly accurate.  This makes for an entertaining, yet reflective read.    Read it.  Either because Obama read it; Oprah told you so; you want to be condescending hater that wants to join the argument; or you actually want to be entertained and challenged.

B0002KVUKM|2.0|If there is substance in this film it is lost in action. The movie is one of those typical high budget summer hits, having the lifetime of 1 summer. Once you have seen it there is very little that makes you wan't to see it again and the movie does not make a worthy investment. The movie does have EVERYTHING, Dracula, werewolves, the Frankenstein monster, Mr. Hyde, Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Van Helsing and an odd friar for comic relief. But since it has everything there is little room for a good story, only short plot drivers to connect endless action scenes built around computer generated graphics. I probably would have enjoyed it better if I was 12.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|The publisher expects more for the kindle electronic version than the hardback.  It is unfortunate the publishing industry continues to live in the past.

I noticed the book is falling down the rankings.  Too bad for Mr. Follet,  good for the consumer.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is a very good movie. Koreans have been making ambitious movies lately like Ta Guk Gi - Brotherhood and Natural City which are among the best from Asian Cinema. Oldboy is better than these and on par with movies like Resevoir Dogs.     It tells the story of a drunken man who is all of a sudden kidnapped for no reason he can imagine and is held captive for a very long time, on a Monte Cristo timescale. The movie is very brutal and full of dark humour. The begining scene where our hero is a drunken nuisance is the most believable and amusing drunk I have seen in a movie and I should know, since I am a police officer myself. Then there are scenes where he confronts a man who is about to commit suicide by jumping off a tall building and a brutal fight where he takes on a large group of criminals. All are well thought out and realistic. All of this goes on while the main plot unfolds, why was he held captive, for what reason and by who. And those aren't even the right questions. There are bigger surprises in store.     To fully appreciate the movie you will need a dark sense of humour and a desire for mystery. But should you fulfill this criteria - Oldboy will leave you mightly pleased.

B003ZD9DUC|5.0|Yes it may be \\"bare bones\\" compared to newer blu-ray releases(this isn't critereon), but this version rocks. I've seen mad max probably 102 times starting on VHS as a kid, and i'm just noticing all the details (badge numbers, signs, brands, etc) i've never seen in any of the other releases. Picture quality to me is awesome (just noticed the Nightrider has a small tattoo on one of his toes). Thats how much detail you'll see. I don't see any fan of the road warrior or mad max being disappointed by this. As mentioned in other reviews, the superior australian audio track is on by default which after seeing the special edition release from a few years back is the way to watch it. I watched a few times through with the sub-titles on just to catch some of their slang/colloquialism's. I really didn't notice any issues with color or noise in the movie. Everything was just very sharp on a 2009 1080P 27\\" dell IPS PC monitor. I don't have hi-def audio running from my PC so I can't comment on the HD sound, otherwise everything was great. Per the product description the DVD is an actual seperate disc unlike HD-DVD releases that put the DVD on one side of the HD-DVD disc. So you basically get 2 copies albeit one that is SD. If you're looking for the truely objective review, I'd check out dvdbeaver dot com for their eventual review.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I am a professional photographer and use backpacks for carrying wedding gear.  I had a camera bag get ruined at the last wedding, so I purchased this bag to fill in.  The price is great, the comfort is great.  It reminds me of my old \\"canon\\" backpack, although maybe a wee-bit smaller.  I was still able to fit my D700 and my d300 with lens, a flash, a fixed lens, and assorted batteries/memory cards and flash adapter.  But it was PACKED><br /><br />HOWEVER, my biggest complaint with this bag is the AMAZON logo on EVERY SINGLE ZIPPER.  So the bag 5 zippers that are viewable to all... and 2 more on the interior.  Every single one has DUAL sided (14 in all) Amazon Basic written on them in ORANGE on a black bag.  Why, why, why.  I don't want to advertise that I purchased this bag from Amazon, Amazon is a place to purchase not a prestigious logo.  This is very disappointing to me, as to me it makes the bag less desirable.  I feel like a walking billboard.  Going to try black sharpie on the zippers, but I doubt it will work, since the letters are raised.
0465043577|4.0|Benoit Mandelbrot's The (Mis) Behavior of Markets is a splendid read and very informative. As many reviewers have noted, Mandelbrot invented fractal geometry. He has also been on the cutting edge (some would say fringe, but he's thinking and questioning) in multiple disciplines, as his curiosity seem to know no bounds. Mandelbrot does a good job of describing the inadequacies of the efficient market hypothesis and CAPM and other sacrosanct theories in finance, and he offers for our consideration an alternative view. His view is based on his assertion of reality; namely that the world of finance is turbulent (as indeed, the world is turbulent), and linear tools relying on reliability and rational man will never tell the full story.     Mandelbrot, to his credit, warns the reader early on that his is not an investment guide. He simply offers his ideas, and admits that some don't offer as much insight currently as he wishes. He is, however, optimistic that his philosophies and his alternative (edge-type) thinking will prevail in some form.     Truly wish I read this before b-school, as he explains why I scratched my head through a good portion because the theories didn't look \\"right.\\" As a couple of other reviewers have noted, the first part of the book is best, and sort of stumbles to find itself in the second half. All that said, this is a valuable contribution and highly recommended.
B002OG5GT8|5.0|For the price, this amp gives a huge boost over the output from an MP3 player. I'm using to power my old Sony MDR-V700 headphones, which are rated at 3,000mW, so the piddling 10 an average player puts out just doesn't do the job.<br /><br />No, this isn't an ultra high end amp, and its not going to blow your mind with its sound. However, for the cheap price, and small form factor, its a great value.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Will not buy at this price and Ken is one of my favorite authors.  It's a shame that publishers have to be this greedy.
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|...but in the end, I think he and Joe created a well-polished album that is lush in tone and creative enough to stand apart from some of Joe's recent works.    Production Quality: Again, with Fraser at the helm, I thought I would hear a lot of clipping and dynamic range compression (which appeared gratuitously on \\"Death Magnetic\\"), but so far I have yet to detect any. This is a plus, especially given some of the recent works that have succumb to the loudness war who otherwise are above all that (Rush's \\"Vapor Trails,\\" Porcupine Tree's \\"Deadwing,\\" etc.). The drum cymbals are a bit loud for my taste, but not overwhelming (like they are with some of Riverside's early recordings). Joe is almost exclusively an Ibanez guitar player, and the strong mid-range of Ibanez guitars resonates throughout. And, as the first reviewer mentioned, KEYBOARDS! I'm so happy to hear a keyboard layered into a Joe CD. He attempted some of this on \\"Engines of Creation,\\" but it didn't sit right with me due to the electronica-style percussion that accompanied it (although I think he hit a home run with the keyboard layering on \\"Until We Say Goodbye\\"). All in all, it sounds \\"thicker\\" and more harmonious than the Satchfunkulous album, and cleaner than Super Colossal.    Content/Writing: I think Joe is at a point where he has found a groove, one that makes you want to go back to the CD and hear bits and pieces repeatedly. One thing about this and his last two CDs that made me give four stars instead of the typical Fanboy Five is that while all the songs are \\"good,\\" there isn't one or two that really stand out to me. For example, when I listen to \\"The Extremist,\\" I'm astounded by how catchy and unique each individual song is - from the opener \\"Friends\\" all the way to the closer \\"New Blues.\\" On that record, Joe took chances (like the song \\"Why\\" and its multi-harmonic overdubs), and also played it safe (\\"Cryin'\\"), but created a lot of catchy tunes (\\"Summer Song,\\" \\"Rubina's,\\" \\"War,\\" \\"The Extremist,\\" etc.). Likewise on Surfing with the Alien and other older albums. I'm not saying this album is bad, I'm just saying that there isn't much that stands out as VERY extraordinary like he made with songs such as \\"Crush of Love\\" (possibly his most famous), \\"Surfing with the Alien,\\" or \\"Flying in a Blue Dream.\\"    Bottom line: Satch fans will love it, it is better than the previous two releases (for me), and is overall a pleasant listening experience.
B003TML0VO|2.0|My main complaint is that the songs on this album were recorded too hot. As in all the controls set on '11', no dynamic range, too much bass (Although there was a time that such a complaint would not have come from me), harsh glaring highs that get uncomfortable for me to listen to...  Unless I turn it down, and there's no fun in that.     I didn't read all these reviews, but I gathered two main points from the negative ones...    1- Song selection-- isn't this always an issue with compilations of previously released songs? Overall, I enjoyed the choices made, but would've made 2 or 3 changes.      2- Not up to Sanatana's standards-- I've a little trouble with that one. Starting from ALL the way back, I always thought he played a pretty guitar (speaking as a music fan, I'm not a musician) but was never crazy about his songs. I liked his latin flavored instrumentals ('Festival', on vinyl, is the only Santana I ever bought) the best.         I stumbled across a couple John Lee Hooker songs that had Santana playing on them. Tell you what... 'The Healer' and \\"Chill Out' are two great tunes if you're interested in JLH with a latin flavor. I wish there were many CDs with these two guys together.         Anyway, the JLH songs got me to investgating Santana a little, which brought me here. I guess I have to agree... the guitar isn't sweet, or alive, like you'd expect from CS.    So, song selection I'm basically ok with + Borderline unlistenable recording + lifeless playing = 2 stars.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californication is one of my favorite albums of all time. It's amazing, and shows RHCP at their best. It's a perfect mix of early and late Chili Peppers- still has some funk, but is mellowed down just enough. The early funk is pretty good, but is also kind of hard-core. Two thirds of the songs in the later albums are pop. But Californication is golden.<br /><br />The entire album is definitely planned out very well- the ups and downs of the different songs is easy to follow. The first notes of Around the World set the standard for something crazily fun. After listening to the furiously funky Get on Top, you want something a little softer like the song Californication. Any other rock album would make you scream over the silence that follows the end of the music- something hard and heavy can't just die away abruptly. A lot of bands make the endings of their last songs go on forever, which is repetitively boring because it's just sound- rock sound that doesn't fade off properly. But Road Trippin' is a perfect way to end an album- it's a little softer and falls off into silence just right. Or onto another album...<br /><br />All of the music is incredibly solid. It never really seems to be either too busy or too simplistic. There is no unneccessary noise, and all of the instruments come together into something that sounds amazing- nobody consistantly outshines somebody else. But there is energy in the music- something that makes everything more alive and relatable. And that is what makes an album like Californication shine.
0385737955|2.0|After reading such glowing reviews and knowing the premise, I really wanted to like this book more.  Instead, I found it only . . . okay.  Not a horrible story at all, and one that I think could've been much better if the author hadn't spent so much time telling rather than showing.  Thomas spent far too much time doing the introspective bit to death; emotions were spelled out rather than being acted upon; and despite a knack for propelling the narrative with cliffhangers at the end of every chapter, the author then dragged the action down by constantly explaining and over-explaining the same scenarios over and over again.  The premise is imaginative, although painfully obvious by the middle of the book (hello, WICKED, anyone?) and would've been better served by not indulging in so much exposition.  I suppose tweens might enjoy this book.  (Although the cutesy vernacular was wearing; we all KNOW what the kids are saying.  Are we supposed to swallow that the same kids who say things like \\"awesome\\" and \\"dude\\" don't have swear words in their vocabulary?  Please.  Either curse, or be done with it.)  Older readers will be bored and hard-pressed to resist \\"shucking\\" this to one side.
B002GOAH1U|5.0|The DVD came right on time, was in excellent condition, and I would purchase from this seller again.
B003VSVWA0|2.0|Even in his twilight years Leonard Cohen and his songs are exceptional.  This DVD had to be returned because it did not play without interruption of sound and picture in some places.  I do not know if this was peculiar to the DVD I received or if all the production was flawed.  I would check this out when you receive it.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|It's not a \\"game\\" so Amazon needs to fix that category, but anyway this thing is GREAT.  I forgot how responsive a brand new Gamecube controller can be, because the last time I had one was circa 2001...  One of my Wavebirds broke, and I had to replace it to continue playing Smash Bros with friends.  The packaging is in Japanese, but it really doesn't matter.  They apparently don't carry GCN controllers at Toys R Us anymore, or even the Nintendo World store, so I grabbed one here. The wire is extra long, so it's kinda sorta like being wireless?....  I guess the fact that I don't have to keep putting batteries in it balances everything out.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|These are the right artist, with the right songs, for the right time.  This CD is bigger than John Legend, and bigger than the Roots.  This music transcends the moment, this is what R&B wanted to be when it grew up - in an era where none of the songs on this CD have any commercial appeal it is an amazing product.  I am glad it was made for me to enjoy.  After you play this CD you may as well turn off the radio and sit in silence cause no song made in this generation is worthy of following any track.  This is what music use to be like.  It use to mean something, it use to make you feel something and artist were once musicians.  When you buy this CD a little of the artist soul comes with it.  This CD was not made to sell records, it was made because it had to be.
B002VWNICW|1.0|If you like a melodramatic romance with beautiful scenery, you'll enjoy this. It is Pride and Prejudice done the way the Bronte sisters would have written it. But as a tribute to Jane Austen's ironic masterpiece, it falls far short. How a true Austen fan can enjoy this movie is beyond me. Lizzy is a silly, giggly schoolgirl, and Keira Knightly is badly miscast. So is Matthew MacFadyen, whose Mr. Darcy is more sad and shy than arrogant and conflicted.   Major characters and events are cut down to a mere nothing, leaving the story completely undeveloped. Mrs. Bennet is a shadow of the hysterical, nagging matron from the book, while Lizzy is an overwrought, forward young woman who behaves completely outside the boundaries of propriety. Austen would be horrified.  There are plenty of historical and literary anomalies for those who know their history and literature. It actually makes me angry and physically ill when I watch it. If you want to see Pride and Prejudice as it was meant to be, watch Andrew Davies' brilliant 1995 miniseries. It is the only proper way to view this story.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Much as I am for rewarding an author for his work, this price is an attempt at gouging by the publisher. Say no to this price!
B003TVMIDO|5.0|First off, let's be clear about what is in this box and what isn't.    The box includes the Lennon solo albums \\"Plastic Ono Band\\", \\"Imagine\\", \\"Mind Games\\", \\"Walls and Bridges\\", and \\"Rock and Roll\\" -- all of his officially-released solo albums.    It also includes the John and Yoko albums \\"Some Time in New York City\\", \\"Double Fantasy\\", and \\"Milk and Honey\\".    For a bonus, it also includes a rather short (six songs) disc of John and John/Yoko singles, which includes the songs \\"Power to the People\\", \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\", \\"Instant Karma!\\", \\"Cold Turkey\\", \\"Move Over Ms. L\\", and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\"; and a second bonus disc of John's home demo tapes, mostly devoted to songs that appeared the \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\" albums.    It does NOT include any of the following:    - The experimental John and Yoko albums \\"Two Virgins\\", \\"Life with the Lions\\", and \\"The Wedding Album\\"  - The album \\"Live Peace in Toronto\\" (John and Yoko with the Plastic Ono Band)  - The new remix of \\"Double Fantasy\\"  - Other non-album tracks that have been included on previous CD versions of the albums, such as \\"Do the Oz\\"    Each album is in a cardboard double sleeve in the style of old LP packaging. Original front and back cover artwork is used in all cases, and has been reproduced very well. Each album has a gatefold photo of John (sometimes with Yoko) from roughly the same time period as the album itself. Each album also comes with a small CD booklet that discusses the album and its songs. Complete lyrics are included in each of these booklets.    The CD sound is excellent, and I approve of the decision to return to John's original mixes rather than the posthumous remixes that have been used on the most recent CD releases prior to this. These CDs give us the music as John intended it to be heard.    The packaging is very much in John and Yoko's style: very simple and elemental, mostly in white and blue. The box is surprisingly large and includes a fair amount of dead space; this results in a nearly perfect cube shape, and provides enough room for a small hardcover book entitled \\"Yes\\" that discusses John's life, a separate piece of folded cardstock with individual messages from Yoko, John's son Julian, and John and Yoko's son Sean, and the package's last bonus, a small drawing by John enclosed in a hardback cover. I don't know if every box has the same picture, or if there are different ones. Mine is a peaceful drawing called \\"Family Tree\\" showing a couple resting underneath a tree, much as John and Yoko do on the covers of the two \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" albums. Like much of John's artwork, it is expressive and elegant, the product of a natural and largely unschooled talent. His ability to convey an image with a minimal number of lines reminds me of some Japanese art.    All in all, I am happy with the box and I recommend it. It's a fine companion to the recent Beatles box sets, and in some ways it feels more artistically assembled, no doubt due to Yoko's personal involvement.
B000P0J0B0|5.0|Great movie, great price, arrived 2 days after purchase. Came in excellent condition. Very satisfied :)
B001992NW4|5.0|WOW...this is what a great...GREAT blu ray issue should be.  This two disc set features much to enjoy. Both the original theatrical version and extended versions are here and look ..well ridiculously good, better than they ever did and the note included from Director William Friedkin speaks to that work. The NEW bonus features are really truly the mother lode...containing not only new interviews with the main contributors in front of and behind the camera but loads of exciting behind the scenes footage showing just how all these incredible effects and make up etc were achieved. This is housed in a classy book with great photos and bios and all for about $25 ...I would say that THIS is a prime example of a 5 star movie and a 5 star DVD/Blu Ray presentation. OH...and they DID carry over the excellent British documentary and bonus interviews from the 25th anniversary edition....too  many blu rays are dropping the existing supplements and I am very happy to say if you buy this set you will be able to get rid of BOTH the previous editions.<br /><br />This was a landmark film and this is a definitive and spectacular presentation!!!  As a purchaser of thousands of DVDs and Blu Rays I can say this is in the top 10 for all categories from content, quality ,  packaging and price.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I had been waiting for this cd for a while. It's only downfall is that it's short, but that not always a bad thing. Not really any fillers and it just keeps you wanting more. Not too many artists can achieve that these days. Simply put this cd is a must have and I hope he doesn't take too long to release a follow up cd.    Bottom line - If you enjoy music...of any genre you should pick this up.
B00461AIXI|2.0|Using a hook singer to push a single is nothing new in the hip hop genre, some time the results are successful, such  as the classic Ghostface Killah & Carl Thomas song Never Be The Same of disastrous  the Lloyd Banks & Musiq Soulchild track Addicted from Bank's second album . Last spring  rising hip hop artist  B.O.B. had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B., Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire. On the heels of a possible jail sentence, we now have Bruno Mars debut album. Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot.   1. Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally. Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ. *** out of ****  2. Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop. I'm a grown man so this song didn't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good. *** out of ****  3. Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD. The arrangement reminds me of something that Robin Thicke would do. **** out of ****.  4. Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song, I knew I wouldn't like it. Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999. * out of ****.  5. The Lazy Song - Listening to this track, I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc. Just as the title implies this is a lazy song. ** out of ****.  6. Marry You - I'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence. *** out of ****  7. Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time. I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away froma loved one.  8. Liquor Store Blues (Feat. Damian Marley) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it. *** out of ****.  9. Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be. If he doesn't go to jail and with a great band backing him, this song will sound great live. ****  10. The Other Side (Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o.B) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing. *** out of ****     Overall this isn't a horrible debut album, it is a mediocre album.  I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R&B album with top notch production, instead he's given us a Jason Marz sounding album.  Bruno has a naturally smooth falsetto voice and while he couldn't handle to other falsetto's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant, the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps. Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he didn't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg's.
0634023020|2.0|The arrangements are more of an acoustic interpretation for a classical guitarist rather than chord melody arrangement for jazz guitar.  Indeed, the author plays an acoustic on the CD, not an electric archtop as pictured on the cover.<br /><br />The song selection doesn't help either.  Nefertiti, for example.  Great song when the second quintet plays is, but it is slow and meandering and not suited for solo guitar.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Bridge of Sighs has never left my turntable, eight track, cassette, CD, MP3 since it's release. This album stands alone as the ultimate blues rock guitar heaven of all time. Every track simply melts. This album is the masterpiece of testosterone-driven, alpha male energy the makes your blood boil. When the lyrics and guitar licks don't drive you into a frenzy \\"Day Of The Eagle\\" Too Rolling Stoned\\"  \\" Little Bit Of Sympathy\\" then the slow bluesy soulful melodies of \\"In this Place\\" and \\"About to Begin\\" are like an arm-full of Heroin without the downside. James Dewar is the most under appreciated vocalists of the century and he, like Robin are SO LONG OVERDUE FOR THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME. It is impossible to think that a singer could have the power to stand up to and equal Robin's timeless guitar but Dewar pulls it off.  This is a must own album and its remaster absolutely shines. The extra tracks are an extra slice of cheese cake. A Must Own to any serious rock aristocrats collection.
B0041VV03A|5.0|I read the review's and everyone naturally has their own opinions. Personally , I found this movie held me spellbound. It was very different from any I've seen before. Tampering with nature is a very, very dangerous game.  I really hope that there will be a \\" Splice 2 \\" .  Great movie....
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Avatar changed my life and it will change yours. I shows a beautiful world  in which the life forms are interconnected in a magical way. It shows a reverance for the natural world that we humans need to acquire and practice if the Earth is going to be habitable by our childrens' children.
1840220554|2.0|There are not many books I finish that I regret reading but I'm sorry I read through a version of Jane Austin's complete novels. I always preferred \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to \\"Emma\\" (although Clueless did a lot for Emma) but Austen's other heroines leave a lot to be desired and the claustrophobic atmosphere of society and poverty close in around one. I much preferred my less realistic view of her characters when I'd read \\"Pride\\" and abandoned \\"Emma\\".
B003NWS5AO|2.0|Was not impressed with this cd. I liked his previous effort with A Krausse, but this was rather lame.
B002JVWQSW|4.0|I have only seen a few episodes of Modern Family before watching this box set of Season 1. It is a comedy show about a family and somehow watching them makes my family's craziness not so bad!  First off I knew I would like this show because it stars Ed O'Neill who was the famous \\"Al Bundy\\" in Married With...Children.  He plays the dad and step-dad of the show and is married to a much younger woman!  All the characters though are crazy and funny and make me laugh, which after a long day of taking care of my own kids I need a few laughs!  There is so much going on that it is hard to get bored and hard not to laugh!  I love that it is multi-racial and the characters are different so the show does stand out as a comedy.  There is adoption, a step child, a gay son, and something for everyone.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|Last season Glee was on right after American Idol and that was also the time that I was leaving my moms house to go home to get the kids in bed.  I always missed the ends of the episodes but the parts I did see were funny!  I loved checking out the new \\"Glee: The Complete Season 1\\" because I got to watch the episodes in their entirety and relive moments I really liked.  Now I will say I do not typically like musicals but this show makes it seem natural and the cast is great!  Every episode had my smiling and enjoying the singing and dancing.  The music in Glee covers most genres and really has something for everyone.  The show also features celebrities like Kristin Chenoweth, Josh Groban, Molly Shannon, Eve, and Olivia Newton-John.  It is like the movie \\"Grease\\" but an entire show!  So even if you don't like singing or musicals, I recommend giving this popular show a chance.  The characters are all so different but work together and the show is also full of dating, fighting, great dialogue.  Even though this show is set in a high school with teenagers, do not think it is a typical teen show, it is so much more!  Oh and who could not like Jane Lynch as Sue the competitive cheerleader coach.
B003UYV08E|1.0|Is there anybody but me out there that found this movie utterly ridiculous?  Downey brings good acting and character, both ecentric and charming, which is about the only good thing I have to say about this nonsense.  Did anybody on the crew that made this movie actually read any of the original Iron Man comics? Did anybody read the stories, the history, the character background, etc?  Apparently not, because aside from taking the names from the original comic, nothing about the movie matches.  In this movie, Stark makes it clearly known that he is Iron Man, while in the comic series, he went to incredible lengths to prevent just that; not the least reason of which is that it would cause many of the same problems played for gags in this film. The movie is mostly action, of the type that appeals mostly to adolescent boys, where there is a lot of shooting and blowing up and crashing, together with a heavy dose of sexy women clad in skin tight outfits.  If anyone is interested in a plot, the nearest thing they come to is that Stark's iron man suit is stolen and copied. In the original comic series, it was very clearly stated that Stark had taken all kinds of precautions to prevent just that.  All recorded plans, all copies of the iron man suit, had multiple mistakes and booby traps built in to prevent anyone but Stark from making a working copy of the iron suit. So even if something was stolen, it would not do the thieves any good. Any copies made would malfuction in a variety of ways, or even blow up.  I kept waiting for such fail safe booby traps to be triggered as the military played with the iron man suit, but apparently the Tony Stark in this movie was not as brilliant as the one in the comic.  Apparently it never occured to him that someone would try to steal his work, and that he needed to take steps, not only to prevent the theft, but to render the stolen items useless to the thieves.   And Whiplash, who is the arch villian in this movie----laughable.  He appears, heavily armed to be sure, but also with his entire head, neck and upper torso naked and exposed.  Any cop, any security guard, with a gun and a good aim could have put a bullet between his eyes and ended the entire episode.  And shall we mention the betrayal of Stark's best friend, Rourke? What else do you call it when Rourke, never once trying to really find out what was wrong with his friend, marches in, orders Stark around, then beats him half to death, destroys his house, steals his life's work and completely betrays any idea of friendship.  The fact that he had \\"orders\\" was a piss-poor reason, in anyone's book.  And I cannot imagine Stark's attitude of \\"forgive and forget\\" at the end of the movie.  And Rourke gets an award at the end of the movie? For what? Betrayal of a dying friend, playing into the hands of a dangerous villian, stealing a friend's life's work, violating several dozen laws and endangering civilians, or generally being an ass?  And anybody who thinks that this movie's portrayal of Nick Fury of Shield is in any way accurate, did not read the same comics I did. And did everybody catch the finding of Thor's hammer lying in the desert after the final credits?  A set up for the coming Thor movie, one in which the makers probably did not read any of the Thor comics either.  If you are a young teenager, you will find Iron Man II entertaining. If you are not, don't waste your time or money.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Nice headset, can't really complain except it's a little tight so you might have to take them off after an hour or two of wearing them. Haven't really been able to use the mic much so I can't say much about it except it doesn't extend in front of your mouth or even to the side, it sits a little more than halfway between the headset and your mouth. Over all though, it's a good headset and I'd recommend it unless you have a large head or want a mic that extends to your mouth
B0041VV03A|1.0|I don't understand who can think this movie was good, or even not horrible. In just one night 2 scientists are able to create a new life form (easier then making a cake), They sneak it out of the high security bio lab (in a cardboard box).Then they have sex with it. Yes a real horror classic.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I can't put into words the incredible-ness of this series. I have watched it over and over again and keep finding things I missed in previous viewings. The quality of acting is wonderful. I can't recommend this highly enough!
6305511055|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I tried to buy it from Borders, but they didn't have it in stock.  I was very happy to be able to get it at Amazon.com.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Stallone has made three great movies in a row.  It started with Rocky 6, then Rambo, and now the Expendables!  The acting is bad and the story line we've heard before, but when you have such a stellar cast and a lot of action it really makes for a fun flim.  Knowing this movie is designed solely on action makes it very enjoyable!  A movie for guys who like movies!
0316019984|5.0|A bargain at twice the cost, you must buy this book immediately.<br /><br />Six main pop-ups involving multiple mechanisms lunge outward, forward and upward from the pages. I do believe this is the fattest pop-up book in all the history of pop-up books. These are augmented by 22 additional pop-ups, if I counted them correctly,  that fill up the otherwise unused spaces of the main entries.  Each minor inset pop-up could easily stand on its own and rate its own separate page. I do love it when those auxiliary pages themselves have auxiliaries that are very easily overlooked on the first pass. Pretty tricky there, Reinhart! This book is truly a  tour de force in this fascinating entertaining craft.<br /><br />I only just now noticed a battery compartment in the back cover with a protective pull tab. I will not tell you what the batteries are for. That would ruin the fun.<br /><br />I am a bit jealous of the imagination, creativity, and talent expressed here. Even the smaller pop-ups are not insignificant and the &eacute;clat on display here gives an aspirant something to aim for.<br /><br />Thank you, Matthew, for this wonderful book. You are a treasure.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|Well, this film was too close to the Karate Kid 1984 version. Most agree that this film was touched up here and there to retell this David and Goliath story. As Mr. Smith says, \\"The story idea had still some meat on that bone.\\"  For me, the film was ok. Views of agressive Communism aside, I have a hard time with the Chinese being the bully types though. Sure, there are losers just in China as in the USA, but in China, public instiutions do not support them.  The culture in China is really not supportive of that type of behavior. In fact, you could have gone to the school and reported these the kids. If the teacher was backing them up, a simple visit to your friendly neighborhood Communist Community Tatle Tale would have resulted in the teacher loosing his job or even sent elsewhere, Why? Every one has enemies who are willing to take you down a few pegs, Commrade.  Maybe the instructor would have been arrested and ended up being placed in the People's Republic Rice Pluckers Group 44-721-Q until the dragons come home. Community malcontents are not looked upon as Good Ol Commrades and so would not be supported by the People's Kung Fu school. Good Rep. is big time importance to them. One little tale escaping to the right ears, say the Pig Dog Western BBC who would broad cast this little fact, and it would be WHOLE KUNG FU SCHOOL SENT TO THE WEST OF CHINA To Gather Cammel Doo Doo for twentyfive years... Film at eleven.    The Cobra Kai types of the 1980 movie makes sense as Americans can be un aware enough to use Karte or some martial art to beat others up and even follow a teacher who is supportive of that type of behavior. I had a Karte teacher who believed his Shotakan Karate Dojo was actually a form of FIGHT CLUB. We were to go to bars and start fights to test how real our Karate was.  Whatever.   Anyway, regarding China, don't beleive me? Try this...Learn some sort of Martial art. Go to the People's Republic of China.  Start a school and randomly attack people, specially be on the look out for foriegn kids who have an overly protective mother who works for some Mega King Company that hires people from out side of the Middle Kingdom (very rare by the way) and see what occurs. Oh, if you do, say \\"Hello\\" To the Western People's Republic of Bat Guano Gatherers for me.  Anyway, ok film in the long run. I may even buy the DVD because there is nothing else to watch on tv these days. Flesh eatting zombies can get boring after a while.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I remember after the first Iron Man was released, the sequel's date was almost immediately annouced, and director complained that such shortening the time in which they had to do the sequel would make it impossible to do as good a movie.  Something obviously changed his mind, and he made a great, and very entertaining movie, just shy of the greatness of the first.  The thing that keeps Iron Man 2 bogged down from classic is too many plots.  In this movie there's a plot about Tony Stark dying, Whiplash Seeking revenge, Justin Hammer trying to out do Tony Stark, the Army wanting access to the Iron Man technology, Tony's dad issues, Tony and Pepper's relationship, and more avengers subplots.  It's not necessarily a bad thing to have a complicated movie, but many of the stories feel a little rushed, and weighed down by all the others.  However, getting past the many plots there is a plethora of reason to be entertained.  The action was pretty great, from the battle on the race track to final showdown.  The special effects are good as ever, and Robert Downey jr. really makes the character of tony stark shine in a way that he never did in the comic books, both by being likeable, as well as having depth.  I very much enjoyed this movie, and am very happy to have it in my collection. Recomended.
044654759X|4.0|In \\"Safe Haven\\" by Nicholas Sparks the main character is Katie--a twenty-something who has run away to a North Carolina town, in a bid to hide from her past life. Enter Alex: a widowed store-owner with two kids, who begins growing infatuated with Katie after her visits to his store. The first half of the book follows their budding relationship, as well as Katie's friendship with her neighbor Jo.    However, mid-plot, the thriller begins. We find out that Katie has a psycho husband, a police detective called Kevin who's obsessed with finding her and exacting revenge--not only on Katie but also on the man she's with. The book then alternates between Katie and Kevin, and their separate plot lines.     Prior to reading this book, I read that it has actually been optioned off as a Hollywood movie which is gonna begin shooting soon. The strongpoint of the book--the reason why it was probably optioned, besides the high-profile of the author--is the well-developed conflict. There's a sympathetic main character who's trying to start her life anew, and a villain bent on destroying her. I heard that this book was most similar to Sparks' previous title \\"The Guardian,\\" which I haven't read yet but look forward to starting. Overall, a good read.
B001FB5634|5.0|1.  This is one of those films where one can clearly understand how some may like the film and others may not.<br />2.  Yes, it's another one of the post civilization type of films (ie everything is drab, desolate, depressing;  ie kind of like the Book of Eli etc...).  And yes, it's kind of slow and perhaps dry, but the acting is excellent and the story is deep and important.  All in all, watching the movie is like going on a long and semi-boring hike, but in the end, it's very worthwhile.
B000VVTHSO|3.0|The record was in pretty good condition, but the cover was torn as hell at the top.  And the lyrics werent included.  So, I'd have sold this as \\"good\\" condition.  I was bummed
B002VECM4A|5.0|1.  This is one of those movies where the hype actually matches the reality of the film.<br />2.  The writing / acting... basically everything is top notch.  I watched this film at least a month ago, but I still think of the film, the acting, the story;  ie it is truly a work of art.  Highly recommended for everyone, except kids etc...
073937771X|5.0|This whole 3 book series was awesome , Lisbeth Salander is one tuff chick. Each book gets better & better, and you get instantly hooked. A great read all the way to the end. You think your family is messed up? \\"Well maybe they are!\\"  but your gonna like it alot. I wish Stegg was still around, now I have to find somthing as good.
0061733199|5.0|This book is awesome.  If you are looking for a good,practical survival guide with easy to understand directions and pictures, you need this book.  It covers everything, from how to survive outside in all climates to creative ways to get rescued.  The descriptions of how to build shelter, ways to collect water, et cetera are explained in detail and accompanied by good illustrations.  I really enjoyed this book.  iT'S One of the BEST survival manuals I have ever read!
B003Y8YXEO|4.0|So, for John Lennon's 70th birthday (10/9/40) there's a bunch of remastered releases being...released. Among the new discs is this one, another hits collection. The music here gets 6 stars obviously, but the only plus to this package over others is the remastering. The old John Lennon Collection has more songs, as does Lennon Legend, and of course the 2-disc Working Class Hero has over twice as much. They all sound great to me. Mostly here what I miss is Beautiful Boy, Mother, and Nobody Told Me. There's no reason this couldn't have been a good 18-20 tracks. There is a version of this that comes with a DVD of videos if you need those. Happy birthday John...you're missed.

B0036TGSR6|1.0|I have been disappointed by the endings of many movies, felt cheated/betrayed or insulted by some, and been irritated that the filmmaker wasted my time. However, I cannot remember ever being as infuriated by an ending as this one.  There were five elements in that ending that each would have themselves constituted a ridiculous or otherwise bad ending.<br /><br />WARNING: Some of the comments on this review contain spoilers--additional absurdities that I omitted or danced around here.<br /><br />The cinematography and atmospherics are very good (with caveats), as one would expect from this director (Polanski), and if I had known to shutdown my brain and not try to follow the story, I probably would have enjoyed the first half to two-thirds of the movie.  However, the story is one long stream of ridiculous contrivances and contradictions, all the way from the core plot elements (examples below) down to the minor details. It feels like the author/scriptwriter (Harris) took the template of the suspense thriller and shoved a grab-bag of standard elements from the genre into the slots without bothering to make them even moderately compatible, much less a coherent story.  I am not talking about the normal contrivances that power the typical suspense thriller or even the over-the-top contrivances that provide the energy to ones like The Da Vinci Code.  I am talking ones that are unnecessary, lazy/stupid and blatant (\\"In your face\\").<br /><br />The scriptwriter even fails to provide consistency between adjacent sentences in a scene. The replacement ghost writer played by Ewan McGregor (henceforth GW2) is attempting to set up a meeting and is concerned about his telephone call being monitored by the bad guys.  The other party tells him to be vague about his location, he agrees and then gives not just the name of his hotel, but his room number (even though they aren't meeting at his room).<br /><br />A number of these plugged-in elements are blatant anachronisms.  Having a few such is acceptable, but their number and avoidability add to the sense that the scriptwriter wasn't really trying. For example, when leaving one house, GW2 is told to not turn in the wrong direction or he could become fatally lost. This is said menacingly, but comes off as silly: GW2 is driving a luxury SUV--in which GPS has long been standard--and the audience is well aware of the GPS because GW2 had depended on it to get to the house, plus the product placement includes the SUV's computer reminding the driver of this fact every time he gets in.<br /><br />If you are familiar with New England, some of the atmospherics may be spoiled because the sense-of-place is wrong.  The primary locale is a beach house on an unnamed large island (think Martha's Vineyard) in winter, and the weather is primarily high overcast, lacking the dynamic aspects and extremes that I remember. And when GW2 visits a person's house \\"in Boston\\", that house is in a thinly populated, thickly forested rural/wilderness area where you can drive for miles without seeing another vehicle.  My recollections of Boston are quite different: that leaving a gap of more than half a car's length was an open invitation for another car to pull in front of you.  Also, the scenes involving the ferry are decidedly and jarringly non-American.<br /><br />The atmospherics of the beach house, although artistically interesting, don't support the suspense thriller story.  It provides a sense of isolation, but one that you seek out rather than endure, and that is expansive rather than claustrophobic.<br /><br />In its promising start, the movie _touches_ on--but fails to develop--a number of themes that could have been interesting in a suspense thriller not centered on a murder and this category of The Big Secret.<br /><br />Additional caveats: Although I think Tony Blair has much to answer for, this movie is an unfair, unpleasant hatchet job.  And it is permeated with the anti-Americanism of the European left.<br /><br/>DVD Extras: Comments by scriptwriter, primary actors, director. Short, mundane, laudatory, totally predictable.  Comment by scriptwriter: \\"the rules of the thriller drama are almost like grand opera ... are very strict and formal, twists and turns of plot, and I like that\\"<br /><br />Examples avoiding significant spoilers<br />--------------------------------------<br />The first ghost writer (henceforth GW1) discovers The Secret and saves it as a Hidden Message anticipating that he might be killed, which happens during his return from a trip to see someone.  However, since he already knows The Secret: (1) he does not need to talk to that person, (2) he should know that there is negligible chance that that person would confirm The Secret (directly or indirectly), and (3) that asking questions of that person that revealed that he knew The Secret would put him in danger. Since the connection to that person was part of the public record--some of it quite prominent--if GW1 decided he needed confirmation of those facts, he could easily have interviewed that person as a legitimate and innocuous part of his role as a ghost writer without raising suspicion that he knew The Secret. Further confounding the \\"logic\\" is that that person wasn't home when GW1 went there, hence there was no trigger for GW1 being killed at that time.  The scriptwriter uses this nonsensical trip as a mechanism to have GW2 become aware that that person is significant.<br /><br />The essential clue to The Secret was readily--and implausibly--available on the Internet and in a form that would have already invited countless people to follow up to at least the same point as GW1 and GW2.  Part of the \\"foul aftertaste\\" of this movie is that there never is any actual evidence of The Secret, only a couple of minor coincidences that could easily have been meaningless, and likely dismissed as such. As such, The Secret would better be labeled The Flimsy Conspiratorial Conjecture.<br /><br />The Hidden Message is illogical.  GW1 had to know that if he was killed it would likely have been destroyed in the normal course of events before becoming available to the public (which in fact it was). And even if it survived, GW1's clue for finding it was too fragile and arcane.  And if anyone did find The Hidden Message, what good would it do?  It gave no usable information and had zero credibility, being indistinguishable from a random occurrence.<br /><br />The hardcopy manuscript is effectively a main character in this movie (acknowledged in the DVD Extras), and is a major implausible contrivance.  Rather than use the electronic version, GW2's rewrite is to be done on the hardcopy which is then to be typed back in (appears to be about 1500 pages).  This is howling nonsense because the book is on a tight deadline--GW2 is given only 2 weeks to do a major rewrite--and this not only reduces his productivity, but introduces multiple cycles of delays (the typing-in itself and then finding and correcting all the typos).  The conceit that this arrangement is to prevent leaks is punctured when GW2 simply walks out of the house with it, no questions asked.<br /><br />When the scriptwriter got to the slot in the template that called for a \\"bad guy\\" to lie to the main character, apparently he didn't understand that it was important what the lies were.  For example, the scriptwriter has that \\"bad guy\\" utter a series of lies that are themselves implausible and pointless, and ridiculous from the viewpoint of the \\"bad guy\\". In one of these, when the \\"bad guy\\" is asked where he was several weekends ago, he implausibly claims not to remember, but then _immediately_ negates his obstructionist lie by asking his wife who immediately looks it up.  He was the keynote speaker at an international conference in Aspen, not one of those inconsequential things that one immediately forgets.  Moreover, lying was against his interest: That event gave him a rock-solid alibi that was easily confirmed/refuted.<br /><br />Example: GW2 is an incidental witness to a crime seen by hundreds, including police and TV camera crews.  The perpetrator is unambiguous and is killed.  Case closed? No.  Although all of GW2's relevant information was learned watching a local TV news broadcast, the police take away his passport, explaining that he is their \\"key witness\\".  Since this particular plot element went out of style with the fall of the Soviet empire, perhaps the scriptwriter found it at a really good clearance sale at The Hack Shack (\\"The Writer's One-Stop Source for Recycled Materials\\") and just couldn't resist padding the script with it.<br /><br />-- Douglas B.

0439023483|5.0|Don't hesitate to read the \\"Hunger Games\\" series....exciting and fast-moving! This series would make great movies.  The characters have a lot of dignity and have great human qualities.  Put in the element of survival and you have a great reading adventure ahead of you!
B003G8W0GA|5.0|Big fan of Baker all the way up through Tennent. I wasn't sure Smith could cut it, but he does a good job. I didn't like Tennent at first; or rather, not as much as Ecl. Smith strikes me the same way, but I'm sure he will grow on me as Tennent did.
0439023513|5.0|Loved the characters' names and their personalities.  The \\"Hunger Games\\" series is a great read.
B000002KXO|5.0|I also bought this for my daughter-in-law's birthday.  She said this was something she has wanted to have for years.  She is absolutely blown away!
B0024FAR5W|5.0|This is an excellent tv show. The real deal,kind of like The Sopranos as bikers. However they're not on the bikes that much,which makes the great actors stand out. I highly recommend this series.
B003Y8YXH6|2.0|The two star rating is kind of unfair, but I'm sticking to it. These are some of Lennon's best songs, and that is saying a lot. Of course, Yoko kept his manhood in her purse, so she was able to intrude and plaster herself all over this album. Had John left her off and included some of his songs from Milk and Honey, this would easily have been a 5 star album for me. The stripped down version is what it is. I thought the songs were great how they were, but it's interesting to hear different versions much like the Beatles Anthology was interesting for the same reason. Do I drive around in my car listening to the Beatles Anthology? No. It's only nice to have for the historical value. Same with this. It's interesting, but not necessary and I'll probably only listen to it on occasion. More than anything, I see this as a way for Yoko to make some extra money by re-releasing something \\"new\\". But 7 tracks of Yoko's horrible voice forced into my ears on both discs is not worth it. I'll just download the John songs and have a nice little EP, thank you very much. If Yoko wanted to do JOHN'S fans right, she would take herself off this album, take her self off of Milk and Honey, and put all the John songs from both albums together on one disc. Now, that's something I would buy.
B003JSSPSY|1.0|More like the Legendary Disappointment.  The books were great, I wish the script writers had followed them a little more closely and I'm not sure who cast \\"Richard\\" but EPIC FAIL to them.
B002M9WW30|5.0|It has been great revisiting this box set.  We are now enjoying it with our 2 children and it is a exciting for them as is was and is for us.  It is a great family movie as it follows Rocky and his family over their lives.  I would highly recommend this movie set.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception was hyped s a riddle. That it is not, or only for the feeble minded. It is a fast paced scifi move about a bunch of people who can enter our dreams and manipulate us in these dreams to reveal our secrets.   In order to gain entry to the US where he is searched for murder, Cobb, the protagonist, agrees to plant, via a dream, an idea in someones brain. In order to fool the target, this has to be done via a dream wthin an dream (within a dream).  I do not want to go further into the intricate story.  What convinces are the visuals and the need to be constantly alert to be able to follow the plot.  The visuals are spectacular, luminous colors rarely seen, vivid sepia tones (before that was for me a contradiction in terms), a dreamlike crispness of every image, alternating with the soft 'out of focus' of old silver plate photos.  The plot, though not challenging, requires the viewer to remain alert and not to miss anything. Unlike Nolan's previous effort 'Memento', here the plot has a more natural flow. 'Memento' s a fascinating but highly artificial construct, while 'Inception', though naturally totally artificial, seems to be less construed.  All in all, a movie worth seeing not only once but even twice. A movie not to be seen because of character development or depth but rather for the stunning and emotionally gripping visuals as well as for the well constructed plot.
0307454541|5.0|I received the book 5 days after having ordered it in an excellent condition. Great service.
0399536108|3.0|I was expecting for the content to be really unconventional and radical.  Instead, it seemed like more of the same.  Not much more value than what's out there on the blogosphere.  I also grew tired of hearing over and over about his time in Africa.    Still gets 3 stars for being overall good advice and well-written.
0812550706|5.0|This is the best scifi I have read since Asimov and Clarke novels, period. It is not unpredictable, but smart enough, clear, and it truly has a scifi spirit. A novel feels a bit rushed, because it is packed with action. Could be used as a basis for like 5 movies. A must read for anyone that loves great scifi.
B000OVLBGC|3.0|A most frustating cinematic experience; I wanted to   feel engaged but felt decidedly detached and mostly   disinterested with the principles. A shame, because   the story-line was excellent (recalling 'The Conversation)   but the execution was not believable.   Too cliched for me; hackneyed and mostly contrived.
B003TVMIDO|3.0|I wouldn't say that I regret buying the box set, but I certainly don't appreciate it. For $150 you don't get [[ASIN:B003Y8YXEY Power To The People: The Hits]] (the DVD part anyway) or [[ASIN:B003Y8YXH6 Double Fantasy Stripped Down [New Mix + Original Recording Remastered]]], which are available only separately. The entire product lineup for the remasters seems to have been concocted just to confuse shoppers.     If the lack of new mixes and including a DVD were shunned to keep the box to only \\"canon albums\\", I regret to inform Yoko, etc. that albums are missing from the remastered list. Live in Toronto. Live in NYC. Menlove Avenue. Wedding Album. Two Virgins. It's a shame, really a lost opportunity.    I see only two reasons to get this set. I hope they help you decide if they're worth $150 to you.    1) Lennon's rarely seen collages are sprinkled throughout the rather lovely book that comes in the box. I've only ever seen these in the book from the big Lennon show at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, and this book contains ones not in the Rock Hall book. There's a few photos I've never seen before either, including a nice one from 1966.    2) The Home Tapes CD featuring Dakota tapes and outtakes. To bootleg collectors, songs like India and One of the Boys are nothing new, but I believe these are unheard takes. The version of I Don't Want to Be A Soldier I Don't Want to Die is completely different and new to my ears.    The box also comes with a code to enter a John Lennon online universe, which I haven't entered yet but don't expect much but minimalist clouds from. The sound so far is good, but nothing earth shattering.     Guess I have to pick up Double Fantasy Stripped Down tomorrow. :(
B0013NBBOW|5.0|I've always been a fan of Steve Hillage, with and without his accomplices at Gong. And by collaborating with Hatfield & the North's Dave Stewart you get the best of both worlds. They are in a way like Lennon and McCartney in that they complement each other well even if their stylistic approaches vary greatly. Stewart's signature 70% rock, 30% fusion keys thankfully avoid using classic jazz or fusion chords, only the themes. Lots of changes in each piece, and more rewarding with every listen. An obscure gem not to be missed by prog fans, particularly those enamored with prog's Canterbury Scene.
0783229372|4.0|Having George C. Scott as a Nazi was a kick for me.  Since this was made not long after PATTON it was fun to see Scott switch sides in this one.  Certainly a good cast with many famous actors from yesturday.  Ann Bancroft seems like she is re-tooling her role as Mrs.  Robinson a little here!  The atmosphere of pre-war transatlantic flight via Hindenberg is compelling. Certainly we get lots of great shots of the airship in mid-flight.  This was the luxury Jumbo Jet of its day for sure.  The reliance on such fragile technology for trans-atlantic flight seems amazing today, but this was the signature item of its time for Germany.  More for propaganda than realistic use, the film conveys well the intent the Nazi's had for this purpose.  Special effects may pale in comparison to now, and the premise of the Hindenberg's fate certainly is spectualtive, but the film does a nice job showing the period and the great air-ship.  Some good characters and a fairly tense plot keep the itnerest.  The Hindenberg crash of 1937 could well be regarded as the 9/11 of its time as the shock value was equally great. The speculation that sabotage was responsible for its demise is a great degree of license taken by the director.  Still, the supposed sacrefice of the terrorist on board who wants to destroy the ship in order to make a statement against Nazism raises questions about terrorism today.  What is the distinction between legitimate resistance and an act of terror.  The movie brings such issues to fore in a timely fashion.
B00004TXFX|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my husband just hoping that it would play.  We tried it on a Blu-ray player and it didn't work, but we had an old school $20 DVD player from about 5 or 6 years ago and it played like a pro!  The DVD was awesome and I was so glad we still had that old DVD player.
B003UYV08E|4.0|This was more like a behind the scenes in the life of an action hero where we got to see the high and low points of the main character. In revealing the issues being experienced both by the heroes and villains the definition of a super hero becomes altered. Instead of a perfect being with super powers fighting the bad guys we see a man with problems like everyone else but one using a special gift to fight the forces of evil. As a result there is a little less action but just as much fun.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Equilibrium is not very original, but it's a fine synthesis of the novels 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451.  Cinematically, the look is highly influenced by Metropolis, and the fight scenes are reminiscent of The Matrix.     Okay, now that I've established \\"Equilibrium\\" is highly derivative of other influences, I give it high marks because it's a well-told, well-acted tale of trying to break free from total mind control in a dystopian future. Christian Bale does a great job as an enforcer of the \\"no feeling\\" rules; and when he begins to feel emotions himself, he convincingly plays a man experiencing feelings for the first time in his life. Emily Watson and Taye Diggs turn in fine performances as well, and also, as the \\"big man in charge\\", the actor that plays Robert the Bruce in Braveheart does quite well.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|An explosive tale about betrayal, The Losers is more than just mindless blowing up of targets but something more. It becomes an abandoned team of US special taskforce trying to return home and staying alive at the same time. Clearly the big issue is trust or the lack thereof. Each character adds his/her brand of humor, wit and chaos to make this an action film worth watching.
0670034711|5.0|I found it refreshing. Period. I do not understand why people criticize it so much. But maybe it is because they were expecting the book to answer all their questions about themselves? The author sometimes seems self absorbed, so what? She is allowed since she is writing about her OWN experience!  I laughed on some parts, wanted to go on on others because they touched a nerve or simply because I didn't identify with it, but mostly I enjoyed it and even recommended my son to go to De Michele in Naples to eat what seems to be the best pizza in the world. See? I even got good tips on this book.   I often wonder why people sit down and criticize so harshly, is it because they can do it better? If not, I would strongly recommend to check what they are about to buy before they do, because this book said it was about a woman's search along with the title Eat, Pray and Love. I thought it was self explanatory.  Elizabeth is someone you can relate to because she worries about the mundane, she is down to earth. I get tired of reading about characters that are super everything. This was a good change for me and I really recommend it.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|I've been enjoying this album all summer. However, I don't think it's a 2010 album by a band from Australia called Tame Imapala. No, this album sounds like twelve lost tracks from 1971 in which Led Zeppelin temporarily fired Robert Plant and hired George Harrison to sing and write lyrics. It rocks, it's trippy, it's haunting. Dare I say, beautiful? It stays with you. I like all of the songs, but my favorite might be \\"Lucidity,\\" where no one told the drummer he didn't have to hit the skins like it was the end of the world. Frankly, I'm sick of American indie bands that don't let their drummers do anything other than keep 4/4 time. Tame Impala is from Australia, so they kick out the jams without embarrassment (a la Wolf Mother). They even do (gasp!) an instrumental. Tame Impala's playful abandon might not make them as cool as Wilco, but it makes them a lot more exciting. There's a lost track, \\"Track 12\\" that deserves radio play, even though it won't get it. My one criticism is that this album isn't as polished or well produced as it could be. But, neither was Live at Leeds. These guys have made their mark. I can't wait to hear what they do next.

B002JVWR9U|4.0|Can't believe I've become addicted to this show...describe it to someone & they look sideways at you. But it is a great escape from the \\"human\\" dramas & nightmares of everyday life...the only caution I have for the DVD itself is that the deleted scenes option next to certain episodes are not matched up correctly. Example, if you select the cut scenes from episode one, you will see deleted scenes from episode two...which can be a spoiler if you haven't actually seen episode two. Other than that glitch, sit back and enjoy the teenage angst of a vampire & human offset with deliciously entertaining interference from a diabolical yet endearing vampire brother. And you thought your family had issues?
B0034G4OVS|4.0|I was skeptical.  It seemed like the typical teenage horror story.  Three college friends, two of whom are romantically involved, try to scam a cheaper ride up the slopes for some skiing/snowboarding.  Then they are chased by a slasher in a goalie mask, blood gushes, sex ensues...  Well, none of that happens.  What a pleasant surprise.  Frozen is a bit of a cautionary tale about having a little respect for, and perhaps fear of, the power of nature.<br /><br />As I referenced above, the three friends scam their way onto a lift for one last run on a Sunday night, right before the slopes close for a week.  A storm is coming, and everyone wants out.  Due to some very believable circumstances, the ski lift is shut down with them on it, and everyone leaves, for a week!  They are left with trying to figure a way down (it looks like about 50 feet or maybe more) and then a way out before dying of hypothermia.  They face many natural hazards (I don't want to give anything away), but best of all, no man-made or supernatural enemies.  This is purely believable, and that adds to the terror.<br /><br />In all, this is a minimalist, one set piece with a very small cast.  The performances are very good, if not spectacular.  The gore is kept to a minimum, and the R-rating is largely for language.<br /><br />While this doens't have the supernatural element of the Ruins, and certainly less gore than the Ruins, I think that Frozen will likely appeal to viewers who enjoyed the Ruins.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I have been an enthusiastic support of the Kindle and have bought more books in the past 2 years then ever before but the current pricing which is now being set by the publishers shows how greedy and stupid they are!  Everyone should vote with their wallet and do not buy these ridiculously priced books. Do they think we are stupid! The publishers printing costs are minimized and this is sheer greed.   The sooner authors by pass these publishers the better.   And for those who say this should not be about price, you are wrong because authors like Follett condone this.    I will not be buying this book or any more of Folletts until the publishers reduce their prices
B00127RAJY|5.0|I exercised for years,tried lots of different dvds and gyms and never saw the kind of results I got with a few months of Jillian's workouts.  Definitely try this workout and when you're ready to take it to the next level after this awesome set of workouts, consider The Biggest Winner series.  I've never gotten so much from a 20 minute workout as I have with hers.
B000EU1PKA|3.0|No where near as strong as the Kai Hanson real Helloween but this is actually not to bad of an album, kind of 50/50.  It's half good songs and half experimental bad songs with great vocals.  Better than anything with andi derris anyway.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I can't say enough about this series...I LOVE it!  I am a huge Huge Laurie and Stephen Fry fan anyway, so this is a true delight.  Trusty Jeeves always has a plan and manages to come out on top of even the most difficult situations.  My only regret is that it finally had to end.  This is family friendly - my kids even love it and it just goes to show that entertainment doesn't have to include violence.  This is true British Comedy at its best.
B000GG4XD8|5.0|This is amazing and Gamma Ray still brings the goods to this day.  This is a classic release in every sence.  If you love this album check out Gamma Ray which is Kai Hansons other band and leave HElloween II line up alone, it sounds nothing like this great album.
B003EYVXUK|5.0|\\"Let Me In\\" seems to take some of the 'glamour' out of vampirism when compared to the stylistic bloodsucking movies of late, i.e. the \\"Twighlight\\" series.  I won't go into a lot of detail so I don't act as spoiler, but I'll just say that if vampires walked the earth, I think they would live a life more similar to the fanged-teeth characters in this movie.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original movie this film is based upon, so I can't make a comparison between the two; I just know I thought this film was very good overall.  Recent newcomers Chloë Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee did a nice job in the two lead roles, while Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas added credibility to the casting in strong supporting nods.<br /><br />The plot in this movie involves Smit-McPhee's character, Owen, being targeted by school bullies and subsequently befriending his new neighbor, Moretz's character, Abby.  Abby helps Owen see that he can't let himself be bullied to no end, but rather needs to stand up for himself if he wants to get enjoyment out of life.  As Abby and Owen's friendship grows, Owen does begin to defend himself against his thug peers, and Abby provides extra support when needed.  Their friendship also spawns unique situations that also lie at the heart of the movie's theme.<br /><br />Bottom line: \\"Let Me In\\" combines an interesting story with high-level acting to create a unique movie within the vampire realm.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Being a die-hard TOS fan, I found the movie to be mildly diverting.  However AQ & PQ are so outstanding that it almost made up for the rather over-the-top Nero characterization that, had it been played straight, might have actually brought the movie up a couple of notches.  Fun to watch, even if the storyline is confused and illogical (sic)- and Simon Pegg as Scotty is pure delight.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Can't go wrong with Robert Plant!  Band of Joy is awesome.  The music throughout the CD is varied and interesting. Not a bad song on there.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|Very good transfer.  Overall, a vast improvement in PQ and AQ over the dvd release.  It did appear to me that the picture was brighter than the previous releases, but it doesn't detract too much from the movie.  I dialed in the brightness and contrast to replicate the murkiness of the dvd release and went from there.
B001EN71CW|5.0|To those who havent seen the series firefly, or the film Serenity you are in for an absolute treat. I'm very jealous I wish I could see \\"New\\" episodes but maybe in due time. Do yourself a favor and if you're into sci-fi, action, whitty, great writing, this series has one of the best casts, and yes Nathan Fillion is our captain, no one else!
B003MZ0I84|5.0|In this day and age, radio is overoccupied with pop music whether it be from Lady Gaga or Auto-tuned R&B singers. Not many pop bands are left to bring new and fresh music. I am a fan of Maroon 5's music and I loved their previous 2 albums. I was a little skepticle about this album however; their single \\"Misery\\" was not as catchy as previous songs they have made in the past and even though it is a good song, I just felt it wasn't up to par with their previous work. I had no idea their album came out up until a few days ago so I decided to buy it. I didn't know what exactly to expect with this album but I can say I don't regret buying. The songs are beautifully written and the melodys of each song have a different sound to them. But, yet again my only complaint I have with this album is that it isn't as catchy as their previous work, it takes a while to really soak in; it took me about 3 good listens to fall in love with every track. None of the songs grasp you right away and honestly some of them are not that memorable. But If I had to rate this album as a whole I would still give it 5 stars because I really do appreciate the quality of music Maroon 5 brings to the table. It is pretty refreshing to hear their music again and I recommend this album to all music lovers, its fun and just great music in general. Truly one of the best albums of 2010 thus far.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:<br />1) Don't Know Nothing<br />2) Runaway<br />3) Misery<br />4) Never Gonna Leave This Bed<br />5) Just A Feeling<br />6) I Can't Lie

B003Y8YXEO|4.0|Hard to believe this year will mark the 30th anniversary of when the world lost one of the deepest artists in pop music, John Lennon. During his reign with The Beatles, he helped make so many delightful classics like Yellow Submarine, and Twist & Shout. But on his own, he made some of the most dominant and strong staples in music, that've continued to touch the way the world has shown through his eyes with love. He had his trials, from the possibility from being deported from the U.S., from being a sign of abolishment, after saying that The Beatles were more popular than Jesus in the 60's. But through it all, and even after the day he was sadly murdered, John Lennon has been one of the most influential artists of all time. Now, a new hits collection shows what made John Lennon so popular, and why his songs are still staples of our lives.<br /><br />Power To The People: The Hits, is the latest hits album, from John Lennon. The collection, is a simple re-introduction to John's classic solo songs, that seperated him from his Beatles work, and made him a icon. The songs have all been remastered, and show a new beginning for John's impassionate voice. Most of John's classic standards and staples are here including his definitive Imagine, the intimate Whatever Gets You Through The Night (with Elton John whom backed Lennon up on the song back in 1974,) his classic cover of Stand By Me, and tracks from his final record Double Fantasy like Watching The Wheels and the somber Woman. The collection of songs remain a constant that've kept Lennon's legacy more than alive, but there were a few songs that honestly were overshadowed from the album like the deep & dark Working Class Hero and Nobody Told Me to just name a few.<br /><br />Despite a few overshadowed songs, Power To The People: The Hits remains a mostly solid hits collection that showcased what made John Lennon a real one of a kind. While it isn't as strong as John's past greatest hits records like Working Class Hero from 2005 or Lennon Legend released back in 1997, it is still a strong re-introduction to why John Lennon was so special. It honestly is never going to be possible to celebrate what would've been his 70th birthday, without grieveing the sadness of the day he was murdered so brutally 30 years ago. I honestly have to say I was born on the 4 month anniversary the day he died, and truthfully I've never known a singer whom was so brutally honest about his life, and his legacy. John Lennon was that one in a million, and he will always be missed.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: BLegend released back in 1997, it is still a strong re-introduction to why John Lennon was so special.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I first saw the World at War series in the '70's (on PBS) when it first came out.   I loved it then and when I saw it on Amazon, sent it to all three of my children's families. Great historical documentory.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|I've been a Mahler fan ever since my brother-in-law gave me a 9th symphony score.  I copied the 15 s oboe solo 10 minutes into the 9th on my computers so I get \\"Mahler on the hour\\".  The recording of the \\"song of the wayfarer\\" in the box has a baritone singing the German - MUCH better than the Seattle Symphony's presentation with a soprano.

B00079FUI6|5.0|Missed out on the hoopla when it started, but managed to see the first of the first on TV and I decided I had to get the set. Very happy with my purchase, and the delivery and the quality. This is the first set I own of a TV series, and probably won't be my last. I would buy from this seller again. Very nicely packaged, it was heat sealed so it seems brand new (I thought I had bought used). And so far so good, it all works like it should. Very happy.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|I got this disc as a birthday present and had not known anything about this group. When i first played it my first thoughts were that it is ok , then as the songs kept playing i realized that i was starting to like it more. By the end of the CD i was very happen to received the disc as a present. Over all the CD reminded me of the band called Badlands from the 80's by Jake E Lee . If you like that type of sound you should enjoy this disc!
B000002L80|5.0|what a GREAT cd! So many wonderful songs on this album it truely is classic! There isnt a song that i skip to on it because ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT! two thumbs up!  and this is coming from a girl whos 22! Great Album
0307454541|4.0|What a great fun, albeit macabre, read `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is. Don't be fooled by the hype machine that presents this novel to be anything more than it really is: a chilling procedural mystery yarn in the best traditions of the genre. Sure, it takes awhile to get going and some adjusting to the staccato and clumsy translation may take some pages to adjust to, but once complete, you'll whip through the 600 pages with eager ease.<br /><br />I won't describe the plot here, as so many reviewers do, often with spoilers. If you like mysteries, you'll enjoy this book, plain and simple. This isn't a literary book though, as some may mislead you into expecting. You could read this book on the beach, in a hot-tub, or pretty much anywhere on vacation. But this won't go on the bookshelf next to Catch 22 or Murakami or anything. On the other hand, one could probably successfully make a case for Lisbeth Salander as one of the more, if not most, unique of mystery novel protagonists. She has the unique distinction of being both the hero and a victim (in many ways) as well as a mostly unlikeable and extremely troubled mess of the best and worst humanity has to offer. The one star reviewers out there really should probably lighten up a little. If you think mystery novels are inherently bad and a waste of time, this one won't be any different. If you enjoy a fast read with a few different spins on the genre and don't mind reading names with a few extra consonants and locations that don't correspond with a current CSI tv show, you'll probably rate this as high or higher than the average guy/gal. I'll be reading the next one soon. Enjoy.
0399536108|5.0|I need to start this review by telling you a bit about me. I'm an Editor and a novelist so, already, Chris's ideas appeal to me. I'm already the black sheep in my family and hope to take my unconventional life all the way (meaning: someday I hope my unconventional life will completely support me). This book is about hope and inspiration. This will be one of the very few places where we're told in this world that we can do what we want, that we can be happy, that we do not have to live our lives trying not to make waves. This book is the reminder of that thing I think we all know: This is our life and we have the right to take responsibility for it and do what we want. There is one very bad review here that I see. I'm surprised there isn't more because of my own experiences. Jealousy and fear drive people against projects like this. Every time I've said that my plan is to not to have children I've received at least one angry look. For some reason people think I'm talking about them somehow even though I've made it clear that I'm just talking about me and what I want to do. The immediate response is, \\"Well, isn't my life good enough for you? You need to grow up!\\" Chris makes it very clear in his book that he is happy for anyone who is happy. He uses his own life as an example of how he managed to change his circumstances so he could eventually be doing what he wanted. This man and this book are an inspiration.
B003UERZ88|5.0|On the 3rd listen it clicked. This album cointains awesome guitar work and is very well produced.   Halford is awesome as expected.   The Metal God hit us out of nowhere with this great record.  All bow down!
0375842209|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I was not sure I would ever get through it. Why? Well, why would anyone want to read a book that is narrated by death! The format was also a little difficult for me at first. The author would add little pieces of information right in the middle of the chapter in a completely different format and sometimes the information did not even pertain to what was being discussed in the chapter. Whatever was the author thinking!     The book is set in Nazi Germany during World War II. The main character is a little girl named Liesel Meminger who is sent by her mother to live with foster parents. Leisel soon settles in to her new life, even making a few friends and growing to care about the couple that has taken her in. The book gets really interesting when Max, a jew, comes to live in their home. I will give no more details as I don't want to give anything away!     As I worked my way through the book, I quickly realized that death made perfect sense as the narrator. After all, the book is set in Nazi Germany when death was a constant for anyone that was not German or part of the Nazi regime. Even Germans were constantly looking over their shoulders wondering if they would soon do something that would cause their untimely death. And, as death points out, the deaths occurring were senseless and hard for many to understand, including death himself.     The author takes a different approach in explaining what was happening in Germany during the time of the Nazi regime. I think it is a great idea to describe the years through the eyes of death as well as from the perspective of a child.     Although I was skeptical at first, I quickly grew to love the book and could not wait to pick it up every night to see what trouble Rudy and Liesel would find themselves in next. The book is not a happy, feel good book, although it does have its moments, but I don't think you can expect that from a book set in WWII. It is a book that makes you think aboutlife and how precious every life is, no matter the color or creed.
B003DT19F0|5.0|The best one yet.  My 2 Five year olds like it and have wanted to watch it every night for over a week.  Get it now.
B002ZG99CM|1.0|Pathetic remake to say the least. The original was a classic and appealed to both adults and kids even to this day..this is more of a kid's flick, which is disappointing because most of the original Karate Kid's fans are adults now. If Will Smith wasn't the kid's daddy I'm sure they would have found a BETTER and OLDER actor to play the part and it may have salvaged this remake.     Guess it's a good children's movie, but that's about it.    \\"The Karate Kid\\" should actually be titled \\"The Kung Fu Kid\\"...but they obviously wanted to piggy back on the original's success.    If you're a fan of the original, don't waste your time.    FAIL
0316044695|5.0|True account and a eye opener of what our troops go through.Hats off to all that have served and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.Everyone should read this book.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|I love horses, especially thoroughbreds, and Secretariat, whose nickname was \\"Big Red\\" was one of the very best.  This film does him justice.  Diane Lane, who portrays the owner of the horse and the stables, does an exquisite job in her role as gutsy stable owner and extraordinarily classy woman.  John Malkovich is perfect as Big Red's trainer, a very savvy misfit who finally gets his chance to find glory in the shape of a horse.  Now that I've seen the movie I can't imagine any other actors in those roles.  The photography of the races, including the closeups of the back end of a horse's hind legs and hooves filling the screen and throwing dirt at full speed, is amazing.  I knew Secretariat's story already, and I wondered if it was worth going to see a movie that just recounted that story over again, but wow! was it ever worth it.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|Initially I heard nothing but negative comments and saw negative reviews about this movie and did not want to see it. What a mistake that would have been!! The new film stays true to the original story and stands out on its own when compared to the original \\"KK\\". The Pat Morita, Ralph Machio became a classic and set a standard for the story - however, it was neither the best acted nor action choreographed picture of all time. Of course the studios milked the franchise for another three pictures afterwards (don't forget the last KK was female) and all the movies after KK1 were very predictable and pretty much sucked. Jaden Smith gives a far superior performance to Ralph M. and Jackie Chan shows a surprising amount of actual acting talent because he is not fighting his way through the picture. Jaden Smith does a good job in his portrayal of Dre and physically at 11years old, he is miles above RM. (sorry Ralph...) The film does have some slow spots but what film doesn't maybe \\"Crank 1 & 2\\" but this is a film with a story and there the film really shows it's stuff. If you liked the original, fine but don't knock this picture because it a remake of your childhood coming of age flick. Rent it, enjoy it then buy it.
1401324029|4.0|After the success of Heat Wave, the first tie-in novel to ABC's hit mystery/police procedural/comedy Castle (yeah, it even made the New York Times' Bestsellers List), ABC is continuing the adventures of Detective Nicki Heat and reporter Jameson Rook in Naked Heat. Not only does it have an already built-in fan base, but the entire show serves as essentially \\"free\\" advertising. Even better, in the Castle episode that aired the day before the book came out (the typically Monday time slot), the writers threw in a casual conversation between characters where they just happened to mentioned that Castle's new book is \\"coming out tomorrow -the actual release date of Naked Heat.    In Naked Heat, reporter Jameson Rook's juicy piece on Nicki Heat has just hit stands. Though his summer ride-along is over, Jameson is eager to get back on Detective Heat's case. Though Heat would rather avoid her former lover, and the emotional baggage that comes with him, she crosses paths with Jameson while investigating the murder of famous New York gossip columnist Cassidy Towne. As the mystery unfolds, the relationship between Jameson and Nicki heats up.    Much better than Heat Wave, Naked Heat reads like an expanded episode of the show, except that Nicki is a romanticized version of Beckett that is probably drawn from Castle's fantasies about the detective. Even though one of the show's writers probably didn't ghost write this book, the characters' dialog is dead on. I could even hear Castle and Beckett talking in my head. The cast of suspects feels like something out of an episode of the show and while the mystery is somewhat predictable, its obviously drawn from the show.    Though its not great literature (more in the vein of James Patterson), Naked Heat is a fun mystery that's great for Castle fans.
0061537969|5.0|I picked this book up on vacation so I'd have something to read on the 6-hour plane ride. Little did I know that I would hardly be able to put it down after the plane landed.     Any pet owner worth their salt talks to their pets, asking for silent advice, confiding secrets, and even asking for their patience through tough times. Just as certainly, we all think we are a little nuts for doing it. As I read this book, I heard my own voice talking to my Lab over the roller-coaster 7 1/2 year relationship we've shared. He's been the dog of my 40's, and he's seen me through some painful and wonderful days.    The author does a remarkable job of helping me to justify my private conversations with my dog. He relates that some believe that dogs who live good lives are simply readying themselves for their next level of existence--coming back as a human. While I love that sentiment, I can't help it think that perhaps WE are the ones awaiting our next level of existence, coming back as dogs. Enzo, the \\"star\\" of the book, guides his owner, Denny, through an incredibly difficult series of life challenges, suffering the curse of his lack of a voice and thumbs. As witness to many of these events, Enzo offers his unique perspective on the human condition, and his own.    This book is a wonderful read. It leaves you open and even a bit raw with emotion, but still smiling. It has a spot on my bookcase forever.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|I liked the album, but was disapointed....There simply aren't any songs on this set that I would consider  \\"favorites,\\" kind of like \\"Raising Sand.\\" Whatever happened to Robert Plant at sensational tunes???? Also, I miss new songs that were great, like from FATE OF NATIONS (1993), where he was making statements of great relevance, like related to the world situation (\\"Network News\\" and \\"Great Spirit Come\\") and also great love songs (\\"Come Into My Life\\"), and to reminisce with (\\"29 Palms\\").....With his two newest CDs, I'm at a loss.......

1932907009|2.0|This book is inexpensive, so who wouldn't want to try it? Screenwriting is generally the highest paid writing work out there (unless you're JK Rowling). The problem is this: if all it takes is $15, a few weeks of reading, and a little practice, almost everyone can be selling fabulous screenplays and quitting their day jobs. If this were true, most Hollywood movies would be great because nearly every movie would start with a fantastic screenplay.    Lots of reviews here are positive, but I haven't seen one let alone many declare, \\"Hey, I just made half a million dollars on a screenplay, and all I needed was this book!\\" If you ever see that, don't believe it unless the review provides a title for the screenplay, so you can look up the sale.    Screenwriting is a good target for this sort of book because it's easy to think that screenwriting can be learned easily. In fact, it's a highly skilled profession (well, the good writers are highly skilled). No one's trying to sell a book: Save the Atom - How to Become a World Class Nuclear Physicist in 6 Months. Or, Save the Aorta: 13 Easy Steps to Becoming a Heart Surgeon. We know these professions require one to learn a huge and detailed body of knowledge, a body that takes years to learn.    Drama writing is similar. So, the question is I think this: what is the body of knowledge for drama writing, and where does one find it?
030726999X|5.0|There is an upside and a downside to this being the last book in the Lisbeth Salander series. Right now I am going through Lisbeth withdraw. I loved each of these books and it makes me so sad to know there are no more stories about my new hero. On the other hand, if this were a ten book series, there is a good chance I would not have risen from my couch until December. I could not put these books down once I got started and lost quite a bit of sleep until I was finished!

0374158460|3.0|I found this book inferior to The Corrections. While well written with a good shift in narrative voices, I found it hard to care about the main characters, whose travails seemed mostly self-inflicted.
B00005JKGK|4.0|Really enjoyed the book, you've gotta watch this movie. I consider this as a classic that speaks to nearly every Asian American woman. There are some who say that it negatively portrays Asian men. I guess it could be interpreted that way but this story is really about the women! I always have to get some tissue ready for this movie. Only thing that bugs me about this movie is that Ming-Na Wen looks sleepy throughout the entire story...
0399536108|5.0|I'm glad Guillebeau did a print version of what he's been up to on the web.  Finding his material via that medium was pivotal at a time when I was just starting to wake up and suspect there was more authentic and inspiring things to be doing in my life.  Hopefully this book spurs on others who are suspecting the same.    It's a fun quick read.  It is not a laundry list of what to do, but more a catalyst to get you thinking about possibilities.
0739352687|5.0|My son has a problem with reading and understanding what he read.  If it is read to him, while he follows along with the book, he can tell you anything you want to know.  He loves the Percy Jackson stories.
076790382X|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book, as I had read some of his previous work and thought them entertaining and even witty.  For whatever the reason, this book never rises to that level.  He takes a more aloof tone and is relentless in making fun of everything and everyone he encounters.  I have to be completely honest, that I did not actually finish the book.  I grew weary of his insults and negative humor.  I took offense at his continual belittle of small towns and the people that live there.    Hopefully he is now past that period of his life and is back to lighter and less mean spirited observations of others.
B003ZJJFKE|3.0|It's an OK effort, but not what you come to expect from the guitar legend. I'm a little surprised at the high review ratings thus far. Then again, Satriani's fiasco with Chickenfoot currently holds a rating of  \\"4\\". Go figure. Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards stylisticly is all over the map and lacks continuity.  At times it sounds overly bluesy and other times sounds overly Jazzy. The album lacks emotion and comes across as somewhat boring. The two standout tracks are \\"Golden Room\\" and Wormhole \\"Wizards\\".
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I'm always trying to get my husband to turn off the TV and play board games, but all we have around here is Monopoly and Sequence.  I picked this up and we've been loving it.  Even he likes it!  I thought it would take longer to play, but we got done in about an hour.  The game is a bit confusing to start out with, but as you play through, you pick it up.  Lots of fun!

B0034G4P7G|4.0|In the last scene of The Social Network, an attractive attorney who is working on Mark Zuckerberg's case, has to turn down an offer to go grab something to eat with him and he is left sitting alone in an office conference room.  He's the lonely young billionaire.<br /><br />I find Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, and the main character in The Social Network, to be a fascinating fellow--at least as he's played in the movie.  He doesn't always come across as likeable in the movie, but he is always interesting.  Zuckerberg is one of those people who is absolutely brilliant and yet he is socially awkward.  It might even be fair to describe him as, socially, somewhat unaware.<br /><br />Most of us have known someone who was frighteningly smart in terms of basic intelligence and yet the person didn't know how to get along very well with other people.  Right?  It's the person with the genius IQ who has trouble having an ordinary conversation involving small talk.  That's Zuckerberg.<br /><br />This is established in the very first scene of the movie.  In this scene, Zuckerberg and his girlfriend, Erica, are sitting in a bar on the campus of Harvard University and after he bothers, annoys, and, even, insults her, she tells us him that she is going to her dorm to study and that she is no longer his girlfriend.<br /><br />That's not a great way to end the evening.<br /><br />The scene unfolds with some snappy dialogue that involves Erica telling Mark that dating him is \\"exhausting\\" because, she says, \\"going out with you is like dating a Stairmaster.\\"<br /><br />Their exchange ends with Erica delivering this zinger: \\"Listen, you're going to be successful and rich.  But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek.  And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true.  It'll be because you're an... #x@*&!\\"<br /><br />This movie was interesting to me because of the Mark Zuckerberg character, in addition to that, the creation of Facebook is an interesting story.  In fact, the whole phenomenon of Facebook is fascinating to me.  Why do certain things catch on?  Facebook started at Harvard University and initially was opened selectively to various other universities.  At every university where it was made available thousands of students signed up within days.  Why is that the case?<br /><br />Social networks already existed prior to Facebook, it was not a new concept.  Even the exclusivity of Facebook, which is highlighted in the movie as an important ingredient to its success, wasn't a new concept.  So, why did it catch on so effectively and ultimately bypass other social networks, like MySpace, which had a great head start?<br /><br />[If you know the answers to those questions, by the way, you might be \\"billionaire\\" material.]<br /><br />I found the story of Facebook to be told in a compelling way in The Social Network.  And, believe me, it's amazing that I've used the word \\"compelling\\" about a movie that does not contain a single explosion.  In fact, at no time during the movie was the word \\"kung fu\\" ever mentioned, and I still liked it.  Maybe I'm growing up, huh?  [Oh wait...what was I thinking?  That can't be it.]<br /><br />Ultimately, though, there was a sort of sad irony to the movie.  Mark creates the world's most successful online social networking site allowing millions of people to be connected and, yet, he winds up being sued by the friends that he makes along the way, including his best friend.<br /><br />At the end of the movie some follow-up type of information about several characters was provided in text on the screen.  The last bit of this follow-up information stated that Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire.  And we're reminded that a person can be very rich and still be lonely, in which case we have to wonder: Are you really rich?<br /><br />Dan Marler<br />Oak Lawn, ILting story.

B001RTCP1A|4.0|Where does one start with a movie they have watched on DVD many times. I suppose the thing that needs mentioning is the Fact the movie is the same but with a good sound system and BluRay playback you then get a fantastic and true experience of Pitch Black as was originally intended. As has happened with many movies in the past the experience at a theater is somewhat lost when ported to DVD and played on the old CRT TV with inbuilt sound. But now that it is on BluRay then you get to enjoy it immensely, crisp picture, the sometimes vague impressions that were there when dark scenes were happening in the DVD are corrected on the BluRay version. For fans of Pitch Black and the series if you can afford to buy the BluRay I would strongly recommend it. Why only 4 star - would have been nice in 7.1 sound.
B003L77TZI|4.0|If you're having a bad day this is the CD to listen to. I love all types of music, but normally not a big \\"pop\\" girl, but this CD is fun and funny. It also has a few songs that make you stop and think, maybe even cry like, Not like the movies, The one that got away,and Circle the drain. But there are plenty of fun songs too, you know the type of song you deny listening too, but secretly love, like Peacock. The CD is a fun way to get through tough moment in the day without getting over emotional.    So why only 4 stars, because the CD is missing that one song, you know that one song that makes you fall head over heals for an artist. But, the number of good songs on this CD almost makes up for that, so I would recommend this CD to every 16-26 year old girl out there.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I have purchased about 10 of these DVDs.  I love the product and bought them for friends and other family members.  The only thing I wanted to know before purchase was the ratings of the seller.

B003WSFXKY|1.0|I have to agree with all the negative reviews of this new Santana album.    I was at the presentation concert august 25th in Vegas and while Indie Arie's version on 'While my guitar gently weeps' left some goose bumps, the next song 'Photograph' left me speechless, with more disappointments to come.    I have seen Santana 5 times live since 1978 and even though I do not agree with all those folks, that don't like his music later than 1975, I have to agree, that this new CD is a total sellout and failure. There are 4 maybe 5 songs on this CD, that can be listened to more than once, but the majority is unbearable.  My personal list from the best song (IMHO) to the worsts:    01 Back in Black - very powerful and has a new twist, makes this old classic very modern.  02 Fortunate son - another powerful one, Creeds voice makes this a winner.  03 Can't you hear me knocking? - I liked the version live with Andy Vargas singing it; here also good.  04 Bang A Gong - I always likes this song since my young days, here performed in a pretty good way.  05 While my guitar gently weeps - a very nice new version of the old classic. With all the Radio and TV play, this one will end up soon as did Maria, Maria before > in the ' way too often heard to still like it' box.  06 - 14 all the rest, with 'Photograph' and 'Under the bridge' sharing the spot for the worst rendition of someone elses song.    But make no mistake : 'Whole lotta love', 'Smoke on the water' or 'Little wing' are not much better. Joe Cocker, where is your voice ? 'Dance the night away' doesn't really fit into 'GUITAR HEAVEN' does it ? It is a Van Halen disco/dance song, not a guitar heavy rock song.  If it had to be a Van Halen song with a well known guitar riff, how about 'You Really Got Me' ?    Anyways, for those of you considering to buy this album, get a couple of songs as a download and forget about the rest. You don't miss anything, except the embarrassment about where Carlos Santana went with this.

0385335997|3.0|I know all of the other reviewers loved Voyager, however, I found the book to be uninteresting and unappealing.  The first two novels in this series had depth and character in the events of history and the romace between Jamie and Claire.  Voyager left me feeling like....oh well, big whoop they got back together.  The story is disjointed and I found myself saying..okay...who cares.  I expected more and I was disappointed.
0385342047|2.0|Having read all the books in the series, and enjoyed the first couple immensely, I had hoped that some of the fun would remain in this latest book:  and it does - to a certain extent.   Becky's parents, her friends Tarkie & Suze are still fun to read, and the scenes with these characters in them are the most enjoyable part of the book.  But her husband Luke, seems to be more of a minor character in the story and the addition of their daughter Minnie, whilst interesting, they didn't seem to have much emotional connection.   Becky never seems that interested in her own child, and the mother/daughter scenarios just didn't happen.    A good chunk of the book is about Becky planning a surprise party for Luke, and all they lying and shopping got a bit tired in the end.  I wanted more than a book about a surprise party!        I still love Becky's shopping ways, but think for the next book in the series (and there will be judging how the ending is on this one), Kinsella may need to have more in the storyline than found in this one.

I can't complain about the price nor can I complain about the expedience of shipping, but the description was vage compared to what the case of the DVD looked like... there were several holes in the plastice surrounding the case and packaging left on from when the previous owner has puchased the DVD new. All around nice and can't complain.

B003Y8YXH6|4.0|I've never considered Double Fantasy (or Milk and Honey) to be among the Lennon's greatest work, but it was a nice record and sadly, the last. Not sure I'm motivated to shell out the bucks for this, but I may check it out as I found DF a bit over produced and the lack of production in a way helped M&H. As to the never-ending criticism of Yoko, love her or hate her, Lennon had a response for those of you who gush all over his work, say how great he is and then dump all over his wife.  It went something along the lines of `screw you brother/sister.' Since he's not here, I'll take the liberty of saying it for him. The more people belly-ache and complain about Yoko, the more sympathetic a figure she becomes and the smaller and pettier the complainers appear. I guess the fact that he dearly loved this woman, and she him, means nothing.  He's just a performing flea for your leasure time amusment, right?  How dare he have a life outside your fantasy world and have the audacity to involve it in his work.  If you can't take that reality, skip over the tracks you don't like, make a mix CD-R of just the John tracks and shut the hell up.  Those of us who can accept things as they were/are will just let the album play through as intended.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I originally acquired most of the Carpenters' Christmas music made its CD debut via [[ASIN:B003GMZSD8 The Compact Disc Collection]] that included a single Christmas CD compiled from both original Christmas albums. Although having a running time of almost 70 minutes, inevitably some music was missing, but while I was pleased to see both albums released in their full glory as a double CD, I was prepared to wait for that double CD to come down in price, given that I had most of the music already. Almost twenty years after I bought that boxed set, I finally saw this set offered by Amazon at an appealing price. The quality of the music is, of course, superb and illustrates the Carpenters' love of Christmas music.<br /><br />The first album, Christmas portrait, dates from 1978 but quite rightly includes their original song, Merry Christmas darling, which they recorded more than once; I'm not sure if the version here is the same one that became a hit single in Britain, America and elsewhere, but it really doesn't matter to me. The remainder of this album mainly comprises familiar songs (albeit some more familiar than others), sometimes performed in full and sometimes strung together in medleys, with a nice selection of carols and festive songs. Santa Claus is coming to town, previously a hit single for them, was definitely re-recorded for this album.<br /><br />The second album, An old-fashioned Christmas, of which the title track is an original song, is similar in style to the first album in mixing carols, festive songs, medleys and full length songs. Here, you can find the original hit single version of Santa Claus is coming to town. Having included plenty of obvious songs in the first album, they still found plenty more for this album, but there are a few less obvious selections here too. The three Christmas classics most closely associated with Gene Autry are presented here as a medley (Here comes Santa Claus, Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer); in the earlier boxed set, Good King Wenceslas was tacked on to the end of that medley, but it appears here as a full-length song.<br /><br />Overall, this is a brilliant Christmas collection that I would have happily paid full price for years ago if I didn't already own most of the tracks via that boxed set. If you enjoy listening to both the Carpenters and Christmas music, you'll find that this collection sounds exactly as you would expect.et, Good King Wenceslas was tacked on to the end of that medley, but it appears here as a full-length song.

0385342047|2.0|I love Sophie Kinsella.  And I love the Shopaholic books.  But this one - eh, not so much.      First of all, in spite of the title, it's not really about Becky's relationship with Minnie.  Their relationship comes across as very superficial.  Minnie is a brat and Becky is an enabler.  We never really see the two of them interact in any way that doesn't involve conflict or shopping.  Even a shopper like Becky must spend a few quiet moments with her child.      I also find it very frustrating that Becky never really seems to grow or mature as a person.  Her attempt to justify (even to herself) the pocket money for Minnie scheme doesn't even seem authentic.  What kind of reasoning, functioning adult would ever think that was a good idea?  Kinsella also fails to write any authenticity into Becky's desire for another child.  It really does seem like she just wants one so she can buy baby stuff again and have another living doll to dress.  I think that Kinsella was trying to hint that Becky didn't want Minnie to grow up an only child as she had, but it's never very clear.      What I found most frustrating (and even downright ridiculous) was the whole \\"We're moving in two days!!\\" thing that Becky pulled on her parents.  Seriously - if I had a friend in real life who made up such idiotic lies, I'd suggest she needs a good therapist.  I don't know how Luke puts up with her!  Hasn't Becky learned anything from the other, oh I don't know, 10 times or so she has made up some insane tall tale?  I wanted to yell - JUST TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN GO RENT A HOUSE!  AND IF YOUR MOM DOESN'T LIKE IT THEN TELL HER TOO BAD!!!!!!It's just frustrating to see a very likable character make the same mistakes over and over again.  It's also almost insulting to the reader because it makes the plot so paper-thin and predictable.      There were parts of the book that I did really enjoy.  I thought Becky's secret shopping service was hilarious!  That's where the real Becky shines through.  And I also liked the role Elinor played in the book.     If Ms. Kinsella writes another Shopaholic book, I'm sure I'll read it.  But I hope she'll add some depth and maturity to Becky. Just a little...
B002ZG98CS|4.0|with the exception of one part i thought the movie was awesome. i was raised Catholic which explains why at one point of the movie i almost walked out. the part i refer to is when Machete's brother Padre meets his fate in the cathedral. other than that i loved it. alot of action and humor. not for kids though. should be rated NC-17 because of the extremely graphic violence.
B003TML0VO|1.0|I love cover albums and I love guitar Santana's playing.  This album should be a no brainer right?  But he somehow managed to ruin every one of these mostly great songs.   EVERY vocal was mediocre at best. Even guys like Joe Cocker mailed it in.     His guitar playing was uninspiring and uninteresting.   He took none of these songs in any new direction nor do they sound as good as the originals.  Think I'll go and listen to his first album.

044024367X|3.0|I love the Jack Reacher books.  Not all of them are \\"great,\\" but I know each one is going to be a \\"good read.\\"  There are a lot of knee-jerk reviews here which are trashing this book because a) Reacher admits to being an atheist (duh, did the pragmatic Reacher ever seem like a guy who'd have an imaginary friend?) and b) Reacher dares to question whether the Iraq war was fought for the right reasons (again, duh, we've always known that Reacher was capable of his own independent thoughts).  It seems that reviewers who are offended by the depiction of the crazy End Times cult have conveniently failed to notice that Child also included a \\"good\\" preacher as contrast:  the intelligent and kind-hearted preacher who helps Reacher when he's stranded on the side of the road.  And the reviewers who are offended by Reacher's supposedly anti-war views have conveniently failed to notice that Reacher never said ALL wars were bad -- just ones that are fought for the wrong reasons, and in his opinion (he IS allowed to have informed opinions and independent thoughts, I hope?), the Iraq War is not a good war.  Not everyone is going to agree with his thoughts on that subject, but how embarrassingly closed-minded would a reader have to be, to put down a book just because its protagonist has a thought or opinion the reader doesn't agree with?  Apparently some of the Amazon reviewers are very closed-minded indeed!    The reason I gave the book a middling rating is entirely due to its ending.  I won't give away any spoilers, but I thought the book ended so abruptly I actually went back and re-read the climax to see if I had accidently skipped something.  While it's fine to \\"cut to the chase\\" in an action/thriller, I'd rather a writer didn't \\"cut to the denouement\\" during the climax!  Oh, well, there was still a lot of good mystery in this book, and quite a few suspenseful and nail-biting scenes.  I probably would have given this book three and a half stars if such a rating were permitted.Maybe four stars, if it were by a different writer.  Child's biggest problem is that he's set the bar so high, with so many strong books, that it's hard for every single one to live up to fans' expectations.

B00402FGEE|5.0|I'm sure I don't speak for anyone other then myself, but I think SG:U is far better then any of the previous Stargate incarnations. Excepting the original movie of course.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I must be insane and I have no taste.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong I enjoyed SG1, and I even watched a few episodes of SG:A, but I just never really could get into them. I watched SG1 when it first came out on Showtime, horrible nudity and all, and I realized then that it was a fun show to watch occasionally but not something I'd be unable to miss. So over the last few years I'd watch it from time to time, enjoy it, forget it, and that was that. By the time SG:A came out I just had missed to much background and didn't really care to start over with it.<br /><br />Then along came SG:U and all of that changed. Suddenly cheesy lines and campy sci-fi takes a back seat and characterization comes to the front. We have a whole cast of characters that in the first few episodes felt more real to me then any of the characters from the prior series. I find myself far more drawn in by the darker themes and more mature and gritty scenerios and I really hope they can keep it up and not end up changing it to be more light and funny to appease those people that just want another SG series like the others. There is nothing wrong with that of course, I just like the show as is.<br /><br />Plenty of people have already summarized the basic story and plot elements so I won't bore you by stating it all once again, but suffice it to say it's a darker grown up version of stargate. Though I still think it could be darker and more mature, but once again thats just me.<br /><br />Some people have said it's like voyager, or uses the same old story from all the older sci-fi like lost in space, but really it does go off on it's own. Plus, so what if it does share some standard sci-fi themes? They are themes for a reason and I for one enjoy the scenerio regardless of how \\"fresh\\" it is. I've never seen battle star galactica so I can't really comment on if they are similar or not, but once again if you like the show what does it matter?<br /><br />Well, Thats all I've got. Love it or hate it, but personally I think it's awesome.<br /><br />Give it a try and maybe you'll enjoy it too...ally comment on if they are similar or not, but once again if you like the show what does it matter?

B000Q6GUW0|1.0|I'm not in to TV really, but there are decent shows out there. To name a few Rescue Me, House, Man Vs Wild, The Shield, The Ultimate Fighter, they all have a great quality to entertain, and all have a purpose. Purpose is one of the many things this PIECE OF ! sad excuse of waste lacks. There is nothing worth noting, bad acting, predictable and boring characters, horrible producing. This freak of a main character is little sad weakling who loves to see the work of other serial killers and justifies his own sanity by killing BAD PEOPLE! If he really wanted to help society in some way why in the world would he be obsessed with doing something so sadistic, repulsive, and pathetic it would also land him capital punishment! I hate to mention this characters name in this paragraph but Spawn at least is a dark super hero that is so fantastic fictional and original it makes sense. Spawn is also a superhero with super natrual abilities, this show is solely about the underbelly of society and the horrible pieces of ! like Dexter that crawl around it! There are so many more interesting and meaningful ways to spend your life and to entertain yourself, do those instead of watching this sad excuse of WASTE!

0307454541|5.0|I only read this book because my Mom forced me to, but in the end, I'm glad she did. The first 100 pages suck, and it took me 3 weeks to get through them. However, after the plot intensified, I could not put the book down. I read it on the beach, in school and even while walking around on my college tours! I finished the other 800 or so pages in about a week and a half! This suspense thriller is probably my new favorite book! I assure you that if you give the book a chance you will not be disappointed. As a 17 year-old i cannot wait for the next book to arrive at my house, and I hope other parents get their kids to read this! And any teens over 15 who read this, I guarantee you will thank me and recommend it to all of your friends. I already have 5 of my friends reading it and they agree that this book is amazing. Enjoy!

0312370849|4.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book and I finished it in a few days. I learned a lot about the Holocaust, but it was very sad and disturbing. One thing that was kind of a let-down was how the love story was a bit predictable and it reminded me of a chick flick movie. It was entertaining, but because of the predictability I can't give this book 5 stars. Also, the letters written between Sara's caretakers were a bit cliche and hard to believe. Are people really that nice? Maybe I'm just pessimistic.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Just for clarification: I am reviewing the 3 disc combo, not necessarily the movie, although the movie was good.<br /><br />I like that studios are making the bigger releases available in \\"3 disc\\" combos, and Iron Man 2 is no exception.  Since BD tech is relatively new, not all of my friends or family have BD players yet, so being able to bring my DVD to their houses, while being able to enjoy the full 1080p at home, is a definite plus.  The \\"Digital Copy\\" is not so thrilling (the reason for the loss of the 1 star).  I have multiple BD's with digital copies, and I have not had a good experience with one yet, so I don't even bother anymore.  I'll just continue to watch my movies the old fashioned way until they finally do away with it (the ridiculous DRM or discs all together - the more likely scenario).  I now understand why movie pirating is becoming so proliferant; it's almost as if they would rather you downloaded an illegal copy then get to actually enjoy the one you paid for!<br /><br />Things to consider when buying this 3-disc combo is that if you don't have a BD player yet, but plan to buy one and really want Iron Man 2 NOW, you can't go wrong.  If you probably won't buy a BD player, I would get the DVD alone instead (if they offer it, that is).  And if you already have a BD Player, and think the DVD is just a waste: maybe it is, but then again, maybe it isn't if you think about all of the people you know that don't have BD players and might want to borrow your movie, or have you come over to watch it with them.  And you can play the DVD in pretty much 99% of all laptops; so the DVD is a bit more flexible than the BD.<br /><br />There is also a lot of extra content packed into this deal, some 3+ hours of it.  If you like all of this extra stuff, then that's just gravy on top of an already pretty sweet combo deal (assuming you enjoy gravy on your sweets).<br /><br />Overall, for the great deal that I feel I got on this combo, it was well worth it and I have plenty of bonus material to keep me busy should I choose.lenty of bonus material to keep me busy should I choose.
068987474X|5.0|Very funny and fabulous read. I know how cliche it is to day a book changed your outlook on life, but this one definately did!!
B0044430H8|5.0|Reminiscent of but more accessible than Ghosts I-IV, all NIN fans should get this.  Five bucks for 66 minutes of Trent Reznor is a steal.  After a few listens I consider this not only a film score but also the first major post NIN album from Reznor.  Movie was awesome too, BTW(thanks in no small part to this album).
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Seriously? Follet is an idiot if he sticks with this crook of a publisher. My money just took a no-regrets hike to other authors.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|One of the best shows on TV and one I can't wait to see.  Looking forward to catching up and seeing season 3.
0439023513|5.0|The 3rd book in the Hunger Games series was AWEsome!  Wish there were more in the series.  I love Suzanne Collins.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE...BUT IT TOOK THREE WEEKS OR BETTER TO GET HERE AFTER I ORDERED IT!
0553805371|5.0|Thought inspiring, mind bending, truth seeking. A masterpiece that brings science close to philosophy and reality close to consiousness.  Great work from a great mind!!!
6305428042|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child, and it really brings back some very dear memories.  I really do love this movie, and honestly, every Halloween I get in the mood to watch it again and again.  I was just renting it every year, usually in VHS format, because it is difficult to find it on DVD.  I finally found it on DVD, and I am glad that I can watch it whenever I want.  I am 27 years old, and I still love this movie.  There are some really good actresses in this movie, and the storyline is very interesting.  The movie is fun and mystical, and it really gets you excited about the fall weather and Halloween right around the corner.  I give this movie two thumbs up!
B002TZS5GU|4.0|Well, it's not a zombie movie. However, it shares the same basic premise as most flicks from the \\"infected\\" sub-genre of zombie movies.<br /><br />There's an infection. It's deadly. It's not well-explained. People are panicky, stupid, dangerous and potentially deadly (whether from a gunshot or from a cough). Everyone wants to find a safe haven and avoid getting dead. Everyone is in survival mode, squabbling over resources, etc. There is little hope in sight.<br /><br />Like Zombieland and any number of \\"infected\\" movies, it's about a small group of people (two brothers and their girlfriends [or not]) traveling across the country, trying to find someplace safe to hunker down and ride out the course of the disaster. Along the way they meet a number of people, most of whom end up being at least somewhat adversarial. Over the course of the movie, most of the characters get dead...<br /><br />This movie is largely about the characters, as such things go. So, it's at least partly a drama of interpersonal relationships during a biohazardous crisis, though it's mainly a horror/suspense movie. Not so much scary as mildly unsettling at times, and with some obviously disturbing imagery.<br /><br />That said, it's pretty decent as far as such things go, without actually BEING a zombie movie. I had few complaints about it. I'd say it's pretty good and worth a watch or two.
0805091742|5.0|It won't take long to read this book but it packs a whole lot of useful information that is interesting and informative.  You'll be glad you read it and will want to recomend it to everyone you know in customer service/sales and in the public eye.
1407109421|4.0|Had picked up a paperback from Walmart when the movie was releasing. never touched it beyond the first 100 or so pages .... until last week. every book has an agenda. those who refuse to believe in it are either liars or idiots. the difference in Pullman's is that he has something against a very pervasive concept, namely, the religion of Christianity. The first 2 volumes are really very good. The part about the mulefa or whatever was really stretched beyond imagination. only in the negative sense. i fell asleep every night when I got to that part (i cannot afford more than a couple of hrs everyday) when he was in the mulefa world. the character building for Marisa, Asriel, Metatron etc were in my opinion very weak (even if this was intentional, I don't see the point of it). In comparison, even the gyptian characters were better. Gomez was a joke. That event with the tualapa or whatever and his night visit are a waste of the reader's time. Mary Malone, apart from doing the 'tempting' very well, didn't do much and i am angry that I have wasted so much time in that world that I cannot get back. Still, 4 stars because the first 2 volumes are excellent.
B001152TL6|5.0|The movie was mailed promptly and in excellent condition when I received it.  Thanks a ton!
0882709194|5.0|\\"There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance - that principle is contempt prior to investigation\\" - Herbert Spencer    Out of curiosity I just read the 150th Anniversary Edition of Origin of Species. I thought combining Comfort's Intro with the classic work was a worthy effort and fairly presents the two sides of the issue.     I'm not sure why Darwinists are are so afraid of Comfort's arguments. I've always had confidence in the ability of individuals to make up their own minds about such things. As with all things, this hopefully will be the launching point to dig deeper into the matter of understanding all sides of this issue. After all, it would seem to me, the stakes are eternal and worthy of our attention.
0765326353|5.0|Words can't do justice for this book.  I feel this series will be on my top ten list of best books of all time.  I was surprised at how high tempo the book was despite its length.  The sideplots didn't drag like I thought they might which surprised me.  Overall I was very impressed.  Well worth the money.  Brandon is working toward a marvelous story and world here while addressing what makes a human human.  Great work Brandon!
B003DZX3US|5.0|5 rating for the FILM ONLY NOT THE PACKAGE    I am a DVD person   Have been for 10 years now    My review below from the 2002 DVD Platinum Edition  IF YOU ARE A DVD PERSON LIKE ME GET THIS VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT.    Disney should be ashamed of themselves that they think everyone is going Blu Ray  Machines & discs WAY MORE EXPENSIVE.    Here the regular DVD has the 3 versions of the film (like the 2002 DVD did) & NO EXTRAS.  All the extras I want to see are on the blu ray  In 2010 Disney did the same thing they did in 2009 with the Diamond edition of Snow White  Blu ray pack in October & WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS regular DVD package Tuesday before Thanksgiving.    I hope that Disney LOST A LOT OF SALES BECAUSE OF THIS.  I KNOW I AM NOT HAPPY    ON THE FILM  A true classic & beloved film!!   Excellent story, characters &music.   The first animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.   Like many other Disney films, it was such a shame the category of Best Animated Film was not done for this year.   Never get tired of watching the film.   I do enjoy the DVD version of the film. I always enjoy making of &behind the scenes segments.
B003U0I9U0|5.0|This band came along in a time not that long ago (1980's) where music was busting apart due to the video revolution that brought acts worldwide into our homes. Music was so carefree and challenging then, A-ha captured America with their Take on Me single and especially the video which is one of the top 10 greatest to this day. A-ha were so much more than that slice of teen pop which it got relegated towards. I found their first collection such a wonderful piece of music perfection, mature and soaring sounds, I couldn't believe what a talented group of musicans and the vocals of Morten Harket blew me away much like some of my favorites from years earlier, The Beatles & Moody Blues for example. Sure the girls loved those bands to but radio was different then and shut these guys off in the states just as quickly as they embraced them. 25 really showcases all the sides of this adventureous band, I especially like their last song Butterfly, it sums so much up. They've made so many stunning songs(especially throughout the 2000's return) you'll find sprinkled through out this collection(and so many more that didn't make it) This band was influenced by many great bands as Depeche Mode comes to mind with Butterfly, Butterfly. I wished they had broken threw with radio but radio in the states sucks bigtime and leaves little room for real talent, its all manufactured fake gimmics that run the show, I will miss these talented guys from Norway but all you have to do is put this new cd collection on and remember how they use to make music.  I hope you still can collaborate with each other over the years and keep expanding your muse, peace a-ha
B002M9WW30|5.0|I am always a little hesitant to buy older films on bluray. Its real hit and miss with the quality. But someone took the time to really enhance the appearance of all six of these movies. The special features are very interesting, ranging from trailers, to documentaries, to even games. As far as the films themselves, of course they're great. Rocky 1,2, and 6 are really well made and are surprisingly grounded in a great story.  3 and 4, while cheesy, are always just fun to watch.  No comment on 5. Even Stallone gave it a 0.  But 5 out of 6 ain't too bad. It's well worth the money just to hear Clubber Lang's prediction for the fight: Paaaaiiinn!
