B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is by far the best calendar app, bar none.  Far superior than Google's stock calendar for sure.  But then it started to ask for constant Appstore login.  Not sure if it's due to Jelly Bean problem with Amazon Appstore.  Had to switch to aCalendar from Google Playstore.<br />Update: Appstore still asks for login but only once in a great while, so happy again!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very amazing effects. Like the action of playing the game. I hope that they make a sequel to this game. I would play it also. Hope there are games like this that are this creative to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really good and a good time passer,  I really like the character's and the fun arobatics, its good for your buck and colorful
B00AESN8XY|5.0|do I really need to explain my self?<br />the different types of plagues you can cause are grea I I I o I I .
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS.  Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to &#34;dazzle you with her footwork&#34;.  The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|best calc app ever Cuz it remembers equations and you won't ever have to do the same equation EVER again.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Well, let me begin with how everytime I try to open the app, it loads for a very long time and then brings me back to my home page. It is very frustrating and irritating. Plus, when it does decide to work, it lags and is very slow.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I really liked this movie. Lots of fun. Brought back memories of the spaghetti westerns. The story line was a little weird at times but the general theme was good and kept interest up during the whole thing.
0684857219|5.0|This book has been around for decades but is still a great deal of info the the weight lifter or just to get back into shape. Thanks
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Be Aware--these DVDs do not have the bonus features.  If that is what you crave, this is NOT for you.  However, if you just want to watch the movies over and over...this set is PERFECT!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  I have been watching since the beginning and it just gets better as it goes.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The maker of G5 Entertainment produces the best ever hidden objects.  From graphics to it's so amazing, very addictive and I can't stop. Keep up-to-date. I'm hooked this wonderful game.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|This is my second read by Ms. Flynn.  My first, &#34;Gone Girl&#34;, was so enjoyable I immediately ordered &#34;Sharp Objects&#34;.  While her brashness and readability was the same, &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; never quite seemed to get off the ground, e.g., redundant and slightly ponderous.  It's also pretty dark.  I understand &#34;Gone Girl&#34; was her third offering and I highly recommend it; I'm rooting for her and will definitley read what comes next.  Were I you, however, I'd approach &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; with slight caution.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app for people that have played or are just starting to play minecraft. Though it does have a long way to go this a great app for all ages. Hope you think the same way about the sane way about this app.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have used Avast on my PC for a long time it has cought Viruses that were overlook by boyh Norton and McAffee, to me it proves the excellence of the working team!
B0089XH38M|4.0|I am really glad that I found this for my kindles, I have 2 and used it all the time<br />works really well and keeps it safe.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. Much easier to play than some of the other ones. Like how there is always New missions to complete.
141659521X|5.0|I have all of Vince Flynn's books and I love them.  &#34;The Last Man&#34; starts out fast and stays that way.  In my opinion the best &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; so far.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I got this movie for my brother.  It is his favorite and it is a good movie.  I always liked this movie.  I would recommend it to everyone who likes Tim Burton movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent product. I am surprised this is free. Unlocks the passion of horses! A must have! THANK YOU! Have fun everyone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like Temple Run a lot but this one is just really awesome! It has a fun, cartoon like feel and funky music. It looks gorgeous on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and is best of all FREE. I highly recommend the addictive little ditty! :-)
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|the game is fun and addicting but it messed up my kindle fire and I can never play the game ever again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is addicting. I love this game . What I don't like is how the horses are so much to buy . And I wish there is one treat for free.
B00008EY5W|1.0|I had wanted this movie for a long time. It came sealed in plastic. I was really disappointed upon opening the package. Inside the SEALED case was BLAZING SADDLES. Needless to say, I sent it back. I would have given zero stars, but it was not allowed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have to read all three books again! I can hardly wait to start. This was one awesome series. I'm excited to hear there is going to be a second movie.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I'm one of the people who like to listen many kind of music. Madonna is the one of my faverite singer, i like melody of her song a lot.
B00479SVBU|3.0|This works wonders when you use memory/usb cards, but the auxiliary port is awful. I don't play using aux anymore.
B000002MUW|5.0|I'm one of the people who like to listen many kind of music. Madonna is the one of my faverite singer, i like melody of her song a lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I think it is one of the best period shows on television,<br />the costumes and house could carry the show on their own.<br />But the casting and acting is dead on! Maggie Smiths<br />character has the best one-liners! I love it!
B000002NJS|5.0|I'm one of the people who like to listen many kind of music. Madonna is the one of my faverite singer, i like melody of her song a lot.
0425263908|5.0|Great Book! I could not put it down and had to order the 2nd book in the series with in less than a week.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|The main characters are well drawn, the mystery held my attention, it was exciting and fast paced, but the ending was not plausible.  It was bizarre and, to my way of thinking, implausible.  The villain was crafty, evil, and with no redeeming qualities.  In fact the villain seemed to be right out of a Batman movie.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I decided to read #2 for the story! Alittle too much kinkery in all the books,<br />but keeps you wanting to finish the series.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|An interesting mix of science and faith this book is a good read for those searching for meaning beyond this world.  It doesn't promote a specific organized religion, but would by a great tool for those discussing Dr. Alexander's experience in light of religious beliefs and practices.
0345803507|5.0|I loved these books and im so sad im done with all of them now. This was the best out of all the books. It filled in all the blanks and now i just wish it kept going
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|I love Barbra Streisand and this was a beautiful piece of creative art work that spoke to the issues of our time!!!
0425263916|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I love the storey line and how in love they are. I can't wait until the next book.
0765325950|5.0|i loved mat in this book and perrin it was the best of the series in my mind.  wow i loved it
0670026182|2.0|Very disappointed in this book.  I'm afraid I was  hooked on the cover photo, and the rest was also a let down.  The cover recipe was a success, and the author is talented and full of knowledge and energy, but the entire format was<br />not interesting.  Usually, I am just wanting to bake my way through a book such as this, but not this time
B007L7JY3Y|5.0|2Do is one of the best productivity apps out there. I went a little crazy and probably looked at 100 different time management and to do apps, and 2Do is one of the half dozen apps that made my final \\"tops\\" list. It consistently ranks high on the Apple web site in both popularity and ratings. It's also one of few universal apps for iPhone, Android, iPad, and desktop, the only other ones that I found being Appigo To Do and Toodledo (actually, a website that you can access from your desktop or laptop), so if you don't like 2Do, you might want to check those out too. Please note that the desktop version of 2Do is only available from the Apple store.<br /><br />Both Appigo and 2Do do many of the same things, just implemented a little differently. The choice between them isn't easy because they're both so good. Perhaps it comes down to the aesthetics of the interface for many people. I really like the Franklin planner type design of Appigo but I prefer 2Do's task option menus which I find more convenient. They're both great apps though, and if you need a universal app they're the 800 pound gorillas in their categories. I don't absolutely have to have it on my laptop, so it you only need it on your iPhone, Android, iPad, or iPad mini, there are other choices that I also like such as Pocket Informant, and LifeNotes to do. Those are on the iPhone and iPad, not sure about Android, but anyway, they're worth checking out also if you don't need desktop computer or laptop capability. Whichever way you decide to go, good luck with your task and to app research and choice!
B00ANW33CM|2.0|Graphics were very grainy on my Toshiba Thrive and controls were incredibly sluggish. Lost interest after first level. This definitly wasn't ready for prime time.
B000092PT7|1.0|I made the mistake of buying the vinyl version of this album on another site because it was so cheap.  I thought, \\"Wow!  The only Jack Johnson album I'm missing and it's new on vinyl for only 7 bucks?  Sign me up!\\"<br /><br />The vinyl was 7 dollars because it is the worst sounding piece of music I have ever heard on CD, vinyl, or even a stolen 64kbs mp3 back when Napster was out.  Even worse than Red Hot Chili Peppers albums at the peak of the loudness war.  The vinyl is basically unlistenable.  I can't believe that the record company or producer or whoever listened to this piece of trash and allowed it to be released.<br /><br />I rip my vinyl to the computer for later use, and this is the first album I have ever stopped half way through due to poor sound quality, and I've bought some HEAVILY used vinyl records before.<br /><br />I will have to pick this up on CD, I guess.  What a waste of time and money...
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I was surprised at how different it was from the Vampire books and movies of today.  I guess things have really changed.
B00B0ZT9NI|1.0|I wasn't able to download it and therefore didn't see it.  Can you tell me what to do next? Thanks
B00942S4OY|5.0|My daughters favorite cd at the moment. Catchy enough songs for mom to enjoy, not too annoying like most boy band songs, so there is a happy medium when it comes to agreeing on music for the car ride.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is like wild blood for kindle fire I would do anything for an team vs team updatep you could get armorial its worth the download.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Very cute movie that has enough storyline to keep adults entertained, enough cute little blue people to excite the young ones.  My child has watched this movie countless times and can't wait for the new sequel to come out this summer.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I carry it in my pocket. It's light and convenient.If my blade looses it's edge I can just whip it out and sharpen.
B007KITQTQ|5.0|It may not be a classic yet but it will be, sorta like E.T. Wife didn't really care for the movie but she liked it better at home than in the theater. As far as being region free I can't say as my player will play anything.<br /><br />Shipping was screwed up but that's not on the vendor, maybe their method of shipping. The movie traveled the southeast from N.C. to Jax FL to Tampa to Pinellas Park back to Tampa back to Jax to Orlando back to PP back to Tampa back to Jax to Macon GA to Atlanta and finally back to PP and delivered, 17 days! Could have walk the 580 miles faster.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The game is highly addictive. Once I start playing, I just can't put it down. Would recommend this to all the people who love Bejeweled.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for anyone who plays. It is simple yet very fun. I was very happy with this app its great!!!!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is  a very addicting game. There is a way to win all the screens.  Just have to keep trying.
B000K3M1VI|5.0|This movie really brings out many of the 2d and 3rd order effects of the horrors of Nazi rule.  Lived in Germany for 13 years and know the German language well.  Still today hatred of the Jews is alive and real.Sophie was not a Jew, and many Priests went to their peril in concentration camps. At the beginning of the movie you cannot understand why Sophie makes the bad choices.  But as the plot develops, and the back and forth between the past and the life she lives in her current life, it becomes more clear how tortured her soul became  WWII is not taught adequately in schools now, and as our WWII heroes pass on, their stories only live on if we retell them and instruct our offspring the horrors resulting from the world of hatred  Germany adopted and kept silent about to this day.  Not till the end of this excellent movie does one begin to understand the tortured soul of Sophie and her choice.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Amazing album! Amazing purchase! Thank you!<br /><br />Let's have mas, mas, mas Macklemore & Ryan Lewis music!<br /><br />I love it so much!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|my friend has this game on her ipad and i thought to download it, it works great on the kindle fire!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This series has grabbed my attention fully and I've re-watched the entire series and continue to see more than I did the first time.  I've also noticed a play on words quite often and have had additional laughs due to that.  If you like paranormal and don't mind a little blood, a different view on angels or religion and the cult, you should definitely watch this!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is the best affordable DSLR bag out there! This easily fits my camera and all my supplies. You would think its not great quality but it absolutely is!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It's a good series, that grabbed my attention enough to want to continue watching.  I look forward to watching more as they come out.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This is a must have for any movie collection! They dont make movies like this anymore! Tim Burton at his best! Got this at a great price here on amazon compared to Target and Wal Mart.
0812993357|1.0|boring.<br /><br />She's a brilliant person with a fascinating life but the book itself has no life.<br />I took me over a month just to read the first chapter and I have no desire to keep going.<br /><br />I'll definitely be selling this one.
B005LAII08|5.0|Another awesome masterpiece that will go down in history with Pixar! You cannot go wrong with this company! Everything they make is gold! My son loves this movie and I enjoy the digital copy. One quick thing about the digital copy, it is not in HD. You would think it is but its not. Looks like dvd quality on the ipad. I would think that they would include an HD copy.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is truly one of the best stories and best documentaries I have ever watched.  What an incredible tale and an incredible man.  Wish there were more people like him in this world.  LOVE the music.  (Support him by buying his CDs.  Better late than never.)
B0096BIENY|5.0|Greatest Hits Il Divo was everything I expected it to be and more. I would recomend this Greatest Hits Album of  Il Divo to everyone.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Loved this animation... great message ... gave as Christmas gift... good for young and old alike... Can watch this over and over again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The program is proof positive that programing can be great with out violence, filthy language and bombs .<br />Hollywood directors take note.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|Gave as a Christmas gift... always liked the Horton series... when are they going to do Horton Hatches the Egg as a movie... even better!!!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I received this move in a very short time and it works great. I would highly recommend these guys to all my friends.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Gave this as a Christmas present....great message about the environment... great for kids old and young...Love Dr. Seuss... anything that he wrote is good for film....
B006JSXYPA|5.0|This was some of the best service I have ever received. The price and quality I received was outstanding. I will defiantly do service with them again. Thanks
817224164X|5.0|Ordered for husband he is enjoying reading it. Has another one and is reading both. Says I need five more words.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game,addicting .If love horses you'll sure love this game.One thing that I don't like is that you have to pay money to get gems.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Fantastic book.  Keeps you reading and on your toes.  As usual, Clancy comes up with some very realistic scenarios.  Keep them coming, Tom!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book gave me the experience every reader craves. I laughed, out loud, so many times. And felt the tug of the heart strings even more often. It has the perfect balance of all the emotions, with plot development that is lovely and unpredictable. This is my The Fault in our Stars for 2013. It does swear more than TFIOS and isn't YA, but it just brought me so much joy. My real sorrow is that it's over.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I read some pretty poor reviews before I bought it, but I took the leap of faith. It looks great and sounds great. Love it. A great upgrade from my battered dvds .
B00APJLFEG|2.0|It may appeal to a younger crowd, but we found more like a Saturday morning cartoon.  We did not enjoy it.
B0025TOH5S|5.0|One of my all time favorite Goldie Hawn/Steve Martin films. Totally worth the purchase/rental. I bought it. I love it. I think I'll watch it again.
159514188X|2.0|2.5 Stars<br />I have actually contemplated whether to write this review or not for a while. It is often hard to comment on a subject matter that is quite controversial and in this case quite apparent in modern society. Despite my hesitations though and to be only honest, I didn't love Thirteen Reasons Why.<br /><br />Within the book tube community I had heard raving reviews about this book. So when I took a casual drive to my local library and saw it sitting there I figured why not? If you have been following Maddi & I for a while, or even have taken a quick squiz at our blogger information, you will know that I read to escape reality. So I rarely read novels that are quite close to home on subject matter.<br /><br />In overall plot I thought this book was spot on in its idea that we don't ever truly know how much our words affect others. It was the execution that bugged me. At times I found Clay's inner thoughts to be dull and repetitive. When authors say rather than show I often find that it disrupts my reading. On the other hand I found Hannah's overall story to be devastatingly interesting and would much have preferred only her story. I do understand as to why it was written in multiple points of view - to better understand the lasting effects such a situation has on outside parties.<br /><br />This book did dive into the realities of the world, and the ever growing pressures placed on younger generations. And could be used as a stepping stone into awareness on this topic for adolescents. Overall it was the style of writing that annoyed me and prevented me from truly engaging with this story, but then again I am not exactly the target audience here.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|the fighting scenes while bloody kept me at the edge of my seat. How close is this to a real stroy.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|You don't know what you're missing until you try it. Even on IEMs that should be easy to drive you will hear a difference when your signal is properly managed. I am certain that there are much better standalone DAC solutions but for the portability and simplicity that the e17 offers you'd be hard best to find a better value.<br /><br />If you plan on using this with a phone or tablet make sure you get bit-stream audio. For apple users this means you need to get the cable that derives signal from apple's proprietary port, not your headphone port. For android users you can accomplish the same thing by using a USB OTG cable and AndroidOS 4.1 and later; however this may not work on all devices and could require you to jerry-rig something or modify some cables, do your research. The purpose of this is to bypass the internal components to give the e17 a digital signal so that it can do it's job and really shine. For computer use you can just use the included USB cable as you will likely want to charge your device anyway.<br /><br />TL:DR - The value is great. This is a great device for non-audiophiles or budding audiophiles who are not ready to commit to a big-boy setup. I think that the convenience of device still makes it a great buy for the guy who already has really nice gear but doesn't always want to carry it around.
B005Z28M58|5.0|So sad to see this series end!  Been a fan from the first season and now a the proud owner of all 8 seasons on DVD!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie is about following your dreams and going after what you want. I really enjoyed it as a kid and I also enjoyed it watching it with my son.
034580404X|5.0|Loved it!  Kept me interested through I found book 2 a little long.  Back into 3 and I was a happy person!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thought provoking to say the least. Keeps  you guessing.<br /><br />Makes you want more. Almost scary with what is going on now in the world. Thanks for the read.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|This movie should be required after seeing &#34;Lincoln&#34; or reading &#34;Band of Rivals&#34; or anybody who loves President Lincoln.  Excellent!!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book provided a great roadmap in order to understand habits, and how to change them.  I am going to personally use this to improve some of my personal and professional flaws.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I just purchased this app and I really like the features/options.  I do wish it would do a better job in the random select playing of the music.  I had the timer set to listen to the music for one hour with 118 songs loaded.  I heard 3  songs twice during that short time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is ok just a little addictive and played it since I got it for at least an hour or two it's good though
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like this version and it still entertains the toddlers. We were disappointed that the kindle doesn't support the Star Wars version but this is good too.
1455523550|3.0|This story was very typical like all abusive related story of a woman escaping and trying to make her life her own again. This story also reminded me of the movie sleeping with enemy. If u like those kind of movies u will love this book.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I have toddlers that LOOOVVVEEE this game. It is so funny the gibberish that the 'pudding monsters' use. They think it is hilarious to swipe the monsters right off the stage. Full on belly laughs.<br />I liked figuring out how to play this  game and it is quite funny.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app.  Very easy to use and save your favorites for future listening.  Search by genre or city and state.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My girl loves this game. Teaches her how to be more attentive and to focus on something. For someone who is typically 'flighty' it is a good exercise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is cool. It`s like playing Temple Run1 and 2. I play it all the time and I play it when I have to go to sleep.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|The access is the same at first it stated it would not work on my tablet, I went to the amazon apps. I downloaded from there site, it works fine. I am able to get in my account, buy items.  This app makes shopping easy.<br /><br />If you shop amazon this app is a must have.  I am very happy with it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The best imagination in this book E L James is so fascinating..the trilogy is one mission you don't want to miss....I am truly memorized with fifty shades......
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This books just makes you hungry for the next. You just can't give up hope for the Starks. You become emotionally invested in the Stark characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|His is one of the best addicting games ive ever played this game is a beast<br /> My experience with this game was full proof
B008M4MB8K|5.0|....and an EGGSCELENT price!  I love the entire box set and recommend this to any and all!  Enjoy you blade geeks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Touching.<br />Did  not want the story to end.  Loved it  Fell in love with the characters  and cheered for the courage and kindness
0894803123|5.0|This book is so much fun! Not only are the recipes to die for but the illustrations, layout and style is entertaining. I also enjoyed the history and little stories here and there...
B00338QF0U|4.0|Boyd is an accomplished writer. I enjoyed this book immensely. The action picked up immediately & it was book that was difficult to put down
B00006JIA4|5.0|Great to have must of the records in a single collection. Sounds very good. I will recommend this to a friend
B000FVNX2Q|1.0|This assigned rating is one star for my HP 12c Platinium which describes this calculator's value for my purposes - to make the calculations required for \\"Buffettology\\" by Mary Buffett & David Clark. The 12c comes with a Quick Start Guide and a disk which enables the downloading and printing of a detailed manual. The types of financial calculations covered were cash flow types; investment decisions and their keystrokes were not covered. \\"Buffettology\\" incorporates a Texas Instruments BA-35 Solar financial calculator.

B003B02O14|4.0|Detailed but not bogged down, ver good story line connected to reality. Nicely written characters easily followed. This story is completely plausible -?true to form Grisham.
B005LAII80|5.0|i enjoyed this version of Dredd more then the last one which was more like a campy version of the comic. Well thought out and can't wait for another one with the same actors!
B005FPT51K|4.0|As a straight out of the box camera to use on your Apple devices it works great, flawlessly even.  However the software included is horrible.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|This is a mid tower case with easy access to front, sides, top and bottom.  I would have liked easier access to a dust filter below the power supply, especially since I used the Antec power supply in the build, but this is a quibble.  Accommodation for up to six case fans is provided.  You can orient these fans to force air in through the front grill and exhaust through the sides, top and rear of the chassis.  Temperatures have have stayed well within the 25 to 40 degree centigrade range during normal operation.  I have not attempted to overclock the system as yet, but trust there us plenty of thermal headroom to do so.<br /><br />All edges inside the case are rounded and smooth.  There is space behind the motherboard tray to tuck cables out of the air stream.  A large opening directly behind the CPU lines up with a case fan mount.  While this may be fan overkill, I am getting cooling on both sides of the motherboard.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the quality and utility of this case design.  Recommended.
B00973902K|1.0|I had a free music credit and unfortunately clicked on this.  there was no way to verify the purchase.  At least it was free I guess.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the graphics are awesome especially for a free game! just wish it didn't cost gems to get new horses other than that its a really fun game
0143116738|5.0|Masterfully written, once I finished it once I began reading it again.  I suggest reading with a highlighter, lots of good points to refer back to
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This novel is a combination of hard sci fi and entertaining comedy. The science isn't hard enough to hurt your head or be a turn off for lay people, while sounding plausible and authentic.<br /><br />The realism and comedy had my 15 yr old son agreeing with me that this is a five star novel.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Me and my kids loved it,  And loved the price i will be buying more movies for my kids thanks
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is so much better than the first run. but I don't play it much. i prefer to read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|VERY GOOD BOOK.  I THOUGHT IT WAS SLOW IN  ONE PLACE BUT OTHER THAN THAT I REALLY ENJOYED IT.  KEPT YOU GUESSING UNTIL THE END.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such a great show!  The acting is amazing.  The storyline is incredible.  Wish there were more shows out there like this.  I'm hooked.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|This is by far the best resident evil movie made, even better than the new one. For sure need this in any RE fan collection.
B005HSL626|5.0|The BEST game ever made. My daughter discovered this game 2 years ago when we were in Texas. We she learned it was available on the Kindle Fire she said it was a must have. She plays it everyday.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|Written very well in an amusing yet informative tone.  The author is incredibly knowledgeable and adequately conveys their knowledge to the reader.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Childhood's End contains a large battle of ideas and at the heart of the struggle is the fight between Physics and Biology.  Physics has proclaimed its dominance over all the other sciences; Clarke says as much in the book.  But although Clarke is (and always was) a great describer of non-human processes, he possesses the same biological urges we all share.<br /><br />Clarke does not describe a great biological evolution that gives the book's title it's poignancy, he describes a very great transubstantiation of the human race--a change that brings more than our childhood to an end.  Biology, in particular evolution and Darwin, play no part in this strange novel.  Like many other books by Clarke I've read this book at its core is inhuman and eccentric, like quantum physics.  Clarke makes no concessions to the human, to biology, and Clarke's physics background makes this an almost sterile exercise in how to use the human imagination.<br /><br />The initial impetus for the novel is a story called \\"Guardian Angel\\" which is a pretty bland idea.  The expansion of the novel and its ideas caused Clarke to write a warning that the 'author does not share the opinions in the book.'  He also wrote a foreword distancing himself from the main conceit of the novel's plot.  Not a very auspicious beginning to the book!  Although the author's inner conflicts soon become the reader's, this book is still a great read once you understand the real source of conflict involved in its reading.<br /><br />Physics claims mastery over all our questions and answers.  I think this book exposes the problem Physics has with an inability to understand Life while at the same time being able to explain and describe life-processes.  True understanding is not the same as explanations--physicists use ideas that they admit they frequently do not understand (again, quantum physics is the best but not the only example).<br /><br />Knowing the conflicts inherent in the book, with Clarke's ambivalence on display throughout the story, will make your reading of \\"Childhood's End\\" an enjoyable and enlightening experience.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The Best of Me details the love story of two small town teenagers, Amanda and Dawson. Amanda hails from a wealthy family while Dawson is born into a family of misfits. By chance, the two fall deeply in love. As their senior year approaches the decision looms of a decision for the future. Forced apart, they are brought back together 20yrs. later when a mutual friend dies. This was definitely a page turner! The ending was rather predictable but I hoped differently with every page turn. Another great read from Sparks!
B00004TEUX|5.0|I've been listening to quite a bit of Mendelssohn lately -- Abbado, Haitink, Bernstein, Maazel -- and always in the back of my mind has been the fact that there is one indisputably great recording of a Mendelssohn symphony, and it's this one by Peter Maag and the London Symphony.  Listening to it again confirms that impression.  The work itself is a beauty, of course, with its striking and beautiful melodic character and its lively and luminously orchestrated development, and, as has often been noted, there's that little bit of Scottish kick in the finale.  What's amazing about this recording, though, is the sound quality, given its age.  Decca was recording the Solti Ring cycle in those days, and their engineers were on the ball.  Even Abbado's 1985 digital sound -- while maybe a tad more refined -- pales in comparison to the presence of the sound here.  And Maag conducts with a combination of elegance and forward drive that is just outstanding.  The filler is a fine \\"Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" a performance matched only, to my mind, by Haitink's recording, also from about 1960, that is just that bit more magical.  Maag's has an appealing rusticity for its part.  And, yes, I know that all that Decca \\"legends\\" stuff is a marketing ploy to get suckers like me to bite -- but at least the title is deserved here.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven is a great story of love and hope. A story of two lost souls who found comfort in one another. This one is a light read and not to complicated. It has enough plot and flow to keep readers engaged and intrigued. As with all Sparks books, I loved it.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed the story, it was very engaging and the murder mystery pulled me right in. Gillian's writing style is also quite entertaining. The problem with the story is that I didn't find the characters very likable. Perhaps the story the story would be even more appealing if it had a true protagonist to root for. So, I'm it 4 stars.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|this was a good movie,but not a great movie. my boy friend did not enjoy it though. thank you. j
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|This is a classic.  Very adorable and fun comedy.  It holds up to multiple viewings and has many quotable moments.  I purchased this movie in laserdisc and then DVD.  I've been waiting for it to come out in blu-ray to improve my visual and sound experience.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|you'd think this would be a good movie bc of the people in it, but it was pretty terrible and not really funny.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|A great modern re-visioning of the Sherlock Holmes story with a female Watson and in today's world. Jonny Lee Miller is great as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu is brillant as the female Watson. The plot was interesting as Holmes works on finding a modern day murderer. A great start to the season and I look forward to future episodes ...
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like the app over all. It has some problems. Sometimes it freezes or won't start at all and sometime it crashes. The graphics are nice though. Going to keep playing a while though. Unless it gets too frustrating.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Does all that it should.  Can almost be used as a simple diary.  Easy to use, just need to remember to use it!
B009RH973I|4.0|Does everything the manufacturer claims. Wish it had a smart cover, that would be a great feature, but it is not included with his model. If it was included, then it would easily get a 5 star rating.<br /><br />I was not misled or anything, Don't get me wrong. The hard back shell and color was more important than the smart cover feature that wasn't included.<br /><br />The connections are accessible, so are the buttons on the sides. No problems there.<br /><br />Overall still happy with it.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Those familiar with James Rollins will realize one is required to suspend belief to some extent in order to enjoy a good adventure. Such is true for the Devil Colony. I starts off very exciting and continues through out. I thought some of it was a little clunky... like the remembered love affair between two college professors. That was totally useless. It was already over and all one needed to be is a normal compassionate human being to care about the welfare of a long-time colleague. He didn't need to invent a love affair. But that aside, it was brief, the rest of the novel was a lot of fun.<br /><br />The novel focuses on the Mormons (LDS), Indians and one of the lost tribes of Israel that makes its way to the North American continent and  makes a pack with the local Indians of those ancient times. I am Jewish and I used to date a Mormon girl in high school and an American Indian girl in my 20's. I would guess they would share my opinion that Rollins makes some silly assumptions about our people's beginnings but the assumptions aren't offensive. Just a little silly, and fun.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and I will read it again and again.
1401235417|5.0|I wasn't able to buy the 1st print of the comics, so I had to settle with buying the Hardcover of this amazing story line. Part one of the court of owls leads us partially into one of the best Batman story arcs ever. This hardcover is a must to own. Don't miss out.
B001O03NCW|5.0|this movie  was great. i love to watch it over and over.this was my dads favored movie and horry potter
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely Love this game!!! So much more fun the temple run the first one. More challenges and more Awsome graphics.  The Best Ever!!!
0307730697|2.0|I'm listening to this book on Audible, an Amazon company. I don't know if I can finish it. Too much of Adam and his wife Kelly teaching Sunday School, holding hands in church, reading the Bible and so on. Then there's the bizarre recklessness of the hero - jumping from a moving truck over a bridge rail into a river 50 feet below, and the worst of all - sitting his naked behind and testicles on a stirred up fire ant bed on a $20 bet - not as a dumb teenager, but a grown man in the Seals. And his buddies and even some officers were egging him on, if this is to be believed. This was, so far, the hardest part of this book to listen to.<br /><br />People who are \\"fearless\\" are dangerous, to themselves and others. Courage is being afraid and doing it anyway. And it really, really astounds me that he even got into the military as a hard core drug addict, and kept relapsing - as a Seal, and some of his comrades knew it and covered for him. This is the sort of \\"I was a miserable sinner but when  I gave my life to Jesus he lifted my affliction\\" you hear in Southern Baptist churches (I know, because I grew up in them).<br /><br />There's another passage that is hard to get through, because of the amateurish writing. The author cuts between Adam in training risking his life and his wife's travails with their infant son, and seems to give them equal weight. In Outpost, about the hellish experience of a company of US soldiers in Afghanistan, the author also describes the wives and families back home, and it is poignant to see how they suffer, wondering if the ringing phone is awful news of their loved one's death.<br /><br />I did enjoy some of the descriptions of life in the Seals after BUDS and before they get their trident. The next stage when they first go to the teams sound as brutal as BUDS.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I Love this game. Angry Birds Rio is sooooo much fun! Thank you for the add free version.  So much better without those stupid adds.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Best show on TV! Season 2 is just as good as the 1st was. If you aren't watching this show, you should be!
B003BW0CB6|2.0|The ending was mixed up and left you hanging,I find it hard to believe,because Michael Connelly always is so good,I love his books.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i love the game but everytime i colse i have to deleat it and reinstale it cause it wont open.

1451696191|5.0|Touching, thought provoking.  Well written.<br />A lovely read that takes an intimate look into the fragile mind of a teenage boy.
B004IFYN2E|4.0|I'm not sure why a lot of people hate this movie. It's not Oscar worthy but it is pretty entertaining.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Got a bit addicted to the real time games and the dragons in this are very cute and never spent any real money on this game as I have patience you need lots of that if your going to play real time games
B00009ZYC1|5.0|For a used DVD this was in amazing shape. It literally looked brand new without the plastic on the case!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surf/Surfers is one of my favorite games. It is a good game to work on your fast reflexes. This is a fast paced game and requires fast pace moving. You constantly jump over obstacles and trains and turn to collect coins and power ups in this game. When you get enough coins you can even buy new characters and items. I reccomend Subway Surf/Surfers to anyone who likes fast pace moving games. I give this game a 5 star rating! So what are you waiting for? Go to the app store and buy Subway Surf/Surfers now! You will not regret it... share with friends and family too!!! :) :) :)
B00170I7GG|5.0|This movie NEVER gets old.  Bill Murray is a Master of the Dead-Pan-Sarcasm Phrase-a-Thon.  I would love to see him totally crack up sometime.  I'll bet that would make me laugh too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great Book..recommend it to anyone..held my attention throughout.Liked to back and forth of the characters life. Very well written with little swearing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great and realistic game. Everything works well, and it is fairly easy to understand. The pictures and graphics move great, and is educational. A great learning experience for young horse crazy kids.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Enjoyed this one as much as the rest of Abercrombie's books.  His world and his characters are so well realized, and i appreciate revisiting old acquaintances.  The weaknesses and and flaws of the characters are believable, as are their strengths.  Also, rarely am I as surprised by the turns and twists as i have been reading this author's books.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|For our nation's notoriously short memory a comedy series from the 1970's seems as ancient as the Fall of Rome. By that I do not refer to the season. This series debuted in 1975, one of the years a number of our college campuses claimed to have invented sex. By contrast Basil Fawlty, the lead character played by John Cleese, was hopelessly repressed, as blissfully insensitive as they come and possibly, some might add, as self-centered as our culture has generally become today. Cleese and his then wife and co-star, Connie Booth, did a brilliant job of writing 12 classic episodes with remarkable consistency in quality. Once writers establish such a rare, high level as their standard, all successive episodes must have become intimidating to try to emulate. I believe that accounts for the series being so short. Rather than keep cashing the checks, the writers wanted the series to end while all episodes were consistently excellent rather than continue and risk sliding into mediocrity. In any case, it was one of the shortest, and arguably, the best written comedies on TV.<br /><br />This brief, physical, farcical, linguistically playful, and clever humor greet the viewer today with as much intelligence, glee and irreverence as almost 40 years ago. Each episode plays with and counter to our notions regarding good manners, guilty titillation, irrationality, as well as lampooning a variety of national, ethnic, and gender stereotypes including Brits and Yanks. It was all fair game and almost always hilarious. Even the most outrageous script still managed to avoid being outright mean or cruel. Secondly, the bigoted, vain, greedy, foolish, lazy lout called Basil, managed to end up the prime recipient of retributive justice -- to our delight -- every show. He was too thick to ever learn his lesson, thank goodness. The supporting cast was also brilliant and essential as an early triumph of an ensemble comedy.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who loves British humor, thosewho appreciate analytical comedic writing, and for all of us who can laugh at the outrageously silly. But humor, like everything else dealing in personal taste, is a highly subjective matter. If you have never seen it, please use the magic of VOD or streaming to see if you like it before you buy it.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is to acknowledge that some of the plots have aspects that have not aged as well as others. We live in a different time with our own cultural and social sensibilities. For example, today humor making fun of gay stereotypes in particular is out of step with the majority of Americans and practically everyone else. IMO these jokes simply fall a bit flat today. I can't reject them solely on the basis of their being in bad taste because after all that was one of the fundamental principles of the show's humor. One could argue if it succeeded because of or in spite of its questionable taste.<br /><br />Basil embodies bad taste. His countless flaws are a pantheon of human weaknesses. Much of what makes this series so endearing and enduring is that it underscores many recognizable human frailties that are just as prevalent today as they were then. Yes, if you happen to be more familiar with British culture you will get a little more out of it but it is its universal appeal that carries it. Moreover, comedy in the hands of such gifted, bright, insightful writers and such an outstanding cast will help Fawlty Towers continue to delight new generations. Basil the Rat, despite himself, has earned his place in Western comedic history today as Basil the Icon.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|Love the show and love the treatment given the songs to modernize oldies and normalizesome of the more fringe genres. This is one of the best yet.
0671449028|5.0|My two year old loves this book and has for most of his life. It has a great rhythm and is fun to read aloud. It's nice because the energy is similar to the energy of most kids' bedtime routines. The sun sets, then the animals take a bath and exercise (kinda fun, a little high energy). But then things start calming down, and it ends with \\"They rock and rock and rock to sleep.\\" I could recite the whole thing, I've read it so many times. It's a great book to be part of a bedtime ritual.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|MY BOYFRIEND MADE FUN OF ME FOR RENTING THIS WHILE IN NEW ZEALAND, BUT THEN HE COULDNT STOP WATCHING! LOVE HER!
0694003611|5.0|Before I had kids, I had always thought this book was sweet, but simple and kind of boring. But my two year old loves it. It's one of his very favorite books. The rhythm is very comforting to a young child. The room gets slowly but progressively darker as you read, which is a nice touch and helps the child prepare for it being dark. I think it's a perfect bedtime book to read to anyone from birth on.
B007JOM7C4|5.0|LOVE HER MUSIC! BOUGHT THIS ON MY VACATION TO NEW ZEALAND AND IT HELPED MAKE THE TIME PASS ON LONG ROAD TRIPS!
0757302661|5.0|This is one of the best books ever, even though I didn't &#34;Hypnobirth&#34; just reading the book helped a lot!
B00571F26Y|1.0|It is the Atkins diet redeaux.  Why does a book called wheat belly tell you not to eat gluten free products?
B000OZ0NAI|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  i had the actual book but wanted this one for my e-reader.  This is a book you will want to read more than once.  I have read it about 5x and get something out of it every time.
B001GD5ALO|4.0|and I always liked Wonderwall, but it took an episode of Girls to make me take the plunge and I'm glad I did.
1609611543|3.0|I thought the general ideas were thought provoking and my husband , who is a physician, thought that some of the science was sound. But we both felt the author went overboard in his zealous denial of everything wheat, as well as connecting it with man conditions with dubious science behind those connections. He also managed to confuse the reader by equating gluten with wheat indiscriminately.<br />  The main message here seems to boil down to consuming fewer carbs which raise the blood sugar quickly, forcing more insulin production and resulting in laying down of visceral fat. This is a message worth noting, that simply substituting more carbs for fat is a problem.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I hadn't seen this film since I was a child so I decided to watch it one night when I saw Netflix had it. I'm so glad I did. It is indeed a very sad movie, it was so sad to see Dumbo being teased by basically every character in this movie. He is just too cute. The movie being too depressing is definitely not a reason to not watch it though! It's one of Disney's shortest films, being only a little more than an hour, but it packs so much heart into it. I had to go out and buy it just because I loved it so much.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I really enjoyed this story! It is different from the movie, but in a good way! I can't wait to read more of the series!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Surprised and content, a book for the ages. Abe's relationships are still current.<br />Makes you wonder why today's political arena lacks substance.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Never gets old, so glad I own it!  Love having the electronic copy to go with the DVD and the Blu-ray discs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|II have enjoyed the first Temple Run.  This one is quite fun.  Alot different from the first one.  Am learning little by little how the game works, and am enjoying every minute of it.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Is easy to read and interesting for teenagers.  Suspense and drama keeps you wanting more. I am still readying the book
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Absolutely love this camera backpack. Everything in it is able to be moved around to your preference. The internal zippers also have a flap that keeps the zipper from touching you equipment in it. I love the tripod straps on the side too. Easy to adjust and no rubbing on the neck or shoulders while wearing it.<br /><br />Amazing price when compared to the major competitors, but the quality of it is just the same.<br /><br />Need a camera backpack and don't want to spend a lot of money, then this is your choice to go with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a wonderful way to pass the time for long periods or short.  All ages enjoy this game.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked it. Way too much sex...lol. I found myself getting bore with it. But there was more story to this book than the first. I found Christian more likeable and Anastasia less annoying this time around. Um...there's a lot going on...a bit dramatic and overdrawn but okay...
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The plot was a neat idea, kids loved it, also included the obligatory fart joke to make every kids movie classic.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What a wonderful story. Sadly i finished this book the day that he was murdered.  Cannot recommend this book highly enough for anyone.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I am into mysteries and Castle writes an on edge story.  I start these books and finish them in one day.  I can't wait until the end.  I would recommend this series to anyone who llikes mysteries.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I downloaded this and have enjoyed putting the puzzles together.  Occasionally it will only give me options of no more than 100 pieces.  I close completely out of it and it goes back to normal.  I bought two other puzzle sets, one works great and the other one was blank so I deleted it but I was so looking forward to putting them together.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|fun, flirtatious and makes you want to dance!  i have had it on repeat for quite a while; definitely my guilty pleasure :)
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|No time for questions...buy one and you'll never regret it!  The live cd is a must have. It's definitely a collectible.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a read I will read over and over again.  I can't wait to see the movie and read more books from Chbosky.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have the wifi version of the Kindle HD 8.9&#34; and I love to play bingo.  I downloaded the program so I could play any time.  Since this is a Facebook app, you have to be connected to the internet.  Works and looks great but I'd prefer not to have to be connected to the internet to be able to use it.

B00004RF9G|5.0|Brigadoon has always been my favorite musical and my favorite movie of all time.  I enjoy watching it every so often.
159420411X|3.0|Reads nicely, but contains so many  mistakes.<br /><br />I started with the chess chapter - it's just full of factual errors.<br /><br />What is the stage of chess between the opening and the endgame? NOT \\"midgame,\\" as Silver repeatedly calls it. Any chess-player would cringe at this.<br /><br />What was the position after white's third move in the 1st Kasparov-Deep Thought game in 1997? NOT the one presented in the book. You don't have to remember the game to recognize this - just know how the pieces move, and be able to count to three.<br /><br />Is there \\"no real element of luck\\" in chess? In my experience, the opponent's choice of opening is very much a matter of luck. It's important, it's not under my control, and it's not deterministic.<br /><br />I could go on. And on. And yes, I'm totally geeking out here. But isn't this book, and Nate's schtick generally, all about geeking out? This isn't The Help! And when I find this many (at least 6) significant errors in the only chapter I'm qualified to proofread, how can I trust the \\"analysis\\" in the rest of it?<br /><br />Just like Radiolab, a show I used to love ... read this as entertainment, but not to believe or remember.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I very much enjoy watching Fawlty Towers.  I first saw it on PBS, but they no longer show it on PBS,

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very good all I have to wy is it tallest awyle and long time to load. Great horse game yeah I needed one of theses
0802136834|5.0|You would hard-pressed to find a character as interesting as King Henry, VIII.  He broke rules, made people bend to his will, argued with the Pope and formed the Church of England with himself in charge of it, of course.  Sounds very modern day.
1591844096|1.0|Terrible book! Highly superficial. Repetitive and without substance.<br />Offers no real advice...just words that that fail to convey any kind of direction.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Usually I prefer reading to watching television, but this series has made quite an impact on me.  I find the characters fascinating, the storylines hilarous and Sheldon Cooper my new hero.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best horse game in the world.......... yes it is amazing. hope you all loveit like I do... loving it...

B005DMNS4A|5.0|Growing up in the late sixties and the '70's, I was exposed to all kinds of music.  But the WHO were THE band.  This is about my third CD set.  I still have it on vinyl, too.  I always thought Pete Townshend must be lurking about as so many songs went straight into my brain as if he knew what it was like to be me.  I get hours of enjoyment when I plug into this.  The CD arrived quickly and in very good condition.
B004I744AS|5.0|This on line or off line dictionary is really good for school -work, scrabble, &amp; definitions.<br />its a really really great app.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Having never seen an episode of Big bang Theory, I got hooked on it during a bout with the flu.  These characters are so real.  Being a nerd, I feel welcome.  Of course, I'm sure Sheldon would have something in his roommate agreement contract to kick me out.
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved reading this book. It was such an easy read and keeps you entertained throughout the book. You feel the emotion's the Lack's family through Skloot's writing and get accounts of staples in the history of health care in the process. I recommend it for those getting into the health field and are interested in issues with access to care.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|A relative late-comer to this brilliant program, I decided to order all of the seasons that I have missed.  Not muchinteresting on tv, but I eagerly await each new episode.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Having missed the first several seasons, I finally discovered this program.  I catch myself laughing out loud at their shenanigans.  And, since I'm such a nerd myself, it is equivalent to needing comfort food.  I need to see these episodes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|hahahahahahahahhahahaha do not let the title fool u. it is a horrible game and I hates it. hdhdh dhhdhd Dundee bfjrbr furbelow hf fhf fbt db f
B000000OF6|5.0|This compilation of Queen music is pretty complete.  Everytime my 6-year-old grandson is here, he just has to hear the anthem &#34;We Will Rock You&#34;.  It covers a wide variety of their music before Freddie passed.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Les Mis 25th Anniversary concert  is just wonderful. The talent is ,just great,  with one exception. One of the Jonas brothers did not belong in that production.
0140281622|5.0|Of course, this book was required reading in high school and college and I am looking forward to reading it again.  The book arrived quickly and in terrific condition.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|That's what I kept saying the whole movie. I don't want to spoil it, so, all I can say is that the whole time watching the movie, I just kept wondering what would happen next. I dunno about replay value, but it was very entertaining.
1449433251|5.0|The books are very well put together and printed on coated matte finish stock.  This is not a light weight product.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Enjoyable time filler that gets those little grey cells working (once you've moved up to the higher levels). Some levels easier than others but some quite fiendish. Would definitely recommend it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Love it....so interesting. When I started reading I couldn't stop! I already bought the next book...can't wait to start it.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|COURAGEOUS - A movie with true Christian values. True Christians are courageous in everyday living. These men and their families lived true and joyful lives due to their faith in Jesus Christ.  Excellent movie.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I enjoy this game. I play only a few game this one I like better than angry birds it take a lot of analytical thought.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|The DVD was in good condition and I watched the entire season within a week. There is 13 episodes in the season so I was able to move onto season 2 quickly!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|amazing book! loved every second of it! the story line definitely wasn't what I was expecting. great work from colleen!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Overall, this game is one of the best board games out there. It's not hard to learn at all and most people that are new to the game get the hang of it within a few turns. One round is almost never enough, and so usually when there is more time to spare, another round is usually played amongst my friends and me.<br /><br />The price is a bit steep, but the quality is there and well worth the purchase!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved every minute of it! Buying the next book tonight! The ending is a crazy shock , if you have read it I would surly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I read the first book I could hardly wait to read the second and third.  Could not put the book down once I started.  I did not see the movie, but heard the books were better.  Will try to see the movie now that I have finished the books.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Best of the best.  Finally a greatest hits actually contains a band's greatest hits. I love it, top of my list.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|You need to pay attention no snoozing during this read,  I would recommend it especially if you have read the first two in this triology
B000TJ6CPY|5.0|This is the classic stuff.... nobody comes up to these guys. This album is a must for serious jazz collectors and novices alike.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I loved this movie, although my bf and I ruined it for ourselves by googling Rodriguez mid-film. Rodriguez is an absolutely incredible artist and poet. I highly recommend this amazing story to everyone, especially musicians. I immediately bought \\"Cold Fact\\"...I adore it & will be buying \\"Coming From Reality\\" as well. Rodriguez got ROBBED, in more ways than one, but his work, thankfully, is still here for us to enjoy. The South Africans had it right with him. What a beautiful soul.
0062127241|4.0|I cant believe he didnt talk about the first solo record!! \\"Who Came First\\".<br />I bought it when it came out and still have that original album. How could he not even mention it??<br />The book was good, but could have been better. Better than Rods new one,though.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|the beginning of the book was hard to keep reading due to the repeatedness of katniss being confused on whether or not she wants to be the mockingjay. but once the ball got rolling and the action started i couldnt put the book down. the ending was a twist that i found very sad but makes for a great suprise and overall a good book!
1592332803|5.0|This is our second copy of this wonderful cookbook! The recipes are clearly written and the baked goods are delicious. My son started using this book several years ago in high school, and now I've gotten my own copy.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderful story laced with historical facts illustrating how egos, pride, lies and ignorance led to the fall of governments but not truth and the idealistic human spirit.
B003U4ZOQ8|2.0|This Guy who plays Jack should return to his daytime soap opera. What is this silly acting called excitement at opening a book, secret package, untying someone. And good god, what childish sentimentalism.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is another way to challenge my mind even though my five year old grandson can beat me! NO need to recommend this to anyone, everyone is playing it already!
1250006341|4.0|I have become so insanely obsessed with this show. I have even found a $12 million estate in England to buy when I win the lottery! Completely nuts!! This book was beautifully illustrated and gave enticing little tidbits of behind the scenes information. I would  recommend it for any fan of the show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am simply hooked on Downton Abbey. I am staying current while traveling and I have recommended this to several family members and friends.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Excellent book.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and I can't wait to see what's in store next.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy this game even though I have not had the chance to play often . I have not recommended this to anyone as of yet.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric has always been one of my favorites, but his output had been slow of late, but this release make the wait worthwhile.<br />He still has his destinctive voice and has some fun on this release.  Highly reccommended.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I love this series!!!!! I can't wait until I start the next series, Bloodline.  Rochelle Mead is a wonderful author!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Works great and looks great, though you can't bring up the main menu while in 3D. Looks as good if not better than I remember it in theaters.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Bought this DVD about two years ago but lost it so bought it again to shed some of the holiday pounds. Jillian's combination of workouts will really make you sweat and work for the whole twenty minutes. As she says, \\"If you think you are going to die, that is when it is working.\\" She does a great job of giving examples for beginners as well as advanced level workouts. Also, the fact that all you need is some hand weights (use canned food if you don't want to buy some) is great too. Although the three levels can get monotonous. just mixing up the levels on different days keeps the workout intensive and interactive. Overall, great quality for a great price. If you are looking for a great workout without having to pay for expensive gym membership and have little time to get in an effective run, I highly recommend this DVD.
B004V9MU86|5.0|just beautiful from start to finish.  A wonderful dream of a story that should have felt like a tragedy, but left me glad to have read about it.
0792844890|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as an old school gift and we had many laughs while watching it together!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Beware, after the first few chapters you may be consumed by this book and unable to focus on much else!  It is well put together and really hooked me.
B008NMT684|2.0|My 2 yr old wanted this because of the cars and trunks, but got bored with it right away.  If your child likes puzzles it s ok, but it doesn't have any special options other then placing a FEW pieces into the puzzle spots.  Maybe more for 1yr olds.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great freebie. This plays smoothly on my Kindle and is a great option for killing time. I only play Vegas, but you have other options too. Glad I got it!
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Nothing new to say about this calculator, but buying at amazon was the best way to get a fair price and a good service. The product arrived in excellent conditions.<br /><br />The leather case for the calculator is great if you want to protect your &#34;investment&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. If u are looking for a fun fast game that will last, I highly suggest this game
B009HNDCC4|4.0|This is a very smart movie, seems to portray honesty in its crazy family life.  It's clean and wonderful entertainment
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is the absolute best game ever. I play it all the time. my friend showed it to me and it is still great after months. I just want a newer version. I want more jetpacks.
B001609SQA|5.0|I warned the movie in order to prepare myself for the game, which takes place after the second aliens movie. I really enjoyed the movie and I'm definitely ready for the game, Aliens colonial marines.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|AN AMAZING story that makes you understand the sacrifice how warriors make everyday. Rest in peace Chris Kyle. This world has lost a true hero.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a great follow up to Worth Dying For, it follows Jack's quest to get to Virginia and he lands in big trouble once again. I hope what ever is waiting in Virginia is worth it!
B0053O89U6|5.0|By far, one of the funniest shows on television!  The cast is top notch and they bring their A game to every episode!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Terrible book - don't know what all the fuss is about. Even the sex is poorly written and unimaginative! Don't waste your money.
B003L77GHE|5.0|Started a marathon of this show and haven't been able to stop watching since!!!  Love it!  Once again, vampires/werewolves/supernatural elements and I'm all over it!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Bought it to built my super hero collection.  Got all three in the series and a fraction of the cost.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Didn't think I would like this book (not generally into the whole magic genre) but it was riveting and I couldn't put it down,
B004APVI1G|5.0|Got it for my grand children, they liked the 3d feature of this movie.  A lot better than what I had before.
B000SEI230|5.0|I just have to say that Nicholas sparks knows how to keep a reader engaged when it comes to love!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be, but  because of the star of the movie, I rented it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Just love it. Such beautiful settings and obvious quality in the period costuming of the cast. Can't wait for more!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Bought it to built my super hero collection.  Got all three in the series and a fraction of the cost.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The book has a lot of similar characteristics of fifty shades, but it kept me interested and it was easy to read
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|Got it for my grand children, they liked the 3d feature of this movie.  A lot better than what I had before.
0060012358|4.0|well written, as all Pratchett's books are. Not a barn burner but well worth the time to read it. recommended
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Bought it to built my super hero collection.  Got all three in the series and a fraction of the cost.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|As a horse lover and owner, I am always looking for fun horse apps to share with mu daughter. I love how interactive this game is and how you have to do something to train your horse and compete. The only downfall to this game, like many others, is the fact if you want to be able to enjoy the full game or own more than one outfit or saddle it is going to cost real money. having more items you can buy with coins earned and even a couple of the horses would put this game far above the rest.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Bought it to built my super hero collection.  Got all in the series and a fraction of the cost. Loved it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|sucks.. graphics are good though. pointless, timewasting game. if u like this, then get jetpack joyride. but of course, this is crap compared to minecraft!
B005MMYBXI|5.0|I loved this purchase based on the fact that I was able to view it immediately with Amazon Instant Video.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This was even more fun than the first. Bring on more with recurring characters. More mini games too.love the hidden object games by this company.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|The cd wretched and divine was amazing it made all my expectations I personally loved and I would buy it again
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey provides a great escape to experience life in Anotjer time and place.  This series is entertaining, full of surprises and emotionally touching.  Beginning with life in rural England in 1912 on a large estate with a staff that plays an integral part in family life, it is easy to imagine that this is a reality show of long ago. The luxury and lifestyle offer an escape from the world of today and yet provides a glimpse of where some of our traditions originated. Five stars all the way!
B0063M22QO|2.0|The unlocking of more difficult levels is confusing, I can't make it happen. I enjoy Majhong in many different styles
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love that the 3 parts make you aware that a plot change is coming, but you have no idea what it will be.  Gillian Flynn has a real gift of story-telling and can portray very specific thoughts and feelings in few words.  I read for pleasure and usually am not one to analyze literature, however I often found myself pausing in awe of her writing.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is the perfect app for anyone who is interested in my little pony.I loved it since I first played it.Any person who loves or likes my little pony friendship is magic has to play.100/00percent of the time of when I am home I play this or another game like this.:)
0670020478|1.0|Did not answer the question \\"How to find your passion and change everything\\". If you're looking for concrete self-help, keep looking.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I totally like the game but hello heard of temple run subway surfers really brilliant different names it's a train station not a temple the big black cop is running after the man and in temple run the monster is running after him and u can unlock different people oh wow I could have made this game all u have to do is have temple run a tween it a little but hay it's fun and a cool game it's all fun and your stole game till u get sewed.I don't care though temple run was getting boring great game though  guys my dad is a top cop and he doesn't like internet bull that can lead to bullying thanks but comment if u think my review is good if not keep rude comments to your self
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved every book in the trilogy and I am sad to see it come to an end...goodbye Katniss Everdeen!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it a lot the inlet thing is I can't get a highscore is so have but I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A1AF4DM|1.0|I love Michael Crichton work. It started with \\"the andromeda strain\\" back in high school and has even include his work \\"A Case of Need\\" as Jeffery Hudson.  I enjoy reading all his novels even stuff like \\"Congo\\" which isn't his best work.  Other than a few of his latest works, I have gone back and read them all a few times.<br /><br />\\"Micro\\" is the first book by (and I use the term \\"by\\" very loosely\\" Crichton that 1/4 of the way in I was dreading reading and the only one that I didn't bother with the last few chapters.<br /><br />For a story that starts off with killer tiny robots, there is next to no tiny robots involved the action of the plot.  Sorry Michael but the bugs were done and down well in \\"Honey I shrunk the kids\\" as other have stated.<br /><br />I felt zero emotion for any of the characters, as they all started dying off it mattered little to me.<br /><br />If you are true Crichton fan and feel you must read this novel and in truth I don't blame you for giving it a shot. PLEASE DON'T BUY THE BOOK, CHECK IT OUT FROM YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY.  The publisher deserves no profit from what truly in not a Michael Crichton Work.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Dude buy this movie. Cheap, anyway.  Gerard Butler is very attractive regardless of his scars, honestly. Also, great uh...effects and stuff...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of the comics this series is based on will love this show. As well as any fan of zombie movies.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|The movie was great! Very enjoyable! The movie looked great in HD. However, I think the rental should last more than 24 hours. Also, it was a tad bit overpriced...
B0085A9J18|3.0|I am a big fan of these over the top &#34;one man against an army&#34; type flicks and this one was a good watch. As in all movies of this type the plot is a little weak. But the real show is the fighting. And theres lots and lots of it. Bought this one as a gift for a friend of mine that also likes these type of flicks.
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite spy pictures of all time. Matt Damon is the perfect &#34;Mother,&#34; an uptight CIA controller, whose calm exterior belies a ruthless drive against the cold war foes of his day. Damon's character is torn between his duty and his obviously failing marriage and difficult relationship with his son. A great movie, in the tradition of LeCarre.
B00000IUT7|5.0|My grandkids love this locomotive so much they wore the first one out... this time I bought each of them one.  they love it
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Like many fellow reviewers, I was expecting FLIGHT to be more of an action-oriented examination of the plane crash.  It ultimately is a story of addiction, denial, loss and redemption.<br />Director Robert Zemeckis artfully guides a powerhouse cast in an uncompromising portrait of a man refusing to admit his addiction, regardless of the collateral damage.  Oscar winning Denzel Washington is deservedly nominated again this year for his stunning portrayal of Whip, a pilot who miraculously crash lands his plane, saving 96 people but losing 6.  He is a hero until evidence emerges he was drinking and using cocaine the morning of the disaster.  Washington shoulders the weight of the film and gives perhaps his best performance in a totally controlled portrait of the addicted pilot.<br />The opening crash scene is brilliantly executed and disturbing.  Denzel is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast---Don Cheadle. John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Brian Geraghty, Melissa Leo and the underappreciated Tamara Tunie (Law and Order SVU's Dr. Warner).  I liked Kelly Reilly as fellow addict Nicole, but often had trouble understanding her which diminished my appreciation of her performance.<br />I highly recommend FLIGHT mainly on the basis of Washington's devastating performance.  He probably will lose the Oscar to Daniel Day Lewis, but his nomination cements him as one of cinema's best actors.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Such a gorgeous album! His best, by far!! (And I know his albums forwards & backwards.) Such beautiful songs! His voice is amazing! (My all-time favorite male voice. In a category by himself, really. No one else comes close.) Beautifully produced! Heaven! :)
B005LAJ16I|1.0|The line on the box, &#34;From the producers of '24'&#34; says it all.  This  is a simplistic, ponderous, turgid, self-important parade of cliches. I got it because it was recommended for people who liked The Killing and other Nordic noir series, but it doesn't come anywhere close to them in characterization, complexity or sophistication. Avoid.
B003TNM2K6|3.0|This is a monster movie. I felt like I'd seen it before, probably because I liked the novella as a young teenager. The actors did their jobs well and I was excited to see the story fleshed out. I rate the special effects 7.5/10, and this movie needed good effects to help us believe the story.<br />The characters are caricatures at times. Now that I'm almost 40, I was annoyed by the one-dimensional &#34;religious fanatic&#34;. Religious people (i.e., Christians) are so often unfairly represented as crazy, stupid, hateful people in films and in many of King's works. His fanatical fundamentalists are too bonkers to be believed. I like King's tales, but writers who pen such ultra-weird and pious characters seem to have some sort of complaint that would be better taken up with The Management. It's uncomfortable to watch idiotic zealots on film and wonder, &#34;Is this film suggesting that all religious people are like this?&#34; I've never heard of anyone like Mrs. Carmody outside of a Stephen King story.<br />One last thing, without detailing any spoilers: the ending might kick you in the gut. Be ready.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Love this series, even though I have to shut my eyes a lot because seeing people about to get hurt freaks me out. I wouldn't consider it gory by today's standards, but I wouldn't encourage young children to watch it.
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|this sucks don't bother if ur under 18 it will be a waste of time so if ur under 18 don't even bother.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Just the rehash of the first move. With her trying to get out of the underground, undersea research station, by killing everything in sight.
B001BR3P0S|5.0|I enjoyed this movie years ago, and it's still just as good as it was then.  A study in what makes us unique, and the boxes we put people in.  Fun character study, well acted.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Although not a big fan of St. Anger, I think Metallica made a great comeback with this album. Loud, fast and in your face. Back to their roots. Some people don't like this album very much, but if you liked their &#34;pre-mainstream&#34; albums like Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning, this is a remastered album with that type of energy.
B001F12J48|5.0|i have wanted this movie for over two years now. i am really glad to be able to get it thanks
B005974CNA|5.0|Dream Theater is probably my favorite band and this album does not stray from their already incredible lineup. I had this CD in my car for months straight. Anyone that likes metal, prog, symphonic metal or hard rock will like this album. The songs on this album, much like the rest of their albums, are varied and impressively composed. Any musician will find these songs complex and at the pinnacle of each instrument's possibilities.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|good game; I really enjoyed it.  I did have trouble tapping on objects during an HOG scene; it just wouldn't let me choose the item.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|If you love the TV series, you will love this novel and the others in the series.  They are like two peas in a pod.
0425252868|5.0|Good book for Christmas gifts.  Recipients all enjoyed reading it.  Glad I heard about it on the radio during an interview.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  get to play with friends on facebook.  I have seen the movie and it was funny.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We didn't start watching this series until after the second season had finished.  Because the first two series were availabe on Amazon, we decided to try it out.  We loved it so much that we watched the enitre first season in one week!  Then we did the same with season 2!  We just couldn't get enough!  Now, we're watching Season 3, and we can't wait for the next Sunday to come so we can watch the next episode.<br />Well done Masterpiece Theatre!
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|I remember the critics' opinions being very neutral to negative about this movie. I found it moved a bit slower than necessary but otherwise is was moderately enjoyable. I felt like I got what I paid for - no more, no less.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Jack Reacher's last novel as an army officer. Helps us understand why he leaves the Army. Good fast paced plot.  Short story that is included is nice vignette of Reacher's childhood
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a simple calculator app but it works great. Love how big it is. Exactly what I was looking for.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Shipped in amazing time! Must've been here in two or three days. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Buy Pitch Perfect!
1454901276|5.0|THE BOOK HOOKED ME FROM THE BEGINNING  -<br />I'M NOW A FAN OF PETER MAY'S WRITINGS  -<br />I'VE ORDERED THE 2ND AND 3RD BOOKS<br />OF THIS TRILOGY  -  CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY<br />ARRIVE IN THE MAIL
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love my kindle HD fire and now with the standing case I can take it even to my workplace and have fun in my lunch break.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|It's film noir all the way- the dialogue, the lost hero, the mystery, the shadows, the narration, Billy Wilder's directing, William Holden's self depracating humor, -the average guy trying to improve his life, Erich von Stroheim's creepy and suspicious presence, and Gloria Swansons' performance -an unstable and delusional state of mind-wow! She should have won the Oscar for that year. When I had seen this film when I was younger I didn't appreciate it, I only liked it. I just saw it last night and perhaps maturity helped me to see it in a better light. It is understandable why this is one of AFI's 100 must see films and why it is registered with the national archives as historically and culturally important to cinema. As Swanson'sd character said these people &#34;had faces&#34;. They grab your attention- not just with the tight stroyline but also with their presence.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was awesome once I played it I was addicted to it for like 5 hours it got an update with armor and nether stuff
B0067EKY7M|2.0|It was nice but I couldn't buy into the love story or the importance of salmon fishing in the desert. I like emily Blunt and Ewan MacGregor but somehow this story fell flat.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is on  of my favorite games of all time! So, I was thrilled to buy this game. It met all my Minecraft needs, so now if I can't play it on Xbox, I can play it on the go where ever I go!!<br />I incurring you to buy this game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Simply great read. Highly recommend it. I was worried that about the ending but it did not disappoint. It was short but enjoyable.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|Excellent belt pouch for a small camera and batteries.  The velcro closure works for a couple years, and it hangs unnoticed from your belt so the camera is always with you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's smart, it's fun, it's cleverly written, the acting is superb! it's not reality TV and and live for Sundays because of Downton Abbey.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series - - - - - - love the characters & the story - - - - - I don't have anything else to say,  do not like this minimum word requirement.
0143034901|5.0|Fabulous book. The colorful prose is right up with Steinbeck and Kesey.  A captivating story with mystery, humor, compelling characters, and hints of the supernatural. All the raving reviews are correct
B000002HB4|5.0|A good number of songs on this compilation.  It's strange, back when the Georgia Satellites big album came out (the self-titled one), I was big on it, plus some of the songs from the later Let it Rock compilation.  It's only recently that I decided to go back and pick up subsequent albums.  It interesting how much GS sounds like classic era Slade though.  Now, there are some differences of course.  Both has raspy-voiced singers, gritty guitar, raunchy songs, etc.  GS was a little more roots-rock, a little more piano, a little more country.  Slade was a little more metal, and were raunchier, and of course Slade had one of the top five rock vocalists of all time. On the other hand, GS didn't wear some of those silly glam outfits that Slade wore in their glam years.  Overall though the style and sound of both bands songs were very similar.  At any rate, I would tend to say buy the first three albums instead and then choose the songs you like, although this comp does have Hard Luck Boy and Let It Rock on it which are very good songs too.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great characters, fantastic plot, and a protagonist that breaks the mold.  A not your typical hero, hero. And knowing that there are more novels out there means that you will have something to do for a while.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is pretty cool but confusing I love that it is about horses and is really cute too. I need 2more words to submit this. - purple cat

B00913P6G0|5.0|Kendrick Lamar's first official album `good kid, m.A.A.D. city' is one excellent piece of work.  Lamar's talents as a vivid story teller and lyricist shine through.  That is combined with strong and sonically appealing beats.  Lamar is complimented with many excellent producers, Dre, Hit-Boy, and Pharrell among them.<br /><br />I'm not normally a fan of West Coast Hip-Hop, but its sound is untypical of the West Coast. The lyrics have more in common with East Coast Hip-Hop. They are reflective, rather than in your face.  He has more in common with Nas than Dr. Dre. The delivery and mood have similarities to Southern Hip-Hop. Lamar often echoes OutKast in his rapping style and drawl.<br /><br />Each track on the album reflects the realities of inner city life in his hometown of Compton - the gangs, drugs, violence, and unkempt women.  Lamar isn't celebrating those things; rather he is telling a story about it.  As the title suggests, Lamar wasn't actually into that stuff, but he was always in the middle of it.<br /><br />For an album that features so many gritty themes, the mood is mostly mid-tempo.  It is seldom fast or hard hitting. Most tracks have a laid back vibe. My favorite six are `Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe', `Backseat Freestyle', `Poetic Justice', `m.A.A.d City', `Swimming Pools (Drank)', and `Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst'.  Any deluxe edition is worth it for the excellent `The Recipe' and `Black Boy Fly'<br /><br />My only complaint is that the last two tracks are just okay.  So the album could have had a better closing.<br /><br />`good kid, m.A.A.d. city' will be considered one of the best hip-hop albums from the second decade of the 21st century. (4.5 out of 5 stars)

B002NEFL8W|4.0|Most of these reviews already cover the Canon BG-E7 Battery Grip's best and worst traits. I thought I would just reiterate what I have found to be the most pleasing aspects the unit.<br /><br />First, I bought the grip for use when recording digital video. I appreciate that the BG-E7 Battery Grip can accept the Canon batteries or AA batteries. That leaves a nice safety net when doing long complicated projects like shooting digital video.<br /><br />Second, it adds quite a bit of size and mass, which makes the Canon 7D setup look very professional and intimidating. So if you were using the camera for press related events, you look like you belong with a massive monster of a camera setup.<br /><br />Third, the BG-E7 Battery Grip is very easy to use and attaches easily. It isn't perfect, as I use a silicon protective body skin and the BG-E7 Battery Grip doesn't work with it (I have to just remove the skin), but it is an adequate unit.<br /><br />I also like buying Canon peripheral products for Canon units. I have found Canon to cost a little more, but Canon tends to be a bit sturdier and work seamlessly.<br /><br />Those are the things that I find pleasing about the BG-E7 Battery Grip. Just an opinion, but I would<br />recommend the BG-E7 Battery Grip to anyone interested in a backup battery unit for his or her Canon 7D.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I chose this app because it sounded like a great concept...and at first it is, but without fail, the app crashes on the third or fourth 'flip', regardless of which board I am flipping through. Hence, the 3-star rating.<br /><br />I'm using it on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;. Of course the Fire can't be ruled out as the source of the problem either. No way for me to know, but the Fire doesn't do this on other apps. The second and probably the most problematic issue (if it didn't crash all the time), is, when selecting a youtube link from Flipboard, it enters a continuous loop, and there seems to be no way of getting back to Flipboard. I had to uninstall Flipboard and re-install it. This is a definite show stopper.
0525478817|4.0|John Green's The Fault in our Stars is a great young adult novel for lessons on love, loss, and suffering.  Hazel, Augustus, and Isaac are, in some ways, typical teenagers who experience their first loves, fights, and breakups, and therefore are relatable to the young adult audience.  However, their medical conditions make them unique, and give them different perspectives on the world and their relationships with both family and friends.  Hazel's fear of building relationships because of the hurt that she might cause is something that can reach young readers who are afraid to open up in their own relationships for various reasons.  When Hazel does open up, she is eventually hurt, and that is a reality of life.  The important message to take away is that Hazel does not regret her time with Augustus and wish that she had not been hurt.  Instead it teaches a lesson about appreciating what you can have and handling disappointment and loss.<br /><br /> The themes in Green's novel can certainly be taught to a whole class, focusing on relationships with family and friends, the fear of hurting a loved one, and handling loss.  I think a message about appreciating and experiencing life with the time you have is incredibly important to any teen audience.  However, it is also a good book to keep as an independent read for students who might be going through more similar situations to the characters.  For a student who is either diagnosed him/herself, or has a loved one who is ill or dying, Green's novel provides characters who are also suffering and let their guards down.  It can show students that it is okay to falter from the \\"strong fighter\\" that Hazel describes as the typical cancer patient.  It is impossible for me to know how any terminally ill person is feeling, but Hazel, Augustus, and Isaac could very well be for someone what Anna in An Imperial Affliction was for Hazel.<br /><br /> The only cautions for using this book in a classroom setting would be some of the language and the sexual scene in Amsterdam, but these elements are important to the story.  The language shows the emotions that a sixteen-year-old experiences, especially in their situations, in a more authentic way.  The sexual scene in Amsterdam, and the discussion of it both earlier in the novel and after it happens, show the reader Hazel and Augustus's desire to experience a full life in the short time that they know they have.  That being said, I think The Fault in Our Stars would be best used with students in grades 10 to 12.  These students will find the life experiences that the characters have more relatable, and the content more age appropriate
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I got a kick out of the backlash of knee jerk impulses by the general public to hate anything that has a tendency to drive them even one degree from their irrational ruts.  The point of the story is simply the natural events occurring in the lives of one American family in the 1950's from all the banal every day goings on to the inevitable tragic episodes of life transposed against the reality of the rarely considered bigger picture which has always and continues to be going on, with the immensely large and simultaneously immensely small universe.  All of this from one son's perspective.  Brilliant and refreshing.<br /><br />It demonstrates the dichotomy of the seemingly importance of our own personal lives juxtaposed against a cosmos where everything is either equally important or nothing is.  That's the question we have to decide.  The truth is that it frightens people and they don't want to be forced to think about that.  The natural reaction is anger. I've seen that in people my whole life.  I don't think we should be frightened though, as much as we should be inquisitive.<br /><br />On second thought . . . Maybe it wasn't about that at all!
B0089AD8IO|4.0|I'm so very hooked on this series. It's been awhile since I've seen season one, and I was delighted to find it was on sale. I had forgotten how different the quality was before Stephen Moffat took over, but It was wonderful to watch the series from the (new) beginning.<br /><br />I've loved this series from the first time Christopher Eccleston grabs Billie's hand, telling her in a no nonsense voice to run. I've been running with the Doctor ever since, and I'll keep on doing so until some idiot decides to cancel the show.

B0093OGBL6|4.0|Of the now immortal Michael Jackson.  The media severely distorted the true human being under the bling, behind the shades, without the one gloved hand. I wouldn't say I was a fan but did like his music.  After reading this book, I walk away a fan of the man, the humanitarian and the father.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Not very good at all. Bad graphics and not worth any money what so ever! Accidentally bought this and wish I never did!

Easily Therion's best since \\"Secrets of the Ruins\\" - ***Doum666***<br /><br />I wasnt sure either about an album full of french covers. It didnt really sound like a \\"Therion\\" thing at first (but thats only before i pressed \\"Play\\"). I didnt really know what to expect but i knew that the band's last  album \\"Sitra Ahra\\" was a bit more complex than its 2 predecessors \\"Gothic Kabbalah\\" and \\"Sirius B/Lemuria\\". I looked at the titles of the songs and realised that they were all very well known french songs, mostly old classics, pop and traditional songs......I knew i had to get this......and im glad i did!<br /><br />Hearing these classics and traditional songs sung by Therion and their choir was something i never would've thought possible. I was amazed to hear these songs with a \\"metal/choir\\" twist. I think thats the real beauty of the album, its like simplicity with an agressive touch. Usually, Therion's songs can be long, and full of complex arrangements. These french songs, being very simple and basic in their original form, were just the perfect songs to be adapted by a band like Therion. They were able to keep the melodies and main structure of the songs intact, giving the band plenty of room for nice solos and choir breaks. Lori lewis is an amazing soprano, her voice fits just perfectly with all the songs, giving them clarity, density and sensuality no matter what the mood is. Probably one of the best vocal performance given on a Therion album yet. No need worry about the french, even if you dont understand it you wont even think about it after a few minutes in the songs.<br /><br />As oppose to many others, i really got a kick out of the Artwork inside the album. All of it. Being highly sexual and suggestive but still obscure and classy at the same time,i think it captured the feel of the album just perfectly. Whoever did this deserves a pat on the back. I think some of the artwork was provided by Saturno Butto. I havent check his website yet but i sure will. Amazing artwork, hands down.<br /><br />If there's still Therion fans out there that are not sure about the french songs and still wondering if they should get the album or not should not hesitate. The album goes through a lot of different feels and each songs captures a different element of Therion's wide range of metal melodies. There's a song for every fan on this record. There's a few highlights of course (Poupee de Cir, Initials BB, Dis-moi Poupee ) but the peak of the album and its glorious celebration is definitely \\"Je N'ai Besoin Que De Tendresse\\". The song is played fast with an in-your-face 90's power metal groove, high pitched vocals (Take that Justin Hawkins!) and glorious choir arrangements. The whispering part at 1:39 by Lori is simply georgous.<br /><br />Overall an excellent album with plenty of originality and diversity. A must for any Therion fan. This is no pop music, trust me. Its a metal masterpiece.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!at the same time,i think it captured the feel of the album just perfectly. Whoever did this deserves a pat on the back.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|This series is incredible!! I fell in love with every character. I went in the first book cautiously because I thought I knew what this book was going to be about and how it would end. I was completely wrong and I am totally fine with that. I read the second, third and fourth book all within a two week period and I still wanted to know more. These are the types of books that I know I will be reading again. I laughed, I cried and in the end I realized that magic can be anywhere, you just have to be willing to notice it. My favorite series by one of my now favorite authors.
1250006341|4.0|Downtown Abbey has captured the attention of millions world-wide on television, and rightfully so. It brings to life what seemed to be a mystery - even perhaps a romantic, tempting fable - for all of us 'normal' people.<br /><br />And that's what makes it fun, and Jessica's written epistle is fun too. It puts into words what each of its fans watch and hunger for each week while watching the television show. And it breaks down the story and history so well that the reader can't help but feel apart of the story.
0345505387|1.0|If I didn't know better and if the author's name wasn't on it, I would think this graphic novel was a satire of Outlander. The writing is pared down way beyond what was necessary for a graphic novel and to the point of making the characters a joke - vapid, dumb, vulgar, you name it. As for the illustrations, I can't imagine that the artist had any clue about these characters other than the simplest description. All the male characters looked so much alike that I never knew which one was speaking! The only way to tell them apart was to memorize the tartan they wore! Obviously the Jamie character stood out somewhat because of his red hair, but even that tended to be so dull that it blended in with the background. As for Claire, nowhere in Outlander did I ever get the idea that she was built like Dolly Parton. Really, unless the target audience was adolescent boys, which I doubt it was, the drawings of Claire had no resemblance whatsoever to the character in the books - neither the descriptions of her nor her personality. For that matter, Jamie looked like a dopey, broody adolescent and the words in his \\"bubbles\\" pretty much backed that up. This really was a disappointment.
1250027624|4.0|Downton Abbey is a television series that has become the new Dallas, Knots Landing, Falcon Crest, Young In the Restless, and Eight Is Enough rolled into one - and it is the show that you can't get enough of.<br /><br />And this companion book, Jessica Fellowes and Matthew Sturgis have crafted a book that you will want to keep out for all to see. It is a piece of artwork so inviting and appealing that you won't not want to treasure it.<br /><br />The characters, the history and all other things vital to Downton Abbey's existence for the first three seasons is explained in such a way that it is as if you are there - a part of the story, the family or the secret circle.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Absolutely outstanding! Great second half of the adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking graphic novel. Loved Superman as the uber-patriotic pawn of the President, who, as in the graphic novel, bore an uncanny resemblance to good old Ronnie Ray-Gun (and wouldn't he have LOVED to have his own Superman to get those mean old Russians). Fight between Bats and the Boy Scout was great. I always knew that Batman could kick his butt! REALLY hope they get to The Dark Knight Strikes Again, the sequel. Best DC Animated ever done, both parts 1&2.
B002GJU54E|2.0|The last of the in-between books in the Stephanie Plum series. Maybe thats why Evanovich threw everything she could into it. It was pretty rediculous in many aspects, and funny in others. Didn't bring out the best for the main characters. The monkey theme got old real fast. The story line was lame and too silly to even think it believable. Maybe its best this is her last In-between books. I will miss Diesel though. I was disappointed in this book.

B002TVQ4HG|3.0|Unless someone's told you what Triangle is about you're probably going to insert it into your DVD player, sit back and expect it to be a brainless slasher flick at sea, ghost ship flick, supernatural beings messing with or, well some sort of fun demise viewing of a group of attractive young adults movie.  Possibly even a Dead Calm type scenario since they're on a yacht after all. It is sort of some of those things but it's a lot more complicated a plot than one you can enjoy if you are tired and just want something simple to sit back on the couch to watch before calling it a night. It's best to actually stop reading here if you haven't seen it yet, not knowing anything about this film will help you enjoy it the most, but if you're still undecided whether to give it a go, I'll tell you how it starts in the next paragraph.<br /><br />The confusion starts right at the beginning of this one, the words on the screen tell us it is funded by the UK lotteries, yet the scenery and houses and buildings are clearly Australian, including electrical sockets, yet for some reason the vehicles on screen are those only found in North America and they are driving in the right hand lane, which is incorrect for the UK or Australia.  Also these British actors are talking with fake American accents. Is this all deliberate though? This bizarre scenario is only the tip of the iceberg once the movie gets going and the yacht hits a storm that is obviously more supernatural in origin than anything that should be possible to be encountered. Things don't look good survival wise until an old passenger ship appears which seems deserted, but the group know they saw someone on board from their upturned yacht. Why has no one come to meet them?  Where is everyone?  What's with that message in blood on a mirror?<br /><br />I won't mention anything else about the plot but you've got to be paying attention the whole time to understand (or come close to it, as fully doing so is probably not possible), no getting up to make something to eat and coming back minutes later, no going to the bathroom, if you do you'll miss little cultural references such as to the Shining, you'll miss clues such as the name of the ship being important to what is happening.  Even if you are paying attention, you'll still probably miss a lot of it or it will go over your head unless you are some sort of scholar of non famous to many, European mythology, it did mine. That's why I only rate this film three stars, even though yes it is being clever, but you shouldn't finish watching a film and have to say huh? What the f was that about?  Maybe if I go back and, hey look at the name of the ship, let's Google that and see what results we get. Ohhh, so that's what that scene about.  Cultural references should be to things the majority of viewers would know, if they aren't then they need to be introduced or explained in the film by the characters or something like this before the parodying begins.<br /><br />I had to come on here and read other people's reviews to know stuff such as (and going over these gives away more spoilers) that Aeolus is a Greek ruler of the winds.  Therefore it is assumed by some people you should instantly know from the ship's name, that the timeline repetition for the main character is obviously referring to another Greek myth about someone called Sisyphus who was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill yet it would always roll back down so he would have to keep doing it over and over again.<br /><br />I think knowing how the film ends, and knowing the cultural references that this would be a more enjoyable movie to appreciate as a second viewing than was possible the first time round.  However it's just not that entertaining a film to want to see it a second time round.  That's coming from someone who lives on the Gold Coast where this thing was filmed and have the hey there's the Southport Yacht Club and various other landmarks to point out to myself while watching it.getting up to make something to eat and coming back minutes later, no going to the bathroom, if you do you'll miss little cultural references such as to the Shining, you'll miss clues such as the name of the ship being important to what is happening.

B000AP04MO|4.0|\\"Two for the Road\\" might sometimes make you feel annoyed or fidgety while you watch it, as it did me, but it sticks with you. After having let it sit in my memory for several months, I feel like I can review it.<br /><br />I had never heard of it when I came across it at the video store. \\"A young Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn? That's for me!\\" I thought. Two of my favorite actors at any stage of their careers, and Albert Finney was irresistible as a young man in \\"Tom Jones.\\" The box made \\"Two for the Road\\" sound like a screwball romantic comedy, so I was not at all prepared for what followed.<br /><br />First, if you expect Albert Finney's character to be endearing, modify your expectation. Sometimes he is, but often he's an arrogant jerk. Audrey Hepburn's got a bit of an edge to her character as well.<br /><br />Second, if you expect a conventional romantic comedy, set that expectation aside. While the movie has some very funny scenes, and you see lots of lovely French countryside (as well as a variety of cars for automotive buffs), \\"Two for the Road\\" makes little effort to be crowd-pleasing or predictable. Instead, we travel down the rocky road of marriage, in an experimental but not wholly successful series of flashbacks.<br /><br />We begin with an unhappy English couple, architect Mark Wallace and his wife Joanna (Finney and Hepburn), flying to the South of France to meet an important client of Mark's. The movie goes back and forth over a twelve-year period, following the couple on various road trips through France, to look at how they started, how they arrived where they are, and what the future might hold for them. Sometimes they are close, sometimes they are distant, sometimes they are happy, sometimes they are alienated. They don't always treat each other well.<br /><br />The acting is good and Hepburn and Finney have great chemistry. The tone bounces all over the place, by turns romantic, wistful, caustic, and trying too hard to be hilarious. The pacingis a bit herky-jerky as well, and some episodes go on too long. For instance, when an obnoxious American family first joins Mark and Joanna on their travels, it's funny, but we get tired of them before Mark and Joanna do.<br /><br />By the end I felt worn out and unsettled. But as time passed, I realized that was the point. Instead of an easy-to-digest fairy tale, the filmmakers present a version of truth about a long-term relationship in a turbulent world of confused values and ask the audience to think for ourselves along the way. As a result, \\"Two for the Road\\" stays with the viewer in a way a movie that spoon-feeds the audience can never do.<br /><br />The DVD we rented had only fair sound and picture quality. This unusual movie deserves some restoration.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We had to break down and buy the tv pass when all of the other options were exhausted. The tv pass was great when watching via our roku. Great series
B000NY12LO|5.0|I loved this book it was not what I expected and the ending was also not what I expected I recommend this book for people who love stories mixed with murders/mystery
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found the details of the unexplained very interesting. The science behind the inner workings of the mind and the experiences that he had as well as the other stories the author weaved in were well written and accessible no matter what your background is.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I bought an android tablet to use as ereader because of bad eyes.<br />A shot tutorial would be nice.  I would reccommend it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app. Is Very easy to use!!! I like the way it shows what your adding or subtracting as you go along. Love it!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a fun read! I loved the back and forth between the points of view of the two characters. It was very dark and twisted. I thought the ending was perfect.
B001O1O71C|3.0|It was okay. I watched the movie and was curious about the book. I doubt I will ever really think about the story again.
B0050R0XEG|4.0|We had several VW vans when I was growing up. My brother wants to get a real camper van to transport his family around; well, he may not be able to convince his wife about getting a Westphalia but she shouldn't have any objections to this one!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Would like to give 4.5. I really like playing this game.  I play it a lot in fact, and it does get challenging. I do wish there were a reason to play the game again and again, like trying to beat my own score and time. Other than that, it has nice graphics, runs smoothly &amp; has lots of levels. I will definitely check out this developer's other games. Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very well acted! I especially enjoy english pieces!<br />Recommend to all who love period stories.<br />The best drama on TV!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is good for all ages.  Good eye hand coordination.  Will teach angles etc.  You can really get hooked on it
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|There are quite a few reviews here complaining of the difficulties getting this thing balanced, so I wasn't surprised when I couldn't get it right too. I was trying it with my Canon GL2 and figured it just doesn't work with this type of Camera. Then I added the additional weights and bingo...it nearly balanced straight away. I shot my first video running up the stairs and down hallways in my home and it was doing a pretty nice job. I leave the adjustment locking screws slightly loose to make adjustments as it does tend to need fine tuning, but for the money I paid there isn't anything I can complain about. Well, except the manual. I just downloaded Merlins SteadyCam manual which has some good suggestions. But honestly, the trick with this is the weights. The lighter the Camera the fewer you need, and the heavier the more. The product is well made for this price range, and unless you are a pro making some big bucks I highly recommend saving some dough and choosing this over the models at 4 times the price. Good luck and enjoy it.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The threat this book portrays is real.  It represents the most glaring weakness in our strategic defense posture.  As always, the technical detail is sound, while the exploits of the protagonists are a bit far fetched.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I had read many wonderful reviews of this game in IGN, Gamespot and others. One day I saw on sale and buy it, excellent decision, it bacame is one of my favorite games on my Kindle.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I would have given it 5 stars, but not too sure I liked the mystical &#34;Jo&#34; at the end.
0689835604|5.0|At first our grandson had this book from the public library.  His mom regretted having to return it since he liked it so much.  I decided to buy one for him for Christmas.  We have 4 grandchildren under 18 mo., so we bought this book for all of them.  They like the interaction of lifting flaps, etc.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|&#34;I put my neck on the chopping block, but no one else was saying it&#34; Harrison says of his massive hit &#34; My Sweet Lord&#34;.  The entire 2-part DVD follows the magical journey of the incredibly magical George Harrison. He has more to teach us all than most people realize. Open your heart and watch this DVD multiple times. Much gratitude to Martin Scorsese and dear Olivia and Dhani Harrison for producing this critically important masterpiece.
B0090RSYVG|5.0|It's a solid, durable little Lego piece with bendable horns and legs. The chain and link are very strong, and it is perfect for purses, book bags, and car keys. Overall, AWESOME! I couldn't ask for anything better.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I give this novel 4 stars simply be a because it was completely gripping from start to finish ,excellent character development and I couldn't put it down
B007MU85D0|4.0|My daughter recommended this to me - it's good, but not entirely my style. However - there are some really good things on here that I do like (as with most albums!)
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I decided to read this because I am always curious how people who claim to be spiritual are perceived by those who know them.<br /><br />The spiritual person in question is actress Shirley Maclaine and the verdict isn't great.<br /><br />This book is a memoir by her daughter Sachi Parker, an actress herself who seems to have spent most of her life longing for her mother's love (and not getting it).<br /><br />The text is comprised chronogically, starting with Sachi's lonely childhood in Japan with her complex father and his cold mistress. Basically MacLaine wrote in one of her autobiographies that she sent her young daughter to live with her husband in Japan claiming it was to keep her daughter Sachi safe from kidnapping threats. As an adult, Parker questions the veracity of her mother's account and indicates that MacLaine's disinterest in being a parent allowed her father (and MacLaine's husband) to use her as a pawn in his manipulations against her mother.<br /><br />Sachi's father (and MacLaine's husband) was a business man named Steve Parker. As the book goes on, the reader learns that he pulled off an almost-unbelievable three-decade's long con on MacLaine, bilking her of millions of dollars. Even knowing of MacLaine's new age beliefs, the details of this con were jaw dropping. I don't want to spoil this for you: All I will say is NASA, the Pleiades, and a clone figure in the mix.<br /><br />Throughout the memoir, Parker describes struggling with her self-esteem and in finding sincere men to date. She tries hard to excuse her mother's neglect and selfish behavior, but Maclaine does not come out as the better parent. Near the end, in particular, MacLaine's former publicist pulls Parker aside and discloses some painful truths about MacLaine's (alleged) sabotaging of Parker's efforts to be cast as MacLaine's daughter in a film.<br /><br />At first, the author does not want to believe that her mother would do that to her, but she comes to feel that the allegationsare true. Even with what she must see as a betrayal, what separates this book (for me) from being a \\"Shirley Dearest\\" is that Parker's longing for her mother's love and approval is almost palpable.<br /><br />As I finished the book, I came to feel that Parker is carrying a lot of pain and I believe that her intentions in writing this are to make sense of some very confusing emotions and life events, not to settle scores.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Interesting, I discover something different about it every time I listen. I am impressed with Two Steps from Hell's musicality, arrangements, the power that so often shines through and yet the delicacy to contrast. I don't think you will be disappointed in this on, or in Archangel or Invincible, either - I have all 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great and addicting game! I would definitely download this! My favorite game ever! Great for all ages not gender specific either!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Sometimes I love this film; sometimes, not so much. It really is fairly complex and raises a lot of issues which I, interested in political science, find thought-provoking and intriguing. The acting is quite good; it gets 4 stars for some of the film work and a few scenes which really don't move things forward much.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its a really good game. But its kinda hard 2 control. Like if I wanna swipe 2 the side, it doesn't always let me. If I wanna go down, it won't let me. If I wanna tilt 2 collect coins, well, you get the idea;)<br />I mean, it's fun and all but it would b better if u could actually move when u wanted 2. Thanks 4 reading my review:)
178022219X|2.0|I am not basing this review on the novel but on the print. It is very small and light. I do not suffer from eyesight problems but this I'd really small for relaxed reading.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this is a fake not an original game the company owners stole this idea from the competitors ......(the makers of temple run)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|DEFINITELY  WORTH 5 STARS!! (: and GREAT FOR YOUR CHILDREN who wants a horse.Easy to use even for a beginner reader.  SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS, GREAT GRAPHICS.  Glad to have gotten this app.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|Individually I'm a big fan of both of these artists and their blue's music roots and traditions. Both men have a tireless work ethic, Ben has since 1994 been involved in numerous successful collaborations but this one ranks up there at the top. Of course Charlie has been a blues harmonica icon since the 60's.<br /><br />\\"While Harper has made an art out of getting the best from his collaborators in the past, it's here that fans can finally feel as though the guitarist and his guest are taking the notion of teamwork to heart.\\"<br /><br />Both men bare their souls and become a force from which it is impossible to turn away.  These two artisans blend their unique styles effortlessly producing an awesome sound laced with a touch of John Lee Hooker's confident strut and pace. This is old style blues at its best!<br /><br />They first met in the mid 90's and worked together on John Lee Hooker's \\"The Best of Friends\\" (1998) [[ASIN:B00000DCER The Best Of Friends]] as well as some other collaborations, including Musselwhite's 2004 choice release \\"Sanctuary\\".<br /><br />Charlie's harmonica easily fills the spaces of each and every song which is what he does best without overshadowing the moment. Not saying that at times his playing can't sound like a 747 flying over at 50 feet when the arrangement calls for it.<br /><br />This one reminds me of another favorite collaboration of mine by \\"The Big Head Blues Club\\", [[ASIN:B004EKP5SO 100 Years of Robert Johnson]].<br /><br />I'm not going to go step by step through every song as my fellow reviewers have done an excellent job with this one. Ben and Charlie are \\"locked in, like kindred souls\\" as the fellow musicians state.<br /><br />It's just a really great record, so \\"Get Up !\\" and dial into a classic.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was very fun compared to a lot of other mystery/hidden other games that I've played. It helped pass the time during the blizzard!

B007B6VOG0|4.0|Fun. is great, but I still miss the Format. Fun. is definitely, well fun! Poppy music. Catchy lyrics. Good musicianship.
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|I received a copy of this CD for Christmas from my husband.  However, when I played it, it &#34;warbled&#34;.  Thinking maybe something was wrong with my player, I tried one of her other CD's, which played perfectly.  So, I decided to order a new copy from Amazon, thinking the first one just had to be a bad CD (it happens, right?).  I got my new copy the other day.  I opened it and played it yesterday, after I had already been playing other CD's, so I knew again that the player was working perfectly.  The new copy &#34;warbles&#34; too!  It makes me sad, because I love Susan Boyle's voice, and I really wanted to hear this CD, but I tried listening to several songs, and the sound quality is the same throughout the CD.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love Richard Armitage! This story is beautiful. A poignant love story. I actually prefer it over other British dramas, like Pride and Prejudice. The cast is great. Costumes are wonderful.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Just the best kind of human interest story with great acting and plotline that brings you along wanting to know each person.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|Having raised a child who experienced early trauma and attachment issues, this book was not easy but very realistic and compassionate in representing their experience and sometimes incomprehensible reactions. Dealing w attachment issues can be difficult and unpredictable, but love and wisdom ,over time can find a way.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Another well made Marvel movie. Fun to watch again and again.<br />I would recomend this to any one that likes adventure or sci-fi movies.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|Don't know why I picked this book to read . I like the show Castle,just thought I might enjoy the book. Not so. Just found it too slow,couldn't hold my interest.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|The Matrix has a unique story line and the blu-ray picture looks very good on my large screen plasma tv.
B0083V2WBS|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this cd/dvd. It was everything I hoped for & more. Really glad I went ahead & got the set because I enjoy having the additional info that comes with the &#34;making of&#34;. I love Hugh Laurie's music & his sense of humor...with this set, I got them both
B001KZVQJI|4.0|Peter Jackson did a great job bringing Kong to life in this version, The blu-ray looks great to.<br />The only criticicm I have is that there are a couple of very far fetched scenes ....like people running under dinasours and stuff.<br />It just didnt look realistic and those few scenes should have been left out: But over all this a well made and fun adventure movie.
0375413405|4.0|This cookbook has more information than I thought it would...very helpful. In time, I may learn to love it, after I've had a chance to really use it. The only way I could have given a higher rating is if it made the recipes for me!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Overtly sexual references overshadow the music. It is unfortunately with the rage of Glee and Smash. The comedy and music are good.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is awesome me and my friends play it all the time and we even have competitions! totally recommend this game!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I Was taking a long drive to my orthopedic in Trinity so I brought along this.and instead of the ride feeling like 2 hours it felt like 30 minutes!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever I truly love the gameplay and the horses and competing treating and feeding and caring for the horses.
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|I placed my order with a  specific company because I thought that would mean quality but NO I cant believe they had the nerve to mail out such a scratched up DVD, it looked like kids had been playing with it & I WILL NEVER DO BUSSINESS with that company again !!
B000TEMRXA|5.0|Excellent download all of their greatest hits.  Really take's one back to the good old days!  Very, very nice memories.
B00992CF6W|4.0|ita an awesome app but it will freese up and i will try and shut my kindle down then it will loose my data and ill have to open and close the app repeatedly for about 10 min and it will come back id dont understand it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very well done.  recommended for all who love horses.  you will be convinced you are with the real thing.  very nice.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This continues to be enormously entertaining and is one of the best crafted in terms of storyline and characterizations my wife and I have ever seen.  After the first few episodes in season one we were hooked. Don't miss this one.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|We laughed out loud on many parts. Our kids loved it and so did we. Definitely a must have in your movie collection!
B0098VXMNE|4.0|It's not the Spartacus of Izzy Demsky (aka Kirk Douglas), but with the technology the fight scenes are much closer to the tools of the trade and it's well done for what it is.  On to the next season
B00881VLCE|4.0|While the graphics are outstanding, the game itself could use some improvements. The first two would be especially helpful for the 288 piece puzzles.<br /><br />- Custom background and scrolling bar color<br />It is difficult to determine the shape of dark color puzzle piece edges on both the black scrolling bar as well as on the dark blue game board. This really takes away from enjoying the game. Ideally, the player should be able to change both background colors as there is no single color that is right for all puzzles.<br /><br />- Trays for sorting<br />Because available space is very limited on the 7&#34; tablet, it is nearly impossible to sort puzzle pieces by color or by shape. A couple of movable trays, at the very least one, that can be minimized when not in use would be helpful.<br /><br />- Freely movable puzzle pieces<br />When trying to sort a few puzzle pieces on that small available space, they snap to an invisible grid causing some of them to overlap which defeats the purpose of sorting them.<br /><br />A die hard jigsaw puzzle fan will still enjoy the game despite of its shortcomings.
B005LAII80|5.0|If you're looking for a futuristic shoot 'em up with 3D in-your-face action, 'Dredd' will deliver!  Excellent 3D effects, non-stop action a no-nonsense look at one possible future.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I stared this game and loved it but after a time it stared to stop working I bate this game now do not get it
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I believe this was a very good story.  I like the way he didn't take advantage of her.  The story showed that there was a lot of respect for the way she felt and he was cosiderate enough to value her feeling.  The second time he proposed, she was well aware of what he wanted.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Whole family watched, some language & adult stuff but we got thru it. Great acting.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|The camera is very nice and takes clear pictures. I have found that if a person is standing in front of you and you hold the camera, so they can see what is being taken they are more likely to go and purchase the product themselves.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is so awesome. I love minecraft!!! I don't know why some people didn't get the update because I did. Overall it is AWESOME!!!!!!! :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game way too much and for way too long! Very fun game with good graphics. I never knew a review required a minimum number of words. Pretty lame.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I haven't gotten to play it since it will NOT load.  I press it, it acts like it is loading, then goes back to the main screen.  Bummer.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I love this movie, my 2 year old isn't that crazy about it, but that it is actually good because it's kind of scary looking in some scenes.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|Lacked the fidelity from previous Sandler Movies. At times it felt like low quality improv. I would not recommend to a friend.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I am 30, my son is 2, we LOVE this movie. Tom Hanks is fantastic, the animation is fantastic, it is a movie for all ages. WONDERFUL. My son has it on repeat ALL day long!
B008KE3960|5.0|I don't know why, but this game is super addictive. I did buy an add on which really isn't necessary.  It's free and fun, so just get it. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it needs way more maps.  There was one update adding one more map, now amazon seems to have just forgotten about it.  Since I purchased add ons, I feel there should be more maps to play.<br />Update: They have added a few more maps since I wrote this, so I changed my review to 5 stars.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Can you say loudness war. It's atrocious that Metallica allowed the album to be released in this form. I just downloaded the FLAC version of the album for Guitar Hero and there is a whole world of a difference. Virtually no clipping, clear bass, beautiful drums (it was recorded in Sound City after all) and crisp voice. So do yourself a favor and just download the Guitar Hero version. My original CD is now in the trash and I burned the other version to a CD and put it in the original case I got from Amazon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read positive reviews and negative ones about these  books.  Everyone is entitled to their opinions.  I personally love the books.  Miss James doesn't have the best writing style.  But I've read worse.  But she's woven a great tale about love and mystery.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the ride.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Great music and wondefully done, enjoyed it and made it easy to relive the movie<br />I would recommend this for anyone who saw the movie and liked it
B00884GR0W|3.0|ive been playing this awhile, but am getting tired of losing materials or having gear vanish after an update or fix.  please find a better way to preserve peoples work, before changing stuff.
1594481717|5.0|I bought the audio book on iTunes and loved it! Every chapter included crucial information regarding what it will take to succeed in the 21st century. Young adults (such as myself) will benefit most from this book because most of them are still stuck in the \\"left-brain\\" path of success from the information age that holds test scores, mathematical ability, and rigid rule-following in high regard. The next generation urgently needs to get more creative, open-minded, and \\"right-brained\\" if they want to succeed in the new age. Read this book, take notes, and get ready to dominate the conceptual age!
B003M696QS|4.0|For those who have an interest in this subject, this is a &#34;not to be missed&#34; explanation of the science involved in determining the validity of experiences had by individuals going through near death experiences.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I JUST FINISHED READING SACHI PARKERS TRULY INSPIRATIONAL BOOK. IT IS VERY SAD, FUNNY, TOTALLY ENLIGHTENING. THIS BOOKSPEAKS OF RAW AND HONEST HARD CORE TRUTH FROM THE SOUL. THIS BOOK IS  NO MOMMIE DEAREST... THIS BOOK IS GUT WRENCHINGLY HONEST. IF YOU ARE A SHIRLEY MACLAINE FAN, YOU MUST READ THIS STORY.  SACHI , I CRIED, AND CRIED THROUGHOUT YOUR TRUE AND HEARTBREAKING STORY. I WAS A TRUE SHIRLEY MACLAINE FAN. UP UNTIL YESTERDAY WHEN I STARTED READING THIS INCREDIBLE BOOK, THAT TOOK ME 81/2 HRS TO READ. I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THIS PAGE TURNER DOWN. IT IS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN FROM THE HEART AND SOUL. I DETEST SHIRLEY MACLAINE. I DON't  EVEN HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR HER AS AN ACTRESS ANYMORE. MS. MACLAINE CLAIMS THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION. I CALL HER A BOLD FACED LIAR. SHE IS ALSO F.....G CRAZY. READ THE BOOK, YOU WILL THEN UNDERSTAND WHY I MAKE THESE COMMENTS. EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A  HOLLYWOOD STAR, OR BETTER YET BE THE CHILD OF AN EXTORDINARY HOLLYWOOD STAR. THINK AGAIN!!! YOU JUST MIGHT GET WHAT YOU WISH FOR, AND WAKE UP IN A HOLLYWOOD NIGHTMARE, WITH YOUR MOTHER BEING SHIRLEY MACLAINE...... , A HOLLYWOOD  MADWOMAN.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Another great soundtrack from Howard Shore!  My only regret is the EXTREMELY shortened version of the Misty Mountains song. Other than that its a beautiful set of scores.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Not even considering the price, this is a great camera bag/pack. It has more than enough pockets/compartments to keep all your stuff. I've packed my strobes, lenses, batteries, flash meter, charger, shutter release, and still have room for more. It's even better at the price. Seems to be good quality construction. I highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had never heard of this game, but my kids were asking for it. It's definitely pricey compared to other apps, but they absolutely LOVE it! My daughter is 9 and my son just turned 6 and they both are able to play on their own and have a great time. Personally I don't understand what's so fascinating about it, but I bought it for them and am happy that I did!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I work the night shift at a jail, and finding things to do to stay awake and alert is not only necessary, it can sometimes be quite a challenge.  Lo & behold, Temple Run 2 became available for free (I'm a tightwad) for my Kindle Fire.  AWESOME GAME!!  It keeps me entertained during those long hours when the prisoners are sleeping and there's nothing else for me to do.  I highly recommend this game to anyone!
1878424777|5.0|This audio version is fantastic, I listen to it in the car and at home. Living life by these agreements helps me be a better man to everyone.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. There were times when I had to put it down because it dragged a few times in the middle. But it really was a great book. I would read it again.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille books are a mix of a great storyline and a wisecracking hero, and this one is classic. Well worth reading!
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Fun with lots of levels.  Lots if challenges.  Good value and boards and backgrounds easy to use to keep your interest
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I didn't realize this was a UK import because I was purchasing based on price. That said, there is an English menu option in addition to a few other options you don't normally have on US discs and the only other difference is the packaging. Great price for this trilogy and I would purchase other imports if the price was better than the US discs.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I enjoy the game play. I like being able to change the background scene and card backs. I don't like the commercials!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Compellingly delicious! A fantastic read can't wait for the next book..finally a good writer that knows her audience an character's well.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I saw this book advertised in a magazine and bought it.  It was a great story about what happens in Vegas.  Fast read.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|the game is pretty simple and fun! but the only thing that is bugging me is that you can't rotate anything. you guys need to fix that.over all I think its a great game!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I an a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and have read almost all of his books.  The setting is in a small town in North Carolina.  The story is fast moving and has a surprised ending I didn't see coming.  Can't wait to see the movie version.
0451205766|4.0|I was quiet fascinated with this book and I haven't seen the movie  hence thought of buying it. I must confess it was amazing experience to read this book, different from the kind of books I usually read. The making of don Vito is really interesting. Tom Hagen the intelligent and witty lawyer, the don himself the mastermind create the grip required to hold the reader. Kudos to the author!!!!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Quite simply. It is important for men to retain their manliness. This movie influenced me 13 years ago and now, 13 years later I can appreciate why.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i loved this trilogy, not only for the erotica sections but the entire story line itself! Very addicting, I had all 3 read in less than a week!
B000002H5I|3.0|Some of the songs aren't my cup of tea. I like some songs on her other cd's but I'm not sure I'll get it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Adam Makos's first book scored a winner and it obviously took a fantastic amount of research.  The book gives an excellent accounting of the German issues of the war.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|This is a good app for playing video and music, you can find your music or videos easily also. I like the feature that you can go into sources such as SDCARD.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I really loved this movie!! When I first heard about it, I was expecting something like an Iron Man 2.5. I AM SO GLAD TO BE WRONG!!! It has the perfect blend of figures, the story has very good pace and it shows the good and dark sides of all the characters. Great Loki, portrayed perfectly, and a great Iron man, Black Widow and Hulk. Love the Hellicarrier, a real treat for the fans. Great view and great buy
B007BFSYMS|4.0|We use this in our son's room to help with naps and he seems to love it. Thanks so much
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book.It was Easy to read and I couldnt put it down. Interesting topic and well written. Definately recommend.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Good decent movie with a very good storyline.  Being retired, my wife and I could relate very well to the characters portrayed.  Well written and well acted.
B005G02RIC|3.0|This was the my first Tosca experience at home. The opera itself is so great that it is basically impossible to hate it. And, in this particular performance, the image and acting are fine.<br /><br />Despite that, after watching this recording, I felt that something was not right. I then bought the DVD with Pavarotti and Verret. And my God, it all made sense! The image quality of Pavarotti's recording is, of course, not thrilling. But the singing and music are so much better that I could never play this Blu-ray again.<br /><br />Conclusion: nice experience for your eyes, but your ears will want more.
0307474259|1.0|Since you asked how I would rate this book, I would give it an even lesser &#34;star&#34; than shown.  This book is certainly not an easy one to read or follow.  I would never recommend anyone buying this book and regret that I did. It was written by a very intelligent man who could not get down to the average person's level.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Classic, fresh, soothing, solid,  smooth, beautiful vocals . his music is unmatched in this classical style pop CD. He good
B0097HSS4M|5.0|You don't have to be a professional photographer to use this app! It's such a good price too! DO NOT pass this offer up! This app is amazing!
B005LAII80|5.0|Highly recommended for action fans.<br />The blu ray has some pretty cool extras.<br />It showed up in great condition. Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This may be the best game out of temp temple run and angry granny run  because you get to duck longer and jump for a long we amount of time.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|It is light weight like it says , but its not as strong holding/ setting it up. Once you set it up , leave it , but otherwise I like the way it feels. Its not heavy , doesnt cover up any part of picture frame. The color is great , no one else has it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so good. I would of never believed it until I tried. I will recommend this app to anyone and everyone who is willing to listen.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I TOO DONT LIKE THE FACT OF STARTING COMPLETELYOVER WHEN YOU DONT FINISHA SEGMENT IN TIME.ITS NOT POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN ALL BE GOOD AT EVERY TYPE OF BRAINTEASER PUZZLETHAT GETS THROWNAT YOU.ALSO, I WOULD LIKE IF IT HADMORE STORY TO ITSO YOU HAVE A LITTLE WINDING DOWNINSTEAD OF PUZZLEAFTER PUZZLE AFTER PUZZLE.BUT STILL I LOVE BIG FISH GAMES SO I WILL KEEP GETTING THEM.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book so much cause you can actually read it and kinda have it play in your head like movie!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I remember watching this as a child and the songs always stuck with me. The music is perfect throughout and the color restoration is done perfectly. Great family night movie. I was glad to see this movie restored and recreated for blu-ray. These movies are hard to find once they are returned to the vault. Must See!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I rated this like I did because I think that it is a good dictionary.I LOVE IT SO MUCH....THANK YOU!!!!!;););):)
B002ZG98ZA|5.0|Sex & the City 2 needs no introduction! If you are a fan this second movie did not disappoint. This fashion is unbelievable. It makes you want to go shopping and get your closet in order! The ladies are phenomenon while taking you on this journey with them to Dubai. Although the ladies find themselves in much trouble they still remain humorous and glamorous throughout the film.
0307596885|4.0|Any reader who likes short stories will be rewarded with examples of the very best of this genre in a new collection from Alice Munro titled, Dear Life. Set in Ontario, Canada, each story reveals something essential about human behavior and the joy and heartbreak of life. The efficiency of this genre requires precision in language selection, and Munro is an expert. I savored and enjoyed each of the stories in this collection.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B0033AI41G|4.0|A Beautiful Mind gives a glimpse of the struggles people face with mental disorders. For the most part, most of them are not aware they suffer from such a disease of the mind. The world becomes complicated to them and its difficult to differentiate between the imagination and reality. I saw this movie a few years ago and once it was released on blu-ray I had to have it. I am a psychology major and this brought life to many of the disorders I have studied. This is a beautiful movie not only about the complexities of the mind but also about love. Although he was suffering from this uncontrollable disease his wife stood by him and nurtured him. Many people are not that lucky especially when an illness arise. I recommend this movie to people who are intrigued by what goes on in the mind of someone with schizophrenia and also to witness what true love can bring to a persons life.
B0016OLC5Q|3.0|Maybe it's because I read the book, but I don't think Penn (director) did a very good job with this one. Some realy nice cinematography... the Alaskan wilderness is stunning. But the movie just didn't capture the spirit of the main character. Worth a look if you're really interested, but if you're hoping for something as deep and thoughtful as the book, don't bother.
B008745B32|4.0|I haven't read it yet but it is on my list to be read in the future when I can.
B005544V6A|5.0|I think this is a great show. The world needs more people like Harvey Specter. Can't wait for season 3.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I've read all the Rebus books and this is one of my favourites.  Rebus is at his acerbic best here, wrestling with age and struggling to find a way, even in retirement, to continue the work that defines him.  Like all of Rankin's books, Standing in Another Man's Grave subtly explores a core human concern, in this case the secrets and lies that are all too often a core part of family life.  Usually detective series start to run out of steam after a while, but this is not true of the now numerous Rebus books.  Like Henning Mankel and Michael Connelly, Ranking's novels transend the often banal nature of the detective genre.  The only sad thing, is that despite the vast numbers of detective writers, very few even get close to Rankin's craft.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids love this movie.  It especially appeals to sensitive children, who worry about their impact on the world, of which both of mine are.  The movie encourages children to &#34;do the right thing&#34; and entertains them at the same time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Omg I love this book I didn't think I would like it but I did and now I recommend it and now headed for another book
B003UMW68Y|5.0|This movie has engaging characters, entertaining visuals, and addicting songs.  Have loved this movie for years and now sharing it with my children.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game it is fun and addicting. I enjoy it a lot more then most games I down load
B001DPHDCY|3.0|Though they loved another Dr. Seuss movie (The Lorax), my kids (girl 2 & boy 6) were not so into this one.  It was kind of slow.  Animation is great though.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's an okay game. I like running from the spectator. But it gets boring after a while. Being that all you do is get coins.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very addicting game. Good play most of the time, sometimes glitchy but no real complaints. Wish the objectives didn't jump so high so quickly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I find subway surfers as one of the best games that any mobile company has invented, and you also know that it is Awesome!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I bought this after hearing friends talking about it, wanting to see what the fuss was all about.. I could not put it down.
B0063M22QO|5.0|MAHJONG,  classic for all ages, keeps the mind sharp and serves as recreation as well.  Especially for travelling on long trips
B008B8DY2O|4.0|I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.  Well written, painting a vivid picture of India. Many thought provoking passages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute game!  My 5 year old loves this game.  She would stay on it all day if I would let her.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|I GOT THIS TODAY AND LISTENED TO ALL THE SONGS WITH THE VIDEOS . IF YOU LIKE PSYCHEDELIC COLORS WITH GREAT SOUND. THIS IS IT. THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC IS GREAT. THE LONGEST SONG IS DRIFTING BY WHICH IS ALMOST A HALF HOUR IF YOU CAN ENDURE IT. RAMADA INN IS GREAT.. SLEEPING LIKE A GIANT IS INTERESTING WITH THE WHISTLE IN THE SONG AND IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.. NEIL HAS A MESSAGE IN EACH OF THE SONGS ESPECIALLY WITH THE VIDEOS-. IF I COULD I GIVE IT 10 STARS I WOULD.. BUY IT YOU WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE CHECKING THIS OUT.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Having lived through my daughters eyes as she thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2009, I found this story compelling.  Everyone I've met who's done one of these 'soul searching'  hikes comes out of it a different person with a new appreciation for nature and their place in the natural world.  Cheryl Strayed has done a good job in this book of putting me in her shoes as she makes her way along this journey.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Being a veteran infantry Marine, I have trained for similar missions called Mout. The way the book was written, it felt like I was a member of the team!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I am a Tom Clancey nut and tend to devour everything I read of his - I can't put it down until it's done!  Once again, he did not disappoint me with this book.  His characters are like members of my family now.  To some, his writing may be a bit technical and he does tend to jump from one character and situation to another.  Yet it all comes to a thrilling conclusion and thank goodness, the good guys usually win and America is saved from destruction by John Clark, Jack Ryan, et al!
B002SRQ214|4.0|This CPU was quite the powerhouse in its day, but now it's considered low-end; however, it can power a $300 general-use build or a $450 gaming build very well.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Loved reg angry birds but now ad Star Wars yup yup very good stuff for sure. only now maybe they will make a Star Trek one and we will be complete
B008FYZIVY|5.0|i had been hearing about Downton Abbey from friends and now have caught up with the first 2 seasons. This Masterpiece Theatre series is excellent!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I spend a good deal of time playingthis game.<br />I often win.  It is good to play while watching TV
014241011X|5.0|great book its really cool and i&#34;d say its a book for ages 5 and up its so cute and you&#34;ll love roald dahl and the book!!!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Clint's character, Gus Lobel, evokes both irritation and sympathy as the reason for the seeming distance between him and his daughter, Mickey, played by Amy Adams, evolves.  And of course there's the romance edge as it is obvious from the beginning that Mickey's current boyfriend is all wrong for her. The storyline is so so predictable but nicely told and the casting was right which made it an enjoyable couple of hours.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good solid Solitaire game.  The only thing I would lkie to see is the addition of a few of the other versions of Solitaire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a fantastic  game!  The best feature is the new mines!  The green diamonds are also a great addition! Graphics are amazing!
1579128149|5.0|Saw this book at the Shop in the National Museum of Natural History.  Fell in love with it, but didn't want to pay the full MSRP.  Decided to wait (and control the impulse) until I got home. Well almost two years later I saw my Grandson had his own copy without any suggestions or prompting from me. I &#34;borrowed&#34; it for a week, but he wanted to take it home and I became sad. Xmas was good and I was able to purchase my own copy recently and now it resides on the coffee table. It does not belong on the book shelf. It must be seen daily to affirm the vastness and richness of our Universe. Who knows what it might do to our younger grand-kids (7 and 4). The book may well inspire them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My mom and I read it at the same time. Such a great story. Kept it interesting. Can't wait for the movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love it.  It has a lot of twist and turns and I love the zip lines.  looking forward to temple run 3!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|So sad that this child had to endure so much, yet so awesome she has the support system she does. Her view on her life ans what's happened to her is truly unbelievable. I don't think I could be so strong.
0061765236|5.0|this book was very well written! i loved it and would highly recommend to anyone! it was a great story line and is a fast read.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Jodi Piccoult makes you question yourself. Your beliefs and what you once thought was right and wrong. I have enjoyed every book that I've read. Warning, ending is totally different than the movie.
0307341550|5.0|i really enjoyed this book. its very interesting and a fast read. i would recommend it to anyone. it has an unusual story line!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Piccoult makes you question yourself. Your beliefs and what you once thought was right and wrong. I have enjoyed every book that I've read.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|Trying to get used to the 3D format. Starts off pretty easy but getting more complicated. Not sure if I l like it or not. It was free, so ok.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the first book and that was that. Such an awesome series. I was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised.
030758836X|4.0|This is another book that I couldn't put down!  The ending was completely unexpected and the whole book was extraordinary.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the whole series. I must admit I was afraid to even begin a book series like this but figured I'd try it out. No regrets here. Hated it had to end.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|There aren't many artists that I hear anymore and have to own their album but this is one of those.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the whole series. I must admit I was afraid to even begin a book series like this but figured I'd try it out. No regrets here. Hated it had to end.
B00A83075M|4.0|I went into the store to ask about the Wreck-It Ralph litho that usually comes with pre-orders, and the sales associate informed me that Disney will no longer being doing lithos. They tested with Peter Pan to see if the lithos affected sales, half the stores offering them with the pre-orders and the other half not. They found that the lithos do not affect sales.<br /><br />In my original review, I stated how Peter Pan was a poor choice to test this idea on. Not everyone owns bluray, so if you already have it on DVD, why bother getting it again? And if you already had the litho, you were even more less likely to buy because again, why pay for something you already have?<br /><br />I said that they should only do it with the new releases, like Wreck-It Ralph  to really see how it affects sales.<br /><br />I also stated that since Disney would no longer be doing the lithos, my family would no longer be pre-ordering the movies. Instead we would just wait until it came out and buy it on Amazon where it's usually a couple bucks cheaper.<br /><br />I also suggested a writing campaign to try and convince Disney to bring back the lithos; they're all we have for interior decorating in our house.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read the first book and that was that. Such an awesome series. I was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even with all the turns it is still the best show currently running on all the channels. Great story, acting, costumes ... everything.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I did not intend to get wrapped up in the vampire craze. I did not think I would be interested. Boy was I wrong. I cannot say enough about this series. Love all things twilight,
B005COO1X6|4.0|Enjoyed the book as usual for Stephen King.  I'm looking forward to his next book - what an amazing and creative mind.
B000002H5I|5.0|Cannot ever have enough of Tracy Chapman.  I will have to repeat this line over and over to fill in the necessary words to make this a review, eh Mr. Review Person
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very amusing and I really loved everything about it. I hope there will be a new book .  Hopefully there will be
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Why is Chris Pine given top billing here?  Although he is wonderful,  the entire show was he and Denzel.  The central office staff played excellent roles also.  Good family entertainment, no immorality overtones.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After I finished the 50 shades books, I was looking for another set of novels. I really love the Crossfire novels. I great read. Can not wait until the third comes out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you think the first temple run is fun, you are definitely missing out! Temple Run 2 is waaay better! Better graphics, better terrain, BETTER EVERYTHING!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|THIS IS A SERIES OF BOOKS THAT DEMANDS YOUR TIME. RICHARD AND KAHLAN ARE SUCH DYANAMIC CHARACTERS AND THE STORY IS SO GOOD IT IS HARD TO STOP READING FOR ANY REASON. HOPE A TORNADO DOES NOT COME, I WILL BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE
B0010T0JBA|5.0|Excelente producto, hice mi compra desde Venezuela y estoy totalmente satisfecho con mi compra. Recomiendo esta tienda con totalidad y al 100%
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander's account of his experience<br />during comma is unusual and eye opening.I<br />I wish there were more books like this.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|This is the second time I have bought this item, and while it is not fine Italian crafted leatherwork, it at least did the job, especially with it's clip and magnetic closure, both adding to its convenience. Now it has neither, and is simply worthless except to protect the bluetooth within a larger bag. Not worth it.
0894803123|5.0|I bought this book several years ago after I got a new ice cream maker.  I didn't like the taste of the \\"packet\\" you could buy to use with it, so I went searching on Amazon for something better.  I came up with 2 different books that I bought, this one soon became my \\"go to\\" book, and the other ended up never being used.  There hasn't been anything in this book that I made that we didn't like (and I've made just about everything in here!).  One of the great things I love is that by using these recipes you start to get a base idea of how it's done and can experiment using the base cream recipies (I made an amazing pumpkin spice one for Thanksgiving by playing around with the base cream). One tip I have come up with though is to use an electric mixer to whip your eggs and sugar with...this helps to pull more air into the ice cream and makes for a better set in the freezer (when I did it by hand would freeze almost rock hard, by using mixer it has more of a store set to it, firm, but soft enough to scoop.).<br />Over all this is the best book for ice cream making!!!
B0093X80VQ|5.0|I read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and wanted to read the next one.  Both were such fun to read..
B005LAII80|5.0|More true to the comic books, gritty, violent, and intense action sequences. A good action movie with well done 3-D and well acted by Urban, Headey, and Thirlby.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game and so does my little sister. I just started playing about an hour ago and I'm already hooked! It does have one problem though. When they're teaching you how to play it gets a little bit confusing. Try and remember what they tell you because they'll only tell you once. Do that and you should be fine.
B009R89AA2|3.0|Great book but some of the words run over each other...<br />It's probably just a mistake in the kindle edition.<br />A really good book though-really funny!
B004I744AS|4.0|very easy to use.  best dictionary app I have come across. I have no problems with this app.  I told my sister about it and she likes it too.  anyone needing a dictionary this is the one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was such a nice follow up to the first in the series.  I can't wait for the next book!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Purchased for another party - They are happy with the CD but did not wish to provide a detailed review.  Probuct was delivered on time in good condition
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!!  It isn't as hard core as 50 shades but the story and relationships are divine ?
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I can safely say that the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; series are the most boring books I've ever read. Haven't bothered with &#34;Freed&#34;  I think it's a case of the &#34;Emperors New Clothes&#34; There's been so much hype about the series that women are frightened to say they find it utterly boring and total rubbish.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Can't believe a couple can take so long to come together and still seem so fully connected. I enjoyed their story so much and was glad it continued into Point of Retreat....
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Well, I read several reviews before purchasing this case and my experience with the case is slightly different.<br />First, I have an I-phone 4s. The plastic screen protector does not lay smoothly on the phone.<br />Second, it makes pushing the buttons on the side of the phone difficult.<br />Third, the only charger that works is the one that comes w/ the phone. All others are to big to fit the slot in the case.<br />Fourth, I've heard from several people that it's hard to hear me or I sound muffled.<br />Last, the case distorts the flash on the phone for pictures.<br />If you can deal with these things then this case is for you. Personally, none of these really bother me so I'll keep the case. The amount of protection is worth it and its not super bulky like the other cases.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show was recommended to me and I was told that I really needed to watch it from the beginning...Well I got the first two seasons and watched 1 and sometimes 2 episodes each night. I loved watching in on my kindle with the headphones on as the music sounds so wonderful that way. Well long story short, I'm hooked. I have gone through the first two seasons in no time and now I have to wait a week between each episode. I love this show!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been playing this game since last night and only stopped to write this review and charge my kindle so mu h fun
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is pretty fun... we are just getting started and we are enjoying it.  Does seem a lot like super Mario bros.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It is a little confusing, but I think it is pretty good if you don't have a dictionary. I like it...
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is an extremely good product; it works as advertised; it works very well; it is very easy to use;
B007M45PMU|5.0|It's a great album. I have been enjoying all of the tracks, even the ones not played on the radio.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|It worked well. I just wish the picture was a little bigger.  It was hard to see exactye what the slide showed
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I heard the cut &#34;Freedom&#34; on NPR by Anthony  Hamilton and Elanya Bolton :bought soundtrack immediately.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino's soundtracks are universally renowned for his quirky combinations,and this does not disappoint, but rather, is his best, surpassing &#34;Resovoir Dogs&#34;,for it's originality and collection of diverse genres that merge into a cohesive collection that makes sense...and I have not seen the movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book leaves you feeling happy and sad, joy and sorrow. So many different feelings. Some things left unattended which makes it hard to swallow. Nothing worse than a character you've come to know so well, simply be done. Maybe it's the flaws of certain characters but I am left feeling unfulfilled. Nothing uplifting about how this tragic dystopian trilogy ended. Very real in the lack of positive ending.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|Bobbi always shares such great tips and information. A great book for anyone interested in makeup. I really lie Bobbi's easy approach.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|The perceived formations the story takes you are exciting and very self evoking.<br />the delight and sadness I found in Pi and his ideas and adventure are still haunting.<br />A practical way of dealing with life shows the wonderful storytelling  of the author.
0345528581|5.0|Some of the exercises described in this book must be for fakirs, or contortionists, or young military recruits. Either way, it does present great ideas about calisthenic workouts and how to get a great pump on a very limited budget. A must have for every fan of body weight exercises!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is sorta like owning a horse and I love it this is the greatest game I've ever played In my whole entire life
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The acting is amazing.  The show is fun and young at heart.  It is a show that both young and old can enjoy.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|After some use the black flap doesn't work properly as a stand. Other than that it a nice product. That's why I gave it 3 stars
B0027MJU00|4.0|I chose to read Gillian Flynn's early works before trying Gone Girl and I was not disappointed.  Dark Places had great characters, an interesting way of presenting a story, and a suspensful plot.  The story was written in present day with flashback chapters.  It didn't just focus on Libby Day, the protagonist of the book, it also was written from the brother and mother's point of view.  The ending was quite the twist and it was a great read.  I read it on my lunch breaks and was upset after my thirty minutes were up and I had to stop.  I am currently reading Sharp Objects and then will move on to her most recent Gone Girl.  This is a great book, especially if you are looking to try a new author.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|i loved it ,i haven't seen the movie but the book is amazing.finally one of my favorites now. Read it, you'll thank me later.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down, it was very good!!  The ending was a surprise, but the way it should have ended!
B00AMHFMIG|4.0|I admit I started watching for Courteney Cox, since I was a big fan of \\"Freinds\\". I was pleasantly surprised to see Christa Miller (from \\"Drew Carey\\") and Busy Phillips (from \\"Dawson's Creek\\") as well.<br /><br />The first few episodes leave a lot to be desired, but after that it turns into an amazing series that is great to watch with that someone special.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|After the beautiful but minimalist &#34;Illuminations&#34;, &#34;All that Echoes&#34; finds Groban going back to familiar territory while at the same time expanding his musical repertoire.<br />Once again, Josh shows off his songwriting chops, co- writing all of the albums original songs.  While,&#34;Brave&#34; and 'E Ti Promitero,&#34; ere a bit on the predictable side, Groban more than makes up for it with the thumping &#34; False Alarms,&#34; and the groovy &#34; Below the Line,&#34;<br />Other standouts on the album include. &#34; Hollow Talk&#34; , &#34; She Moves Through The Fair&#34;, &#34; The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,&#34; and Josh's surprisingly soulful take on Stevie Wonder's, &#34; I Believe,&#34;<br />Vocally Josh is at his best and the songs on this album do a great job of showcasing his powerful baritone voice. He also does a great job of integrating falsetto into his singing, something that he's struggled with in the past. This is most evident in his cover of &#34;Satelite,&#34; which is unfortunately only available on the Target Edition.<br />All in all, I found &#34; All that Echoes,&#34;to be a wonderful album that shows Josh's continued growth as both a singer and songwriter and recommend it to all of his fans.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Love the light, longer battery life, and the so-called tactical tail cap switch.<br />Installing the new bulb is a bit fussy.<br />The kit is pricy so it makes economic sense if you have an old AA Mini-Mag laying around.
B00103584Y|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it.  It's fast paced with a great techno soundtrack.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat with its captivating story line and built-in love story.

B00A80SHFM|1.0|I just listened to a copy from the Library. Then I listened to a budget copy I have. This soundtrack has low production values, indifferent emotion, sup par mixing, and sounds like it was recorded in a studio then duped in. You just can't perform Les Miserables and sing so detached from the roll you're performing. The Master of the House is boring and it is my favorite song. Very flat performance over all. Enter 625282100387 in music you will find a Timothy Parks Productions for $6 new. Not as good as the PBS TV production but has far more emotion then this Soundtrack. I should not have listened to this because now I have no interest in the movie. Now where is my PBS DVD of Les Miserables? I need a fix.
1932100660|5.0|It was a fairly long but interesting book.  Seems personal and honest. Not selling anything.  Two great bits of advice; eating vegetables never killed anyone.  and second bit of advice  Eat plants.  I am now a vegan for about one and a half years and I felt it helped me through chemo therapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplant and immunosupressive drugs.

B00004RF9B|5.0|Robbie the robot - this robot has been used in so many other shows.  The movie also gives some background into human mind.  Id, ego and super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described. According to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the ego is the organized, realistic part; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role The super-ego can stop you from doing certain things that your id may want you to do.

B0076DELIG|2.0|I'm a big fan of Connelly and especially Harry Bosch, but this is an uninteresting, predictable book.<br /><br />A must read if someone gives it to you, but only if you're stuck in bed with a broken leg and broken TV..
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. It is a good way to waste time. It reminds me somewhat of that Zoo Tycoon game. That was one of my favourite games as a kid.

B009HOU672|5.0|I have several renditions of The Four Seasons and would not part with any one of them. However, this new look at the basic , structural beauty at the foundation of these concerti is captivating. You will be drawn, irremovably, into the work by Max's beautiful preamble, Spring 0.<br /><br />I can only hope that Max chooses to similarly &#34;recompose&#34; other masterpieces with the same result.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I originally bought these headsets for listening to my TV programing late at night & gaming on my PS3. Based on reviews from other users that said they were able to make this work with their smart TV and PS3, I purchased it. When I got these headsets I was not able to make it work with my PS3 or my TV so I called Logitech & they informed me these headsets are only meant for computer gaming. Why couldn't they build a headphones that's compatible with more than one device? They're charging us a fair bit of money for these headsets so why does it have so many limitations? I feel like this is a total ripoff because it has too many limitations for the price. I even asked Logitech if there was any work around so I could get this to work with my TV but they said no as there was no way to install the driver for this headset on the TV. A pair of ''gaming'' headset that is not compatible with PS3 or XBOX that's some BS! I guess people that are only into computer gaming this will work out fine, but that's the only thing it will do besides listening to music on your computer.

B0011TMOIK|5.0|I really enjoyed all the movies in the Harry Potter series.  This is the second movie in the series and I think  it was just as good as the first. I would recommend it to anyone.  I didn't read any of the Harry Potter books, but still enjoyed the movie.  They take you away from reality for a while
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is so  amazing love the inspiration the protagonist gives forth. It's so DOPE the ending is my favorite part and I felt moved and happy. Usually I hate finishing books makes me sad but this one made me joyful.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater when it was released, and was so greatful to find this special edition for sale. All the memories came flooding back to me, with all the great music. The edition will be a great addition to your Dvd collection, so you can revisit it anytime you like, you will not forget how it changed your life and the world.
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|For a guy in his mid-70s, this is an impressive live blues CD.  He's one of the last of the great blues  guitarists, and we've gotta treasure him while we have him.<br /><br />There are some good songs on this CD.  Best Damn Fool, Skin Deep, another version of Damn Right I Got the Blues with some audience participation.  It's worth downloading these few songs.  There are a couple of studio recordings Polka Dot Blues (which is basically just a remake of many slow blues songs with new lyrics) and Coming for You and Country Boy.  On these songs Buddy's hard picking sounds just like the old days.  Then there are some so-so songs.  I Just Wanna Make Love to You uses the rhythm of The Dollar Done Fell from the Live at the Checkerboard Lounge CD (which is much better than this).  He should have just played Dollar Done Fell.  Other covers Mannish Boy, John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom, Strange Brew - these are good songs; I think I'll go listen to the originals.<br /><br />There is something that disturbs me deeply on this CD, and it has nothing to do with the lyrics.  Buddy plays a few verses of John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom introducing it as how blues were played before the British got a hold of it.  Then he plays a couple of verses from Strange Brew to attempt to demonstrate how the music changed after the British got ahold of it.  But the lead guitar on Strange Brew was an imitation of Albert King's Born Under a Bad Sign.  In fact, most of the licks on Strange Brew were direct rip-offs from that song.  Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" album was a breakthrough album and influenced people from Clapton to SRV to guys in Argentina and Europe.  To give credit for Albert King's innovation to the British (or anyone other than the late great Albert King) disgusts me.  SRV copied some of Albert King's licks note for note also.  A lot of people did that, and it's a tribute to Albert King's creativity.  I don't object to Clapton copying Albert King.  Albert King was probably flattered.  But neither Clapton nor any other Brit created that style.  Buddy Guy isn't just some no-name guy with a big mouth.  He's Buddy Guy.  And he should be more careful with what he says and who he gives credit to because a lot of people respect him, and it perpetuates a myth and takes away credit where credit is certainly due.d.

B008NW67E0|5.0|It took me a while before realizing this album was spectacular.  Unlike the vast-majority of sophomore efforts, they embraced the sound that got them here.  If you haven't seen them live...  do yourself a favor!!!<br /><br />Favorites: (in the order they occur on the album)<br />-Babel<br />-I Will Wait<br />-Lover of the Light<br />-Below my feet<br />-Where are you now
1616550414|5.0|i pre-ordered this book for my little sister's birthday, KNOWING she would love it. and it arrived only days after it was released, well in time for her birthday. HUGE book, SO MANY illustrations.. overall, great value.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book couldn't put it down... recommend it to anyone who's loved and lost. Dealt with tragedy and accepted it. Great book
B00006879E|5.0|I love all the songs on this CD.  It does have very sexy music.  I am not a Maroon 5 fan particular but I do love the songs &#34;She Will be Loved&#34;.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book is a young person's book, romance and hormones.  It turns and goes back in time, the reader doesn't know what is happening, until way later on.  I enjoyed it, an easy read.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|What can I say the Winchester boys never disappoint.  This show is on it's 8th year and it is still going strong.  Amazing and unique story lines.  Great action keeps you coming back for more. What I love about this show is that it has all the elements you are looking for in a great show -it's action packed but can be sad, dramatic or humorous. They execute some of the funniest lines that make you hit rewind so you can laugh even harder.  The actors who play Dean and Sam have great chemistry. You really believe they are brothers with all their bickering and bantering but most of all on how they protect each other.  This show is so good even the Villians are endearing like Benny the Vampire. You find yourself rooting for him to survive. I recommend this show to anyone who likes to watch shows with supernatural story lines.  You will not be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I cannot get enough of this book. It was great. Engaging and simply breathtaking. Looking forward to book two. Loved it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Firefly was a show that I knew I loved within seconds of starting the first episode...and when it ended all too soon, I was quite broken hearted. I am so glad that Joss Whedon was able to bring back the beloved characters from Firefly in this fantastic movie. I just wish there was more...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very compelling and I would have never guess the ending just a very good read indeed. The story was all persons and I look forward to city of ashes

1591841666|5.0|Winners never quit right? Well sometimes they do, but only at things that will hold them back from being more successful.<br /><br />Have you ever felt that something is just not worth going on with and it is time to look in a different direction? Well that is called the \\"dip\\" and if you aren't careful you could get stuck in the \\"cul-de-sac\\" of life with no significant advancement in any direction.<br /><br />So what should you quit and what should you stick to? That is up to you but reading this book will help you make those crucial decisions.<br /><br />Seth Godin's books are always catchy, \\"un-put-down-able\\" and this one is no different. Short and sweet you can get a lot of bang out of this quick read.<br /><br />Todd Millar, Glenn Simon Inc.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I told all of my friends about how exciting it was to read this book, I just had a hard time putting my kindle down to go to work
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I bought this video and Leisa Hart's Fitmama at the same time. This one is far better if you had an established exercise regime before you became pregnant. It's a good workout! I would keep doing it even if I wasn't pregnant but couldn't go to the gym. You certainly feel like you are doing something with this video, whereas with Fitmama it seems like a warm up or cool down video. I strongly recommend you get it IF you were an avid exerciser before.<br /><br />When I hit my third trimester it was hard sometimes then I only did 25 minutes of the 40 minute workout. The ground work portion gave me incredible heartburn so I usually stopped before that and went for a walk.<br /><br />The partner exercise is ok to try once and I did get a great workout but I didn't feel it was necessary.<br /><br />Danielle Millar, Glenn Simon Inc.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a great example of people uprising and challenging their government. I gave this book a 5 stars .
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love the story line and the way in which the characters lives are interwoven into this captivating series.  The characters are set in the 1920's in England and their personalities and performances are absolutely stunning.  The relationship between those who are of the aristocracy and their servants who live and work downstairs is touching and speaks to how we are all interdependant on each other for love, understanding, support, etc.
B0031RS42A|5.0|A must read for anyone that likes mysteries! Holmes never bores and the story lengths are perfect at keeping the reader constantly engaged.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first two books, but this last effort seemed lazy. The book tries to repeat the same formula that worked in the first two books, but it gets old and very unrealistic. Ending was unsatisfying.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|This book may have been written with me in mind. The irritating barrenness of most positive thinking and self-help hogwash has always seemed not just banal but actively damaging. This book beats all hell out of that trap!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book was more of the same as the 1st two books.  I was already to the point of skipping over the intimate parts because it seemed like it was just filler.  (Like too much breading in a crab cake.) Too much of the same stuff.  The different parts  of this book could have been added to Book 2 and saved me money from buying this one.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|This movie is not a suspense movie as the trailers made it out to be.  This movie is about a drunk who crashed a plane.
B0053FANRC|5.0|This is my son's favorite movie so I bought him several copies for christmas. A fast action-packed movie that keeps going faster and faster.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a typical Nicholas Sparks. Not a lot of meat or twists to the plot, but a good read.  He takes big topics like spousal abuse and makes you think about them without too much emotionalism. I really enjoyed the book!
B0025TOH5S|4.0|If you like good clean entertainment, than this is the movie for you.  Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin are the best!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Simply one of the best movies there is. Unbelievable. I've already see it twice and can go for a third. You will love this purchase.

B001DSNF8C|3.0|This is how \\"Casino Royale\\" should have happened.<br /><br />(M and Bond are at Alex Dimitrios' beach villa after he prevented the plane bombing)<br /><br />M: Bond, thanks to you, you have prevented the bombing of the Skyfleet airliner and LeChiffre has lost all his money, including millions of dollars in terrorist funding. And now we know exactly where he is and when and where he's going to be.<br /><br />Bond: Great, let's go arrest him immediately then, shall we?<br /><br />M: Not yet. In order to recoup his clients' money, LeChiffre is staging a high stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. We need you to compete in the tournament and prevent LeChiffre from winning.<br /><br />Bond: So let me get this straight, you want me to play cards against this guy?<br /><br />M: Yes.<br /><br />Bond: Okay...is the tournament going to be rigged in our favor?<br /><br />M: No, you MUST win fair & square. And if he wins, then we'll have DIRECTLY financed international terrorism!<br /><br />Bond: I don't understand, we know he's guilty, do we not?<br /><br />M: Yes.<br /><br />Bond: Does the poker tournament make him more guilty or something?<br /><br />M: No, but if he loses, he'll be completely out of money and desperate for protection against his creditors and terrorist clients, and have no choice but to come to us and tell us everything he knows.<br /><br />Bond: But you just said the reason for LeChiffre's poker tournament is because he's completely out of money now. Is he not? I don't understand why we should do this if it proves nothing and could potentially give LeChiffre back his power if he wins.<br /><br />M: Listen to me, you'll going to Montenegro. We'll send Vesper along to help you, a woman who does not know how to defend herself and who also never had a thorough background check done on her. And while you're there, African warlords are going to try and kill you both. If you kill them, don't worry, because we'll stuff the dead bodies in someone's car and frame him for murder. And if LeChiffre tries to poison you, we'll have an expensive car waiting outside for you with a defibrillator. And after you win the tournament, you should try to avoid getting captured by LeChiffre, for he has a penchant for smashing his male victim's testicles. And hopefully no one will kill LeChiffre, because if he dies we'll be right to where we started...except for your testicles.<br /><br />Bond: Forgive me ma'am, but this sounds like a horrible idea.<br /><br />M: Fine! We'll do it the boring way.<br /><br />(Bond and a squad of MI-6 agents arrest LeChiffre and bring him back to England)<br /><br />LeChiffre: I'll never tell you anything! NEVER!<br /><br />Bond: Do you really want to go back out there and be sliced and diced by your clients?<br /><br />LeChiffre: Okay fine, here's what I know.<br /><br />By the way, the American, German, and British blu-rays are censored. The American release of \\"Casino Royale\\" censored a lot of violence throughout the film. The total cuts amount to a few frames per violent scene, adding up to about 30 seconds. Among the censored scenes are the bathroom fight between Bond and the contact and the stairwell fight between Bond and the African warlords. The UK version cut some of the torture scene and the German version cuts a scene where the plane bomber snaps a guy's neck. I recommend buying the Australian, Dutch, French, Hong Kong, Japanese, Russian, and Scandinavian Blu-rays and DVDs.<br /><br />*update: Apparently, there's been a British re-release of \\"Casino Royale\\" with a BBFC rating of 15 and it contains the uncut version of the film.
B0041O40EI|5.0|Great project but had to reurn because I found it was a duplicate. I do, however, highly recommend this puzzle.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Yes, this amazing cooler lowered my processor temperature by 114 degrees. I run an i5-2400, sandy bridge 1155 processor. The day before I installed this product I took apart my stock Intel i5 heatsink and re-applied some heat sink grease. Even with fresh grease the processor temperature was 99* Celsius (210 DEGREES F!) under load. Today after installing this new heat sink and running a very processor intensive game for 5+ hours my top temperature topped out at 36* Celsius (96 DEGREES!).<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product.

B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Lord Spielberg has really topped himself with this thoroughly engrossing cinematic experience. I have seen this magnificent work of art on numerous occasions. When I want to be taken back in time this is worth my investment for many, many reasons. I have a strange gene within that is totally fascinated by man's inhumanity to man. Having traveled to Austria and Germany, I have seen a couple of former concentration camps, I believe Dachau was one that has eerily been transformed into a suburban neighborhood. I think with \\"The Color Purple\\" and \\"Schindler's List\\", Mr. Spielberg is without a peer. Both of those movies, \\"Schindler's List\\" being far more graphic, demonstrate how there exist this near unexplainable cruelty that permeates a few inhumane claymation subbing as human. To this day, I have deep issues of ever returning to Germany again or any of our southern states. Sure it can be said that was a different time and place. But the energy of those demented souls still fly like philistines in our world. I recommend you try reading a book, \\"Political Ponerology\\" that focuses on people like bush, cheney and the entire neo-nazi figures of today.<br />I will say if you have ever seen The Shoah Foundation's documentary \\"The Last Days\\", there is a near note by note rebuttal discrediting the accuracy of that documentary. Some bitter, non-holocaust believer actually assembled contrasting footage and interviews that seriously makes you reevaluate \\"Schindler's List\\". I find most holocaust deniers as dark, vindictive souls. But, if you go to YouTube and put in rebuttal to \\"The Last Days\\" you can draw your own conclusion.<br />I recently put myself through watching Leni Reifensthal's \\"The Triumph of the Will\\", hitler's ultimate propaganda piece. I just can never make peace with an entire country recklessly adhering to hitler's evil agenda to \\"cleanse\\" the German race. \\"Schindler's List\\" does offer the contrast in Oskar Schindler's humanity.<br />This is easily my 4th copy of \\"Schindler's List\\". Though I have seen this epic work nearly 30xs, I almost inevitably find or hear something I may not have heard before. I am hoping the Blu-Ray disc offers another revelation.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This is the second best book I ever read.Jeff Kinney is a wonderful author.He has written other wonderful books.Most of his books are very funny.PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|very good reading.  He describes dying and heaven different than anything I've heard before.<br />I recommend it, buy it today.
0802473156|5.0|I like the book because of the principles behind it, you might not be relating to the one you love in the right way and it opens your eyes to explore other avenues of expressing and receiving love.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game to pass the time! Would recommend it to any fan of the show. The gems are a pain to get though.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had a tough time getting in to this book.  The first half of the book was tedious to say the least.  However, friends assured me it was worth continuing on.  They were right, once I got to a pivotal point in the plot I was hooked!  The twists and turns in the plot made it hard to put down.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a great game mostly because of how addicted I am to this game. I subtracted a star because it's pretty hard to get acorns. I would totally get this game if I were you.
0670290742|1.0|The book &#34; 84, Charing Cross Road&#34;shipped was supposed to be new.. It was not.  Maybe on shelf a long time so it looked very old and used.<br /><br />Recommend the book itself to no one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a fast read that keeps your attention with interesting turns. Would recommend this book to my friends.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett seems to have captured (as he did in Pillars of the Earth) the lives of the people of Kingsbridge - their struggles, conflicts, motives, imperfections - set against the backdrop of the major events of the time.  As in Pillars of the Earth, their stories have the ring of truth.  Follett also captures the conflict of good and evil, which is a major and enjoyable element of so many good stories.  Not quite as good as Pillars of the Earth, but it is still one of the best historical novels I've ever read, and I couldn't give it less than five stars.
B0015AARJI|5.0|todo sin contratiempos , exelente vendedor la entrega fue magnifica y a tiempo es de muy buena calidad  saludos desde valencia venezuela
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Very time consuming, and it can charge you to buy the credits, don't press accept. You can still play this game for free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|__i love the game its awesome  hahahahaahaha i really like this game only doing this for gems  this really sucks talkking about review
B00AJJV3W6|5.0|I wanted to throw in a quick little review here on this release. This IS a new digital 2012 remaster from the UK's Rock Candy label. This disc sounds great. The separation of the guitars is excellent. There's no muffled sound here like the old CD's used to sound. The levels are just right also. Not too loud, not too suppressed. If you're reading this, then you must like the Outlaws. Get this.<br /><br />Rock Candy remasters many older artists. You'd be surprised as to who they have done (like the first 4 Eddie Money discs).
0770433782|5.0|Very helpful book with great tips and advice! Ton of pictures and ideas - I highly recommend this book if a bride is needing some inspiration for her wedding!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is one of the best ive seen. I love it. for all horse lovers! a good app for all ages!
B002DD67XG|5.0|Loved all of Taylor's renditions on this CD.  There is a song for everyone to relate to and each brings its own special message.  They are all soothing and very moving in that unique James Taylor way.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I keep tabs on family in a few cities back east and routinely check their weather prior to calling.  I also work in the construction industry in So Cal and the weather has an impact on productivity.  I relly enjoy using this app.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian McEwan is such a fine writer who never fails to give us layered plots.  While not as outstanding as his &#34;Atonement&#34;, it is none the less a good read and keeps the reader involved all the way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a very intimidating book. Not one I thought I would ever read. But I'm glad I did. It is amazing. I would expect many others to start yet it. You'd be amazed how much you enjoy it. I'm buying the next as we speak.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was fantastic until I reached the end. The two points of view were excellent writing.  I think it needs a better ending. There was this buildup and then a let down at the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because I love temple run but this game is more fun than temple run and this game is just like terr mole run so I suggest you download.thank you for reading
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 5 year old son loves this game. He plays with it every day and it keeps him busy for hours.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Another great book by Jeff Kinney. The beginning was very good but the end I started dozing off. I still loved it though.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My 3rd child and the 1st pacifier that we successfully used. They are a little pricey but my baby will take it & the animals attached are adorable! We received the 1st one as a gift & have purchased 3 more. My baby can easily grasp the animals and play with it. I find it spends less time on the floor or getting lost because it's easier to hold.
B002AF4Y9G|5.0|Best movie Oliver stone ever made....PERIOD. I went to wal mart to buy fear and loathing in las Vegas and bought this instead...definitely worth. It
1423140605|5.0|I love Riordan books I love all his series and wish he could write even more books. Everything I expected
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I rely like the game it's a lot of fun to play. I love the game. I'm rely happy the game was made.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Great game with no glitches experienced. I got this one after the last Angry Birds.  The fact that it was free was a big plus.  The ads were not a bother.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love The Product, It's A Great Game :)) I love  the subway surfer game. It's so exciting to pla
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A remarkable story - to say more will spoil your experience. If you've ever wondered about your life purpose please watch this story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this is an amazing game. I highly reccomend it. Its a great game for anyone who likes the first temple run.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've been saying that scientist have messed with our food for 20 years! Now because a doctor wrote a book many more people will listen and stop the Frankenfood.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not as good as the first, it kinda drags through some parts in the middle, but still a good book
B0018RWD1S|5.0|Great album, its really enjoyable. High respects to her as an artist, RIP. Worth my buy to own an actual CD and not just a download. Im 21 and will probably continue to listen to her throughout the rest of my life.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|Product is well made and offers protection for me e-reader.  It is slightly larger than the Kobo requires, but it does work for both Kindle and Kobo.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I missed this season while it was aired in fall and needed to catch up before it starts this coming Sunday. Definitely worth buying! You save 20 bucks by using amazon video. And you can stream it from your ps3 or other devices if you have them! This season is gruesome and has a lot of emotion. If you like the walking dead and saving money, buy this!
B008X9Z4I8|4.0|Despite reading it works only for the Kindle, it does work for the smaller Kobo reader.  Protects the e-reader well
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This is a movie that touched on the very complicated situation of high school particularly from the view point of a mentally ill kid.<br />I found it both inspiring and depressing at different intervals, and I believe that anyone who had a tough high school life will be able to relate to a certain extent.<br />Overall, I loved it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is very fun and very addicting.  Basically you are this little guy and you have to collect tokens, avoid obstacles, etc.  You sometimes collect different suits which give various abilities.  You can upgrade your character and vehicles as you play.  Very fun.
0345536886|1.0|As a retired trial lawyer I normally eat up Mr. Grisham's work.  Where normally the pages turn by themselves until the wee hours every night, I had to keep after myself just to continue reading it.  This must be one of those novels that authors have to write under a contract with the publisher to produce X number of novels per year or whatever.  It's just silly and unbelievable.  Worse yet, there is no character who is particularly likable, at least not so likable that one cares enough to slog through the silliness to see how it all comes out for him or her.  I began to have difficulty with credibility when the plaintiffs lawyers filed suit without an expert opinion on their side. But every shred of credibility departed the effort for me when SPOILER ALERT the Judge dismissed Alisandros.  There is absolutely no way in the world that a Federal Judge would have allowed a good tort lawyer to withdraw from the case on the eve of trial.  Doesn't happen in real life, especially when the result is the mess the Judge would have had to have expected with his courtroom in the hands of an ambulance chaser with no trial experience; it is no better than contrivance to have required Wally and David to proceed to trial.<br /><br />The novel wraps it all up neatly with David, a/k/a Mr. Clean, compelling the firm to avoid shoddy practices like ambulance chasing, signs on bus benches and in \\"cheap publications\\" and the like.  The firm is going to be proud to be a good, solid, silk-stocking firm.  And yet SPOILER ALERT David mysteriously signs up and settles several lead poisoning cases, presumably from the list of offenders the manufacturer gave him.  Query:  How did David get those cases if he was prohibited from advertising for them?<br /><br />Reading this one is better actually than being in the hospital with nothing to do, and much better than being in a car crash in South Chicago outside the office of Finley, Figg & Zinc, but beyond that, meh.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This app kept us amused during a 4 day power outage on my tablet.  It is fun and challenging.  I really enjoy the jedi like actions the birds have in this one. LOL
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Must see movie!!! this romantic comedy will make you laugh and cry! Every married couple should watch this movie! One of my favorites year!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's Kindle, what can you say?  Works beautifully every time.  I prefer to use this as the default reader on my nexus 7.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This was a gift. They loved the series on TV, loved it, therefore this is what they wanted and very pleased. It arrived on time, in good condition. Would buy from this seller again.
B009CG2YDE|1.0|I didn't find this to be worth the hard drive space on my tablet.  Deleted it very soon after downloading.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|very well made movie that was funny and very touching at the end. a good story about how we all deserve love and that it is out there fro everyone

0321344758|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone choosing a projector and wants lots of brightness. This lamp provides a very bright image on the screen.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game is pretty fun i love playing it! i like that u can pick new horses but its hard to get gems
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was fun and challanging, with an entertaining story.  I will get more G5 games in the future
B00B0NDF26|4.0|Really good.  Not a 4 star album per Rollingstone magazine.  Weird though that a lot of the songs sound like they are from the early 80's with the synthesizers and what not.  I paid $5 for the download.  It's definitely a $15 album!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Harry and I love Michael Connelly for bringing him to the readers. Great story. Harry at his best.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it is all was gives me up to dates and bad weather coming I think people should get this app
B00633W614|4.0|This is the second in the series. Only Time Will Tell is the first and it left me hanging. So without this next one available I would not know what was to happen. I am now anticipating the final in the series due out soon. Sins OfOur Fathers left me with enough information that I could wait for the last book. However, the first &#34;Only&#34; did not. It was an excellent read. Love this series that my sister recommended to me.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen has yet to let me down.  I was introduced to her with Northanger Abbey and was pleasantly surprised with the humor; this book had humor of the same type but it was refreshing to see it coming from a female protagonist. Two thumbs up (and more if I had them!)
B004SOR4H6|5.0|We chose this rating because it's allowed us to have 24/7 contact with all our friends and loved ones, including our friends in Ireland and England.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I. thoght. it. was. fake  money  but. its.<br /> real. money. I  hate. this. game. because. it.  has  real. money in.  it. Its  not.  great. Its. anoying.
B003RV23KE|5.0|Awsome movie was kind of faithfull to the original but with its own twist good effects and great sound effects.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game.<br />Very interesting and intriguing take care of your own horse when you can't have one.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Not much for words so I'll make it simple the movie was freaking great plenty of action a few twists and a whole lot of bang for your buck.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've told many people about this book. The series is wonderful. Great characters and an interesting idea for the future.
B002RVEIAI|5.0|Very good movie. Story line was good, as with all the terminator movies lots of action good effects and great sound effect.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought this book was one of the hardest to follow what with the gap in books I had lost track of who was who and which house certain people served.  A lot to digest I like many characters and the ones who stand true find the chopping block if u are this far u know almost all the Starks are dead after this. I'm not sure a Stark will see through the winter which bodes badly for all hope lies upon bran, a missing rickon, the cat of the canals and sansa...kids all mayhaps with the exception of arya who has grown the strongest in skill with bran mastering new unknown powers
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this Kate Morton book.  I haven't read any of her novels before but would read more.  Nice twist at the end.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was the best! It was funny, and had a great middle, beginning and ending. Just try stopping the book in the middle of a chapter.
B005I64U5C|3.0|Way yonder better 3D than many which are being pedaled.  The purchase arrived on time and in excellant condition.  Thanks.<br /><br />My only complaint has to do with the manner in which 3D Blu-ray is marketed.  Seemingly it is impossible to purchase just a 3D movie without having to also purchase the movie in 2D Blu-ray format.  Many times the &#34;package&#34; contains 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD, and a digital copy.  This only serves to grossly inflate the purchase price and makes one wonder if the industry is trying to sabotage 3D.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I have this book a rating of 1 star because i think we should read more dictionaries to get smarter but alot of ppl choose not to so that is why i gave this book a 1 star
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome show! Always little twists and turns that shock and surprise! Great plot and superb writers! Actors are awesome too!
0486411818|4.0|I think this book is cheap compared with its quality, I like it. ne ne de, I hope more book is as cheap as this one, especially in the U.S.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Spoilers on par with the product description.<br /><br />Aside from the whole &#34;interconnected stories across time and space&#34; theme, this book really excels because David Mitchell is some kind of literary chameleon. I am continually impressed throughout the book by how effortlessly he changes his language and writing style.<br />The language always seems character- and period-appropriate, with each character having particular writing quirks as an additional layer to their characterization in the narrative. In addition, each substory is written in a different format and/or genre and they are all surprisingly viable as stand-alone stories!<br />The interconnectedness seems more like a framing device as there is no true overarching narrative (at most a repetition of a theme). But even if it is just a gimmick, it does add something to the reading experience, especially when you get characters reacting to previous narratives.<br /><br />I have a hard time pointing out anything I didn't like. It's very well-written, the structure is interesting, the stories good, the characters fleshed-out and intriguing, even if you don't get to hear as much about them as you would if the book was dedicated to that character alone. I gladly recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Enjoy playing. This game is similar to a computer game I have, but the graphics for this app are much better.
B009VGJV0Y|5.0|The coming of age of Mia a fifteen year old working class school drop out. Mia lives in a council flat in Essex, England with her single mother and a younger sister. All the characters are coarse in their language, their manners, and especially in their sexual relations, but the director manage to capture moments of moral delicacy and complexity of feeling alongside actions that are brutal, heedless, perverse or spiteful. The surroundings are squalid and depressing, but there's a vitality, and unexpected pastoral interludes. All of it is recorded with powerful, dispassionate accuracy as well as a kind of sympathetic inwardness. The girl, played with fierce conviction by Katie Jarvis, has to contend, among much else, with the advent of an attractive male (Michael Fassbender) a deceptively paternal boyfriend of her angry, somewhat infantile mother. Her conflicted feelings about him are conveyed largely non verbally and through intimately subjective, really astonishingly effective camera work and direction that is both tough minded and sensitive. There is wonderful music, much of it presented as proceeding from a source that is visible on screen rather than as unseen accompaniment. The music, mostly old school hip hop, comes from CDs that Jarvis' character practices her dance moves to. Critics have compared Fish Tank to Truffaut's The 400 Blows. I don't think this is far fetched.
1401324649|1.0|Whew ... This book is BORING.  I bought this book because of the RAVING (ready \\"crazy, mad, disillusioned\\") reviews from the local bookstore.  I am about 1/3 way through this book and my Kindle says I have 5 more hours to go?  So, I cam eon this review site to see if maybe people say it gets better towards the end.  NOPE.  I am glad to read that others could not finish this book so I will not feel so bad stopping now.  I do not want to waste anymore time with this story.. I just do not care what happens to the characters in this book.  I have no emotional connection to them.  It is just a series of events that happen to cardboard characters.  Not interesting at all and I do not find it all that funny.  :-(
0763619612|5.0|Love this book.  Arrived in excellent condition.  Was at my doorstep faster than I had expected. I purchased this book for a specific reason and was thrilled with what I actually got.  Very happy.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Good product, music, it works, top materials, made to last,  I think a product like this will solve world peace
B00007GZQZ|5.0|We have been looking everywhere for this movie, should have looked here first and saved all the gas, great show.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|The first 4 songs were insufferable.  Boring, slow, sing-songey.  I figured he wrote them and it appears I was right.  When he sings Spanish ballades, he is at his best.  3-4 worthy songs; the rest are not good.  He needs David Foster to produce his next CD or faces losing me as a buyer of his music.  Thanks to AOL for letting me listen to the whole thing for free.  I saved money because this one would have been resold on Ebay.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|GREAT! Bought for my husband for christmas....LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!  Waiting on Season 5!  Can't wait for it to come back on!
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was a great book and was hard to stop reading. It had a great story line with many unexpected turns in the plot. Another great book by John Grisham.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This picture is the most hillarious comedy cartoon than ever seen. Will Ferrell is a great comedian. I like this product and i recomendto buy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play I LIKE IT MORE THAN THE OLD WAY WITH A DECK OF CARDS. Just getting used to the kindle.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World<br /><br />My favorite author.  Reading it now. Great weather for a book like this, that you can't put down.
B005LAII12|1.0|The movie skipped through the entire movie and blanked out - it was a mess!  Not sure why, but disappointed considering I paid almost $20 for it
B003O86FMW|3.0|It has all been said and done in The Hunger Games.  Took a long time to get interesting enough to almost finish.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I have a lot of respect for Adelle's voice & the music she makes. So young & such a lovely sound!
B004132HZS|5.0|There are already plenty of phenomenal reviews for this show. I watch a lot of tv and this does not fail to disappoint. The last episode of this season is my favorite and it really gets you pumped for the next season. The worst part about this show is that the seasons are only 3 episodes. I would suggest this to anyone!
B000002AGY|5.0|I first became familiar with this &#34;album&#34; (now a CD) when I was in college.....i had heard a cut from it on a local jazz station and i was hooked!  I immediately bought the album, and just recently bought the CD.......fabulous!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love this album. At first I was a little hesitant because the tone, while true Mumford, felt so different from the first album. After about 20 listens though I realized the genius of the lyrics and the musicality. I still think I prefer the first album if I could only choose one, but this does not fail to disappoint. I've seen too many reviews saying how this album is exactly like the first...that could not be further from the truth. As someone who has listened to each well over 100 times, that is just false. I would recommend this band AND this album to anyone who has heard a song of theirs and enjoyed it. Worth every minute of your time. Also, I would say it is worth it to purchase the deluxe edition with the 3 bonus tracks. My least favorite on the album was The Boxer, but my favorite was probably Where Are You Now. Even if it isn't a favorite of yours I think that song alone is worth the extra money! Help support a great band. BUY THIS!
0552160989|5.0|Very informative and personal account of the Vietnam war.<br />Robert Mason is smart, funny and touching.<br />I know it's cliche, but I couldn't put this book down. I'd be late to work so I could finish a chapter.
0451450523|5.0|There are already too many adequate reviews for this book on Amazon. I will just say that I picked this up because I love Pat Rothfuss and this is his favorite book. It was a very easy read with some colorful, picturesque descriptions. The story is beautiful and fun. At times it feels light-hearted and other times heart-wrenching. A worthwhile read for any age. I would buy again. I would gift this item any time.
B0088O11NU|5.0|I have to addmit to being a bit skeptic of this game at download!  But all of that was blown away the second I started to play this game!! Perhaps You need to have played games on a atari system to know how far games have come, but I suspect that this game could keep even modern children stunned for a while. The Play is flawless! The movement is Flawless! The levels get harder as you go. This game is a perfect modern replica of the classic wooden box with Knobs and a marble game I loved as a Kid. Better yet the board changes! Get this App.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|There are already plenty of phenomenal reviews for this show. I watch a lot of tv and this does not fail to disappoint. The first and last episode of this season are simply tv at its finest. The worst part about this show is that the seasons are only 3 episodes. I would suggest this to anyone!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show has it all...can't get enough of it! The casting of the characters is perfect...hope it never ends! Will be looking for Season 3 in the near future.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Reviewing as a family. Three and half year old son loves it. Sevin year old loves it. It runs on both my Polaroid tablet (I am not a fan, our son occasionally plays because he has a Vtech Innotab) and our daughters Nabi2. Is great on the Nabi because it does not allow the websites to open if the ad icons are touched. LOVE the Nabi!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you like ANY of the characters introduced in the previous books, just stop after the first one. Here's a clue: everyone that you like dies. You thought you were upset about the Starks? If you were disappointed after reading the first one, but were captivated and had to continue to the next book, then the next, and you are finally here, then I'm sorry. This fine masterpiece kills off any other character that you fell in love with, and introduces a lot of other &#34;players&#34; (aka B-Listers) into the series. It follows along with them, only giving you hints of what is going on with the main characters that aren't dead yet. This also makes you continue to fall in love with Jamie. Yes, you heard me right. If you've only read the first book and you are reading this, then go away. Others will understand. A man who was banging his own sister, a baby-killer and traitor, becomes even more noble. I hate it, but I can't stop reading. Screw you, George R. R. Martin, for sucking me into this series.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I am not an Anry Birds fan but our seven and almost four year old are. I downloaded this to my Polaroid tablet. It is not compatible with my daughters Nabi2 (which I do not understand as she has original Angry Birds). The only negative to me is the ads that our almost four year old touches all of the time. I know all free apps have ads. But with this game he always touches them because they are ads for other Angry Bird games such as space, etc. and because he is young he doesn't really understand that they are not part of the game he is playing. He primarily uses the Innotab2. If this app where on a different tablet such as our daughter's Nabi2 the ads would not matter as the Nabi will not allow the browser to open to them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All I can say is amazing!!!! I was truly hooked from the beginning. One of the best books I have read since The girl with the Dragon tattoo.
B005HSL626|4.0|I enjoy playing. Both our seven and three year old like playing. Do not have any problems with ads. Lots of fun. Runs fine on my not so great Polaroid tablet.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Can't say enough about this group. They just keep giving us great music. I love the new \\"style\\" of this one, it reminds me of my favorite elements from the OoM, REM and SLS trilogy. Not a weak song in the lot. Keep 'em coming guys!<br /><br />One note; I purchased this on iTunes. I had to install that abomination to get a decent price. Come on Amazon, the digital side started out as $18.49 then dropped to $14.99 and at the time of this review is $12.99. I paid $9.99 over \\"there.\\" Shame on you Amazon, you get 1 out of 5 stars for the obscene price gouging. That's never been my experience here before. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The game is a fun Time filler the hunting aspect could have been better though<br /><br />I like the choice of animals
B004GHNIRK|4.0|If you watched or planning to watch the Les Miserables movie then you gotta read this book. I love the use of words and the oh so many quotable lines in it. READ IT.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book ever I've never read any book better than this it is thrilling and interesting at the same time. Great pictures and words used to discriminate/tell about the picture in the article, highly recommend you buy & read this book I really think you will enjoy this book a lot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Slow start but once I got into the book I was hooked.  No good guys in this one.  I couldn't take sides.  Just when you thought you had it figured out Gillian Flynn throw you a curve.
B00931JMRE|5.0|ZZ Top is a fantastic blues/rock band. This is an excellent album. I like every song on it. Until recently I was only familiar with their several hits from Eliminator, which was popular when I was a teen, and didn't realize they have so many albums. This one is great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Simply wonderful! A great and perfect app. I love it. I wish every app was as good as this one.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|When i heard on my favorite station the release of the song I was not excited because the last 3 songs, including Madonna's &#34;Die another day&#34; was awful however as they played it I enjoyed and when I saw the movie all I can say is WOW it was better than I hoped so for fans of Adele and James Bond this is truly a riveting song and hopefully when Adele releases the best of songs she includes SKYFALL.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|okay. so this was a guilty pleasure purchase.<br />I didn't see the film in the theatre as it sounded bad<br />but the reviews for this film made it sound better than it actually is.<br />Not that it's a terrible film.<br />if you buy this for eye candy then you will be disappointing.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I did feel that the plot moved much too fast and that it could be embellished with much more detail. Otherwise the book was very entertaining.
B00A2DOKLU|4.0|Very nice album kinda reminds you of a Drake mixed with Michael Jackson, the only thing is after listening to the album for an hour it can get a little depressing because of the dark things he talks about but other than that great album
0767802519|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It came promptly=---reliable seller.  I think this movie has natalie portman, plalying as a young girl.  Superb acting.  Natalie is an amazing actress.  This movie should not be missed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was extremely amazing and kept you wanting to read more-it was even better than the hunger games. I would  highly recommend it.
B00000JGHM|5.0|There is no one like Al Pacino.  All of his movies are superb. Reliable seller. Prompt service.  I still did not finish the movie but I know it will be great.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I would not buy this if they charged and adds/taunting me to rate the app discourages me from keeping this on my Samsung Note 10.1. A saving grace is the calculator works well for landscape or portrait modes.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I do not know French, but you can almost understand it with the passion they sing with .  This is my favorite musical.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good, but not great.  Alittle too out there.  Didn t like the ending.  Would have liked to she her get her due.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|As a software dev in RL, I appreciate this game all the more. Great concept that is easy to learn and tough to master. This is my first Kairosoft game but will not be my last. Nice to see a game not requiring excessive permissions as well.
030758836X|4.0|The female main character has a very twisted mind. The other characters do not fare much better! You wish for revenge!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book has so many twists and turns I couldn't put it down!! Must read!! Can't wait for the second book!
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain --Heard too much hype, good book, but could have been shorter.  Too many times he repeats himself, but for a dog, he should get a pulizer if it was awarded to dog authors. I agree with much of author's phylosophy, reincarnation of animals as well as people, law of karma and belief.
6300215717|1.0|i would not share this with anyone at all and i am not watch this movie a again at all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E.L. James is a genius! I was attached to every word in the trilogy on a recent vacation. And &#34;I flushed&#34; when people caught me reading it! Ha!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|i enjoy there tv show very much and it been funny to me and great and wonderful and they going to love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for people who like horses fun and less expensive than the real thing<br />Children loved it as well as me
B0000VCZKM|5.0|i love this very much and i will share this with everbody i know it was funny to me and great.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Acting was wonderful, as was the casting.  It was an uplifting story that contained, all the important elements, drama, humor, a great story, irony and the sadness and unfairness of life, but also the choice we all have to lift ourselves up from our circumstances with a little help and compassioln from friends and sometimes even relative strangers.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|i love it on dvd too it look great in 3d to  me and i will tell other about it.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Very highly recommended by all that have downloaded. Webmaster of local computer club suggests the best of free programs. Has it on the ninite list.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|i love to share this with everybody i know because they going to ove it just like i did it wonderful.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|My wife and I purchased this series to watch. We like SciFi and this seemed like an interesting possibility. It is a strange combination of cowboy lore and SciFi, which is unique and fun.<br /><br />The actors immediately caught our interest and we were able to get to know them fairly quickly. We thought they worked well together in their various missions and troubles. We especially liked the fact that the captain stood firm on his convictions and was able to command the ship/crew in a strong and sensitive kind of way. He is also a bit of a mystery.<br /><br />For the SciFi and story lines, I would give this series four or five stars. However, the sexual innuendoes, and occasional crassness forces me to give it only three stars, and in some episodes deserve one star on this count. The next to the last episode -- I think one of the unaired episodes -- was especially crass and the sexual theme was distasteful to us. Unfortunately, the captain was unable to stand firm in the midst of temptation as well, which was disappointing.<br /><br />Most of the episodes are not like this and many times we ended an episode wishing for more. We were sorry to see the series end, despite my negative review in part. There are many loose ends which would be nice if they were resolved. I agree with many reviewers: it is frustrating that networks lower the boom on the continuation of a series without giving the writers and producers enough time to wrap up details. I guess that is the way it is in network television, one of the reasons we have stopped watching network TV.<br /><br />Bottom line: a fairly good series that SciFi lovers will enjoy. And if sexual content and crassness is no bother to you, then you will probably love it from beginning to end.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|i am not going to show know this one either because i  did not like one bit or at all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I could not get this to download but I have to write something so it will stop bugging me to write.
B00005LK94|4.0|it was good  to me but i won't sure it with know body else about the movie. it was okay.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids love this game.  Taking care of the horse and earning experience points is awesome.  Even when you're not playing, it still takes care of goals and earns money for you.  So when you open the game again, you're anxious to see what progress you've made while away. Very good graphics.....
B002C6A6N6|5.0|i will share this movie with other people. so they can buy it and enjoy it too they can play it too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Stunning and excellent.  I love just about everything Ken Follet writes.  He has a great talent for weaving a fictional story in accurate historic times.  His first of this trilogy was about World War I.  This one continues with many of the same characters years later before and during  WW II.  Can't wait for the third book.
0792156684|3.0|i will not share this with nobody at all.it was okay to me but that all it is. not going to see it again.
B00457WZEI|5.0|A beautifully written story with a lovely happy ending.  I was waiting for the worst and was surprised and delighted.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|i share this show with them too and they will fall in love with them just like i did too.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The ads are irritating. The game is a good way to pass time.  I would say it is comparable to the Windows 123 version.
B002VECM6S|5.0|i will tell people about the movie. because it was great to me and it will great to them to.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|The \\"watch\\" button just sent me to a dead page, then expired before it ever worked. $1.99  and I got absolutely nothing for it
B000N6TYLW|5.0|i really , really love these show very much and i will watch them again and again and watch them over.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|By far my favorite Stephen King book. It was a history lesson, love story and real life fairy tale, or was it?
B00B29J0I6|5.0|It's hard for me to find apps for my 4.5yr. old sons nabi2 that he will enjoy but so far so good with Rescue Roby. He has had it for a couple of weeks and keeps going back to it again. He loves the sound effects and is very excited when he manages to figure out how to rescue roby!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Very informative, and for the most part it answered my questions. It did however, lack answers to several questions regarding placement of pictures.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is great! As the whole series, it is good for teaching mythology and English style and grammar. It's a great read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just finished and seen the previews for the movie hope they stick close to the book slow start but great finish.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It turns out that they did update it for the kindle. It is version 0.6.1 and on most other devices it is version 0.6.0. I don't think there is a difference between 0.6.1 and 0.6.0, but I've tried them both and they are pretty cool. I only wish they'd add pistons, levers,buttons, and more technology like light bulbs and wires maybe.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Anyone who has family in, or knows someone in the military should read this. Beyond war, it shows how much a faith in something, for Chris it was God,  can bring you through the more than just everyday life.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I think this game is really fun,but it does take a while for it to download.what I think I want to rate this with is a three star,just because of how long it takes to download it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E.L. James you are truly amazing. I have fallen in love with this trilogy. I couldn't put this book down. I was reading it at work, stop lights, any free second I had was spent reading this book. I re-read this trilogy for a second time because I couldn't get enough. Ana and Christian are such a beautiful couple in their own way. 50 shades is unlike anything I have ever read. After you've read the whole trilogy you can look back and see how beautiful their relationship really was. This book was fun and exciting, from Crazy ex girlfriends to car chases, to attempted murder, and a kinky little red play room. This book really has a little of everything. A must read for any one.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you have ever read the other book s in this series then you will love this one as well
B00846REIS|1.0|I loved 50 shades. E.L. James is truly amazing. So I was really hoping to fall in love with bared to you, but I felt like I was reading a bad version of 50 shades. Maybe if I never read 50 shades I'd like this more, but I feel like names and settings were changed, but over all same book. I guess I can't say too much because I never finished this book. I got half way and was bored. I rather read 50 shades for a third time.... I was highly disappointed.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved this book. My first Kate Morton but it will not be my last. I couldn't wait to finish - and what an ending!! I recommended this to my daughter for her book club.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At first, when my bro got it, I thought it would be a waste of time, and money,but,boy,I was wrong!!!!!!
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|I love Belkin cases.  I have used them for my Kindles for a number of years now and have been very happy with the brand. I like the color choices and they are made from neoprene, with a soft inner lining as well, which will really protect your Kindle without adding a lot of weight/volume.<br /><br />The case zips open enough to get your Fire in and out of in, and it has a durable zipper. You can pick your pattern or color and it really does protect your Kindle. Recommended!
B00683JK9K|3.0|I really enjoy puzzles & not having to worry about my Kiddos stealing or messing up the pieces. I know there is only so many puzzles, but hey, it's free. I like that you can pick how many pieces you want the puzzle to be. I frontline that you can't save your progress...maybe it is just because I'm using it on my Kindle Fire HD. This app is worth downloading if you need something to do while your waiting for a meeting or etc.
B001JNNDGA|3.0|This is a good movie but the subject is very painful to me... Very well done.. I was concerned that I could get thru it again.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think this app is good. I like that I can upload and tag photos right from my Kindle Fire HD. I however, don't like that I am unable to share post or links of my friends.
B004OZZ624|2.0|Generally I can suspend disbelief if the other qualities of a film are at least good.  Certainly the cast in this one is excellent from top to bottom. The pace of the film lags in places but overall is acceptable.  But repeatedly I found myself thinking \\"ridiculous\\" or \\"oh come off it\\" or \\"get real!\\"  As with so many movies I've seen over the years this was a good cast wasted.  Haggis is apparently a good director but he needs help with script writing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun and addicting. There are a few changes from regular temple run to temple run 2. First off, there is a rope you slide down on in the beginning, and sometimes other places. And once you get far enough,you will be in a scene similar to Indiana Jones in a wagon on train tracks. Also the surrounding is different, it doesn't take place in a forest environment, but a roady, mountainy area. Overall great game and is very addictive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so amazing! Its pretty hard to top the original, but 2 knocks it out of the water! Its so awesome!! Everyone who doesn't have the game should get if now!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the game was very fun and it has really good graphics and I love the daily challenges and all the characters
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like this game. The hidden object parts are fun and I always liked point and click adventure games. This game is very well done but I only have the trial. I don't know if I'll be purchasing the full game because it is 5 dollars but maybe I will because I really want to finish it!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Totally addicting, my after school program kids are starting to help me solve the puzzles.  It.really makes you think.  Great pictures too
B007HACDLK|4.0|Liked this book from Vince Flynn as I could not put it down until I finished it. I hope we get a few more before the series are done.
B0019M068O|5.0|This completes the rest of their important hits along with the initial ABBA GOLD album. I was raising children during the '70's, and didn't have time to listen as closely as I would have wanted.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This is a wonderful album. Crisp, new and playable all year round. I wish they had released it on a CD!
0385736002|2.0|the book in which i recived was bend half way down the middle halfway through the book, as i recall on the review that was posted it said &#34;good condition&#34; i would just like to point that out.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This book is great for those who can't get enough of the show. Small details change but the story is almost exact. It's short but I'm excited to read the next one.
0316069434|5.0|A Scandinavian journalist is murdered some 20 years ago during the Rodney King riots. Bosch has only a bit of time to investigate before he is pulled away to another assignment. In a touching moment he tells her he is sorry and he never forgets the case. He re-investigates it in the present and the clues, slowly at first, but then overwhelmingly point him in an unexpected direction. Intrigue is ever-present. Bosch continues to develop his relationship with his daughter though his love interest doesn't get much attention in this book (not too big a loss in my opinion). Connelly only gets better and better. Here is to hoping Bosch will be back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Only one thing to say about this game.......I LOVE IT! I have been looking for a long time for a game like this and I finally found it!
B000095IUM|5.0|Which Beethoven symphonic cycle is best depends on what you're looking for, and even then I don't believe one can limit \\"the best\\" to just one choice. If it's period performance I want, I look to Immerseel or Bruggen (the first set; I haven't heard the second one yet). If it's old style big band renditions, I go with Karajan or Szell or perhaps Bernstein, depending on what mood I'm in. And then there's this set by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, which I find increasingly attractive. Played on modern instruments but with period performance sensibilities, these performances allow the smaller -- relatively speaking -- ensemble to give us transparency and a wealth of texture. Harnoncourt may have his eccentricities now and then, but there's no denying he usually dishes up vigorous, muscular performances -- noticeable in his Mozart and Haydn, perhaps less distinct when it comes to a composer like Beethoven, who is muscular to begin with. If you're looking for Beethoven that has heft and power but which feels released from the heaviness of a large modern orchestra, try out this set. Personally, I love it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a nail biter and wish i had a man like him to care for me and want me.
B005LAIGSM|1.0|I was so inspired by the book but the movie was so far removed from the book! Not only does it dilute the real story, but it's inaccurate on so many levels. If you want to be truly awed read the book.
0307476464|3.0|1Q84 is Haruki Murakami's latest contribution to modern literature, and at some 950 pages I suppose \\"epic\\" would not be an inaccurate appellation.  Actually, in Japan it was originally a series of three books, but here in the US in hardcover it was one fat book that caused wrist pain by the weight of both the volume and the narrative.  A friend who recommended it remarked that it was a \\"commitment,\\" which is an understatement, at best.  Having read Kafka on the Shore, which I found brilliant, and his even more famous novel Norwegian Wood, which impressed me less, I had great hopes for 1Q84, although I suppose I knew that it could go either way.<br /> 1Q84 launches at high-speed, if not a fever pitch, as Aomame (which weirdly means \\"green peas\\" in Japanese), a beautiful assassin with a taste for classical music - especially Janacek's 1926 \\"Sinfonietta\\" - steps out of a cab stuck in traffic on a gridlocked highway and walks down an off-limits access stairway to a completely different world, which she later discovers has two moons!  Murakami's taste for his brand of magical realism - in Kafka it randomly rained mackerel one day - is back in full force, as he invents a world with vaguely malevolent \\"little people\\" who climb out of a dead goat's mouth and spin an air chrysalis that creates a kind of complementary but uniquely different \\"other body\\" for the human who happens to be nearby.  All of this is thrilling and fascinating at first, as the reader pores through hundreds of pages of reasonably compelling writing to learn about this new world and its inhabitants.  Unfortunately, Murakami - unlike Tolkien, for example - never fully fleshes out his alternate universe or explains what any of it means.  In fact, it is simply a sideshow to the love story at a distance between Aomame and a boy named Tengo she met and fell in love with at ten years old. It turns out that although they have not seen each other for two decades, Tengo and Aomame are - unknown to one another -- both separately obsessed with the other, although neither is sure why, and for her part Aomame declares her intention to die for him!<br /> Tengo, even more so than the male protagonist of Norwegian Wood, is an incredibly uninteresting, dull, even insipid character, whose story is told in alternating chapters.  It is hard to believe that he could have passion for anyone, and especially that anyone could have passion for him. Tengo, a budding but thus far largely unsuccessful writer, was chosen to ghost-rewrite a novel by a prodigy who happens to be a stunning sixteen year old girl who knows all about the \\"little people.\\"<br /> Some of the writing is outstanding such as \\"You throw a stone into a deep pond. Splash. The sound is big, and it reverberates throughout the surrounding area. What comes out of the pond after that? All we can do is stare at the pond, holding our breath.\\" And: \\"That's what the world is, after all: an endless battle of contrasting memories.\\"  Murakami has a gift for bringing an existential clarity to the fatalism often carved in human emotion.<br />There's a wonderful paragraph where, through Tengo the struggling novelist, Murakami seems to answer his critics of Kafka (and perhaps anticipating those for 1Q84).  The fictional critic in the newspaper Tengo is reading acknowledges that the book he has ghost-rewritten for the teenage girl is  \\". . .  put together in an exceptionally interesting way . . . [that] carries the reader along to the very end . . .\\" but then condemns all the aspects of the narrative not appropriately explained and concludes that \\" . . . many readers are likely to take this lack of clarification as a sign of `authorial laziness.'\\" In response, Tengo asks rhetorically: \\"If an author succeeded in writing a story \\"put together in an exceptionally interesting way\\" that \\"carries the reader along to the very end,\\" who could possibly call such a writer `lazy?'\\" When I read that, I hearkened back to Kafka, and agreed with Tengo.  But the more I read 1Q84, the more I took an opposite view with this one. In fact, the writing did not carry me to the very end, although I did stick with it and slog through the last half of the 950 pages largely because I wanted to learn what really happaned, and what it was all about.  I never did find out; frankly, it was not worth the commitment.<br /> All of this is sad because Murakami is a compelling writer with a terrific imagination.  I have always enjoyed magic realism when it is employed cleverly as a novelistic technique, such as in Flanagan's Gould's Book of Fish, in several of Gabriel Garcia Marquez works such as One Hundred Years of Solitude and Autumn of the Patriarch, and in Murakami's own Kafka on the Shore. In 1Q84, it's use and the basis of the narrative is exciting at first - the novel is a mixture of mystery, suspense, sci-fi, action adventure, contemporary fiction - but soon the author seems to lose sight of everything except the tedious unlikely romance of Aomame and Tengo, both of whom - especially Tengo - I began to hate by the book's conclusion.  Many of the other characters Murakami creates for the story are little more than walk-on cardboard cut-outs, or fully fleshed figures that he later abandons and never resurrects, although he does conjure up two sensational outlaws in Tamaru and Ushikawa that he then fails to utilize to suit their respective potentials.  I haven't given up on reading the rest of Murakami's novels, but 1Q84 has clearly left me wanting to take a break awhile.t the more I read 1Q84, the more I took an opposite view with this one.

4898153194|4.0|This is a very sweet photo story book. It was much smaller than I expected and a little pricey, but I'm glad I purchased the book. It is obviously a labor of love!
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Okay, apparently some people really dug this movie. Go figure. After an okay set-up, second act gets real slow, and by the time things should start heating up...boring, boring, boring. Actually kept the sound going with my back to the screen during the second half of the movie while I reprogrammed by DVR.<br />You have been warned!<br />BORING!
B00004W4UB|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD as it was an usual treatment  of the subject, which differed from the other DVD I saw. JMH
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have a great time playing this game. It has a great learning curve, and relaxing to play. The ability to choose characters is good and the large monster is better than the mommy's.
B005HSL626|1.0|I hated it. The movements are too darn fast to keep up with on the kindle..no thank you ..keep it
B007EECSFA|5.0|I read this book because I have read Kate Morton's other 3 novels and enjoyed them all.  This one was no disappointment!  I especially liked the ending which I suppose I should have guessed but did not...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is just awesome! There is one glitch with the best movement though where you have to delete it and get it back because it then doesn't work.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it wont let me play temple run 2 I don't know why but it just wont.I still love the game but it wont let me play it.

B00164GDD2|5.0|What else can you say about Ghostbusters that hasn't already been said by its fans over the years? It's a nice addition to the Blu-Ray collection. Still a entertaining movie. The HD conversion isn't half bad. It's still a bit dated, but it still holds up pretty well.
B008ASGP3U|3.0|There's no finish.  It's as though Ian Rankin ran out of time and just sent it off.  Too bad, he had a good story going.

B0013F1D02|1.0|We heard of this movie through Family Fun magazine. It had a 4.5 star rating and we said, \\"Go for it!\\" This is easily one of the worst movies we have ever seen. We have no idea how the ratings are high. It was a mixture of a bunch of random things such as weird witches who kept sacrificing alligators and other creatures, and a star (lady) who had no idea of what was going on. The ending was predictable. We watched an hour of the movie and then skipped to the end (it was that bad). We correctly predicted who was the king, who would die, and who would get married. If you know what you're doing, you will skip this terrible movie and spare yourself from the worst experience of your life.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Much better than Fifty Shades, would recommend this book to all women and even some men would enjoying it - very well written and easy to read
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I was never into the Batman movies until Nolan took the franchise under his arm. I bought the first one in the saga (Batman Begins) for my husband who loved the movie and I got into it as much as he did. As soon as the second movie came out, he went to see it with his friends. Then I bought the movie from Amazon. Excellent quality, both concerning the product itself and the movie, as well. We're currently waiting for the third movie, which we both went to see at the theater together. We have already put it on our wish list here in Amazon. Just waiting for the price to go down a bit. If you liked the first Nolan Batman movie, you're going to love this one, too... and the third one (hopefully, he'll keep it going beyond a third one.)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game helps you learn how to take care of a horse and makes it feel like you have your own horse.
B000002GWN|5.0|Joni Mitchell has an amazing voice and her songs are like poetry. They talk of love and relationships a lot and a number have a beautiful haunting quality about them. The LA Express provide the backing with terrific playing that enriches the songs and Joni Mitchell's voice. This is a CD of the original vinyl disc made in the seventies and is true to the original.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Never had to read it in high school. Glad I did now, even better that it was free.  Very good book for all ages.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|This is a fun listen.  Fun's music is unique and light hearted.  I think my wife likes this album even more than I do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i absoultly love it its sound be really a 10 star rateing  one of the best free game on kindel fire HD 7  :D their should be lots more free games like temple run cuz its awesome and very additive :D ...
B0000844M8|5.0|A classic movie that is still as good as when it was filmed.  I enjoyed watching this film with my family and I think you will too.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is fun to past the time but not myi favorite. Thank you for making it available. I don't like to dirty my screen,
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A little more religion than i expected but it is a part of his story. He overcame many obstacles in his life and never quit. Wow.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This one was the one that got me started on games. My grandson had it so I ask my daughter who helps me out all the time to put it on for me. I really enjoy this one too. Thank you so very much
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Author did a great job of telling the unexpected side of the story. After years of unanswered questions, old enemies become friends.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love Walking Dead, and I can't wait to see it again in season 3. I want to see what happens to the characters!
B00899F0G8|5.0|This show has me hooked. Love PLL. Show never gets old. Wow  EZRA!! HOT!! Good for teens and adults as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like Tue New update on it. It is so boss. I think it is the best game ever. TOBUSCUS even plays this. And by the way I am TOBUSCUS and I don't usually play on this kindle because I mostly just play on the computer. BLESS YOURE FACE,if you sneezed during the reading bless you, PEACE OFF.
B000002H7I|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before about Tracy Chapman. Her music and voice are stupendous. I love the album .
B000002KIE|5.0|Ended up reading a s***ty one star review for this album. dis is raw, feral, primal punk aggression! play dis bad boy when you're on da treadmill! then come talk 2 me, naysayers! also, really good ones are Johnny Lydon's band PIL or Public Image Limited. So the bad reviews dissing this album are by some of the less esoteric beings out there in Amazon-world. IMO, these guys were better and more energized than their more popular and more critically lauded counterparts, The Clash. I can think back to a time when Nevermind The Bollocks never left da cassette deck! Steve Jones and Paul Cook are grossly underrated musicians.
B003B96AOW|3.0|great figure but can only give it 3 stars because straight out the package he leg joints are so loose he cant even stand with his base or on his own which is a huge letdown no good way to display the figure without leaning him back on his base
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I broke one end of my old cable when I stepped on it.  I thought I would have to pay at least $15 plus shipping to replace.  This one fits and works perfectly for a very good price and the seller shipped it priority so I got it as soon as possible and received a tracking number.  Good product, good seller, good transaction.
0307716988|5.0|This book was really good and very touching. Everyone who helped write it is incredible! I received my order fast and it was in great condition!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you liked the original, you'd really like Temple Run 2.  The graphics are great and I liked that there is more point to getting new characters, etc.  Game play is fun and very addicting.
6305428042|5.0|This movie is a classic and so funny! Your family and friends will like watching it even if it isn't Halloween!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Great app for streaming music.  I really like the search function where you can search by artist or song or you can find stations by genre.  I love that it even has movie soundtracks and anime stations. Favorite-ing stations is very simple, loading is quick, and the history tracker is very useful.
B0000029LG|5.0|The music is so good! As expected of Michael! It is a great and really catchy album to listen to!
B007THA4FI|3.0|expected book to be better, took too much time before getting into it.. thought JKR would write a better book for<br />adults.. however didn't ever read Potter books or see movies
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I just loved that little movie- it was funny, really well done, laughed a lot, cried even a bit... I can absolutely recommend this one!
B00999DFP0|5.0|So great to watch! Love having it in the house and so happy we bought all the seasons since they go by fast
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|excellent movie, this movie arrived on time loved it  if you have not seen it don,t miss the action please.
B004LWZW42|5.0|THIS  MOVIE  WAS  BETTER  THAN  I  EXPECTED  EVEN  THOUGH  I  WAS  TOLD  IT  WAS  A  GOOD  MOVIE  I  STILL  HAD  REASONS  FOR  NOT  BELIEVING  WHAT  I  HAD  HEARD,  DID'NT  KNOW  HOW  THE  BEAST  BECANE  BLUE  BUT  THIS  MOVIE  CLEAR  UP  HOW  THAT  HAPPEN,  AND  IT  ALSO  SHOWED  HOW  MAGNETO  BECAME  SO  EVIL  AND  DECIDED  TO  GO  OFF  ON  HIS  ON  AND  BECOME  SOME  BODY  THAT  WOULD  BECOME  A  MUTANT THAT  HIS  BROTHER  WOULD  OPPOSE,  ALSO  I  NEVER  KNEW  HOW  PROFESSOR  X  BECAME  PARALYZE  BUT  THE  WAY  THIS  MOVIE  PUT  INTO  EFFECT  HOW  MAGNETO  COULD  REFLECT  BULLETS  MADE  THE  WHOLE  THING  POSSIBLE  ALSO  MADE  SENSE,  I  ALSO  WONDERED  HOW  MAGNETO  GOT  THE  HELMET,  THAT  HE  TOOK  FROM  ANOTHER  MUTANT  SO  THIS  MOVIE  PUT  TOGETHER  SOME  PUZZLED  PECIES  THAT  I  ALWAYS  WONDERED  ABOUT.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is different than anything I have read before. I enjoyed it. Worth taking the time to read. Ready for book 2.
0375869026|4.0|We got this book as a gift for a particular grandchild who seems to lack empathy for others.  I believe this opened her eyes to the pain of others.  Her brother read it, too, and found it thoughtful.  Different, but great book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had read as a kid, many years ago, the abridged version of the book, and loved it. For those with limited time or patience, I would still recommend to stick to a good abridged version. It would be the equivalent of going and seeing the excellent musical that was just published, and you will not miss any of the action.<br /><br />Reading this full version is only for the seriously committed reader - it is well over 800 pages, and there are a great number of them dedicated to either philosophical discussion or long recounts of historical events.<br /><br />For those with the patience to read through every page, however, the reward will be great. This book is a vibrant, immersive portrait of the times of Napoleon and just after, much better than any textbook other prose. It is an amazing compendium of the schools of thought at the time, and looks at the fundamental problems of good and evil, pain and suffering, duty, sacrifice, progress, tradition, and above all, love, from a great many different angles. Victor Hugo is never an impassioned observer of these agonizing topics, he always serves his own solution to the problem right after its definition. I found that I often disagreed - sometimes vehemently - with his views, however his writing is so crystal clear, that it made it easy to also define my disagreement in precise, rational terms. After having a mental argument with him, I feel vastly enriched, and much more clear in my own views, and hope that other readers could be similarly enriched.<br /><br />Plus, all these extra pages paint a great backdrop, against which the figures of Jean Valjean, Fantine, Cosette, Gavroche, The Bishop, Thenardier, become so much more detailed, vibrant and alive - in a sense I felt I was meeting each and every one of them for the first time. It is the difference between meeting a stranger for an hour versus having a friend you have known for years.<br /><br />This particular version is a very easy read, written in contemporary english, and well formatted. Being offered for free also doesn't hurt. Go ahead and download it, and give it a try. If you survive through the first 50-or so pages encounter with the Bishop without losing interest, chances are you will love every extra page of it.
1416550550|5.0|This book contains a mystery spun out over three generations of women.  The author ties it together beautiful as the book unfolds across two continents.  The book holds your interest consistently.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Typical Sparks book-girl meets boy &falls in love. Easy read-enjoyed it on plane ride during vacation. Always enjoy reading a book before seeing the movie. Sparks never disappoints!
014312093X|4.0|This book is a good old spy book; John le Carre does it again with his George Smiley series.  This will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I would recommend this game. Very entertaining. Since it is entertaining I found that once I started playing this, I didn't want to stop.
0385341075|2.0|This book is well-written but I was overwhelmed with the violence and pain it contains.  A very sad story, and not something I want to spend my time reading.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical Grisham book. KInd of slow in the middle but excellent ending.<br /><br />Narration really added to my enjoyment.Good job. End
1250004349|4.0|This book is very well-written and moving.  It relates to a very sad event, however, so the reader must be prepared for that.  I found it hard to forget and very sad.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love Norah Jones and her songs. It would be useful to have the possibility to by DVDs too with her new songs and concerts
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We got this for our granddaughter for Xmas but it would be a great gift for anyone 10-90 years old!  Our granddaughter (13) is so hard to buy for; there's not much she likes.  She is still playing with it and enjoys it, as does everyone, even Mom & Dad.  Don't miss this one -- it's a great buy.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I love Norah Jones and her songs. It would be useful to have the possibility to by DVDs too with her new songs, concerts.
B0044DEAUA|3.0|It's just o.k.  - the sounds isn't really as clear as was expected on an iphone - a bit disappointed
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I love Norah Jones and her songs. It would be useful to have the possibility to by DVDs too with her new songs. We wait for your concert in Romania!!!!!!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Once you start reading these books you won't be able to put them down.<br />I would reccommend these books to everyone
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I love Norah Jones and her songs. It would be useful to have the possibility to by DVDs too with her new songs.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This is good mobile software, however, I find myself not using it much simply due to the constraint of using this on a small phone screen.  Edited documents on the phone do consistently translate well to a desktop version.
0451209338|4.0|GOOD PLOT, GOOD WRITING, GOOD EVERITHING, EXCEPT THAT THE ENDING IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS THE REST OF THE STORY.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|A fabulous documentary that is a must own for any Rush fan.  The video and interviews with their family are awesome, and reveal a lot new insight into the band.
B00381A1MU|3.0|I thought that I was getting a great bargain until I saw it.  It was not as large as I was hoping that it would be.  But my son likes it anyway.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This CD just demonstrated his maturity & growth.<br />Great songwriter and storyteller<br /><br />Would definitely look out for his next release!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There are so many genres contained in this show! Action, Romance, Comedy, History, Drama, Crime and Mystery, Philosophical, Political, even a brief dash of Fantasy.<br /><br />This is a series you want to watch back-to-back and call in sick for. The characters are wonderfully layered and complex, funny and complicated, serious and surprising. The story is so well written, you never EVER get bored.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a MUST reader for anyone who attempted a diet to lose weight then went off it and gained more than they started with. The book is technical in parts showing that the author has a great deal of both knowledge of the subject and compassion for his patients. This should be the last book anyone needs to lose and maintain their ideal weight. The books name is catchy but the subject is quite serious
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was all wrapped up in this story. The challenges that they gone through were crazy and some I didn't even expect...loved this book can't wait for walking disaster to come out.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This is both very functional and very cool. It has basic arithmetic functions as well as powers, roots, both types of logs, parens, etc. It is remarkably capable at reading handwriting. And the latest update seems to have improved its already delightful quality. You won't regret downloading this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is zoo awesome!I'm saving up for Carmen she's looks cool also the game is great.but I keep getting caught by the cop. I already upgraded to the Rio game
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works like a charm. It imported my OneNote files instantly and without hassle. It synchs beautifully with all my devices. I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really fun and everyone should try this I love to try to beat my friends on Facebook it's really a competition but super fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a GREAT app!! I can choose from tons of different devotional plans and set reminders so I don't forget to read that day. The plans range from a few days long to an entire year. There is truly something for everyone. I have been choosing plans that focus on women, my husband chooses plans that fit his spiritual needs, and my teenage son chooses plans geared for teens. You can also choose which version of the Bible you would like to read, and you can read your scripture in multiple versions to get a better understanding. I have found that to be very helpful. This app is easy to use and perfect for keeping me on track with a daily devotional. Love it!!
B007REV4YI|1.0|Given all the spectacular reviews I had every intention of seeing this at the theater but somehow never got around to it. Lo and behold, Amazon had it as an \\"exclusive\\" early purchase instant video so I ordered immediately. What did I see? Unrealistic over-the-top action and fight sequences, a meandering incoherent and utterly implausible \\"story\\" and a fixation on M. Who cares about M? And it is time, really, for Judi Dench to disembark from this sinking ship.<br /><br />Their gimmick is to call any action movie \\"Bond.\\" That way they're sure to get audiences in droves simply by virtue of that name. Well, these are no longer Bond movies, and it's fraudulent on the part of the filmmakers to call them Bond movies. I'm not saying I want to go back to campy bond, I'm saying that the franchise should be put to rest. It engendered some great movies and anyone that wants to see Bond can watch them.<br /><br />Back to Skyfall. When they went to Bond's childhood orphanage to wait for the so-called killers, that did it for me. I couldn't go on. It occurred to me just how terrible this movie was. Not because of Craig either. I loved Casino Royale. I even loved Quantum of Solace. Those are infinitely better films than this monstrosity.
B0058YPL66|5.0|i will collect as long as they run the series.  I also gave two sets as  gifts and they were a hit
B00129I5SM|5.0|I own ALL of the Resident Evil movies (DVDs) and this one is one of my favorite! We just recently moved and some how my previous DVD of this movie got broken, so I purchased a new one from Amazon to replace it. Once it arrived, hubby and I sat down and had ourselves a Resident Evil marathon :)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Greatest purchase ever I carry it with me where ever i go and use it for everything from kitchen knives to wire cutters
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|even though we have many of the controls in place we are missing the agility and visibility of wip and the big picture understanding of how IT should serve the core business. this book is a must have for any senior or manager that is involved with either IT operations or development or both.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Reality shows... Bread and Circus... they seem so familiar to us, don't they? Cheaters, Big Brother... you name it. It must be already there.<br /><br />Collins only goes a little bit further.<br /><br />I hated the new society that she created, but I found a lot of presend-day within the covers of the book.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|Moon Reader Pro has loads of options, very stable in all formats, just a pleasure to use. I feel it is a bargain at the price and is the only reader I need. Thanks for a quality product.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Love, love this book.  It kept me glued the minute I began reading it.  It has a shocking twist and this author wrote in a way that I felt like a detective myself.  I really enjoy books by this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so much. I play it every day.<br />its so much fun. I have it on my iphone and kindle!
0470876417|5.0|Excellent book for students and entrepreneurs. Lots of visuals and a business model canvas you can apply to your life!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Outstanding Read. Should be required reading of every american. Puts perspective on many events the reader actually lived through based on all the years covered. Well documented. A must read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game can go quickly the second time around. was easier so I could appreciate the show a bit more.  It's well laid out and I liked the story
0062200909|5.0|I loved this book. it was awesome seeing the designs for the characters, and places in the Hobbit. I am buying the next one of these that is coming out in May.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was fun but the deals are stupid. The new York one was better than the Rio one. Hope you  agree.
0307352153|5.0|It is hard to be an introvert in the modern U.S culture. I'm an artistic introvert and have felt overshadowed by extroverts my entire life. I related with every page of this book, and appreciated that the author even shared her personal experiences. Introverts do not receive all the recognition they deserve, but we have important contributions to offer the world. This book has made me proud to be an introvert and I now feel more confident about navigating through life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen really draws the readers in by how personal she gets with the characters. She keeps you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what is going to happen...I couldn't put the book down I believe I read it in two days. Great work Colleen can't wait to see what you'll come out with next.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|every time I open it it just goes back to the home screen. if anyone can help please tell me!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is awesome. Taking care of the horse is very rewarding. Only issue I ever had was waiting for more energy, it wouldn't load any more when I was off the app. fixed itself though so I'm pleased!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This App is the best app I have played this app on my ipod touch before but it wasn't the same.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not as dark as I was expecting... lighter but still sexy<br />I can't wait to start #3... what is next?
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Our whole family love this movie.  We've all read the books and it's probably going to be the best movie adaptation as there will be.
B004G600A4|1.0|I really enjoy this movie but when I bought it the disc wouldn't work in any of my dvd or blu-ray players.  I tried it in four different players and none of them would play the disc, all of them said that it was unable to be read.  I am sending it back right away and will buy it from another source.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The movie was just so-so for me. Not sure whether or not the sound was purposely done to extremes but it was annoying having to always have my finger on the volume button. Some dialog had to be turned way up to hear then BAM the gunshot or other action would be extremely loud and I would have to run the volume way down.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I was there but It would have been nice if they had the whole show not bits and pieces of it.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I really like this game, it is a nice way to relax after a long stressful day. It really challenges your ability to pick out the small things.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is relatively challenging. Graphics are well done. The only downside is it's too short. Wish there was another game that takes up where this one leaves off.
B005LAIH5O|5.0|great movie enjoyed watching with my wife, wanted to watch for a long time perfect movie thank you thank you
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. No viruses or pop ups. The only thing I hate and it is that here recently, it kicks up out of games. Stating that there is a connection error. All-in-all, its a fun and addictive game. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Gift for grandson and he loves it. He plays this on Xbox so he can this now later when wants to lay down in bed.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|When I bought this game I wasn't real sure if I would like it or if it would be just another match 3 game. I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised. The graphics are great, the game interface is easy &amp; you can choose how easy it challenging you want it to be. Altogether, it's a fun way to pass the time!!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I am able to connect to a device over serial through the hyper-terminal program.  I can both upload and download data.  Simply works.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's exciting to feed and ride and pet your very own virtual horse! You can even compete in different jumps and turns &amp; stuff! I even like playing as adult- it's relaxing:)
B0047VSW30|3.0|Was okay for historical value assuming it was portrayed accurately, I cannot verify whether it was or not.  Actors did a fine job but I found it to be less engrossing than I expected.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  But I watched to the end with only one interruption of a few hours.  I am not interested in ever watching again.  I am one of those that can enjoy a movie I like more than two or three times.  So for me, this means this movie deserves a negative recommendation. Just an opinion.  I am too busy to provide a repetitious review.
B007SGM084|3.0|I heard so much about these books I decided to check them out for myself. Initially found them really slow moving & hard to get interest in the beginning & then once it started going they just werent the kind of books for me. I did buy the bundle & since I paid for all 3 (Not Cheap) I finished all 3. I suppose these books have a lot of fans that are interested in this particular lifestyle but it all seemed a little far fetched & graphic....I wouldnt go so far as to say they were terrible. Just not my kind of reading material. I like more Nora Roberts, Nicholas Sparks, Debbie Macomber. I have read the Hunger Games Trilogy which isnt typically my type & i really enjoyed them. I also surprisingly somewhat enjoyed the Twilight Series.  50 shades tho... not so much.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|For some unknown reason I am unable to play these two DVD's.  Apparently the Region Rating is incorrect.  I have previously  purchased DVD's from Amazon and have not had this problem before.  Hence I will need to return both and hopefully you can send replacements which work in Australia.  Am bitterly dissappointed.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I'm sure this would work in areas where I need to connect with WiFi  - - but Ive not found it very helpful on my Kindle Fire HD yet
B009UX2YAC|5.0|easy and fun to play. i highly recommend it: i know that my nephews will enjoy it!! Some missions are long but you can always buy in the store to skip it:)
B00005214X|5.0|Love this album.It is so George as his fans will understand.Beautifully written &#34;All things must pass &#34; which means more than ever now this lovely man has passed himself.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've used just about every office app out there. The default google viewer, google docs, Kingsoft, QuickOffice, etc. This one beats the others hands down. It will still have some render issues from time to time, but of any of the apps I've used, this one renders properly the most often. Editing is easy too, but still a pain on both tablet and phone. It's more a limitation of the device and touchscreen than the app. Overall, very happy with this app. Highly recommended.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app because it completely occupies my time especially with me being a tern I am always looking for the hottest games.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love the app....we use it for the kids at bedtime and then use it for ourselves I've noticed that I have a more restful sleep cycle and more energized day
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this and really like the features.  Really improved over the other product I tried.  Would download again if needed.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|My kids love this series. My 8th grade daughter is reading this second book in the Wimpy Kid series right now. Although it is an easy read for her age group, she does not enjoy long novels and this is right up her alley. My other daughter read this series in 4th grade and enjoyed them all.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Simply didn't want it to end. If there is a part two to this I need to know about it!
B00063EMJ6|4.0|Purchased for a friend. Didn't have the song they were looking for but they were pleased with it none the less.
0321885112|5.0|For those who would like to develop and organize their ideas in their own sketching and noting style. This book inspires me to draw and gives me many good tricks to turn what you think it's difficult into the easier way. Everyone can draw!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed &#34;The Help&#34; will like this too. Readers will be rooting for the family through the entire book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Quickly find chapter/verse, set up reading plans, share verses, keep notes,  view several translations, and it goes everywhere with you!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this because I love John Green. I will definitely be reading this again and again. New to my top favorite s!
B0086700CM|5.0|Yggdrasil g g h u h h h h unbar bu h bbbhbhb h Bobby h h j h h
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game it is so fun it's addictive I have really been enjoying the world tour thanks creator's bye
B005GFPZYK|4.0|So, I was finishing Mr. Kyle's book the other day and nearing the writing of my review when I saw the terrible news on TV that Mr. Kyle had been murdered. All I want to say is that I'm terribly sorry for Taya, Chris' children and the rest of his family and my heart goes out to them. Chris Kyle was a patriot.<br />Because this is still a book review, I'll add one more thing. I enjoyed the book greatly. Any gripes I may have with it are minor and would just be nit-picking. I think everyone should give American Sniper a try. I know this isn't a very helpful review, but it is what it is. I gave 4 stars because I couldn't put it down until I was finished and to me, that is all that matters this time.
B0091REZMW|3.0|ok game but like most it is just an opp to ask player to give money to play higher level
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great interactive pet alternative.  Very informative.  Great graphics and quality  graphics.  Lots of challenges and incentives that help you personalize your horse.  Training and cleaning, also feeding and games.
