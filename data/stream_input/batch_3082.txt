B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you want to read an acurate review look for Julie from Boston. I guess the bottom line is money with total disregard for quality why else would an author pen such a bad book.
B008LXZFH6|4.0|It was good. Raved about by everyone I know but I've liked other movies better. Laughed out loud a couple times. Could definitely watch it again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|absolutely a fantastic game--kept me interested at all times.  didn't want to stop playing it. have told many friends to get this game.  please let me know the name of other games that are like this one.  i would be willing to purchase them.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|I enjoy the game but I have had to send it to the cloud and reinstall it. Frustrating. The game is fun but it locks at different levels. Perhaps they need to work out the bugs. I know they had to change the first game because of its problems, perhaps this one should be done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wonderfully addictive.  Kids love it and so do I. Enjoy all the different characters, just wish more would be available for purchase with bananas
B0035HKWM6|4.0|Always fun to watch again! Love the music and dance scenes especially. The dog adds a fun element. Not to mention Cameron Diaz.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's a fun game but certain things are not necessary for the game, like having multiple rooms, just have one and make it big
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved the experiments. Though I was aware of the potential this book cemented my belief in the power of the mind over potential.
B00F9A903O|5.0|All that's wrong is when you send a request they really say no most of the time and you have to wait 24 hours to send another request. But otherwise it is an great game. I don't mind it like I said. You should get it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy I can play Candy Crush on my Kindle. I love this game very addictive but fun. Glad I can play more often.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Blended with believable fictional characters. Truly tells the horrors of war, especially on the German people who were not Nazis.
140006922X|4.0|Terrific scholarship. Fascinating look into the times. Helps read the Bible with wonderful new insight into the context and time line in which texts were written.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is a credible although superficial story of the confederacy advance furtherest and last advance into Union lands.  A tour of the this land and that of Antietam brings this compelling and tragic story to life
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|One of the best &#34;hidden gem&#34; movies ever produced. I hope more people will become aware of this great achievement by Spielberg as a director and Christian Bale's first movie role. The transfer to blu ray is absolutely seamless.<br />Rex H
1594202273|5.0|This books is a through examination of our nuclear forces, rationales and actions that both safeguarded and put our country in peril.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Easily one of the best shows ever, Breaking Bad is something I'll watch again, and share with friends who chose not to watch it on TV.  To that end, I have collected the whole set and have the final 8 episodes on pre-order.  The product was perfect, just as described, brand new and factory-sealed.  The price was excellent, the same as I would have paid at Wal-Mart, with free 2-day shipping since I'm an Amazon Prime member.  I highly recommend the set for diehard BB fans like myself.
B00756GKBA|1.0|I'm being generous with just 1 star. After following her career from the start to this, which is the LAST thing I will ever purchase by her. I was more than willing to forgive her dalliance into teeny bopper land with her shock value on some of the songs, but let's face it, this album just sucks. Add to this the insult that she has for her fans at a concert where she makes you wait for 2 to 3 hours and then either warbles, uses lip synching or otherwise drowns out the vocals to ear deafening levels, and we see a legend whose star has faded fast. Yes, there are some hard core fans who will accept her attitude and abuse and that is all well and good. I'm only sorry I didn't learn of her disrespect for fans earlier as I waited way too long to see her in concert. I could have saved my money on artists worthy of my dollar instead of this vain woman who preaches love and then tossed disrespect and disdain at warp speed towards the people who pay her bills. The lyrics of most of these songs defy juvenile mentality. The shelf life of the album overall overstayed its 20 days and its expiration date was truly dead on arrival. It was so bad that I sold it just to get it out of my home. Too bad I can't even give away her earlier stuff because no one seems to want them.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|By the second season, the story is unfolding in surprising ways, with intricate relationships and connections.  Breaking Bad is, IMO, one of the very best TV programs ever made.  Viewers will be interested, amused, frustrated... but never bored.  I was so excited to collect the set that I accidentally ordered two of Season 2. My sister became the lucky recipient of the spare, as she is as much a fan of BB as I am.  I wholeheartedly recommend this series to anyone who wants more substance than what is offered by so-called reality shows.  This drama is, in every way, fantastic.
B0079R9SOG|4.0|This is a very comfortable non-slipping grip that even fits my m43 Lumix GH2.  It takes some trial and error to get the grip adjusted properly, but once you have it adjusted to fit your hand, you can comfortably carry the camera without any fear of dropping it. You do have to flex your hand a little more than normal in order to reach and press the shutter release, but once you get used to it you don't even notice any longer.  The little stand that comes with the B-Grip comes in very handy when you want to sit the camera down.  It keeps you from resting the camera on the lens.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|After the series ended, I really wanted to go back and see it from the beginning.  Having purchased and watched most of the first season, I see a lot of things I missed... making it even more enjoyable than it was originally.  The DVD set was just as described, brand new and factory sealed.  This amazing, innovative series is something I'd recommend to any BB fans as an addition to their DVD collection.  From the first episode to the final one in season 5, Breaking Bad keeps fans engaged. When the final half of season 5 is released later this month, I'll have the whole set.  BB has replaced all my other favorite shows, and for the time being, I'd rather watch reruns of it than the new episodes of other programs.  It is just that good.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|An engaging, enjoyable and light read. Great for a holiday read, nothing earth shattering. Would make a good chic flick.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|buddy guy  live at legends is the real deal.i like his interacting with the crowd.this is buddy guy best cd ever.i saw buddy live,this is how buddy is,he enjoys his work and we  enjoy what he does.he is a great showman and his fans love it.if I could have only one cd this is it.i am going to check out legends soon.enjoy.

B00009QNY4|5.0|just being buddy guy is worth 5 stars.the cd is great buddy has blues tracks,that he is free but .not too wild.nice music to listen to  easy on the ears any blues lover would like like this cd ..
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has created an incredibly deep and believable story here. His use of &#34;Days&#34; to tell the story is particularly interesting-as it brings up more and more questions about the story that are still unclear. I've read this book 4 or 5 times and each time I read it I seem to notice a new detail, appreciate the story more, and come up with lots of new questions about the story!
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Even still at age 28, this is my all time favorite movie.  I was so excited and counted down the days to release as I burnt out my VHS copies a long time ago, and went thru 3 DVD copies I have watched this movie so often.<br /><br />This a very cute Disney Princess movie, must see for every little girl (including us adults who are kids at hearts).  I got this digital version free with my paid DVD/Bluray combo pack...so bonus that I have a digital copy that will last a life time.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A great sequel to The Name of the Wind. Kvothe's world becomes more developed and more believable. Kvothe learns more about the Amyr and the Chandrian, yet seems no closer to a clear answer about who they are and what he will do to find either of them. More questions arise about them, along with questions about the lackless box, Kvothe's mother, the Fae world, and of course-Denna. The pages and pages spent with Felurian seemed to never end-but the parts with the Shaed and Cthaeh seemed important. All the same-I was SO relieved when Kvothe left Felurian and the story seemed to start back up again. Of course, more questions arose back in the present, where Kvothe is telling the story to Chronicler and Bast.
B00E9E4EC8|1.0|This is different from Alan Jackson's other albums, but if it's bluegrass I love it.  We enjoy anything with the name bluegrass.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Perhaps because this was the first installment in a sequence-I found it slow to start with. The world in which is takes place seemed very bland to me, at first...but as the story progressed and the plot became more complicated it became very exciting! Soon I found that I couldn't put it down! Scott Lynch has a way of creating intricate problems that seem impossible for Locke to overcome...and yet he creates solutions that are just at intricate and impossible-yet also believable. I definitely recommend this.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love the game it is one of the best so far!!!  I love the guns and the ameing thing just like I said you should get it its free<br /><br />ASOMNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I play daily. Cant add people on my kindle. Need help! EAVFSCG (kindle) &amp; FAOBYWZ.  Love the game.  I help everybody that send request!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Great way to play piano on the go; I'm definitely in love with this app. Good range of songs to choose from and you do not get harassed from ads.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love the game.  . the adventures are fun.  i like ponies and flowers. it is fun to play keeps getting better
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read, really great ending. I recommend yt? I recommend the book to readers who are ready for unexpected twist.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|After reading other reviews that didn't enjoy the multiple stories without central characters and plot line, I still decided to give it a try. What I really liked about it was how realistic each story was with just enough detail that it let your imagination fill in the gaps. Sometimes less is more when the book lets your imagination do the work, and this book fits that description. I found myself imagining the world...different countries, different philosophies on handling hoards of zombies. Even without main characters like a traditional book, it was a complete story start to finish. Fun read.
B00915G6NK|3.0|Although we enjoy the show overall, especially the characters of Callan, Hanna, Hetty and Deeks, we find the girl Blight way below par for acting skills. Plus, her continual sexual overtones to Deeks is also becoming a bit boring sometimes. Just get on with story fellows without unnecessary spin situation.<br /><br />Additionally, the childish banter between the two (2) computer nerds is also becoming boring. Do not mind a little bit here and there but for about 4-6 chapters it just became inane to say the least.<br /><br />I hope the writers will stick to the story line for next season otherwise we will give it away.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Ok so earlier i asked for a name how you died and if you are a girl or boy awhile later the words debra ledge and nine appeared then although industrial,tracks and rabbit. I think this is real.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|i like having to figure out the different level. pretty fun game for me and my nine year old daughter.
B00CKH9WOQ|3.0|This is my first review on Amazon, and i probably purchased enough items over the years, but i thought i should write something on this doll. My little princess Joy is a monster high girl and i have purchased about 14 of these monster high dolls for here,some on here and others at different stores. The quality of this doll i think is poor, someone in another review wrote pretty much the same thing. Its a cheaper plastic than any of her other Monster High dolls, but i will say she is beautiful,and my grandaughter thinks the same ,she says &#34;its ok Pop,she is made fine and is still is very beautiful&#34;. I gave this doll five stars for its beauty and 1 star for its quality.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|loved the characters in this story . the twists and turns made it a page turner.engrossing,well developed,a must read. enjoyed
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's an awesome series, its like a western set in space.  If you like it check out the movie Serenity.  To bad FOX cancelled it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I've never played these types of puzzles before but I Downloaded this when it was Amazon's free app of the day. I was not disappointed. I was highly addicted to playing these and was very sad to have them end. Great find if you like logic puzzles!
B001BANK32|4.0|wings that rock the cradle edition &#62; the scatman axe version.  obviously, I cannot read, but this collection of printed page is adequate.  for a more better book, look at the printed words in the printed word collection Pet Semetary, the feel good story of the 1980's.  listen to my reviewings.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|This book was not a pleasure to read for me......I can't just walk away I have to finish the read.  The story skipped around and lots of details  I guess to paint pictures but it was over kill. I was very glad when it was over.
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|Great story line, great acting! The directing was superb, the story remained interesting all throughout.  Encouraging story for all to learn from.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Action packed through out the entire movie, choice of super heros, cg making hulk character better every time, Downeys humor, sarcastic demeanor jelled perfectly with cast
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I am having so much fun. This is affecting my time as well as being addicting.  My son loves the animals and he is learning as will build together.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Played the first one, and was waiting for this to show up on kindle! Awesome! Saw the release on Google play and just waited.... hoping it would come love the first one hopefully love this one also!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Well, i just wanted to rate this 3 stars because, you know, the tunes are not all that tuneful or memorable. I bought the cd after seeing the broadway production, so i still had the 'glow'. it's worn off now.<br />Get Monty Python's Spamalot instead. And sing yourself silly all day.
B001CTGQBK|2.0|My grand daughter said that it taught her that a girl has to be a tramp to get a man.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Excellent movie, you feel like you are on das boot, I would watch it again, the subtitles make it fun, you start to pick up some German
B004LROUNG|3.0|While this story had elements of truth it seemed very shallow compared to his other books.  Got it to test downloading from a library.  No bad guys, at least no scary ones in this book
B00E688KA4|5.0|Wao is excelent ,is kool and music is great metal nice grrrrrr viking music love metal day and day yeah grrrrrr
B00005K3NR|5.0|awesome quality and i was having a hard time finding this old movie local .... thank you for offering it online glad I found it.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|This is a classic story that leverages popular culture and contributes equally to it. Fantastic. Definitely a must see movie.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This game took the same idea that so many other games had and manipulated it a little, decided to add so many aspects of paying them, and put stupid crap in to mak you stuck and want to pay. Or delete the stupid thing.
0385535139|5.0|Yet another exciting, Grisham effort!  I couldn't put the book down. The 'hero' proves that money isn't everything in law.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love this series cuz they show not only the rich people's way of life but also what the servants go thru.
038542471X|5.0|What's not to like with a John Grisham book, it's one of my favorites! There was a sincere warmth of affection between the 'attorney' and her young client, like a mother/son relationship.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm 12 and I love this game sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. I just wish that Canterlot was a little cheaper in the store. And that rarity cost bits, not gems. But rarity is a &quot;perfect&quot; pony, sooo it makes sense&hellip; kind of.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun, but needs to be more like the big game hunter I used to play. All the outfitting, walking around, tracking, etc.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Cool game. New levels keeps coming. Can also download characters. Very attractive backgrounds awesome game. Must download this game worthy of .99
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Best written, best acted, best series ever. Just repeat that till you fill enough spaces in the review. Walter White's transformation and Jesse's deliverance are tours de force.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This helped me when I didn't know a word in school thank you very much English dictionary  appreciate too alot
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This app is really fun and I like to play it a lot but I hate that you have to have wifi
B005PK56TA|1.0|Horrible. Absolutely dreadful. I recommend that you drink turpentine and urinate on a brush fire rather than watch this show.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|I have been looking for some thing that gives great ideas for healthy protein meal ideas...so glad I was told about this book.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|This game isn't too bad. It is pretty realistic in several ways. I am not the best gamer, but I enjoy playing it.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This sounds like an incredible collection, but even with everything that's been written about it in the Product Description, I still have a question. Will this set include a standard DVD version? I've already purchased all of the seasons that have been released so far, on DVD. I was planning to get the second part of Season 5 on DVD, when I saw this collection. I don't have a Blu Ray player - just a standard DVD. I'm not anxious to upgrade to a Blu Ray player if this set includes everything in the regular DVD version. Hope someone can help clear this up for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put I'd down. Great job Suzanne Collins. I'm ready for the movie now!!! Rl
B0089LOG02|5.0|Not all settlers arrived at their destinations willingly.  What happened to the unwanted, unloved, displaced children?  Many were sent by train out west, where, it was hoped, they'd be adopted by loving families.  Some were; some were brought into homes as little more than unpaid help.  Sometimes harrowing, sometimes amusing, always touching, we follow a little girl through loss and reinvention.
1885167776|3.0|As a matter of disclosure I received this book as a core reviewer for the 12 Books Group with the expectation that I will post reviews on Goodreads, Amazon, my Blog and participate in the monthly discussion on Goodreads.<br /><br />This book by Gary Kellar and Jay Papasan deals primarily with time management and changing habits. It is a quick read as it does not deal in great depth on either subject. It does present its core ideas in a simple, straight forward manner. The basic premise of the book is that you need to focus on one thing at a time in order to be successful. The authors strive to demonstrate this across a wide range of areas: work life, personal life, family life and spiritual life.<br /><br />They divide the book into three parts: The Lies, The Truth and Extraordinary Results. Each chapter is summarized in a section titled Big Ideas. These are useful in that you can read them without reading the rest of the chapter if you are pressed for time.<br /><br />Gary and Jay also make very good use of charts and figures throughout the book. These also can be scanned for those with limited time as they too present the key concepts of the book.<br /><br />I may have found this book more satisfying if I had not already read other books that covered the subjects in greater detail with more definitive processes. Examples are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and You Best Just Got Better by Jason Womack.<br /><br />I recommend this book to individuals who are looking for a quick read and easy to process tome on time management and changing habits.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Steve Hackett is a true hero in my eyes - not only is he a superb, world-class guitarist spanning many genres, but he has done something which I consider to be of incredible importance -- he has kept alive the amazing, vibrant music of the bygone era (and unfortunately, very maligned and misunderstood by many) of 70's progressive rock.  When the average kid today thinks of the 70's, they probably think of disco, and bubble-gum pop.  But it was also the heyday of bands such as Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes, ELP, and so many others.  And Hackett was there, and helped to create this wonderful repertoire of music - and today, he is staying true to his muse, and showing modern audiences just how amazing some of this music really was (and, sadly, how unbelievably far contemporary music has drifted away from this gold standard, in terms of musicality, originality, virtuosity, and composition).  Bravo, Steve -- the world will truly lose something irreplaceable after you are gone (which, I hope, is not for a LONG time!).
0385349947|5.0|A good friend threatened me if I did not procure and read this book. She claims this is as close to her experience in the world of politics, public policy and sports. I was pretty skeptical until I saw Sheryl Sandberg speak in a TED Talk and I was intrigued.<br /><br />I bought the book and I sat down and read it. It wasn't very long and Sandberg has a very nice style of writing, the lessons flowed and the points were made very clearly and concisely. The book is organized partly as a scholarly study of feminism and a chronicle of women in the upper echelons of the new technology economy, yet it was also an autobiography of Sandberg's career in the highest reaches of politics and technology. It is this juxtaposition which is the most problematic and this is also where she is taking some lumps from conservative women. They were taking her to task for not having written a more traditional tome. The research done on the book was extensive, and perhaps true to Sandberg's background in business, she seemed, at least most of the way through the book, to be making a case in front of the board of directors rather than readers. I think she felt compelled to approach the subject with this kind of tactic because she wanted to fully support her case with full documentation. I appreciated the effort but I struggled my way through the footnotes and figures.<br /><br />It wasn't until after the bulk of the point was made that the narrative flowed, Sandberg got away from the numbers because she was now writing from experience and her full emotional engagement was no long hampered by the statistics, this emancipated her prose to more effectively reflect her own passions and philosophy.<br /><br />So what about the topic? Even though she wasn't completely original with her arguments, it is, after all a very broad subject which has dominated the landscape of the gender wars for quite a few decades. Sandberg makes her points forcefully and does bring a fresh spin to the age old questions. Her own solution to being a mom and a COO is too seemingly easy, and she easily acknowledges the fact that she has the wherewithal and means to resolve her scheduling problems by throwing money at it, she is very well paid. She was also honest and unapologetic about the path she has taken. The point is that you need to do the right thing your own way and that decision is the one that will do more to resolve the problems than anything else.<br /><br />In the end, I think book shares a lot of lessons that are universal and that applies to any minority which are trying to make their way to a position of responsibility. The gender gap focuses the attention clearly and it exposes the rift between the traditionally powerful and those striving to get there. Sandberg's well delivered message rang true with this male who is an ethnic minority just as nicely as it would with a female striving towards the top.<br /><br />I plan on giving this book to every young female professional that I know because I feel very strongly about the topic and I feel like Sandberg has done a great deal towards focusing attention and opening up the discourse on this particular topics.

B004SYP5WC|5.0|Simple, easy to use. A great reminder to help you track your bills. I don't bother putting dollar values in -- I just use it for a due date reminder.
1250030951|3.0|I really liked the way Cath was so awkward and so normal and her relationship with Levi wasn't the kind of inevitable fall in love at first sight thing and then the rest of the book just throws idiotic obstacles to keep them apart. It felt like a real relationship with real doubts and insecurities, even if Levi was a bit of a Gary Stu -- a little too perfect to be believed.<br /><br />What I didn't love was the fannish aspect of it. For someone who isn't just a fan of the Harry Potter stand in Simon Snow, but a Big Name Fan (BNF), Cath spends precious little time doing anything fannish, not even her fanfic writing. And despite the mentions of her online friends, her relationship with them is actually non-existent. A BNF normally has tons of online friends as well as enemies and usually spends an enormous amount talking with them and/or fighting with them because that's how they got to be a BNF to begin with -- it's not just about the writing, it's also about the networking.<br /><br />Another big problem is the way Cath signed up for an advanced fiction writing course and aces her way through it without seemingly ever having written one single other original piece of fiction in her life, or ever reading any other books besides for the Simon Snow series. That just isn't realistic. This makes the ending incredibly unrealistic on a number of levels. The ending also fails to even give a hint of where Cath's relationship with her estranged mother is heading.<br /><br />Rowell's writing is pretty good, though overall it could have benefited from being tightened up. The story was not epic and did not need to be 433 pages.<br /><br />Also, one small thing really annoyed me. There was a reference to \\"Lieutenant Starbuck,\\" which Levi recognized was from Battlestar Galactica. The problem is that in the 2004 reboot, Starbuck was referred to as Lieutenant Thrace. Lieutenant Starbuck is from the 1970s original series. So either Rowell is making reference to a show that not too many people born in 1993 have seen, or she made an error that ought to be corrected in future printings, if there are any.
B000EULJLU|5.0|First of all, who doesn't love TOOL and the packing on the CD makes it worth the buy.  Nope, you can't find it on iTunes and there is a reason.  The packaging alone makes it worth the buy, but then you have this fabulous band.  Great music.  Still love Lateralus the best, however, the songs on here that I love, I can't stop listening to.  Get it!  Rock on.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its a fun adicting game but very frustrating when you have to wait so long until you can play again!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I love playing this game, BUT, you constantly lose your credits, or are not rewarded your winnings because their site is always freezing!!  That's really frustrating when you are spending your money, and never getting them replaced, as it is difficult to get them to respond to your complaints!!  It's such a fun game, so it's really a bummer that these issues exist!
B004UPANGM|4.0|Lots of great stop-motion sequences.  Campbell is at his funniest in the series. A funny movie,, not too scary, but not for the under 12 set.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|I don't really enjoy this game. Usually I don't play it. One time I thought of deleting the app, but i still have it!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell is a true American hero.  It gave me chills reading this book.  If you want an account of what bravery, courage and discipline are all about read this book!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I like the way you could draw on photos. But it's just that I wish that I had a camera.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Secret societies, museums, art, the Internet and  books.  Amazingly covered an  fun.  Recommended for anyone who loves bookstores and  the  web and  discussions about the  big things in life
B00DVPN30A|5.0|I love this new CD!  Amos is a brilliant artist.  I appreciate the different sounds each album brings.  In my opinion, it takes a very talented artist to be able to pull off so many different sounds.  If you don't like this after one listen, I would suggest giving it another try.  I have been listening to it for a week now and every time I hear it I find myself liking it more and more.  Some of my favorite songs are &#34;Johnson Blvd&#34;, &#34;Chill in the Air&#34;, &#34;High Water&#34;, &#34;The Man Who Wants You&#34; and the title track.
1781162646|5.0|I love Stephen King.  I try to buy every hardback or paperback he has ever written. Joyland was a quick read and a good one.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This product is great and was represented as it is. I would recommend it to anyone.I am very satisfied with the product.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|J.J Abrams, and his cast, scores again in this resurrection of the classic series. This is 'The Wrath Of Khan' for the new millennium. And that's not faint praise considering what a fine film the original was. It's my hope, now that Abrams has moved on to Star Wars, that Paramount will find a director of the same caliber to continue the series.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|This product is great and was represented as it is. I would recommend it to anyone.I am very satisfied with the product.
B00D3PYQT0|5.0|This series has a lot of intrigue and makes one eager to watch the next episode, great acting and I am  looking forward to season 4.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its a very additive game. Some levels get to be very hard took me months to get through a few but all together a good game.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|...so wanting to tell THIS story is why Card really wrote &#34;Ender's Game&#34; in the first place. So interesting, because identifying with and loving that wonderful idea of a child that I met when I first read the story &#34;Ender's Game&#34; is the reason I wanted to read this story about Ender, and the reason I've read all the stories about Ender and his friends and family and life and everything about Ender's games.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. It is well written, compelling, moves quickly & it handles several kinds of relationships, parental, love, sibling & professional. The author immediately made me interested in Louisa, an ordinary, less than average girl (when compared to her sister) who was headed for a luster less life in a small town. This  skillfully told, compelling story captures the emotional & behavioral changes of everyone, including Louisa who loves or becomes involved in the care, survival & new limitations of an accomplished young man who survived an accident that left him quadriplegic. The author deftly weaves love, morality & legal issues into his choice of assisted suicide  & challenges the reader's position that may be based on morality or social & legal expectations. In addition and simultaneously, Moyes keeps us interested in sibling rivalry, parental deference  and romantic love. A sweet love story that leaves you nostalgic while at the same time, addresses a major issue of the day, assisted suicide.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addicting!! enjoy the game. I compete with my hubby trying to pass him Up. love love love this game always recommend it
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|The songs are beautiful, and Celine has dynamic singing voice.  She also staged the different vocal presentations with scenes that left a lasting impression on my mind.
B00DQ8GDV8|5.0|Great book that sheds a light on the history of mankind, and what caused some nations to be more dominant and successful than others. Particularly interesting is that these differences had nothing to do with the people themselves...
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Amazing album from beginning to end, with a dynamic do of collaborations. This album will remind you why fell in love with music.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have seen the series thus far and have to give them their dues of how closely they have followed the book and cannot wait to continue!
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Think it does a pretty good Job I'm still learning it. Just wish it had flash so I can take pictures in a darker room
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I agree, this game is one of the best that I have ever played. However, the game has little power ups that I really like to use sometimes. The game is very challenging, which is great, but I also like the option of the power ups, but they go so fast that they aren't worth the money.<br />Just my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. Not too difficult but gets you to using your brain. Passes the time by when having to wait.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it so far but glitches out on me sometimes but overall I like it. I would reccomand this game
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is pretty fun but it should be a little different fok kindle since we waited a long time to get this app
B007EC27QM|3.0|This is a simple calculator that does only the most basic operations, but looks clean and tidy and is quick to load.  So why only three stars?  When used on a tablet, it forces orientation to one mode only; it won't flip around and reformat for landscape or portrait or being upside down.  Both the stock and a recent FAotD called NeoCalc work in any orientation.<br /><br />So this is nice enough on a phone that's always in portrait mode, but if you need greater flexibility or more functions, look elsewhere.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great but when is the next  update. When will we be able to use Redstone?  Mojang  should lower the price for the computer version
B001DM1VXE|3.0|This is a deep and thought-provoking movie, but it wouldn't be my top choice if you're looking for something accessible to several friends. It's difficult to get into, but explores some beautiful themes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love to play this game all the time.  It's fun and compelling, but challenging once you get into the harder levels.  I recommend this game for lots of people!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I love will smith, but at first I was skeptical because his son was in it and I wasn't sure how good his acting would be!  However I watch the movie with an open mind and I was very impressed the movie was excellent!  The graphics were good and my kids enjoyed it as well!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Good family entertainment. A classic in the true sense of the word. Julie Andrews is a fine actress and have always like Dick Vandyke.
0143124838|5.0|I have no idea what the other reviewers are thinking/expecting! Alexa wrote the book in a series of emails to herself at various stages of her life.. It's meant to be more like an inspirational scrapbook. I feel the book is a reflection of who she is, it's got photos, anecdotes, advice.. It's like her journal. Very cool, quick read. A must for any fan of hers
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|What an uneventful ending to a great start!<br />The evolution of the main characters leads nowhere, and by the end of the book the author leaves many unanswered questions, and seems frankly bored.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a awesome game I absolutely. Love it. It is my number one favorite game 4stars. You would think that a running game would get boring after a while but nope especially not with all the cool updates.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Wow!  Great series!  Actors, scripts are sensational!  I think Sherlock Holmes matches Arthur Conan Doyle's original creation but in the modern world!  Highly recommend!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|i love fairway so happy its on aneroid  device  now. I love love. this game. Fairway golf is the best.
B0081336FO|5.0|I was worried that season 2 couldn't match season one- but it was even better. I can't wait for season 3!  The writing and production values for this series are very high!  Love it!
B0000AM6JI|4.0|Al Pacino a very good actor. I like alot of his movies. A very good movie to buy . I will watch it over and over.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app, the game is not the problem, the problem is me!!!!!!! Cause I can not get past level 17!!! :(
B00005N5RM|4.0|The Blob , saw both , Like this one better than the first one. Shawnee Smith , is another actress I like to watch.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have always loved divergent since it first came out, even preordered allegiant on my kindle. As I started  to read, I found  myself becoming confused regarding which character had the point of view. The plot was stupid and endless. I thought Thu  book as OK until the end.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />I have to admit, I was in tears after Tris and URIAh died. I felt that they were unnecessary and that Veronica roth really just dropped a bomb on her readers. She had spent two she books already tracing Tris, only to make her die in the end? Pointless!!<br />We had grown to love Tris for being strong, but vulnerable,kind but cruel. Only to have her die? I think that Caleb should actually have redeemed.himself.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|I own All 3 The Thing . From the time I could buy movies . I bought the ones I like .
B006M4F67A|5.0|Can be played on the phone of your choice but good glasses or eyesight. Needs a larger screen but i like it
B00CVDXAAG|4.0|Book in good condition.  I know the book is used and the cover and pages are bent, but it's not in excellent condition so I couldn't give it a perfect rating.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|You'll get a good insight into a totally different culture governed by Islamic law. I never understood what that &#34;HONOR&#34; thing was all about.<br />Her first and foremost teacher was her own father who accepted that baby girl with an open heart.<br />The father-daughter team, supported by her mother, fought endlessly for a better Education, especially for girls.<br />Malala will never stop being an advocate for girls' education.<br />It will be interesting to observe her future path.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good and challenging app.  Not too hard but sometimes takes a while.  I like the different ways to try to trick you.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Got here on time, which I great. The series itself just keeps surprising me. Everything is in upheaval and just keeps changing.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Lemmy and the boys have once again delivered the goods.  Motorhead is a constant source of incredibly solid material.  They know what their fans want and they always find a way to give it to them.  This album is hard, heavy and in your face.  Just the way you want it.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Fantastic. I just could not put down the book till I finished.Kept on wondering what was going to happen to Abra.Will there be a follow up to this book?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Was unable to play certain videos on web version until I got this application so all problems fixed using this application. Just took a little time to get used to it
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Wonderful packaging!<br /><br />Awesome extras.<br /><br />Incredible Deleted Scenes.<br /><br />Perfect behind the scenes videos!<br /><br />One of the best Blu-ray releases of the present times. For one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the last decade!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Creativec storyline, just the right balance of HO scenes &amp; adventure. Just wish the mini-games were a bit more challenging.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I have always loved Pollyanna and this is a continuation of what happened after the accident. I would recommend this book to teens as well as adults
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Once you get high enough in the levels it really makes you think. I would recommend playing. A great game when traveling.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I've played this on my DS and loved it but now because it's on my kindle fire hd it's even awesomer than ever!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the book but it did not live up to some of his books such as Pelican Brief or A Time To Kill. I will still buy future Grisham books.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It needs pictures<br />I recommend this to a boring person<br />Send me comments at landonwhitley8@gmail.com no longer than 10 words 20 words are to long
B007REV4T8|3.0|One of the worst 007's I have ever seen. Slow....Stopped in a few places and stuck. Had to wait for it to clear the area on the tape
B003NB8KE6|4.0|I'm about a 31&#34; waist 5'10&#34; with slightly shorter legs so got the medium. Length was slightly long so has a little bunch up around the ankles but nothing that affects the function nor looks too much. Width was about right but not very tight. Just gave light to moderate support.<br /><br />It still did help recovery while sleeping in them at night and they are very comfortable to sleep in with the fit. I may try a small next time to get extra support and hopefully recovery as I typically go with small cycling kit all around so may be that my body shape is more suited to that.<br /><br />Overall happy with the purchase.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Great movie.. loved it...made it here in great time. Good condition.......I really loved the movie where I would watch it again.
B00FN811SY|5.0|The JW Library app includes six Bible translations and features the brand new 2013 revision of  the New World Translation of The Holy Scriptures. The New World translation is extremely well documented, as a work of serious scholarship should be. It is in a natural and easily readable modern English, a key benefit of any translation. The New World Translation Committee has restored the divine name, represented by the Tetragrammaton (rendered \\"Jehovah\\" in English), which appears nearly 7000 times in the original Hebrew Scriptures. It is loaded with footnotes that confirm alternative readings of the various original language texts. It contains a very instructive appendix and glossary. And since navigation is critical in a complex multi-Bible app like this, I especially enjoy the ease with which you can select the Bible of your choice, then select a specific Bible book and chapter. While viewing a chapter, you can tap a verse number and instantly compare how the available Bible versions render this single text. You can also tap a footnote marker or reference letter - and quickly view the associated material side by side with the Bible text. In addition to all these features, I also appreciate that - among the six Bible translations offered - this app includes both the King James Version and the American Standard Version.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Very entertaining!  It was a rainy day, this kept us entertained, and involved.  Not a boring movie.  Watch on a big screen with surround sound!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP! There is no better way to start the day than with something positive. This app allows me to off with blissful, positive affirmations to start my day off on a positive note. I FEEL ENERGIZED  and ready to take on the day and any challenges it offers. It is a bargain at any price. It is a must have!
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|My 9 year old son and I were really enjoying this game until we suddenly became completely unable to access it.  Game now loads up on a prompt to purchase stuff for the game for real money.  This screen is not responsive to touch and eventually just boots us out.  I was hoping there would be an update that would fix the problem,  but so far no luck.<br />Also when playing the game when it was working the game drained the kindle battery faster than we could charge it.

B00E9E4EC8|4.0|This is kind of a different sound for Jackson but overall a very likeable endeavor. I like it a lot.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Unreal that this sort of thing happened right here in Minnesota. Amazing stories - makes me want to learn more about it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|There are few movies that teens and grandparents can appreciate. There are few movies that I care to watch multiple times. Do not miss this movie. Do not. Enough said.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Others have given you the plot specifics, so I wont go into that.  This is one of my favorite books, and I go through life with a book in my hand.  The characters are so well written, that if you saw them on the street, you would instantly know them. They are real. It is full of little details --like moss in the baby basket, that add such depth and meaning.<br />The character's lives are hard, as are most of ours, in one way or another.  The characters deal with their lives as best as they can, in their own ways, and find that even if they are damaged, there is a good life for them.<br />A must read<br />Hoping for more work from this author
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This is such a cute game for kids I just had to let everyone know about it. Its colourful, bright and interactive and keeps the little ones occupied.<br /><br />I really like the idea that the user has to build the letters of the alphabet and my three year old found it very exciting and loved the little crab helpers and was even repeating the letters out loud after completing each letter.<br /><br />This is a safe and fun app for small kids and the cost of the app is nothing against the hours of fun and learning..
B00CL0J99K|3.0|it is a bit of a stretch.  I have the first two movies and this just didn't blend in with them.  I would however bought the 3D version had Amazon offered it at time of purchase.  Maybe in 3D it would have been a bit more entertaining.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show on TV, glad to hear 5th season approved, the zombies seemed to have multiplied this season, crew will need to leave prison.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Love every and anything Beatrice Potter and this is so good !<br />Great acting and a wonderful, sensitive and moving movie version  of this brilliant and creative writer's life and works.<br />Highly recommend.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I liked the game but it was really scary, the slender man scares me a lot , he is a really creepy looking guy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Such  fantastic talent.<br />She really transports you to the heavenly realms with her voice.<br />Highly recommended to all music lovers.
B0044DEAUA|1.0|My speaker on my phone works better than this product.  It has really poor quality, people sound like they are in a fish bowl, also the blue tooth will work on one phone call then the next phone call will go to directly to my phone and I  have to go into settings and reconnect to the blue tooth again.  Not cool to have to do when driving.  I also have to pull down from visor and use as this speaker phone as a handheld to hear people or have them hear me.  This is a very poor and disappointing product.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller came quickly, in great condition, and works fantastic! It was a much better deal than buying at a local game store, with all the quality.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Great show even my kids love it. We don't watch a lot of TV. We don't even have cable just a roku, How I Met Your Mother is one of the few shows we all love,
B00DNDR29I|5.0|I've been waiting for Ms. Monae's follow-up to The ArchAndroid.  I've listened to it a few times and I haven't put it away yet.  Like the song with Prince and the one with Erykah Badu.  Props to Janelle.  Good sophomore release.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|The Croods are funny and different! I am sure most everyone will enjoy them! There is not much out there about the Cavemen!
B00AB7HESI|2.0|This app is fun and challenging. You get to type what you think of<br />To solve problems! I highly recommend this app.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|A bit easy at first but then it really challenges the mind as the game advances. I've been hooked on this for the last couple of days.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|He continues the traditional Camel Club series here with a good read and the addition of a few more characters. Read the series first and you will enjoy this book.
159463176X|3.0|Little echo, slow paced, and somewhat boring.  It started out strong but the characters failed to connect and left me wanting more.
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|This documentary should be required viewing for all high school history classes. It illustrates in many ways how the lessons of history are lost on some policy makers today. It also illustrates how a great man can be destroyed if he is loyal to a fault.
140006922X|4.0|Small book with a powerful story.  Little is really known of Jesus and his myth continues to rise.  This book should be required reading for anybody truly concerned about Christianity.
0345529057|4.0|The best series to watch and bought this for my son to read. I do think I need to borrow his books.
0307460444|4.0|Have yet to try out some of the recipes. Some of the ingredients are hard to get here. Nevertheless, the illustration is just as sumptuous.
B007RQ6WCA|2.0|Dropbox is a great idea; linking to it via AntTek is not. I rarely use it because the link is too complicated.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game drives me crazy I hate how you can be on one level forever then pass through other levels so easily<br />Also I wish that the lives for the game would come back quicker or after so many levels instead of getting extra moves we could get the things you have to pay for instead
B007W4OZ76|2.0|It does not load. I installed it as an entry point to Dropbox, but on the rare occasions when I can load it, the path to Dropbox is circuitous and confusing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I THINK THIS GAME ROCK'S IT'S SO MUCH FUN AND YES WE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR IT TO COME ON THE KINDLE FIRE HD HOPE U GUYS INJOY THE GAME IT'S SO EASY I COULD PLAY ALL NIGHT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This game is so cool!!!!!!! Here's a good tip about it&middot;&middot;&middot; It helps you learn more about how to play any song U want!!!
B008M0NDOK|1.0|It won't work on anything whatsoever. I downloaded and purchased the games listed on the compatibility list, and this piece of crap doesn't even work. Complete waste of money. Thank you.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Awesome finale, couldn't ask for something better and was worth the wait. Hopefully will get to read Seth's story and there's still a titan that needs to be catch
B0064MGU98|5.0|I missed watching this, so I started season 1 from the beginning. I love it and it is so convenient to watch on my Kindle Fire or IPad wherever I am.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|This product is fantastic! !! I will continue to order from amazon.my movie was funny absolutely great. ..it wasnt hard for me to purchase the movie
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this years ago in college, and it stands up.  King crafts his stories so well.  He brings in themes and leitmotifs that resonate throughout.  In The Shining, one of those leitmotifs is &#34;the pup&#34; who has to &#34;take his medicine.&#34;<br /><br />I re-read The Shining because I just read Dr. Sleep, and realized I needed to reacquaint myself with the Torrances.  So I re-read The Shining and then re-read Dr. Sleep, because I knew it would make so much more sense this time.  Danny Torrance is a wonderful character.  Everybody needs to get to know Danny Torrance as King originally portrayed him, not the half-wit Kubrik made him out to be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this product wish we could down load on kindle this is tje best game ever to play love this game
B0043XUXS4|5.0|PG was really finding his way on this the 3rd of his Peter Gabriel albums.  Further stepping away from the great music with Genesis, world music continues to make its mark on the rhythms in many of the songs.
B006LG7O38|4.0|Terrific stars, great pastiche of other vampire movies, fun to see Anton Yeltsin in pre-Star Trek movie. David Tennant in briefs & a short silk kimono is a treat.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Season 4 pulls you in from the beginning! Great story!  Great drama! Great action!  Awesome zombie killing! &#34;Rick Grimes Mode&#34; just took it up a notch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicted to this game!  Love the daily challenge and game continues to keep me motivated to play on a daily basis.
B000OCXIDK|3.0|not that good; the historical novel should be more accurate in its historical facts and the story is not very believable; being a fan of vermeer's paintings, i am not an admirer of the way he was rendered in this book
B00BVYNSLC|2.0|The premise was good but after the first half hour, I was concerned. The writing and acting just don't cut it, and the typical nudity and sex scenes ensued to make up for the lack. I do not intend to watch another episode.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting, wonderful story lines and characters you really come to love. While watching this series you forget it is a television show. You feel like you're watching real lives with their real ups and downs.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The Second season seduces the viewer even more effectively than the first one and positions the audience for what must certainly befall the family in the 3rd season. As an avid Borgia and Renaissance history buff, I am pleased to see that there is a thread of truth in it...and it is not pristine.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Not as good than Daniel Craig's first, Casino Royale appearance as superspy James Bond, but a marvelously slick adventurer with all the hot visuals the series promises, its most feral star, and a weirdo performance by villain Javier Bardem that misfires as badly as Christopher Walken in A View to a Kill.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The historical time period portrayed in this book shows how harshly slaves and their families were treated.  I enjoyed the read, but was hoping for some &#34;lightness&#34; to counter all of the tragedy.  However, I do believe it's a worthwhile read which shows a true perspective of this time period.  The storyline was well written, and the characters well-developed.  I would recommend this book on the list of books to read.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Hard to tell a romance tale with a lead character in a mask every appearance, but this Alan Moore comic series translates to film much better than his &#34;Watchman&#34; series did.
B003WAV02M|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! THIS MOVIE IS LIKE WATCHING A MOB BOSS OR A BIG TIME DRUG DEALER BUT DOES THE DIFFERENCE IS INSTEAD OF DRUGS HE DOES IT WITH GUNS
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The Star Trek franchisees get every facet, nuance, and rule of the series exactly wrong. A lusty, newlywed Spock who casually disobeys orders? Not on your dilithium crystals! An Enterprise crew that commits mild mutiny in their first appearance on the bridge? Tell me it's a bad dream.
1451666179|5.0|Brilliant! The Hyperbole and a Half is one of the shiniest gems of the internet and this book is every bit the treasure the blog is. There are a few old favorites from the blog reprinted here, but most of the book is new content. It's got zany childhood adventures, journeys of self-discovery, and dog stories. Oh yes, lots of dog stories! Allie's art may seem deceptively simple at first, but it actually has so much nuance and single frames can send you into gales of laughter all on their own, even independent of the story as a whole.  Even the acknowledgements and About The Author page are funny.<br /><br />Such a hilarious book!
B001QOGYBI|4.0|One of Roaul Dahl's great Thurberesque morality plays starring only slightly anthropomorphized foxes and badgers. Great restraint in the computerized graphics and animation plus detailed readoing by the human actors on voice, led by George Clooney.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Addictive game that is a lot of fun to play. It just wicks you in and doesn't let go. Try it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game is okay, but I'm more worried about my kindle fire.  The game froze it.  I finally got it back, but I'm still scared to go on it. I also just don't get the purpuse of the game. I'm good at it, but I just wish it had<br />more things to do on it. If you want to freeze or lose your kindle, play this game. But just remember<br />that every kindle is different.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Omg i didnt expect this to be so addictive! I couldnt put it down. I just wanted to try it and now i am done. Really fun game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love it omg its so awesome i love it i love it i love it share stuff and get recipes and how tos
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Loved the series and having this set with all the extras makes it even more fun to watch .My favorite reason to watch was to see if I could figure out who were the 12 Clyons. Now I am following the pre-quels to see how they got to this point
B004SEUJ82|3.0|It was a good good movie. I really enjoyed it a lot. I leaned so much from it! Great movie!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a fun product.  Got one for me and just ordered one for my dad.  Great for YouTube and Netflix and my dad likes watching European videos on YouTube.  Really easy to set up.
B00E193TM2|5.0|love love love this album. it is great to work out to and lift weights to. i can't wait to order their other albums.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I've really enjoyed this game. It has some fun twists that keep it interesting. It works great on my kindle fire hd.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I didn't like the timeouts and waiting for new lives.  This game could be a money pit for each time you are required to purchase new lives or wait twenty minutes to continue to play.  Otherwise the game was enjoyable.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|This movie is SCARY. However, there is a major oddity in the plot--one that I'm at a loss to identify as deliberate or a flaming error (relating to the little boys)--that prevents me from giving it the five stars I'd otherwise bestow. Overall, though, the movie does what a sequel should: It adds to the original story of Katie and her demonic friend and raises new questions about the purpose of their association. I look forward to the next installment of the series, even if only to find out whether the issue of the kid is addressed.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Compelling stories about everyday lives in North Korea. It does exactly what it says on the cover. Also highly recommend the Aquariums of Pyongyang.
0515142247|5.0|Reacher lives!  And, Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher is a joke.  He's not remotely Jack Reacher.  There are much better choices.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|Sophomoric. Might appeal to prepubescent middle school girls.  Theme is blatantly obvious. It's no 1984 and Eggars is no Orwell.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Really interesting story, but pulled together in a jerky way instead of flowing. I had the feeling that this book was writen in a hurry, on the heals of his other fabulous successes.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Love it! can't stop listening to it..so need this music in these days and times. Thanks Robert and everyone apart of this project
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Great exciting easy read.  I wanted to go right into the next book in the series!  And I did just that!
B00000DNCF|5.0|Purchased it only for the SOMMS cd and it was worth it. It has 4 great tracks and plus the excellent live song of &#34;Slaves & Bulldozers&#34;. Badmotorfinger is always going to be the most underrated and most outstanding Soundgarden album.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|SPOILER ALERT: Typically well-done King--easy to read, a page-turner. As he has done before, he effectively created a hidden world in our midst.The denouement lacked suspense and thrills, however--the outcome was never in doubt.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It's a great way to exercise your mind. It doesn't hurt that you get to beat your friends, too.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Although it wouldn't work when I first received it, after taking it apart to find and fix a broke wire, it is what I wanted.
B00C9G22R2|1.0|I wish it was in English and not with so much subtitles,really makes it hard to enjoy the movie.rather have it in English.
0394800184|5.0|My parents and grandparents used to read this toe when I was a little boy, and now I read it to my daughter. I love this book!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Sad. Happy. Angry. Hopeful. I experienced all these emotions while reading this book. I love a book that can do that for me. The only complaint I have is the ending.  I would've liked another chapter or perhaps an epilogue.
B000OLX4SU|4.0|Superior. This movie is the truest to the book (which you should read. I was amazed the old black and white Frankenstein had almost NOTHING in common with the actual story). The closest to the book before now was The Bride of Frankenstein (also, not very close).<br />The movie feels a bit emotionally exaggerated, like a 50's romantic movie, but it is definately worth watching.The movie does make some odd changes (I will let you find out). I always wonder why the director would say \\"I will make this move faithful to the book\\" (after all it has survived hundreds of years) then change parts of it....?<br />I think the monster was miscast and a poor fit; Dinero is short and his style clashes with the personality of the monster. I think Dolph Lundgren would have been a good choice (stop laughing). His accent would have made him seem exotic. He is also quite brilliant (PhD in chemistry) which is a fact often ignored.<br />This movie is good at showing how miserable and innocent the \\"monster\\" was and how judgemental and prickish Frankenstein was. Why not just give the poor thing a companion (the book explains the answer to this question, but I don't agree with it)? Who doesn't want someone to share things with. For a \\"god\\", Victor was quite superficial.<br /><br />++I really appreciated the glimpse of Obamacare, shown to us when the film involves a clinic giving vaccinations to the public.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Disney is my life so when I herd this movie was coming oh in this giant cbo pack I knew I had to get it!! I went from store to store looking for this one and finally decided to just get it off of here. I was upset to not have it in my hand the day of but it shipped so fast that I was able to have it within two days by using just the normal shipping! The digital copy is awesome and the bluray is absolutely phenomenal! When you watch it in bluray you get lost in the movie all over again just like the first time you watched it. I just can't believe I have it. GET IT!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book sucks!!!!! It is really hard to read. I would not recommend this book. It is hard to find the word you need to look up.
B008JFUPZI|5.0|I noticed most of the negative reviews are from those who are comparing R.I.P.D. with other films.  This isn't Ghostbusters or Men in Black it is R.I.P.D. and it is a great fun film.  If you want those other movies, then watch those other movies and stop the negative comparisons.<br /><br />Yes you have seen the story a thousand times before and will probably see it a thousand times more.  It's the good guys against the bad guys with the fate of the world in the balance.  Of course the good guys are newly partnered and don't like each other in the beginning of the film, but are best buddies by the end.<br /><br />If you are looking for an amusing, enjoyable, and entertaining way to spend about an hour and a half I would highly recommend watching R.I.P.D.  It has a great cast, a crazy twisted plot, better than expected special effects and lots of snappy winsome humor.<br /><br />This film isn't going to win any Oscars or a Nobel Prize or change the world in any significant way; however it will take your mind off your troubles for 96 minutes and add a little fun to your day.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Very very bad movie.  A waste of money and especially time.  Break it down to 12 minutes of highlights and it would be okay
0375703764|5.0|This book... gets in your head.  It has such a menacing presence, part of which comes from the fact that you're not really sure 'why' it gets to you.  Stories within stories within stories - they all kind of wrap around each other, intermingling, while still existing autonomously.  This is definitely an odd experience.  This book will definitely have it's way with your mind - without all that annoying snuggly stuff.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Great movie. A must see! But wish it was more like the book. But definitely a good watch. Fast zombies suck...lol.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I cannot stop playing this game.  It is so deliciously addicting!  After a stressful day at work it is fun to lose myself in some mindless fun.
B009DTI0IS|5.0|Perfect ! If your a Pearl Jam fan than this is a must for your collection and to see.Hopefully they have many more years ahead of them. Not to mention we love our home grown son Eddie Vedder...Chicago rules!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love it I re read and re read them I just love them that much<br /> I can't wait for the movie to come out
B0043D2FB2|5.0|The Angutara Nikaya is a key compilation of sutras for those who want to begin or even deep one's understanding about Buddhism. Bikku Boddhi did a tremendous job,  as usual.
0590129279|5.0|One of my favorite book of all times. Every one should read this, not just kids. Make sure you get the original.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|They just keep getting worse. Let me just say. I thought the first one was great. The second one was bad and this one was much worse. The dialog between the transformers was a joke and made me laugh.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Enjoyed the game but wish it built in difficulty. Out of the dozens of puzzles, only a handful were challenging.<br /><br />On the plus side, I appreciate the simplicity of the interface, making quick play a breeze.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Just started using this game, so maybe I'm still waiting for the really fun and interesting parts. So far it's seems kind of kid stuff easy, without much complexity to make it fun. Tutorial kind of stinks as it just tells you what to do, without telling why or explaining any of the meters at the top of the screen. Still can't find the energy meter.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Found this actually pretty creepy. Good atmosphere, much better than the average horror movie. Now I have to write more words because my opinion wasn't verbose enough for Amazon.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's not easy to build a good game for phones/tablets, and I'm very picky about the ones I choose to play. Hungry Shark Evolution is one of the BEST I've ever experienced - especially if you're a shark fan! I love the RPG elements that have been incorporated into the gameplay. Not only do your sharks level up as they gain experience (from eating fish, scuba divers, etc.), but once you max out your current shark, you can attain the next beast. You go from a modest Reef Shark all the way to the Great White, and you can even unlock the Megalodon, a prehistoric, monstrous fish the size of a house (and one that can eat boats!). This leveling system adds awesome replay and tangible results to your progress.<br /><br />The game handles beautifully with the virtual d-pad (amazingly), perhaps because your movements underwater do not have to be quite as precise as in something like a platforming game. I had less success with the tilt controls (which is actually the recommended setting), but I'm an school gamer who has always had a controller in my hands. Your shark's movements are fun to watch, especially his \\"chomping\\" animation, as he gobbles up whatever fish he can find. Visually, the game is a treat, looking like a well drawn cartoon.<br /><br />This game is free, but I would have been happy to pay a few bucks for it - it's well worth it! There is the option to purchase in-game apps, but I never found that to be necessary in the slightest. They are mostly fun items or shortcuts (top up your coins/gems), but you never need to buy them. I only played for a few hours over a couple weeks, and I was able to unlock the biggest beast (Megalodon) simply by playing the game and having fun.<br /><br />Future Games of London (FGOL) developed this game, and they did an outstanding job! I will definitely have them on my radar for other titles. I also hope they add some more content to Hungry Shark Evolution, perhaps with a new map or something. Keep up the good work, guys!
B007BVMVDU|4.0|I've read all the books. The portrayals are good and almost as addictive as the books.  Some of the Americans trying to have British accents are distracting and some of the necessary truncating of the story line to make it fit into a TV series is annoying. Also, the unnecessary flaunting of nudity is distracting from the story. But overall, the TV series almost lives up to the books. Not quite, but almost.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|All the stories are very well written and keeps the reader ready to turn the next page. I have enjoyed all the  stories.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|After purchasing the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 based on several off-Amazon recommendations, I was disappointed when the first mic stopped working after a month. In need of a replacement, I ordered a second mic, thinking that the defective first mic was a fluke.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was wrong - the second mic stopped working after the first use. It was at that point I went back and read the reviews from people who have had similar experiences. It seems that the failure rate on this mic is pretty high.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this album as much as I do. I'm not big on bands with thick accents. Or rather, I thought I wasn't! I can't find a track on here that I don't like. Very much worth your time.
B004KKX814|5.0|I purchased this toy for my son. He loves it! It was quite the learning experience for me to keep up with his Beyblade fascination. In case you (the adult) is unaware, the each Beyblade has different powers and I think (just my hunch) that may determine what type of 'tip' the Beyblade are given. These toys are essentially tops that have been made 'cool' with it's story line (and cartoon show) and the the use of the 'launcher' instead of making the tops spin the old fashion way. These Beyblades are 'assembly' required and comes with a ratchet tool. I didn't realize it until my son had a few other Beyblade, but the Beyblade can be taken apart to be combined with other Beyblade components to make a 'customized' Beyblade. He and his friends do this quite often and they love to have 'BeyBattles' in their 'BeyStadium'. It's nice to watch him get so much enjoyment from playing with an actual toy instead of playing a video game.
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|Amusing, but pales in comparison to Kenneth brannagh's film which is superior in every way.: cinematography, interpretation, but especially in casting
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I have it for my kindle fire and is one of the best hunting games I have played! worth it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is chalenging and the sounds keep you going. Been waiting to be able to play on my Kindle. Love it
B003YMNVCA|5.0|This is a great book for an individual wanting to learn the basics of Unix/Linux Administration. One will walk away from this book with the basic knowledge to speak intelligently about the various Linux distros. I highly recommend following along with a distro of your own as I've found that much of Unix/Linux administration is experiential.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great price but too limit for android streaming (netflix and YouTube only).  Very fast and convenience for movie.  Excellence price for sure
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Simply breathtaking. I couldn't put this book down until the very last word. I will be beginning the second book of the series in a matter of moments.
0688014291|5.0|This book offers insight on getting the most productivity out of yourself and others. In fact many corporations recommend employees to read this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga Game is great. I am having a ball playing everywhere there is a wifi. thanks for the fun.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is a good book. If you like fantasy and fiction this is your book. Rick Riordan is a good author. Amazing book. You should read this book. The book says the h word ,but other than that.... it is a good book.
B002T3LHG2|5.0|I don't buy many songs or albums online, but I bought this one because I love it! :) I would totally recommend it to you!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Really really good book! Recommend all 3 of these series. Love how this one ended on a sad but complete part.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I don't love too many music albums all the way through, but I do love pretty much every single song on this one. Would recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the strategy of the game. However, the only disappointment is the fact that you only get 5 lives and either have to pay for more or wait 2 hours to play again. If I have 15 minutes to play I want to play THE game, not play games waiting around.
B009SESFY2|4.0|Bought this for my high school daughter who has so much going on that sitting quietly to read anything other than text books for homework is a challenge. She listens to these audio CDs while she is cooking or doing dishes so it is worth every penny!
B001EC2ISA|4.0|I consider this movie a classic and was excited to share it with my daughter.  We were looking for movies around Halloween that were a little haunted but not too scary and Beetlejuice fits that to a tee!  Perfect for family movie night.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I loved season one, it had a story line and a little bit of sympathy for the characters.  Season two was much more intense and graphic, and at times I found it difficult to watch.  But watch I did!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the playful banter that goes back and forth between the characters!  I smile the whole time I read their witty jokes. All in good fun. I could read series forever!
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|Disney and Pixar do it again with the prequel to monsters Inc. Mike , Sulley and the gang put on a great show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love the ending!! This is a series I can read all over again and again. The chemistry between the characters is perfectly written.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved the newest of the Star Trek movies Great special effects and the actors did a great job in portraying the Star Trek Tradition to a new generation.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|IM SO GLAD MY SISTER ENCOURAGED ME TO KEEP READING!! I paused because I don't normally read romance novels of they are graphic.. I would have SERIOUSLY missed out on this great series! I became so involved in the chemistry of this couple. My life will never be the same!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Another great cog in the run of 007 movies keeps you on the edge of your seat and brings back some old friends and gadgets to mix with the new.
B0001I561E|5.0|The movie included the development of first young love in two people's lives, with a mixture of good times and not-so-good times, and of course, a happy, positive ending.  Walt Disney has a name for good movies about people---both good and not-to-good, about the rich and the not-so-rich.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|Great movie! My 2 year old loves it. Lots of cute animals and things. Well worth the purchase. Came quickly.
B0094K1K42|2.0|I rented this because i love Charlese Theron...but this movie was very disappointing. The plot got a little boring and in the end, I felt like it was a waste of my time.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this book down.  You experience humanity both at its worst and at its best. A time in history that should bring much shame
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is quite handy for quick math, like figuring out bills,etc...  I love the large font size on the buttons too.  I use it all the time!
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Hello,<br />  How are you?<br />I am very pleased with HAPPY FEET 2.<br />I LOVE IT.<br />  Thank you so much for asking.<br />  YOU GUY'S ARE GREAT. ...<br />I want MEET THE ROBERTSON next.<br />  I LOVE YOY GUY'S..  THANK YOU;<br />  Tina<br />( I am your number 1 fan- ALL- WAYS )
B000NNPT8C|1.0|Friends convinced me to watch Saw II and III for Halloween.  Too much blood and torture and the premise I found offensive, but I don't want to add spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|Great book..really thought provoking in the way he gets into the heads of all the characters .. No blame given to either side of a very unhappy time
B007SGM084|5.0|Really what can be said about Mr. Grey. We aim to please! love the books and look forward to the movie!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|A wonderful but all too short series. on a par with mash, seinfeld, fawlty towers and the like in that the characters were believable, rounded and the writing and acting garnered empathy. sorry to have only a few of these gems but they went out on the very top! serenity is their legacy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ist little hard but it is interesting.  Also there's a lot of levels. To keep you busy.  Have fun playing it. It's worth your money
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Plot slow to develop. CG may be impressive at time of release, unconvincing 10 years later.  Free in Prime is the highest price I'd pay to watch it.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's a fun game<br />I don't really play games but this one is cool every body should give it at least one try....
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am still learning the game, so far I am really enjoying it.  Looking forward to learning all the secrets.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Soundgarden is back in full force. If you are lucky enough to have seen them on their recent tour, you know they've still got it. This album blends some new sounds with a lot of their older work. Give it a couple listens and it really starts to sink some hooks into you.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|A fun display of the greatest American rock band ever - these guys are epic and timeless - the DVD is a fun tribute
0385523912|3.0|This book tells a lot of interesting stories. It certainly isn't the best writing ever, but it does weave a complex narrative of what goes on in the Hermit Kingdom. The author tries to use stories of people who lived in the same few places so we get an understanding of what a town might look like as opposed to completely separate stories. I read this while flying, but i can't say that I would have been able to stay interested if I wasn't bored and in the air.
B00013RC8O|5.0|I have loved many movies in my life and Vanishing Point is at the top of my list. As a lover of classic '60's/'70's muscle cars, this movie thrills from beginning to end. It's just one big Mopar commercial. I think the Challenger was one of the best looking cars of all time, so much so that I bought a 2013 Challenger R/T, white just like Kowalski's. I'll bet I've seen this movie 80-100 times.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this RPG is a very fun to play and has fantastic graphics. Even my 7 year old son can play this game he and is starting to enjoy RPG games as well. I would not expect this quality of a game to be free.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Wife and I were so excited to get this product. What a shame. Evidently we are &#34;old school&#34; and have slightly older Apple (1)  and Android (2) devices. The truth is this device does not work with any apple systems that cannot run IOS 6.0 or above. There are many that do not, including my wife's IPAD. Withings misleads you, stating in all product descriptions that it will work with the original IPAD.  Additionally, my android devices, a Samsung Galaxy (5 in) and Lenovo (7in) also could not support the software or upgrade to the versions required for the baby monitor. So, honestly, just a huge disappointment. I imagine if you are on the cutting edge of technology, you will have no issues, but if you are 1-4 years behind, you are better off looking for something else.
006202406X|1.0|I know that a lot of people have left well thought out, detailed reviews.  I could do that too, but I don't want to put that much effort into something that was so disappointing to me as a reader.  I found it tedious to finish and the end was GROSSLY dissatisfying.  Frankly, I got to the end and wanted to go back to everyone I had recommended it to and apologize or stop them from finishing it.  As someone who constantly rereads books over and over again, I will not be picking these up again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series is well-acted with an excellent story line.  It leaves you anticipating the next episode. Everyone will enjoy this drama.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The Walking Dead is worth paying for when I miss an episode! Now AMC requires a login and doesn't have my cable company listed....DVR Is a must every Sunday! But thanks Amazon!
B00F1RR3Y8|4.0|My little girl loves the games and add ons. She will save her money up from her chores just to have them when she gets her game time after school.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is addicting because you are trying to get all of the coins you can because you will be more focused on getting the coins and not  not trying to get cout!! [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I thought this was a cool game especially since the setting is underwater,  which brings a spooky feel.  I didn't mind paying the cost, it's not a quick game
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Gritty, tough, and real.  Actors were superb.  Action was intense.  All in all a great ride.Very highly recommended. See this one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addicting and annoying all at the same time. I'm glad it's finally available on the Kindle Fire! Fun for all ages.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This should be required reading for every American teenage girl who thinks life is hard for her.  Most inspiring story and transformation figure of our time.
B00632HWOG|1.0|can only get top mail to open up all the rest give me a box saying that the current email cannot be open up because of a connection<br />failure. I have did everything that is possible and nothing works tried to contact Yahoo by phone no luck.Did all the steps for a<br />Code failure of 45 and i got back a reply of  saying  it was  was my internet connection to check with my media company.<br />which i did and nothing wrong there so I have finally given up and going to gmail.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Oh please! It's Angry Birds - how can there be anything negative to ever say about this game. It is wonderful. The sounds are hilarious!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|This movie is so well done in all the departments that got it to the screen.Wonderful performances.Endlessly watchable.And great production values.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Fun game. I have both 1&amp;2, 2 is running much smother on my kindle fire than the first one does. The first one runs a bit glitchie at times. So far I am loving this one, it's a lot like Mario was on nintendo. Lots of fun and I recommend you try it out! Plus it's Free.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my niece. I paired it with a beauty and the beast gown. She loved the gift.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|What a cute movie. The kids love it and the minions are perfect! We can't wait for II to be available.
B005GU8ILW|5.0|Daughter loves this album. We bought it for christmas. It worked. out. really well for her. But she doesn't. use it as much as we expected.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|One of my new favorites. The music is soothing like a symphony but with an electric edge that is perfect for the movie. The movie was good, but the music is better.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|Wouldn't't recommend.  Too long to load and sometimes wouldn't load.  I will not be using the app though I like it for viewing like youtube
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! You HAVE to see it. I mean, some of the singing is questionable (mainly from Javert and Marius) but still.... Epoonine, Enjolras, the Thenardiers, Fantiane, and pretty much everyone else, AMAZING!!!!!!!!! So emotional and sad :..(  But wonderful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really loved this book.  The characters are well developed and many are likeable. You can even sympathize to an extent with the bad guys. They are evil but they care about each other, almost like a family. You can't help cheering on the good guys even though they have faults, they're human and believable heroes
B003HARV3Y|3.0|This movie is a good movie if you haven't read the books. But if you have, then it's a disgrace. How could Chris Columbus and Rick Riordan do this to us Percy Jackson fans? I am a fourteen-year-old devoted Percy Jackson lover and I was SO disappointed in this film. They were all so old! They'll all be forty by the last movie! And the Annabeth, she was nothing like the book! She's not a brunette! I always imagined the character looking like AnnaSophia Robb, not this actress. Logan Lerman was perfect, and so was Jake Abel, but everyone else? ALL WRONG. If you want to see a good movie just like it's book, watch Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. Not this. It's a great movie, but not Percy Jackson.
B006ZZQH4W|5.0|Dear Ms. Binchy,<br /><br />How I miss your words.  Your way of writing that captured the very essence of family life with all its imperfections and blessings has always touched my heart and I often find myself thinking back to your best works, remembering the characters whose lives touched mine.  This last unread book, so very small, has been sitting on my bedside table, tempting me since your death to pick it up and read it.  I've waited for a while, though, wanting to put off this last moment of savoring your wisdom for the first time.  Today was the perfect day to finally open its cover and jump in.  In this short story, you gave a wonderful look into the heart of a mother who must learn, after years of coddling, to give her children a dose of tough love.  The effect on her family - and her marriage - is dramatic and touching, as your writing always is.  I only wish it had been longer, for I read it in an hour and was so sad to put it down.  I will always miss your magical pen, Maeve, but I'm thankful for the way you blessed my life with it.<br /><br />A Grateful Reader
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Unique story with plenty of twists and turns in a creative environment and magic world. I am looking forward to the next installment.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Very impressed with this book. I have been working out for years and have gained and lost weight over and over again. Mike lays this stuff out how it actually works. I have personally been struggling with gaining muscle weight for a long time, and he has described a lot of methods which I remember have worked in the past for me, and I can now put them all together and give another go at this.<br />I'll let everyone know how the results are once I do it, but at the same time I still give it 5 stars because he goes above and beyond to really help you understand all of this. With lots of information on terminology, letting you know about which supplements are good and which are bogus, FAQs, etc., he really makes a good lesson with very little questions at the end of the book. Looking forward to starting his program.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|These were some of the best Who episodes. The (non-sexual) chemistry between Catherine Tate and David Tennant really rocks this thing.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|It was boring and the premise is played out.The first Hangover remains the only good one. &#34;Hangover 3&#34; is not worth 4 dollars.
B0074Q41LW|4.0|Good book for beginner or advanced.  Many non sleight of hand card tricks, as well as card sleight of hand for more advanced magicians.  Was easy to read and go through.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of the most wonderful Christmas films ever written, and made into a movie.  Children and adults of all ages love it.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|At the beginning of my read, I didn't have very high hopes. I had seen mixed reviews and have to admit I agreed with some of the lower ratings at first. About a third of the way through that changed and I ended up loving this story. So if you're having a hard time, keep at it...things get better.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed's story is not pretty. She did some pretty terrible things. Some say that makes her selfish and spoiled. I think it's great that she admits these things, not only to the reader but also to the person she hurt the most. This is a story of self discovery and self acceptance. Yes, she was selfish when she committed her transgressions. Yes, she was naïve when she set off on her hike. But, as much as she kept saying she was going to quit, she never did. She stuck it out. Maybe she was trying to avoid real life, but I don't think the reasons matter. The end result is that she found what she was looking for...what she didn't even know she needed. There are many lessons to be learned through her journey.<br /><br />I'd also like to quickly address the critics that complain Strayed didn't hike the whole trail. What difference does that make? At no point in the book or in the synopsis does she claim she ever had that as her plan. The woman hiked, mostly alone, for months. That is an accomplishment and shouldn't be diminished because the reader expects a different result.<br /><br />All in all, I found this book to be an inspiration. No matter what is going on in your life, you can overcome.<br /><br />**A note for Kindle readers about the Oprah edition:  I found the marked passages to be pretty unobtrusive. Oprah's notes aren't super profound or essential to your own understanding of the story.  It is my suggestion to read the book through yourself and check out her notes after.  It's easy enough to jump to her notes and back to your reading, but it does take you out of the flow of the story and it's not necessary.
B00BAXFAJC|2.0|I found this book to be very disappointing. The writing was stiff and the characters were two-dimensional. The author routinely went to great lengths describing what each character wore, and yet there was no real feeling for what the characters were like. Certainly not worthy of the Booker. I've read most of the Booker winners, and this is one of the weakest ever. I liked Jim Crace's Harvest much better.<br /><br />The last 200 pages were almost unbearable. It appeared to be padded to make it longer...most of the last 100 pages were half a page long or less. Why? The supposed complexity of this book is laughable. It is not a difficult or challenging book, yet it is pitched as that. It's actually a two-dimensional, contrived story. Not complex, no depth. The idea that each chapter is one half the length of the previous chapter? No real point that I could see. The signs of the zodiac? Again, I don't see much connection to the story. Gimmicky.<br /><br />I was embarrassed by the treatment of the lone token Maori, as well as the token stereotyped Chinese characters...two of them, usually referred to as Chinks in the story.<br /><br />And one more thing...Just because a writer uses big words (I like words), writes 800+ pages (I enjoy a good long read), and supposedly writes in a 'Dickensian' style (not to me, but many have mentioned this), does not guarantee good writing! Most critics seem to have been blinded. There's more to it than that!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love The Piano Guys and have followed them since it was just Jon Schmidt with Steve Sharp Nelson as a tagalong. This new Christmas album did not disappoint.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book said everything I profess to believe, but said it in a way that made me more of a Believer that our Thoughts are Powerful. So, be Intentional with what you Think. The Experiments are Fun and Easy. Expect Abundance!
B008JFUNHI|5.0|I took my daughter to this movie on the second day it was in the theater. We have both read the book, and we both enjoyed the movie more. I can't think of a single way they could have improved it. Asa Butterfield was amazing as Ender and deserves to win something for his performance.
B009O2XY12|5.0|The app and game are fun. I have no further comments or feedback for things to be changed.. thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game. I play it on my computer, my Iphone and on my Kindle Fire.... Once you stat playing this game it's hard to stop
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Outstanding book!  It has the usual intriguing Stephen King writing combined with the wonders of AA and how it helps individuals handle their alcoholism and regain a  productive place in society.  It is also a follow up to The Shining which is one of my favorite books of all time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for my favorite addiction to come to kindle. Plays great, graphics are wonderful. Connection sometimes not so great. Love it
B000R2SXJ6|5.0|This is going to be a Christmas gift for my dad (He's a huge Hendrix fan) He lost it while in Germany and I thought this would be great for him.
B006TZGVZS|5.0|EXCELLENT READ, OMG!  this man was so brave and he really taught me something in his dying. I love Moarrie and didn't even know him. thanks so much for those classes Mitch Albom !
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an imagination this author has! All I can say is WOW! Can't wait to read what comes next in this series. Great job, author! And I'm not even a sci-fi kind of gal! :)
B004J8HX5E|5.0|This is a great resource when starting a design project.  Just think of what kind of emotional reaction you want to the piece, look it up, and PRESTO!  Instant color resourcing.  This is a really good tool to have in the design box.  Attractively put together too.  My child enjoyed looking through it as much as I did.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE the Extended Edition I have watched it 2 or 3 times already most likely watch it a few more times
B005NPCUC8|5.0|one of my favorite examples of an album of music designed to be heard in one sitting.  Close your eyes and this album will take you on an amazing journey. The balance of voice and instrument effects is rarely matched.  I think of this as a rock symphony.
B00338QENI|5.0|I've never been very fond of non-fiction novels, but this one caught my attention and didn't let me down. The struggle of the family trying to understand what happened was heart-wrenching. I would definitely recommend this page-turner to anyone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A true Grisham page turner!!  Well developed plot with numerous twists and turns.  Grisham has out done himself yet again. Loved the new area of law and history all intertwined into one compelling story.
1401312853|3.0|This was a quick read, bought on a whim at the airport.  The pace was nice, with the storyline jumping around between time and place and characters in an interesting way.  The book is based on the concept of time, which interests me, and the idea of time embodied in a person was an engaging approach.  However, I have to say that I enjoyed Albom's other works a little more than this one.  My main criticisms of this novel: (1) this one was a bit heavy-handed with morality and (2) I would've like the characters to be more developed; as I read I was continually waiting to be let in so I cared more about them.  Fine for an airplane ride, though!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|As good a mystery novel as you are likely to come across in any language.  Strong characters and top-flight writing make this a winner.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|I was trying to use this on my Kindle fire. It did not work for me. I guess this app in  not compatible with kindle.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Good game to just relax and play. I enjoy time-management games they put me to ease. The main character is cute to watch as she runs around to get the customer's orders.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a nice game that I think everyone can enjoy.<br />you don't have to pay money to<br /><br />have fun its a quick addictive game.
B000MQCSBQ|1.0|It wouldn't play on my blue ray, DVD player, or computer.  Wasn't to happy with this purchase. Thank you so much.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|poor low budget, glad i didnt go to the theather. poor acting, really no story to the outcome. I guess will smith is just trying to promote his son.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Hope the movie lives up to the book. This book should be required reading for all high schoolers. The lessons about human nature and military strategy are life changing. This book is still in my top 5 even after 10 years.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was amazing and great I hope you enjoy the book  I would so buy a hundred copies of this book
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I think this app is probably the closest app on kindle fire to you tube. But I don't like the adds popping up about updating the app, and some other random stuff. And I think you should make it EASY to make an account. But other wise&hellip;ok.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|Just wasn't what I wanted, I guess.  I've not yet tried another 'note' app - but perhaps I will sometime in the future.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I love it!  Who doesn't?  Allegory?  Symbolism?  Mirrored reality?  Who cares!  Keep the dead alive!  Except, I wish they'd expand to 26 episodes per &#34;season&#34;!
1476727651|4.0|Because I haven't read it yet.  But, being by Stephen King I know that I'll really like it. What ever.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Addicted.  I hope you are too!  Yes, you can come in to the fold at Season 2 and not be too lost, but, well worth it to get Season 1 and see how it all began...
0767836324|5.0|I remember this one from when I was a kid.  Just a great, wholesome movie, unlike most of the crap that's coming out today.
B00C061I3K|3.0|the music is less than i had hoped. everything else about deliver etc was good though. just the music itself is underwhelming.
B007XNAPNY|5.0|There are few bands I enjoy Live, but Duran Duran is Awesome!!!  This show is Exciting and the music is a little bit of New mixed with a Lot od their older stuff. The sound and video quality are Great.  Even if you aren't a Duran Duran Fan you might want to check them out here--give them a chance--they are all grown up now  lol
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Favorite movie of all time.  Never looks dated. This is the best most awesome movie I've ever watched. Excited to show my kids.
B007XNAQ6A|4.0|Really Good album--the Live Show was one of the best I have Ever heard from Any Band and it sounds just as Great on CD.  Even if not a Fan, check it out--you just might get a Surprise!!  Fabulous Sound Quality.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Coll game just don't like the battery system other than that its the best hunting game out right now. I would give it five stars but the battery kills me
B00006LI4S|5.0|Very Good concert video--I don't know that Gilmour has Ever done a &#34;Not Good Show&#34;  He is in Excellent form here and even talks with the audience a bit!! Some nice behind the scenes moments. Wish there were more.
B001974DG0|5.0|A client of mine told me this was a \\"must read\\" and she was right.  Dean Koontz is an excellent author.  This story is an incredible testament of the power of love, while not being sappy.  It has a great element of suspense that will keep you turning the pages.  I wish the story didn't have to end!
B00DPH7Q0W|5.0|This is the BEST and Most Interesting video EVER!!! Dark Side of the Moon is, of course,  one of the Best Albums Ever done by Any Band and now we get to hear how it was made. Lots of Commentary and Fun Facts. You Know this HAS to be Great and it Definitely doesn't disappoint.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|Look, I'm not a monster.<br /><br />Whenever those little yellow minions came on the screen, I laughed my heart out. They are easily the funniest characters in any children's film, like, EVER. Their antics never, ever fail to amuse, and I see a bright, banana-filled future for them. Gut-bursting moments include one minion's ill-fated attempt at making jam, and Gru's immature fire brigade (&#34;BEE-DO, BEE-DO!&#34;).<br /><br />So it's a pity then, that the majority of the film is given to Gru's (Steve Carell) stale and rather bland relationship with his girls - Agnes, Whatever, and Blah Blah, or something, some rather dull spy work, and a very unthreatening and uninteresting villain's plot. Let's talk a bit about the villain. In a movie where pretty much ALL your characters are villains, or people operating deep in the shades of grey...you really need a strong antagonist. Despicable Me had that strong antagonist in Vector - a hilarious, nerdy, comically ineffective but dastardly bad guy. Despicable Me TWO has the rather unthreatening and unfunny Eduardo.<br /><br />Really Dreamworks? It thought you learned your lesson. The only reason we forked out close to a billion dollars to see DESPICABLE ME 2 was for minions - those little yellow bundles of instant comedy.<br /><br />When you see past the hilarity of stylized slapstick, you find a film that is clich&eacute;d, rather bland, and trying way too hard. A sizable disappointment, which is not to say unfunny. I tremendously enjoyed watching Despicable Me 2, and was heaving with laughter half the time. It just could have been so much better.  My rating? 6/10 - For the fan.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is a very thorough, accurate, and very absorbing history of our nuclear weapon history.  It is written in a New Yorker style, with enough detail to satisfy any historical reader.  My own history of this period equates with what I found in this study.  What astonishes me is how much I suspected, but didn't know about the subject.  What may shock most readers is how close we have come for none of us to have survived this period.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is such a cool game. It's so clever how they made all of the scenes at a railway line. So in that case I think it should be rated as 9/10. I also like the way they update it so for like each season they'd update it or for each thing like Halloween or Christmas they'd update it.<br /><br />AWSOME GAME!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is perfect when you're waiting for an appointment or need to while away 15 minutes.  It's a good thing they limit you to five lives at a time ;otherwise, I could see this app taking significant chunks out of my life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an opportunity of a lifetime, my friends. This game is amazing. The question is how much do you like it. If you do then write a review about this amazing game. But do hurry because it won't be on the halloween series for long. The Halloween series. I can't seem to get a prize because I can't get many pumpkins to get any prizes.<br /><br />  Your sincerely Eva Jackson:)
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Awesome game! I have played this game in both apple and android and you can't stop playing it.  I gave four stars because once you get to level 2 or 3, the zombies are much faster and stronger but you don't get much of an upgrade.
1781162646|5.0|A very emotional and short read. This is one of the first SK books I've read and what a way to start. If you're interested in buying this book, buy it. It will be a 200+ page experience of tears, and the ending is my favorite part. The only criticism i have (since this is a whodunit) is that the killer was too obvious to figure out. The book itself is on how getting dumped is not so bad in the big scope of things.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|It was much better than I thought it was going to be.  I think it that was because of the strong acting ability of Charlie Hunnam who plays Jax in Sons of Anarchy.  Special effects are great.  I would recommend seeing this.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is very fun. Fun for kids and adults. No money necessary. Buy this game!!!!! You most definitely will not regret it you will love it. About it and have lots of fun
B000SEKNUK|5.0|Very well written with truly great advice and demonstrations of how to bring creativity and learning into your life in practical and dynamic ways.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|One of the best.  Hard to get gems is only part I don't like.  Really good.  One of my all time favorites.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Enjoyed, the trilogy, couldn't put it down. Only disappointing part was that the storyline was quite similar to the first.
B00CO52NLI|3.0|It's okay... there are some bad things though<br />1. You have to pay if you want to take care of dogs, cats, reptiles, birds or horses(separately). It's 10 bucks all together.<br />2.this guy uses the word &quot;keen&quot; way too much. &quot; my wife is really keen on getting a pet&quot; &quot;she is a really keen hairdresser&quot; etc<br />3. He REALLY needs to check his spelling and grammar.<br />4. The sentences don't make sense. EX: &quot;my family have been pestering me.&quot;  &quot;I can see you really very excited.&quot;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited! I can finally play on my kindle fire hd.... I am so addicted! Love it! I can't wait for more addicting games!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Amazing game all around. Just wish you could earn more coins when you level up. But it's still a great game. Love it. I'm actually addicted.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|is it worth the money because my friend got it and said it was stupid and I want to know if she is telling the truth or not but should I really pay $3.91 for it just a question
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Like a zillion other people, I was impressed by Aslan's TV appearance and was appalled by the Fox News interviewer. And as a student of theology, I was interested in the content so I immediately bought it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it reads like term paper. And though it is well documented, it is still theoretical, which is fine but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I wasted my money. I blame that on Fox News and myself--and not Aslan who still seems like a nice man, but kind of boring.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|fun simple game for anyone to play,  nice to play in between other games.battles are a little tricky if you don't know what their strengths are.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Barf. There was too much Steven Spielberg and not enough Abraham Lincoln. This has to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am addicted and play when I can. Completely love riding Fluffly the unicorn and seeing the Minions be scared when in mega Mminion mode.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Flimsy novel.  If it had been beautifully written I would have happily forgiven the lack of substance.  But it was written prosaically, and left me with a Ho-hum feeling.  It's not that I regret reading it, but I certainly would not recommend it to anyone else. There are other things that are more engaging and engrossing and worth the time it takes to read a book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Whoo, I got the chills, and basically died on the 3rd note... not because of the game of course, the game is great, and had me scared to death. I guess I'm just pretty bad at it, but don't take my word, try it for yourself!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I loved this show.  Friends told me to watch and I was not disappointed. I really enjoy period drama and I learned a lot from this.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Very clear and crisp especially the HD! I have no trouble with the streaming it was a smooth.. I'm glad I got Prime!
0743201140|3.0|The book provides a special code to enable online access to site where you are directed to take a test.  The test asks you various questions about how passionate you are about certain situations, etc.  Once you have completed the test, a report is generated which identifies the strength areas where you excel and defines those strengths.  The strengths allude to which careers might be right for you.  You can print out and customize the report.<br /><br />Due to no fault of the authors, this test has no value to someone over 35 years old. Identifying your strengths is the key prerequisite to planning your entire career.  If your 50, it would be very difficult to start over.  I work for a very large American Corporation that purchased this book for all of its employees.  Surprisingly, a significant number of my co-workers discovered they were not playing to their strengths.  For them, it revealed why they were so unhappy.  For me, it revealed why many of my colleagues have so many performance problems even though they are great people.  Unfortunately, at 40, 50 and up to 60 years old, they cannot change careers because they have families that their six-figure salaries now.  Honestly, I think would have been much happier not knowing that most of us are not so unhappy because we chose professions that played to our strengths.<br /><br />Parents!  For you, this book is 5 stars.  Buy this book for your children between the ages of 15 and 28.  This will probably save their life.  However, do not take it for yourself.  Just make a really long list of things you like to do and pick one that aligns with your current skills and can turn into more money.
B00881VLCE|4.0|this is a great game! if the pieces were easier to place it would be a 5 star game! the colors on the puzzles are great. definitely get this game if u want a way to relax.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This movie was really well made.  Although I'm not normally fond of zombie films, this one was a top of the line film with a solid scenario, and had solid acting from Brad Pitt and all the supporting cast.  It's definitely an 'edge of your seat' experience from almost the beginning and has incredilbe special effects that truly bring you into the experience, but it also has great humanity in it for your heart and that's its real strength.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It was an enjoyable conclusion to the series.  It was a lot to wrap up during the final book in the series.
0812983459|5.0|I'm buying this book just to put it in the littlefreelibrary.com at the end of my block. Such a good story, beautifully told. Sad, but true, and life-affirming.
B00FMFEA68|1.0|I'm a huge Morrissey/Smith's fan and was looking forward to reading this book. But what a disappointment. The book is too long and too tedious. The first third is devoted to Mozza's growing up in Manchester, which is fair enough, and enables the reader to understand more about his later life, where his lyrics come from etc. But this section is overly long - at one point, he writes about the TV shows he liked as a child, for 10 pages. Way too much detail! Then the Smiths period - which is too short, and only about 10% of the book is devoted to this. There are few insights, a lack of personal detail - for example, there is nothing about Andy Rourke's habit, which surely must've had a big impact on the band. There's hardly anything about the relationship between Morrissey and Marr, or how they made music together. Really disappointing. Then the next massive chunk is devoted to the Joyce court case - which goes on and on and on. Way, way too long. And then for the rest of the book Morrissey gives us a travelogue of being on the road for several months - again too long, not overtly interesting. So, generally, an overlong book with not enough personal details. And not one photo of the Smiths. If you're a fan, well, you're duty-bound to read this book, but don't expect much...
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is an excellent novel by John Green. It is a novel about love, adventure, and death. When Hazel the main character, and a cancer patient, meets a boy named Augustus at a support group he changes her from a girl that stays at home to a girl that goes out and has adventures. This book is all about being free no matter what you face. Hazel and Augustus go to Amsterdam together to find the ending of a book, and also find true love. I loved this novel.
B00AW57L96|1.0|Tediious, middle-class, suburban drivel. I didn't care about any of the characters or their petty concerns and found them all unbearable. As to the big secret - well, yes, it was a dark act for one of the characters, but really, I just didn't care. Trashy airport novels are better than this.
B008P9M614|5.0|Exactly what i was looking for, all of the episodes from all seasons.  Every disc plays perfectly and i think the packaging is simple and attractive.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Before Mike and Sully were legends at Monsters, Inc. they went to MU where it's okay to be OK. Fans of the monsters will enjoy seeing their milestones and experiences at school. It's an environment that most people can relate to, and there is wide-eyed Mike in braces and then his retainer. Mike and Sully are so human! You gotta love them!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting.  Mind boggling, this would be an excellent game to offer those of senior age to keep their mind fresh, although at times ot can be a challenge it keeps your attention
1465414444|5.0|I love this book.  I can just pick it up when I'm watching TV with my boys (which typically isn't very enjoyable) and browse through it, pick out things of interest in the 10 year old game of World of Warcraft!  Five Stars for sure!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Supervillains take over the world? Awesome. Brandon Sanderson? Awesome. The world building is great as always without going into quite as much depth as he usually does I'm his adult novels.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|Meh.....<br />Lackluster performance on the part of the writers. And what was with all the heavy guns?! That was stupid! Freeman makes a slightly long cameo appearance, just for the billboard, I guess. John was excellently cast, though. Two thumbs up on that. The love story with the Russian was as predictable as beans causing gas! Was glad to NOT see any passionate love-making between Willis and the chick. Trans-generational relationships are just kind of, well, a stretch. Did like the scene when Bruce stepped out of the moving partol car and opened fire on the bad guy (who turns out to be a good guy - Ooops! Spoiler!)<br />The teenagers liked the movie, but I was disappointed.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Wow. What an awesome movie. It reinforces what a serious job being a dad is and how to take that giant step from being a father to being the father God wants you to be. It doesn't avoid the tough situations, like a dad who walked away from being a father and is now trying to make it right. Great movie.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great family flick!<br />We popped some corn, poured some pop, and enjoyed this with the whole family!<br />Especially loved the land whales!
B0088WK27S|5.0|It can be a tad slow at times, but the fact that this heart-wrenching story is based on a true story is amazing.
1439190275|5.0|Easy read with tons of knowledge to get you back on track and to eat a healthier way...although some of this is all merely opinon as there are millions of *Diet* books...I like to look at it as a Live-It lifestyle and incorporate much of this information written in the book for the best plan custom made for me. It helped me get off the refined sugars and eating lower glycmeic index carbs and the result was been really good. Much more energy and less junk food cravings. Valuable tools for a better lifestyle. Enjoy!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Nope not really digging this movie... about half way through realize you've been duped into something completely unforseen with no way of possibly coming to that conclusion on your own
B008JFUORW|5.0|All the Hangover movies are fantastic. They are funny as hell, capitvating and well directed, produced and purely delightful. Hope they make the Hangover 4. After the first one, it is easy to bond with all the characters for the second and third one. I love when film makers make a second third fourth or more using the exact same actors each time to make it more culpable...this one was right up there with the first and second one...Enjoy!
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Love this movie!  Great for the kids and a good lesson about following your dreams and being determined and following through!
B00D82BNLC|4.0|I'll admit that when I cracked the first page and found the story was in first person, I was a little bit scared. I haven't had the best luck with that particular writing style. But Carolyn Bennett surprised me with her ability to pull it off! It's been a long time since I read a quality ghost story with a narrative that kept me on the edge of my seat with all the lights on!<br /><br />The main character Leigh is dealing with personal tragedy and struggling to be a single mom when she is given the chance to join a paranormal investigation team. Seeing this as a chance to make a change, she goes with the team to investigate an abandoned hospital. Let's just start with there's possibly nothing creepier than abandoned hospitals (except maybe old dolls). Following Leigh through this investigation, seeing everything from her point of view made the scare factor that much more intense.<br /><br />But I was also pleased to find that this wasn't just a story meant to keep me up at night. There is a distinctly human element to the struggles Leigh faces and the friendships she makes. This is a great read, just be ready to be creeped out.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good action movie, many action sequences and pretty good acting.  Spoiler alert:  the ending of this movie was very soft for all the action that the first hour brought.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Director paint a beautiful portrait of a hopeless romantic. Creative style of directing and great use of complimentary colours to bring out the scenes
B008JFUNHI|2.0|I am a huge fan of Enders Game. I firsst read it when I was in middle school and immedatley loved it. I have read all of his books. I always wanted a Movie of this book to come out. Marvel even made a graphic novel and did not leave too much out. Though this movie is so wrong. they destroyed every good thing they could. they made up there own plots . Battle school was 20min of the whole movie. I wish atleast the did it in two diffrent movies like Tolken is doing with his book of the hobbit. Battle school and command school.
B00ENYCQX8|3.0|I was happy to be able to read my kindle books with this, but the bookmarking is clunky and I wish you were able to look up words like you can with the kindle reader. The formatting is not always accurate with line breaks in the books, I've noticed. But I can read, and that is the point! ;)
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Many twist and turns. This movie was very good well know actors good plot.  Special effects were realistic and car scenes were good
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to crushing it's a great game to play to pass the time, some of the levels require more thought process than others but I love the game
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Took me a little time to get started. But that was just me being to much in the here and now. The S. King caught me and I was totally into it.
B001EC2IT4|5.0|A classic ghost story. Funny, cute, and with characters that pop. One of the better movies for Halloween, if you want to avoid blood and gore.
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|It's a great book if its purpose is to give a middle school English course several classes worth of talking points regarding utopias and dystopias.  Otherwise, I was a little disappointed.  There were several aspects of the Utopian society that warranted some further explanation.  Additionally, there was a certain &#34;magic&#34; inherent in the people or the society that never received any more attention than that which was convenient for the plot line.  I read this and two others in the series so I could join a book club with my students who were reading the final book of the quartet (of which The Giver is the first).  I was surprised at just how many potentially pivotal questions were left unanswered and how many seemingly fascinating aspects of the world Lowry constructed were left wholly unexplored.  That said, I would not say that this book is without merit.  Three stars, for me, indicates a teen fiction that has a continuous flow, some page-turning suspense, doesn't patronize young readers, and challenges them to think beyond their current surroundings without relying entirely on the fantastic.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the interconnection of the lives of Ms. Moriarty's characters and simply couldn't put down this well written novel.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was very much a let down from what had seemed like a talented author. The end might have been acceptable if she had done a better job of writing it. What a waste.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i absolutely love candy crush, but when i got a kindle i realised amazon didn't have it so when my aunt told us we were all really excited:) 5 stars!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is even more fun then bejeweled. I love the way it changes with each level. The fact that you have only so many tries before you have to either stop and wait for the clock to restartmakes you step away and relax so you don't get burned out on the game. If you want you can buy more tries.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|For the most part this game is fun! My 2 year old even enjoys playing it! I love that you get unlimited lives.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Does not work on my Kindle Fire HD, Some of the games and such don't work on the Kindle Fire HD. Need to let people know when there will be a issue or to choose another option that works better.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|It's one of his best albums if not the best...Joe is really bringing it , every song is a must listen too.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved it!  This book in the &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; series is probobly my favorite since the original.  A must read for fantasy genre lovers.

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Never know what's going to happen from episode to episode.Good plot and the writers keep the story lines from getting tired.Used to sit-coms were all the rage and next those stinking reality shows but the Walking Dead is a breath of fresh air!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|my grandkids and husband enjoy this game<br />They always enjoy reaching the next level<br />Keeps them quiet and busy having fun
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Been a Star Trek fan since the first episode aired in 1967.The only draw back about this movie is ripping off the last scene and switching roles.But besides that the picture and sound is top notch!
B005IGVZX2|4.0|Bad as me is one of the best work from Tom Waits, by my opinion. I bought vinyl, and sound is not as good as I expected but it is not bad, so 5 stars for the music and 3 stars for vinyl, therefor my grade is 4.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|you must get this game right now and I mean it.  NOW GET IT AND I MEAN IT SO GET IT NOW
B001FBJUKE|5.0|Amazing energy on this record, it is not surprise the effect it had when it came out. Attitude Sex pistols had is hard to find these days. I bought vinyl 2008 issue, and I can recommend it, the sound is very good.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I am always in search for a good book that will challenge the way people view themselves. This book does just that. You will smile as the Main character is thrust into every adventure and situation given. You will smile again, for the beautiful message this book delivers. Wonderful all the way around.
1476727651|4.0|When we first met Danny Torrance in [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]], he was a little boy about to embark on a horrifying, demon-fueled nightmare at the Overlook Hotel. When we meet him again in [[ASIN:1476727651 Doctor Sleep]], he's become an alcoholic (just like good ol' Dad) in an effort to erase those demons he first confronted 36 years earlier -- and to muffle his shining, which he can never truly escape. After reaching \\"the bottom,\\" Dan knows he needs to change his life, and he ends up in the small town of Frazier, New Hampshire, working at a hospice where he's known as Doctor Sleep. He forges a mysterious connection with a little girl named Abra, who shines like he does, but much more brightly. Meanwhile, a band of nomads who call themselves the True Knot are roaming the country, searching for their version of food: the steam released by children who have the shining. They know about Abra, and they're closing in...<br /><br />I first read [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]] when I was in high school, and in all the years since (I refuse to say exactly how many!) I have never read anything that scared me as much as that book did. Needless to say, my expectations for this sequel were extremely high. And honestly, I'm not quite sure that [[ASIN:1476727651 Doctor Sleep]] met them. If this were any other author writing about any other character, I think I'd probably rate this book a solid three stars. As it is, I have such a soft spot for Stephen King and Danny Torrance that I just can't bring myself to give a three-star rating.<br /><br />First, the good -- and there is so much good. The characterizations in this book are vivid, as King's characters always are, and the writing is fantastic, as King's writing always is. King does an excellent job of filling in Dan's history in the years immediately following the events at the Overlook (although I wanted more about his teenage years, as well as more about his relationships with Wendy and Dick Hallorann). He writes aboutalcoholism sensitively and honestly. The book is well-paced, compulsively readable, and contains a couple of emotional moments near the end that actually gave me chills. The book as a whole feels redemptive, which I liked very much.<br /><br />There were a couple of things about the book, however, that I found less successful, and they centered on the villains -- the True Knot. I didn't really find them very scary; they were actually a bit cartoonish, with equally silly names. And I wanted to know much more about them -- about their origins, in particular. I think if their history was more fleshed out, they would have felt much scarier and less like Scooby Doo villains. Also, as I mentioned above, I wanted Wendy to be more present; that poor woman deserved to have more of her story told, too.<br /><br />In my opinion (and that of many others, I believe), [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]] is Stephen King's masterpiece. It would be nearly impossible to match that book (something King himself acknowledges in the Afterword), and I don't think [[ASIN:1476727651 Doctor Sleep]] will even come close. That said, it definitely does justice to the story of the Torrance Family, and I enjoyed every word of it.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|i love anne rice was very happy when this series was brought to movie... love absolutely love uber love lastat
B000QCSA54|5.0|Read this book and know your next step today. It is a quick read that really does help you know how to become the best in the world.
B000005HLV|5.0|the best thing mayhem ever produced, this album was actually delayed for 4 years because the vocalist committed suicide and the bassist was in jail for murdering the guitarist, the lyrics are at their best and the cover art is amazing. any metal fan should own this
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This game is so great for new gamers and more relaxed gaming atmospheres. You can also take it camping and on trips. There is no reason not to own this game.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Dexter Rocks!  Awesome Series!  Its still a good deal buying the series or each episode.  Nice option vs the DVD.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Margaret Atwood is wonderful. I wish there was a 4th book of the MaddAddam. I found it difficult at first because the story came from a different angle than the first two but eventually I was devouring her every word.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had heard so much about this game and when I was able to download it to my kindle,I played constantly.  This was is really fun and entertaining.I would definitely recommend it to others. It's full of fun and can get quite challenging.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Of course it's addictive. That's why it's a must have. Great job launching a Kindle compatible version. I had already killed one phone from over heating in Candy Land frenzies!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This could have been an interesting game,The Oregon Trail:American Settlers if would have worked properly.  It worked well in the beginning but as you progress into the game, it no longer worked properly.  Yet it's a game I would recommend to others.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|This was a good read. Very interesting subject and time in history. Might surprise those who were not fans of Eat, Pray, Love.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I chose little Big City because I like to build and be entertained while playing this game.  I thought it was a pretty neat games, especially when you can interact with the neighbours in the game.  I would definitely recommend this game Little Big City (kindle edition) to friends and family members.  This g a me is really entertaining.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|This is a money grabber. Not bad for gameplay but this game is greedy for money.  If it had online play it would rock.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers if the best game ever it's better than temple run and everything it's fun and I just love it!
0060229357|5.0|I bought this for my collection of books to read to my grandchildren.  It was recommended by someone who had read it as a child and the storyline seemed delightful.  It absolutely was.  It's great for younger children or those whose attention spans are not quite &#34;there&#34; yet.  It is engaging, imaginative, and wholesome.  It has a wonderful and sweet ending.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes to read to children and have their attention.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush Saga. So much fun to play. I play on facebook also thank you for putting on kindle.
B0081336FO|5.0|Amazing! I can't get enough of the show I wish there were more episodes! If you like thrill mystery and a little bit of four this is the show to watch. The suspense kills me for the next show love it love it love it!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive but it helps too not pay money to keep getting up grades lol causes you to take breaks
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I cannot get over how good this show is! There are 20+ episodes per season and it just doesn't get old!! I love it!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought this book was good, it kept my attention and I never guessed the secret. I thought I knew what the secret was but I was wrong. I would recommend this book to other women to read.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Deeply imaginative, and engaging in places, slow beginning, Portuguese a bit confusing, worth reading but it's no Enders game. The original is stellar.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|What an exquisitely written novel.  A wonderfully rich tale that encompasses 'all things'.  Brilliantly crafted amd told, this book is a delight to the senses and in my humble opinion, a masterpiece.  Bravo Eliizabeth Gilbert!!!  I loved it so much that I immediately started at the beginning once I had finished... Never have done that before!
B00A7R0JPM|3.0|Bit average.  Couldn't quite get into it.  The idea seemed ok, but the story I thought lacked depth and just didn't quite do it.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|For this price, how could I pass up this movie on Blu Ray.  It is such a great show, and nice to watch on the new TV with the Blu-ray
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I think this is one of the funniest free apps yet, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people would agree with me. You should also get the card duel app too if you like stuff like that. So basically I'm just saying play this game! O3O
1449415881|5.0|Bought this for my Sister at Christmas, she wants Dilbert every year, she really enjoys the day to day calendar.

B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I can turn my classic rock music into a remix of the original version I love it the party has begun
B008JFUNNM|4.0|About four years ago an American freight ship was hijacked off the coast of Somalia, and pirates attempted to extort a ridiculous ransom. Ultimately the US government directed a rescue mission involving Navy seals, recovered the ship, and killed the pirates.<br /><br />Except that is not exactly what happened, and we now have a gripping movie telling the true story of what happened to Captain Phillips.<br /><br />Tom Hanks excels as the Captain, dealing with these sometimes hysterical, often irrational pirates who make unrealistic demands for money, and persist in their demands to the point of folly, with the only weapons at his disposal, his wits.<br /><br />If any pirate should dare to watch this movie, they will learn a very cautionary tale about messing with American ships in International waters, and more importantly messing with the military might of the American government.<br /><br />If you're like me you may be surprised at the level and style of defense of the freighter given the prevalence of piracy incidents around Somalia, that enabled a large freighter ship to be taken over by only four pirates, and unusual measures the ship took. How four pirates were able to actually to get this ship is a wonder to behold.<br /><br />There is no Captain Jack Sparrow, no peg legs, no pieces of eight, or bottles of rum in this movie. What we have instead is the gritty reality of piracy, and pirates, and the sense that human life has no value to them.<br /><br />What I like about Captain Phillips the character is that he is in his element, and in control of his ship. The pirates are never able to get control, because the crew is dispersed and hidden, and without arms yet able to resourcefully counter the pirates attempts.  Tom Hanks gives another nomination worthy performance.<br /><br />Captain Phillips is not so much a struggle between pirates and sailors but between entirely different ways of life, and systems. When Captain Phillips offer them the $30,000 in the ships safe, one wonders why they did not take that, and call it a good days work. But no, one can see how their choices pave the way to tragedy, greed being the fatal propeller.<br /><br />I found this movie to be much better than I anticipated, and I loved the acting of the pirate Muse, the gaunt leader of the pirates, whose very gauntness appears menacing.<br /><br />One strange response I had to the movie was that about two third of the way through the movie when the action moves to a lifeboat, I began to feel queasy, not understanding why. I realized I was getting from watching all the heaving motion on a forty foot screen, filmed with somewhat jerky hand held cameras.<br /><br />I put my hands over my eyes for several minutes, stealing the occasional peek when I could, until the feeling passed. I imagine you will not experience the same problem watching on a large screen tv as in a theater, but if you decided to watch this while still in release, bring some dramamine or cover your eyes if necessary.<br /><br />So, my takeaway from this movie is that it's not about the motion of the ocean or the size of the ship, it's about the size of the navy you have supporting you, and it's about your own personal resourcefulness in dealing with danger. An interesting fact is that the leader of the pirates asked to be tried as a juvenile, claiming he was 15 or 16 at the time.  He later admitted to being 18.<br /><br />I understand that the shipping company's was sued by some members of the crew claiming the company and Phillips recklessly and knowingly ignored piracy reports, and allowed the ship to sail in pirate infested waters.<br /><br />I think you will enjoy, as it is quite gripping. If you are prone to seasickness, you might prefer to wait for the dvd.s safe, one wonders why they did not take that, and call it a good days work.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's ok though I have noticed some thing's that could be fixed i have been asking for tickets to a new world and it reads on the computer but not on my kindle. But besides that everything is ok.
0375836675|2.0|I really enjoyed the way this book started out. Kind of a like a long haiku of clipped sentences. A mystery unfolds with playing cards sending the main character to different addresses. I'm not quite sure why. The ending is horribly disappointing and totally unbelievable. The best part is his relationship with with dog known as The Doorman.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|the game is very exciting and addicting, the only problem is buying the gems you need, but it is still fun and exciting!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|The game is fun and enjoyable.but after I close down andnplay another app and I come back it closes down and wont work right it is very irritating
B00BRUPICM|5.0|This is a great book.  It has two fantastic plot twists, which both turn you on your head.  Our protagonist Camille is a 4'11&#34; detective who has to solve a kidnapping.  His involvement in the case is complicated by the fact that his wife and child had been murdered in a kidnapping. It's hard to describe much of the plot because of the plot twists.  Just buckle up and enjoy the ride!
B00881VLCE|1.0|C<br />Don't understand how to play this, yet to play one, but then I'm not all that smart, need to spend some time with it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a race car fan, dog lover and proud father of a wonderful daughter I could not put this one down! About half way through I called the guy that recommended the book to ask if it had a happy ending. He just said, &#34;Keep reading&#34;. Glad I did.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game, just wish could make the blocks larger, but that's my personnel feeling as i have trouble with my eyes.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|A long awaited, fourth album by my favorite group.  No disappointments here.  A great album, through and through.  They delivered on my expectations.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|How can anyone miss with Google, I like to check different things, so I find this super handy.  Besides you can't<br />Beat the price.
B004G6009K|5.0|very good ... no cpmlaints. got here very quik... love this movie had to get it and now have the digital copy too so can take it anywhere
B007EC27QM|5.0|Always handy to have, not used it yet, but it is good to know I have it when needed,besides its free.
B00DL2W7Q4|1.0|complete rubbish. unconnected little anecdodes, not real them. don't waste your time. too bad as his earlier books were well worth a read
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's fun and addictive.  But easy to spend coins on too.  A good puzzle and makes you think.  Enjoy making matches
0385721234|5.0|I was happy to have found this book on Amazon ,but my son is learning spanish. The cd in spanish would be great.The audio cassettes are far too expensive.
6305696071|5.0|Love this movie!  I can watch it over and over.  The chemistry between Julia and Richard make is great and make it a very funny movie.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|In the continung saga of Uhtred, we have been given another great story by Cornwell..  This is possibly the best of the series so far.
0783225903|1.0|Hate this movie.  Again, thanks to my husband who asked for it, I bought it.  I could not sit past the first 30 minutes.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Simply an awesome app!<br /><br />Lets you download avi videos from online video web sites.<br />This is exactly what I was looking for.
B002ZG994U|3.0|I used to watch the TV series and although not a huge fan of it, the movie was entertaining and I think well casted.
B00846REIS|3.0|The characters are likable enough and if you want a superficial easy read this would fit in that category but it requires a lot less thinking than I am doing at this moment so I couldn't gel with the series past Book 2.<br /><br />I did want a book along the lines of Fifty Shades and it has its similarities without being a carbon copy.  It was hard for me to believe in this story even though its fiction.  This read like a teenage love story not like two young adults.  I just couldn't believe that a man who was so powerful and rich would do the things he was doing and act the way he was acting.  I liked how it started with lust and I thought I would see better character development.  Sex scenes are hot there were quite a number of them so I did skim some. I did read through Book 2 but I stopped there the story just go to far out to follow for me. I thought Book 2 was a good way to conclude the story.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I really liked the story!  I enjoyed Matt's and Emily's roles.  They did a good job portraying &#34;regular&#34; people on an impossible quest.
1449410243|5.0|I've been a fan of The Oatmeal for awhile and I had to buy this book when I saw it based off the title
6305784116|3.0|I saw this movie when I was about eight years old and liked it.  I think the animation is great and the story is funny, so it's a very entertaining movie.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|This book is excellent for those in the education field who need to understand why teachers do the things they do.  I paired this books with another book on school mindsets to help shape the attitudes of my school.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is AWESOME !! Thanks for adding it to Kindle Fire HD. It was about time you guys added it . :)
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Loved this book so much.  I had a great time reading it.  It was fun journey!  I look forward to getting more of Mr. Simsion's work.
B00G32TD98|3.0|Rent it don't buy it. Not worth keeping in the collection. Thought it was going to be more scarey then what it was but it was a good movie.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|My sister and I have played stack the states on iPods along with kindles. We have been hoping that stack the countries would come to the kindle fire. We are extremely happy that it has finally come out!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The  kids love Mine Craft . Anything MINE CRAFT is pretty good. For my group of kids anyway. They play on the computer, the ipods, the xbox.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I LOVE that this film really explores the possibilities of what could be done by a person who is \\"given\\" the gift of genius!  Bradley Cooper is Eddie who gets his hands on a stash of a super secret drug that unlocks your mind's full potential.  He writes a best seller in four days, he learns foreign languages, advanced mathematics, economics and finally the concepts of global finance and makes a fortune.  BUT, he runs out of the drug.  He owes a loan shark money, but the loan shark isn't just satisfied with money anymore.  This movie is so well-written and has jaw-dropping twists that you begin to think maybe the writers were on this drug!  Completely fascinating look at human intelligence and human nature plus excellent writing and dialogue!  I highly recommend this movie!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Got all of the shows for Gifts. My husband liked the show, and I am hoping that the person getting these for Christmas will like having them to add to there movie collection.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of his best.  Great to see what happened after the Shining.  So good I couldn't put it down.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|My car came with a Dice iPod integration unit but I wanted an aux input. I didn't want to tear into my dash to get to the aux input on the Dice unit, so this device allowed me to use the 30-pin connector as an aux input. Works perfectly!
006202406X|1.0|This book was a complete disappointment to a great series, our whole family of seven loved the first two books.  We do not want to give spoilers so we will simply say we never thought an ending could be worse than Stephanie Meyer did with Breaking dawn but we were wrong!  :(
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Costly to keep advancing levels.  Would like a little more free play levels.  For a top 10 game I expected more.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Classic movie to add to any collection, My son loves this movie and so do I.Classic Disney cartoon to own...
B0050Q3TDY|4.0|This app is nice. I used to listen to a smooth jazz radio station a few years back however, it was taken off the air.  Now I can listen to this music once again with this app.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love this game, but it will not work on my kindle fire. When you get to the home screen, it freezes up, causing me to reset my kindle. But this game works on my other tablets fine. Just not for my kindle
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I don't get the 3 star average here.  This movie was both funny and fun to watch.  Jeff pulls off the cowboy act quite well, and is hilarious; he's always been a very versatile actor.  Ryan Reynolds is always funny, and paired with Jeff, they made a very nice comedic mash-up.<br /><br />The evil \\"deados\\" are attempting to reverse the flow of the tunnel that brings the dead into the afterlife so that they remain on Earth forever, and the dead in the afterlife (heaven and hell) come back to Earth forever.  Vick Walker (Ryan) and Roy Pulsipher (Jeff) -- an unlikely partnership -- must stop the deados from destroying the Earth as we know it.  The movie is full of great special effects and is constantly moving from one action scene to the other.  The car chases and shootouts are on the scale of The Matrix complete with slow-mo shots and massive building collapses.  It was really a thrill to watch.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Best game well spent  but a little hard when your trying to do bacterial on norm but overall best game.
B00BH0VSM6|1.0|I have read most of the Nordic mysteries, some of them quite predictable and not too well written. Joe Nesbo's The Bat makes the most boring ones worthy of a literature prize.<br />The Bat is a story of a Norwegian detective sent to Sydney to help investigate the death of a Minor Norwegian celebrity. In the process, he meets characters who could have been interesting had they been better developed by the writer, and learns aboriginal lore to resolve the death as well as several connected murders.<br />The plot is very predictable, characters could have been very fascinating if properly developed, the drunken stupors seemed irrelevant, and many situations seemed improbable.<br />I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I expected so much more from this book. I just can not get over all the references to farting.A bit ridiculous.
B0047T86G0|5.0|Not sure if this is the plugin version or stand-alone version but be careful when ordering and call Amazon 1st. I wanted stand-alone and ended up with plugin that only works within other Kindle Books. Either way, excellent publication.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Love this app.  Was in a store on a Saturday getting ready to purchase an electronic product.  Pulled it up on this app and it was $30 less.  I ordered it on the phone and it was delivered on Monday.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Picked it up for some light beach reading, but ended up finishing it on the first day. Overall an enjoyable book.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Can't remember the last time a movie gave me so many chills and genuinely startling moments. Highly recommend this film to anyone looking to subject themselves to a scary evening.
0812982622|5.0|This was an eye opening book. I felt that there was hope for the North Korean people despite the mass brainwashing that they live under. I came away with hope for them and their offspring.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is like 10375936492661077 times better than minecraft with mythological beasts and super cool weapons. I recommend buying it.<br /><br />AWESOME
1401230067|4.0|has all the original stories that i remember very cool and interesting read i want to own the whole collection and read them on rainy stormy days so i can get into the comic better, john constantine is awesome.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really glad this came to kindle. It's really great to have and a lot of fun. Finally got a friend to play!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Loved it! Love is the same throughout the ages. Recommend that you read the book before you see the movie.
B0044IJ1S6|5.0|EXCELLENT!! Must own!! Pure audio, clear video. Super high energy show fueled by Dave. Martin really shines on solos. Just unbelievable concert.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This was an amazing movie! I loved it! I recommended it to all of my friends and family members. I plan on watching it again.

B000NY12CI|5.0|A very interesting book about religion, injustice, love and hatred. I recommend it very much. A book that makes you think a lot.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a classic John Green book. I was not disappointed whatsoever. It was a very quick and easy read about young love and death. John Green stayed true to form. If you're a fan of him, you'll be a fan of this book. The only thing I disagreed with was the ending. Wish it had an epilogue or one more chapter. Overall, it was very moving
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome, simply put in one word. Collins' ability to grasp the reader's attention and maintain a level of suspense is unmatched. Can hardly wait to start  book three in this thrilling series!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Exceed the expectations<br />Highly recommended ... don't waist your time on other products<br />Go for this super headphone<br />Very unique one
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It is just another way of getting more money from you.I have the Bejeweled 2 game and I can go from one level to another without paying . I would not recommend this game to anyone!!!!
006202406X|3.0|Certain plot points felt either rushed, unnecessary, or nonsensical. Hated the ending...that death was not necessary to close out the series properly. However, there were some high points, particularly with the interaction between and evolution of the main characters (which made the ending that much more frustrating). Overall, an average book with equal amounts of shouting \\"yes!\\" and \\"no!\\"...a disappointing conclusion to the trilogy.
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|Great clean fun and though some of the ecological concepts aren't fully fleshed out I found it to be a really enjoyable film altogether. Folks who are enjoy the writing of author David James Duncan will find a lot to like in this film.
B00E3BK0QQ|2.0|It's an OK game but the free version doesn't let you get very far before you have to pay $4.99 to unlock further scenes. Unless you really like this game, there are much better ones available.  Also, after downloading and installing the game, the first time I opened it the message \\"Downloading game data.  This may take a few minutes.\\" appeared. I took ALMOST AN HOUR to complete downloading the game data.
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|First time watching it all the way though..  Loved to be able to watch it with PRIME. First movie I've personally watched on Prime and it was easy to find and picture quality was great for a old'ish movie (can't say its too old cus its as old as I am)  If I could afford to right now I'd buy it in the set.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Very Disappointing - I am using a Kindle Fire.  When I got to the point where I opened the box, the game closes.  I even tried to play the Epilog and again the game closed.  I uninstalled the game and downloaded and installed it again but still had the same problem.  Note: a friend of mine has the game on his IPad and does not have this problem.  If you are a Kindle Fire user don't waste your money or your time on this rip-off.
B00AUAL9T6|5.0|As a movie to watch on Halloween I couldn't have chosen a better DVD. Pedro Almod&oacute;var's film, The Skin I Live In (we watched the original Spanish version La piel que habito, with excellent English sub-titles) is a movie that proves the power of the imagination is far more chilling and intense than any graphic or gratuitous violence can ever be.<br /><br />It's impossible to review the movie without giving away too much of the complex and clever plot and it's that which keeps you breathless throughout the whole 115 minutes. All the cast presented superb performances, from the brutal Zeca (Roberto &Aacute;lamo) to the foolish Vincente (Jan Cornet), from the blindly loyal Marilia (Marisa Paredes) to the haunted Vera(Elena Anaya).<br /><br />However, it was the commanding performance of Antonio Banderas as prominent surgeon and researcher Dr Robert Legard who played a pivotal role. In the hands of a lesser actor, the labyrinthine torment that motivated Legard's actions could easily have become parody; Banderas played the role to perfection.<br /><br />Although Almod&oacute;var kept the tension high right until the penultimate scene, the final scene was less satisfying than the rest of the film demanded, although I'm sure many viewers will be perfectly satisfied with it. If Banderas' performance of Legard had not been so immaculate, I may have been satisfied with the ending but, as it is, the complexities of love and desire which were explored in the final stages of the relationship between Legard and Vera had too-convenient a resolution.<br /><br />Still, it was a strong enough ending to keep the movie a 5* viewing experience that is both thought-provoking and powerful. And far too scary, even for Halloween!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|the hidden object games need to be better sized on screen,could be more interactive with story,  other than that good game.
B0015KGWZG|5.0|Loved this book. I recognised myself in so many ways, and now have the keys to make positive changes. Thank you Wayne.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was obsessed with this game and then my mom and step- grandma were playing it on their iPad. I was so excited to see that they Finally got it on the kindle no I don't need a computer every time I want to play this game. :)
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Poetry........ pure poetry :') there is nothing better then sitting with your bro watching some zombie's being killed haha loved every second of it and can't wait for the rest of the season!

B00FWPWNKS|5.0|This is a great game that gets increasingly difficult as you progress.  I love Match 3 games and this one ranks up there as one of my favorites!
0440246016|3.0|After the movie and all the high ratings of these books, I decided to try the highest rated Reacher novel. I really don't see what the big deal is, wasn't that good. It was okay. But not 4 1/2 star great.
0553801473|5.0|I loved this continuance of the fire & ice saga. It fulfilled anticipation for &#34;what's next&#34; in the stories. Well done!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I love history, but I had no idea of Nikola Tesla and his far-reaching effects on our lives today.  A great read.  So sad that Tesla died penniless because of the greed of another.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|71 and the Man STILL Rocks!Saw Sir Paul at Safeco last July, THANK YOU, Mr. McCartney for a WONDERFUL evening!
B0000041DF|2.0|Her skills as a pianist are obvious  but I too, like a previous reviewer, couldn't get lost in the music as I normally would any Rachmaninoff composition. It was too rushed and lacked compassion.  Speed shouldn't be a criteria for judging a pianist. There were times when a lighter touch was needed but it was lacking.  Rachmaninoff is passionate, beautiful music and I felt nothing but disappointment while listening.  The quality of the recording was very poor and the orchestra really  makes a difference.  Hugely disappointing from a technical viewpoint.  Orchestra and recording sounded almost amateurish.  I actually thought one of my speakers might have been disconnected.  Look for other recordings.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The whole book was painful to read. I kept pushing through to read it hoping it would get better. Maybe Veronica Roth just wanted to finish and get her payday rather than actually putting any thought into what she was writing.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|My kids love this game.  Keeps them busy when they are waiting on me in the morning before school. Love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is perfect for people who love horses. Natural motion has outdone themselves with the wonderful graphics and realistic sounds. If you love horses then this app is for you.
B003B02O14|4.0|A fairly quick read, good story but perhaps the ending was a bit predictable. Main character very methodical with a bit of drama.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So didn't have to type it in kindle all the time, when I was somewhere with WiFi  , it saved time
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is amazing it get the job done if you have a virus or jammed up files etc. this is the app for you trust me easy quick it awesome at lease give it a try
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|It was a game on my old computer which I like a lot so that's why I got it on my kindle
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game although it gets a little glitchy, but I work with it. I like the plot line that goes with it
B004OEJMZM|5.0|Great book with a lot of useful examples. I recommend it for anyone who interested in programming for Linux* OS.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|The movie kept me laughing. Great performances from the characters and I love all the special effects. Want a laugh rent the movie.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This reads like a crime novel--but it's not fiction, alas, and no one has been convicted of any crimes, doubly alas.  Michael Lewis personalizes the complex and turbulent history of the financial skullduggery that led to the catastrophic meltdown of 2007, rooted in dubious floating subprime mortgages sold to greedy or unsuspecting borrowers, inflated immensely through complicated pernicious financial &#34;derivatives&#34; fertilized by willfully blind ratings agencies.  But Lewis writes from the standpoint of those few who saw through the folly and shorted the &#34;doomsday machine&#34; that was bound to fail.  Shorters  bet on failure, and so run contrary to the reigning optimism.  Yet these social outcasts were right, and the optimists were deluded by greed.  There was enormous profit to be had in leveraging other people's money to buy and sell financial fabrications.  But the inevitable collapse, while it injured millions, left the financial titans mostly unscathed--and, mostly, enriched personally, while the general public paid the bills.  True crime indeed, and your blood will boil with anger at the scoundrels unpunished.<br /><br />Lewis writes a compelling narrative.  It will increase your understanding of the financial shenanigans, and possibly deepen your cynicism about Wall Street.  But you will find this story fascinating.  It reads just as well as a good novel.  Too bad it's not fiction.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm 22 yo girl and my friends daughter plays all the time so I ended up getting my own kindle and downloading it. though the mini games get a bit tedious I love how they bring in parts of the show to make it more entertaining like I'm rebattling nightmare moon in a secondary show Thule thing. overall its awesome wish hearts were easier to get but I still love it
B0064MGU98|5.0|Fantastic show!  Can't wait to see the rest of the seasons! The first season grabbed me from the minute it began, and hasn't let me go.  I know I am a few years behind, but am so glad Amazon has it available because I intend to catch up soon!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This book is written in a casual style without the burden of the scientific jargon but still you learn a lot about your brain and how the memory works. I learned several tricks that improved my memory being the memory palace once of the greatest.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read The Shining shortly after I reached puberty and I slept with the lights on for at least 3 weeks after completing the book (which I read in about 3 days!). And you couldn't pay me to go near a hedge that looked like anything other than a hedge!<br /><br />While this book was not quite as scary (or maybe I'm just a little older and not as easily shaken), I still could not put this down. Stephen King is the absolute MASTER storyteller of all things creepy. And no matter how creepy the characters are, he always manages to put some \\"humaness\\" in them-which somehow makes them a little more scary.<br /><br />It was great to see Danny's transformation into hell and back to life. I'm truly anxious to see what path Abra's gift will lead her on.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. King, well done!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|This film needs no further reviews, but, if you've read Rebello's excellent book and want to see what the Production Code (censorship board) people were arguing about with Hitchcock, you won't see it on any Universal Blu-ray disc, only on the DVD. The morons who author Universal Blu-rays saw fit to slap a big bar across the screen whenever you pause the film, and it doesn't go away, even if you advance the frame. Since the portion of the frames that caused the contretemps are now covered, you can't see what the argument was about. In effect, Universal has censored Psycho more effectively than the Production Code people in 1960. This is true of both the 50th edition disc and the Blu-ray box set of Hitch's late films.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I can't get this to work on my kindle fire hd. I have tried to make it work. I have nothing more to say.

B005DOL0R0|5.0|Great patting to protect the kindle fire<br />Great way to store and even travel with your kindle fire<br />Good quality good price<br />Would recommend
B004LROUW2|5.0|its an amazing story. It took me out of this world. I literally read it in four days because I couldn't stop.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I'm going to get straight to the point. If you only watch one Western in your lifetime, it should be Once Upon a Time in the West.  Its cinematography is incredible and holds up beautifully still today. The sweeping vistas of rugged desert scenery are a great representation of the hard, frontier life one imagines these folks to have lived.  The story is complicated, and is not for the impatient soul.  You are more than an hour into the movie before you really know what is happening and who is trying to do what to whom.  But its slowness is part of its beauty, and for me, helped to build tension until the climactic scene where Bronson and Fonda give us what every Western film is born to try and give.  Even that big scene unfolds slowly though, so different from the way such movies are filmed in our time.  Leone takes his time with each scene and every sound, every movement seems important, meaningful. Oh, and I'm not one to care about costumes in a film, but the clothing worn in this movie just oozes cool.  The dusters, the hats, the close ups on the faces, they way the gunmen fill the doorway in the general store, I hadn't felt that way about the style in a movie since I saw the Matrix.  In the end though, a movie hangs on its story and for my money Once Upon a Time in the West is a great one. I'm not going to say much about that, as I hate to spoil plot, but it's a compelling story that requires some mental participation and problem solving.  This isn't a film for the passive observer.<br /><br />There's decades of competition in the Western genre both before and after this incredible film, but for my money this was as good as a Western gets. I can't recommend it strongly enough, and am curious as to why it isn't mentioned more as one of the great classics.  Nobody should call oneself a fan of the Western and miss this one.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So much fun to play! Fun and challenging! Will definitely be on the lookout for other G5 games!<br /> Hopefully updates will be coming soon.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Simply outstanding. Impossible to put down. This is a gripping and emotional story told with passion and eloquence. Must read.
1401938906|5.0|Miracles have happened when I've done these experiments! Short and sweet and a must read! This will change your life!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I have been a rather passive fan of QotSA for the past decade or so. Ultimately, their music was very hit and miss for me. This album is an ostrich of a different stripe though. This is just a brilliant walk instead of a disjointed sprint. When you take the whole body of work in the first time, it's kind of overwhelming. Give it about three runs through the system and you'll start to see what makes this special. Sincerely, this is one of the best albums I've purchased in years. Give it a go and you will not be disappointed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Really great book.  The political intrigue is very well written, and just when you think you know how things are going to turn out, things change completely.  I was sad some of the characters didn't make it, but man what a ride.  This book sets the stage for massive amounts of conflict.  I hope the sequels are as good.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|this game is great. I feel like its realistic. its challenging and lets you build your dreams and launch them off into space
0385536828|3.0|No time - sorry. To Amazon - Do I get a reward for my specialist knowledge? Sorry it's so short but did my best!!
B0096HFD8W|2.0|Scream 1 was decent but the franchise just goes downhill with every movie. Pretty typical though. And just not scary enough
B008P76UKE|4.0|I love it as it embraces the beauty of the Ring but is not as long! A powerful rendition by Maazel who wrote it and directs this performance.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is fun. It may take a while to build up your armed forces if you don't want to spend any money, but it is a good time killer. Works well on the Kindle Fire.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love it<br />It's fun playing and helping friends . You just need patients unroll you get friends to help. generally try it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.  Love the movie &amp; love the game.  Hours &amp; hours of fun ... great game.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|They just don't make kids movies like this anymore!  So glad I introduced it to my kid.  It's a favorite for all of us now!
B002SRQ214|4.0|good processor, used it as an upgrade to an aging core 2 duo processor in my old gaming rig. stock fan is horrible, listen to the others and get an aftermarket cooler. it will litterally sound like your turning on a hand vacuum every time you turn on your computer

B00FWPWNKS|2.0|Paid for this game on my Kindle, however, it completely FROZE around Station 10 - can't get it to do anything.  VERY disappointed because it was really a fun game.  I there anything I can do to get it started again?
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|I own a vintage Pioneer silver era stereo, the SX-780. I have a pair of bookshelf speakers that I built myself using high quality drivers from Part Express. They outperform most anything that can be bought for under $1,200 here at Amazon. Sometimes, I employ a powered sub-woofer when listening to my collection of music CDs and iTUNES rips, and sometimes I don't. For this CD I am not, but I highly recommend one unless you have big, full-range speakers; some of the tracks on this CD go down pretty low.<br /><br />I cannot overstate how important it is on how to set up your speakers the proper way when listening to 2 channel stereo music, whether it's on CD or vinyl or downloads. I don't care what kind of speakers you have, high end or consumer grade, if you don't have a big enough listening area where you can set up your speakers properly, you will be missing out on a lot of the sonic joy that most great recordings offer.<br /><br />I have a fairly large garage that I converted into a man-cave complete with a great music listening area. In this listening area, I have my speakers set up very carefully with regard to maximizing stereo separation, imaging, and depth of the sound field. In other words, I did not have to compromise on where I placed my speakers and the listening position like before inside my house.<br /><br />I have my pair of speakers separated several feet away from the back wall and 12 feet apart from each other (this distance is probably the single most important thing I can recommend when setting up a stereo listening area). They sit on stands and the tweeters are at ear level. My listening position is another 12 feet away from either speaker creating an equilateral triangle. Both speakers are also several feet way from their adjacent side walls. I have both speakers firing directly at the listening position (this is called toe-in and is dependent on what type of speakers you have.) THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD BE LISTENING TO MUSIC IN STEREO. I have enough things on the walls to break up reflections; and I have a rug that covers the cement floor between me and the speakers, again to break up reflections. For the most part, this listening environment is pretty great -- way better than an office or small bedroom where the distance between speakers is pathetically small, and better than most living rooms where the space between speakers is only 6 feet or so.<br /><br />I like to listen to music pretty loud and at night in near total darkness. The darkness helps tremendously in order to get to that hypnotic state where you become one with the music. If it's a day after some heavy stress, I'll drink a cold one - or two - to help me relax.<br /><br />(I checked out the CD REFLECTOR at my local library. I'll probably buy it here later on for Christmas as a stocking-stuffer.)<br /><br />NOW FOR THE REVIEW of THE CD, YES THE CD, OF REFLECTOR:<br /><br />There are actually 2 CDs containing a total of 13 tracks, 7 and 6 respectively.<br /><br />After one full listen from beginning to end of BOTH CDs, all I can say is WOW! Arcade Fire have outdone themselves on REFLECKTOR. What a journey! It's a pity that I had to get up to change CDs, because it kinda broke the mood, or the TRANCE that I was in. The sound is big, but not loud. It's full, but not too overblown. Is it a victim of LOUDNESS and COMPRESSION? Maybe. Maybe not. But its fullness and bombast are used to full effect, creating a wall of sound that will suck you in. There are plenty of attacks where the sound level reaches its highest point, and of course, there are some quiet passages, too. It felt great. I could hear each of the different sounds easily in the mix, whether its vocals or drums or the synth flourishes splashed throughout each track. In fact, both vocals, Win's and his wife's, were clearly arranged right to left when they were singing together. As for the depth of the sound field, it was as much right in your face rather than laid back. Of course, the wholealbum is not some laid-back affair like a Steely Dan album. It's more like U2's sound from the '90s. Big and Bold, but bigger and bolder. I really liked it. It felt like I was wrapped in sound and just taken for a ride. I'm not too sure, and maybe someone could chime in here, but Arcade Fire may have broken some new ground regarding sound mixing with their use of effects. They have really come up with some unique, great sounding stuff here. All in all, just a wonderful sounding CD, and I hope Arcade Fire continue making great music.

B001NLKT60|1.0|This book ponderingly slow. It has one of the worst heroines in lisbeth salander in all of literature. At times I was waiting for her to leap a tall building in single bound . This will be the last Larson novel I read what a waste of time.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I must have missed something!  I loaded this app because the news said it was great fun and &#34;addicting&#34;.  I didn't pay much attention as I went through the first 6 levels; really quite underwhelming.  Then on the 7th level I was challenged to achieve a certain number of points in a certain number of moves and instructed to &#34;get rid of the jellies&#34;...what were the jellies...those things that looked like jelly beans or everything?  Well, while I think I earned the minimum points, I failed to achieve level 7...several times.  And each time I was given the choice to pay 99 cents for the opportunity to keep playing.  Really?  Must have missed something.....

The stylus is not compatible with the Lifeproof Fre case. The case has a screen built with it, and the stylus just doesn't work smoothly. You have to press hard to get it working. Some other styluses, the cheaper ones work so much better with the Lifeproof case.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Great thriller.. Keeps you on your toes.. Totally unpredictable.. Love the non-linear narrative.. Rose Byrne and Glenn Close are excellent.. Must watch!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Beautifully written and constructed. The build up of a revolution, the resistance, the new Games. Loved it in its terrifying beauty.
B00005KB9W|4.0|Thought per description, that I was purchasing new expanded remastered version, only to receive regular version, which was let down!  Make sure to purchase expanded version!
B003G4W49C|5.0|It is really good. Surprise ending and addicting. I recommend you to read it. After reading you should watch the movie
B00E38KGF4|4.0|It works like it says. The only drawback for me is it has to be on the internet to function.
B001DTTG16|4.0|The movie was very well done.  I love the come-from-behind story with a beautiful girl who's a welder by day and a dancer by night.  The acting was great.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is easy to play and relaxing. The intervals are distracting when additional options are offered but this is a marketing process.
B008Z9L94O|4.0|True highs on the 4 vinyl set. Some lows, but not many. A true classic, happy to pick up the re-issue.<br />To me not a 5 star album but plenty of 5 star songs.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Touching.<br /><br />I could relate to the story personally,  I found it to be well written as well as plausible. Thank you.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I love me some free classics, especially sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I only need ten more words; okay that's it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My kids love this game. It's indepth but simple. But still let's kids learn patience and preserverance. I find myself playing it often.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Loving this season so far. Just as gut wrenching, entertaining, and unpredictable as the seasons before it. Can't wait to see where it goes from here.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy to finally have Candy Crush in my Kindle. I am obsessed with this game and have had it on my IPhone for awhile,. I love the larger screen of my Kindle Fire.
B00932DCS8|4.0|2012R: Interesting story that didn't require I read every single subtitle to understand which led me to the inescapable conclusion that there's simply too much talking in most American films. The Norwegians seem to have also mastered the Sergio Leone cinematic feat of being able to convey many messages without words. Nice job. Enjoy MFJLabs 4x
B002361MLA|5.0|Helped me through a difficult and depressing time in my life.<br />Ekhart tolle is a genius.<br />Amazon kindle order was perfect and I couldn't be happier about my purchase.
1587143879|4.0|This book is definitely more accurate, but the way is written is a lot more difficult than for example the same book from Todd Lammle, which is unfortunately  missing some of the stuff. Also the practical part available is pretty tight, basically even u spent a money for that u still need to buy more of his products. Its like buying car without the wheels and windows. But as I rated - its good
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was wondering how long it would take to get on the kindle!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this game!!! My goal to 3 star each level!!!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This is an interesting and attention getting series. Enjoyable, without violence, explosions, bad language, etc. I recommend viewing to all audiences.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game it keeps you on your toes. You play and play until you run out of lives and lose track of time love it.I recomend. it to everyone
1401917186|5.0|It gave me insight into myself.  I've known I was a Lightworker for a few years already, but did not know that much about the Earth Angels.  I love most everything available from Doreen Virtue
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I can learn, practice and have fun at the same time. Everybody should have this app. I think that is so cool.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|too much too connected with others was looking for a more Uno game than what I already had wasn't impressed
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story is just AMAZING! The story line totally went beyond my expectations as I didn't expect that John-Paul have killed Rachel's daughter Janie and the how each characters are being linked up is just awesome!
B00821OX98|5.0|This tale of post-war earth is very well told.  I enjoy the fact that you meet the aliens early on and that the aliens are very well done.  The story is an interesting mix of trying to learn about the aliens while trying to find ways to kill them and survive at the same time.  The series had me hooked right from the first episode.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is everywhere these days but it is hard to forget the first experience watching this amazing actor in &#34;Sherlock&#34;. Martin Freeman also does an excellent job impersonating Dr. Watson, allowing the viewers to find our way into Sherlock's world. At times exasperated with Sherlock antics, but always with a deep humane perspective, Dr. Watson is our window into the deductive powers of the greatest detective ever (with excuses to Hercule Poirot).<br /><br />Steven Moffat continues to excel in bringing to us excellent TV. From his times as the creator of &#34;Coupling&#34; (the original BBC series, not to be tarnished by the American version) to his current post as &#34;Dr. Who&#34;'s show runner, Moffat has been creating intriguing plots and allowing a level of character development that makes these characters as real as possible for the audience. If one wants to know what Sherlock would be if transplanted to modern times, this is what they should watch (not the trivial, although entertaining, &#34;Elementary&#34;).
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing.  Passed the time on airplanes and in airports.  Not terribly difficult but enough of a challenge for me.
B00000J2SO|5.0|Rainbow they are a great band they put a lot of good music you know from back in the 80s and 70s probably a message outstanding I really like it to everybody out there and I'll try the music they bring forward
B008BM9L72|1.0|Just another Mills and Boon type publication just a bit dirtier.  I suppose it did have a story but too much kinky sex and was totally boring and skipped over to try to get the rest of the story.
B001NTJTUY|5.0|This is a remarkable composition composed by John Barry for the film. RACHMANINOV: Piano Concerto No. 2 / Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini as the theme. However, this was my parents favorite movie and music and being so, it was fitting that it was played at our mother's funeral service.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great characters, even if the outcome is expected the story keeps you interested. Grisham is consistent at keeping me reading. Another great vacation two day read.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|These puzzles are fun and allow you to change how many pieces you want to deal with.  A great way to relax for 5 or 10 minutes during a busy day
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I finished this book in one hole hour I absolutely love the series. If you could have unlimited money on this unspoiled buy the whole seris
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is the greatest app for kids I would download it if I were you. My daughter and niece love this game and always wanna play it when they are here and home. Thank you for reading review please download if u have kids at home all ages would love this game.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Have read this book time and time again...it never loses its luster. One of the best novels of all time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game play it all day err day. that's what it do baby ya ya what what
193700788X|3.0|Oh, how much I've loved the series, but the ending, and loose ends broke my heart. I still admire Charlaine Harris for her wonderful books, she's written so many. I'd adore having one more a surprise or a WoW  Sookie Stackhouse MOVIE !!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is amazing on Blu-Ray. Anyone who loves the Sound of Music should have this set. The scenery is beautiful.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Enjoy story line and with the variety of choices on how to proceed, the choices that have been made/written are very good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and very addictive!!!  My kids, 11 and 8, love it too!!!  Very easy to learn right from level 1 and passes the time quickly!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is a really fun game play all the time can't stop playing really good game  awsome graphics overall fun game.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I really like this movie. Great music, good fun, good story, fun characters, well done.<br />Although it must be said I like stand alone movies, sequels, series' (long & short, digital & written) & even a lot of the remakes. All I have to do is fall in love with a character, plot, musical score, setting, story, actor or something & I'm in! ;-)<br />& this is one that I like!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I am very glad Amazon finally finally got the app for kindle. I'm addicted and loving it. I'm usually reading but since getting this game I have not finished a book in weeks.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I really like this movie and/or series. Good fun, good story, fun characters, well done.<br />Although it must be said I like stand alone movies, sequels, series' (long & short) & even a lot of the remakes. All I have to do is fall in love with a character, plot, setting, story, actor or something & I'm in! ;-)<br />& this is one that I like!
B0053JJLLC|4.0|All of his books are a good read. At times this one was a tad too technical but I still found great deal of pleasure in reading it.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I really like this movie. Great musical score, good fun, good story, fun characters, gray action, well done.<br />Although it must be said I like stand alone movies, sequels, series' (long & short, digital & written) & even a lot of the remakes. All I have to do is fall in love with a character, plot, musical score, setting, story, actor or something & I'm in! ;-)<br />& this is one that I REALLY like!
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Glad to see it free on Amazon free app of the day. Bring more games like this out.  Fun puzzles and forgiving at times.  The jumping train cart can be a pain.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Haven't seen the show, read all the books & I really really like this series. Good fun, good story, fun characters, dark humor, well done.<br />Although it must be said I like stand alone movies, sequels, series' (long & short, digital & written) & even a lot of the remakes. All I have to do is fall in love with a character, plot, setting, story, actor or something & I'm in! ;-)<br />Dexter (and his inner monologue) is laugh out loud funny to me!<br />But not for the squeamish.
B000002TQV|5.0|Classic RH. Every song is a critical form of poetry, which you can always expect from Radio Head. Just one of many must-haves!
B003477DVK|5.0|A very sweet movie.  I always like Kevin Bacon and Harry Connick Jr. as the narrator was superb. Frankie Muniz adorable.
B000V7J6E8|5.0|One of two Joy Division's is a &#34;must have&#34;. The second live CD is awesome. I lost my first CD and had a burning need to replace it and very happy I did.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I really enjoyed the story. I think ms Gilbert has put the eat, pray, love phenon behind her. I couldn't put this down
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Classic film that anyone can enjoy. It does have a bit of violence and swear words, but it's the 80s that's how films were. Great actors and character. Music is awesome.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love having choices of stations for what I'm in the mood to listen to.  I love the oldies channels that are no longer played around my area so am often listening to the oldies but goodies!  Please keep up the good work!
B008ZVJE3A|5.0|Already a classic in the documentary genre. Lot's of lines you'll want to remember to sprinkle into conversation (Most amplifiers to to 10. Our amplifier goes to 11). Great ensemble cast went on to do &#34;Best in Show&#34; and others of that ilk.
B00382S9SC|5.0|Fantastic! i live in a rural area and watching this is really amazing. its my get away. i love all the different levels of everyones personality.
B004132HZS|5.0|Amazing modern take on a beloved classic.  Cumberbatch is the sexiest Holmes ever!  The episodes keep you guessing all the way through.
B0041OOEJY|5.0|Great kids movie.  Jackie Chan always a plus. Fun and exciting for whole family.  Promotes and celebrates moral values and work.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent read. Hard to put down. Stephen King remains the best at what he does. I'd love it if this was the first of many sequels to his novels.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch certainly nails a modern interpretation of Holmes. I also enjoyed the characters of Irene Adler and Watson. Although for Watson I had hoped for a little stronger of role such as Jude Laws'
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has a great way to keep you involved from beginning to end and he does it again and again
0985557834|5.0|My boys have learned to make a lot of new things from the ideas in this book.  The pictures and descriptions are helpful.
B00571F26Y|1.0|More about the history of wheat rather than a sensible way to diet. Seems to feel that if we ate like the cave men of 10,000 years ago we'd all be better off. With an average height of 5 feet 2 inches and life expectancy of 25 years. Go figure. I D rather have a like expectancy of 83 and height of 6 feet eating wheat.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The series has everything...  Imagination, good vs. evil, excitement, so totally different from anything else airing. (Though I do see some copycats starting to emerge)  It takes all the familiar bedtime stories and fairy tales, and because of a curse of the &#34;black queen&#34; opens a portal to a small town in Maine where all these people (characters) now live unhappily ever after.  Until Emma is brought to town to break the curse.  The rest you need to see for yourself.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|. . . . by the imagination and creativity of Robert Kirkman and Greg Nicotero!  The Walking dead is absolutely the best show on TV!  Strong characters and exciting story line.  Realistic sets and incredible make up. The zombies are the icing on the cake!  Don't worry about the gore - once you're hooked you don't even notice it.  Thanks, Amazon, I love being able to buy the latest episode the morning after it has aired - watching it twice Sunday night is just not enough.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Received the watch yesterday. Love it at the first sight! It looks good. Very light for an automatic watch. It only weighs 2.2 oz. I have over a dozen watches, including some expensive ones. The Armitron automatic weighs 5.3 oz. The Bulova quartz weighs 3.3 oz. The Movado quartz is a bit lighter than the Bulova. It is hard to imagine an automatic watch can be this light, especially at this bargain price.<br /><br />The watch was running when I received it. So I did nothing except adjusting the time, day and date. After wearing it during the days since yesterday, I check the accuracy using my atomic clock. Surprisingly, it keeps exactly the same time as the atomic clock! Not even one second too fast or too slow! I cannot be happier! I was expecting 5 to 10 seconds off.<br /><br />Maybe one day of testing is not enough? I hope it will keep its performance like this for years.<br /><br />Some reviewers talk about the ticking noise. I can hardly hear anything from the watch unless it is within one inch from my ear. I hear exceptionally well, but this watch is very quiet to me.<br /><br />This watch is probably the most satisfying watch I have ever bought. It is also among the least expensive.<br /><br />I am a 6', 200 lbs guy. This watch looks good on my wrist, not too small at all. It is so light that I often forget I am wearing a watch.<br /><br />Update 11/3/13:<br /><br />Found a way to keep the watch accurate!<br /><br />The watch gains a few seconds per night if you leave it face up. It loses a few seconds per night if left side way. So every night before going to bed, I check the watch with an atomic clock or computer, and then decide how to put it for the night. Voila! It is always very accurate! No more than 5 seconds off!
B0037B6QSY|5.0|I thought it was a very truthful book on what to expect to expect from meditation  I also liked how the booked gave many ways to meditate.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is my first S.H. Figuarts figure. I was really happy to get the extra faces! They look awesome! The hole figure is really nice, great paint job and posability! I look forward getting the entire salior scouts team!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Definitely would recommend this game. Got it as the free app of the day. Need more good games like this!
B002UNMW7O|4.0|A good sequel to the first movie about two brothers who become vigilantes & kill the worst of the worst after giving them the last rights. A good action movie with A good story.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|This was another hit for Pixar. It was fun with a lot of action to keep your attention. The kids and grand-kids found it was a very good movie to watch with the Grand folks and it's one we don't mind watching over and over.
140006922X|5.0|Great book to give the reader chilling details about the political climate of those times. A good companion read is Killing Jesus by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard. Mr. Asian does not use the gospel writers for historical reference as do Mr. Oreilly and Mr. Dugard, but even so, Mr. Asian admits something major happened after the death of Jesus that did not occur after the death of others who claimed to be the messiah. I highly recommend both books. Benn Haynes
B001NA6096|4.0|A lot of dialog but liked it.  We like Ethan Hawke.  He had commented that this was the lowest grossing trilogy of all time.  We saw Before Midnight and liked it and decided to go back and rent the first part of the trilogy.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Perfect condition. Wonderful movie that I would recommend to anyone with an open mind. My favorite movie of all time.
B00DJYJQ36|1.0|This has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever watched. Very disappointed, since I've noticed the reviews have been really good. I just don't agree. If you want to watch a movie that will put you to sleep, this is it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved the way this story unfolded.  Even though my parents were American, they lived through World War II and that made the story particularly enjoyable
B005544TRQ|5.0|Like &#34;White Collar&#34; without the &#34;bad guy turned good guy&#34; mentality. Witty, intelligent, charming, and a bit nerdy. A very fun show to watch!
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I love it so far, but it takes time to learn all the things that you can do with this program. I started trying out the different sizes of paint brushes. Also working on created my own color palettes, like I have in my own studio at home. I like the idea of sometimes taking my 'Tablet' out in the field to sketch and paint on site, without the hassle of bringing along all my art supplies. This program is great for quick drawings when we go out for a Sunday drive!!<br /><br />Check out all of the drawing & painting apps on Amazon.com, if you like to create!
030758836X|1.0|I can't imagine why this book received so much positive press. The prose is overblown and poorly edited. The narratives of the husband, Nick, and the wife, Amy, go on ad nauseum, but offer nothing that makes either character remotely sympathetic, or even interesting, unless, perhaps, you are a prison psychologist. This book may work for some as a send-up of a bad marriage, but does not illuminate or enlighten us about human relationships, emotional truths, or mysteries of intimacy anywhere on the spectrum of normal human interaction. As far as I am concerned, it violates the first rule of fiction: give us at least one character we actually care about. Gillian Flynn makes Jacqueline Susann look like Jane Austen.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|It really hit home for our superstitious sports fans here.  Aside being from Philly, it's a wonderful film!  Just fun!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Love this show. I tell everyone to watch it! and to watch all them!  Great series!!!!!!! Watch it now !
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is very addicting~ The more you do--the more you want to do. Great game for all ages!<br />I am not a gamer, but I love this game!
0345529057|5.0|This set is amazing!  My son really likes this series and was so happy to get it! The story must be pretty interesting!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun and relaxing after a long day always look forward to playing after dealing with nothing but stress all day
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does what's it claims to do, unlike some apps out there. Finds and fixes. Seeks and destroys. Sweeps and clears anything on my device that doesn't quite need to be there(embedded adware is even discovered this way occasionally). I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD as well as my Android smartphone-both work incredibly well. Download it, or you'll be overflowing with junk files and apps, and nobody will sing songs to you, or your pals. Yep.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Its a cool gamers. I play it on my s4 . Its especially for free. Try it if you like sharks and killing people's. Its a real blood bath if you know what I mean ...... The first is that the only one that has the same thing. It 4 9thnext
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen. The writers were able to make a great story without taking up my time in watching car chases and sex scenes. The cast is great and although fiction, it provides a look into the past as to what life may have been like in that era.<br /><br />I enjoyed this immensely!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|GREAT ACTING AND GOOD STORY LINES.  FAMILY FRIENDLY TOO. I LOVE ALL THE ACTORS.  THEY SEEM TO HELP WITH GOOD CAUSES.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Great cd. Its really cool to hear the man in black cover more modern music. Well worth the money to have music history.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone<br /><br />Really a Mind bender,could not stop reading.After I was finished reading could not help but wonder how many people actually live that way.All show .Not to the extent of . This couple of course . Would read another book by Gillian Flynn . Did she or -----
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love the game. It`s fun. It is addictive to play. I hope you had fun playing the game. I had fun.
B004JMY312|5.0|The grandkids cannot stop watching this movie. Not sure why, but they love it. I am sure your kids will too.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|OMG I was looking for something fun to do but no because the camera is upside down.  It happens only with the kindle fire
B00847KFDS|4.0|John Fogerty shows that he is still one of the best songwriters out there. A unique collection of some of his old standards, redone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely love this book!!! I would recommend this book to anyone. You will love it. Great job, 5 stars no doubt.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great movie! This movie is of course a revisit of Star Trek II - The Wrath Of Khan, albeit in a different timeline, but it is well done! The 3D looks great on my LG TV.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie, although not as good as the first. Wonderful action, awesome graphics and let's face it, it's Star Trek. I don't know if the Blu-Ray makes a difference but this bundle is a good deal.
0767919408|4.0|Combines well-known and obscure historical vignettes brilliantly woven together. A nice summary of baseball stories and Babe Ruth, revealing his childhood passion and an ode to his father a baseball journalist.
1476727651|5.0|Was a gift to my daughter she said it was Great! She reads everything that Stephen King writes he is her favorite author .
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I've read Allie's blog for quite some time and have been waiting for more. I devoured this book and hated when I had to put it down to sleep and work. My husband would give me serious side eye when I would snort laugh through each chapter. Loved this!
0767919408|4.0|Really makes you feel that you are there in the time period !  It is a very good book and I always love how he goes off the subject and delves deeper into the story !
0451419243|5.0|The author followed through with the characters he first introduced in Fall of the Giants. He carries them from the rise of Naziism to the end of World War II. Having been alive during that period I found it very well done. It is a long book but I thouroughy enjoyed it and look forward to the third one in the trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game but I'm not going to lie...I'm not addicted<br />Everybody is talking about it though<br />It made me feel great
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Great message! Nice to see Snoop doing a kids movie. Guy was a great example of poor sportsmanship. music was exciting too
B004SBX112|5.0|pretty good app except the update I blame amazon all other devices get updates early except kindle fire<br />so yeah
031623480X|5.0|Cool book that will help you lose the weight you need.  you must change your life now and follow the paleo life style!

B00FI7XBIS|5.0|cute little game. caught it when it was free for a day. amazon kindle fire first generation plays well on device.
B000I5X81K|2.0|Bought this for my wife. I'm not a fan of this style of music, but she loves it. The man does have talent, I will give him that.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|So far so good, I keep it in my truck or back pack, seems to work great on my serrated edged knives.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Awesome! I love the walking dead and the new season is proving to be pretty awesome. Is it just the flew?
B001NLJ33K|5.0|Brilliant ambiance and cinematography.  Good story for a film that flows effortlessly.  When this movie first came out and I saw the previews, I scoffed at even the idea of watching this thing.  Looked silly and and like just trying to capitilize on another tv to movie adaptation.  But Mann comes through and delivers a powerhouse film that even Jamie Foxx cant seem to make dumb and frivolous.  In the end, you are swept away by its aura and ability to hypnotize you.  Sweet ride.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is just an awesome series....has a little of everything in it that a show can portray & done well....can't wait for season 3 & am def going to read the books!!
B006LR0XLM|2.0|If you have a Dropbox account, get Dropsync Pro and use it instead. It's well worth the $$$ and does everything you need.
B001EBV0NA|5.0|A Classic.<br /><br />The standard that set the bar & pushed the limits.<br /><br />Nothing else needs to be said..this is the one to watch.
0071766588|1.0|The CD does not work in a MAC even though it says it does.  I ordered it and thought my copy was defective so I exchanged the whole item and the new one had the same problem.  After this a friend of my kid told her that she had the same problem and now my daughter is forced to usa a borrowed pc to use the product which is obviously MISLABELLED
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown does it again.  An entertaining follow up to Angles and Demons. A fairly quick read that had me entertained from beginning to end.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This novel is very engaging and heart wrenching.  I loved following all the characters and the unusual circumstances of the secret which is the heart of the novel.  It is very easy to identify with the characters and so captivating that I didn't  want to put it down.  Highly recommend this novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very entertaining book...I'm glad I got this e-book and plan to read this again and again.  Great book.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  :-)
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|This movie is just alot of fun, especially for anyone who grew up to the original Wizard of Oz as a kid. The 3D is done very well and just adds to the overall fun factor.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very entertaining book...I'm glad I got this e-book and plan to read this again and again.  Great book.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  :-)
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This book is so different from most book - a love story so funny and unique - was a lot of fun to read in two days - could not put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Tried not to start another game, but ha  to see what everyone was talking about.  I must admit it...I love  this game!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Great story.  Wonderful in twining of several generations. A recommend for those who love family stories of deception,love, lies and well being!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|If you enjoy Stephen King novels you need to read, or at least listen to this one.  I did both and I'm glad I did.  It's not something I would reread, like I did with Salem's Lot or The Stand, but it was truly worth the effort.
B00104W8T6|5.0|Great music, very quirky.  Makes me feel happy just to listen to it.  I ordered it because I enjoyed the film.  Be warned, though, I find some of the tracks stay in my head all day!  However, I don't mind.  Also, throughout the film, it is hard to concentrate on the lyrics of the songs, but with the soundtrack, you can appreciate their cleverness.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Horrible ending to a great series. The writing this last season could not have been worse. The actors and the audience deserved a better fate than this! It should come back just long enough for Dexter to do the just thing and end up dumping the writers of this final season off of his boat into the ocean!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a very good receiver it loads the movies very fast. Where I live only Internet available is 5megs and even with the slow bandwidth I have no load lag with Netflix or hulu and YouTube. First one worked so good I ordered 3 more all work as good as the first one did.
0385523394|1.0|ordered in September, still havent gotten it yet, can someone tell me why is that? Is it lost or what?
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|For a free game was definitely fun a little difficult but worth it. I would buy this app if it wasn't already the free app of the day.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I love this game! Trying to stay one step ahead of the spiders gets challenging but it's excellent. One of my all-time favorites.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I viewed Breaking Bad on Netflix because I could not get past the introduction to Breaking Bad on Amazon, even though I paid the $11.99 fee for the first season.  Netflix provided a smooth transition between segments so I intend to view the rest of the segments on Netflix.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Loved it!  Classic Miyazaki, even though it has no fantasy elements.  Much more similar to &#34;Whisper of the Heart&#34; vs. something like &#34;My Neighbor Totoro&#34; or &#34;Howls Moving Castle&#34;.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|I ordered this because I thought a game I started playing on a friends device. It is actually a game I have already purchased and played called &#34;100 Rooms Escape&#34;.  While not a bad game in and of itself, it was not what I wanted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! It´s gripping. Once you start , you can´t stop playing. It makes you think and some stages are really challenging. Amazing.
0800141806|5.0|It was a fantastic movie, makes me cry everytime I watch it.  Tom Hanks brought the tragedy of this disease out into the light.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Purchased a pair of these headphones in the early '90's. I loved them then and still love them  now. I was happy to see that Sony is still making them.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This game is geared towards folks like me who don  like birds or crushing candy.  It's great on My IPhone but only good on the kindle. Game is the same but different.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Love this movie and I'm looking forward to my daughter enjoying it just as much as I do during Christmas!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Brilliant work from the best writer of our generation.  Doctor Sleep is a great read and a worthy sequel to the Shining.
1401940676|5.0|This audio book completely changed my perspective of life. My whole life I've been doing the &#34;right&#34; things but I wasn't happy and I wondered why. This book explained it so well that what others perceives as &#34;right&#34; might not be right for you. That we are all individuals very different from each other and the only way to be truly happy is to not follow others but discover ourselves and simply be ourselves. Decision making used to be very difficult for me but now it's simple: if the decision is made based on fear then it's wrong, if it's made based on passion, then it's right.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think this game is fun, but don't see why everyone else gets hooked on it.  I guess I am not very good at it.  It is worth getting esp if its free.  I love mindless entertainment and it really passes the time if you have to wait somewhere like Dr. office.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games is really awesome and these mionions are so ardorable I think the person who made this should make a despicable me too I love your game once again.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|Great cpu performance, and has allowed me to game non demanding games on full max 1920x1080 resolution. Has made it much easier to save up for a great gpu.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I really like this game, and for me it was free, and the graphics are good and there were no pop ups, but I really wish chapter two was free, because I got this one for free and I go to look for the other one, and it is three dollars. that was extremely dissopointing
B00F880BWG|5.0|This show does nothing but deliver.  Pure Gold! The special effects get better and better.  I'm looking forward to the spin off Series too.  I hope it gets the green light.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for Android is the best app And keeps me reading when I am waiting for an appointment, sitting at home, at the park...I also have books for my grandchildren to have something to do with them as we are sitting together in the car, at home...LOVE IT!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I purchased this book in Kindle format because it was on sale, and I do not regret it in the least.  A friend of mine recommended the series to me a long time ago.  I enjoyed reading a new take on the classic themes and characters found in mythology.  The sort of experiences that young Percy has resonate because they're the same experiences and emotions that real people can have (at least in general) no matter what genre the story might be, and that's why the narrative is interesting:  there's something real in it even though it's so heavily in the realm of the fantastic, and some of his experiences and struggles hit really close to home for me and I'm sure for other people.  Even though this is a young adult novel, it still has appeal for a grown-up audience, and that's why I don't doubt I'll reread it later.
006202406X|3.0|**Some Spoilers**<br />I'm a fan of the Dystopian genre, but sometimes I have a tough time with the YA ones, I have to remind myself these are teenage characters, they are not adults, but face adult situations so I try not to get so frustrated with them. Allegiant was just okay, Divergent was the best of the trilogy though I loved that their society was just a part of a big government experiment and that the Divergent weren't actually \\"needed\\" in the world outside what was Chicago. Yes, the ending was sad, Tris and Tobias fought so hard for the chance just to be together, but I'm not mad Tris sacrificed herself for her brother. It may be hard for some young readers to understand, but Tris knew Caleb wasn't sacrificing himself because he loved her, but because he felt like he had to because he had betrayed. Tris loved her brother despite everything and there is no greater sacrifice than that of your life for someone you love; just as her mother did and just has for father did for her. I respect this choice the author made. With Tobias and Evelyn, I know some readers are mad about how easily Evelyn made her choice, but I'm okay with it. I don't think Evelyn actually wanted to lead the people into a war with the Allegiant or be the leader of a new society, I believe she just wanted revenge against Marcus and with over taking the factions and putting him out of power she did that, so yes, Tobias was an easy choice for her, she loves her son, I think that's all she ever really wanted. Over all I liked the series, Hunger Games is still the better YA dystopian trilogy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I can't remember who first introduced me to The Piano Guys, but I saw them first on YouTube.  Someday I'd like to see them in person, but for now I have this wonderful CD to listen to.  It helps to have already seen the corresponding music videos on YouTube for some such as &#34;Cello Wars,&#34; and &#34;Peponi&#34; (for example) is another visually appealing video as well, but it's still very interesting regardless.  I enjoy creative and well-done compilations from people who apparently love what they do.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|This video presentation of \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\" is a Metropolitan Opera production that opened the 2007-08 season, this particular performance is a live performance that was broadcast on high definition to movie theaters across America in February, 2009. I found this performance to be highly moving, poignant, and enjoyable. The director, Mary Zimmerman, creates an atmosphere through the production and performances that give this classic tragic opera, with its \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" tones of a doomed love affair between two members of warring clans,  the feel of a Hammer horror film, which is not to say this a \\"dumbed-down\\" production or an exercise in directorial-indulgence in \\"opera-horror kitsch.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Zimmerman seems to understand that \\"Lucia\\" is, at heart, a horror story, and, like all great horror stories, it knows what scares us. This production over the years has received criticism for straying too far from the basic text; with the critics noting such directorial touches as showing the specter of the murdered young bride Lucia has visions of in the glade in Act I, and of having the cast members pose for photographs during the wedding reception near the end of Act II. Too much business, they say, or showing us literally what should be left to the imagination.<br /><br />But opera, I feel, is a medium that is not always just about leaving things to the audiences' imagination. Opera, at its best, takes the audience members into the imagination; the imaginations of the characters and, most importantly, into the imagination of the opera's original creators. It is through this dynamic that opera can plumb the deepest secrets at the heart of the human experience. In the case of \\"Lucia,\\" the opera is about delivering powerful insights into mortality, and death, and the agonizing question of what, if anything, we leave behind us when we disappear into the void. Whether we remain after death on this earth as a wraith or as an image in a photograph, Ms. Zimmermanis telling us, at best it is a faint image of who we were when we alive, and often a false image at that.<br /><br />Natalie Dessay sang \\"Lucia\\" when this production premiered in 2007, by 2009, when it returned to the Met, Anna Netrebko, the Met's chosen superstar soprano, had assumed the role. In this performance Ms. Netrebko clearly shows why she  has established herself as arguably the leading soprano of our age. Keeping her face mostly blank during this performance -- her Lucia seems to know that even her happiest moments will ultimately bring her nothing but grief -- she delivers a Lucia who, in the introductory words of Ms. Dessay is a \\"victim of men and circumstance\\" who can only claim her autonomy by stepping outside what passes for the moral pale.<br /><br /> Many productions present Lucia as a woman who is driven to the brink of madness, Ms. Zimmerman, wisely, casts her as sort of a fun house mirror image of Jack Nicholson's character in Stanley Kubrick's film version of \\"The Shining.\\" There, Nicholson's character was over-the-top crazy from the word go, a dizzying black hole of energy, an example of American can-do spirit taken to its sociopathic conclusion.  In this \\"Lucia,\\" Ms. Netrebko perfectly captures the emotional toll taken by sensitive women in Victorian Scotland, where smiles are about as rare as actual sightings of the Loch Ness Monster. She just keeps internalizing the repression within, until she reaches the psychological tipping point. When this Lucia emerges from the bridal suite, wrapped in her blood-drenched gown, she's an avatar of the deepest psycho-sexual fears of both genders.<br /><br />Ms. Netrebko's performance of the famous \\"mad scene,\\" featuring flute and glass armonica solos under Marco Armillato's spirited direction, is heartbreaking, as we see and hear Lucia's imploding  psyche with our own ears and eyes. Mariusz Kwiecien, as Lucia's conniving brother, brings a strong physicality to the role, and suggests that his relationship with his sister, may be more than kin and less than kind. The real story of the cast, however, may Piotr Beczala as Sir Edgardo di Ravenswood. In her introduction, Ms. Dessay tells us that Beczala is a last-minute replacement, and that \\"This could be his moment.\\" He certainly seizes it, beginning with  his initial duet with Ms. Netrebko near the end of Act I, winning over the Met audience, which is not always the most supportive of opera-goers.<br /><br />This Deutsche Grammophon DVD, produced in partnership with the Met, features superior sound and picture quality. By this point the Met's production crews are veterans at presenting HD performances, and mix in enough mid-screen and widescreen camera angles and shots so that we can  enjoy the full visual power of this staging, along with the requisite close-ups of performers and musicians. This package also includes a handsome booklet complete with synopsis, cast and production credits, and an essay on this production of \\"Lucia.\\" Additionally, unlike several other Met HD videos I've seen, this \\"Lucia\\" has the between-acts interviews as separate features, enabling the viewer at home to watch the opera straight through, with no interruption.<br /><br />Opera purists may question some of the directorial choices made in this \\"Lucia,\\" then again, most opera purists would probably be against HD presentations to begin with. For general opera fans seeking to build their own home video libraries of the canon, this DVD of \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\" is highly recommended.
B004QSQMKE|2.0|The soundtrack on the director's cut is nothing like the original..take note, you will not be able to enjoy it quite the same way. Bottom line
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game Is so exciting it will leave you always wanting more. It is so . Good you won't want to put the game down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought the book was well written. Can't wait to read The third book.  This has a beautiful love story's
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The zoom button is the place where you should navigate. When you zoom and switch the weapon, the another weapon is zooming too, it is deadly most of the time.<br /><br />The assault rifles category is not have any automatic weapons, so they are NOT assault rifles. Do not mix political confusion is a hunting game.<br /><br />Otherwise nice graphic and game play. I like the weapon upgrades too.
1616550414|5.0|It's a beautiful book with the complete story of the Zelda series. It's definitely a must have for any Zelda Fan!
B008RKKUZ0|5.0|I like this movie not as much as the Addams family values but it's a good movie to watch I recommend it !
B008Y6YEQS|4.0|Great movie and it brought my kids to a more modern version of this tale. You'll enjoy it as well.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great Book!!! I really like how Rick Riordan does his plot lines and I am impressed by the fact that each of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians all made best sellers!
B00DJSUORE|5.0|ATDI's power album.  Song writing and composing growth reaches a new level for these musicians and the production values really capture it well (an issue for some earlier albums and many live ATDI & Volta live shows).
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is blood sucking awesome !!!! This game is of the chain !! It pretty amazing how .... sike this game is cool .... takes the boring out of me but thats it .... !!!!
B0016OOS16|5.0|Works like a charm. I bring it with me on travel to work in SolidWorks and it hasn't let me down yet. Software installed and runs easily. I love how much customization you can do with sensitivity in every direction and which direction does what, and can create different customizations for every piece of software (e.g., SolidWorks vs AutoCAD).<br />I would've preferred a hard shell travel case to the soft one provided for additional ease of mind during travel.
B008220C38|4.0|This version is not the best, I have seen five different Anna Karenina movies, I love the story, everyone offers something different, the costumes are really nice, but I don't care for the stage type presentation.  Amazon is a good thing on internet buying regardless of the quality of the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really fun, addicting game. By the title and the fact that it is based from a kids cartoon movie, it seems like it would be a kids game. It really is for all ages. It is a cute version of the classic running game, but with some extras thrown in. There are battles while you are running and different locations. Also the goals/ objectives keep it interesting. Overall a really great game with the cute little minions.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is fun and amusing. I can't stop playing it. The flying goat things are kind of weird. But still it very fun.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Best metronome that I have tried for Kindle and my generic android tablets.<br />Slide the bottom half of the screen to find all the options. The &#34;Play&#34; button might not be<br />obvious. Tap the play icon in the upper right section to start it.<br />Very pleased with all the features. We used to have to pay for a dedicated metronome years ago<br />that didn't perform 1/2 as well with so many sounds and options. Well worth the download.
159463176X|5.0|I was very excited to receive the package since this book was written by one of my most favorite authors. Am so glad i received it on time!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Don't read this book if you liked the first two. I realize the first two books were silly meaningless reads, but this one makes readers feel terrible after finishing it. I regret reading the entire series now. I would have given it zero stars if that was an option.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Loved it and my daughter loves it too. Perfect for a 4 year olds beginning Lego collection. Lego is such quality.
0241966833|5.0|There is only one Zlatan... and you will know his greatness after reading this book. A must read for fans of Ibra
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Good story that you need to keep reading. Couldn't put the book down until I finished. Can't wait for the 3rd book in the Trilogy.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|This is a very readable book and the content is straightforward and easy to understand. The science behind this way of eating is well researched and the anecdotal  evidence is overwhelming. As a failed overweight dieter I have found this programme really manageable and not at all stressful. I was surprised to find that I was losing weight steadily and after three weeks have lost 2.5kgs
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and Joss Whedon. Never knew the two would get together. So glad they did.<br />I have seen this play several times but the modern setting made it so fresh. The language is always difficult but the actors delivery and timing made it very understandable.  Buy it or rent it.  It is very worth your time and money!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I got this app last year, AND IT SUCKED! Then I got it updated, and now I can play Vocaloid, Zelda, and Hetalia music and I'm happy! They added a ton more instruments and songs to it! But only 4 stars because you have to pay for most of it -_-&quot;
B0042TV4IW|5.0|In depth characters, good acting, story arcs are well interleaved and engaging, If you liked Anne of Green Gables and/or Downton Abbey this may be for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game it is a great stress releaver. Some of the levels are very challenging and get a little frustrating. But still a very great game.<br />Glad my face book friends got me hooked on this game.
B000002AT6|5.0|One of the most satisfying movie scores I've purchased in many years. I'm usually disappointed in James Horner's soundtracks for their lack of tracks that can stand alone as musical pieces. They may work just brilliantly as background music to whatever movie, but his music tends to lack solid structure when you hear it out of context. This score satisfies. It's lush and evocative and haunting. Beautiful score and beautiful music.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I downloaded this game on Halloween and it really filled my holiday spirit since I don't trick-or-treat. Even after the holiday, I'm still engaged in this game.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Final chapter in the trilogy is, as usual, a wonderful read as are Ms. Atwood's other works. As a finale, she allows more time to spend on developing characters, both new and ones we already know from the first 2 books. In terms of post-apocalyptic fiction, Ms. Atwood sets a standard that few other writers in the genre can equal, let alone surpass.
B000002UBU|4.0|Don McLean.... Ooooooh. An amazing singer with an impressive range. Bought this cd because it had the full version of American pie on it. It also had Vincent, one of my favorite songs. The rest were new; id never heard of them. Everybody loves me baby is hilarious. All the songs are good, most are excellent.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Outstanding! Amazing how this man tells a story. Faulkner would be proud of him. A beautiful and thrilling book. A great read
1451666179|5.0|The genius of Allie Brosh is that she makes you feel like she's inside your head. Or that she's your best friend. She's remarkably good at expressing her feelings on seemingly trivial topics that others have overlooked-- her material isn't stuff that's been done to death, but the smaller things that we don't usually talk about... like how you get halfway across a grocery store, decide you DON'T want those canned mushrooms after all, and then have a fight inside your head about what you're going to do with those mushrooms. Put them back randomly wherever you are, get a little closer to the canned mushroom section...?<br /><br />The funny thing is that I tore open this package, saw the cover, and immediately sat down on my stairs and smiled, looking at it as if I were about to read a friend's book, and I was so proud of her for getting it published. Then I remembered that Allie Brosh has no idea who I am. She's my secret friend. So secret that she doesn't know it yet.<br /><br />She expresses things that are apparently very common human emotions and tendencies that we don't talk about, and she does it with these primitive cartoons and really funny commentary. She's so beloved that she disappeared for a year and no one forgot about her... how often does that happen?<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't thrilled with the format choice for the book. I thought it should have been a wider/larger book, because some of her stuff works better when you can see more frames. I'd even venture to say I preferred reading it online... scrolling rather than turning the pages felt more natural to me, but that might just be habit.<br /><br />The new material here is just as good as the old material. It's all pretty awesome. And I'm still proud of her.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Backgammon was extremely easy to play & understand the rules. If you have tried the board game then this is for you.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a very good series. My husband and I both enjoy watching it when we get ready. Looking forward to season 2.
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|Well built, with easy access to ports while protecting the power and volume buttons. But doesn't feel like it would help protect from falls (bumper doesn't feel substantial). Decent for a lightweight case that showcases the iphone rear panel.<br /><br />Plastic looks great when you first remove the protective film, but very easily scratched. Already, i found scratches where my phone slid into the case. So be prepared to buy a replacement pretty soon if you're particular about the clarity of the clear plastic panel.<br /><br />Overall, acceptable for the price (~USD10), and comes with a decent SPIGEN screen protector.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think it will be a great winter time game when it is cold and blizzarding when there is nothing to do outside!!!
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|Barbara is amazing. This movie is a must see. It really gives you strength and see things differently especially after s break up
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Funny movie, great to pop in and watch on a lazy day. Some of the humor is a little crude but nothing too bad to watch with the whole family. My 10 year old has been into aliens since he was very little and he loves this movie. I like that this movie isn't about destroying the Earth or all out war.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|I kept wanting to know what happens next which is the mark of a good story. Soul stamps are a clever idea.
3836504715|5.0|Excellent book with a excellent price.It shows the true spirit and look of the Paris before 20-eth century and modernization comes.A must have book for all  photography lovers!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read the book series and love every one.  It was so wonderful to see all the creatures come to life and how well the movie followed the book.  I will watch this over and over and sure hope there are more movies to continue the saga.
B003MYYJD0|4.0|The frist watch was damage return was very quick and refund was within 48 hr in my bank !! Great<br />I then Pruchased a another watch and that one is perfect !<br />Thanks
1451666179|5.0|I love this!! Allie Brosh is hilarious. Her stories make me laugh so hard my stomach hurts and I cry. Her illustrations are good at portraying what she's talking about in a silly way. I highly recommend this book to anyone. I rarely buy books these days, I  mostly check them out from the library. But this is definitely one I needed to have in my personal book collection.
B000ID37KO|3.0|Great picture quality,  the cast  and plot is interesting from the beginning of the film. The film is not completely full of horror which is good for me.
0061438294|3.0|I'm giving the book 3 or 4 stars because it didn't go into as much detailed as I had hoped. It is a thought provoking book though. I read it to learn more about the body signals I send out without knowing as opposed to reading other people. I think I'm pretty good in that department. Simple things like splaying your legs make you look more powerful(like you own the place); raised eye brows means you really like the person in which you are in conversation with; and other simple things like crossing your arms when you feel threatened or rubbing your neck when you are in distress or blinking when you are lying( not you though, you never lie ;) ) . One thing that really stood out for me was the bit about having both thumbs up and arching your fingers together in a unique way( as if you are transferring energy through your finger tips ) during a presentation, that would contribute to a very strong presentation. I believe all these are mundane things that everyone subconsciously knows but reading it in this book makes one consciously aware of it. I think a pocket book edition would be great too.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I have such a big spot for this movie. .. the musical scores are great and the story line grabs you and may get a little teary eyed.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Overall, entertaining.  Definitely have to suspend skepticism for it.  Liked the characters.  Best part was the short movie after the end that pulled it all together, make sure to catch it.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|I can't believe I heard of this show and til now seen an episode. Hope to have time and watch all seasons.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the things John Green exceeds at is dialog, and because he is a best selling/award winning novelist, he has good readers.  I know this review is under the book, and it'll be a wonderful experience reading it.  I just want to also recommend the audiobook.<br /><br />I can't remember when I laughed and cried equally in a book.  Fabulous.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I got this app for one great reason . to drive my wife nuts. you know that sound a dripping faucet makes in the middle of the night. three one that keeps you awake. drip....drip...drip. yea it can replicate that. start it up hide it somewhere . and watch the tossing and turning . what's that sound? she asks. I don't  hear  anything . I reply. yea this is one great app.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|though circumstances are tense and their is a looming oppressiveness to Eleanor's home life, the deep heart and sweetness of a pure love shines through.  So very well done.
6305232660|5.0|Item arrived on time and as stated.  Deep impact dvd has some great actors in it.  Movie was very good.  Family enjoyed it.  Thanks for the speedy service.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the setting, costumes, writing and acting. It somehow transports me to that time, and I feel as though I am looking in on an actual family of the period.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Works great and for those that do play it on facebook... we all know how it can drive you crazy. Works perfect on my kindle fire hd. :)
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This is a descent activity tracker which has several basic tracking functions, which aides in getting and keeping track of data about your daily lifestyle.<br /><br />I can't say that I'm totally into or use all functions of this tracker, and I'm pretty positive the data isn't totally accurate, but for the basics... it is fairly useful.<br /><br />This unit holds a charge for about 10-12 days before it needs to be recharged, which is much better than any of my previous activity trackers. The size is pretty small and easily fits in a 5th pocket, but heed caution and don't forget that it is in there or it could be a valuable mistake.<br /><br />However a few things like this bother me...<br /><br />1. It relies on other systems to show data (Apps, iPhone, table, etc...) instead of being a standalone system.<br /><br />2. Price. With the aforementioned, what are you actually getting for money? (...for half more money you can invest in a new tablet or even a new smartphone and get other online apps for free. like... pedometer, diet, altimeter, etc... )<br /><br />3. The touch screen is a little insensitive and takes patience to operate. (Could just be a defect in this unit)<br /><br />Otherwise it is a descent tracker, but could use some tweaking.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Very informative documentary by Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation.  This is a film that everybody should watch before spending their next dollar on food.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This album grows on you. There's lots of variety on it, and the moods are as varied as are Paul's myriad musical styles. The &#34;hit&#34; from the album that's getting the most air play only goes to prove that nobody but McCartney could possibly pull off a rhythm and chord progression a la &#34;Penny Lane&#34; but Paul, and have people LOVING it instead of bemoaning its being passé. It's anything but, and Sir Paul proves it. We should all be so lucky as to be 71 years old and come off as if he were 30!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Okay, I'm a guy, and I really like Castle.  My daughter got me to watch it, and I've been hooked since the middle of the second season.  We went back and caught up on the first season, and part of the second,  My daughter wants to have them, so I buy the DVDs so I can clear some space off my DVR.<br /><br />Wish they made these in Blu-ray.<br /><br />As for Season 4 of the show, some shows are always better than the others, but I thought the season as a whole was very good.
B004QNN1UI|5.0|Mick Hucknell exemplifies the absolute best of blue-eyed soul, as only the Brits can do it: to perfection. I've been a fan since the first time I heard them in the mid-1980's. Here it is, over 3 decades later, and Mick is if anything more powerful than he was all that time ago. This concert contains both a bang-up DVD of the farewell concert of &#34;Simply Red&#34; at the Sydney Opera House, but a CD as well. I'm not easily pleased, but believe me: This set is a must. And the price is a steal!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love the show.  Love the DVDs and the extras.  I didn't start watching Big Bang Theory until I decided to last Fall.  Been catching up ever since, and glad to be able to get the DVDs.

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Arcade Fire's \\"Reflektor\\" gets better the more I listen to it.  At first listen I wasn't sure it was a great album, but with each listen I find more interesting sounds I didn't hear the last time, and that is at least one of the things that helps an album to be great for me.  Arcade Fire has taken on something of a very large scope here, and for the most part they fire on all cylinders.<br /><br />Fans of James Murphy (LCD Soundsystem) will hear his soundprints all over the recording, as he was involved in much of the production.  Plenty of beats, plenty of keyboards, and lots of ear candy.  In some places this de-emphasizes the vocals a bit in the mix, and it makes for more of a \\"wall of sound\\" than we've heard from the band in the past.  But with each of their albums comes something different, and this is what they're doing this time out:  having some fun.  Murphy doesn't step lightly here, but he doesn't trample either.  He and Arcade Fire are a good mix.<br /><br />Due to his presence, some might argue that this album is more about sound than substance, more about form than content.  I would tend to agree with that to some extent.  But if you are willing to listen with an ear toward perfection in the product, and if you like that sort of thing, you will love this album.  And some will argue that the album lacks heart because this time out it seems to be more about the sound.  To you I would ask, \\"Have you heard much of anything that sounds better this year?\\"  There is plenty of heart in here, and the heartbeat is strong.  Listen to how the heart sounds, and you will hear how vital it is.<br /><br />The lyrics do wander around at times, but they get tied together, sometimes with a single line that is sung in such a way that it suddenly stabs you.  \\"You Already Know\\" is an example.  The verses almost seem banal, but then the chords change and Win Butler sings \\"Please stop wondering why you feel so sad, when you already know... Please stop wondering why you feel sobad, when you already know.\\"  I've been there too, and in that moment I'm cut to the bone.<br /><br />The subtle arranging touches throughout the album add extra power.  An instance of this is the French lyrics in \\"Joan Of Arc\\" and how they add mystique, and then the sneaky guitar at around the four-minute mark of that song adds some musical heartache.<br /><br />This is an album of moments.  The songs have grooves you will settle in and get comfortable with, and then a subtle shift causes the \\"wow\\" response to kick in... you will suddenly find yourself in a different place.  This happens throughout \\"Reflektor\\".  It's because the songs are all expertly arranged and performed, and all are designed to thrill.<br /><br />I questioned the inclusion of the long, ambient fade at the end of the album-closing track \\"Supersymmetry\\", but after listening to the album all the way through several times, I now see that track as the musical equivalent of something like afterglow or a cigarette after an hour or so of ecstatic activity.  It fits just fine.<br /><br />\\"Reflektor\\" sounds great when it's played loud.  Turn it up.  Dance, and celebrate.  The band is no longer the eccentric outfit they were on \\"Funeral\\" but they are still very worthy of your love.<br /><br />Love them, and love \\"Reflektor\\" too.

0770437400|3.0|I bought this book after reading Max Brook's Zombie Survival Handbook, expecting it to be another great piece of zombie literature. As with any zombie book, I ate it up, but I didn't care for the format. The diary format isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think that this one jumped around too much and made it hard to follow. It would have been easier to follow if it had been in the style of the Adrian's Undead Diary series by Chris Philbrook.<br /><br />Not saying that this is a book to pass over, but if you're going to spend money on a zombie diary, go with [[ASIN:149356871X Dark Recollections: Adrian's Undead Diary Book One (Volume 1)]]

B004PJG7MW|3.0|It is supposed to be a PG movie but it is full of bad language. I remember watching it on tv as a kid and thought I would let my children watch it. I had to stop the movie because of all the bad language in it. I wish there was a setting on amazon that would bleep out the bad language on movies like this to make them kid friendly.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a good story (although I &#34;got it&#34; half way through). It's light reading, although one could argue there's a general poke against unjustified convictions and judicial corruption.

I had a few instances that the puzzle froze on my Kindle Fire, and had to shut down the Kindle. This worked until I did an update for Magic Puzzles. After that I was not able to work them again. I deleted and reinstalled without success. I wish I hadn't updated.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As a voracious reader of John Grishman, Sycamore Row returned me to his first blockbuster, \\" A Time to kill.\\" For those who have not read A Time to Kill, it is not necessary to enjoy this latest novel with the same protagonist and settings.<br /><br />Transporting us to Clanton, Mississippi, Jake Brigance has not yet recaptured his triumph from a previously racially provocative murder trial.  As a trial lawyer, he has yet to litigate another powerful verdict.  He is a bright, young attorney with a beautiful wife and schoolteacher, Carla, and young daughter, Hanna.  They are living in a small, rented home since their beautiful Victorian home was set on fire by the Ku Klux Klan, who remained active in the 1980's.  The KKK was not happy with the verdict, needless to say. Jake needs the action as much as he needs the money.<br /><br />Now it's 1988 and a strange, aloof millionaire commits suicide by hanging.  He has planned his suicide in detail and reverses his prior will, which was rudimentary leaving his fortune to his children and their heirs.  Instead, this last will leaves 90% of his considerable fortune to his black housekeeper, Lettie Lang.  Seth Hubbard sends Jake a new, handwritten will by mail. Based on his past performance, he chooses Jake to defend the will and warns him of the difficulties.  It is terse and although, Hubbard's words are carefully chosen, it is maddening, so much is left out.  Why Lettie? It is Jake's responsibility to defend the will and he is up against highly paid competition from the children's attorneys.  Anytime there is significant money, we know there will be vultures, high emotion and lies upon lies in a good mystery.<br /><br />Grisham does not disappoint.  This is a long novel.  He mirrored the monotony of the many facets of the law.  We meet Ruben Attlee, the curmudgeon Judge, intricacies of the depositions, discovery and the nasty behavior of the defendants and their attorneys.<br /><br />Our Jake is centered among the fascinating Southern characters, who all seem to be drinking. There are dirty tricks, surprise witnesses and he is up against a large legal team on the opposing side.  He does receive good advice from his cronies and it sustains him, but the decisions are up to Jake.  He has an ace in the hole with Lucien Willibanks, his landlord, a devoted drunk and a disbarred attorney.  When Grisham takes us into the trial phase, I am once again confident I am not missing a detail of how it actually would unfold.  It's my type of novel, it's Southern with the usual decadent cast of characters, lots of booze, a decent main character and, of course, a long-lost relative with a shocking and shameful revelation which pulls us and the jury out of our tedium. You need to sit through the proceedings, Grishman wants you to understand the working of a trial and you better enjoy it.ing Southern characters, who all seem to be drinking.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this not having researched all of its capabilities.  It is nice for a few things, but could definitely be more functional.  Currently you can use your phone/ipad (i'm an Apple guy) to stream netflix (as long as they're connected to the same wifi network), and you can use your computer to stream a tab from Google.  This is the only way I've figured out to play video files from your computer or to play streaming videos from online.  It would definitely be a better product if it could somehow take video files from your computer and stream them to your tv.<br /><br />It is, however, $35, so I guess I can't expect everything (but it's Google so I can!).
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|After Donna Summer's untimely death, I expected a deluge of tribute material.  Unfortunately, not much has been released.  THIS is the best they can do?<br /><br />This is almost impossible to listen to.  The beats are very tired, and rather than highlight the music, the mixes appear to want to take Donna's songs in different and strange directions.  I always thought remixes should attempt to improve on a song, not distract from it.<br /><br />One song (\\"Midnight Shift\\") doesn't even use a Donna Summer vocal!  How is that a tribute???<br /><br />I would AVOID this release.  It does not do justice to the memory of Ms. Donna Summer.
B00FGKF888|1.0|I bought this book for my ipad/kindle app, was really looking forward to reading. However once I opened it in Kindle I soon experienced buyers remorse! All the interviews/text cannot be enlarged/zoomed in to read. The only option is double tapping the text to enlarge, but it only does this a paragraph at a time! The print is a bit ugly when scaled up and is only scaled about 2x's what is on the page. Horribly formatting for this book. Try ibooks for a better read!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Rothfuss is an amazing writer. His narrative voice is engrossing, mesmerizing, and &#34;The Wise Man's Fear&#34; upholds the standard easily.<br /><br />Some people have pointed out obvious shortcomings of this work. Certain portions of the story seem like jolting tangents. The plot goes in one direction nicely only to be jarred to a halt as Kvothe jaunts off to some unrelated adventure. And each new tangent becomes long and involved beyond reason. There is some truth to these criticisms, but I'd like to defend some of it. In each divergence from the supposed plot, Kvothe learns and becomes something and someone new. His random adventures follow a particular string of thematic material: namely, the waking of his subconscious mind and the discovery and mastery of important principles. Whether he's hunting bandits, exploring the world of the Fae or studying martial arts, Kvothe is consistently on a journey of discovery. That journey is often frustrating and even boring at times, but it does maintain the story's consistency. The truth is that Kvothe ends the story a different person than when he started, and each divergence of the plot was a consistent step in that change.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot. To some it may seem like juvenile, disjointed randomness, but to me it felt like an old style faerie story in the vein of George MacDonald. That said, I am critical of the pace of some of these stories. Certain parts dragged on. And on. And then...on. And on. Hence, four stars instead of five. But well worth the time.

1423113462|4.0|Rick Riordan's five Percy Jackson novels were all phenomenally successful tales of adventure that captivated readers through retelling and modernised reimagining of the Greek myths. Although the Percy Jackson cycle seemed to have been wrapped up nicely, fans were hoping that Riordan would eventually return to the Greeks and the world of the demigods [after having branched out into Egyptian mythology with The Kane Chronicles] and he has now done so in excellent style with The Lost Hero.<br /><br />Set a few months after the events of The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero begins during a Wilderness School [a sort of educational Last Chance Saloon] fieldtrip to the Grand Canyon. Jason wakes up on the school bus with no memory of why he is there nor, more troublingly, of who he actually is. It's all particularly strange since everyone else seems convinced that they know him and so Jason has to adapt to apparently having a girlfriend named Piper, a best friend named Leo Valdez and even a disapproving teacher in the form of Coach Gleeson Hedge. Things only get stranger for Jason as the school party are attacked by a group of storm spirits, Coach Hedge is revealed to be a satyr who talks tougher than he fights, and Jason discovers that he's a pretty nifty swordsman who happens to be able to fly. My school trips were never this exciting.<br /><br />Luckily, fan favourite Annabeth and a cohort of other demigods arrive by flying chariot and whisk Jason, Piper and Leo off to the relative safety of Camp Half-Blood. Once at Camp Piper and Leo are promptly claimed by their godly parents but, despite Chiron seeming to have some insight, Jason's origins remain a mystery. Although he has no memory of his past, it is clear that Jason is no stranger to the concept of gods and demigods even if his knowledge owes more to the Roman tradition than to the Greek. While Jason is keen to discover his origins, Annabeth is more concerned about locating the missing hero, Percy Jackson. Fortunately, Rachel Elizabeth Dare, everyone's favourite redheaded Oracle, is also back at Camp Half-Blood and able to deliver a handy new prophecy: &#34;Seven half-bloods shall answer the call,<br />To storm or fire the world must fall. An oath to keep with a final breath, And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.&#34;<br /><br />As rumours of a terrible curse - and talk of the missing hero - swirl around the Camp, it becomes clear that Jason, Piper and Leo are the chosen ones who must embark on a terrifying new quest to rescue the imprisoned goddess Hera. If they don't succeed by the time of the Winter Solstice - now only four days away - the world will once again be facing deadly danger as the gods retreat to Mount Olympus and leave the demigods to fight for humanity in their place.<br /><br />The Lost Hero is a great book in its own right and is an excellent introduction to Rick Riordan's new Heroes of Olympus series. Although readers could probably still follow the events of The Lost Hero without being familiar with the five Percy Jackson novels, there is certainly a great deal more to be gained from the story if you are aware of Riordan's previous work. Although Percy himself is not involved, a number of established characters besides Annabeth, Chiron and the gods themselves turn up throughout the course of the book and there are frequent references to previous events.<br /><br />The style of The Lost Hero is noticeably different from the Percy Jackson books as, logically, it is not humorously narrated in the first person by Percy, but is instead told in the third person with Jason, Piper and Leo taking it in turns to be the central focus of two chapters apiece. I don't think that The Lost Hero loses out through being a third person narrative, indeed I like the additional points of interest that the use of three central characters provides. The tone of the narrative does change slightly depending on which of the three is the focus of the chapter with the Leo chapters beingthe most amusingly similar to the way Percy would have told the story. As for the three characters themselves, I liked them all although Leo [along with Festus the dragon] is my favourite. It is interesting watching Jason as he struggles to understand his newfound powers and to adapt his `Roman' view of things into his quest with his Camp Half-Blood friends. While Jason is something of a blank slate, both Piper and Leo are each keeping big secrets that will impact not only on their quest but also on their friendship with each other.<br /><br />Rick Riordan had said in interviews that, even though the Percy Jackson series was finished, there were still Greek myths that he wished he had had a chance to use and it seems that he is going to do so with a flourish in the Heroes of Olympus series. I particularly liked his interpretation of the characters of Medea and Midas in The Lost Hero and his use of lesser known Greek characters such as Boreas. Having the Roman element of the myths playing a role in this new series also allows for the interesting conflicts between the Greek and Roman interpretations of the gods and their duel motivations to be brought out.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 8-year old grand daughter was given this book to read in school recently and to write a report about the story.  She was so taken by the content that she made me want to read it too.  I enjoyed it very much.  Too often people with disabilities or those who are different are judged before other people ever get the chance to find out what truly remarkable individuals they really are.  Well worth the time to read!

Also, as with the &quot;Bubble Witch Saga&quot;  the app keeps trying to get you to pay money to play (which I don't do) I would just rather pay a reasonable price up front, rather than have the makers try to nickel-and-dime me to death.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book.  I have to get some more of her books to read.  When I was finished reading this one, I wanted to write her, meet her to tell her that I have had the same feelings.  I wanted to just leave and run from anything and everything at onetime, also.  I think she is very brave but at times you know she is not. It is something to be learned.  When you have nothing to lose, why be afraid?  She meets all kinds of characters on this journey and meets some real hotties, too.  I think she is trying to find herself if there was ever an \\"herself.\\"  I like the way she describes every detail.  You have to keep reading.  It is spellbinding and captivates you.  You care, wonder, feel, cheer, scared for her, want to help but understand why you shouldn't.  This is the best book that I could relate to.  You wont regret getting this one.  This is her true story somethings changed to protect, I believe.  I want to meet her someday.  She is a special kind of person that only comes around every now and again.

Within 10 minutes one of the plastic tabs<br />in the center of one of the USB ports had snapped off. Although the other ports continued to<br />function, I was now down to a 3 port hub. I posted a pretty negative review the next day.<br /><br />I was contacted right after that by Anker direct and they offered to send me another hub free of<br />charge but by that time I had already ordered another brand (Amazon Basics). They suggested that<br />they send me one anyway to try. I suspect they hoped I would change my mind and my review. I told<br />them that they could do that if they wished and I would re-evaluate the replacement. I can also<br />compare it to the Amazon Basics version.<br /><br />I have not gotten the replacement Anker hub yet (it has been sent) but I think that anyone buying this hub<br />(or any hub, for that matter) should think about something that should have (but did not) occur to<br />me when I first ordered and that is the orientation of the USB ports on the hub.<br /><br />The Anker is a bit different in that when the hub sits flat on a table (common in portable use) the outgoing<br />cables will stick straight up in the air and then go off to the device they are plugged into. This is unlike<br />other hubs (such as the Amazon Basics, for example) where the ports are on the side and would go out parallel<br />to the table and therefore lie flat.<br /><br />I really think that this design is more likely tip over and/or break a port because it allows the cables to pull<br />on the ports much harder because the outgoing cables protrude into the air instead of lying flat where they are<br />supported by the surface the hub is sitting on.<br /><br />I am sure that there are some applications where the user would want the ports in the orientation that Anker<br />has placed them but portable use is probably not one of those uses.<br /><br />The bottom line is that you should think about the position your hub and cables will be in before buying this<br />(or any other) hub and buy whatever design is appropriate for your use.<br /><br />I do at least give Anker lots of credit for excellent customer support.<br /><br />Finally, I received the replacement unit and tested it. It installed easily and worked with every device I tested it with.<br /><br />I have dedicated it to an application where it is permanently installed and the cables can be secured against strain.<br /><br />Bottom line: Great if you need a permanent install of an unpowered hub. Not so great for portable use because of the way the cables<br />  come off the unit. For that reason I am going to stick with 3 stars despite the great customer service.
B009LDD5HW|5.0|I have been a glee fan since the first episode  4 seasons later its still the only show I feel I can go to when im hqving a bad day. I love seeing Lea's character go to new york and follow her dreams. Its hard to believe This is the last season Cory will ever be in.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first 2 books in the trilogy, but this just didn't make sense. There were far too many holes in the logic. I just didn't buy the purity war. And of course the ending. But I didn't see it as tragic, more just a let-down. Honestly I wish I hadn't read it because I would rather remember the series as it was. Of course it was very well written, but just didn't have the dauntless spirit of the others. I felt like the author's heart wasn't in this one. I still want to see the movie though :)
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works as advertised.  Downloads are full sized and crystal clear with excellent audio.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a downloader
B00ET7EON4|5.0|This is a great album full of great sound, writing and originality. Make it a point to see them live as well. They put on a great show.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I decided to get this on blue ray as soon as we saw it at the theater! Watched the extras and loved them, still need to watch the unrated version! Very worthwhile movie to see!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The characters in this book absolutely sucked me in, and by the end I was a weepy mess. It is a beautifully written story that touched my heart and pushed my thinking. Highly recommend it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game. Server slow at times and freezes are often, otherwise would have given a 5 star rating. Enjoy playing
B0060CXSR4|5.0|The movie is great. The story is good. Although I am somewhat concerned that Pocahontas' character came off looking a bit Asian as opposed to Native American.  It's unfortunate that children have to eventually grow up and be exposed to the fact that the indigenous people of this country were eventually slaughtered by the thousands to make way for the industrial age and pollute the Hell out of this beautiful landscape. But that is of no fault to this movie. Well ok maybe every little white lie helps water the truth down just a little bit. But those who made the movie were not guilty of anything. I mean it has Mel Gibson is in it. I don't remember him disparaging Native Americans during his racist rant about committing criminal domestic acts upon the mother of his child.<br /><br />  The process of downloading was very easy. For those with sensitive personalities beware b/c there is a bit of violence. Take an honest look at your child. If little Johnny is already being suspended from 24 month old daycare for beating up other kids and taking their milk away from them  (especially if the other childs mother still has ....ah ..uh.. possession of the ah...uh....Milk), you should steer clear of any movies containing violence, sex, strong language, any gangster movie, any Martin Scorsese film, and any cartoon containing Yosemite Sam.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a very interesting read about life in Pakistan. A real eye opener about the hardships and ways of life in the shadows of the Taliban. This is a remarkable read written by a girl of sixteen!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and its amazing.....with all the details and things it's like your one of the characters!!!! I recommend this to everyone!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|While i am not a big fan of everything that happens, it keeps me reading. I hope there is another book!
B0067R0APK|3.0|The maps do  not display on my Galaxy Tab 2 7&quot;, just blank space. Thumbnail are in the map column. I'm using NBC10 weather to get the google maps with weather layers. This one works but opens on the Philly area. The weather feeds all work fine.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Does not measure up to the other Die Hard movies at all.... Maybe too much action and not enough drama? Also, it seemed like the supporting actors' characters weren't developed at all... It seemed like a total rush job.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice challenge, not to difficult, but just hard enough to make you think . Got got need addicted to the game. Would like to see more floors. Great job...keep them coming!
B00CRVZRUS|4.0|The quality is amazing. Only subtitles in spanish . Still waiting for the let it be movie in bluray. What moré can you say. This are the best group in the world: The Beatles.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This Christmas album did not disappoint! I had heard there were vocals on here and i was a little concerned because I prefer instrumental music over choral music. However, the vocals here do not detract from the instruments. It is a wonderful CD.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This is a good app but there are some pros and cons<br /><br />Pro: it has all utube videos from recent uploads to way old videos<br /><br />Con: Its really glitchy and can cause some bugs
B00G32OER4|5.0|It was a spectacularific movie! I watched it twice in one night! The scares where original, it got right down to the plot and it was interesting.... yes interesting! It gave a realistic insight on demonic and ghostly mythology plus it added some of my favored ghost hunters the warren family. As a person of great horror taste I give this movie a 5 stars for graphics, effects and storyline. Do buy it!
B00846REIS|4.0|I read the fifty shades of grey series and I liked this book better... It was more realistic and had more of a story line.  I just started the second book and am having a hard time putting it down.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great game. not for young kids. very difficult for my six year old. she gets about 15 sec into it and has to start over.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|had the wired version before and really liked it. the wireless version is pretty amazing cause of the freedom to move around and all but has a pretty big deadzone. almost feels like the xbox controller. when i get in intense palm sweating situation those actually do what it meant to do. i have not had any problems with this controller so far so overall its worth buying this peice for those who cant get used to the ps3 duel-shock controller. 5 stars from me
B00CO6QGCE|3.0|Poor, has some great things, and a lot of bad things,<br />1. trying to get shins, goes to blank screen with a circle spinning on the screen and does nothing.<br />2. No instructions.<br />Thank GOD I have an IPAD.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|COOL! Loved the minions and awesome graphics! Totally awesome! Goes off the the movie and characters well and the minions are adorable!!:)
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Okay, ever since Allie announced she was making a book, we have been waiting. The wait was worth it. In her blog post announcing the book, she said that it would be 50% new stuff, and 50% stuff from the blog. Sadly, 'The Scariest Story' and 'The Year Kenny Loggins Ruined Christmas' (my new favorite Christmas story) are not included, but this fact can be overlooked. I was in tears reading this, and am only grateful I wasn't reading it while my family was sleeping, or trying to, anyway.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun and irritating all at the same time. Can't wait to play again, only wish it was more lives.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|this game is beyond belief! unlike any other games I played b4. it really works your mind. 3d is amazing! don't give up-used walkthru once for help but haven't used since. hope this game never ends and there are more like it. great job creators - please have sequels. great game for us babyboomers or anyone wanting to use their minds and be amazed!
B006FPFTMS|5.0|Great program, so much better than Adobe!  Easy to use, similar or more features.  Less hang ups when using with other programs.
B004WR125O|4.0|Bought this for an Onkyo TX-NR515 7.2 unit and this works as described. There are times when the signal drops but not quite sure if that is because of router that is connected to is dropping the signal, the receiver itself and/or this adapter. Since I am not sure, I cannot give this a perfect score in case it is this adapter that is causing the issue.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Terrible, it messed up my device's time and it never rang. I should just stick to my phone's alarm which actually wakes me up
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I liked it... it was another interesting book. I would recommend this book to kids interested in Magic and mythical gods
B0074VTHKM|5.0|It was a different look of how John Grisham writes.  I have only read other aspects.  I enjoyed it very much!

1400052181|5.0|Wonderful, well written piece of history. This story shed light on the HeLa cells as told through a small glimpse inside Henrietta Lacks's family.
0425263908|5.0|This book was so hot and erotic.  This love story of Eva and Gideon  is a unique regarding two people that are truly broken, but get each other. The chemistry between Eva and Gideon is felt through out the the book, and there is a strong pull as a reader wanting them to have their HEA.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|This was a quite enjoyable survey of the events of the summer of 1927. Bryson hopscotches among personalities, stories and developments in a breezy and informative way.This enjoyable read captures the spirit of the time and recaps a season where a lot was happening that helped shape American life and culture for generations. I wholeheartedly recommend this popular history as a fun and informative read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is a beautiful and well developed love story. After reading this book,  I truly fell in love for Gideon Cross. His unconditional love, and protectiveness for Eva at his own selfless expense puts Gideon at the best book boyfriend ever.<br />The purity of their love for each other what makes this book such a great read, and lets not forget the sex.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|It's the big bang theory!!! What else needs said?, we own all the seasons. Most likely you won't need to research this show, consistency funny. If you like one episode, you will like them all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series is such an enjoyment that I don't mind to wait a long time for the next book. In book three, we see that Eva matures and resolves her issues.  Eva is ready and emotionally well equipped to help Gideon with his issues so they can be on their way to their HEA.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book will change your life forever! After reading it I started living wheat free. I've lost weight and inches but the best thing is I'm in control of my life and my health! Thank you Dr. Davis!!!

B000GWE44U|4.0|I love this movie, it's definitely a classic. A great movie for a group on Halloween. There is one awkward scene with 1980's nudity, but we were able to laugh it off with the next scene of a nude corpse.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is amazing!  Love it. The story line is really evolving really nice! You have to watch this show!
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Sometimes when you download a free app you wonder if its going to work. Well this app is great, easy to use and user friendly
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|\\"You're an interesting species; an interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares\\".<br /><br />Those lines from Contact are a movie classic. They really say it all about us.<br /><br />Contact, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made. It is an intelligent science fiction film that makes you think. I have watched it more than a half a dozen times, and  still it never gets old.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Excellent information with studies and facts to back up everything that Dr. Perlmutter shares.  Easy to understand and apply to day-to-day life.  Too significant not to take the time to read.  I have a family history and personal history of many of the issues he addresses.  With Dr. Perlmutter's information, I am finally making the changes I have needed to make my entire life.  A must-read!
B00622D3BS|4.0|Loved it! Great acting, loved the plot, made me laugh out loud many times! Different than most romance chick flicks.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson brings his unique brand of magic to a novella that tries to help his readers appreciate the components and complexity of the human soul; perhaps the most complex design in all creation, and certainly the least understood.  Through the eyes of a Forger, Sanderson blends setting and plot to illustrate endless facets of the human dimension in every character she encounters.  He leads us to discover that within each of us lies a cast of characters, some repressed, and others awaiting a choice or defining moment that steers our course and reshapes who we are and might become.<br /><br />Sanderson fans will love this work and beg for more.  The quality of the characters, plot, and unique setting elements frame this story in much the same way his bestselling Mistborn Trilogy introduced fantasy readers to something fun, fresh, and fast.  You can feel design elements from some of his other works, putting the Sanderson stamp on this excellent, fast-pace novella.  I pray he develops this into the series it begs to become.  A no-questions 5-stars for this pithy gem!<br />Get your copy of The Emperor's Soul today.<br /><br />Tom Clementson (Motley Chronicles)<br /><br />Be sure to take a moment and leave your feedback and comments about the book on Amazon and goodreads.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book is poorly written and full of cliches. Twilight is a badly written book that's addicting and hard to put down. This book is nowhere near that good. It was hard to keep reading.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This set is awesome. I'm so annoyed by all the poor fanboys who complain about the changes made. I like the changes and the prequels. So if your a Star Wars fan or just a movie lover pick these up. If your an obsessed person stay away.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Fast paced action, true to the comic book story. Very good visual effects and sound effects. Pure enjoyment for any age.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The follow up of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; was exhilarating every episode. It kept me interested in the show and I will definitely will watch the third season.

B003VTZSFY|2.0|to disorderly written it goes in different directions and it is difficult to seize the logic, it lacks precision and systematics
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I gave it a four star review because it crashed my kindle once, but overall I love this app and so do the kids I help babysit. It's a good way to pass time and I think it's the same if not better than temple run. I personally like it better but I highly recommend this app. :)
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Play this to relax and unwind. Fun for any age. If you like match 3 games this will not disappoint you.

B0000TAZBK|5.0|I love watching the movies and now I can listen to this great music by Howard Shore while I am working.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|Just kidding; I actually enjoy this movie a lot.<br /><br />Like the \\"most helpful favorable reviewer\\" pointed out, this movie is a mixed bag, a fun fantasy for new kids coming to the Star Trek franchise for the first time, with interesting origins of all the characters die-hard Trekkers have already come to know and love.  The casting of all the leads is perfect.<br /><br />The story is somewhat out of wack with what has come before.  This is no doubt writer/director JJ Abrams' attempt to create an \\"expanded universe\\" or \\"alternate reality\\", his own vision for Star Trek, which is courageous and audacious, to say the least.  He's in effect \\"reinventing the wheel\\", to draw new fans to Star Trek and alienates some old ones.<br /><br />While I'm all for taking some artistic liberties with existing material, I feel the filmmaker needs to feel some sense of duty and responsibility to honor that which has \\"boldly gone where no one has gone before\\".  The origins of the characters are great, but Vulcan destroyed?  That's not in line with the original Trek.<br /><br />Still, this new Star Trek is an entertaining, fun thrill-ride, and I'm just delighted that Paramount is revitalizing Trek AT ALL!  If nothing else, this new version of Trek and its eventual franchise will stimulate kids to go back and watch the original Trek series and movies, which is great.  This is why I among other die-hard Trekkers can't be too upset about this new version of Trek.
B0033AI4MA|5.0|The movie when I knew that Meryl Streep would ultimately be the greatest actress of all time.  Her previous films mere all exceptional work.  But Sophie's Choice was just so stunning.  Every skill of Meryl's dramatic roles was displayed as Sophie.  And she was so young when she made the film.  Her ability to reach to the depths of Sophie's desperate pain, and utter guilt about her \\"choice\\" and her father's Nazi collaboration and complicity was remarkable.  Her accent was so perfect and the walk she learned to move through the mud at Auschwitz.  She was doing the Auschwitz walk.  As a Jewish person, this film and the role of Sophie opened my mind to the suffering of others, non-Jews.  I can never forget this film.  I absolutely fell in love with Meryl Streep with Sophie's Choice.  I so look forward to a BluRay version, which seems to not yet be available.  There are many fine actors.  But Meryl Streep is in a class all by herself-she is the \\"gold standard\\" of acting, the one all actors hope one day to work with, the one all directors know will each time give the best performance for the film at hand.
B001ECDVKE|3.0|Well.  I love the music.  The Martians are well designed.  The movie soars whenever they’re onscreen.  Unfortunately, they aren’t onscreen nearly enough.  In fact, it takes about a half hour before they finally show up.  In the meantime, we’re mistreated to a slew of introductions to the entire cast, mugging shamelessly, as they sally forth on various campaigns of nonsense.  The problem with satirization is most people forget that the source material was earnest in their attempts; they weren’t trying to produce something awful.  Just acting goofy for the sake of goofiness isn’t the same thing.  Half the time I couldn’t tell who or what Burton was satirizing, his approach was so broad, at times desperate, to make fun of something, anything.  In the end, this film isn’t funny or fun enough, often enough, to be truly satisfying.  And yet, ever few years, I will watch it again...........and think the same thing.  This is not one of Burton’s best efforts.  A hodgepodge of brain-dead characters in search of a story.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is my first venture at writing a review, but I really enjoyed this book so I thought I would give it a try.  Please forgive my amateurish missteps that are sure to be readily apparent.  I read for pleasure and escapism, and this book is escapism in its purest form.  Not since Anne Rice's The Witching Hour, have I stayed up all night to read a book about witches.<br /><br />I was captivated by this book from the first pages wherein a historical alchemical manuscript seemed to be mysteriously drawn to Diana Bishop, the last of the powerful Bishop witches, even though she was basically powerless and had mostly turned her back on witchery years ago in favor of a \\"normal\\" human life.  Diana was an outsider by choice and didn't participate in Wiccan holidays, so when she was discovered in the library by the mesmerizing Professor Clairmont, there were no other witches around to protect her from this powerful vampire, a sworn enemy of her species.<br /><br />The following day Diana just wants to continue her research, but there are witches, daemons and vampires everywhere.  As the book unfolds, you begin to wonder just who Diana's real enemies are and if it is possible for a Diana to trust, and possibly love, a vampire.<br /><br />Harkness' prowess as a highly regarded professor of history at USC definitely shines through in this book.  Bottomline, a great read.  When I finished this book, I immediately started Shadow of the Night, the second book in this trilogy.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is really fun.  When I first downloaded it I didn't imagine that I would like it but it is amazing
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love Ellen and I was happy to know a little bit more about her personal life.  I just didn't move through the book very quickly.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|When The Suburbs was released, I tried my very best not to like it. I loved Funeral and Neon Bible but somehow felt I was tired of Arcade Fire's lack of humor and possible insincerity. Though The Suburbs had a few duds, I couldn't help but think it was terrific as a whole.<br /><br />Here we are again. Reflektor has arrived and though I tried not to get excited and initially wrote it off because the leader of the overrated LCD Soundsystem was involved, I can't help but absolutely adore it. No other album makes me shake the way Reflektor does. It digs its fingernails into a primitive nerve and tells it that it has no other choice but to squirm. Uncomfortably. Joyfully.<br /><br />Lyrically, this resonates far more than any album in recent memory. &#34;Here Comes the Night Time&#34; perfectly destroys Christianity and its evil insistence on converting non-believers. The martyrdom of &#34;Joan of Arc&#34; (&#34;First they love you, then they kill you, then they love you again&#34;) brings Michael Jackson to mind. Even the songs that appear to be juvenile on the surface (&#34;Normal Person&#34; and &#34;You Already Know&#34;) have brilliant lines. &#34;You dream in English now, in proper English, look how you're just the same as me&#34; and &#34;If you stop to ask, it's already passed. So how can you move so slow?&#34; Which reminds me of my lifelong nagging query... how do people who stand on escalators get anything done?<br /><br />Despite it's extended duration, Reflektor sounds far more cohesive than your average album. There are so many things I think and feel about it that I can't possibly form into a review. I'll just let it speak for itself.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Love this movie! This is the movie we watch almost every other day during December and finally updated it to blu ray. Elf is great for all ages and the story line is easy to follow along.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Thor was an action movie that stays true to its Norse mythology roots while telling an interesting story. The acting was excellent and the lead characters were believable in their roles. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Predictable but still funny.  Repeats many of the same themes and jokes, but still worth the $5 dollars.  Leaves it open for another one.
B0068RQ85K|5.0|I only wish I had found this sooner!  It's a major time saver and it's made my life so much easier and painless making these coils for jump rings!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The sheer amount of alcohol that it took for me to suspend my belief through the first two books put my local liquor store owner's kids through undergrad. However, the little tykes now have clinched a secure future in Medicine, or PhD's in Rocket Science from the Ivy League of their choice with this final book. Though despite what you may think 90% of my generous donation has nothing to do with what happened to Tris Prior. And because I’m probably slightly tipsy, there will likely be spoilers below, so please do keep that in mind if you read this review further.<br /><br />It took about a fifth of gin for my mind to let slide the lightning quick progression of the character, who wouldn’t make a five year old nervous, to making Chuck Norris check under his bed at night for Beatrice Prior in the space of about a week. When her mother came to visit her at Dauntless, she was a completely different person after just a couple of days. She became a marksman to rival a WWII German Sniper after just one class, and somehow managed to become a skilled hand to hand combatant after fighting about three or four other unskilled combatants and no physical training. Also, despite the fact that the Dauntless are supposed to be fearless, the Erudite are supposed to always seek more information, and the Candor are in pursuit of the truth, it seems a complete suspension of belief that there was never a mass movement to check out the surrounding area, or even find out if there ever was anything. The Dauntless are afraid of the fence but can jump off a moving train? A bunch of scientists who have no interest in the rest the world (Darwin would roll over in his grave)? The Candor not interested in the truth outside? I can overlook these because 99 Bananas is extremely potent, however the hangover it required to get past them was almost not worth the otherwise entertaining premise.<br /><br />Now, onto Allegiant specifically. The entire book’s premise completely insulted anyone with an ounce of intelligence or sobriety. Bringing down David and the people at the compound makes absolutely no sense. No one in the main government was aware of the experiment’s current purpose and planning? Someone was David’s boss. He wasn’t funding the project with bubblegum sales to the surrounding slums. Plus every single person was working there when they wiped the memories? Everyone? No one was on vacation in Disney World with the grandkids? Stay with me here (I’ll buy you a drink later if you do, provided you’re of age), imagine that the CIA’s memory was wiped by a terrorist group. You think the government is going to negotiate with them after that? Not to mention that Evelyn is supposed to be some evil mastermind, a woman whose entire being was tempered by a man who beat her within an inch of her life for years, and she gives up her whole crusade after less than five seconds of consideration, because Tobias asked her to? We aren’t talking about giving up a subscription to Vogue. We’re talking about abandoning an emerging nation.<br /><br />Second, Ms. Roth does not know how to write the point of view of man. Or at the very least, she does not know how to write a point of view that’s different from her main character. Tobias and Tris’ voices were identical. Like other’s I had to put down my glass of wine and scroll back to figure out who was talking. Call me sexist, but I lost a little respect for Tobias for sounding like a chick. I want a man to sound like a man. No, he doesn’t have to be grunting “Bacon” and “Beer”, but is probably the most verbally emotional guy I’ve ever seen over the age of 16.<br /><br />Last thing I’ll rant about (because the liquor store closes at 8 and I’m still not over this ending) will be what most people are upset about, and is actually the least of my concerns—Tris’ death. Sudden, ill-contrived, completely pointless, and leaves too many things unsettled. If you’re going to do something like this, at least build it up better. I’m all for Author’s killing off their characters. The characters are theirs, make it a Hamlet ending if you want—have a Rambo moment, I don’t care. But the buildup for her death was probably about 20 pages of. It feels like Ms. Roth didn’t know how she wanted to end it, and then thought “Oh I’ll make this about selflessness and show how Tris is selfless” which the book has not successfully put forth as a major theme. Sure, she talked about it from time to time, but she went off on too many other tangents. She built up the genetic damage side and then, for some reason, decided that’s not going to even matter in the last chapters of the book. Tris’ death was obscure and meaningless, because it didn’t even make sense (see my point about vacations to Disney World). Pick a theme, stick with it, make it clear without bottling it and cracking people over the head with it, and don’t confuse my rum-addled brain with flip flopping.<br /><br />Up until Allegiant, I really did like this series. I read all three in a few weeks. But the last book had no redeeming value, after all the leeway I gave Ms. Roth on her other terrible plot holes. At least the author can rest easy that the owner of my local liquor store, his children, and Cupcake Winery thank Ms. Roth for writing the book.
B003QSLDTA|5.0|The movie was awesome I just wish you did not need and app on the ipad to watch it but either than that I loved the movie I would recommend it to tweens or teens
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Omg I love this game like family wow!!! So fun I play it all day when I wake up to  the afternoon!!!!! Pay I no it is almost 3 dollars but still get it!!!!!!!!!
1936891026|5.0|Why didn't it let me rate it as good. Was able to share it with a grandson who is starting to realize the universe is showing his resistance to believing in himself. He is posting some of the lesson at work,to keep him in the arena and understanding the hard knocks will come but to be aware it is the universe showing him how he is believing in himself and to overcome that resistance to know he can let the knocks come and learn from them and not let them put him down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The words of this book so accurately describe some of the truths found in this life Such wisdom is frequently cultivated in people facing illness, physical ailments or terminal illness, in my experience. I won't say it is representative of every life story or experience, but as a sliver of life in the characters, it rings true.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I loved the suspense of the story. I felt like I was there.<br />I have recommended this novel. I' m hooked!!!
1476727651|4.0|I was a little nervous about this one, since it is a &#34;sequel&#34; to The Shining (one of Stephen King's most successful efforts).  Mr. King apparently shared that feeling, because the novel gave every indication of having received special attention.  I expect that this will ultimately be filmed, either as a movie or a television special.  When it is, I'd love to see Kathy Bates in the role of the chief villainess.  It seemed to me that King developed the character with her in mind.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game, it's so addictive &amp; fun to play!  Anyone can enjoy, it's simple enough for kids to adults,  but once you start playing, it's hard to stop!!!
B0000CF30C|4.0|Nice and clean, though the title cut (Toys in the Attic) seems a little muddy and not mastered as well.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I enjoyed Scott's description of his trials and tribulations in life. His life events are not much different than anyone else, except for context. A look at how much effort one puts forward toward a goal only to recognize they have long lost the reason for why and what they do. I greatly enjoy the recipes included at the end of each chapter and can't wait to try them all. A good read for anyone, a great read for those who need to recapture the joy and simplicity of running..........
B00064X3FE|4.0|Well recorded and good writing. Bought the remastered CD and it's very clean with great separation. All of Elton Johns remastered CD's are great sounding.
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|While not as good as the book, the movie does it justice.<br /><br />I hope they come out with an extended version!
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|Unreliable, frequent disconnects and an inelegant integration (reported battery level) with the iMac.  Oddly weighted vis-&agrave;-vis regular batteries.<br /><br />Product questions sent to Mobee via the web site were not answered other than an automated email.<br /><br />Returned for a refund.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Extremely pertinent to todays she are the best I've heard and mirror the shennanigans in Congress.  The production is superb,and the visuals and sound are the best I,ve heard.
B0089LOG02|4.0|It is both a compelling and heart wrenching story. We feel so much compassion for the main character and the injustices that life can throw at the vulnerable ones.The story takes many twists and turns and despite the hardships she faces, her character is molded and influenced by the traumatic experiences she endures. This helps to make her the strong, determined and the exceptional person she becomes. The story keeps you totally involved and anticipating what will happen next. You will cheer for her on every page!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|It was an interesting book and I enjoyed it but the plot had a bit too many story lines to follow. If I did not have the time to read for a couple of days, I had to go back in the story to remember exactly what was happening. I do not enjoy that much drama in a story.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Very fun but gets boring don't get It I liked it but don't waste your storage on your device bye.
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|This book starts out very strong, drawing the reader in with the retelling of the shooting. The bulk of the book is mired in the politics and take over of Pakistan by the Taliban. I quickly lost interest, skipping entire sections to get back to the story of this remarkable girl's recovery and journey following the terrible incident.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Wow, wish I had read this comic in its infancy oh well great read..highly recommend, even to the ladies out there, is about relationships... pretty rad. Thumbs up.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|Too much violence for a children's book.  The story line was plodding at times and very repetitive.  Some cute ideas and some rather inane ones.  So glad they only used the characters and a few ideas from the book when they made the movie.  If the movie had followed this book it would have never become a classic.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Compelling and fast-paced...a page-turner.  Keeps u guessing til the very end!!!  Doesn't feel formulaic.  Can't wait til more of his books r translated.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app!! I have made tons of cool stuff on here and I can't wait to make more. It is the best!!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|But a little sad at the ending.😥 Couldn't put the book(s) down. I'm 44, not really age group this was written for - but I absolutely loved the entire series!
B00BXDOSXS|1.0|I'm relatively tech-challenged and just wanted Adobe Flash Player app for my new Kindle Fire HD which apparently is not available...yet?!  Thought this was an alternative app and it just might be but there is no Help or Feature screen to assist the user in knowing what to do.  It opens to a blank screen with alphabetical listing on side.  I got that apparently videos are stored in this order to view when you want but I just want to view Facebook videos that friends post which state &quot;need Adobe Flash Player&quot;.  Am I supposed to download their video to Kindle then upload to this app?  Who has time to do that?!  Scrolling FB and quick video view along the way is the norm.  Even my Droid phone has Adobe Flash Player.  Really need the app for Kindle because this app is not what I thought it was, and if this is an alternative, it really need some type of instruction.
0307010856|5.0|I have 2nd graders who fight over who gets this in their book box.  A great way for kids to practice expressive reading.  You will have as much fun as they do during a read aloud.  A great interactive book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this game is so AWSOME I downloaded the game and I couldn't getaway. My kindle has to be on the charger all the time. I feel like this game is the best game I played yet. I highly recommend you get this game.
B0019CB5T8|5.0|One of the best faith based stories based on real evidence that the devil exists! 1 of my all time favorites!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|The greatest series only to be cancelled before it's prime!  It will leave you wanting more.  One season is just way too short for this wonderful series.
B0095R3D0I|5.0|Love this movie! I've watched since my kids were little. The copy had was bad but Amazon fixed my dilemma quickly with the download, Thanks!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It felt like a never ending LONG tedious reading!<br />I really don't understand the writter. She could have given us so much more! But instead she gave us this tedious-lack of action & emotion story with a disappointing ending. NOTHING like the first book.<br />I just feel sad for such a poor ending to these characters I used to love!<br />Four was another person in this book. Not the strong character we thought would lead an important revolution in Divergent. Of course he had some issues but with Tris he could overcome anything, right? Wrong! He was just a pity shadow of 1st book Four.<br />Wow! So many things to say about this poor plot (none of them good). I'm just going to keep it simple & with no spoilers. In one word: BAD!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have read this book multiple times and it's still one of my favorites. I enjoy reading about ancient Japanese history; bushido, customs, & beliefs.  This is a long book & saga, but it is one to enjoy & savor
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Have to give this 5 stars for Demons and Radioactive. The other songs...not so great, but cannot fault the entire album. This group has talent they need to delve deeper into as they did with above mentioned songs and not be too &#34;pop-y&#34;
B004VMUS9G|5.0|nice app this wakes me up all the mornings := i like it, it sound very hard so it helps me to wake up (I am a person that works a lot at night and cant sleep so much so i need something that helps me to track my sleeping hours).
B00004VOZG|5.0|Must have album like every Zep one, specially the first 6 records. This special edition comes down to almost exactly what the original LP release was. It is the definitive one
B008JFUR10|5.0|It's giant robots fighting giant monsters.  I mean.. what's not to like?  Watch this movie on the biggest screen you have with the surround sound cranked up.
B000002UA9|5.0|The greatest debut of all time, by the greatest band of all time in its original form. The quickest album ever recorded I think. Favourite from back to back. A great door-opener and the way to start if you are new to the Beatles
B0008ENHUI|5.0|This movie is awesome and definitely stands the test of time.  McQueen and Hoffman are both great in it.  I wasn't even born when this film came out, but I heard it was good by a few people so I rented it.  I loved it.  So I bought it.
0525478817|5.0|It is such an amazing story! You will fall in love with the characters, the love story is so captivating and sad! I can't wait for the movie to come out I hope its close to how good the book is! Do not wait to see the movie first the book is so worth reading!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Get was great! The kids loved it. Just what they have waiting for the blue ray to come out. Arrived on time, loved it.
B000WCDBKM|1.0|Initially I wondered why I had never even heard of this movie.  Then I realized it's because this movie seriously sucks.  If you're looking for an interesting story I suggest you look elsewhere.  With some terrible action sequences and a pretty lame plot you'll find yourself wondering how much longer you're going to watch this stupid thing only to find yourself too far to stop hoping something worthwhile will happen towards the end, but no.  The movie's end sequence is truly the poop icing on a turd cake which is this film.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wow, I have to say that he is still the &#34;King&#34; of suspense.  If you ever wondered what happened to the little boy from the Shining then you will love this novel.  I could hardly put it down and was very sorry when it ended.  Awesomely good read!
B00D2MC8WG|3.0|Nietzsche's Also Sprach Zarathurstra is less a philosophical treatise and more like dynamite. Its impact is seismic. It's akin (in the very least) to Martin Luther nailing his 95 theses to the door of the Castle-Church in Wittenberg. Witness the following:<br /><br />\\"I teach you the Superman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the Superman: a laughing-stock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape. . . . Behold, I teach you the Superman! The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the Superman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!\\"<br /><br />This is the re-evaluation of all values, top to bottom. Surely it warrants tension in the act of delivery, even if the message be transmitted through Richard Strauss?<br /><br />For all the incidental beauties of the Berlin Philharmonic, that's what I find missing here in the Dude's performance: tension - namely, a deep-set awareness that this manifesto is dangerous and for better or worse, it's going to change the world forever.<br /><br />Karajan '73 delivers it in spades. For instance, listen to the closing chords of the first movement in the leading up to the fortissimo: the Berlin Phil of yesteryear bets the house; its latter-day namesake plays very stylishly and that's about it.<br /><br />It makes me wonder to what extent the Dude is conversant with Nietzsche (to say nothing of the current members of the orchestra). That being said, I hear a similar lack of tension in Rattle's Ein Heldenleben. Its reoccurrence makes me wonder if absolution should be granted to Sir Simon; perhaps the flaw lies within the DNA of the current Berlin Philharmonic. Stylish obbligato contributions from this principal or that are no substitute for the Furor Teutonicus of yesteryear.<br /><br />If the duel between Karajan and Dudamel were occurring in the same weight-division - the prize-fight in Don Juan and Til Eulenspeigel would be more even than what they are.  As things stand, the Dude offers well-manicured, lightweight readings which do not bespeak longevity. It's a KO to Herbie.<br /><br />As such, I am aligned with Stewart on this one.<br /><br />Time will tell.onder to what extent the Dude is conversant with Nietzsche (to say nothing of the current members of the orchestra).

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun and a good time killer. However some of the games are a little too easy. It also takes a while building up the points to unlock the next game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Lots of emotions, laughs, cries, etc. Realistic characters, interesting story, loved the smooth ending and epilogue.<br />I recommend this book of you want a drama
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|It's my second use this device at the pool and it has broken down. The water leaks inside of it. But someone called it underwater mp3 player then it become!  Actually i've been waiting for better performance. Does it worth to pay this price just using it once? These companies must be kidding. Doesn't someone ever try the product on his own? Are the customers bunch of people who is of no use except making you money for nothing? You make me feel like...Thanks for that.
1936891026|5.0|This books came to me at the right time and place.  I was feeling unreasonably angry and dissatisfied and couldn't put my finger on the reason why.  This book helped me recognize RESISTANCE which is at its root nothing but fear.  Once I recognized what I was feeling for what it really was (through this book) I let go of the fear and I now feel free and happier than I have in a long time.  My friends and I talk about this alot and we have all been able to see resistance when it rears it's ugly head.  I say ugly because it does nothing for you, only chains you to bad behaviors which cripples you.  Resistance has nothing to do with art, although I can see why this book was written from Mr. Pressfield's point of view (as a writer).  We ALL encounter resistance in our lives and if you can recognize it for what it is and send it on it's way you will be much happier for it.  I encourage all who are seeking to become better human beings to read this book as part of your arsenal for spiritual growth.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an awesome game, some of the levels are difficult and take some time to beat but still very addictive. I love it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love being able to check my yahoo account from anywhere there is WiFi.  Only drawback is that I can't read the full screen and having trouble figuring out to return an email.  That could be my fault for not being so techy.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I would read this book more than once great story<br />I look forward to reading more of her books in the future
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Very similar to MIB. Funny in spots with over the top fantasy action. Easy watching movie. good cast of actors.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and I have been waiting for it to come to the app store for the longest time
B00F91H666|5.0|Better then I expected. Good action and actors. Would recommend. great zombie movie with lots of action and handsome Brad Pitt
0385537131|2.0|To be honest, I only made it halfway through the book because I found it so boring and the author's writing so distractingly obnoxious. The author seems to have so much contempt for all of his characters, except the main one, who is portrayed as a saintly martyr. I can understand expressing a little contempt towards the bigoted family of the deceased, but Grisham spreads it all around, especially to the female characters. The main character has to \\"dumb down\\" his explanation of the will to the housekeeper, the main beneficiary of the will. A secretary that he meets is gratuitously described as having \\"the unmistakable look of a woman who was fast and loose.\\" Poor secretary, what did she ever do but show up as a minor character in a Grisham novel? And she gets called \\"fast and loose\\" and later \\"a tart\\"? But not everyone reads from a feminist perspective like I do, so here's a more general criticism: All of the characters are stereotypes. The fast talking Black lawyer who's only there for the publicity and can't stop pontificating even when it lands him in prison on contempt charges. The Southern white bigots who can't even muster up the slightest civility to a black housekeeper, even before they know she's going to be getting the fortune they believe should be theirs. The low-down dirty dog of a husband. The disbarred lawyer who drinks too much but yearns to rejoin the legal world and fight for justice. I don't know. Maybe I expected too much. I guess if this is your \\"type\\" of book, you'll like it, and if you enjoy really elegant, compelling prose with multidimensional characters you'll roll your eyes halfway through and go read something else.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I love these and for the price you couldn't ask for more, I use these for work doing simultaneous translation and haven't had a single complaint.
B0030B624E|3.0|Not a blockbuster but very well done.  Not the typical B grade zombie movie...  It's very funny, Bill Murray visit is hilarious.  It's worth a watch
0743270754|5.0|Gives insight into the character  and motives of  many of the politicians during Lincoln's time and how he &#34;used&#34; them.  Heavy reading at times, but is filled with little known interesting facts about the Lincoln era.
