B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This BBC series stands the test of time and then some.  I've watched it several times now and it seems as though each time I enjoy it more. Netflix did a recent adaptation of the book/BBC show but it was too \\"American\\"; too heavy handed and a bit of an insult to the original sharp wit and brilliant timing.  I can't recommend the original BBC version of House of cards highly enough.<br /><br />Sprague Theobald<br />[[ASIN:1616086238 The Other Side of the Ice: One Family's Treacherous Journey Negotiating the Northwest Passage]]

B000U0F7RG|5.0|People who know me will be surprised to learn that I thoroughly enjoyed the Gilmore Girls.  After all, there are no guns--even though Lorelai tells Rory to take a Glock to Yale--and it's often about the romantic entanglements of a mother and daughter.  But the dialogue is as witty as you'd expect from something called Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions, and Lauren Graham is beguilingly cute as Lorelai.  And there's Edward Herrmann as Lorelai's father, who comes off as a gruff executive at first, but turns out to be just as charming in his craziness as his daughter.  The rest of the characters in Stars Hollow are as eccentric and complicated as they should be.  Then there's Luke--I rooted for him to win the affections of Lorelai for seven seasons.<br /><br />Review by the author of [[ASIN:0983687242 A Draft of Moonlight]]
B00B10HAO2|4.0|'Hitchcock', the film, was a great surprise. It did not seem like a film, I would enjoy, but the actors, Anthony Hopkns ( who by the way, bears a remarkablee likeness in speech, walk, actions and looks ) and Helen Mirren as his wife, Alma.<br /><br />What we have in this film, is the personal side of life of Hitchcock and his wife. At one point Alma tells someone that Hitch worked for her, she was the boss. She is, in fact, the unheralded writer and fixer of his scripts. She was beautiful and sexy, and, even though it appears their marriage had grown sexless, they were devoted to each other.<br /><br />The film is also about the making of films in the 'old' days of the studio systems of x-rating and looking at every aspect of the film. Hitchcock was having a dry period in filming, and found a script he liked about a serial killer, which turned into 'Pyscho'. The studio hated the idea, Alma found the subject gross, but Hitchcok was adamant. He had to mortgage their belived home and pool. It says a great deal that Alma agreed to this. Her home was truly her castle. The making of the film and the underlying pinnings of Hitchcock's attractions to his lady stars, is a large part of this film. We are also left to wonder if Alma went astray from time to time.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren turn in extraordinary performances. I liked this film a great deal<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-22-13

B00005JKBC|4.0|I happened on to this film on a rainy, dreary day. It turned out to be a good film, all because of Robert Redford.<br /><br />Robert Redford, plays Nathan Muir, as a CIA spy.  we see him in the last 24 hours of his last day at work.  Brad Pitt, plays Tom Bishop, as a young recruit. Catherine McCormack, plays Hadley, a love interest of Bishop. She was sent to China on a top secret mission, and when trouble developed, Bishop was sent to save her. All of this in a 25 year time span, and we see the past in flash backs, partly while Muir is being questioned by the CIA hierarchy.  All the while Muir has been acting to get both Bishop and Hadley back, against the CIA's orders. As his last day takes place, we see how this develops and how his leaders really know nothing about him. All they think they know is wrong.<br /><br />This is an action film, but much of it is head games. Redford as Muir is the film. Just when the powers that be, think they have the man, they are proved wrong, and it is the cunning of this man Muir, acted by Redford, that saves the film.<br />It kept me hooked.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 09-22-13
9889979942|4.0|A departure from my normal reading, I picked up this \\"little big\\" book after a quick holiday in China, where unfortunately I was relegated to tourist sites rather than the more interesting (but off-limits) hinterlands like the photographer of this book had access to. The compact cube size makes it unique as a piece of memorabilia rather than some obtrusive coffee table book, but even after several weeks I still have not finished pouring through all 800+ pictures. Ideal and inspirational as a gift for someone going to China, or treat yourself to visually glorious insight into this mysterious culture.

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan from way back.  I've enjoyed the 1960's television series, all the movies that starred Shatner, Nimoy and that bunch, the 'Next Generation' tv series and movies.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the way the reboot has been handled and love the way we get to see both what is familiar (our beloved original characters albeit in new ways) and what is not (Kahn being portrayed as a member of the federation).  JJ Abrams was definitely the one to bring the reboot to the big screen.  I hope we get to enjoy more of these innovative films for years to come!
B000UJ48U4|5.0|I know a lot of Stanley Kubrick fans who do not like this movie, but I really enjoyed it. I love all that conspiracy stuff and this movie took all the conspiracy stuff to the max. I also liked all the bonus material in this two-disc set.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|At first, I was skeptical. About all of the positive reviews this book had received. Charlie cries a lot and it gets a little irritating. I'm used to strong characters as protagonists, with fixed minds and ideas. Charlie has more of a quiet strength and throughout the book (his letters) you can see the transformation he undergoes. His coming of age, if you will. As he slowly progresses to being coming a young adult with all of the struggles and relationships that that entails he never changes. He's always honest, he's always optimistic, and he's there for whoever needs him. This book deals with the usual YA topics such as drug use, the development of relationships (both platonic and otherwise), parent-child dynamics, and even heavier ones like sexual child abuse and homosexuality (&#34;coming out&#34;). It portrays it for what it is. The confusions, the heartbreak, the struggle to come to terms with them, and how they define you as a person. Personally, I'd recommend this book because it, through Charlie's perspective, holds no judgement for any situation. It just encourages you to look at the bright side and and not left circumstances define you a person. The best way I can put it is through Charlie's own words: “So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.”

B000X9325I|5.0|The sound from this 1937 Salzburg performance derives from selenophone tapes.  If you cannot get past the sound, you will be deprived of the best performance ever.  I suggest you listen to audio links to get an idea of the sound.<br /><br />As to the performance, Toscanini worked with top singers who seem to live their roles.  The approach is highly individual.  The Queen of the Night's coloratura runs don't sound it.  They sound fiery and dramatic, which I find to be just perfect - like a glimpse into Mozart's mind.  Papageno's aria is delivered with an elan that makes other versions sound lifeless.  Sarastro's Oh Isis und Osiris is delivered by Alexander Kipnis with superhuman slowness and breadth.<br /><br />The second act opens with the march played with superhuman solemnity and poetry.  Ah Ich Fuhls is delivered at a faster than usual tempo that varies with the drama of Pamina's heartbreak.  The coda is fast and angry and sad and magical.  Papageno's suicide attempt is HEARTBREAKING.  The wrap up of the opera is magical.  As you might expect, tempos are mostly swift, though some are very slow.  For passion, breadth, and even comedy (in the spoken dialogue), there is nothing like it.  Despite the sound, if I could own only one Magic Flute, this would be it.  Toscanini sure understands Mozart.<br /><br />Other performances exist.  I would recommend Norrington, or (if you don't mind lack of spoken dialogue) the Klemperer (for a more traditional romantic approach, and also the unique pioneering Beecham (also without spoken dialogue).<br /><br />There is a filler.  It is Toscanini's finest Mozart 40th.  It is from 1953 with good sound.  The approach includes a slow movement  more beautifully phrased than the 1950 studio account.  The outer movements are less variable in tempo.  It is a pity that this account was not the one commercially released.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|I don't know much about what went into the making of \\"World War Z\\", except for snippets of things I heard or read, such as Brad Pitt fighting for the rights to make it and the subsequent problems during production.  I HAVE read the EXCELLENT book \\"World War Z\\" by Max Brooks, but sadly, the title is the only thing the two have in common.  Yes, I know both deal with a \\"Zombie\\" outbreak on a worldwide scale, but seriously, Brad Pitt could have made his film into a Zombie Rom-Com and probably made the same money, simply because of his name.<br /><br />As I read The Max Brooks novel, I could picture in my mind exactly what a film version would look like.  There's nothing wrong with jumping from character to character and location to location in a film, if it all follows a main plot and theme.  Who cares if there isn't a central character as Pitt's Gerry Lane was?  In the novel, the \\"main character\\" was the one who interviewed all other characters years after the war, and he was the least interesting person in the book.  A film following the separate stories of the characters in the book would have been MUCH better.  Imagine a scene from the soldier's point of view at the Battle of Yonkers. Imagine a scene about the underwater diver and how the Zekes still walk and attack hundreds of meters below on the ocean floor... that scene alone would be nail-biting enough to make a true horror movie.  Imagine a scene about the downed female pilot and her journey thru the Zekes guided by the mysterious voice on her radio.  Imagine a scene where the geeky recluse Japanese teen tries to escape his high-rise hell and later becomes a sort of Zombie killing samurai.  And then imagine the turning point of the war when we learn how to fight back?  This and DOZENS of other scenes from the book would have been so much better then following the one character of Lane and not really caring about his family on the ship, and especially the little boy they \\"adopted\\" along the way.  That was all just family friendly \\"fluff\\"...not needed in the true World War Z experience.  Seemed to me some producer or casting agent really wanted to get their daughters into a Hollywood feature film...thats all that was.  Gerry Lane could have been a bachelor and it would have made no difference in the film.<br /><br />I did enjoy certain aspects of the film as it stood on its own which is why I gave it three stars, and was sort of glad it offered a different take on a Zombie War, but I am saddened that it strayed SO far from the source material.  I know a lot of ignorant people that never read, or have no idea that films can be based on books.  They always seem to think the book is based on the movie they saw...they confuse original literary work with a \\"Novelization of the film\\". So its my fear that people will see the movie and have no idea the book is SO much better and deserves a lot more credit then simply lending its name to the Brad Pitt film.<br /><br />This movie should prove as a warning to the team that takes on Justin Cronin's \\"The Passage\\", one of the most brilliant and compelling books of all time.  I've heard talk of it being made into a movie, so I hope they realize that they shouldn't reinvent the wheel as Pitt's team did on \\"World War Z\\".  \\"Z\\" could have been shot scene for scene from the original book and be a HUGE blockbusters, and so could \\"Passage\\".  I know \\"The Passage\\" is long, but who cares?  A man like Peter Jackson doesn't seem to care about film length, and his success with LOTR proves audiences don't care either.  Longer the better!<br /><br />As for the Unrated Blu-Ray release itself, I was a little saddened by how bare bones the \\"extras\\" were.  I mean, this was billed as the MOST EXPENSIVE ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER MADE and yet there were only a couple extras features.  I have a 2007 Collector's Edition release of the 1984 \\"Return of the Living Dead\\", and they have MUCH better extras.  I guess I just expected a little more from the Blu-ray release of the movie that was supposed to be so groundbreaking in the Zombie canon.  Remember how secretive they were about not even SHOWING the zombies before it hit theaters?  A few extras on the creation of the zombies would have been nice...sort of like what they do on \\"Walking Dead\\" season releases.  And finally, some interviews with Max Brooks himself would have been priceless!<br /><br />Thank you for reading.

030789701X|4.0|TL;DR - the content is carefully arranged, comprehensive, and mostly easy to find. However, if you are a Skyrim fan who ALSO happens to value well-constructed tomes, you are likely to be a bit disappointed.<br /><br />And make no mistake: this IS a tome - exceeding eleven hundred pages. I love books, and I love Skyrim. In a perfect world, I would want a clothbound hardcover edition that marries these two passions.<br /><br />Instead, this volume is printed on magazine stock with glossy paper covers pasted over boards. In its construction, it more closely resembles a high school text book than a cloth-bound hardcover edition. I'd have gladly paid an additional $10-15 for a cloth-bound volume with sturdier pages - not magazine print, but I expect that I am in the minority.<br /><br />BUT! Magazine print packs a lot of lore and game information in a much more compacted space, and in this regard, the book does not fail.<br /><br />Skyrim fans will be ecstatic. Bibliophiles (who also happen to be Skyrim fans) will be merely pleased. For myself, I am glad I bought it, and would do it again if a more carefully constructed volume comes on offer.

B005LAIIMG|3.0|World War Z is a mediocre film at best. Brad Pitt is a former U.N. inspector who somehow becomes the answer to a zombie epidemic. We are left to believe that Pitt was so good at his job that the U.N. brought him out of retirement. This must be true because all others failed to demonstrate the ability to survive and adapt as well as him, even Navy SEALS. With people dropping like flies and sprinting zombies swarming everywhere, Pitt is able to stop and observe details that no one else can observe.<br /><br />All gore is avoided. The camera pans this way and that to allow us to be saved from seeing anything bloody. Perhaps this was the main way of keeping a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />There is plenty of action. It is all just so fast that it is really impossible to get any tension from the audience. By the time the terror appears, it is quickly passed us. For the scenes that are not too fast, they are too dark. Not being able to see what is going on does not make it scary while you are sitting in your living room.<br /><br />The military tactics utilized in this book are pathetic. This is another example of Hollywood either using bad choices of experts or not listening to them at all.<br /><br />As for the book, this films shares two similarities; the title and the fact that it contains zombies. Beyond that, don't look for any of the genius Max Brooks wrote in his zombie fiction.<br /><br />Anyway, there are worse zombie films out there. There are quite a few, actually. On the side of the films that are worse than this one, they had nowhere near the budget of this film and did not soil the name of an excellent book for the most part.<br /><br />This one can be skipped, although zombie completists have no choice but to give it a go.

0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis has a way of breaking down financial industries so a layman can not only understand them, but actually find them interesting.  In MONEYBALL, he uses Billy Beane as a vehicle to tell a story about a man who distrusts the indicators of success in major league baseball.  Beane goes against the grain of widely held beliefs, and creates a team even his own manager has trouble believing in.  He is a maverick in a world of bluebloods, who cannot fathom his competing with a smaller war chest until he actually wins a Division title twice in a row.  He sees value where no one else can, including his own scouts, advisors, and manager.  His competitors see him as a Shaman, or worse, a man who has struck a deal with the devil.<br /><br />In The Big Short, the story is almost the same.  Steve Eisman was an anomaly on Wall Street.  He is a man with a conscience.  He was sickened at the thought of Mortgage Companies selling their product the same way car dealerships used to sell cars.  In other words, working backwards with people who could not discern financial prudence to come to a dollar figure that they believed they could afford.  Folks in the lower middle class became increasingly angry when they discovered they had been misled into signing up for 12.5% home loans.  After the anger, came the defaults and foreclosures.<br /><br />Steve Eisman, and a small team of his, intuitively saw that the mortgage market was steadily being built on higher and higher risk.  As the mortgages became bundled, and sold as bonds and stocks by the trading houses, Eisner was distrustful that the financial success would last.  He bet against these funds.<br /><br />This begins a fascinating story of a small group of mavericks who saw what others could not.  It is also a scary tale of financial Armageddon, and a Government that is is almost as clueless as the Financial Barons of Wall Street.<br /><br />Michael Lewis knows how to sniff out a story.  This is a huge one, and leaves me thirsting for more of his product.

Although incredibly violent SoA is very well done and even the worst violence has a vital place in the story line. Great acting all around , really interesting stories, fascinating back history of Gemma, Clay and John. I'm hooked.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Given the cast, where were the witticisms, double entendre, scathing criticisms??? When the big moment is \\"eff you\\", that's cheap and lazy writing is what that is.  Good Gawd, really is that the best they can do.  No it isn't, and shouldn't have been let slide with this. Magnificent cast and setting, choppy scene cutting and absolutely \\"ordinary\\" dialogue. I resent paying to listen to what 3 high school students could have written.  Perhaps I grew up reading The New Yorker I was expecting too much, was I really?  If you're a complete operatic addict, rock on, if not, don't waste your money.

B004J4WLB4|3.0|Diffenbaugh understand the world Victoria has survived.  We see the consequences  of that life when Victoria leaves the house and her helpless baby. You want to scream at the pages, &#34;go back&#34;.  I understand the author's wish to provide hope.  I understand the author wanting to show that there are people capable of forgiveness. This highly readable book was weakened by too many non-judgmental characters and an ending  that was tied up just like one of Victoria's bouquets: it doesn't matter how it ends as long as we get the content.  This author will get better and I look forward to her next book.

B00F91H666|1.0|Why did they have to COMPLETELY deviate from the book?<br />This movie took nothing from the book but the title and few lines about Israel.  That is it!  The book was rather good, except for its worship of the UN, but the movie just threw away everything good and made up a whole new storyline which made little sense and was basically one big advertisement for the United Nations.<br />I cannot even enjoy a zombie movie anymore without liberal politics being shoved down my throat.  No thank you.
B0081336FO|5.0|I really enjoy the humor and drama in this series as well as the character development. Great, quirky acting. Can't wait for more!

B001NHNG64|4.0|This was fast pased and action packed in a more relatable way than some of Lee's others I have read.  The time you spend listening inside Reachers' head brings more beleivability and cohesion to His characterin this installment.
B0088W7VNG|3.0|If you overlook the REALLY stupid stuff, then this show passes the time.<br />For example, every alien planet they go to speaks English when not even every nation on Earth speaks it!  Or, They continuely use P90's, a weapon designed as a sidearm for vehicle crewman and using, essentially a pistol cartridge, as a main battle rifle against what appear to be armored opponenets who are amazingly resistant to trauma to begin with.  To top that off, they are blowing WAY more ammunition than they could possibly be carryiing with them.  Sorry,  I am an old Infantryman, you can never have enough ammo but Dang!  These guys blow it like it is going out of style and would run dry in seconds.  unless they have a tractor trailor loaded down, like the one obviously setting behind the camera, there is just no way they could possibly operate.  A more realistic weapon would be a heavier caliber rifle round, with more &#34;punch&#34; to penetrate and trasfer kinetic energy to the types of targets they are engaging.  I would take a nice German G3 myself.  Even an old fashioned Ak47 would be better than what they are toting around.<br />I also get a kick out of them using AT-4 unguided anti-tank rockets like they are stinger missiles, against aircraft.  Did the producers ever bother to consult with ANYONE who has ever been in ANY military?  Just wondering.<br />This IOA, an international control organization, that does not know its butt from a whole in the ground, being mindlessly placed in charge of something which is clearly funded entirely by the United States and which is made up almost entirely of US personnel, is a bit disgusting also.  At least make them seem compotent and not so disgusting.<br />All of that said, there is a lot of action and the charachters are intersting.  The individual show plots are mildly intrigueing.  As modern &#34;bad TV&#34; goes, this is better than most.

0345803485|5.0|I like this book, when I had to put it down I really wanted to pick it back up to read more.<br />At first I was not impressed by the writing style but as I read on I must have gotten used to it, not sure<br />why it was mildly annoying at first, I suppose the style seemed to simplistic to me compared to other books I've read, but it definitely gets the point accross. It honestly appears like soft porn, but it is so much more interesting since it goes in depth into bdsm. It has a few (what I consider) comic moments, which i liked. It's very emotional and gets into the technicalities or rules of sub/dom relationships and from the submissives point of view, what it's like to her. I can't spoil the ending for you because I'm only half way through and I don't wish to spoil the suprises. If I'm still impressed by the end, I may go to the next book when I have time. I'm surprised to see it's a #1 New York Times Bestseller, based on the content, but hey, curiosity goes a long way, I suppose.

B00DM0UTPQ|4.0|I am a massive Ed Harris fan so wanted to see this just beacuse he is in it. It is `based' on actual events that took place during The Cold War, when the nuclear stand off between America and Russia had us on the edges of our seats a few times and saw the emergence of CND, (now sadly reduced to a fashion logo). Ed Harris plays Demi the Captain of a diesel powered submarine with nuclear capability. He and his crew have just finished a lengthy mission when he is ordered back to sea.<br /><br />Demi has been suffering seizures from an earlier incident which left him with a head injury. His judgement is sometimes impaired and in good old naval tradition he uses rum to sort out the whole problem. As was the case in those days everyone has a political officer on board and his is actually a friend, however they are also accompanied by some very zealous KGB types who are going to test a top secret new weapon. The KGB are led by Bruni played by David `X-Files' Duchovny. It soon becomes apparent that the KGB are not all they seem to be and might just be going rogue, but as Harris and his men discuss; you only go rogue for two reasons, one is to defect and the other is to start a war; no one thinks these uber Communista types are about to start working for Uncle Sam, and so the scene is set for a rather good thriller.<br /><br />Now there are a few issues with this film that may turn some people off, for starters they are all supposed to be Russian and yet all speak with their normal accents which I know is fine but I would have liked a veiled attempt to at least pretend to pronounce all your `R's backwards etc or put in `ski' after a few things- still never mind. Then some of the scenes are a bit modern the port is so not 1968, they would have referred to each other as `comrade' and not `sir' etc. There is a full list for real anoraks on IMDB in case you are bothered.<br /><br />All of that said I still really enjoyed it, it was suspenseful, it was tense and there were some very good performances, Harris and Duchovny were brilliant as was one of my favourites Lance Henriksen as Markov who you may remember from `Millennium' or as the robot in `Aliens' or indeed `Aliens vs. Predators'. The production is generally impressive and everyone puts in solid performances and the time just flew by. So for some Cold War retro thrills you could do a lot worse than to check this out.ery good performances, Harris and Duchovny were brilliant as was one of my favourites Lance Henriksen as Markov who you may remember from `Millennium' or as the robot in `Aliens' or indeed `Aliens vs. Predators'.

B003VDX6N6|5.0|I think some of the best characters portrayed by some fine actors who make this fantastic yarn into a believable moment. The story is constantly evolving ;Eric Balfour's character Duke (one of my favorites), has become a very like able character , a compassionate side is emerging .  The other character ; Audrey (Emily Rose) , is still discovering secrets of her past. Just  a great show .

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Whenever I see a sequel to something whether it be a TV show, movie or game - I tend to wonder about how it will measure up to the original.<br /><br />Most disappoint. However, Anger Birds is one of the few exceptions.<br /><br />Star Wars II, no doubt, is one of the best games in this series. It's definitely worth downloading and playing.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Once I began reading this book there was no putting it down!!!! Heartwarming, heartbreaking, tears shed and laughter laughed. I could so easily identify with these women and their innermost feelings! I would recommend this wonderful book to anyone!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I found it is a good device for people who want to cast programs to their big screen TV.  If you have a duel graphics card on your PC, you would not need this device, as you can already use the TV as an extra monitor.  For your cell phone it works great.  I also found that it will cast when I set my TV for my X-box.  It will alow me to cast other sites(than Netflixs or You Tube), my videos and music from my cell phone.  I do not have an I pad.  I do not know how it works.  The one thing I cannot figuar out is how to cast from my PC.  I can see it growing in usefulness.
1897299214|1.0|I dropped the class that this book was to be used for.  The text was very uninteresting and I just could not get into it.
B004V9MU86|3.0|Not all Germans participated in the Nazi takeover of the German mind.  Those that didn't had a hard time of it in order to stay out of the Concentration Camps.  This is the story of some poverty stricken but dignity high people on the outskirts of Munich.  In a way it reads a bit like a 'what about us?' plea pointing out that not only the German Jews suffered.  The family is a made up one of the eponomous 'book thief' a young las whose foster father teachers her to read and as well as Hans the foster father there is Tosa the foster mother whos endearments as genuine but sound savage.  The fourth member of the house hold is Max whom Hans and Rosa house for a long period and the quality of the human relationships between the four people in the house has a noble quality on aching poverty and political and social oppression.<br /><br />However the novel has a sookie quality.  Its a romance story and we 'know' from the time of the appearance of Max that he would survive the war and that he and the foster child would go off to Australia and make babies.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|It's so easy to dismiss a horror novel for being supernatural, and thus wholly unbelievable.<br /><br />King is at the top of his craft in this masterpiece.  He flawlessly writes from the perspective of each character in the book.  There's perhaps eight main characters; each one has a different viewpoint of the world, and you immediately transform to their specific view when they become the narrator of the chapter.  Not only that, but the book moves between their childhood and adult years, and King is able to move between these time periods without a hiccup.<br /><br />In this single novel, Stephen King single-handedly made Coulrophobia a &#34;thing&#34;.  You can't put it down, you don't want to keep reading it (it is fiction, but it will scare the heck out of you!), but it immensely holds up to the test of time.  Amazing book.

The latter was so suspenseful, and also &#34;evil&#34;. However, like many sequels, this one fell short. I couldn't bear to look at the victim in this one, too gross and sensationalized, I felt. Perhaps, Hollywood's way of enticing prospective movie-goers?

B001EBV0OY|5.0|As one of my favorites since the first time I had ever seen it, drawing me in with its two introductions and plot development from the first five minutes. Every time the film was on television, watching it gave me something different every time. There was a new fact or scene giving another feel or theme within the plot. The Shawshank Redemption starts with two introductions, presenting both of our main characters, Andy Dufresne and Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding. Andy is a banker, falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover, while Red's background was never revealed. But even from the first few minutes of the movie, with these introductions, two main themes repeatedly jumped out from the story. Of the many characteristics of a film, themes are only a fraction of what makes this film fantastic, but with the two simple themes of hope and freedom.<br /><br />The first symbol of freedom displayed in the film is a negative theme. Right off of the opening credits, it could not be ignored. Within the first introduction, Andy's freedom was taken away from him by false accusation. Secondly, Red's introduction revealed him getting rejected by the Parole Board after twenty years in Shawshank Prison. Both scenes reject their freedom, but from there, it keeps building positively. Of the many examples within the movie, there is one that sticks out the most. When Andy finally does get out of prison, it's during a thunder storm. He stands up, raises his arms and his head to the sky; no words are spoken, and nothing but Andy's laughter, the rain, and thunder is heard in the scene. Just with this image, the theme of freedom produced is almost tangible. Thinking about getting out of jail after 19 years is unimaginable until the final feeling of freedom is revealed.<br /><br />The second theme is hope. This also begins negatively when both introductions produce negative hope. It picks up much more quickly though. Another main character within the story is a man named Brooks. He is older andhas been in jail for fifty years when his parole was granted. But Brooks has a hard time on the outside. He writes a letter to his friends in the jail (consisting of Andy, Red, and a few others). \\"I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay...\\" (he hung himself). This theme of useless hope re-emerges when Andy mentions his dream life. Red tries to shut it down, but Andy remains stubborn toward his fantasy. This theme continues a while later when Andy is gone and Red's parole is accepted. He is released (another example of freedom), but then experiences the same feelings Brooks does. Although Andy made Red promise to perform a task, Red doesn't see the point. Hope finishes out our movie when Red keeps his promise. The movie ends with Red finding a letter from Andy. \\"I hope I can make it across the border. I hope I can see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the pacific is as blue as it is in my dreams. I hope...\\"<br /><br />The Shawshank Redemption offers so many more examples for hope and freedom than the ones used here. With these two simple themes repeated countless times in different settings, this movie keeps its audience thinking. There is always a new idea, theme, example, concept, or characteristic able to pick out every time the film is shown. I've seen it countless times and the two simple themes continue to stand out and support each other through new-found evidence. A recommendation to all, a drama never to be forgotten, and a movie that will enthrall new--and audiences for years to come, The Shawshank Redemption leaves a warm feeling of satisfied resolution.

B00005Y228|5.0|I bought this as my first Kylie Minogue album, I had heard Love at First Site Before years ago, and also had listened to Aphrodite before. When I first popped in the CD, the first track engaged me and set the context for the rest of the album. The second track, Love At First Sight is one of my favorite songs, and the disco pop flavor is mind blowing. The rest of the CD also has the same disco pop flavor, but with a more refined early 2000's minimal pop flavor, its very mature, no bubblegum, here. Overall, this is a legendary album that any connoisseur of amazing music should own. Buy it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I was very pleased that Kindle Fire had this King's game as an app.  I loved playing this game on King.com on my laptop.  So now I am able to play it with my Kindle Fire and this game is a little more exciting than the original one on King.com.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|As a Trekkie, I liked it.  Yet, as a Trekkie, I thought it was a little clowny.  It seemed like every shot had to have at least 3-4 of the main characters in frame and posed like Avenger super heroes.  Ok.  The technical part of this film and special FX are superb.  If I had a new Smart TV or hi-HDTV set, this would look and sound amazing.  For me, that is half the battle in liking a flick, so take away a few of those clowny moments, I would watch this one again.  Beeming out...
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Amazing book, just very confusing at times.the word choice and language is very big, but it makes you want to fall in love
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Ill admit, I cheated. I watched the movie before I read the book and that can have a huge impact on whether you like it or not. The two have little to nothing in common, and that can be a good thing and a bad thing but why cant both be good? They both are good. I do believe they need to make a movie from the book but it may have to be too intelligent for the average summer teenager crowd (the book is too sophisticated and intelligent for the Kardashian-honeyboo crowd). However, the movie isn't too shabby either for just a suspense-filled, exciting, well-acted popcorn pleaser. If you go in thinking its gonna be like the book, you'll prob. hate it, but if you see it as a separate entity, then its a rather tense, thrilling fun little gem of a movie. Never been a Pitt fan, but gotta admit, he does the leading man-hero thing quite admirably here. A Timberlake or Tatum wouldn't have worked, but Pitt makes a believable and resourceful hero and does it well. And gotta admit, The tough as nails Israeli soldier is prob. my favorite character in the movie, other than Pitt. Something about a tough, without trying to be, badass woman is extremely attractive and the Israeli actress is perfect for the role. Other than \\"The Conjuring\\", WWZ was the only movie I spent money on this past summer, and it was a delightful choice.

159463176X|3.0|The first half is wonderful storytelling using various techniques. The author begins with a legend of a father who loses a child to a \\"monster\\" called a \\"div\\". The story continues with a tale of a poor Afghan village, specifically a father of two children---one a boy of 10 and his three year old sister. The sister is \\"sold\\" to a childless couple who provide for the poor family. The tale is further advanced by using a letter written by the couple's servant. At this point, confusion begins. While another technique---an interview of the wife/mother of the girl---reveals the character and motivations of the mother, the introduction of many people, places and times are frustrating since it is not always clear how they relate to the story. I was able to follow the delicate connections but this technique doesn't satisfy---what happened to the boy from the poor village? We are treated to a biography of the sister and others but where is her brother? The last 50 or so pages are flat despite the heartbreaking events taking place. I wondered if I should continue reading. Was it worth it to finish the book? The answer is yes. While the book has flaws and may be frustrating at times, reading this novel is certainly worthwhile.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Good movie and 3D effects are good. While the 3D is minimal they look like the movie was produced with 3D in mind.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I don't know if these reviews are fake or not but the first time I downloaded and went to log in the app crashed!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This is the second book I've read by Rainbow Rowell.  Her characters are wonderful and I become completely engaged with their lives.  I cannot put her books down.  When they end, I want to demand the sequel!  I wasn't particularly interested in reading about a girl who was consumed with characters from pre-teen novels.  Now I want to become a fanfiction author and keep writing about the Fangirl characters so that I can continue their stories!<br /><br />Loved it!  Can't wait until the next Rainbow Rowell offering!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'll look for other work by this author because this book was so well written. Great use of parallel  plot lines and diversity of characters allows most readers to identify with at least one.<br />The opening chapter pulls the reader in and never lets you go!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoy this version of solitaire.  It is just challenging enough while still being very relaxing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely loved every page of this book! It was so heart warming and brought you close to the characters! I love the strength and courage of the characters! My new favorite!
B004YMSTRQ|5.0|Great album especially the title track. I always love these guys albums because they tell a story of Vikings and gods.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|At the time it was free and I got it and I was like how is this free.  The graphics are great and its really fun.
0812982622|5.0|Here is a book with breathtaking breadth. The first half chronicles the \\"biography\\" of the main protagonist, a young man who grew up in an orphanage during the first great famine, the Arduous March, in North Korea. His life is defined by poverty and doing what he must to stay alive, which means doing what the state tells him to do. In these first pages, I was struck by just how claustrophobic Johnson was able to make this country feel, without ever describing it as such, and the true art here is the way he manages to balance a world which are at times is a gritty dystopian cityscape, and at other times a study in absurdism, without ever sacrificing the human quality of hero, Jun Do.<br /><br />It is the second half, though, that Johnson's vision really comes alive, and where he plays with conventions of writing a novel. Featuring shifting narratives, genres, and time periods, it could have easily devolved into something of a confused mess in less capable hands, but Johnson pushes the narrative forward by spinning a heartbreaking mystery, and by allowing one character to descend into uncertainty and madness as another finally finds his strength. Yes, Adam Johnson takes a few creative liberties, as any novelist would, but you can also tell that this is a fastidiously well-reasearched book, and, more importantly, it is the characters that make North Korea and Pyongyang real, not the other way around.<br /><br />Thematically, the central struggle in The Orphan Master's Son is what makes an identity? Is it your name? your family? you history, or just the story you make up? And who owns that?<br /><br />A fascinating look into North Korea, and a story I won't be forgetting soon.
034580709X|5.0|I just started with Jo Nesbo and feel so lucky because of it!  I'd heard about his Harry Hole character and this is a phenomenal book to suck you into more.  I love finding a wonderful author, for thrillers and comedy, and the thought that I have more books to catch up with is very satisfying indeed.  Can't wait to finish so I can start the next!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a game changer!  Some of the best reasons and proof about why being positive works and why what you place your mind on really does expand!
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|Having paid a fortune on buying the Kindle addition of 30 shades of gray, and being disgusted with the quality of writing and plot. I decided to remebered old favorites
1781162646|4.0|The characters popped out of like colors in a rainbow. Great mystery and intrigue. I will read this one again soon. Really hit some good nostalgia notes. I literally couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This is just good overall fun, exciting and cotton-candy delictable read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It was the first game I played on Android and even after 3 years I have it on my cellphone, I play it whenever I get time and never got bored from the levels and cute characters which kill pigs :)
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|So apt a quip is cited early in this movie.  This group of golden agers live at the Home for Retired Musicians.  I have to admit however, the movie blurs the edges and lightens the indignities of growing old.  I have always dreaded the onset of the &#34;vegetable patch&#34; for me, but I would not mind this one; rather I would relish it.  Perhaps as I grow ever closer, a film such as this might act as an inspiration.  Maggie Smith does her usual larceny of the best acerbic lines.  Pauline Collins does a charming Alzheimer's which is aspirational. Actually there is no not a bad apple in this magnificent cast.  Just watch it.
B0056FMNYA|5.0|I was actually a little iffy when I first purchased this little guy. I thought it might be a little too bulky. After spending a couple of days of shooting with it strapped to my side I decided that it really isn't bulky at all. I've attached to to a regular belt (not sure about what kind of long term damage it might do) and it works just fine. The weight distribution is so balanced. it really doesn't feel like the camera is trying to fall of my hip. I plan on purchasing the tripod adapter so I can have an easy transition when taking landscapes.
B001EPYQO6|5.0|The movie is simply outstanding... panned by some critics, which it all the more appealing since it reverberates within most of us. The personal battle scenes are exceptional, as are the other members of the cast.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|FINISHED THE THIRD BOOK after taking a break. I wanted to find out why Mr..Grey was the way he was. The author pulled it together very nicely. AN ENJOYABLE READ.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like that I can access my kindle books anywhere, anytime.  It was easy to install, and is easy to use.
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|My wife and I had our usual high expectations for almost any BBC/PBS Mystery Series but felt that after a couple of dramatic episodes the tension seemed to let down and the story started to &#34;wander&#34;.<br />As much impressed &#34;Foyle's War&#34; fans we feel the &#34;Broadchurch&#34; scripts are not up to the standard of Anthony Horowitz's writing for the former series and his wonderful &#34;Collision&#34; (highly recommended!)
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like having the Yahoo app on my android tablet.  It just makes for easy access to my mail.  And it was simple to download and simple to use.
B00AEFYDV8|5.0|I bought this movie as it was on sale. I had read other John Grisham books but not this book from which movie is based on. Matt Damon plays rookie lawyer Rudy Baylor in over his head in a high profile insurance case. His client is dying and the boys mother had made payments for the insurance but are refusing to pay for his treatment. Opposin him is a team of legal sharks led by Jon Voight. Danny Devito plays Deck Shifflet, a paralawyer who specializes in flunking bar exam, who is helping Rudy Baylor with the case. Rudy's chances are slim until he finds a trail of corruption and deceit that might lead him to one thing that could win the case-the truth.
1416583432|5.0|very easy read, if you take dogs seriously and what are there abilitiyes and needs you will find this book very helpful and informative.
B000J3OTSM|3.0|I bought this movie as it was on sale. Stars Channing Tatum as Tyler Gage, a rough and streetwise hunk who is doing community service at a school for the performing arts, after being caught in a robbery. While there he meets Nora, a beautiful and privileged classically trained dancer played by Jena Dewan, who is seeking a replacement for her injured dance partner. Seeing Tyler dancing, Nora decides to take a chance on him as her dance partner. As the began training, tension builds, tempers flare and the differences in their backgrounds explode-igniting this electrifying tale about not giving up on your dreams.
1476734941|4.0|Research information and facts explained in plain language. It is a good reading if you are trying to find ways to loose weight.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|too sad and horrendous, wouldn't recommend it , these days we need more cheerful and inspiring stories to enlighten us.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this read.  Good characters and the author addressed a difficult subject in a way that led the reader to think about a provocative topic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome! Best book I have ever read in my whole entire life!! can't wait to read the next two books I'm so excited
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Hilarious! I laughed til my sides ached. Although it was a bit hard to understand from time to time due to my inability in grasping some Brit dialects, it was still one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages.
B00BEIYOMC|5.0|Wow, this movie really surprised me. It was a lot different than what i had imagined, i loved it, i enjoyed it and i actually went out with friends to see it on Friday The 13th which made that experience a whole lot more fun and the movie was really creepy definitely scary, that red demon in the first film wasn't really doing it for me :/ The \\"Bride In Black\\" just gives me the hebbie jeebies. That is the one thing i did not like about this film, we didn't get to see much of her creepin around which in my opinion would have made the film a lot better. Though saying that i do like that by not showing too much it gets the audience to wanna see more and not over show things is a good thing at times. Well anyway hell yes im buying this intimately on blu-ray whenever it comes out, i'm hoping this year and not January. I seen this 3 times at the cinemas :D hope you all enjoy it cuz i know i did. I hope they make a 3rd somehow, we need more movies like these and i hope next time around we get to see more of The Bride In Black Dx awesome scary movie i give it a 5 lol duh
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I think it is a good movie because it has replay value. It is fun and I like the twist they are binging into the series from the past series of movies.  Hmmm, thinnk I'll watch it again right now.....
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|What a great comic adaption!! I was really impressed with the movie, and if you think about it its very relevant to our society today with Obama's surveillance of our lives. The movie inspired me to get the comics which just really resonated with me. If you do decide to get the comics get the compilation version after number 12 because its in color. However the other ones are very good too.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Korbin
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Excellent acting, plot and suspenseful. Series is by far the most enjoyable i have seen on regular tv in a while.  If not for amazon this series would have escaped my attention, since i normally don't watch regular tv.  Let me also add being commercial free is a triple plus.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|The only thing that keeps me from playing this game is the constant bombardments from enemy ships at the first level.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love fantasy and sci fi.  That being said, I was probably one of the few that couldn't get into that big vampire series.  This came out at the perfect time.  I read all three books after seeing this movie, and can't wait for the next one to come out.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book stayed with me long after I'd read the last page. It was a very visual book and a pleasure to read. Compelling story line and difficult to put down. Highly recommended.
014241493X|3.0|I love John Green, but Paper Towns just didn't do it for me. The characters reminded me a lot of those in Looking For Alaska (which is incredible), but the story was very slow.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|This is a story in a story in a story. It requires re-reading to get the most from it. Fascinating. Intricate and skilfully woven, it requires concentration so if you're after something light to read, this is not the book for you. I admire this author and am keen to read more.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great movie could not put it away!!!!had to run out and get the rest of the series to see what happens
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the way Khaled Hosseini writes.  I just want to gobble up his books in one sitting, and begin the next one as soon as I'm finished.  He takes me into a world so different from my own.  He's so deliciously descriptive that I feel like I am watching a movie in my head, not reading a book.  And the Mountains Echoed is told from many different characters' perspectives, which I loved.  This book is a must read, especially if you liked Hosseini's previous works (The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns). I can't wait for his next masterpiece.
B00D5RJTQ6|4.0|Radke shows some true colors through the significance of his lyrics. He reinvents himself and shows the diversity of his talents via incorporation of hip hop and electronic influence to a hardcore background. I cannot help but get the sense that the creative invention was Ronnie's, though I don't wish to discredit the band for its ingenuous support and obvious technical ability. I am personally thrilled with the direction that recovery has led this band and can't wait for the next album.
B00C061HZY|1.0|It came with some scratches and the record kept skipping. I could not enjoy the music from my record player.
1419701533|5.0|one two three four five six seven i just need a couple more or seven more words to too you kid bid bear
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I cant stop playing this game! I wish it was a little easier to obtain gems, but as an overall I love it!
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|I like the idea of the game, but it isn't great to play. It takes a lot of time to build each thing...with kids it loses their attention quickly.  Also no where near enough pieces to build most of what they ask.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just love this game! I ove how you can give them jobs, organize your town, etc. It's a great game!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|All I have to say is it was great. I can't say much else for the sake of the long running joke other than read it for yourself
B002OOG6YY|5.0|Those who have seen the original-issue version of MM's GG&G will instantly understand why they need to pick this Blu-Ray up: that older title was in regular DVD quality, and was put together from several concerts with the video cut up into tiny 2-second pieces and stitched together.  But worse, metal genius Twiggy Ramirez was on the outs (he left the band for a decade or so), to be punished by removing almost all traces of him from the video.  Seriously, you got about five minutes of John 5 shaking his head &#34;no&#34; (probably to indicate &#34;no, I can't possibly rock any harder&#34;, or perhaps &#34;no more tonight, I can't see with all this sweat in my eyes&#34;), and 20 seconds of Twiggy stomping around the background in a hausfrau's dress with combat boots.<br /><br />But this superb Blu-Ray is no mere cleanup of old footage to make a buck: this is a totally new video: it has the same songs, but is composed entirely from the single tour-ending show in Los Angeles, with a more relaxed editing speed.  We don't get to see Marilyn in as wide a variety of costumes, but this is true HD quality, with excellent audio, of a single outstanding concert.  For me, though, the best part is Twiggy, restored in the footage as a full member of the band -- you can actually see him just as much as the other supporting musicians.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am really busy, but this game is great when you have even a few minutes of down time to play. However, I do wish the loading whenever you open the game was faster though.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Love this album, but then again I don't think Jack's ever put out a bad one! Just writing in to say that I was surprised to get two discs inside the cover, I thought it was a 2-disc set until I discovered they were the same! I will donate the extra disc to the local community radio station.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great fun and exciting I give it five stars anytime.It get my undivided attention every time I play.I also introduced it to my grandson and my fiance give it a try you would have fun.<br /><br />IF YOU,ARE BOARD THEN YOU MUST LPAY IT WILL TAKE YOURIND OFF BEING BOARD SO JUST GO FOR  IT.
B008OOYALE|3.0|When I say this app, all I could think about was another app called Dragonvale.  They're about the say thing for kindle fire:  Breed Hybrids, decorate your park, level your dragon to epic, plants treats or food, it just sounds the same to me.  Though the only thing that is different, is that you can play with friends using Storm8 or something.  Dragonvale uses Facebook.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This cloud works seamlessly on my Galaxy S4 and my home computer. It makes taking and accessing photos no trouble at all.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is very very very fun, I think it's for everyone and all ages.  My dad even plays it!!!  The only thing I wish I could get friends.  I use a Kindle fire, so I cant get friends. It's a really fun game, though Kindle Fire user's, you wont be able to get friends, so, ya.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|Willow is a great family film directed by Ron Howard and written by George Lucas & Bob Dolman. Val Kilmer stars as Madmartigan. The picture quality is good and the audio is great.

B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Good game, too short and too much money. I would like to see the cost go down in the near future.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|We love the doctor,  he is awesome, great scifi family show. David tenet grows on you but we still prefer Matt smith
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Don't know why I waited so long to do it -- love the ease of operation and the synchronization of all devices.  Now I am never at a loss for something to read no matter where I am.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic Acting - great script. Very moving story and an interesting take on history. The ways they address class issues and issues relating to the roles of women and men are very compelling.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|He loves Star Wars and angry birds put  em together you've got a big winner !<br />He loved the first ABSW so he loves this too but he says the pigs are still the bad guys!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Book 1 was plodding at the beginning; Book 3 was too much chasing.  This one explained the what's and why's
B003B02OOG|5.0|I am a big fan of Grisham's books, and I enjoyed this book of short stories very much. Each one could have been an entire novel, and at the end of each one I was wanting more. He has a great style for creating the settings in his stories to the point that you actually feel like you are there and a part of the story.<br />I am hoping Grisham will use anyone of these short stories and expand them into a novel. I know I will certainly download it on my kindle!<br /><br />Grisham novels are always on my must read list.
B0047BXR1W|5.0|A family-friendly film with lessons of friendship and the true meaning of acceptance and love.  Wonderful story and great cast.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like being able to make my own variations. You are able to put in as much volume for each sound to suit your preference.  Very creative. Songs for any sleeping need. Terry
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just recently became a fan of The Walking Dead and it is an incredible series!  Me and my husband watched Series 1 and 2 on Netflix and couldn't locate Series 3 so I was thrilled to learn that Amazon had it available!  We enjoyed all episodes!  The story is not so much about the Zombies themselves but about human beings and how they react in these situations: their strengths, weaknesses, the will to survive, the agonizing decisions.  More importantly the realization that even in the face of a world crisis you still have mankind fighting for power, stealing, and killing instead of working together (fear the living).  As one other commentary put it &#34;good people doing bad things and bad people doing good things.&#34;
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Brilliant... Few TV shows are intelligently done now a days and this has it all! Thanks for not wasting  my time
B0015346OM|5.0|He liked the book but he found it an issue remembering everyone's names . There were a lot of people involved but the mission was exciting.
0439023513|5.0|Awesome book!  I hate this book had to end.  If you read the first two books then what are you waiting for
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and the way you can collect or level up so quickly. only problem is the movie theater don't load.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Outstanding series.....wonderful actors and superior plot line.  Hard to find anything like this today.  Bravo to PBS....keep it going! Yeah!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|One of the best films about music I've ever watched. Very inspirational, very touching, and rounded off with some fantastic new music. What more can you ask for.
B000001EGE|5.0|What's not to say about Elton John that is not most complimentary? It was especially nice<br />being able to find and order some of his older recordings.  This was purchased for my boyfriend's<br />Birthday and I have had the pleasure of listening to it often since I gave it to him. Thank you Amazon.<br /><br />Jennie Chevalier
140006922X|5.0|As a not-religious reader, my interest in Zealot had more to do with wanting to understand the historical underpinnings of my own Western culture than seeking some validation of faith. I love that the writer's approach is scholarly and historical, and that he has distilled mountains of academic work (just read the endnotes!) into a very readable, engrossing book. The story of Jesus the man is a complex amalgam of politics, religion, culture and history, compellingly related in Zealot.<br /><br />I am struggling with how to relate just how profoundly this book has affected my thinking. Aslan's explanation for 2000 years of errant Christian anti-Semitism is brilliant, and something I had never heard adequately explained. His descriptions of Jewish life in Palestine under Roman rule--the brutality, the politics and the religious practices of the time--have enormous resonance in thinking about that part of the world today.<br /><br />I can't say how Christian readers will respond to this book, but my hope would be that the view of Jesus the man would serve to enhance and enrich anyone's understanding of this major historical and cultural figure, and his times.
B000059T1E|5.0|I absolutely loved this CD.  I purchased it as a Birthday gift for my Boyfriend and he has played it<br />Non-stop every since.  I was not familiar with &#34;Traffic&#34; at all, nor their music but am extremely happy<br />he had mentioned the title song.  Never to late to appreciate something &#34;new&#34;.
B007THA4FI|1.0|The story line was so hard to follow I found myself wondering where the story line was.  I was never able to finish it and was falling asleep by the second chapter.  Terrible writing from one of the worlds best storytellers.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved it, the story kept you interested and wanting more , I will be looking for more written by this author
B0000028RR|4.0|This one is essential for those who like rebellious punk/metal with a vocal delivery that is defiantly front and center. The political views of the singer are expressed in a forceful fashion, often repeating phrases over and over to let the audience really get the full effect. Most of the lyrics are anti-government/establishment. He preaches that the radicals should stop giving into the system as it is and demonstrate through actions that we will not be passive sheep anymore and will define our society according to a new set of values that are not based on greed and conformity.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Very chill music, great to listen to if you just want to relax. She has a real unique voice that is nice to listen to
B000001IMX|3.0|Early eighties West Coast punk with a perverted comical element. It's an essential representation of teen angst and bored suburban kids living with their parents and frustrated with the Reagan era right-wing government. It has a certain charm in it's youthful naivety. There are definitely classic songs like &#34;Institutionalized&#34;, &#34;Subliminally&#34; and &#34;I Saw Your Mommy&#34;. It is very energetic and is a great album for pounding out aggression. I don't give it more than three stars because it kinda wears thin quickly and is more of a sentimental album than an album that I continue to discover new things about.
B0094K1K42|1.0|For someone with Charlize Theron's caliber, this was terribly disappointing.  Although I saw the message the movie was gunning for, it wasn't satisfying in terms of delivery or execution.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|the game is exelent I got the angry birds star wars 3 I got it yesterday and I beet the hole levles.
B0058BI896|5.0|funny episode I have watched it three time.  The cast always keeps you laughing. I have nothing else to add.
630542828X|5.0|This movie was and is a tribute to character..sorely lacking in the legal field today. Remembered this as one of Travolta's surprises...liked it every bit as much these years later. The supporting cast will amaze...not going to be a spoiler just buy it and be happy to own a GOOD movie!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Well crafted mystery disguised in a science fiction setting.  I had not read any information about this series so had no preconceived ideas about the story line.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I honestly was duped until the end - I had no idea who done it. An excellent film, exciting on the edge of your seat action as a group of individual magicians, former street hustlers and cons are drawn together by an invitation from a secret society leaving enticing direct clues that would make them notoriously famous and the FBI look like the horses ends of the beasts carrying The Four Horsemen. That name alone should've given us insight but like their feats of illusion we are their victims as we watch.<br /><br />  A stellar cast and outstanding performances.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Why did I sit through this entire movie!? I wish I hadn't. There was not one likable character, the actors all seemed miscast and the story was boring. Lesson learned. I can't imagine why this movie would be enjoyable for anyone. Oh, the clothes were great.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Amazing show.  If recommend it if you like scifi.  Watch stargate sg1 first though. This show is a must watch.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Nothing warm and fuzzy about this police drama.  First episode sets up what looks like to be a great run, ending with the &#34;usual and unusual suspects.&#34;
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I love the kind of classic pop songs Paul does here -- and clearly he does, too.  His voice isn't absolutely the strongest, but there's a kind of touching quality to the sort of patina of age you can hear.  A sweetness to this album.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|very fast. A must have for every android user. Great with Greek language compared to other keyboard application. 5 stars.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|They should totally make more books about Carter and Sadie because they are awesome books. By the way check out more of rick riots and books because if you like this one I bet you'll like his other books.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Fantastic read! Rick Riordan is s literary genius. He had a way with words that captures the imagination of young and old alike.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful time piece filled with love, mystery, family rivals, heartbreak, sorror, wit, betrayal, sceaming, and of course the one and only Maggie Smith!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Really enjoyed this game.  The levels are challenging enough that you keep playing.  I would recommend even to novice players.
B00F1RR3Y8|4.0|This game is fun. I downloaded it yesterday. It won't let me download wedding salon so that's how I found it. Probably 39th review. Check out some games by me named meanies be nice. I rate 4 stars cuz u don't do allot.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|It was so real and so heartfelt.  I felt like I knew all of these people and I laughed and cried with them!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Perhaps one of the best books I have ever read. Very emotional at times and it shows a different viewpoint than most holocaust books.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love playing this game. There are no glitches in it like some games. I have my friends and relatives playing it too.
B00846REIS|5.0|The fights are intense & the passion is even more so.  Eva & Gideon's dark pasts make their future together look not so bright; but, their love is worth the fight.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|It's generally accepted that Megadeth's best album is Rust in Peace.  Rust in Peace is fantastic and a five star effort for sure.  Endgame is better.  The instrumentation, songs, lyrics are consistently just a notch above Rust in Peace.  There is not a weak song on this album.  Dave welcomes Chris Broderick (who frankly has not been as good on subsequent albums) and they blow the paint off the walls.  If you are biased towards the first four or five Megadeth albums, get this one (and \\"United Abominations\\").
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This book was extremely well written and thought out, fantastic read and very detailed! I liked the book better than the movie.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|My boys love these games. I've never had any problems until now. My 3 yr old saw a picture of  an angry bird and coins and of course pushed it over and over again wanting to see what would happen. There wasn't anything about paying actual money and honestly I think nothing of it because I have parental controls on. I foolishly thought they couldn't buy anything. Wrong! Even though I have parental controls set to where they can't buy anything they were able to purchase $156 worth of coins on this new game to my account. I call amazon costumer service immediately when I received the emails about this purchase. They then assure me that I will get a full refund and help me turn off the inapp purchase box. I had no idea there even was a separate in app purchase box in your app settings. It's like having a loop hole around your parental controls. I then get off the phone thinking thank goodness they are returning my money only to be let down ten minutes later when I get an email from them saying they have a no refund policy but under the circumstances will refund me $53.96. So here I am extremely aggravated by costumer service for blatantly lying to me about getting a full refund back and I want all other parents out there who don't have a clue on this extra control box to make sure you have it turned off (remove the check mark)so this doesn't happen to you as well.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I have been wanting to see this for a while and finally found the time.  This movie is way better that I expected.  Tilda Swinton is, of course, spectacular as the tortured mother of a horrible boy.  Having a child you can't connect with is every parent's nightmare.  The way the movie played out in flashbacks and recurring themes made it visually very interesting.  Even though you know what's coming, my jaw still dropped when it happened.<br /><br />The most frightening part is that there are families like this out there right now.  Where do you turn when you know your child is an evil sociopath and nobody believes you?
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|You have the perfect wife that holds together this perfect family. Even the bumbling husband is kept inside the ring of perfection until the wife finds out the secret. From that point on everything goes to hell in a handbasket!! Great book! Ending unbelievable.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Saw this concert in a cozy old theatre and he just rocked.  What an awesome musician!  The album is almost as good as my memory of his show.  Chris may be the best singer ever.
B008QMMEOE|2.0|This app should be called 4 Trains because that is what you get for free.  I don't mind paying, just let me know what I am getting for free.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The series is as intriguing as ever. Superbly written hard to put down! Looking forward to book 4 very soon
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|The dynamics of both casts, are different. I loved both shows and would love to see both casts performances on film .<br />Ben Lewis is a very dynamic Phantom and emotes the character well... Ramin is more a physical actor and emotes a very different Phantom.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Crazy lifestyle and I'm not sure how he is even living still. His heroin addiction is sad to read about.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Great show. Sad to see it end in season 9. Looking forward to season 9. Season 8 tied up a lot of lose ends.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|Great show...well worth it. Not for the squeamish.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This was a very entertaining series. Different from the first season in many ways, but still very good. I would recommend Asylum to anyone who likes a good horror film.<br /><br />My only regret with this series is that I watched one or two on Amazon then got hooked and ended up spending like $30 to watch all the episodes. I recommend waiting till it comes out on Netflix.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Pretty good at first then it just gets slower and more prolonged. Well, maybe not. My friend and I fell asleep before it ended.
B007SGM084|5.0|Can't wait to see th  movie!!! My favorite series I have ever read! I hope she comes out with more books!
B00004W510|5.0|I first saw The Band in 1965 when they were Bob Dylan's backup band, then twice more billed equally with Dylan and then twice more by themselves.  I have most of their material.  In fact, I had the brown album reviewed here in LP, cassette tape & CD format (after 1984) so I could play it whenever and wherever.I even bought the book which contained the lyrics to the songs.<br /><br />The Band had a wonderful mix of blues, country,rock, folk, roots music, even a bit of jazz.  Ironically, this Canadian group (not meaning to slight the great Levon Helm) gave us true Americana.<br /><br />Each song is a mini-masterpiece.  The songs transcend time and space- they are remarkable both for the lyrics and the music. And the fact that they had 3 great singers who were multitalented on other instruments as well, is just icing on the cake.  The Band is one of my desert island discs.  (An aside:  I'm a classically-trained musician who loves all kinds of music - another desert island disc is the opera Marriage of Figaro).<br /><br />The Band is certainly their best studio album, and belongs on anybody's Top Ten list.  If you don't have it already, you should buy it.  The remastering is OK - I have an entry-level audiphile music system which is very unforgving of inferior production, and I was able to thoroughly enjoy the music.<br /><br />Even if you think you don't like their music, give it a try - and not MP3, please.  With MP3, the compression is such that you get only about 10% of the music.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I really did not know what to expect from this movie.  Finally watched it and just loved it.  I would watch it again.  Great Actors.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I am not sure why so many people did not like this movie.  Not bad for a Brad Pitt Zombie movie. There was a problem with the volume though, had highs and lows.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|I loved the actors, the story line.  It made me jump out of my seat.  Love movies like this and what is in the hereafter.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I recived the product in a timely manner. It arrived in the condition described. My daughter loved this Disney classic as a child so I purchased a copy for my granddaughter.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Did not ever think I would watch this, but my son's friend wanted to watch this and put on and I sat down and could not stop watching was just great.
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|This record player plays vinyl records very clearly. It has a portable speaker and an auxiliary output, so you can play music on the go or plug it into speakers to play. However, the built in speaker is acceptable for its size but i would recommend plugging in speakers if you have any lying around you can use. You wont need any sort of receiver in order to play it through auxiliary speakers, although i am not so sure about RCA. NOTE: Don't forget yo turn the power on via the switch on its right hand side where the various outputs are located in order to have a good sound output!! It has a tone and pitch adjustment, along with volume output, so you can always mess around with those if you so choose. There is a USB output for recording onto a computer which is a nice feature if you wish to take any of your vinyls to go with you without having to buy a digital version. I am very happy with this purchase and i would highly recommend it for anyone.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Love fantasy movies and this one was great.  Great story and also great actors.  Loved the added characters and story put into this childrens story made for all ages to enjoy.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a good book that I would recommend. It only took my a few days to read because once I started I could not put the book down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It's really close to owning a real life horse. Since I can't actually own a horse right now this is the closest I'm going to get to actually having one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much, but how can you not?? It's Minecraft!! An awesome game and addictive game for Anyone; I highly recommend. At first I wasn't too sure for the cost of it, but trust me it's worth it!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|If this is your first time through the Canon, this is the first collection of the stories. I do suggest you read Study in Scarlett first but this would do just as well. Enjoy
B002RKSXJG|5.0|Wilkie Collins' \\"The Woman in White\\" surprised me.  I expected the same old boring Literature that the critics just love to promote.  Instead, I found a very well-written, interesting, though-provoking, heavily intertwined story.  Even not knowing how old the book is, I'd have thought it to be an great book.  But, adding in the fact that it was written in 1859 makes it even more amazing.  Here's part of the Wikipedia entry for the book:<br /><br />\\"It is considered to be among the first mystery novels and is widely regarded as one of the first (and finest) in the genre of \\"sensation novels\\".  The story is sometimes considered an early example of detective fiction with the hero, Walter Hartright, employing many of the sleuthing techniques of later private detectives.\\"<br /><br />I definitely agree with that.  So, I'm happy to rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.  Highly recommended.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Works fine on an Acer Iconia Tab, but crashes every time right after entering the planeswalker's (name on the Samsung Galaxy S3.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|I don't want to spoil anything in this review, but I thought this movie was going to be good in the beginning but then halfway through it just sort of fizzled out.  I realize it's just a movie, but the concept of the zombies and why they attacked really didn't make a lot of sense.  Maybe if you are a huge zombie fan you'll love this movie, but I like them and this just didn't quite make the cut.  I thought the 28 days movies were way better.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|this book is a great way to live your life better. the four agreements is a very simplified way to look at life
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow!  I love how the story wraps and keeps you guessing.  It is a quick read and amazing plot.  I hope they make this into a movie!
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|The review from \\"Adam2\\" explained everything I love about this release.  It has amazing remixes of the original takes, and the complete New Year's Eve and 3 video tracks (when paired with A Musical History) as a bonus.  Buy it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book, but HATED the ending.  Was so disappointed.  I put all that time into the book (enjoying it all the way) and the ending was such a let down.  Also language was horrible.  I personally have never read a book with such foul language.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Uncategorizable, haunting, beautiful. One of my favorite CDs, and I own thousands. There is a reason it is on so many best-ever lists.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a 2-part book covering innovation and Tesla's life. Tesla had a hand in almost every major electrical discovery of the 20th century but was unable to overcome his opponent's political and financial backing that always seemed to be against him. This story of Tesla's life gives a far different perspective than that rendered by generally accepted history.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Non-stop action in this edge of your seat thriller. A Must See!  It's the Walking Dead on steroids.  Rent it.
0061950726|4.0|It was apart of history that I didn't know existed and I felt the story was well told by the author.
B002VISNAS|3.0|I liked the book and the research he used to explain the &#34;blink&#34;. However at one point the writer repeats the same research and examples. Overall I would recommend it.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|The swatch came in excellent condition in the original packaging. It is easy to read. My students really like the colors of the watch and can read the watch when they ask to know the time. I sometimes need to take it off when working with some students because it does have a loud tick.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun, mindless game to take up time. Great for waiting rooms, public transit or anywhere. No sound needed for game play.
0920668372|5.0|This is a very special children's book that says over and over how special they are.  I buy it for all the expectant parents I know.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My book club chose this book and I'm glad they did. From the first few words, it really draws you in. To hear this little guy tell his story from his perspective is both heartbreaking and enlightening. R.J. Palacio really captured what it's like for someone with August' s challenges and for those who care about him. I highly recommend this book. Excellent read.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I really think this show is great. Worth every penny. This show had me hooked with the first show, and it is worth a shot to anyone who likes a little drama!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this novel and the author's writing style. The surprises and twists make it fun, though I knew one major point before it was revealed.
1401938906|5.0|I've read more than several books on &#34;positive thinking&#34; and other varies forms of the same concept including &#34;The Secret&#34; but NO book or lecture on or about &#34;how our thoughts create our reality&#34; has opened my eyes, my mind and my soul like this little masterpiece! Pam Grout is an amazing writer who had me laughing one minute and crying the next! I wrote to her to tell her how at one moment (and I can't recall the exact one) I actually felt my soul open up and I just sobbed but they were tears of complete joy because finally someone gave it to me straight and the light bulb went off! I guess the tears were also for so much wasted time and energy, energy I could have spent creating a much different life. No discredit to Norman Vincent Peale, Dr. Wayne Dyer and a host of others I've read and listened too but Pam just broke it all down like a friend who loves and cares about you would.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book but more importantly, a book like this should be included in our education system. Had I been educated on this as a young girl I know I would have been sparred a lot of unnecessary grief and hardship as an adult but, I'm so grateful that I found it this book, or I should say,  it found me.  :))
B000O77RLE|5.0|The movie was awesome.  A better cast of actors could not have been chosen.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience what it was like on both sides of the war.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm tellin you this game is so awesome. You get a world tour to play with and hardly has glitches and the only updates are when its time to to another part of the world.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I like Brad Pitt but I didn't watch all of the movie so might not be fair in my assessment.  I bought it for my husband as he is the movie and TV buff but even he wasn't crazy about the movie.  I find all of these zombie, goblin and blood sucking movies too much.  I like a good mystery or even a good love story but all of this make believe, bloody shoot em ups leave me finding a good book in another room.  Why are we so dedicated to the violence and mayhem that is happening not only in the movies and TV series now days but also in real life?<br />The movies and TV of this sort are a gross waste of my time.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a unique puzzle game that progressively increases in complexity as you solve each level.  It seems to me that this game is one that will help to keep certain brain functions sharp as you work through it.  It's very easy to learn and addictive.  You will enjoy this game very much I'm sure.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is so incredibly warm, you feel like you know the people.  Austen 's book is about people, and first impressions, and the prejudices of social class.  The people are lively and funny.  It also is very informative about the position of women and the expectations of making a good marriage.  I highly recommend it.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Good thing this isn't the old days of vinyl as I would have worn this one out. Great balance of  material. Wish the liner notes gave information on each song.  This CD can turn a gray day sunny.
B00B4804KS|5.0|it's a classsic! how can you not like dinosaurs! the 3D is a neat touch as well.  I can't wait for the other ones to come out in 3D
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was one exciting book.  Jack Reacher is an incredible character.  This book got me interested on the first page and I hated to put it down. Unfortunately I had to sleep at night or go to work. If not, I don't think I would have put it down until I finished it. Jack Reacher is a character that you care about and root for. I am reading another Reacher book now, and I know it is going to be as good as Killing Floor.
B009R659L8|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy Mary Higgins Clark, but this book had too many characters in it to flow as well as her past books. I loved the twist at the end, but was confused as to which person actually discovered what. If she were to weed out a few characters, the book would be great!!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers will always be my favorite series of all time.  Outstanding television, outstanding writing, outstanding acting.  After hearing stories from my parents who lived through WW II, this series is the most acurate representation of that horific time in our history.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This movie was a very pleasant surprise. The cast compliments each other very well and the story was well paced and surprisingly engaging.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|What television should be!  Outstanding fiction.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Keeps you wanting more.  Looking forward to season three.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|You should get this game I love to dress her up and do her make up,like she is a real princess
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The music is wonderful and the acting is very good.  You will be wanting more and wish the movie doesn't end so soon.
B004AR4WVM|5.0|Great Sound and quality, great sonics.very pleased with purchase, and glad to see the this album in vinyl, as well as a heavier pressing.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Something to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Actors are superb.  Looking forward to watching future installments of this very fine show.
1451626657|5.0|This is my  second time around for Catch-22 and it's even better this time and more full of fun and thought than I remember.  Should be Required Reading for all!
B001VNB54A|5.0|This series is every bit as good as Band of Brothers.  It filled in the blanks for me as I was not as informed about the Pacific front as I was the European.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|If you want to learn about the subconcious mind this book is the best place to start. You will find most of your questions answered right here. Loved it!!!!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is probably one of the best foreign films I have ever seen and should be required viewing for all students studying history during the Cold War.  Even if you think you don't like movies with  sub-titles, give this one a try.  You son't be disappointed.
071815780X|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase the customer service was really good as my questions were answered in a very timely fashion the book came in very good excellent condition and I got it pretty quick
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for the family and could be played by all ages. It is fun and I have been enjoying this game for many weeks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses are so cute and the game is super easy for all ages. The game cool downs are also super short.
0321714113|5.0|Firstly, do NOT buy this book if it's your first book on C++. You will not be able to appreciate it unless you've gone through something more basic first. This book will take you from beginner to intermediate levels. I don't believe that advanced level comes through book exercises, but through attempting non-trivial problems. I am not advanced level; I am intermediate level and I'm an entry level software engineer at this point.<br /><br />This book is solidly dedicated to doing things under the OOP paradigm and doing them as efficiently as possible. The majority of the exercises are focused on figuring out why the code presented does or does not work, or reimplementing something presented previously using the new techniques you've just learned. Nearly everything from the standard libraries is addressed in this book -- it's extremely dense and not for the novice. This book definitely is partially designed for reference, because everything in it is referenced back or forward to other related topics and the table of contents and indices are comprehensive.<br /><br />It's extremely well-done and from my experience thus far it's almost like this text is currently the word of god on the subject of C++. It's one of the highest rated C++ books on stackoverflow.com and pretty much anyone that I know that I can trust on C++ thinks it's a good book. I've only been through the first half of the book, and parts of the latter half. I've done all of the exercises, because they're all helpful in learning to debug C++ code. Debugging C++ can be very difficult at times -- so, I'm trying to code and debug as efficiently as possible. This book is a great resource on this subject.
B005L38QHA|3.0|Clicking is almost spongy and the fluidity of the mouse movement feels cheap.  The app feels quickly thrown together and the LED glow is even cheap looking.  Kudos for the paint job on it, but functionality and the LED visuals leave something to be desired.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I highly recommend this game for all.  Very simple and easy to play.  Options are easily configured and saved.<br />Download from Amazon app store.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Top quality Sci-Fi. I would recommend this to any Sci-Fi buff. Well acted/directed with a great plot twist. Kevin Spacey as the voice of the computer was a plus.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|This was by far the best book in the series. It's thrilling and suspenseful, with a bit of humor. One of my favorite parts is at the end, when Alex is sent into space.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If we all could live each day for what it is, like a dog, we could enjoy more and worry less
B008S80PCE|5.0|I could not find any of Bill Withers albums locally and wanted to add his work to my collection. this is a very complete set of his work.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It does regenerate coins (every 30 seconds you get one) - so if you run out you either 1) sell prizes you've earned for coins 2) wait 30 seconds for one to drop or 3) leave the app and come back later.  This is really a fun game and I'd love to play more.  But I refuse to buy fake coins to play a fake game!  I recommmend you download and play for fun.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love this show, and wanted my husband to watch with me, so he had a marathon of all three seasons..I purchased this on line so he could watch the shows in order. We had some taped and some on re runs. I was happy to pay a per episode price.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game has had me hooked from the very beginning. Love the puzzles and the hidden games also. Lots of fun!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|The original was great but then they added a video ad. Bad enough you have to deal with that but then the upgrade came out. Now it crashes for our five times in a row before it will finally start. Random crashes throughout the game. Not worth the trouble if they don't fix.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love pretty little liars! I usually take a long time to read books, but it was like I was transported into rosewood and was watching them with my own eyes!
B0082RHRHC|4.0|I really liked the human aspect of it and she had Jane not sugarcoat anything as to how she felt and told about things as she saw it. The only thing I didn't like was how long some of the conversations were but on the other hand sometimes it was important to what was happening in the story so all in all it was really good!
B00AH6CCK8|5.0|Awesome. Best ever. Listen to it everyday. I even bought the DVD. Love Metalica. Wish they would do it again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easiest way to stream content to TV. Once google gets more apps it'll be even better. 5 stars oh yeah
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Was a great movie, would recommend to all!<br />Really like the ending. Really good action film.<br />Would like to see a sequill.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is captivating! Love it! I don't typically play games on a regular basis but this one appealed to me right away.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is a great product and the shipping was fast. These are my favorite headphones and the only ones I use.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|Many funny moments and fun characters all but drown in the prolonged and wee bit too exaggerated ending . .  could have been nicely edited down by about 20 minutes.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was so interesting to see how all the players lives connected and how grief and secrets affect those around you. Definitely worth reading.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|If this show stays away from the typical &#34;will they or won't they&#34; premise, it will be without a doubt my favorite show, and I dare say more enjoyable than the BBC &#34;Sherlock&#34;
B002RV01QI|5.0|I've been an Enya fan for years! LOVE all her music. Always powerful, majestic, relaxing and breathtaking. I like her voice and how she sings.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|I only gave this movie 3 stars because while eveyrone gives a great acting performance the plot line was weak and vague.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I've been an Enya fan for years! LOVE all her music. Always powerful, majestic, relaxing and breathtaking. I like her voice and how she sings.
B006Z9K97E|5.0|This book enlightened me to the devastating truth of life in a North Korean prison camp. It left me in shock and with a feeling of uselessness because we cannot help or change their situation.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I'm not sure there's too much to say here. I really like that there's an included sharpening [stick thing] (I have no idea what it's actually called), as that helps with many kinds of edges that would be difficult to sharpen otherwise. Anyway, it works well, and that's all that needs to be said.
B003V4ASV8|5.0|The 5 stars say 'I love it'. It is impossible to 'love' this book. The story told is heartbreaking and true. It stays in your mind and you try to imagine what it was and IS like for those unfortunate people living in North Korea. An essential, educational read.
B000KIPT30|4.0|And I like it.<br /><br />For its price, this is an effective way to split a headphone signal four ways and not lose volume. The quality is ok, not great, and I'm sure some people would think it's bad. For the sake of this review, I'm thinking along the lines of the sound quality compared to the price. You get what you pay for. It's really that simple.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Such a great show and very enjoyable?  Great rainy day show to watch.  Never ger tired of watching this program
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Beautifully styled and almost tranquil, this game is easy to learn and provides a lot of fun elements as the levels advance.  Definitely more relaxing than challenging, but sometimes that is exactly what I want.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son loves this game.  I love this game.  I can't wait until I can get some some telepods for it.  Super Duper FUN!!
B0060QM09M|4.0|I've read all of Herriot's original paper books and loved them. Am currently re-reading their digital versions and asside from the occasional typo, seemingly ever-present in book-to-digital transfers, the books are still wonderful reads. Anyone with a love of animals, especially those with any background with 'vitnery' medicine, can truly appreciate these books.
B001UW58WW|5.0|One of, If not the most talented violinist ever! Absolutely beautiful new twists on popular music! I'm in love with his music!
B00F0AAC26|5.0|It's great to hear Costello return with such an assured, confident album, where his vocals are enhanced by the Roots' musicianship. The album has moments of trip-hop and sounds very contemporary. Costello at times has dug too deep into Americana and country, or wherever his fancy has taken him, but on this record he sounds vital, re-energized, and amazing.
B003O86MY8|5.0|One of, If not the most talented violinist ever! Absolutely beautiful new twists on popular music! I'm in love with his music!
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I hate this version! It is full of nonsense and horrible plot and acting. The crudeness of this movie is just sickening! The main character contradicts herself from the moment she steps into the Pride & Prejudice scene in fact the WHOLE movie is contradicting! Horrifying! I will never watch this again nor do I recommend it for anyone else, DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME!!
B0097BY3K6|5.0|One of, If not the most talented violinist ever! Absolutely beautiful new twists on popular music! I'm in love with his music!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Great game. Sucks to have to pay for coins instead of earning them. That is the only reason I rated 3 stars
B007HUD6OS|4.0|Great read!  Thought was very informative and showed how our local government works. Can't wait for the next book in this series!
B00DV3A84G|5.0|Excellent album!  Wonderful music and outstanding vocals.  Synthy/electro/indie/pop/rock type music - with a very unique sound.  The vocalist has a really beautiful voice.  I haven't been this excited about an album in quite some time.  Every track is great, I'd definitely recommend!
B0049J0CTM|1.0|I have a HD cable and TV but a laptop PC so couldn't stream in HD because of whatever Amazon restriction there is on not having an Xbox etc to stream HD...<br /><br />It looked like I was watching an atari 2600 at times, it was so pixelated. Audio was pretty poor.
0786958731|4.0|I really like this game! The only problem is the setup time which can be a tedious task. But overall, is a great board game!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie but the ending could have been better. Now about pricing. It was Better then redbox app on my roku, so that was awesome.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is a really fun game for me for several reasons. This game has great puzzles and very interesting stories that go along with with the puzzles. This is just a great game. I can't stop playing it.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|One time opportunity indeed. The music and performance are all perfect!!!! Ramin will always be my favorite phantom. Like the bonus in DVD!
B0000024YL|5.0|Hey, it's what it says. Simon & Garfunkel's Greatest hits. How can you go wrong? Good price and good music!
B0035HKWLW|1.0|I purchased this through Amazon instant video to play on my TiVo premiere box.  The instant video took hours to download (i have fios with a g router).  We eventually gave up waiting to download and watched it the next day.  The movie is 1:41 minutes.  After 1:20, the movie froze.  This was wasted money.  If Amazon can not figure this out, they should discontinue the service.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|Was really impressed with the detail of this toy especially considering the price. My grand nephew loved it! They only draw back is that it is plastic but if they're not going to try and ride in the back they will love that it looks real and dumps dirt!
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|This program looked great until I installed the large program. The first to fourth time I tried to play it my Kindle HD locked up. I had to jump out and remove it from the device and the cloud.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|It was in the free column but the game had coins you bought.<br />I erased it before the grandchildren found it and ran up a large bill on my credit card.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Great! Just what my son wanted. He was very happy. Thank you thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|To see the world through the burka headdress that women in Afghanistan must wear & be treated like animals in this male<br />dominated society is chilling.  This story of two women & how they handle their difficult circumstances, yet remain loving & kind<br />to each other & the children in the book is a testament to their strength & character.<br />After reading this book I found a new respect for the women that live under the control of these Islamist religious zealots.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just downloaded this Pinterest app to my tablet and so far I find it very user friendly. The graphics are clear with very good resolution.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app works just like it says it will. Very nice feature to have an alarm clock that doesn't drain the battery.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Who doesn't love the &#34;little guy&#34; whose been taken advantage giving it back to the &#34;big guy.&#34;  Matt Damon was so good as the novice lawyer. Danny DeVito was his usual caustic and funny self.  Mary Kay Place, the mother of a young man dying of leukemia, was so real in her performance displaying strength in the face if mistreatment and diversity.  Clare Danes was a quiet force that added to the story as a side story of itself. Again, another woman who pulls herself up by her bootstraps to face the &#34;demon&#34; of an abusive husband.  Danny Glover was so likable as the Judge in this court case I found my self smiling every time he smiled.  Jon Voight played the cold-hearted corporate lawyer so well…  The cast in this movie is amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My favorite card game and so easy on my Kindle Fire.  I can spend hours playing this game.  My grandkids love it as well
B004LQI0HE|5.0|A very provocative film that presents a subject that could be real in the not too distant future, farming humans for the purpose of donor organs.
B00DQVST76|4.0|I will keep this short. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the editing makes the concert look less like a concert and more like a music video. Madonna's face has been given special editing so that the lighting looks so bright you aren't able to see imperfections (which I am sure was the purpose). It does not look raw or real like a concert DVD should. The Sticky and Sweet and Confessions Tour DVDs weren't as heavily \\"Photoshopped\\" as this one.<br /><br />There are certain scenes where the camera angles could have been better to give a much more realistic feel to what the intention of the super large screens were meant to do in the live setting. I went to this concert in Phoenix, AZ and the screens are as much the star as Madonna is in certain performances. I don't know if this was done to make it less controversial since the backdrop gets bloody in a performance or what but it seems like a no-brainer to me to keep the spirit of that performance alive on the live DVD.<br /><br />All that being said, four stars is fours stars. That is still a stellar grade for a performance anyone is sure to enjoy. I don't believe it is in any way possible not to appreciate the artistry that goes in to this performance and, furthermore, it's just so fun and entertaining to watch. Another great thing to add in to my Madonna collection. Madonna should be proud.
B0033CTKHG|1.0|Not the right James Bond movie for young boys. The action was not enough to hold their attention. (We only rent the old James Bond because we don't want the crazy violence of the newer ones.)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Okay you can look up my reviews in all the other hunger games books marked under -Epic- but this one is by far the best!!!! Peeta does go a bit insane but the only real way to understand this book is by reading the whole series!!! You absolutely have to!!!!! My favorite is still peeta no matter what!! But warning this one is a lot more confusing... 5 stars always!! I have seen both movies and CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!! I just am obsesed with it!!!!!!! It's just my favorite series!! I love this even more than twilight or anything else!!!!! Read this now from book one!! But I must warn you you will not set your kindle down for a week!! That is me is started reading on Wednesday day the second book because the first one took the longest and then I had to buy the next one and stayed up reading all night till (not even kidding ) 2:30am!!!  (  ) :
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|These guys did a great job w asphalt 8. Fun game, great soundtrack. Definitely recommend to friends. I love this game
0897502027|5.0|I really Loved this book!!!! I can visualize and see were, Bruce was and is coming from.<br />I I'll reading this book, and other's with his knowledge.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I was not expecting it to be as good as it was, I did not know that Z stood for zombies.
B0086700CM|2.0|I play it all the time it's the best one at least out of the original version but I had not done any other kind of temple run but this is still good
B003U6BE8I|4.0|It got lost in a flood so I reordered it so I can have a complete set when the next one comes out. PJ and the Sea Monsters.
B00CVPAJ94|1.0|I don't know what it was about Silver Linings Playbook, but I just thought it was terrible and I can't put my finger on why.  People originally told me they felt that the film was a fantastic and accurate representation of bipolar disorder, but I myself have wrestled with a profound and debilitating case of bipolar for over twenty years and I do not give S.L.P. the same accolades.  I felt that it was unrealistic at best and patronizing at worst.  Cooper is a very talented actor, don't get me wrong; it wasn't his delivery I had a problem with.  Just as a house must have a strong foundation, the groundwork for any good film is its writing, way before any of the actors, props, and other details are fleshed out ... and the writing of S.L.P. left much to be desired.
B002JXK5VU|3.0|Convincing characters cast in roles that fit them well.  The science projects and phenomenas explored make you wonder what's really happening in the realm of government and extraterrestrial research
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Some unique action and character interactions got it to four stars.  I would have preferred to give three and a half.  The film really needed to be longer to encompass all that they wanted to include.  I imagine it was originally made longer but that the studio cut it down over the money issue.  Fewer people go to three hour films.  Nonetheless, it was still solid.
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|I bought this album fully expecting to hate it. The last Nine Inch Nails album I got was With Teeth. I didn't like that one at all. Sold it after one listen.<br />Hesitation Marks is a different sound but it works. Love the songs....love it all.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|So far, so good. I haven't had the app long enough to figure out how to minimize the ads, but this is a great YouTube player for the Kindle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great piece of work couldn't stop watching . Cast is wonderful . Every episode is challenging. Loved it aland watched it over agaun
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I thought it had a great plot.  The story kept moving without complete annihilation of all of the main characters. It showed human compassion, and the ugly side of humanity.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I haven't used it a lot and I'm not to sure about its search capabilities but its a nice and handy app to have with you.  It's on my phone so it is always with me.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I thought that the retelling of the Kahn Nunyoungsune was a bit redundant but they really did a switch aroo when what was expected to  happen didn't and what is shocking is that every one did a great job on the movie.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|I'm a huge Bowie fan, but this is an abomination. I had really high hopes and I've suffered through listening to this turd six times now hoping it would grow on me. Sadly it didn't. Really wish I could get my money and time back. Arguably the worst album he's put out.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|We enjoyed the sound and visual quality of the remastered version.  I would recommend it highly to all those that may seek.
B0035JNTA6|1.0|Honestly, I did not finish this movie. It was really that bad. Maybe if you hang in there, it gets better. I will never know.
0812550706|5.0|This book was really good. It was slow going at first, but towards the end it was really good. It was worth the read.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I did not think I would like this movie, but I really did. The special effects were amazing. I am now a Thor fan and will see the new one when it comes out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book will keep you turning the pages all day long. Highly recommend it to everyone that looks to spice their sex life.
B006BQM762|3.0|I lost interest in this one about half way through. Just your classic film when the government comes in, takes control, violates everyone's rights and so on. If you seen one, you seen them all.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have read three of Jojo's books.  This is the best. You feel like you are right there with the characters. It is so emotional and gives you so much to think about. Even the title  of the book is well worth pondering.
B0018OAOQC|5.0|Heard my first Volbeat song on Octane on Sirius XM, and haven't looked back.  Vocals, lyrics, drums, guitar - this group has it all. If you like hard rock, metal and a little rockabilly, this group - and album - is for you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is one of the best games that my family has ever played on the kindle.  Go Bingo Blitz!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I just got two of these at 35.00 great price...makes any tv with HDMI ports a smart network tv...i just have not had allot of time to really use it allot..but I think you are going to want one..
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever. Get this app. This is awesome!!!  Playing it all the time just like playing it on xbox. Watch for creepers Boom
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Dune by Frank Herbert is in my top five favorite books of all time because it is a love story set in a wondrous, imaginative world. One of my degrees is in anthropology, so I devoured the culture Herbert created for his books. The culture and setting are integral to the story so they are like characters to me, extremely engaging characters.<br /><br />Incredible book and the beginning to an incredible series!
B002E0JL4A|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie....I think the speech given by Patch to the medical board should be spoken at everyone's medical school graduation!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z by Max Brooks completely captivated me for an entire month. I loved the vignette device that Brooks used to make his world so believable, so  eerily real. Filtered through each subject's memories, these accounts gave us insight not only into the actual war itself, but also into the people supplying the tales. I read a few scenes each night so I could absorb the emotion in each one. I also dreamt about zombies every night, but that was probably to be expected.
B005SS2QXS|4.0|It's a great case and my iPhone is quite protected. Because it is rubber I do have a little trouble putting it in and taking my phone out if my pocket, but that's an insignificant problem. Overall I like the case and my favorite feature is that for the bottom there is a lot of space so that I can use all my accessories such as the dock for my stereo.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's a fun game but you have to keep paying to continue to play. That's not free! Come on, I'd rather pay an amount for continuous play time. I don't care about competing with others I just want to play Bingo.
B008133MDK|5.0|I just love this series! The subtle humor and throw away lines are simply marvelous ... excellent writers and director .. if you like British humor yer gonna love this one!  Trust me.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|One of my favorite Audrey Hepburn movies. Her classic grace and elegance is in full display. I should have bought the movie instead of just one day rental.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Handy to be able to recharge wile on the go. Nice to be able to recharge more than one way.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I have used this app for years and love it. Since the last update the search feature is freezing up and then I get a pop up that says the app has quit responding and FORCE close! Why is it doing this? I would give this program a 3 right now, before I would have given it a full 5 stars!<br />Frustrated
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is as good as any you will find published in the `regular` way.  It`s gritty and real.  A real page turner.  I blew through it in 5 days and wanted more.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a great show. The quality of the acting is superb and quite entertaining to delve into this period piece. I was hesitant at first with the season one but after the first show I was hooked! The costumes and sets are well done and the humor that is interjected is dry and a welcomed addition. My husband and I have enjoyed this so much we are going to start it all over and watch all 3 seasons again. Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|What a hard to follow waste of time.  Stopped the movie after only 30 min.  Very disappointing given the great actors
B00005O3VC|5.0|It was wonderful, so funny!!!  It was a gift for my husband and he laughed so much.....best present ever!!!  Great price too!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and was only able to find Season 3 on Amazon. I'd been watching Season 1 and 2 &#34;On Demand&#34; thru Comcast cable. Netflix didn't have season 3. Thank you, Amazon!!!
B00F91G5BS|3.0|SAME AS OTHER ZOMBIE MOVIES. SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GOOD. THE ENDING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPEND AFTER THE INVISIBLE DRUG.
B007BLCGNU|5.0|I bought this DVD for my daughter for Christmas so we have not opened it yet. However, it did ship in less than 3 days and that was super quick.
0812973992|5.0|This is a beautiful book. You will fall in love with unexpected characters and wonder what they're doing long after you finish the last page. McCann's writing is just exquisite.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|My Mom Brought Me This App Because I'm In love with it!<br />Give Me More Guns on This App!<br />Love' Jadon
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I started this book I just couldn't believe I was reading a book that was so slow starting.  I put it done numerous times just to come back and give it another chance.  Finally I had to ask friends about it and they said just wait keep reading.  So I did and OMG now I can't put it down.  Christian Grey yes he is a very tortured soul.  So glad that I kept reading and I am now into the 2nd book and still every waking hour reading.  A definite must read.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Overall, I think this book is worth reading if not simply just to have an opinion about a book that has been referenced too many times. I did enjoy reading most of the book and the ideas/dialogue is mostly well thought out.  However, the writing is often choppy and non-descriptive, leaving you to fill in many blanks.  I often had to reread many sections to understand the orientation/relation of the characters in the current scene. The fact that he has to describe actions in zero gravity doesn't help the situation, of course.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|What can I say? I'm a sucker for what Eastwood has been doing over the years. This did not disappoint.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Simply put, you need to read this book. It will make you reconsider many things, and make you a more thoughtful person; at least for awhile.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I have been a fan of the Walking Dead, and this is like an extension of that.  Awesome!  Pitt does an outstanding job as usual and the twist with the family was great.  I don't know how they got those swarms of zombies, but it was something else.  Highly recommend/
B004NS710C|5.0|It was interesting to see how small acts of carelessness leads to much bigger problems. Always love Denzel! Stellar performance!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|no complaints.  Takes care of all that I need from the application.  I would gladly recommend this application to someone else.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|A poignant story of love lost and found with a surprising ending! Another great Nicholas Sparks novel I think everyone will enjoy.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I could not put the book down, I am loving the whole series.  Would definitly recommend this book and the whole series.
B000MV90B2|4.0|not bad but dumb coukd have been much better, this was a turning point in our history, no more war 4 100 years
B001NLL93W|5.0|I could not put the book down, I am loving the whole series.  Would definitly recommend this book and the whole series.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Probably the best game I have played on mobile, Looking forward to future updates! No glitches what so ever! Highly recommended!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I could not put the book down, I am loving the whole series.  Would definitly recommend this book and the whole series.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|This woman has the most amazing voice.  I can't wait to hear more.  Some of the songs gave me goosebumps.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fell in love with every word of this book. Characters with personality & soul. I didn't just read the story, I felt it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app because it is so easy to use and big enough to read.  I would recommend this to all my friends.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Addicted to this one. The most played game on my Kindle and its free. The is improving as we go which keep it interesting.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I like boba fett and jango fett cause the missels are powerfull they blow up every thing in the way
B000667GFK|5.0|Miguel is a wonderful singer.  I love his singing so much!  This cd includes a lot of songs which I love and he sings them perfectly!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Really really liked this. I watched the 1st season on Netflix, and really enjoyed it, so I got the book. After reading several unfavorable reviews, I was a little putt off. However, after just finishing it, I'm saddened that I'm done. I think Ms Kerman is an excellent writer, able to bring me into prison with her. I just can't convey enough how much I liked this book :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good clean simple fun. Keeps me entertained for hours... But so do cat toys so maybe that isn't saying much.
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|The acting is non-existent.  Through all of the trials of Conan, this actor manages to portray about two moods well, and they get laughably overdone.  We get that he is brooding after the first scene of him as an adult, trapping him there perpetually, well...  The child actor that briefly played Conan's youth was the highlight of the film.  The girl antagonist is just as laughable.  There are people who can act fantasy so well that the story line becomes almost insignificant.  They transport you and can make any outlandish story &#34;believable.&#34;  Not the case here.  However, if you do not mind sitting back and watching a half naked man strut around hacking things for a couple of hours, the guy is hot.
068981528X|5.0|Loved this story about the big bad pig..my grandchildren loved it too....very nice and sweet story about a bad little pig.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I really liked this film, a lot, and I am not sure why.  It completely fed my science fiction action flick addiction for no particular reason.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|Not enough game play in this. They got the play style and feel right but the devs here missed half the fun of these games. A good one to learn from.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Acting is decent, special effects good, but nothing special.  A good one timer to rent if you like fantasy and science fiction - I say science fiction because their weapons are pretty unique.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|At first I thought this was going to be dumb, but it's a lesson in how to code for the touchscreen.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I was not anticipating really liking this film, I rented it to have some background noise while I was house cleaning.  I ended up sitting on the couch, duster in hand, enthralled.  All of the actors turned out a top notch performance.  The two boys were amazing. The story is unique, though I did not think from the trailer that it would be all that interesting.  This is a perfect case of a story that does not seem too interesting based on what is written, but the acting and plot twists add a level of unexpected drama that make it shine.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|The premise was good, the toys are gimmicky, and it's not pay to win. The power ups are gone but you can replace the birds and the pork side is a good way in increase content but I fear that may also drive down how much we see due to the dual layout of the levels forth comming.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I love all Allen films. Hemingway is my favorite author. Naturally, I found the idea of going back in time and falling in love entertaining.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I love this book it is interesting and amazing but lacks graphic explanations for little kids.My son is reading it and he is 6 years old
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Very nice, love the new characters and the menu is very responsiveness. Although I don't like the little blimp above the character that tells you what it does.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. I can't believe how it captures you from the first page. It's truly a work of art.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|If you are going to get this game just buy the full it doesn't give you a nuff time and you don't have of supplies
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|Can only take so much bad hero and this was way too much, a parody in fact.<br />Not worth the time.
0064431789|5.0|Can't go wrong with Where the Wild Things Are. Every child should have this story in their personal library. Kids love to act out the lines.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I was not thrilled with this game.  I did not find the challenge I was looking for.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for a fast moving game.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|Yes, it's glowy, it's hocky and it's fun.<br /><br />Not much more to say about it. I use my stylus to play it and not my fingers, and that seems to help it along. And it's fun to play in a dark room, if that's your flava.<br /><br />You can change the color of your paddle and the color of the puck.<br /><br />There are different levels of difficulty, and it's fun to change it up. (I think I actually played better with the harder difficulty.)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun. My 6 year old son loved it. Wasn't too hard or too easy. I got hooked on it and stayed up late playing it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love it! I have not finish watching it yet. I enjoyed watching it as I love all the characters especially Mary. The show is presented very well with no loose end. I find myself watching some of the episodes a few times before I move on to the next one as it is so beautiful to watch too.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a great story for people of all ages. I like to read this every year or so as it gives me a boost of energy.  It's a nice book about what is possible when we humans put our minds to something.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book by a great author glad I found it to read it on my upas because iBooks doesn't carry it
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Fantastic story - but you really should read the first of the Clifton Chronicles before this one. As always, Archer ends on a cliff-hanger!
B0046ECFRM|4.0|Anna and the French Kiss was one of those books that I've seen around a lot but never sat down and read. For some reason (and I really have no idea why this is) I am not drawn to \\"destination\\" books. I know, I know. I'm totally missing out on some amazing books, but I'm just never excited to read those books. However, I saw an author on Twitter talking about how good Anna and the French Kiss is so I decided to give it a try. AND I LOVED IT! This book is so sweet, and romantic, but also has substance. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I like Anna a lot. She definitely isn't perfect, and makes quite a few mistakes throughout the story. But I was never sitting around rolling my eyes at her or thinking \\"What in the world, girl, get your crap together.\\" All of her mistakes and bumps in the road are honestly things that we all do. We all forget to put ourselves in other people's shoes, and we all react without thinking sometimes. Anna is human; she's just like you and me. I loved walking in her shoes, and experiencing Paris for the first time. I loved living her life and fears, and learning how to overcome them. But I mostly loved experiencing first love through her eyes.<br /><br />That brings us to &Eacute;tienne. And to steal a line from the description, Smart, charming, beautiful, &Eacute;tienne. There were times I wanted to yell at him, and times that I just wanted him to go away so he would stop hurting Anna, but the little booger is charming and I couldn't help but love him. &Eacute;tienne would have been the perfect book boyfriends, except he was kinda a crappy boyfriend. He handles the whole Ellie/Anna situation horribly and so many times I wanted to smack him upside the head. But in the end he removed his head from you-know-where and proceeds to do the right thing.<br /><br />I adored everything about this book. The setting, the characters, the romance. It was a great contemporary romance and I am now about to go read Lola and the Boy Next Door. That will set me up for Isla and the Happily Ever After, which I am so excited about!the Happily Ever After, which I am so excited about!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Be open to miracles as you read this book and participate in these fun experiments. You have nothing to lose, right? And everything to gain. Expect the best and thats all you will get. As adults sometimes we forget to play. The essence of this book is play and the incredible energy that exists within us and the universe. It all starts with imagination and play. So dive in and remember what's right!!!!
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Wow, it's crazy to think that we are already twelve books into the Psy-Changeling series. What's even crazier is that they are still so freaking amazing. How Nalini Singh keeps up the awesomeness one book after another is a mystery. Some many series start to lose steam this far into a series, but the Psy-Changeling series is still just as good as book one.<br /><br />So I'm just going to assume that everybody reading this review already knows who Ghost is, so if you don't know and don't want to be spoiled PLEASE TURN AWAY.<br /><br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian is Kaleb and Sahara's story. Yes, Kaleb finally got his HEA. From the first time Kaleb stepped into the Psy-Changeling world I wanted to believe that he was \\"good\\". While Kaleb is definitely not good good, he's semi-good. Well, maybe not semi-good, let's just say that he isn't awful.<br />From the beginning you know that there is something seriously off about Kaleb. That he must have a bajiliion secrets and that he has seen awful things. I never expected one of those secrets to be Sahara. I don't want to go too into because I was everybody to experience their relationship themselves, but Kaleb and Sahara's relationship is so beautiful.<br /><br />In many romance books, it doesn't matter the genre, we see a lot of lust and sex. That's fine, I mean it is \\"romance\\" but very rarely do we get to see a relationship as beautiful as the one in Heart of Obsidian. Kaleb and Sahara save each other, but in different ways. There is such a depth of emotion that it's sometimes hard to read.<br /><br />Romance isn't the only thing going on in Heart of Obsidian. This is the book where everything that's been brewing in the previous eleven books come to a massive explosion of events. Nalini wraps up a lot of different storylines that have been developing over the past books, and it was nice to see some type of conclusion developing.<br /><br />With that being said, I think none of us are ready for this series to end, and it doesn't look like it is. Book thirteen, featuring Vasic, is currently being written, and a novella will be released in 2014. As far as I'm concerned Nalini can keep writing this series forever. Heart of Obsidian is proof that she still has a lot of idea, and these characters still have a lot of story to tell.this series to end, and it doesn't look like it is.

B005LAII4E|3.0|Overall it was mildly entertaining, maybe not as much as the first movie. I am sure I would have rated it higher in my younger years.
0385512058|4.0|Good physical quality and content for very affordable price. It arrived on time too. A must read book for those who want to succeed
B00F35BV64|5.0|A remake with a twist I really enjoyed this movie. This is a movie you go back and watch again and again.

1594745692|5.0|Great deck. Good play on changing Pentacles to Hazards. Fun art work. Retro feel for modern issues. Unfortunately no recipe cards.
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|the most i liked about the author's style was the fact that she asked many questions and had the reader think .
B005LAIIN0|5.0|A friend of mine recommended the book a while back, and I was skeptical as I don't usually like the story telling format employed by the book.  Nevertheless, it was a powerful well written book.  Again, not my favorite story telling style - but it is so well done that I am glad I read it.<br /><br />When I they announced the movie I was even more skeptical.  The good news is the movie isn't the book.<br /><br />What you have instead, is an excellent blockbuster style movie that is based on the events described in the book - but adapted (I.e. changed) - for a story more suited for being told in a  cinematic style.<br /><br />I rate this as tied for the best zombie movie - my other number one pick being 28 Weeks.  The movies have very different approaches, but both succeed in portraying the horror of zombies - while getting you to care about the characters and what happens to them.  Of the two, WWZ is more upbeat - thought neither is a happy movie.  Basically it comes down to how the movie ends.  More positive than the closing scene in 28 weeks.<br /><br />What elevates Z above most fare is the sacrifice of various characters and the effective portrayl of the wrenching events and decisions that people are forced into.  Without using a huge amount of gore, you get that this is a cataclysm.  Also, Brad Pitt's character is an intelligent, thinking participant in finding a solution that \\"may\\" allow humanity to survive.<br /><br />This movie isn't the book - but it is very true to the spirit of the book.  And the ways that it deviates from the book - a more linear story, more action focused, centered on a single character and the people he runs into - make for a better movie.<br /><br />Having seen the movie - I'm glad they told this story.  The book would have been almost impossible to pull off, likely resulting in a disappointing experience.<br /><br />This is an excellent film, that happens to be about zombies.  And it is a film that holds true to the spirit of the bookwhile telling its own story.  Both are highly recommended and well worth the purchase.
0802473156|5.0|We bought this as a wedding gift. In fact, it's what we give to everybody for a wedding gift. It's a GREAT book for understanding what your spouse needs to feel loved. I would highly recommend it to every person in any type of relationship. It works with your kids, too! It saves marriages. I can't say enough about it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun game. Love it and want to play it all the time. Even when I should be doing homework.
B00EZZ9W3C|4.0|first off this c.d. just released in The united states on 17 september. so I had to wait while fans in Europe brag about how great it was on facebook,youtube etc nevertheless finally got it.Greg dont ever stagger the releases again..the album is great its what you expect from Gregory P. Ive only had it for 5 days so the review is a little premature. I dont think it is as good as his other 2 but its definitely a dope c.d.. I think if I wouldve heard this c.d. as a introduction to G.P. without hearing the other two I wouldve rated it higher. I saw him in chicago last year I can t wait to see him perform this c.d.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Since I'm a cat lover, I was intrigued by the reviews. The relationship of the author & bob was mutually life saving.  Bob was an extraordinary cat & quite entertaining.  A great read
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this Bingo Game.  Best one I have found.  Very addicting.  From the beginning you have the option of trying more than one Bingo/Slots room.  You also get to participate in five daily Bingo tournaments for free.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is one of the harder hidden object games I have played.  It is also timed, with no way to turn off the timer, but it is still fun.  I play a little here and there.  You don't have to buy anything if you are willing to wait for your energy to recharge and don' t mind repeating levels if you are out of clues.
B00BMNM4H6|2.0|I thought this game would be fun but it's boring and did not enthuse me at all. Do not recommend
B006JPS1OM|5.0|i love these games...works my brain and entertains...what more can one ask?  Good for most ages...and teaches great observation skills,  following directions.
B00DL7TSAM|5.0|it was a gift for my niece, and she's been so glad to get it!<br />&#34;Oh! Amazing! she said, it's a very beautifull item! &#34;(she collects many things about Michael Jackson)
B005LAII80|5.0|I haven't read the comic but have seen the 1995 film. I enjoyed it for what it was. This film, on the other hand, is very violent, to-the-point, and lacks obvious humor. Great actors, incredible set design, and focused. It almost has an episodic feel to it. I wish the film would have done better at the box office ($35M budget/$13.4M gross) so that sequels could be made. I would love to see more stories with Karl playing Dredd. I just read on IMDB that \\"The original script for a Judge Dredd film was written back in the early 80s but was altered and changed so much it became the first Robocop film and the Dredd film was shelved.\\" This explains my title I guess. Interesting...
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|It wanted me to finish the book. Wanted to know if he really was innocent or was he really lieing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for horse lover's. Highly recommended. I love the graphics. Also a great game for younger kids that are in love with horses.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|it is a realllly fun game I would recommend it for anyone who likes mystery games and adventure keep on gaming
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|This show keeps you guessing on how the plot will come out.  Who gets exposed for what.  The reason I like shows like this...no yucky dead body scenes but plenty of action.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love spider solitaire ! It is the best 😜<br />I really recommend it to everyone! It is addictive!  Love it.
1434102750|1.0|I found no real insight or wisdom in this slim volume of poorly spelled, grammatically incorrect, carelessly thrown together assemblage of crusty, stale advice.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Good! Recommend for a long weekend. Hard to put down. In-depth characters and plots. I loved the way it tied together at the end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent final book to the Hunger Game Series!  Suzanne Collins did not disappoint with this 3rd in the series. I wish there would have been more!
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Does not support Nook Simple Touch. It is very expensive. You can get apps that cost you nothing that do better than this one.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Easy light and fast... Christopher's story rolls along like the runners he profiles bounding between scientific research and a frolicking adventure. The hardest part of reading the book was not stopping to go run!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|They wern't kidding you can tell a difference.  I have the first two on DVD, and have watched them more times than I'd like to admit,  but when I put in the first Blue Ray, wow!  What a significant difference.  This is not true for all Blue Ray movies. I would HIGHLY recomend this to any fan of the Alien series.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|This is still on of our favorite movies of all time, a must see!<br /><br />Great date night movie, put it in, sit back and enjoy~
B00A285OOW|5.0|What jumped out in this book, for me, was the insecurity and irrationality of Henry VI.  He is not a loveable character - but then, how many leaders are?  His dependence on his mother, Margaret Beaufort, is staggering and he takes too long to put on his &#34;big boy pants&#34; and break the umbilical cord.  Meanwhile, his bride, Elizabeth, faces challenges that would break a weaker woman.<br /><br />Extremely well written, as we've come to expect from Philippa Gregory, this is not a &#34;happily ever after&#34; book (or series, for that matter), but it is very interesting and informative.  I've enjoyed every book in the series and will probably re-read them at some poinnt.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|So far, I am loving this app! It allows me to use other languages and you can adjust your settings so that it remembers what you type on fb, or e-mails. You can pick your own settings. Makes texting a lot easier!
B00464CU7M|5.0|That voice!  Perfect setting and amazing sets and dancers in the background to make the music come alive.  Unique in a Sarah Brightman way (and I adore Sarah!).
031623480X|5.0|I read Wheat Belly last year and liked it, so when I saw this book on Amazon I preordered it because I knew I had to read it.  And I am glad I did.  In a nutshell, the author explains the difference in macronutrient ratios that the prehistoric diet had vs. the current diet and all of the problems that resulted.  He talks about LDL and how it affects the brain, and after reading this book I am almost certain that statins are a sham.  He explains that it's not high LDL that is the problem, but instead LDL can get messed up with glucose and when it gets distorted like that you end up with problems.  When that happens, it does not deliver nutrients to the brain.  Statins reduce LDL which can reduce your cognitive ability.  He suggests that the modern diet that typically has 60% of calories from carbs is a huge problem and recommends the keto diet in the book.  He makes a good enough case for it, and after reading it I have been convinced to embark on a keto diet.  But I don't feel 100% comfortable enough to do that with reading this book alone, so I bought another book to help with that (which I have yet to receive).  So I shave off a little of what would be 5 stars since I don't think this book totally could prepare me for that.  I also shave off a little more because he doesn't advocate that hard for being grain or dairy free towards the end of the book, but in the beginning he mentions that gluten is bad and many people should be casein free as well.  So it seems like that message got diluted along the way.  Since I'm dairy free and gluten free (and plan on becoming grain free but am still working on that) I can't make use of a lot of his recipes.<br />So, I can't say this book is perfect.  But after reading it I have a much greater understanding of LDL, and what to do with my diet in the big picture.  This book has been really helpful and I recommend it to anyone.  But I don't recommend the recipes necessarily.<br /><br />Update: I looked through the recipe sectionof the book again and decided I should be a little more specific. 11 of the recipes have dairy which is about 25% of the recipes.  He also encourages cooking with butter and pouring cream on berries.  Some of the recipes could be made without the dairy (but not all of them), but it gives me the impression that dairy is encouraged even though he mentions earlier in the book that 50% of gluten-sensitive people may have dairy sensitivities too.  So it just rubs me the wrong way how dairy gets pushed at the end.  As far as grains go, he suggests half a cup of rice as a side dish with fish as the entree but only one recipe had grains (chickpeas for the hummus).  IMO if you are dieting in this manner, I would not recommend rice as a side dish so that just ruffled my feathers a bit.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I got this game because I wanted to play and collect animals, and that is what this game gives you. I wouldn't recommend  it for little kids, but for kids ages 7-15.
B000FA6720|5.0|SHE HAS READ IT THREE TIMES...<br />WE READ IT AGAIN ON COMPUTER...<br />ALSO GOT THE MOVIE FROM NETFLIX...<br />SONNY AND PEARL...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for season 4. My wife and I don't watch a lot of TV together but this show pulled us in. We would finish an episode, look at each other, then start another one! Sad we are out of episodes. Great writing, intriguing characters, amazing sets and costumes.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|I was browsing and saw the PSB had a new release, and I've always been a fan. I've bought the albums, imports, remixes and the DVD's, although, a few of their last  albums (Elysium, Fundamental and The Most Incredible Thing) had me very worried that they were fizzling out, especially since they had a brief reawakening with both \\"Yes\\" & the \\"Christmas\\" ep (2009), which, to me, was their best work since \\"Nightlife\\" (1999), I really liked \\"Love etc.\\" (Yes) & \\"Viva la vida/Domino dancing\\" (Christmas), which successfully merged/fused two great songs together. Anyway, I am SO GLAD that I've kept the faith because I haven't been this enthusiastic about one of their albums since \\"Very\\" (1993), and this has the same energy and style, but it's even better.<br /><br />\\"Electric\\" is great. My favorite tracks instantly are: \\"The Last to Die\\", \\"Love is a Bourgeois Construct\\", \\"Axis\\" and \\"Vocal\\", which reminds me of their classic \\"It's Alright\\", but with way more energy. I also just bought the remixes for  \\"Vocal\\" and, like usual, their remixes never fail..<br /><br />It seems to me, that like with most artists, once the PSB, broke free of their huge corporate constraints (Parlophone), they're free to do what they do best - great music.. Not to say they haven't been making great music all along, but every track on this album is solid and reminds me of their first fifteen years. I am so glad they are still going strong. Now if only Depeche Mode were this good again.. I'm just sayin'..  BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B005LAII80|5.0|Based on a little-known comic, rebooting a widely reviled 90s movie, with C-list actors and a small budget for an action film.  Yet this movie is absolutely phenomenal.  Great action, great performances, and it leaves you wanting to see more of this world.  Highly recommended.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Will be looking out for more from this author. Totally had me spellbound. Didn't want it to end.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was really pleased with this offering from George RR Martin.  I hope that when this series is completed, that they can go back and mix books four and five together.  The print medium just doesn't have books long enough for this story.<br /><br />The intrigue, suspense, and action all pick back up in this volume--especially after we pass the point in the book where all of the characters are being shown.<br /><br />Martin is back in form with this novel, and it is every bit as enjoyable as the early volumes.  I can't wait for book six!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I Love the story and I can't wait for the next season. It's nice to see how the other half lived in that time period.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|This movie about a retirement home for musicians is chocked full of delightful moments with wonderful actors. It will never be mainstream because of the lack of svelt young performing violence or sex. However, it is a decent story about people facing the lives they have lead and is acted very well including an as usual strong performance by Maggie Smith.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I like the author's style- direct and funny! I continually choose books that mirror Who I Really Am, to keep me creating from a place of joy and confidence. This is a super mirror! Give it to family and loved ones who might be interested in living their own highest possible lives.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|This movie was ok.  I liked it better than #3, but it did not have as many creepy scenes as the first 2.  Just when it finally starts to get good and suspenseful it totally ends suddenly and you see the black screen with the credits!
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book. Everyone just raved about this book so I got it. A great price too. This was worth getting.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Finally, a show that can make us all laugh, without any coarse humor or inappropriate jokes! So clever and funny!
B0056C6XIA|5.0|To be frank, If I had nothing on me but this in the wild... Id be set.<br />Multitool is sturdy all attachments are solid, rigid and Razor sharp. best features all the bear series gear is that rubber grips that comes with the products. Ives used this tool on my engine, tubes, after exposure to water and have yet to have it slip. few other multitools can offer that.<br />The flashlight is bright small enough to carry in your pocket (movies, fitting in small crevices etc).<br />The Fire striker is phenomenal. ive tested several other fire makers- magnesium bars, piston driven, etc and none have been able to light tinder on the first strike.... controlled forwards spark instead of &#34;firework&#34; spread.<br />Im an avid hiker and will NEVER leave home without this setup.<br />Beautiful compliment with the bear grylls ultimate knife pro and hatchet,<br />the case is extremely durable and will drain water. the holster for the items snap in for added closure.<br />YES the holsters fits on a chest rig and plate carrier loops.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|One of the hottest books in a long time. It makes you feel like your  becoming  involved<br />in their lives. You will love the most impressive and gratifying way Sylvia Day brings  them together. I can't wait until the next page-turner  becomes  available.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I tried this app because the Weather Channel app I had been using had ticked me off for the last time with pop-ups that stalled my search for quick weather info that I need for work.<br />AccuWeather has more that fill the needs I have. All kinds of info and options. I highly recommend it.<br />No pop-ups yet either.
B006S086AM|4.0|kinda makes you think, nice it was based in the 80's.  kinda romantic comedy genre.  zombie land minus the zombies and woodie harrelson.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|I love this subject matter but struggled with the nautical lingo. Now on the Kindle I can check for definitions quickly and it makes it more enjoyable for an non sailor like me to read. Great book and I am looking for ward to the next one in the series.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It was even better than I had anticipated! I knew it would be good, but this was really worth the wait.
B008AS5UAO|5.0|Great singing great ensemble - this is a top of the line performance- whether this is your first recording or one of many you should hear this one.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|I think this could have been a good movie but just the annoying Vegas magic show music alone made it a turn off.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|Very beautifully written. Love the inner dialogue of all the characters. Armande is a favorite. I just loved her spicy attitude.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Loved the first one, loved this one, hope they continue!!! Chris Pine is awesome as Captain Kirk! The whole cast is great!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I made a new book rule for myself: REFRAIN (or at least try) FROM PEEKING AT REVIEWS PRIOR TO READING.  I did that because I realized that if too many people rated a book a certain way, it would alter my expectations of the book and well, that's not really fair is it? However, when it came to Tangled, I cheated and sneaked a peek anyway.  In this case, I was rather glad that I did.  I had received a copy of this book courtesy of Omnific during BEA 2013 and I didn't know anything about this story.  From what I had seen, there were many mixed reviews.  Some people gushed & raved and some others just couldn't deal with Drew - and this only increased my curiosity.<br /><br />I delved into this book fully expecting Drew to be a chauvinistic, self-centered douche-canoe.  What I did not expect was for him to make me laugh as much as he did.  While I am typically not a fan of jerks, I did appreciate that he was honest about it.  He knew he wasn't \\"boy next door\\" material and he made no apologies for it.  Frankly, while I can understand how much of what he said is considered disrespectful and demeaning, I actually found it hysterically funny.  Maybe I simply have a guy's sense of humor or I've been married to one for too long but I thoroughly enjoyed my journey through the male mind.<br /><br />Character development is a big deal for me.  It's so incredibly gratifying to read about a character like Drew fall madly in love and be humbled by a woman.  Our female lead, Katherine, is exactly the type of woman who could bring him down.  She's strong, intelligent, hard-working, determined, professional, and empowered.  She's also classy, likes to have fun and doesn't mind getting down and dirty.  She matched Drew step-for-step and she wasn't seduced by him but rather allowed him to seduce her.  You go girl!  The ending was sweet and exactly what I hoped it would be.<br /><br />The narrative was original and unique.  While some had issues with it, I found it refreshing.  You are introduced to Drew during his low-point and from there, he proceeds to tell us about how he got there.  It's first-person primarily told in the form of flashbacks blended with his own insights and witticisms until the story catches up to the present and then you move forward with him.<br /><br />STRONG HEROINE + CHEEKY PLAYBOY + HILARIOUS BANTER = A light, entertaining, charming, and sexy read!<br /><br />However, I do recommend you proceed with caution if you are sensitive to certain language and/or crass tongue in cheek humor.troduced to Drew during his low-point and from there, he proceeds to tell us about how he got there.

B0026OR1UK|5.0|Everyone has wasted time trying to perfect something in our lives. Golf, a musical instrument, sports, diets, etc.. This book brings into perspective the balance of what is required to hone in on what it really takes! No magic pill, no Magog piece of equipment and no master plan with all the key elements outlined for you so you don't have to do anything! Read this for the code!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Awesome!  Jesse and Walter's dysfunctional relationship keeps evolving with every episode.  It will be fascinating to see where the writers take their relationship in the final two episodes of the series.  Great cinematography.

B005DD7MH8|5.0|I've watched this over and over again. Who wouldn't want a four digit IQ? I know I would.<br /><br />I saw what I considered to be a couple of plot anomalies though. One was that if he was doubling his money every day, he could have multiplied it by at least 1024 times in just ten more business days. If he was willing to wait for twenty more business days, he would have multiplied his money by 1048576 times. To me, that seems more than fast enough. If he was starting out with a few thousand dollars, he could easily have been a billionaire without borrowing any money from the greedy thug. Of course, that would have made the movie enormously different and not nearly as dramatic. He wouldn't have needed to have anything to do with Carl Van Loon either. And $40,000,000 after two months (42 or 43 business days) work? Aside from market reaction, he could have multiplied his money by approximately 7.9668296 * 10^12 times. Obviously, the writer's ideas on the mathematics of exponential growth left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />I've known, admired, and envied some very intelligent people in my time, and I wished I could have thought of the same things they did. While I guessed that their IQ's were at least a couple of standard deviations higher than mine, I can scarcely imagine what a four digit IQ would be like. And that brings me to my next anomaly.<br /><br />Assuming he got a five times (from 20% of his brain to 100% according to Vernon Gant and \\"It works better if you're already smart.\\" -- so I guessed an IQ of about 130, otherwise Eddie Morra's down and out writer character would not have been plausible) multiplication of his IQ, that would probably have taken him to about 650. To get to 1000 (the lowest four digit IQ), his mental metabolic rate probably would have had to have been stepped up to about 1.54 times it's normal level too. That seems a bit implausible as well given that Vern spoke only of an access boost. But, in contrast to what I just said, his ex-wifeMellisa said she quit because she was afraid of burnout, so perhaps there could have been a mental metabolic increase after all.<br /><br />Everything considered, flaws and all, this was a very engaging movie and well worth the purchase. No buyer's remorse here, I'm glad I bought it.

1416595236|5.0|I'm not one to read espionage-type books. But my book club picked this book to read. Much to my surprise, I LOVED it. I couldn't get enough of Mitch Rapp. The story moved along at a great pace, the characters were engaging, and the story line seemed realistic.<br /><br />I liked it so much, I purchased 2 more of Vince Flynn's books. I'm very sad to hear that he passed away a few months ago.
0425263924|5.0|Super sexy book. I liked it better than the second one. I look forward to the next Eva/Cross book. Great Book!

B0036S4B6M|4.0|I bought this book after devouring back to back to back episodes of the Netflix show.  Thing is, the show takes A LOT of artistic license to create fascinating characters and tension and to make a hum-hum story a lot more interesting.  Still, this book is based on real life events and the fallout that bad choices can have years after the fact.  The narrative is very honest and heartfelt and the accounts of life inside the prison walls is equal parts emotional, sensitive and scary as hell.  I still like the show better and can't wait for season 2 when they'll &#34;make up&#34; more stuff to keep us at the edge of our seats... but this is still a very good book and well worth every page.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A ton of action and a more realistic view of what a Zombie apocalypse would actually look like. Wish there was a little more action at the end. Overall, a great movie.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Clearly shows the links between corporate marketing (shorter term bu powerful and the longer term health effects).  Makes it hare to snack while reading this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was an awesome game!!! Try it out!! I love it so much &lt;3 the minion game reminds me of temple run and subway surfer
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|This game is fun and challenging, with lots of fun pirate action. But eventhough is free to download. once you start playing it can get expecive,cause to advance you need to get this jewels and even though you get some in the beginning for free you used them up then you have to buy some thru amazon.
B007JMW46U|5.0|This is a good selection of Sherlock Holmes stories with nice illustration. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle way of writing is always good entertainment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It teaches kids how to take care of a horse and my daughter loves it!!! She can play it for hours at a time and never get bored!!
B00DPKQ60A|3.0|Ariana is not that much of a sing because most of her songs are just moaning . I like her song but, i dont like her vioce.
B0000A118M|4.0|This was a gift.  We were a little surprised at how short the performance was, but other than that, excellent, as expected.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is fantastic.  I've been interested in the Laws of Attraction for ages but have found most books almost put the blame back on you if things aren't going right.  This book seriously makes it easy to understand and to change your thinking.  It makes sense. There's no gobbledygook in it.. It's straightforward and simple.  You'll love it.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Bulky when not in use. Good sound quality. Circular wire holder is a pain - Need better way to handlen wires for charging. It also takes too much room on my desk and the way the wires are arranged to go through the circular wire holder is ridiculous. I normally leave the headset charging overnight on the desk when I don't have to work around it. This is a poor design. Mostly use the headset with the key plugged in until it totally discharges because it is so cumbersome when charging. Unfortunately, it doesn't stay charged long enough so I have to watch to make sure I won't have to charge while I am working at my desk or suffer the space problem - Otherwise Logitech usually makes a decent product. I would have sent it back, however, if I had to charge it with the rather ridiculous way you need to do it, but the quality of the sound and such is very decent, so I am keeping it. - Come on Logitech, figure out another way to make the charging less of a PIA
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Fast paced zombie movie. on occasions story moving too fast and became little confusing. Different spin then other zombie movies. overall well done without too much blood gore.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun and it is good for math skills and is very fast I play it allthe time
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love this Star Trek movie.  I loved the story line and loved seeing the old Star Trek series features added to the movie.  Great fun!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Great set of tools! iFixit is a great website to support. Only wish the pentalobe screw bits were labelled a bit more clearly.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I sat on the edge of my seat for the entire movie. Action packed and certainly holds your attention. Scary fun.
0385486804|3.0|Cool to read and still reading , like it so far , I still need to read the end ok
B0000AK7AC|4.0|Cromwell does a wonderful job, not talking.  The pig and narrator do it all for him.  This is a family flick that can be watched by all ages and multiple times.  Wonderful story line and great ending.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I love Angry Birds, period.  Star Wars has been one of my favorites and now it's even better.  The only &#34;down side&#34; I would say is, (for me anyway) getting that 3rd star seems impossible.  Games shouldn't be frustrating, but this version is a little testy for me.  I play it on my Kindle Fire, which makes the images much smaller to it's harder to see and maybe on a PC screen it would be a little easier as is Angry Birds with Friends.  Either way, I still love the characters and the catapults!  Very challenging, but love it anyway!  Onk, onk!
B00EHAIHWM|5.0|It's authentic but new and fresh. Kept the same great sound without going all dance / electronic. I love it.
B001NLJ33K|5.0|Collin Farrell and Jamie Fox are great in this movie. They make a great Crocket and Tubbs in a modern day remake with out the cheese commonly associated with the 80s.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Very good record from Bon Jovi! Glad I got it. Thanks so much for making it easy to order & everything.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I was surprised how fast they jump into action compared to most zombie movies. From that point the movie delivers action that keeps you on your seat.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I've read a few detective novels, and they all seem to have a similar formula: something happens, somebody's suspected, somebody else is guilty. While that is true in many of Holmes's adventures, there is so much more! Each story is humorous (in a subtle, somewhat dry way) and engaging. I immediately identified with Watson and couldn't wait to hear the resolution of each case.<br /><br />This is NOT like the movie, and is only somewhat like the tv shows. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|This was such a good movie. It was sad and funny at the same time. I am not from the south, but it made me ashamed of those that indulged in this behavior.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I know this show is supposed to be a children's show, but the Doctor is one of the most innovative, imaginative, fun rides on television.  It was suggested to me, and since I have started watching it on my Kindle, I have become addicted,
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|My husband and I both liked this movie very much. Action packed!! Keeps you interested from beginning to end. Let's see a second.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Cute movie and great HD quality picture. My kids love this movie. A classic for sure. You won't regret this purchase!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|If you aren't looking to upgrade for a few years this is a great pick, it's excellent for rendering and gaming, socket 2011 is Intel's enthusiast socket and it does not disappoint.
B00CJGP116|5.0|It is full of great music, I recommend it to any one that likes great salsa music with meaning. Outstanding CD.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book. Excellent..why there is a movie being made. Read it as soon as possible!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Fun game. Puzzles follow a thoughtful process that makes sense unlike some canes. Great graphics and very entertaining. Definitely worth the money.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time! And I ha e to say I absolutely loved the twist to it. Pure awesomeness!!!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I like this story. And, I suppose I thought the movie was well done for the story line it's telling. It's brutal and to think otherwise would be insensitive to that part of it. I still like the story line.
B001GPTC1Q|5.0|A touching beautiful story about a lonely ape and how a woman can survive by using her vaudeville talents and passion to escape his jungle. The special effects were amazingly real to me as was my 9 yr old grandson. The end of the movie was so sad that we agreed not to watch it again!! But I still have 2 more grandkids, younger, and will probably watch it again in a few years!!! Congratulations!!
B0036OS3M4|4.0|Very good quality, exact size, very confotable, yet reasonably priced, in short the purchased product meets my expectations of price / quality
B00BESM14U|3.0|The ending was a little out of left field but it was a movie worth watching if less than $3
0893860468|4.0|I'm only a veep pages intoi it, but, after reading Deepok Chopras Brotherhood/Karma,it extended the enjoyment.  I reall y have enjoyed many of his earlier books.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I think their 1st season was probably their best.  They were finding their way backwards from the 60's star trek very commendably.  In the 2nd season when Florida was ravaged the thrust of the show took a diversion they could not seem to shake.  Had they kept the wonder of discovery in the show instead I think it would have lasted longer.
1863514260|5.0|It is a well organized book , contains inspiring samples , in brief, an excellent teaching tool for any instructor of<br />Needlepainting
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Purchased this product to convert a couple carousels of old slides. Great results for the money. You may get better results having them professionally converted to digital, but if you have more than 20 or 30 to do this is a good value.<br />Not the speediest device but it wasn't 1200.00 either.<br />I have not used this for negative scanning yet; mechanism seems a little cumbersome for more than a few dozen.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Enjoyed thoroughly.  The book kept me interested and I loved the characters. I had a hard time putting this book down.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|everything about this movie is bad. everything.<br />its not even fun to make jokes about.<br />you will have more fun hitting your thumb with a hammer the watching this move.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good show.. did not know what to expect when started season but after pilot I was hooked. Give it a view.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found it a great read, interesting plot. It held my interest throughout from beginning to end. The sex sprinkled throughout was toned down, which was good for me it had started to get mundane. I loved the intrigue and suspense. It was a great love story!
B00F2362IE|1.0|This app will not download on my kindle fire. What a waste of four dollars. My son  is very disappointed.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Very if any plot - just shoot em up - again, again and again.  Shame there are few if any movies being made today.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|My Daughter loved this movie and so did my wife and I.  Its fun and teaches a good lesson.<br />Not your typical silly kids movie.
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|i give it two stars because it kept me entertained for 20 minutes, then the garage sized holes started to appear in the the story. talk about a credulity stretcher.  star wars is like a non-fiction work compared to this head scratcher, every turn is so over the top and outlandish.  if they would have been a bit more subtle and unpretentious it could have been more deft, but the conceits are so ridiculous they strike nausea.  marvel superheros have less to prove then these outrageously drawn buffoons, thumbs down
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this every day.I love seeing things other people pin and will repin a lot of things.I see lots of cats and art and even cat art.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is hard but fun. It's frustrating though because you run out of levels. Otherwise, pretty fun/difficult. Get this app if you are good at mystery stuff or like hard things.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really like Clean Master. I have it on my Kindle, Phone and Computer. It's simple and cleans my stuff like a pro!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I downloaded it because a co-worker mentioned using it. I have never liked Onenote in my PC and needed something. the notetaking is just what you'd expect, no great insights. but I really like that I can open up my computer, make a note, be in my car and add to a note from my phone and then if a thought hits me at home, just pick up my kindle and they are all synced.<br /><br />I don't need the constant &quot;evermore is synced&quot; notice popping up on my Pc, thanks.And its interface with Kindle seems weaker than the other platforms.<br /><br />I'm working with the free version and like it a lot.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hosseini is a very talented writer.  I enjoyed most of the book but it seemed to get bogged down in the different story lines. The whole drug lord segment didn't seem to go anywhere except that the son began to see the differences in the life his family lived and the lives of the villagers, and what happened to the town.  The Greek doctor's background was unnecessary to the story except that it put him in Kabul with Nabi's story, and  he saw the suffering of people from a young age.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|After all these years, the action and drama hold up.  This will keep you on the edge of your seat and entertained for the entire series.  Not to be missed.
1609611543|5.0|Excellent book.  Does a great job of explaining why the wheat we eat today is so harmful to our bodies.  It is very easy to understand even though it's written by a doctor.  The author explains how wheat negatively effects every system in our bodies.  It is a must-read for everyone who eats wheat!!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|What an amazing film. From the cinematography, acting, story line and last but not least, the directors decision to lean in to the source material and not shy away from it. Dredd is set in a bleak, dystopian, post nuclear world where it feels as though humanity is on its last leg. The comics depicted this clearly, and it's a treat to see the director bring this realism to the screen. There is no watering down, or shying away from that fact. Karl Urban loses himself in the title character and is at once stoic and yet shows a man 1-2 steps away from going over the edge at all times. The film is concise, driven and gripping. Karl Urban has been delivering amazing roles to the screen for some time now, and after this work, the man should finally take the lead in a main studio push.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Billy and Maggie along with the bits and pieces of Opera were great!!  Actually enjoyed the showing of older actors 'rol call' at the end credits!!
B008602KQI|3.0|I honestly don't get what all the hype is over this film. I'm talking about the film, not the books. Though I have not read any of them, I'm sure they are great. The general story line of the movie itself is interesting. Given the proper cast and directing vision it would be an original premise to bring to the audience, considering the recent push of horrible sequels and terrible remakes from Hollywood. Unfortunately, this movie lacks neither any depth, proper character development nor a director with a clear vision. It's a second tier film, with sub-par acting all around that is bolstered simply from its source material, the books themselves. I don't want to come across as a hater, but it's a shame considering many teenagers and young adults have clearly enjoyed the books, to have a studio serve up this Sunday afternoon snoozer as its live action adaptation of that material.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I have musculature issues so fast paced games that require precision I am poor at but this game is thrilling while being easy to play! I would recommend for any age &amp; skill level!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Marvel did a great job setting up the Avengers film, and the cast delivered a wonderful performance. Of course with Ironman being their marquee franchise, Tony Stark was center stage throughout the movie. This does not take away from everyone else, but you do put your money man center stage to bring in the audiences.  At times it did feel more like \\"Ironman And Friends\\", but the film overall delivers good character development and helps in setting up each characters possible solo film going forward. The only main gripe I have is that story and grit wise, Marvel stayed middle of the road. They have found a winning formula with a general audience appeal, and for their first all-star film they were not going to move away from that. Considering the story line, I would have enjoyed a bit more of real world feel to the film; a bit of Nolan with a touch of The Hurt Locker. After all it is super powered humans fighting aliens.<br />Overall it's a great fun film, with a story that keeps the pace moving. The only major failure is the rushed wrap up at the end with the alien defeat. It's clearly a cop out and would have been better served in showing a 10 minutes clean up fight sequence.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I have not finished the book (53% read).  Interesting historical background of the era.  Mr. Aslan appears to pick and choose which scripture to use to support his position that Jesus is not the Son of God, only an interesting historical figure.
B004R0YHI0|5.0|And I loved it! My professor knows how to pick good movies.  I didn't think I would enjoy this movie, until I realized it was about Valerie Plame, former CIA officer whose cover was blown by a reporter.  It's extremely interesting and makes you question the ethical actions on behalf of the acting administration.  Definitely worth watching!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|He had a little bit of a hard time getting into the story at first, but by chapter 5 he was devouring the story. He recommends it to all of his friends.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|The plot kept me on edge with lots of intrigue throughout. The actors did a wonderful job in making their characters believable!
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|The synopsis of this book that I read on Amazon made me believe this book was going to be different. I was lead to believe I would be reading a love story between two mismatched people. To me it was more of a story of two people's journey to make sense of their lives, to break free from the constrictions place on them in childhood, and their journey to heal their child hood pains, while they look for belonging. No love story here.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great so fun I love it so much I just want to play it over and over great game. :-)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This novel captured my interest from the first page. I couldn't put it down! Each page left me with more curiosity as to how this new world was organized, how society worked and more questions of how they came to be in their situation. I'm not a huge sci fi fan, but this didn't really read like sci-fi to me.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Said by my 7  year old son, it was awesome and I like adventures.<br />Now to keep the reading going.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I absolutely loved this. I  would recommended it to anyone. Can't wait to finish the second book in the series.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Christianity has been awaiting the scholarship of Reza Aslan.  He powerfully pulls back the curtain of thousands of years of mythology to reveal the truth of what Muslims are telling us: the prophetic word of God continues, always cloaked in the culture I which it is revealed!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Witty, clever, funny! I love this show. And since I need 13 more words to post a review, I'll use these.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I love Jack Reacher , great writing , love the story line, Lee Child has brought the character alive , I love it
B0052RCX0G|4.0|Well, I would just like to give a quick review for this book(A History of the World in 100 Objects).  I was required to read this for a world history class I am taking in college.  While this is required reading I must say this would be an extremely enjoyable read outside of college.  In fact I intend on reading the whole book when I finish this semester.  I seriously recommend this book to anyone interested in ancient history.
080414947X|2.0|I never really finished it  It just wasn't up to his normal standard.  And I have always considered the author my most favorite.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Sound quality stutters<br />Simply turning it on and off is a pain in the ass (It's a rubbery litle buttn that you literally have to sink your finger into and hold down for as long as it take to get the thing to flash red.<br />Battery life is NOT ten ours. MUCH LESS.<br />NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GAMING CONSOLES!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Loved Girl Gone. Loved this. The who makes it a flowing easy read.  The character's are real a d make you care.
B003V1WXKU|1.0|Reading this book was an absolute chore. His attempt to humanize himself (and perhaps scientists generally) come across as pathetic and desperate. There is hardly any physics to be found, and when he does include some it isn't explained in a comprehensible way.<br /><br />What is most disturbing is the sexual politics. If you are put off by overt and outdated sexism, skip Section 4. The bulk of it describes tricking women into having sex with him, getting laid without having to buy any drinks, picking up prostitutes in Las Vegas, his wandering eye, and describes women as \\"whores\\" and \\"bitches\\" to psyche himself up for flirting. It is offensive and disturbing. He also describes going to college parties as a professor and tricking co-eds into thinking he's a student so he can have sex with them. I don't see how any reader could get through that chapter with a smile on their face.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have mentioned, his pranks are so off-putting that they ruin the tone of the book. Some are merely childish, such as stealing a door and then \\"admitting\\" to it with a sarcastic tone (see how clever he is? He never lied! Those other idiots couldn't figure it out! HAHAHAHA). Some are a disturbing insight into his mind, such as hiding waitress' tips under full glasses of water (see how clever he is compared to waitresses? They didn't figure out the trick and got drenched at their minimum wage job! Silly bitches! HAHAHAHA).<br /><br />Beyond his bizarre attitude, the book suffers from being poorly written and seems to lack any editing. His stories jump through time and space, with a wife in the hospital appearing the page after bringing two deaf girls home with him. The book lacks a coherent vision or organizational structure. Being loosely chronological makes it even more jarring when he (frequently) hops from one location to another. I appreciate that writing is not his specialty, but that makes it all the more necessary to have an editor. So many sentences end with exclamation points! It never stops! It's really off-putting!<br /><br />I don't know who to recommend this book for. There isn't enough physics to entertain a scientific mind, the jokes are too flat for someone looking to laugh, the ideas are too sexist for feminists, and the attitude is too self-serving for anyone but himself.d with exclamation points!

B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I know the Bible quite well. When I saw this author talking about his book on several TV programs, I was excited that someone has researched what I have wondered about Jesus during the years that are not mentioned in the Bible. I was disappointed with the way this material was presented. It was boring and did not answer much of what I was seeking.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've fallen in love with this series. After hearing my coworkers rave about the series, I finally got the opportunity to watch and I can't wait til the next season starts.......
0744014956|5.0|Has pictures of all vehicles including heli's and planets. Every mission single mission and every single achievement is in the book. If you want to beat and get everything in the game the book is a must !
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I liked the movie. It had an interesting story and was well made. It wasn't reinventing the wheel, we have seen these movies about the ex military drifter, whose background is somewhat unknown who comes into a town and next thing you know, he has found himself in the middle of alot of stuff. It was entertaining and had enough new little twists to make it fun to watch.
B003JH8LPW|2.0|This Dan Brown novel did not match his earlier ones. the edge of the seat action went on and on with the countdown and unbelievable hurdle to master.
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain has hit a home run with this book. It is thoroughly researched and balanced with respect to the contributions and value of both introverts and extroverts. Her major point is that our society celebrates and rewards extroversion and in many cases ostracizes and marginalizes introverts. And yet she shows with abundant well-researched evidence that it is introverts who make the major discoveries and developments that advance our standard of living and safety.<br /><br />As an introvert myself, this book is helping me understand why I struggle in so many social situations, and that there is nothing wrong with me for not enjoying the same kinds of events and activities as so many of my acquaintances. It is especially helping me to see clearly my lifelong frustration with not feeling like I belong in the evangelical Christian world.<br /><br />Whether you are introverted or extroverted, I strongly recommend this book to better understand why each group views the world differently, and rather than expecting the others to conform to our way, we should understand and be grateful for the alternative viewpoint they offer.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I marvel at the resilience of children.  This book was a window to the Orphan Train kids.  Well written and just plain a good read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Definitely a book for older kids due to some content. It is really well written and touching, but not in a sappy way. I hate sappy.  I would recommend it to both older teens and adults.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|This film is a good filler as the second part of Casino Royale, but don't expect nearly the same type of action as you see in either Casino Royale or Skyfall.  Many of the scenes are choppy (especially the first car chase which almost gave me whiplash) and the dialogue between characters can often seem to last forever.  This film was long enough in some sections that I just turned it off until I felt like watching it again a few days later.  Search the internet for the interview Daniel Craig gave with &#34;The Playlist&#34; and you'll understand how detrimental a writer's strike can be on a film's script.  It really shows with this film.<br /><br />I could watch Casino Royale or Skyfall almost any day of the week.  I don't think I'll watch Quantum of Solace more than once a year.
B00BF2RTO2|3.0|It is a great concert, but I can't see or hear any improvement, looks old and sounds old too, but as a Maiden fan I still loved it
B005LAIIN0|1.0|This is a poorly constructed bore of a movie.At the end I was like what did they run out of money and decided to just end it here. I even watched it in 3d which did not even have good effects. ZZZZZZZZZZ
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Had already seen the movie in theaters and loved it.  Blue ray seems even better than theaters, that could be because of focus and projector vibration.  I love ultraviolet that allows me to get a digital copy that Plays on multiple devices that I have.  One thing to keep in mind is that the digital copy policy has changed, other movies I have, allow a digital copy on ultra violet as well as iTunes.  This movie forces you to choose...
B005544TRQ|4.0|ME AND MY FAMILY JUST LOVE THIS SHOW.............WE LIKE THE BOYS AND THERE BOSS LADY!!<br /><br />BOYS ARE BAD AND BOSS LADY SMART AND SEXY
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great story line, not predictable, superb acting, casting that is spot on.  All in all this was very entertaining and lends itself to marathon viewing through all of the episodes.  Loved it.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Wow!  I had no idea about this recording studio saga.  Every musician or musician wanna be should watch this.  Brought tears to my eyes.  I could not stop watching.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Great show I wish I watched it when it was airing.  Ill work through to SGU.  Superb acting with great chemistry and it shows with ten seasons as a testament.  One of the greats in science fiction universe.
B0094K20FK|4.0|This episode is obviously an  &#34;oldie&#34; but it is still an exciting &#34;goodie&#34;.  You can watch this one in order or out of order regarding other episodes.  Still good.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game. All around fun. Recommended highly. Download this game at your own amusement. This is a really fun and addicting game.
0061950726|4.0|No complaints from her about it. I bought it as a gift I bought it because of the good rating on it and it seemed to be a true to life story. So I bought it for her .  She also said her friends loved it and she asked me how did I know about buying that book.
B000FC11A6|5.0|The story takes place during present times and during WWII.  People from Allied and Axis countries interact during WWII, and in present times their descendants and they interact again while trying to solve a secret.  In the story there is much conflict and gruesome things occur during WWII and during present times, but somehow the book is hilarious.  The main character is a computer guy that is somewhat awkward.  Every now and then there is a full page on mathematics, cryptology, or electronics.  These are very interesting and informative, but if you decide to skip them it will not affect you following the story. This book is amazing, absolutely brilliant.
B000WN60NG|5.0|I liked the story very much, I like the stories when that blend a little of all the characters back histories together. It makes these kinds of movies more believable.
B00EV4EUT8|5.0|This was a great movie.  It would be nice if more young people especially teenagers can view it to get a glimpse of history and the struggles of Black Americans.  This movie invoked several emotions from happiness, anger to sadness.  Although it was long, I remained fully engaged and enjoyed the movie in its' entirety.  A 'must see' and great addition to any movie collection.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! 1 star was its humour..it has such cheeky bold fun....1 star was for its truth...1 star was for its simplicity..easy to follow instruction and sharing. the 4th star was for the calibre of its content with heaps of research and facts to learn and know..and the 5 th star was for the magic it creates in your life after you come in to contact with it..grab this book with all your heart..together you will fly.....well done Pammie !!

Since I don't have the weather channel with my basic cable subscription I use to have to get my weather report from the radio or broadcast tv. Not anymore . I simply tap my weather app and I have an instant weather report. I'm in meteorological bliss. If your going to purchase a weather app this is the one!
B003H4I4JU|2.0|Ender was a much better book than this sequel. Found it a bit confusing at times and just about lost interest in the story. Feel I wasted money buying this one...
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I don't like the app. because you can't go to your account settings.<br />The app. Sucks I hate it classic site was better. Thank you.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I like 80s movies, I enjoyed this one. 5 teens on detention on a saturday. All them different, but they discover many similarities while the day goes by....
B0028AQLYE|5.0|I swim with this product most of the time. I do not see any advantage in twisting my neck trying to breathe! For those with neck and shoulder problems, this is the best method. Add to it the Finish M3P player with your favorite tunes and it is a joy to swim endlessly! Many thanks to the Finis people and their great products. I had to put in a &#34;plug&#34; for the music I get to hear underwater with no garbling sound at all. The finest products. I will continue to buy from them and appreciate the great service. This was sent in a timely manner. Barbara
B005FDW7AI|5.0|I loved this movie.  Many heart warming happenings. All about the magic in every lady to be a princess ...if she so believes.  And how this magic can affect others.<br /><br />Shows that what is in your heart comes to be. Through all odds.
1623650003|4.0|Although thirty-year-old Alex Pr&eacute;vost is beautiful, she was once \\"a scrawny, rather ugly little girl.\\"  Alex is a loner who derives pleasure from little things, like eating a nice meal and shopping for pretty clothes. One evening, after having dinner at a restaurant, she decides to walk home instead of taking the bus.  Before she realizes what is happening, an unidentified assailant grabs, punches, and kicks her, and then throws her into his van.<br /><br />Parisian Commandant Camille Verhaeven is chief of detectives, a middle-aged widower who, like Alex, has plenty of emotional baggage.  After a personal tragedy left him shattered, he slowly recovered and is trying to rebuild his career in the \\"brigade criminelle,\\" a division of the French police that handles major crimes.  His superior, Divisionnaire Jean Le Guen, assigns Verhaeven to look into Alex's kidnapping.  Besides being clever, intuitive, strong-willed, and impertinent, Camille, the son of a famous painter, Maude Verhaeven, is a talented artist.  He often draws to help focus his thoughts.<br /><br />\\"Alex,\\" by Peter Lemaitre, translated from the French by Frank Wynne, is a disturbing and bizarre psychological thriller that is gruesome, violent, and frequently terrifying.  The title character is tortured and starved by her vicious captor.  Readers will cringe at the author's detailed account of the hellish treatment to which she is subjected.  However, this is not merely a grisly account of an abduction and its aftermath.  As the story progresses, Lemaitre fills us in on Alex's history; his revelations about her background put an entirely new spin on what has gone before.<br /><br />In what would otherwise have been an unbearable litany of despair, Lemaitre inserts bits of much-needed comic relief:  Camille's unusually short stature (his feet dangle above the ground when he sits) and his two colleagues, Louis Mariani (a rich man who dresses in designer clothes and has a breadth of knowledge that is truly astonishing) and a penny-pinching detective named Armand, are sources of gentle humor.  Overall, however, this is a wrenching work of fiction that offers an unrelenting portrayal of degradation, physical and emotional anguish, and agonizing pain. As we become aware of the novel's subtext, our horror deepens.  Pierre Lemaitre portrays a dysfunctional and deeply unpleasant world in which a human being's infinite capacity for evil is equaled only by his outraged victim's unquenchable thirst for revenge.pinching detective named Armand, are sources of gentle humor.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Kept my attention throughout... all the time I was wondering: what's coming?  Yes, some time there was unbelievable action. But what the heck, you expect that. That is part of what makes dreams into reality.  And I like the science tech in this movie. Enjoy!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I loved this book. For one, a &#34;Rock Star&#34; tells it like it is. There was not a Ghost Writer on this one, you can tell by reading it. Situations were written about as the truth. I praise Nikki Sixx for telling his story.
B006E2VTG2|5.0|Great escapism for a hard working guy like me. I hope she does a sequel. I'm not one to attempt an objective critique of the film. I like the girl. I like her looks. I like the action. I like the cleverness throughout. I like the outcome. And I will watch it again.
B007Z58RLC|3.0|While a little hard to follow the wandering prose at times, the book did have some interesting views on life.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|I use it as background music when reading to help me stay in the book vs listening to things around me.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game is so detailed with everything.  I love playing it  And they have made the structures really sensitive.  Wonderful animations.....
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I have three different fire cases and this is the best by far / i love the auto wake/close, I love the strap to keep it closed when in my hand bag, and the secure way it fits in the case and that you do NOT have to remove the bottom to make it stand up on side to watch stuff hands free. it's a great case I just wish they made them with designs on them to be more unique.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie because of the music and songs, and it has a cute storyline.  A  real chick flick!
B004LWZW24|4.0|Saw this in the theater enjoyed it there, got it for my friend for her birthday, watch it with ten girls that had not seen it, loved everytime they jumped!<br /><br />I enjoy a good horror movie esp one with a story line, this was one of the best in a long time! (number 2 was good also)
B008673ZAQ|3.0|It was just ok...felt like it dragged and a little irritating that every time Eva and Gideon fought, it seemed like she willingly submitted.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|Incredible and Breathtaking! This Cirque Du Soleil film weaves together a story that incorporates actually some of the best excerpts from current shows in Las Vegas. Filmed in stunning high definition this movie had me transfixed, mesmerized and unable to look away. I bought this Bluray for my brother and family who have just stepped up to a 55&#34; Sony Bravia LED TV from a 36&#34; tube. I told him its the first movie he has to watch on new set. I want to buy the 3-D for myself when that is released! To sum up it is spectacular and a must see for all members of family!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|solid game.<br />good mechanics and an engaging story line. take care in. character creation as this is the single most important aspect of gamplay.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I just wish I had captions as UK English is hard to understand. Very good writing, acting and scene. Keeps us wondering who did it without jerking us around about it.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I have been playing this game almost daily for several months.  I can not seem to stop! Some levels are easy and some are difficult.
B000SC245E|5.0|I needed to seriously renovate my printer, it was on it's last legs (or so I thought), it just needed some new parts.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this game is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone older than 5. It's worth every penny! I wish they would add some more items though, like the different kinds of wooden planks and the ability to mine redstone.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This was very different than Ender's Game, but was almost just as good. It was interesting to read about the man Ender became. I also enjoyed getting to know the new characters in his life.
B005IZNM0W|1.0|I bought this car from ABCTOY4me, though the delivery was done by Amazon through PRIME.  My son has several of these cars and he loves them.  In fact, this was a replacement Max for one that went missing out of our stroller on a trip to the zoo.  Immediately out of the box, we sense something was fishy.  This Max was much lighter than all of the other Disney/Pixar cars that we own.  The bumper was weirdly attached and my son can move it around by pushing on it.  I expect it won't last long.  Likewise, there was absolutely none of the under-car detailing that all the other cars have.  It's just a flat piece of plastic on the bottom with a screw.  For some reason Amazon won't allow me to leave feedback for the seller, so I wanted to warn everyone away on here.  We didn't get the same quality of car that we have from other vendors.  Stay away unless you have a more reputable source, I'm pretty sure the Max we got was a knockoff - and not even a very good one at that.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Normally I don't read books like this but I thought I would read something different.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and can't wait to start the next one.

B00CTT9646|5.0|All that needs to be said is, &#34;It's Star Trek&#34;.  This is an incredible gift set. The disc package comes with the 3D disc, the Blu Ray disc, the DVD disc and the code for a digital version.  The package is a beautiful lenticulated version.  The phaser is unbelievably detailed, finely crafted and made of solid metal.  A well designed plastic display stand is included as well.  This has become the centerpiece of my ever growing memorabilia collection. This is a must have for anybody.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|It was not user friendly.  I went back to my original book of the bible I had downloaded on my Kindle.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love these coin push games. They are great fun and the prizes are fun to try to get! I just wish the coins wouldn't go so fast and it wouldn't cost money every time you need to get more! There should be a giveaway of coins,
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The piggy's are back! Only this time on the pork side. In this sequel to the original game you can play on the bird side or the pork side. Either way is fun. If you are a fan of the Angry Birds saga you will love this game.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|So depressing.  Everyone is miserable and suffers from the sensibilities of one person.  While Emily Bronte was talented, this book is not a favorite.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie was a surprise delight. After watching this I thought I had experienced the magical mystery tour the Beatles sing about. The cast is amazing, the plot is amazing and it pulls out a lot of tricks. So see it!! See it!! See it!! 5 stars and i rarely rate them 5
0316056871|2.0|While Tina Fey is the first lady of Comedy - I think she should stick to writing SNL and not books.
8866135909|4.0|I don't think this planner is worth the price, but I'm still pretty happy about my purchase.<br /><br />- The paper bleeds if you use fountain pen ink (Or at least with Noodler's and Waterman inks)<br />- There's a lot of &#34;fluff&#34; pages in the beginning with conversion tables, time zone information, maps, etc. Not useful for me, but it may be for others<br />- It has a cool expanding pocket in the back and comes with stickers you can use in your planner (things like birthday, event, etc).<br />- Has a ribbon you can use as a bookmark<br /><br />On the left side it's split into 7 sections with 4 or 5 lines to write stuff down whereas the right side is a blank lined page that I use to make todo lists or take short notes. Overall, a great student planner and probably the planner I'll use next year.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|WE RENTED THIS BECAUSE WE COULDN'T WATCH TINKERBELL ONE MORE TIME WITH OUR 2 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER.  SHE WAS VERY ATTENTIVE THROUGHOUT, THE MUSIC AND DANCING ARE WONDERFUL.  THEY DON'T MAKE EM LIKE THEY USED TO.  NICE FAMILY MOVIE, FUN, FUNNY AND WITHOUT THE STUFF YOU DON'T WANT CHILDREN TO SEE.
B00810VJPG|5.0|this is so well written, it's enjoyable to read. I would consider this an educational book rather than easy reading . Having said that, I am finding it is easy to read and retain the information presented.
B001A4LYN2|1.0|For what I paid, this video stream was piss poor quality. I expected better from Amazon.    I want my money back.
B005OP7162|5.0|great show cant wait to watch season 2,<br />loved it, the excitment and just waiting to see what is going to happened next
1401207529|5.0|As a Batman fan from the animated series, to the movies and the games (Arkham series), this would be the first comic book I ever read and I've gotta say, I absolutely LOVE it.<br />Yes, I'm new to the comic books, but this is really, as people say the greatest story of how Bruce Wayne started his career as The Caped Crusader.<br /><br />This graphic novel is a masterpiece. Frank Miller's excellent writing combined with David Mazzucchelli's great art, make this hard to beat.<br />It shows us two sides: One is Bruce Wayne becoming the Batman and because of that, he's being chased by the police.<br />The other one is Lt. Jim Gordon, a devoted police officer, coming to Gotham with his pregnant wife Barbara, only to find out that almost every cop in the city is corrupted, including the commissioner himself.<br /><br />This is really all you need to know. I'm not gonna spoil anything else.<br />I'm just gonna say that it is an amazing, fantastic, excellent graphic novel and it leaves you thirsty for more.<br />I can see the inspiration for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight films here.<br /><br />So, like I said before, this is the best story for every Batman fan to read, so read it, you won't regret it!
B00C5R8364|5.0|Excellent book----You almost thought it was true.  One of his best books.  I highly recommend it.  Looking forward to the next book.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|if cheesy and romantic is what you want, then it is a great movie, I really enjoyed it, strongly recommend it
B00464AVXW|5.0|Great premise, great dialogue, great pacing, great acting and great actors = Great movie!<br />This is a &#34;watch it again&#34; movie over the years.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is so great to have this in my kindle when I am on a trip.  I even enjoy it sitting on my patio and relaxing.  I am 79 years old and feel this is good for my memory.  Thanks for the game and especially that it is a free item.<br />Gloria Bernhard
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it! I can't wait for more levels! it is challenging and fun.<br />works great on my kindle fire.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Star Trek into Darkness was just the movie I was looking for. I was looking for a Scifi movie with action an into darkness delivered.
0738727326|5.0|I have been eyeing this deck ever since I saw it a few years ago, but I only decided to buy it very recently. Overall, I was very pleased with my purchase. Regarding the deck itself, all the art is absolutely gorgeous. Some people have mentioned how thin the cards are, but they are only slightly thinner than traditional cards (for a trading card game like Pokemon or Yugioh), and I have found that it is easier for me to shuffle my deck because of this. The cards are a little small (especially given how much detail has been given to each card), but it's great for people who have small hands (like me) and, again, lends itself to better shuffling. The symbolism for the Shadowscapes Tarot Deck are very non-traditional, and so I found myself having to interpret the cards in new and unique ways. For an experienced reader, this can serve as an exciting way to re-discover your love for tarot reading, but beginners might want to look elsewhere for a more traditional deck.<br /><br />The deck does come in a box and a little white book. When I received my deck, my box came a little dinged up, and I would advise finding alternatives to the box to carry your deck.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Overall it was a good action movie. It did not make you think too much. Lots of action, things blowing up and a great car chase. I think this was a testing ground for new generation of &#34;John McLean's&#34; to see if it should end here or continue to the next generation. Overall it was fun to watch.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|I buy these games as soon as they come out. My 3 year old has been playing with these games for over a year. She loves figuring out what she had to do to get the &#34;sparkles and stickers&#34;. She will play each game over and over because the game varies for each situation and each character.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Really impossible to believe feats of magic done on such a grand scale that it is ridiculous to assume that only 4 people are responsible for it all...still it has some spectacular special effects...if you live in a dream world where every Millennial is only an abracadbra away from wishing things into being, then this is the movie for you...
B005MMY9A8|3.0|A little slow at times. Seemed to lack what the other Marvel movies had. It could have benefited from less computer generated scenes, and more quality in the writing and directing.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Don't bother with anything else. This app is accurate, has a great lay out and worth the money. I highly recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I kept seeing this show in the menu and finally decided to watch it. It is a really good series.
B000T433CO|5.0|Truly quirky love story.  Each couple in different and beautiful settings as usual with Nancy Meyers.  This movie is better than comfort food.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book reminds me to pray for those warriors who risk their lives for us and for those who have fallen before.  I pray and hope that Chris Kyle and his family strengthens and prospers.  The way the book is written seems to give us a bit of insight not only into being a warrior but also a sense of the struggles and worries that the families of the warriors go through as well.  God Bless you, your family, and your comrades
B007THA4FI|1.0|I received this book as a gift, and I should have quit reading it after the first chapter.  It was twisted, hard to read, depressing and disturbing.  The end of the book was completely anti-climatic and there was no plot or conclusion that tied the whole thing together.  The entire book consisted of the meanderings and selfish actions of various people in a community. I kept thinking that the book had to get better once I got through the agonizing torture of trying to keep track of all the different characters and their relationships. No such luck!<br /><br />This book left me feeling depressed, sad and discouraged to be a member of the human race. I usually donate my books to the local thrift store.  In good conscience I couldn't recycle Casual Vacancy for another person to read - I tossed Casual Vacancy into the garbage where it belongs.<br /><br />Do not waste your time on this book!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Frankly I don't see why everyone is complaining about it... It is a fun game and given time your energy recharges. Its like that on MANY games... so why get mad at this one
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I really like this app but I really wonder why more weapons. This is a really good app so check it out.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great plots often drawn from the headlines with all-over-the-map relationships among the ensemble cast. While &#34;Calinda&#34; may have won an Emmy, other characters give equally superb performances in the series that is about a law firm  always on the brink of bankruptcy ,or a lawsuit (theirs not their clients), or their own internal wars and romances.
140525355X|5.0|We bought the Complete Collection of Mr. Men books for our grandson when he turned 4.  He loves us reading to him about the different personalities of the &#34;men&#34; and he likes explaining their personalities to us.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Entertaining enough. Would have expected a  better show, given the cast.  Expectations low tho,  thanks rotten tomatoes,  so not a bad movie when you're out of ideas what to watch.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick has captured the essence of genius and shares it with his readers in a most readable and enjoyable way. I found myself unable to put it down, even getting up at 3am because some of the ideas needed re-reading. Nikola Tesla was a fascinating man, and an excellent subject choice by the author to demonstrate the makings of \\"genius.\\" This book caused me to discover much about myself; where I've applied the priciples of genius, and where I haven't but have allowed convention to dictate my actions...and the results have been clear. Unleash your creative side...read this book!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Extremely suspenseful from the opening scene to the ending credits. We were on the edge of our seats the whole time and didn't want it to end!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids were begging for this game. I originally tried downloading on my daughter's Kurio and it would say it was on the tablet but it would not open. So I downloaded on my Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is the best game in the world you can own a horse and name it any thing your heart wants
B00E56WUZS|4.0|I first heard 'Summertime Sadness' in a remix for Uplifting Trance. I like the original version better and discovered the album, which is good all the way through.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I give this book four stars because it is exceptionally written. It intertwines some of the most beautiful prose I have ever written. If you are not hooked upon reading the first chapter, then maybe this book is not for you. It takes you away, (yes, cliche) but it really, truly does. I did not want to read a sad book, but I could not give up on these characters. I needed to have some resolution. I think that is the magic of Hosseini as a writer. We care about his characters. Even when his characters are flawed, or lack moral conviction, we care about them. This book is no different. My only complaint is the storylines were hard to follow at times. I found myself working hard in each chapter, trying to figure out which character he was referring to. He moves around a lot, time, place, etc. And, some storylines I did not always feel were necessary. But, alas, when the last two pages were read, I had streams of tears running down my face. My pillow was soaked when I went to be because I could not stop thinking about this brother and sister duo, lost for 60 years to each other. I never cry in books, very rare. I guess that says something.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A wonderful read, stimulating and empathetic for those who struggle in handling the world around them.  The movie couldn't possibly depict in two hours the relationship the reader gains in spending hours and days with these wonderful flawed characters. I'm so glad that I read it.
B000FCJZ3G|4.0|Had some great points and worth the read, but not in the top 10 of business books I have read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well written, but worth the time? The twists and turns are neat, but the book didn't really appeal to my values regarding good fiction writing.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|A great easy read. Megan is a great character, and the portrayal of an abused woman is exactly right. Rarely do we get to read a book that deals with a horrible subject but treats it with grace and reality. This book talks about abuse while giving hope that life can and will be better. Thank you Jill for doing such a wonderful job on this topic. The characters are great, and the scenes are incredible. I want to go sit on the rock next to the pond. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Hooked! The characters are flawed but not to the point you don't see a glimmer of hope. Action is non-stop!
B00B52F278|4.0|Spartacus: War of the Damned, well, I think by now everyone know's or realizes that the Starz Spartacus series is \\"over the top\\" on all levels, but still, it is my guilty pleasure.  In the special features section one of the creators admits to adding too much sex to the series, which is funny because in the HBO series \\"ROME\\" (which is an amazing and extraordinary and superbly acted series) the historical consultant mentions that he doesn't think there is enough sex in that series. It is true, there is a lot of sex, violence and gore in the series, but what I like about the series is that they do a great job of portraying the ancient Roman social attitudes at the end of the Republic and into the first century the way that it was.  I felt that what they portrayed and how they portrayed the ancient Romans was pretty much the way they were, and right in line with what I've studied.<br /><br />I have a particular taste for great drama, period drama etc., however, SWOD isn't so much about the \\"upstairs, downstairs\\" dramatics as it is about the sword fighting and the war and conflict.  SWOD at this point now, is outside and takes place largely in fields of battle and so fourth. Therefore I am inclined to say that in SWOD there is not a whole lot of dramatic context, but loads of action, blood and gore. Therefore, for me, the last two episodes in SWOD, episodes 9 and 10 were the best of this installment because of it's dramatic elements.  I have read online or seen interviews online where the actors mentioned that SWOD demanded more acting skills from them because it was a little more dramatic and emotional, that it required them to really put their acting chops to the test.  Those last two episodes are quite sad, and for a number of reasons not the least of which I think everyone kind of knows how it all ends, but also probably because they have to say goodbye to their cast mates, some of whom have been with each other from the start, knew Mr. Whitfield, etc, etc.  However, for me, dramatically, it didn't really live up to it's hype, but it certainly did with the action scenes.  In regards to the actors, Simon Merrells (who portrayed Crassus) was by far the best actor in SWOD.  There is a scene in particular where he's sparring verbally with Caesar and the camera catches and flashes his emotions and looks from different angles, one after the other,  and it is very compelling.  Todd LaSance, the young actor who portrays Caesar, is also very, very good.  Todd LaSance seems to be able to display some range in his acting abilities.  It seems that a lot of people have been critical about Liam McIntyre's interpretation of \\"Spartacus\\" - I believe largely because they have been, were, loyal to the late Mr. Whitfield.  However, I don't think Mr. McIntyre did a bad job.  Yes, he has similar looks as Mr. Whitfield, they both are (were-in Mr. Whitfields case) good looking men, nice bodies, etc, etc., but in regards to their acting abilities, I personally don't see much difference.  In my opinion, the part of \\"Spartacus\\" isn't exactly \\"Hamlet\\" ... he really doesn't have to display a whole lot of range ... and In \\"Blood and Sand\\" (in my opinion) although he did a great job, I didn't see a lot of rang in the part of Spartacus.  The actress who portrayed Naevia, Ms. Robinson, did a great job there near the end.  In my opinion, her character and Mr. Bennett's character \\"Crixus\\" had lost their minds a long time ago, and they both were definitely meant for each other because they were both off their rockers.  Again, Ms. Robinson is another actress who replaced an actress before her who performed the role of Naevia.  It seems that Ms. Robinson's look is compared to that of Ms. Brandt (the actress who portrayed Naevia in the previous installments) and it seems that the fans who were loyal to Ms. Brandt would have liked for her to have continued in that role, but Ms. Brandt left for other projects ... and I read that she didn't think the role \\"spicy\\" enough.  Well, it wasn't til it was ... especially towards the end of the series, and I think Ms. Robinson did a good job at portraying her loss and suffering, plus making me believe that she just basically was nuts all around.<br /><br />Although well done, SWOD is not my favorite installment. \\"Blood and Sand\\" is my favorite installment, being the most dramatic and having the most \\"upstairs/downstairs\\" intrigue.  My favorite being the conflict between Ilythia, Licinia and Lucretia.  Those girls were just b***hes. Plain and simple. \\"Gods of the Arena\\" would be my next favorite, and \\"Vengeance\\" coming in third. Ilythia, Lucretia and Glaber getting what they deserve at the end of \\"Vengeance\\" was wonderful.  All in all I believe it is worth watching.  Some of the critics of the series say that it is soft porn or very close to it.  Well, in my opinion, I'd agree with that, which is why it is my guilty pleasure.<br /><br />GWH
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book with my book club and we all enjoyed it very much. It was on a very current and disturbing theme of a murder of a young, school aged boy. Some of the group found it very upsetting to read. I found it very compelling. I couldn't put it down and thought it had a lot of great twists and turns. I would highly recommend this book to anyone age 14 and up. There is a lot to discuss and think about. It is very shocking as well. Read it.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I just finished watching World War Z and was very pleased.  I'm not a zombie movie fan at all, due to extreme gore with very little plot.  I saw \\"Zombie\\" in 1979 and when I was telling someone about it the next day, I got sick to my stomach.  That did it for me for zombie movies.<br /><br />World War Z was enjoyable and had a good plot.  I bought it because of reading customer reviews on Amazon, that said it didn't have the normal zombie gore. I watched it yesterday while I was riding my recumbent bike and I was riding at level 4 resistance and it felt like I was riding at level 1, because I was so involved in the movie and peddling faster.  I had only seen it partially and told my husband about it, so we watched the whole movie today.  Even my husband enjoyed it and he doesn't watch those types of movies.  He compared it to the movie \\"Omega Man\\" with Charleton Heston.<br /><br />I watch action packed movies while I ride my bike everyday and World War Z is a new favorite.  I think I'll watch it again this evening while I ride my bike, just to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br /><br />If you want to see an entertaining movie, that has zombies and won't gross you out, World War Z is the one.

1439153663|2.0|Everyone I've talked to about it loves this book. I expected to enjoy it. I love historical fiction and was excited to find this on my book club reading list.<br /><br />'The Kitchen House' is the story of Lavinia, a young Irish girl who becomes an indentured servant when her parents die on the way to America. She is placed with the Captain's black slaves before he departs for the high seas again. Promising start, right? It all goes down hill from there.<br /><br />The author uses dual first person perspectives for each chapter, alternating between Lavinia and Belle, the black woman who raises her. This is not a writing style that I am very fond of, and in this novel it seems to serve no purpose. The Belle chapters may as well be titled \\"spoiler\\" because they give away information that makes the rest of the story far too predictable. A little more mystery would have made this book more interesting.<br /><br />Then there is the historical content. If I could have ignored the references to restaurants, slaves having the weekend off, and people literally getting away with murder, maybe I would have enjoyed this more. I just didn't feel like I was transported onto a post-Revolution tobacco plantation. The interactions between the white people and slaves were all extreme. Either they were \\"family\\" and color made absolutely no difference or black people were property and to be used as such. No moderate view seemed to exist with the possible exception of Will Stephens' but I think we're only supposed to notice that he is hot. Despite the clear race lines, it takes Lavinia until page 149 to realize that they exist. How is a girl living with slaves surprised by the division between blacks and whites? The whole story feels like a turn of the century soap opera, from the man who impregnates his sister to the two women who agree to share a husband.<br /><br />Lavinia didn't do much to inspire any sympathy from me. She is meek, timid, and makes huge decisions based on assumptions and fear. I also had to roll my eyes at the fact that about the time she reached puberty three men started fighting for the right to marry her. It's every successful 1800s man's dream to marry the indentured servant. Of course, in her naivety, Lavinia chooses the wrong one. She is blind to the most obvious things going on around her - for years . . . . years. Maybe she gets it from Belle who is also amazingly capable of making bad decisions and keeping things secret for long enough to have severe consequences.<br /><br />Maybe I've become too much of a historical fiction snob, but I like a little history with my fiction, not farfetched romance and exaggerated drama. Go read 'Roots' instead.s and fear. I also had to roll my eyes at the fact that about the time she reached puberty three men started fighting for the right to marry her.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love how the actors bring this era to life!  Van't wait to learn more about our family and their lives.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I'm not really sure what the excitement was over these books. The plot was very weak and only had a few exciting chapters. And I think exciting is pushing it. It was very repetitive and pointless at times. I mean how many times did I have to read about him running his fingers through his hair and her biting her lip. I thought it was  hilarious how the author would throw in some \\"educated\\" words like \\"wonton\\" after they had sex. As Ana would say, \\"he made me feel so \\"wonton\\". Hmmmm, ok.
B0055D3EFU|3.0|Really a scary show......  Could have been more so though , 3 of 5 because it could have been better...  but as far as newer scary movies go pretty good...  I rate all scary movies on the &#34;Shinning&#34; scale, and it (imo) is 60% of that at best....
1400052181|2.0|What should have been a feel-good story about HeLa cells, talented researchers, and efforts of bio-pharmaceutical companies to treat diseases and improve lives, becomes a story of endless victimhood. It's hard to understand how the family, whose mother was a footnote in a greater picture of scientific progress surrounding HeLa cells, feels entitled to a wealth that was created in labs and companies around the world. Interestingly, they are not drawn to the knowledge that was accumulated, as they remain poor, uneducated, and some even criminal.<br /><br />Author's insertions of herself into a story of an uninteresting family and the uninteresting live of Henrietta Lacks adds nothing to nothing.<br /><br />After reading the book, I am left with basically one question. How is it possible that a book like that resonates with our society?
B00F35BV64|5.0|i really like how true to the original characters the actors try to be ..well except saldana.i think she just played as she saw it. but everyone i felt tried to stay true to the original characters especially pegg and urban.  i cant wait for the next movie! i think jj abrams has a good take on star trek and i love the twist he did in this movie..remember when spock died????...think about it :)
B008AK8FHM|3.0|While I liked the message of the book, the author wrote like a neurosurgeon at times. Some of us aren't at that level intellectually and his message was blurred because of it.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|i am not into zombies and I didn't really like the story. but if you like zombie movies this might be for you.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|When I first watched it I didn't expect much. But the way Kevin Spacey plays Francis Underwood is so brilliant. He connects with you as he looks into the camera. Whether you think he is a nice guy or not he makes you realize in politics you gotta be a bad guy to get great things done. I would recommend this to the college students and the older generation. Excellent show and I cannot wait for the second season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. My cousins said i should get it and i did and now i just about play it every day. I think everyone of all ages can play this and have fun with it.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game, shows how fun it is to create your very own &quot;Ponyville.&quot; By helping &quot;Twilight&quot; and her friends to prevent &quot; Nightmare Moon&quot; from concealing all of &quot; Equestria&quot; in the Darkness of Night. It kinda helps with understanding building things, and having to wait for it to finish. This game is so awesome!!!!!!!! I still can't believe it is free, no money needed. Don't just take my word for it, they're so many other people who like this game too. Join us, and we can all be friends in MLP.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Just not the book for me, but can be a great read for young teens. Guess I was expecting something more like the Hunger Games.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I know I'm late to this but OH MY GOD can we please just take a moment to talk about how FREAKING GOOD World War Z was??? I read the Vanity Fair article on it and I was expecting utter catastrophe and my heart was all ready to break for Brad Pitt, but I watched it TWICE in the last two days and IT IS SO BALLS AMAZING. WTH. I do not understand the haters. It was so realistic that I was so freaking paranoid and convinced that zombies were right outside my door after watching it the first time. Everything about it was absolute perfection. There wasn't a single moment in the film I wasn't clutching onto my blanket for dear life. Good job, Brad Pitt. Best.Zombie.Movie.Ever.

034580709X|3.0|My husband is the Harry Hole (pronounced \\"hula\\") fan, so he read this and pronounced it good, but not great; not as polished as the others in the series, which he is enjoying and plans to complete.<br /><br />Recommendation: Definitely recommend for fans of the Harry Holes series by Jo Nesbo.
B004H4XI5O|2.0|this book goes on and on and on about anything other than what you want to read or learn. Waist of time! I did not really learn anything truly useful.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Love this app. It syncs between my pc and android phone and keeps me from missing important scheduled appointments and meetings that I might just otherwise forget. For some reason, it also automatically syncs with the calendar that was resident on my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone as well. I've been using Google Calendar for years, so to have this app with which I am already familiar sync with my phone is great. Plenty of room to include location and any other pertinent notes for each event. Can set to automatically repeat annually for things like birthdays and anniversaries. I like that I can color code events. I particularly appreciate the reminders that come up on the home screen of my phone. Easy to use. Free. Can hardly ask for more.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|When I first began reading this book, I thought that it might just be a sappy love story; however, it turned out to be more than that. By the time I reached the end, I was happy that I had stuck with the book. Anyone who likes a good story about family and true friendship will enjoy this book. I also appreciated that it is set in Ireland.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Great game. Love the imaginative new things they came up with. To be either good or bad is a great way to vet more out of the game. Keep it coming. Will the pork federations win this time?
B001EN71DG|5.0|My son is so enjoying this DVD series , was so happy to find ! Also we received before an extended trip.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I am having to purchase the print version in addition to the Kindle version because the Kindle version doesn't include any of the figures, which are put in the book for important reasons.  Amazon does a big disservice to customers and author by not making this clear in the presentation of the book online.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Great movie and acting with Brad Pitt. This is scary and one never knows if this could happen or not.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl has given a great gift to music fans with this documentary.  Although the film is about the studio and the number of great recordings made there, it's really about two much more important things:  1) the ongoing debate over analog vs. digital and 2) the love affair of the musicians with the sound generated through the truly astounding Neve recording/mixing board.  It would be easy to see this film as nostalgic - which it is - but its genuine heart is within the soul of technology which can deliver true, truthful music.  Watching the performers generate honest music without the slightest need for autotune or any other gimmicks is truly a heartful experience.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I love everything by John Meyer. Gee what else can I say?  I am a person of few words. I like it...period.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Start from cold war-era paranoia, the preponderance of spies and bad guys all with virtually unidentifiable motives (other than &#34;we gotta get that guy or document or whatever), and mix in a plot that never lets you out for an easy breath and that's North By Northwest.  The casting is brilliant.  For those of us old enough to remember Leo G. Carroll as the fussy, put-upon home owner in the TV series TOPPER, Carroll was the perfect Hitchcock character--seemingly innocuous and yet always with a great secret of one kind or another.  Cary Grant is ideal in his role, using his comic talents to play against the slightly one-note character he's given (&#34;I'm not the man you think I am&#34; could have easily been his only line in the film as it's repeated in numerous variations--and Grant may well have found it pretty delicious, given that he always knew he was the Archie Leach of his birth and not the virtually mythical Cary Grant).  It's a great film, full of astonishing camera work and tongue-in-cheek sexuality.  Oh, and Eva Marie Saint may well have been the very best of Hitchcock's cool blondes; she certainly is in this film.

B00EFB8UHU|4.0|Thoroughly a masterpiece.  I'm an English speaking American whom has been adept at hearing lyrics as an instrument unto itself and often harbor an understanding of what is being said despite not knowing the language being sung.  To that end, this is a work of art in every facet.  Emotion in music isn't always written in the lyrics and this is evidence of that.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I thought it was a pretty decent zombie movie. I think the story is fine, the zombies are creepy but not so nasty that I didn't want to keep watching.

B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game. The trees are the best source of income, but they can take a will to grow. The plants are nice because you use energy to revive them instead of gems which cost real money which is really nice &amp; helpful. The only down side is most of the animals except 1 costs gems; ranging from 20, and up in cost. But you  can earn gems from  leveling up, completing achievements, completing goals, and some time<br />from the Genie in the lamp; which is really helpful.

B000005RS0|5.0|What started life as a vanity project for members of Heaven 17 ultimately became one of the best albums of the decade and a total rebirth for Tina Turner's career. I remember reading in Rolling Stone that, just as this album was being released, Tina was lowered to playing private shows for the likes of business conventions. \\"Private Dancer\\" changed all that, and ushered in a new style for soul singers that everyone else promptly adopted.<br /><br />First off, the production was MTV slick. You'll hear just how pristine that sound was in the hits \\"What's Love Got To Do With It\\" and \\"Better Be Good To Me.\\" Then came the superstar cameos, like Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits writing specifically for Tina and then the incendiary Jeff Beck guitar solo on the title track. A few choice covers, like the soulful renditions of The Beatles' \\"Help,\\" a powerful version of David Bowie's \\"1984,\\" the resurrection of Ann Peebles' chestnut \\"I Can't Stand The Rain,\\" and the single that kicked off the album's ascent, Al Green's \\"Let's Stay Together.\\" Despite all the sidekicks, \\"Private Dancer\\" is Tina Turner's show. All the slick production in the world couldn't mask the world-toughened power of her voice, be it the powerful kick on \\"I Might Have Been Queen\\" to the wearied wounded-ness of the title song.<br /><br />Every song on \\"Private Dancer\\" could have been a hit. As it was, five of them charted, with three top tens and \\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\" hitting number one. It remains a thoroughly enjoyable album after many years, and still a stunning example of a talent that just couldn't be kept down. \\"Private Dancer\\" is, simply stated, the absolute best of Tina Turner's solo albums.
B0083B16AG|5.0|Once heard, never to be forgotten.  More than worthwhile to have been composed and performed. Every shade of blue and other colors, too.
B00005Y0S4|3.0|Probably the most misunderstood of the Judas Priest albums featuring frontman Rob Halford, \\"Turbo\\" was 1986 Priest trying to march to the pop metal success if the likes of Def Leppard and Bon Jovi. It also started life as a double album, with half being regular Priest and the other the revised Priest. The record label nixed that idea, and this version of \\"Turbo\\" was the end result. Fans did a serious freak out when the synthesized drums and dance beat of \\"Turbo Lover\\" opened the album, and the CD soon went platinum all the same, but stalled the momentum of the band for a brief spell.<br /><br />I have a secret fondness for this CD. Despite the dance leanings, I love \\"Turbo Lover.\\" It's the mist successful of the album's attempts to meld the twin personalities on \\"Turbo.\\" For classic Priest, Halford lets loose on the heavy \\"Rock You Around The World.\\" However, you can't escape that some of the songs here seem confused and schizophonic, like \\"Wild Nights and Hot Crazy Days,\\" which sounds like just about every hair metal band of the 80's. Purist Priest never sounded generic before, and this time did, as \\"Parental Guidance\\" which was just a trendy slap at the rock hating Congressional hearings of that moment.<br /><br />Still, this is Judas Priest. Even at their most off kilter, they still could kick the poo out of about any other rock band. \\"Turbo\\" may be the most average album of their 80's recordings, but it took them till 1990's \\"Painkiller\\" to right them back on the metal line. Seriously, I found \\"Ram It Down\\" to be a lesser album than \\"Turbo,\\" so here's to playing with expectations.

B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Eccleston doesn't have the same chemistry with Piper that David Tennant has in Season 2, but the duo work well together as partners in adventure with Eccleston's Doctor acting more as mentor to the very young and wide-eyed Rose Tyler. Their voyage to the far future to watch the Earth die in a fiery finish is one of the most memorable episodes of Dr. Who to come along and nicely introduces both Rose and the audience to the Doctor's newest series rivival. Some of the monsters are cheesy, but, let's face it, they are writing for an audience combined mostly of 12 year old boys combined with all those older folks like me who grew up on the original BBC Dr. Who with tin foil costumes! A good job done and it just keeps getting better!

0812993357|3.0|The fashion-obsessed will love this behind-the-scenes commentary on famous shoots, shows and run-ins, but Coddington's work lacks the emotional draw of most memoirs. While her story is glamorous - from growing up in austere Welsh surroundings to being transported to the glitzy world of London fashion - the writing is choppy and blunt. She delivers some of life's most moving moments, like countless husbands and lovers, failed relationships and pregnancy, nearly devoid of emotion. But the book provides an interesting glimpse into the life of someone who's early love of picture books foreshadowed a monumental career in visual storytelling, both in front of and behind the camera. Her unique ability to capture fashion combined with a sense of place is what sets her apart.

B005J2UM9S|2.0|This movie actually starts out with a very promising setup.  A \\"ghost hunting\\" squad decides to spend a night in a haunted asylum to find \\"proof\\" of the supernatural.  This actually works really well in a satirical sense, as far as dealing with the usual \\"Ghost Hunters\\" or \\"Finding Bigfoot\\" fare.  Of course, they actually do find the supernatural, and the movie falls apart after that.<br />  The initial quarter to third of the movies is REALLY well done with the build up.  The slow tour through the asylum, the fake interviews, the general build up of atmosphere in the hospital, AND, the build up of characters you want to see off'ed and a few you want to see survive, all make for a promising 1.5 hours.<br />  Once the proverbial crap hits the fan, though, entertainment dies much faster than the movie characters.  While the occasional morph of a normal looking \\"human\\" ghost to \\"ghoul\\" is eerie and hair raising, the vast, and I mean VAST, majority of the rest of the film is the \\"film crew\\" wandering the empty hallways.  There is even a blatant rip off of the end scene of the original Paranormal Activity, although, sadly, the movie continues after this.  Once the CGI hands appear, good luck not viewing this as an unintentional comedy.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting story and very well written. I would highly recommend this book to any one looking for a good science fiction novel.

B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I like a police procedural that makes you think as Broadchurch does. David Tennant plays a tortured soul of a inspector who is cast upon a close knit community only to have a murder on his first day on the job.<br /><br />While a long time fan of British television I can understand most what is spoken on a lot of the shows but for this one I have to turn on closed captioning in order to understand what is being said as the brough is so thick.

0439023521|2.0|The book I purchased was used and it first appeared in good condition but the binding quickly fell apart and caused the front cover to come off.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I really loved this book. I liked how it was in Joeys point if view and it gave you a better look on the war. Remembering world war 2 is always depressing and not hopeful. But this story was all about hope an faith. You forget that an animal or anyone can push you to do great things. This story gives me hope for the human race and it's future.<br />-Kennedy
140006922X|5.0|A very nonsensical presentation, easy to read, brings history's side of Jesus to the forefront. It takes off the hard things to believe about the romanticism of the Bible.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Not so good.just to pass a valuable time.could be .ore e entertaining.my time cold b spent as where c good luck n d future
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It's a great product! I have tried before this, Several this kind products, mobile and desktop, but no one is even similar to Tubemate!
0470901071|5.0|Comes in good condition and it help me to study for network certifies and help me for my network classes in the university.
0399255370|5.0|My grand daughters loved it and I did too. We liked how the boy resolved the issues of the crayons.
B00CX7TOTQ|5.0|The movie started off very chatty, then went into a duel of wits and endurance between DeNiro and Travolta, I don't want to give anything away but for ONCE - Hollywood DIDN'T follow the same old recipe.
0812983459|5.0|What is the spark in the human psyche that, when the world seems the darkest, whispers, \\"I know there is light.  Go find it\\"?  That is what propels Harold Fry as he sets out to mail a letter and doesn't stop at the mailbox.  While this is a story of redemption, it is the journey that is enthralling and poignant.
B001S86J2Q|3.0|expected the blu ray version would look better.  seems to be a bit grainy.  wanted it to have more clarity than the dvd.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I liked this app but when I saw the Xbox or computer version I loved it.<br />Get the Xbox or computer version of minecraft
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Love this show. It was the best show on syfy. Sad that it is gone. but it will never be forgotten!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's a fun game but it's almost impossible to get all the rewards in each room. Also some of the powerups are pointless & those are the ones you're given the most often.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are amazing in this very believable drama that offers a glimpse into the heart of politics in Washington and the lust for power.  Spacey's character Frank Underwood will stop at nothing (and I mean NOTHING) to get what he wants.  It is a dark, and at times sad vision of how morals can be corrupted for selfish ambitions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Found this quite challenging and look forward to new levels! Awesome! Will definitely tell my gaming friends to get this App and share in the fun!
B004UID2LC|1.0|On my family vacation to Disney world I was sitting in our hotel room watching a video not even downloading and the app froze. And my kindle fire never untrodden until ran out of battery and then never charged properly again. Best buy was amazing and gave me a new one but it took almost 2 months for me to regain what ialready had on my old one. all because of one app, never download!!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Set in modern London, a very young Sherlock Homes and Dr. Watson solve convoluted mysteries.  Unlike many other British series, I can usually understand what they are saying without turning on the closed captioning.  (Maybe I am just getting better at understanding the King's English.)
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|bought this movie for myself and i was very disappointed with it. when you play the movie it freezes within five minutes of starting.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Another amazing story of the Cousins' War. The plot will pull you in, and the ending came much too soon! I hope Ms. Gregory will have another novel to finish the story of Princess Elizabeth and Henry VII, and tell us of Prince Arthur's fate.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I love every book in the Delirium series.  I have never actually said this before but I wish this was a movie. The plot is excellent and very exciting. I stayed up way too late for a week reading the series.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is very addictive. It is challenging and has nice scene graphics. The day can quickly disappear when you are drawn into the challenges.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I love every book in the Delirium series. I have never actually said this before but I wish this was a movie. The plot is excellent and very exciting. I stayed up way too late for a week reading the series. I really really really wish there was a book 4!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I have been a fan since season one and this number 5 is, for me, the best. It is super funny often and some episodes are really great. To see Castle and Becket together, at last, is also refreshing.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I love every book in the Delirium series. I have never actually said this before but I wish this was a movie. The plot is excellent and very exciting. I stayed up way too late for a week reading the series. I really really really wish there was a book 4!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I never watched Dallas or Dynasty. Could it be similar? I don't know but a friend recommended it to me and I was hooked, even if so many things seem not credible. Beautiful landscapes, gorgeous clothes and good actors, what else do we need to be entertained? I ordered season 2 right away and cant wait to get season 3. It is always interesting to watch the &#34;special features&#34;. Afterwards.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of those rare books which are both beautifully written as well as an being a highly inspirational story. Holocaust stories have the potential to be highly traumatizing , this story enables the reader to understand many of the issues, while making the issues understandable to a youth( I've heard said that if you can explain a complex subject to a child them you truly understand it) . This book raises many questions & it's perfectly suited for stimulating discussions.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|It is a awesome game. I was playing it but it gets boring.so I gave it a three star rating.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|the game is cool in the options for your town but is somewhat difficult to run your town without active playing and constant winning in battles
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I purchased the chromecast after reading about the service. It seemed to good to be true. Intermittently it works great. When I first set it up, it streamed Netflix and You tube from my Mac laptop without any issues. However, the story goes bad after the first use.<br /><br />The next time I tried to use it, it only streamed video, not audio? I rebooted both the chromecast and the computer - no change - still video only for Netflix, but You Tube streamed video and audio fine. I searched for solutions and other than finding a lot of folks with similar problems, I can't seemed to find a solution.<br /><br />However, it does work with my iphone - audio and video streaming netflix - no problem.  I took a gamble as it was only $35 vs. $94 for Apple TV. I think it may be going back next week.<br /><br />Updated - raised to 4 stars. It now works better with my Mac Air but still a little clunky. Will keep.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I watched all the seasons as selfishly as i could. I felt a little  pathetic actually. i'll watch the next season with the same fervor im sure.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is amazing - required very little set up and downloading the app and getting Chromecast installed on the tv was very simple - definitely worth the price and also very simple to work.
1616551607|5.0|As most art books (especially by Amano) are overpriced and incomplete, this set is an absolute steal at $65. The art is reproduced with outstanding quality and given plenty of room to breathe on the page. My only complaint is that Squeenix doesn't make a modern game with this art direction!
B000HCO83G|4.0|We need to stand together in the fights we face - we need each other and to help create peace in our world
0767827902|5.0|I think this must be a real work of art by a very talented writer who knows how the real world works and is.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|My review of this purchase is mostly negative do to the quality of the file I received; not the movie itself.<br /><br />The movie itself was good; great performances by DiCaprio and MacGuire.<br /><br />However, all of that didn't matter much because the image quality was HORRIBLE. I specifically chose the HD version of this movie because this movie should be visually excellent. But the Amazon HD file was grainy and very pixelated. I ran it through a compliant Blu-ray player on a Sharp LED screen. Other files from Amazon have been fine but this one was bad. Stay away.
B004QBWU02|5.0|The telling of this story is so realistic and I just loved it.  So true to life as I remember how it was as a young man.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this for gaming....can't get a better mouse in this price range..highly recommended for any gamer with budget limitations...
B0073COMUW|5.0|I am a longtime user of CFL bulbs. I was buying them when they were $20 each. That said, I am a supporter of low-consumption bulbs.<br /><br />These are bright. Some people say too bright. And while I can't argue about the brightness, I will say these are best used in areas where they aren't directly shining on the room. So they are best in a lamp with a shade, etc..<br /><br />I had no difficulty installing them into my lamps.<br /><br />I have ordered 6 of these so far, all have worked out of the box.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|this is the best angry birds yet I cant put this game down everything is better about it. LOVE IT!
B00AHSF4AQ|5.0|Wanted to get the kids reaquainted to a true classic!  New big screen certainly helps the visuals and HD is amazing!
B0021L9MJG|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|Dawkins makes no effort in explaining things in a respectful manor.  All his arguments are stated very arrogantly and many times without full factual back up.  He often states thought experiments (such as probability and statistical logic games) that he tries to get the reader to assume are FACT without any critical thought of what he is arguing.  I'm not saying I don't agree with much of this book, but the way it is written makes it very inaccessible to the lay reader and frankly insulting to the non-lay person.
B0011UF792|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This was so much fun for a time killer. I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and my phone. It's perfect to pass the time.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Book was great and fast delivery on my kindle. Great pricing as well. Thanks team for your great work on this purchuse
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|City of Glass is again a great addition to the series.  The story lines are involving more characters and you have to keep reading as you need to find out what is going to happen.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Book was great and fast delivery on my kindle. Great pricing as well. Thanks team for your great work on this purchuse
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|City of Ashes is a great follow on from the Bone City.  The characters are all becoming more involved and you are getting more involved in the story
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|I almost took into account the terrible things I read about this CD, but I decided to ordered and I´m completely sure about something: those who are giving bad reviews are hurt fans of some \\"artists\\" that would never get the crown. And who knows...maybe \\"those artist\\" are behind of all this attack. The sound is great, like the other live Madonna albums, finally I have an entire 2 hours show on CD. You wouldn´t regret it.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|If you have ever watched Star Trek and seen Galaxy Quest, you will have a good starting base for this book.<br />you will laugh quite a bit while reading it. I enjoyed it and so will you
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|What I don't like of the DVD: they show the audience many times, putting the backstage scenes around 3 times, and a lot of superimposed images that Madonna started to used in the edition of DWT DVD. The rest is wonderful. I'm completely sure that those who are giving bad reviews are hurt fans of some \\"artists\\" that would never get the crown. And who knows...maybe \\"those artist\\" are behind of all this attack. By the way, if you have so much trouble with the Blu Ray the get the DVD.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like the app very much. It lets me know at a glance if it is charged and how much is left. Also lets me know how long I have for video playback and for games.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|I had it for my Iphone and I couldn't wait for it to come out on the kindle. My life is now complete :)
B00ECUARO8|1.0|I didn't understand the movie. Slow to start and slow to end. Took me two days to watch this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very well done series  .....I watch them over and over and always find something I missed the first time...can't wait till Jan!!!
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This movie was so good that I watched it twice back to back. I give it 5 stars because it has you on the edge of your seat until the very end...
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia Keys (AK) took her time with this album.  She conceptualized and was the executive producer of this album.  Her maturity shows and she shares some wisdom in the lyrics.  She is basically talking about the love she has around her and not to worry about what other people say about you.  Most of the album is great for easy listening.  There are some grown and sexy tracks that I added into my rotation for setting the mood.<br /><br />One reason why I purchased this album was Alicia Keys is the Creative Director for Blackberry.  I listen to her album from my Blackberry.  Check out my review of the Blackberry Z10.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Really great show. You think you know and then you have to pick a new favorite. The characters are awesome. I hope guffry explodes!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you think that the unimaginable could really happen then this is the show to watch. It's not that far fetched when you think about the New World Order and all the real events that, what used to be our government but is now a money grubbing corporation run by the wealthy elite, this series plays more like the real network news than what you see on tv every night.
B00BSW6F26|4.0|I read other reviews almost didnt buy but for. 99¢ i went ahead~ i liked the game- yeah there were no hints but thats what i liked I've played enough of these to know by now- tap~TAP~tap! And try everything.  Only thing that was a little annoying (only stating this as constructive criticism) there was no separate volume control for background music. Thats it  i'd buy again from this delevoper.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was good... Not great and not just ok.  I'm glad I waited for the rental and didn't go to the theater to see it (a good rental but not a blockbuster).
B007MQLL4E|5.0|Speaking the same language for important integration concepts is essential to ensuring a large development team can work together effectively. This book resonates with real experiences I have had over the last 12 years, and communicates complicated problems in simple ways that are very understandable.
B000FA5STS|4.0|I've read almost all of David Baldacci's books except a few early ones. Glad I chose this particular one. Very captivating with intrigue. Hard to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I really enjoy playing this game.  A lot of fun!!!  Great graphics and characters.  Really fun levels.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Looking at the cast, I thought this would be a funny parody of exotic vacation spots, but no so much.
B007V4LBLU|5.0|I love this movie. Written, directed and acted with a great outcome. Ewan McGregor is in one of his best roles ever..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy games like this, which make me think a bit, and solve problems. Looking forward to more levels. Just about the time I settled into paying, I finished with the available levels.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|This book flowed right along, I was finished before I knew it.  Always liked Duran Duran growing up and it was really interesting to read how it felt to be one of them.  Very interesting read.
B00F35BV64|5.0|It was absolutely fantastic. You don't need to be a Star Trek fan at all to enjoy it! Loved the fact that I could rent it :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game it is fun and it keeps me entertained I love my horse and the shows you train for
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book. I grew to know and love Vivian and Molly who had so much in common and to give each other. I highly recommend reading it.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|loved it better than the first one. I would watch again and would recommend this to you if you want a great action movie to watch.
1476712042|5.0|I LOVED this book!  I was drawn in, right from the first chapter!  I read the whole book in one day!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is the story of Travis Maddox and Abby Abernathy told from Abby's point of view.  They meet at college and have an intense, dangerous & addictive romance!  Travis is such an intense alpha male and a hot fighter to boot!<br /><br />I definitely rate this books 5*'s.  I read the book very quickly because once I started reading it, I forgot about everything else that was going on in my life and anything else that I was planning to do.<br /><br />(This is an excerpt from my full entry about this book published at Bec's Book Blog.)
B008CPQ8F6|4.0|Thought this movie was really rather good. Never heard much about it. I was working on the construction site when they filmed it. So therefore, I had to see the movie. It really surprised me. I don't understand why it didn't get better reviews. Would recommend this to anyone. Well maybe not little kids. There are some gruesome parts. But it is based on a  true story.
B00BVYU2P2|4.0|Selected this show to see if it might be a good fit for my 10-year-old daughter who is starting to experience the usual pre-teen drama.  Didn't realize it was an MTV production.  Definitely NOT for my 10-year-old daughter.  However, if you watch it for what it is, an over-exaggerated version of high school, then it can be pretty engaging.  Liked it, but would rather spend my time on a show that is more realistic.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I purchased this, It told more that I had anticipated. Unfortunately, I loaned it to someone and will likely never get it back. Will order it again one of these days. We need to be more mindful of what we are putting in our mouths. Actually we need to be more mindful of what is being sold to us at the stores! I still believe all the pesticides and chemicals are giving us all the diseases we are getting. All the Genetically Modified products need to go. Monstanto is the big company behind much of the modified corn.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved this book. I had gotten it expecting just the history of Tesla and there was plenty of that, but this book was so inspiring. I am an aspiring writer and I loved the huge amount of confidence this book filled  me with. It used such great details from Telsa's life to show how commitment and ambition can truly help you to achieve your dreams. I highly recommend this book.
B004JY0KP8|5.0|Love this watch.  It's my daily going to work/going out at night watch and is fantastic.  I also have a crocodile skin belt that matches it perfectly so that helps as well.  Great purchase.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|What a story. It had a lot of twists and turns but keeps you interested in the story. I really enjoyed it.
B007EECSFA|3.0|This is a book selected by one of our book club members. It just isn't a page turner for me.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|everyone should add me.  my id is EAICHJQ. I need as many friends as possible.  I love playing this game.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|but I did anyway. I am a big fan of the book and knew the move took liberties with it so I should have know I was not going to like the movie. Over all it is not bad as a zombie movie. It is just that the book is so much better and tells a far greater story. I thought the acting was ok. It was just the story was kind of bland. As the narrator goes on his trips it all seems kind of forced.. I ended up fast forwarding through some of the parts because I was not that entertained.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|I thought TesseracT was good with their album &#34;One&#34;, but this album blew me away!!! Hands down their best work yet!
B005LAIH2C|1.0|This movie sucked big time.  Sorry, that's not very literary writing for a movie review, but it is the truth.  I thought this movie would take itself a little more seriously...even Jack the Giant Slayer is more watchable than this - ditto any of the recent Snow White movies, or the Red Riding Hood movie.  But this?  It's nothing more than a violent video game with cheesy action hero one-liners tossed in!<br /><br />Okay, calm down. First of all, the plot:  Hansel and Gretel have a bad \\"witch experience\\" as children (as we all know, it's how the story goes...)so during their adult lives, they decide to embark on revenge on all witches.  Basically, that's it.  There's a tiny bit more, but I won't be a spoiler - not that it matters anyway, since you should not go anywhere near this movie to begin with!<br /><br />There is basically ZERO character development in this version of the story - there is no interesting back story involving any of the witches - just 2 leather clad cool hip vigilante witch hunters who swear an awful lot for mideival times, along with toting huge assault rifles - not very interesting weaponry for a supposedly magical era, right?<br /><br />This movie is such a bad clich&eacute;!  The funny thing is, I don't believe it was supposed to actually be a spoof!  There is even the sexy \\"good witch\\" thrown in for the guys to drool over, along with the requisite view of her naked (oh please!  All women are groaning inwardly over this part).<br /><br />Violence and objectification of women, anyone?  If that's your cup of tea.  Lots of innocent women were burned at the stake during the infamous witch hunts....oh forget it. I guess nobody cares about that.  How uncool of me to bring it up!<br /><br />This movie is mostly blood and violence for the sake of showing blood and violence (think \\"D'Jango, with witches\\").  Some people say the visuals are great.  Well, I guess they are...unfortunately, good visuals don't make up for weak uninspired writing.<br /><br />No matter what you do, Do NOT let your children see this movie!!!  It just may scar them for life.  What happened to making just a nice interesting movie where you actually get to know the main characters, and maybe even (gasp!) like them?  These 2 main characters are not likable at all.  They are only 2-dimensional cartoon characters who you could care less about.<br /><br />I guess I have expressed myself enough here.  I do NOT recommend this movie - not even for a PPV...not even if someone hands it to you for free - or pays YOU to watch it.  Walk...no RUN in the opposite direction!atter what you do, Do NOT let your children see this movie!!!  It just may scar them for life.

B007IK44CK|1.0|It started out good but don't appreciate movies that are not 100% good, wholesome and clean and this was not.
B00F91H15W|1.0|One of the worse I've seen in a long time. Total waste of time. It is not worth one star.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can't add much to what has already been reviewed. Chromecast sets up in less than 5 minutes. It does what Google claims it will do. Don't expect it to do other than what it is intended. It streams to TV. It is a streaming device not a mirroring device. It accomplishes what it is intended to accomplish in the Google fashion - extremely well. We consumers are benefiting from the Google-Apple competition but this is not an Apple TV CLONE. Read and analyze the reviews written by actual users not those who diss a product because they are loyal to a competing product. Apple TV and Chromecast are two different devices accomplishing the intended purpose of each.
B00138F57G|4.0|I have several of his cds, but this is the first I have reviewed. He has such a beautiful voice. I have others I like more; therefore, the rating of 4. I love music in general, especially jazz. I think the reason I love his music is because I can truly appreciate his voice as a wonderful instrument (strong, passionate, and not nasal)  as I don't understand the words and don't even try to follow along. His English cds are ok, but the ones in Spanish are exotic sounding and wonderful.<br /><br /> I have looked up the translations to several songs just to see what they are about. (Side note: It would be nice to have a digital booklet with words and translations for us fans that do not speak Spanish that well.) (Additional side note: He should try a cd of standards with his unique touch. He did a great version of a Stevie Wonder song and I still like &#34;I'd Like to Make It With You&#34;. I think his English cds would do better if the material was better.) But then again, why mess with a good thing.

B00CSCJ09K|5.0|This is wonderful! The music is fabulous and the musician is eye candy!!! Bravo David!! I have a few of his CD's and this is wonderful!!
B008MM9630|5.0|I like that you can rely on magic to revive plants that die--also that I do not have to rely on neighbors to level up.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I read this book because my book club selected it.  I had never heard of the author or the book, but was pleasantly surprised.  It took about 30 pages to grab my interest, but then I couldn't put it down.  The author definitely did her research and included a good amount of historical detail.  It was a subject I had no knowledge about and was glad to learn more.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|It keeps you thinking. Also finger co-ordination has to work with intelligence.  It helps me to relax.  It's for all ages.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Glad I rented this on amazon prime,  I would have been upset to pay full fare on this so so flick
B000YMM3CC|5.0|That's my favorite love story movie! I like everything about it! Ryan and Rachel did a good job! I hope more moves like this are going to be on the market soon.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I was so excited when this movie finally came out to watch in my home.  It's funny and has strong family morals and teachings.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|This DVD rocks! Great set list to highlight nearly 40 years of outstanding music.  Loved it and looking forward to more to come from one of the top rock bands of my lifetime.
B000031XCR|4.0|It's basically a greatest hits cd + several awesome new songs.<br /><br />This album is great to relax to. Celine has a very beautiful and soothing, yet powerful voice, and she displays her talent openly on this cd. Listening to it is almost like reliving the first 10 years of Celine's career.<br /><br />I am amazed at how she is able to just tell the story in each song, which is something that many of the newer artists are not able to do. You can tell she means what she is singing in each song, and that makes each song more meaningful.<br /><br />One unfortunate absence from this CD is her duet with Andrea Bocelli on the song \\"The Prayer\\". I had hoped that it was on this CD, but it wasn't.<br /><br />The newer songs for Celine that are on this album are: 'That's the Way It Is', 'If Walls Could Talk', 'The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face', 'All the Way', 'Then You Look at Me', 'I Want You to Need Me', and 'Live'. All of these 'new' songs are wonderful. I especially like 'Then You Look at Me'. It's just absolutely beautiful and pure. Anyone can probably relate to the lyrics of this song and enjoy the beauty of it. (It was written by Jennings and Horner, the dynamic duo behind 'My Heart Will Go On', so it's a song that would probably be Oscar-worthy except it wasn't part of a movie.)<br /><br />Definitely get this album, especially if you are a Celine fan.

0446608955|5.0|It took me less than a weekend to read this book...and it was a very busy weekend. Somehow, I couldn't put it down. The story of Jamie Sullivan, the awkward daughter of a widowed Baptist minister in the 1950s, and Landon Carter, the popular son of a US Congressman, is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />They begin as absolute opposites...she's the shy, sweet girl who everyone makes fun of in school. He's the guy everyone wants to be friends with. They end up having the leading parts in the Christmas play, and their friendship begins to evolve. It turns into love, but then a heartbreaking discovery may split them forever.<br /><br />This is a walk everyone should take, but be prepared with plenty of tissues.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks did an excellent job describing the settings and happenings of the book. I'd never read a book by him before, but now I'm contemplating checking out some of his other books.
B000002J2D|5.0|Amazingly enough, I wasn't a hugh fan of Genesis when Peter Gabriel left, but I am now and can imagine the trepidation of who was going to replace him and would the music change? I really love this album, it's one of my favorites. It's still very prog Genesis (because as we all know, Phil went more and more R&B as time went on) with absolutely beautiful compositions such as &#34;Snowbound&#34;. One of their best IMHO.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Affirmation is absolutely, spontaneously fantastic. It has the perfect blend of love songs and fun songs.<br /><br />\\"Affirmation,\\" the title track, is a wonderful self-affirming song. It's also kind of funny, too. It basically states, this is what I believe and you can't really change that.<br /><br />Then, there's \\"I Knew I Loved You\\" which is such a touching love song. I swear, that song has got to be about total soulmates who know before they meet that they're destined to be together.<br /><br />\\"Crash and Burn\\" shows that even if you are having a hard time, there is always someone who cares. It kind of makes me think of how you can just crash on your friend's bed and spill out all of your problems and he or she will listen and help you out.<br /><br />Affirmation is incredible!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I've read just about every book that John Grisham has ever written, and every time I reach the conclusion of one of his books, I always ask myself the same question:<br /><br />Why would ANYBODY ever want to be a lawyer?<br /><br />Although Grisham has definitely payed his bills writing legal thrillers, you can't help but wonder just what it is about the law that fascinates him.  Perhaps it's the darker side of the profession - he was once a practicing lawyer, so I guess he just enjoys the morbid aspects of it.  If you've read a lot of Grisham's books, you can't help but feel as though you're wandering in familiar territory whenever you read one of his newer releases.  I guess there's only so much you can write about crooked lawyers, sleazy tort attorneys, long hours in the law office and the occasional \\"good\\" guy that gets fed up with the system and has some sort of moral epiphany and then tries to change the world.<br /><br />Such is the character of David Zinc.  Zinc is a young bond attorney in his early thirties with a beautiful wife and no children.  They don't have time for children.  No one in this fictitious Chicago firm does.  They work too many hours, don't have time to eat, and are discouraged from even looking out the window (how can you bill a client for an hour if you're wasting time looking out the window?)  So one day, David snaps.  He then goes on a late morning drinking binge, and then finds himself at the doorstep of Finley & Figg - a classic bottom of the barrel law office where the two attorneys deal with the lowest of the low on Chicago's south side, and literally fantasize about the sound of an ambulance.  David isn't needed here.  Heck, the two sleazeball lawyers couldn't even afford him, even if they wanted him.  But he makes a cozy enough arrangement, agreeing he doesn't need to be paid much, and that he'll bring in his own business.<br /><br />Of these two nutcase litigators, Wally Figg is the more dynamic of the two.  Dynamic in  that he's always looking for the big break, the next big class action lawsuit, the next dangerous drug where he can bring about a damaging case, instantly win millions and retire from this gruesome profession for good.  He sort of takes David under his wing, and the action begins.  They get a \\"lead\\" about a cholesterol drug called Kraayox that has a bit of an unsavory reputation, and so the fun begins.<br /><br />So Grisham takes us on a wild ride into the territories of David fighting Goliath.  Goliath in this case, probably in any case, is a large pharmaceutical company that regularly keeps a cupboard filled with high priced lawyers of their own to handle such distractions, as they do happen quite a bit.  So we watch the process unfold.  This is where Grisham's true gift as an author really lies.  It's not the subject matter that resonates so well with his readers, but his story telling ability.  Grisham knows how to keep the reader engaged and to keep them turning pages well after bed time.  There have been many times where I have been dissatisfied with an ending of a Grisham book, but I'm rarely disappointed while the ride is still in motion.  Although, as I mentioned, he doesn't paint the legal profession very kindly, you always enjoy all of the plot twists and turns and the majority of characters that come alive through the pages.  Grisham even manages to make you laugh quite a bit, and this book seemed to be one of the more humorous ones in his catalog.<br /><br />So needless to say, this book isn't that much different from everything else the man has written in the last quarter of a century (yes, it's been about that long), but if you've enjoyed the majority of Grisham's novels, this one is right up there with the rest in terms of enjoyability.  Odds are, you won't remember much about the story a few years after you're done with the book, but it's a nice journey all the same.s always looking for the big break, the next big class action lawsuit, the next dangerous drug where he can bring about a damaging case, instantly win millions and retire from this gruesome profession for good.

0679746048|5.0|Sanity is something most people cling to like a security blanket. They think the \\"insane\\" people of the world don't cling to it also, but in the memoir of Susanna Kaysen, you see that she does.<br /><br />All she wanted was to be a normal girl, but when normality abandoned her, she had to check herself into McLean hospital to figure out how to regain it. After spending a year and a half in the hospital, she left with no great advice to give on how to live her life or with a realization of what the meaning of life is. This doesn't mean that she learned nothing. Far from that. She learned more than almost anyone else did.<br /><br />She learned how to survive. Not how to live, but how to survive. No one can be taught in a hospital about how to live, because the whole essence of the hospital prevents the person from living their life.<br /><br />When the money ran out, she was kicked out of the hospital. This, sadly, is how the system works. Of course, she'd only expected to be in there for a couple of weeks. Weeks had turned into months and months into years, and by the time she was released, she thought she was a forever patient.<br /><br />She made friends with the other members of the ward, because all of them had been doomed to longer than expected stays. They were a tight group. A group of people who cared for one another, took care of one another, but also aggrivated each other in so many ways.<br /><br />I wanted to read this book for two reasons:<br /><br />1.) I loved the movie it was based on. It's a bit different. Some of the scenes are the same, and if you've already seen the movie, you'll be picturing the characters doing certain things as you read about them in the book.<br /><br />2.) Susanna was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is my diagnosis. I wanted to see how she (at the same age) handled the diagnosis. I see many similarities in the diagnosis, as well as differences. I also saw many differences/similarities in our psych hospital experiences.<br /><br />I love this book, and I think it is very well-written. I am glad that Susanna decided to share her story with everyone. Maybe a book like this will better help more people to understand mental illness.tal experiences.<br /><br />I love this book, and I think it is very well-written.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|First thing's first: This is not, contrary to what many people believe, the companion piece to the Steven Spielberg movie that came out not too long ago.  Spielberg gives acknowledgements to the author, Doris Kearns Goodwin, in the movie's credits, and the cover of the book is a shot of Lincoln from the movie, but the similarities, strangely, end there.  I'm thinking Spielberg was probably so heavily influenced by this wonderful work, that he felt he needed to recognize Goodwin for the inspiration.  If you haven't seen the film, it really isn't a retrospective of the 16th president, but only focuses on the politics behind the Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery that was pushed through in the final days of the Civil War.  This book touches on this particular event, but only slightly.  In fact, if your mind ever wanders while reading a book, you're likely to miss that event entirely.<br /><br />Neither is this book a detailed biography of Abraham Lincoln.  As the title implies, this book mainly focuses on several members of Lincoln's cabinet that were, at one point or another, rivals with one and other for the presidential office during the primaries of 1860, and how Lincoln was a brilliant leader who put all egos aside, mended the differences, and successfully lead the country through arguably the worst point of our nation's history.  It's no mistake that this man is often regarded as the greatest president ever of the United States.<br /><br />Initially, the book begins by focusing on Abraham Lincoln's candidacy for President in the 1860 election.  His rivals for the Republican nomination are all future members of his cabinet; New York's Henry Seward, Ohio's Salmon Chase, and Missouri's Edward Bates.  The author spends the bulk of the first quarter of this volume detailing all of these characters - not just Lincoln.  We are provided with a detailed overview of their lives, their families, their ambitions and their political comings and goings in lengthy detail.  This was a minor distraction for me, as I felt at times I was reading four separate biographies, and it was a bit hard to keep my focus.  Because of the nature of the relationship between these four individuals throughout Lincoln's presidency, however, such an in depth background was, in fact, necessary.<br /><br />Interestingly, of these four characters, Lincoln was the dark horse candidate.  Surprisingly, what propels him to the top is his calm, non-aggressive nature.  Unlike just about any other political candidate (in history?), Lincoln masters what Jesus Christ told us about retaliation - simply turn the other cheek.  He never gets sucked in to name calling, mud slinging, or character assassination, so unlike his political rivals, he can't possibly put a political foot in his mouth.  After the other candidates embarrass themselves out of being front runners, the humble, gangly Illinois lawyer manages to win the nomination, and then eventually, to everyone's surprise, the election of President of the United States.<br /><br />Of course, any book that details Lincoln's presidency will deal heavily with slavery, the threat of secession, and the inevitable bloody Civil War.  All of that is covered in detail here, yet even if you are very familiar with the people, places and events during this tumultuous time, you never feel as though you are bored from \\"hearing it all over again\\".  Goodwin has the incredible ability to tell a detailed, yet very interesting story (I've never read any of her other pieces yet, but I've seen her on many television documentaries).  Also, these events are all told through the eyes and heart of Abraham Lincoln himself.<br /><br />Again, the man was a political genius.  Humble throughout his entire life, he manages to always come out ahead of his rivals by simply being a calm, respectful steward of his office.  There are a lot of political back-stabbing amongst the cabinet, the generals, the senators, and the other movers and shakers,yet Lincoln always knows what buttons to push on all of these individuals to never alienate or humiliate them.  As his presidency progresses, some of the characters shift in and out of focus.  Bates, who becomes Lincoln's Attorney General, basically falls out of the picture, but other key cabinet members, such as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton are featured more prolifically.<br /><br />So with all of the major events taking place during the four years of Lincoln's presidency,  the main theme here is the president's character, and his ability to lead his cabinet - a cabinet that didn't always see eye to eye, and could be quite disrespectful towards their Commander in Chief at times.  Upon conclusion of reading this satisfying work, you can't help but thank God in heaven that we had arguably the best president in the history of our country during the time when we desperately needed one the most.yet Lincoln always knows what buttons to push on all of these individuals to never alienate or humiliate them.

B00BU2SIW4|1.0|I wont really waste much time on this review, but being a long time DM fan (from S&S), this is a very boring album, perhaps marginally better than Exciter. Martins voice is too prominent on the album and his crooning warble can be annoying as it overrides the main vocals. He also extends his backing vocals a little longer than Dave's, which makes it even more noticeable and irritating.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is not a read that can be skimmed quickly. There are so many plotlines and nuances that you have to digest each chapter in turn. This makes it a long read, but well worth it.<br /><br />I started reading after watching the tv series, and in thid book you can see where the tv series broke apart from the book, which made it a slower read even more. However the books storylines are much more intricate and I can't wait to start the third book!<br /><br />I've already downloaded it, and am going to start it now!

However, I felt the plot was just so damn over-complicated and unnecessarily 'clever', and also that it tried too hard to be cool and flashy. It's a shame. I got through the whole film, but haven't recommended it to any friends. 2.5/5*

This is one of them.<br /><br />This is a classic that was first published in 1965, but it's still going strong. The setting of the desert world and its ecology is fascinating, and the detail with which the author has created this world blows my mind. He has created not only a few characters, but makes a whole society come alive.<br /><br />Even the detailed appendices at the end of the book are fascinating. I would rate frank Herbert right up there with Isaac Asimov as one of the SciFi greats.<br /><br />Truly a masterpiece.

I thought Toby's and Leo's performance was fantastic ( and I hate Toby otherwise, I really do.) I like the way the director plays a spliced modern / period soundtrack in building the world of the roaring 20's, the movie was really enjoyable, and it really is entertaining.

B00EMJD6TC|4.0|********SPOILERS********<br />********SPOILERS********<br /><br />The movie tried to capitalize on the zombie-mania and appeal to two target audiences and ended up alienating both. That's not to say it's a bad movie, on it's own. In fact, it's very good. They probably made a mistake in buying the rights to world war Z and marketed it as such. It has absolutely nothing to do with the book and now it's highly unlikely that we'll ever see a true adaption of World War Z the book, which is an utterly fantastic read.<br /><br />That said, it's an excellent movie and stands on it's own. It probably needed to be rated R. It needed a bit more in terms of disturbing images. Not gore, as that gets redundant quickly, but it needed more to grab the audience and make them feel like you felt when you first watched 28 Days Later. It should have been given it's own name: The Zombie War. WW3. Z. So many names would have worked. That's practically all they took from Max Brook's book.<br /><br />***************Major Spoilers from the book --- Do NOT read if you ever intend to read the book**************<br /><br />Those of us who read the book will always think of what it could have been. Brad Pitt is a first rate actor and the cast was excellent. If it had been even a little faithful to the book it could have been incredible. Brad Pitt could have played the interviewer travelling in the new redefined world. We could have had flash backs and the most important stories could have been presented. It would have been fantastic on so many levels.<br /><br />Eventually, a movie will be made that is faithful to the book, just the way the LOTR was eventually made. It excluded some much loved and important chapters, but it was much longer.  The problem is it will probably take many, many years. Zombies will have to go out of vogue then come back in... we will be older and the world will have changed. Segments of technology and the intermingling of history in the book already seem dated. That will only increase as time passes.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book, written by a scholar who tries bravely to put in perspective the life and time of the man from Nazareth called Jesus. I grew up in a Christian home and a society dominated by Christian theology, ideology and imageries. The bible was seen as infallible. I went college and got the opportunity to study the Synoptic Gospels for academic purposes. I got to strip, analyze and synthesize the content of the gospels. I was so impressed by Jesus' teachings. In many cases the Church's interpretations of his teaching was not in congruence with my conclusions. From then I started to view the church the same way Jesus viewed the religious establishment during his time. I also came to a better understanding of the gospels when I was able to have an understanding of the authors' purpose for writing. Each had a different target audience but they all wrote with the purpose of convincing their audience that Jesus was no mere mortal. This book sought to separate the facts from the myths but it is almost impossible since most of what we know come from the gospels. In the end it is not conclusive but it clearly shows that the gospels are not really \\"gospel' in terms of infallibility. As a historian, I am cognizant of the fact that history sometimes gets muddled with myths and legends, especially when the stories are passed down orally. From all verifiable accounts, the gospels were written at least three generations after the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth. It is well in the scope of rational thinking to conclude that the gospels contain many myths and legends. This book has done a very good job of dissecting the gospels and sifting out the myths and legends from the facts. In the final analysis, when all the embellishments have been stripped away; Jesus of Nazareth is still a remarkable historical figure. His teachings are ageless and relevant even now. In support of full disclosure, Reza Aslan has the responsibility to critically analyze Islam as well. I wonder how Muslims would react to such a critical analysis of Islam.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|A little less of Jane Austin summarizing the story here and there and a little more of the characters telling their own, made this book more satisfying. After reading Miss Austin's books, I'm left wishing for a little more gentility in the world today.

B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Save your money. This book is tediously written and totally predictable.  The characters and dialogue are unbelievably dull.The writing is amateurish. The storyline too farfetched.  I could not even finish this book. One of the worst books ever.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This movie had Brad Pitt in it - therefore we thought it would be OK even though it had only a one star rating. We were wrong. He should never have lent his time, name or energy to this thing. It only hurt his image and credibility in my eyes.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|Very Smart!  I have not seen a good movie in a long time!  Rented it then purchased it!  Love the mystery and effects!
B007CKNX28|5.0|I love the music. I had seen the movie which drove me to make the purchase. And I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a good price. My item was received on time and in great condition as described. I am happy with the service and would purchase again from the seller. I look forward to seeing what else they have to offer. I will enjoy my CD I am sure for a long time to come.<br /><br />Thank you much!<br />-A Happy Customer
B004G600A4|3.0|I needed the movie for research purposes.  It was adequate for the purpose.  It skipped. A disappointment but it served the purpose.

B00A8ECU24|2.0|Its a great app! But not for my Kindle fire. I have it on my phone and the only problem is the amount of power it takes.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a GREAT app!<br />It is very easy to use<br />I would recommend it to anyone<br />GREAT FOR KIDS!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very quick read! I would read it again and recommend it to people!! I loved the characters and the interactions with each other!!!
B001EBWING|5.0|Best movie ever made. I could watch it every day, war, intrigue, romance and some of the best lines ever.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the comedy it there were time when I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt!! I'd read it again!!!
B000SW2F6M|5.0|Love the story and special effects. They've taken some liberties with actual history, but it's now supposed to be a documenatry.
B004WR125O|5.0|great!it elimanated wires and cables.once set up,i've had no problems whatsoever.perfect accessory to my new receiver.there is a youtube video that helps explain set-up.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|My dad got this for me as a gift.  I set it up and it worked great, the first day.  The next day, it would tell me it was connected to a blank wireless but couldn't access the internet.  I checked with my wireless router and saw that it was on the proper network (but it thought the network name was null), and had an IP.  But it wouldn't work.  And the Chromecast app couldn't connect to it either.  It was essentially dead and useless.  Total POS.<br /><br />Oh, and if you have a Mac, you don't need it.  Just get an HDMI cable and connect your laptop straight to your TV (you can even go into Audio settings and send audio to the TV as well)
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game. It has lots of variety to it. I suggest that you get the game. You will have loads of fun, trust me
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The sex is interesting but the way their love blossoms is truly the center of the story. The peeling of an onion...the revelation of love unknown that is the core of Ana  and Christians love.
B00C2UUB9Q|5.0|Steve Wozniak tells his story in an intimate, personal way. His delightful personality often hides his genius and he tends to downplay the massive impact he has had on the way we live our lives. This thoroughly enjoyable book is easy to read, and the insights into the history of the genesis of Apple were profound. Steve has lived an inspirational life and his generosity has helped shape our world. This book provides an essential balance to the story of Apple, and is well worth the read!
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|I couldn't get more than 5 minutes into the pilot. The acting was bad and the plot stupid. But you might like it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is great for all the people out there who want a challenge. I hope they come out with more levels that we can play
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game and am patient so I don't pay to play. Was doing well-had collections and friends but last night the game updated and went all the way to the beginning so I have nothing. Have to start over from the beginning. This is not the only app like this I have had issuses with but this same game crashed on my phone too. Very frustrating to be doing well and have to start over. Not easy to find the same friends. Not happy about putting all the time in the game for this to happen. Is this their way of getting me to pay for items to get back to where I was faster?
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie so much. ive at least watched it 7 times. buy this movie. it is so awesome.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I had a dying kindle cord.  (Fraying)...  Now I have two spares.  I use these on several devices around the house.  Well made.  Thanks.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I loved this adaptation, the acting was very well done and I found it one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen...
B0091LS07E|3.0|I thought I was really going like this one.  I couldn't get into the other songs.  Only the title song did it for me.
B00C061I1M|5.0|My first listen reminded me of my first experience of listening to Bob Dylan back in 1963. Her voice shocked me at first, but listening to her at length gave me a sense of listening to someone sing on a back porch in Tennessee...except for the excellent band behind her. Her voice is somewhat raw and reminds me of Emilie Clepper's singing (check out \\"[[ASIN:B0016COZK2 Things May Come]],\\" which I also reviewed). In addition, she is no slouch in the songwriting department. And don't miss her iTunes festival concert available at the iTunes store. But do yourself a favor and get the CD; the sound is always better from CDs than from compressed downloads. In any case, here you get both for about the same price.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I use this at work, when I finely get down to 1 hour remaining.  It easy to use handy and compact - I've had no problems.<br />It can also be carried in my purse or laptop bag because it makes it easier to recharge if I happen to land someone place for a 90 minutes stay that its not needed.
B00E0SX118|4.0|I think the cartoon is well put together although a lot of the story is geared for teens and I'm not sure how many teens went to actually watch this show when it came out. My 10 yr old got really in to it but my 4yr old decided he wanted to watch something else on my ipad.
B00DRGQZRG|5.0|Is not exactly a Dave Holland record , is a CD of two young musicians; Craig Taborn, Eric Harland, and two masters; Kevin Eubanks and Dave Holland. Is a combination of sensations and feelings. Someone say is a \\"fusion\\" album ,  could be but I dint think so. For me  is electric jazz, that is different . Holland come back to Miles era, and the other ones create a world of feelings, music from different times and different generations, but great music. Three are from Eubanks, and two from Holland, Taborn and Harland. Is the perfect prism that make different colors in each composition. You must buy as soon as you can. Is more than a surprise is a miracle.
B006IND5M8|2.0|Have to right something or no review. Extremely slow beginning. Not much makes sense in the movie. I guess not a big deal in a Sci-Fi movie. Harrison Ford's character and his relationship with his son has been used multiple times over the years in many a western. Pretty dumb aliens. Stereotypically \\"good\\" Indians. etc. etc. Yawn.
B00C6F61BE|5.0|This move isn't really an action packed thing, though there are a few action scenes.  It gradually builds a mysterious suspenseful story, and an unforgettable ending.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|full metal jacket is a classic vietnam war movie  It is sort of unique in that it plays like two seperate short stories with crossover characters.  It shows the brutality of 60's era boot camp.  Then switches gears to the horror of the 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam.
