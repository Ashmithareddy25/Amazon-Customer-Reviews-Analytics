B001VTTRC6|5.0|Excellent movie. Well acted throughout. Avoids Eastwood's sometimes off-key melodrama and sticks to the story which while somewhat improbable is so well acted that it all works.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|While this may not be an original storyline, it is so well done that you cannot help but like it!  You may also enjoy &#34;Flight of the Phoenix&#34; (2004 version) and the Jason Bourne movies.
B006ZT47O0|5.0|I love this group and listen to this CD and some of their other CDs as well and just can't seem to get enough of them. This group is just breathtaking with their music.
B00D3XAA4M|3.0|Exactly what the title says... Forty lovely places to visit and why you should.<br />Now, all the reader has to do is check the locales personally.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love the book.  Just when I thought I know what will happened next I was surprised......<br />Just keep on reading<br />Awesome book
B00BK5D95C|4.0|Title says it.<br /><br />Nice change up from the usual EDM I bang all day.<br /><br />Nice tunes!<br /><br />........<br /><br />Four more words required.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is an excellent college level dictionary, complete with list of definitions, synonyms and antonyms, word derivation, and any alternative spellings.  It is all that you want or will ever need in a dictionary.
B00C061HZY|5.0|So far this album has provided the soundtrack for the most connecting trip I've ever experienced with someone.<br /><br />Excellent album through and through. Glad they released on Vinyl as this was a ton of fun to listen to. You're just in the mode to sit down and listen to an album when it's on vinyl. It's an en devour, a process, and it was exceptional.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|This is a great entertaining movie.  I never get tired of watching it.  Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, all the supporting cast and the views from Monaco's High Corniche road and beach are what you need for an afternoon delight.
B00004Z459|5.0|Classic linkin park in their hay day! i reccomend this CD to anyone who loves electronica/ hip hop/ rock in its best artistic form.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It inspired me to go after a job that I thought was too lofty for me and I got it! Now there is discussion in only one months time of a promotion to a chief of staff position!! I have reflected a lot on sentiments shared in this book during my first few weeks on the job, all while taking on the huge task of being certified to adopt. (As a single woman, people!). Just a few months away from my 40th birthday and on a great path...reading Sheryl's words inspired me to keep leaning in towards my dreams at a time when I needed it!!!!!
B00DQ8GDV8|5.0|I found this an exceptionally interesting book filled with amazing theories, facts and information. I was gripped by the author's writing style and would thoroughly recommend this book.
B006INDGFE|3.0|After falling in the floor with I, I expected more (although I was told otherwise).  It was funny and worth the money.  Funnier than most movies that you can't watch with your kids, parents, or significant other.  It gets a star off because I expected more, and that is probably unfair.
B0017O1MIM|3.0|Despite knowing that I was buying a used product, do not expect the same with the box was damaged. One put the box, which by the way is wonderful, came well broken and deformed. A pity. because I am a collector is this fault is clearly visible and affects the whole aesthetic of this wonderful edition.
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|It's a smart product. Nuts & Screws use the metric system.It does come with instructions for balancing the unit. You have to figure it out for yourself... with a lot of help from YOUTUBE VIDEOS on balancing the unit. . All & all.... it does the job.  PATIENCE!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Wow This is so much fun!, I could not stop playing it.  I liked the origina, but this is so great!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love these books and will now read all her work! Great storyline and catches you right from the beginning. Awesome!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|I really like hidden object games and this is a pretty good one.  Seems to work pretty well on my KF. As others have mentioned the written story is a bit lengthy. I would still recommend.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|my family play the games and love it so I ask everyone to play the game and that's is how we do
B000KLRUKC|4.0|I bought this CD for Tebaldi's voice. There are several people on Youtube comparing different renditions of Aida, and I believe Tebaldi's to be the best. However, another Aida I can recommend is Zinka Milanov (the recording where she is paired with Jussi Bjorling - a superb Radames).<br />I have some issues with the conducting (hence four stars, not five), but this is still worth buying.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love being able to cast my browser tab or youtube video, or Google Play Movie to my 55&#34; Plasma.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Truly a modern classic trekkie movie. The packaging is great and the quality of the DVD's are both fantastic. I love this movie.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I was feeling down in the dumps so I decided to view something that would cheer me up.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen's The Dictator did the job.  The plot is outrageous and the dialogue is what you would expect of Cohen.<br /><br />In short, it did cheer me up.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|It's off camber but not for Kanye supporters like myself.<br /><br />It's also not college dropout, nor is it illuminati music.  (Whatever that is)<br /><br />The fact that this CD did so well w/o any real advertising is cool, but hopefully this is a precursor to a more mainstream or bigger Kanye CD to come.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|A wonderfully well written book. Loved their story. A shame her brother could not witness his sister taking charge of her life. Loved it.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Everyone loves a good throwback.  The action was great, the actor choice not bad, the script however was waiting for a better writer.<br /><br />However, if you like gangster flix, and ol' skool action it's worth watching.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Murder with a sense of humor.  This show is well written with a great cast.  It keeps you watching.  I look forward to checking out some of the other seasons.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|The CD cames in an awewsome timely packaged manner & in Superb condition. Love the CD as it takes me back to my youth & will definitley be shopping for more!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This is a true view inside Catholic monastic ideology and practice in days of yore. Is it still in effect today? Let's hope not!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Worked like a charm. Great App. I was able to free a lot of space from my internal storage. I reccomend it to everyone.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I love this show so much. I've always loved spy stuff and this sure beats Spy Kids. The acting is excellent, as is the plot and fight scenes. Watch this show! I had never heard of any of the cast members before but they do a great job!
B0035O66CO|4.0|No wonder Tatum won an award for her first picture.  The story and the script are crisp, fresh and devoid of sentimentality.  It is as sweet and believeable as the first time I saw it.  This would stand up to any movie made today.  Tatum steals it.  Pure entertainment.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock has become a larger than life figure. The shooting and production of what is perhaps his Magnum Opus - [[ASIN:B000ICXQXI Psycho]], has become the stuff of cinema legend. And, as with most legends, the truth is often obscured by myths or fables.<br /><br />Sadly, this is what happens with HITCHCOCK, the otherwise very enjoyable and light film from director [[ASIN:B002Y31MK8 Sacha Gervasi]], who gives us a stellar cast and excellent cinematography.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002CMV1N4 Anthony Hopkins]] is almost unrecognizable in heavy prosthetics and a fat-suit. The Oscar winning thespian absolutely NAILS Hitchcock's eccentric mannerisms and quirks, and the accent is spot on. Hopkins brings Hitch's signature dark humor and wit to the film (\\"Try the finger sandwiches, ma'am. They're real fingers.\\"), and boosts it with his chameleonic talent. This is one of cinema's greatest actors, and he is having a great time here.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006RXQ2CY Helen Mirren]] gives a excellent, and at times comedic, performance, a worthy counterpart to Hopkins's scene-stealing Hitchcock. [[ASIN:B001SKB1Y0 Scarlett Johansson]] plays a fine scream queen, but is far too pretty and not \\"60's\\" enough to play Hitchcock's Blonde [[ASIN:0792838289 Janet Leigh]]. But still not a bad performance at any rate. [[ASIN:B000K7VHQ4 Jessica Biel]] and Danny Huston play their roles well, but it is [[ASIN:B00CRWJ5GO James D'Arcy]] who absolutely _mesmerizes_ as Anthony Perkins; perfectly capturing Tony's nervous, boy-next-door charms while harbouring his darker, troubled psyche.<br /><br />On the whole, it is HITCHCOCK's fine, distinguished cast that elevates this above your average biopic. Good performances all round, and shoutouts and kudos to Sir Anthony and James D'Arcy!<br /><br />Other pros include great, retro cinematography, a good score and a light, airy, entertaining pace and tone. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with touches of black humour and odes to other Hitchcock films. The costumes and makeup (especially Hopkins's getup) are top notch, nabbing a deserved Oscar nod.<br /><br />Let's talk cons.<br /><br />So very little of what \\"happens\\" in this movie ABOUT the shooting of Psycho in 1960 is true. The infamous and utterly brilliant Shower Scene takes the brunt of the blows. Lies and myths abound, from Hitch's usage of cold water to make Leigh scream, to Saul Bass's direction of the scene, to Hitch himself wielding the knife, to even worse; tales of voyeurism, cruelty, obsession, and various odious behaviours. This is simply untrue, and pictures such as HITCHCOCK and THE GIRL paint an inaccurate portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock, arguably the greatest director that cinema has ever seen, or indeed, ever will see.<br /><br />The screenplay isn't even as \\"revealing\\" or \\"eye-opening\\" or \\"deep\\" as it should be, or thinks it should be, but the result is a light-hearted biopic rather than a heavy one. Another point that I did not like was the inclusion of the scenes with horrific serial killer Ed Gein (basis for Leatherface, Hannibal Lecter, Buffalo Bill, and worse). They didn't really fit the tone of the story, and all the \\"demons\\" they tried to give Hitchcock came off as cheesy.<br /><br />But that's not to say I didn't enjoy the film. I did immensely! We need more biopics of classic film directors, and the light-hearted, breezy approach that Sacha Gervasi takes should be applauded, even if the inaccuracies shouldn't.

B003TOMAPC|5.0|As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the best. Although I tend to not enjoy Mark Millar's over the top style, for Kick-Ass it worked and worked very well at that. If you enjoy a foul-mouthed, over the top, violent action super hero movie than this is perfect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best thing ever even the new one I recommend this to a four year old . I just do not like herobrine the meanest person ever !!!! But who is herobrine and is it you and you do not know it???? :-0
B001LF347E|5.0|I like Merlin the series. Very entertaining and original. I wish there were more shows like this.  Great for people of all ages.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|My first book by this author - I was intrigued by reading the blurb.  Usually, when I read a book with a \\"twist\\" or a \\"shocking\\" plot detail I am like \\"yawn, of course that's what was going to happen\\".  This is not the book of happy endings, but the ending felt gritty, real, and believable.  I loved some characters, I liked some others...and there was no one I completely hated even though there were some personal characteristics to hate on.  Gee, kinda like real people where there is a lot of gray area.<br /><br />One thing unclear to me from reading the blurb is that there are several stories going on in the book - Three women's husbands have a secret...and although these women have seemingly nothing to do with each other - their lives converge in some unexpected ways and I was thoroughly lost in their stories.  I would definitely read her again!
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|I like the show Merlin very entertaining to me. Though that last episode was a let down. The other episodes are great to watch.
0385523394|3.0|I read at least 100 reviews on Amazon after I ordered this book, and couldn't wait to form my own opinion of it, since the reviews I read were so similarly divided.  It seems that readers either hate Piper Kerman, or they love her in that general way that people do when it's the \\"right\\" thing to do.  I was neither in love with her nor hated her, but I did find most of her storytelling rather straightforward and not too self-aggrandizing, as many readers have expressed.  I think the facts that she is blond, went to Smith, and is totally unprepared for prison life is the POINT of the story.  She relates these facts in such a way that we understand her background, and if we understand it without jealousy, we realize that Smith is hardly training for any kind of sentence other than possibly jury duty.  I recognized gratitude in Kerman's explanations of the ways she was luckier than nearly every one she encounters in the book, but she also understands the ways she is favored and the ignorant reasons behind them (blond, white, etc.)<br /><br />The writing is decent.  I wasn't so interested that I couldn't put it down, but I read it within three days.  It does drag in some ways, and a lot of the story is bland in that way that makes a reader feel she is looking not through a window in Piper Kerman's life, but a screen.  My favorite thing about the book is recognizing the ways in which the creators of the Netflix series blend the characters in the story into more interesting, sensational characters without losing the authenticity of the book.
B005MJ883K|5.0|I a really good hobby, i love it, its in the living room for the visits and friends, buy it
B00633W614|3.0|The story moves pretty fast but in my opinion lacks depth and twists !! Part 1 was better. The knots were resolved too quickly and took away sustained suspense and thrill.. Will nevertheless wait for next part since it is Jeffrey Archer.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love it lol :) I use to play it on my iPhone but i got it for kindle and now i play it all the time :)
1613821395|3.0|It was not as neatly plotted as The Moonstone and became tiresome in spots.  I was disapointed, perhaps because The Moonstone, wich I had ead many years before, still held up on second eading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is over cool butt the better thing is it update like every 2 weeks but it need to be 5 stars instead of 4 1/2
B00422LESE|4.0|The book offers very good image of history of physics but it is highly speculative making just a brief and daring  proof of god un-existence based on un-proven physics theories (string theory and landscape theory currently improbable based on LHC results).
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is perfect for people both selling and buying items. You can easily find an item of your choice by just searching it and refining it to fit your needs.Totally recommended. A++++++++  app
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A must read for anyone who enjoys zombies like the walking dead or the remaining. It's an anthology of a fictional war against the zombies but it reads like a non-fiction.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love it!!!!!  Couldn't believe how easy to use to find WEATHER ALL over the globe.  Going to France soon and this is a great tool for knowing what to pack, time differences, etc.  Everyone should get this app!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game i check on my dragons hourly and i have a lot of the rare dragons<br />BEST GAME EVER
B00000JR29|5.0|the best gift to my mom!! she will be so happy<br />and the cd comes sooner than what i expect
B009AY04A8|4.0|Pirate adventures is fun to play with great graphics. There are 16 chapters of hidden object game play,either by silhouette or by name. You can play by timer or at your own pace. A great game that I got free through Amazon(thanks Amazon u r great) but I would gladly pay the $2.99!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|An absolute masterpiece! Excellent ORG and is challenging and fun! Also has a slight open world concept. A five star game! GET IT! YOU WILL NOT REGRET!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Great characters.  Enveloping story.  I felt like I was along for the ride, part of Walt's crew from beginning to end.  Incredibly descriptive and so easy to visualize every bit of scenery.  I started with the show on AMC, but am thrilled that the book is nothing like the show.  A million times better and much more entertaining.  Looking forward to starting the next one in the series.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I haven't watched my copy yet so I can't comment on whether the physical disc has any defects or not but I just wanted to comment on the film itself.  O.K. - if you're looking for Academy Award themes or performances you are going to be hugely disappointed.  What you have to do is suspend any sense of common belief, I mean after a wreck how do these cars get repaired and ready to go by sunrise?  How does a U.S. Federal agent get away with telling the police chief \\"Stay the f*** out of my way\\".  How does the right car needed show up magically?  Even Dominic Toretto couldn't conjure cars up that quickly.  When was the last time you saw a story on the news about a bank vault being towed through the streets of Rio?  Like I said overlook the minor details and the movie is just great entertainment.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I love the music in the original Wizard of Oz.  I miss that.  The story line was very good otherwise.  Still scary for the little ones.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I always love NCIS. After Ziva leaves, I am not sure if I will love it as much. Go NCIS
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|Downloaded just to try for my Kindle 8.7&quot;. Opened it, messed around a bit, and seems to work just fine.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|It's definitely not the same as the book. With that said, I never expect movies to live up to the book because they never will. Some do the book justice and are great movies. Some differ from the book greatly but if viewed as just a movie are still pretty entertaining. That's where this one falls for me. Nothing like the book but still entertaining. But if you are looking go see what you read, don't watch it. You  just upset yourself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the fact that they always keep on updating you could bake cake,and on creative they have spawn eggs how fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game so far I just got it so I love it. I would like to see horse eat treats and food. Overall I give  it 4 needs work but it is fun.
B0011Z0ZZS|5.0|What can' this man sing? I love the smoothness of his voice and the way he delivers a song. Wonderful.
0307271080|5.0|A very good novel .When you start reading it, you like to read more. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a good writer.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|I love this classic Disney movie. My girls had never seen it and suddenly I thought Disney might put this in the vault, and I won't be able to see this wonderful story with them. Glad to find it.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I have not yet used the HOMM4 portion of this disk - I bought it specifically for HOMM3.  It works great, and I use it on an old refurbished Dell with Windows 7.  There is a pause here and there, hardly noticeable, but otherwise it works spectacularly.  It gives you a warning about not having enough space, despite showing you clearly upon installation that you have acres of space to run the game.  I ignored it, and have had no problems.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great to do business with  & will order from them again if they have what I am wanting to buy
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I first saw this concert on PBS, and was blown away by the Music, singing, production everything. I had recorded it on  my DVR and waited several weeks before I watched it. I was not  anxious to play it ,but when I did  I was enthralled. I bought the DVD for my son  so he wouldn't have to fast forward through all the pledge breaks !  It arrived a week late for his birthday, but he was delighted with it.  I have read reviews that have really put down the casting of Nick Jonas, and made unkind comments about his voice. That was so unwarranted. He did a good job, and looked the part .He blended very well with Cossette. All the Singers were Fantastic, especially Alfie Boe.  I had never heard of him before, but I certainly have since. Great voice, nice personality.  All .around great DVD. I am very pleased with it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great to do business with  & will order from them again if they have what I am wanting to buy
0143124544|5.0|What a fantastic book!  Could NOT put it down.  Excellent character development - it was funny - british humour had me laughing out loud but at the same time was sobbing by the end of the book!  A MUST read - what are you waiting for?  Order it.  You will be finished in 2 days!
1594203334|5.0|This book is a must for anyone considering parenting. The methods discussed in this book resonated with me so strongly; I hope to parent like the French. I could see how some of the methods would be controversial in America, but the idea of having children sleep though the night almost immediately, eat everything, and behave well in public are too tempting not to try. I ordered a copy to own immediately after finishing this library book.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was an excellent piece about a historic recording studio. Learned alot and really enjoyed the story. It was great how it had touched so many great bands and the sound board continues working today.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|It's a little weird making two monkeys punch each other.  I haven't been able to effectively block punches and once I start punching the opponent monkey he can't seem to block my monkey either.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love great violin playing, but they are usually classical music.  This one is just fun and wonderful.  Wish I could see her dancing while she plays.  Lindsey is amazing.
B005LAIH54|5.0|Enjoyed every minute. My grand kids even liked it. It made for a very nice family evening with good ole popcorn.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys play beautiful music with lots of soul and feeling.  I am impressed with their style and quality.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|We had seen this movie before & laughed so much. I had to get it so we can watch anytime we want. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman the whole cast was funny, entertaining. Great movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan's body of knowledge regarding the history of the period in which Jesus lived, and the culture and traditions surrounding that time, is impressive. It is well-written and backed up with couintless references to which one can refer. Traces the changes which have taken place over time that have created a modern-day understanding of Jesus that has significantly altered the Jesus of 2 millenia ago. It answered for me why so many current beliefs seem to make no sense and were in numerous cases contradictory in the many versions of Jesus' life and works, all of them written by individuals who never knew him. I heartily recommend this book, no matter what your religious or spiritual procliviities happen to be.
0439023491|5.0|This book is a awesome continuation of book 1. By the end of it it is nicely leading you into book 3 ( good set-up) makes you want to jump right into book three. I hope the movie is as good as the book (coming out Nov 22nd,2013.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love playing it and it is a great thing to do when youre bored so if you are ever bored out of your mind do this.
B000YHG72E|5.0|The new &#34;Classic&#34; Christmas movie. Even fun to watch whenever great movie all around. Typical Will Ferrell movie and good for the kiddos.
B004LROMWU|4.0|But nobody has a Boston accent and that bugs me quite a bit. How come their guns never run out of bullets.
B009EP3DJM|4.0|Well i bought this as a gift for my wife she is thrilled and loves it I don't so much but none the less its catchy
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Everyone could just imagine what they would do if they found a secret note/letter from their spouse that they weren't supposed to read....it would drive me crazy!  Story line is so interesting and you don't see it all coming together until the end.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I thought it was the worst one in the series. It only cobtains 2 months. I hope the next one is better. The rest of them are really good, though.
0375869026|5.0|I love to read and bought this book for myself because I'd heard it was excellent.  I absolutely loved it, couldn't put it down. This character -Auggie - I guarantee will be a new classic -talked about for years to come.  Talk about building compassion -I can only imagine how this book will affect child readers as it affected me.  It's so completely humbling, and real.  We can all deal with our daily problems after reading what this child overcomes on a daily basis.  I've now passed the book on to my 7 yr. old niece who's a bit mature for her age and an avid reader.  She's reading it with her mother alongside her.  I've already recommended this book to several other people.  When I was done reading it - I felt like I missed the characters.  That's how you know - it's something special.
6304696558|5.0|This is one of Goldie Hawn's funnies pictures.  My Grandchildren love it.  We could watch it all the time  and never grow tired of it.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Always happy to hear Corey Taylor and his other band. Great CD case, Great music, Great lyrics! What more can I say?
B002NXSRVG|5.0|The rise of cobra is a wonderful action packed movie that will keep your adrenaline pumping as they race to save the cities around the wordl from a evil mastermind with nano nuclear weapons. With tgis action movoe you also get some comedy relief. With a great cast this movie is for anyone who appreciates action, comedy, and sifi weapons.
B00DNLXDUW|2.0|Cant figure out how to get this app to work with 2 step verification on my GMAIL accounts. will consider updating review if this is available
B004LWZW4C|5.0|As an isnstallment of the xmen movies this may be the fifth in the series but it also is a prequel to the first X-Men movies as it tskes you through the first group of mutants that charles Xavier teaches to control their powers. It helps you get a better definition of how the mutants in the first movie became a part of the school and even helps learn about professor x's history. This is a must own movie to all comic book lovers and super hero movies.
B008476HBM|5.0|I enjoyed the read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic read.  Jane Austen is a favorite.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|If you love arnold schwarzenegger then this movie is an classic for you. This is the first installment of a four part movie collection for you who have seen this you will understand what I am saying and for all of you who are younger who love scifi movies with lots of action and some gore you will love this. It will be a great addition to your movie collection.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|We downloaded this game for my grandson, he is 10.  He really likes it and plays each time he visits.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is an interesting story and is very well written by Hosseini. The book helps you understand Afghanistan a little better.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie - had to re-watch some of the Hulk scenes as they were fantastic.<br />Thanks Amazon for getting this title on Amazon Prime.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the storyline and film. I hope there is a continuation to the next chapter of the story, going the \\"Their\\" Home.....
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I just love this movie! I need to watch it again and again to actually see it all. I miss stuff when I'm laughing so much!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|excellent service.it  came on time and in perfect condition. I am delighted with it. I love the Piano Guys music
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|I am not going to actually review this release per say, but ask a few questions (feel free to answer (constructively)).  Others have done great or poor jobs of giving it a real review.  Read through, it gets better as I go on.<br /><br />Who is \\"A Customer\\" -- I am suspicious of reviewers with out names.  Two \\"Stars\\" my a...<br /><br />Is anyone actually reviewing this new deluxe RI -- All the reviews seem as though they are reviewing the original 1996 release of TAFH.  Yes, they refer to the extreme 2013 price (as was the deluxe MCIS RI Box).  But I have not found any discussion of the added material, let alone the DVD concert.<br /><br />A specific question.  I did notice something really strange on CD disk 1.  Tracks 8 - 22 are listed as Gravity Studios Demos.  This is really odd, only about half of the songs seem to appear on the bootleg CDs with 29 songs.  Seems they recorded more than 29 such demos.  Or there are even more alternate or changed titles.<br /><br />\\"Movers And Shakirs\\"  2:41<br />\\"Blaster Caster\\"  1:07<br />\\"Little Ditty\\"  0:45<br />\\"Verily I Say\\"  0:51<br />\\"New Waver\\"  2:56<br />\\"Ravi Revi Roo\\"  3:23<br />\\"On The Lose\\"  1:27<br />\\"Slurry\\"  4:40<br /><br />These 8 songs or demo fragments on the new deluxe RI commercial Aeroplane Flies High set do not appear to be among the 29 titles I previously knew about and had.  Did Billy have more Gravity Demos stashed away?  Anyone know of a \\"Billy's Gravity Demos II\\" bootleg?<br /><br />Also during this period, 1994-96 did Billy have a thing about the numbers 28 and 29 (as to numbers of songs on releases)?<br /><br />In fact does Billy dislike his old song \\"Not Worth Asking\\" or something?  Never having given it a proper release.  I love it and happen to own the only as far as I know official release of it as a promotional B-side on a vinyl single (with the promo version of the Pisces Iscariot LP).  I play digital copies I've managed to find. I've only played the 45rpm record once.  This song should have been on the deluxe reissue of either SD or PI or now TAFH.  Other seemingly lost or rare now OP released SP studio recordings seem to be \\"Terrapin\\" and \\"Bullet Train to Osaka\\".<br /><br />This is a comment not a question.  Anyone who is really interested in very early Smashing Pumpkins material, say Gish or pre-Gish should check the internet for the Reel Time Studios recordings.  I found and have three \\"batches\\" of them, from 1988 and 1989.  Many early unreleased songs, early or alternate versions, and a few were the very ones released.  It varies a lot.  Important material.  Some more of this Reel Time Studios material has been trickling out on the various deluxe reissues the last two years, but when I first found them, I was ecstatic.  Peace.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|my kids love it.. just wish there were more FREE options on it. It is very easy for any age to use.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am hooked on the HBO series and started reading the books as a result. The books are so much more detailed and worth reading!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I just reread this book before I went to see the movie and I love it. Still just as entertaining as the first time I read it.
B007HO392S|5.0|I bought this album for my daughter, but really like it a lot as well.  We both trade off listening to it. Good Girl and Blow Away are my favorites.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is super addicting and fun I just wish there were more ways to get grew coins that would make it much easier.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Not a bad view to entertain.  Has a few problems, like what's with those Star Fleet dress uniforms? Otherwise would recommend.
0762445262|5.0|Epic I really love it, it's so damn cool. I  would recommend this product to anyone! Really lives up. Bit small though!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The books dive so deep into the world you can believe the history and feel for the characters as their lives unfold.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Don't let the creepy cover fool you--this book is hilarious.  If you enjoy/ed 30 Rock and Tina Fey's humor, you will find this book exceedingly good.  Thinking back, it seems to be an organized autobiographical stream-of-consciousness following her career from its inception in middle/high school all the way to-and-through 30 Rock.  Lots of \\"behind the scenes\\" stories from SNL and 30 Rock--the good and the bad--and all told in such a way that you feel like she is sitting across the table from you.  Get.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Whenever I try to use it, it kick me off my wireless network and I have to restart my router and unplug the device from my Television. This item is a bust and I want my money back.
0399162097|3.0|I love novels, big novels, or small, but ones that have a story. And, this book is so beautiful and crisp, but, there is no real story. I am put off that the timeline doesn't unfold in a more linear fashion, and that I have to guess about Fern and what has happened to her.  It would have helped if there were intriguing nuggets of information, some sort of tension, something to keep me turning the pages.  The book is mostly pages of narrative with very little dialogue -- so it was a slough to get through. I am intrigued by the author though and would try her again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Superb. Fast and interesting read.  Great cultural portraits and stories, vivid, somewhat tragic at times.  Clear out a few days.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|When you want to veg out and give yourself a break, angry birds does the trick.  So far I would recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I began watching the series on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I NEVER watch these types of shows but for some reason this is so captivating that I can't stop watching it.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids, who are 3 and 13, both loved this movie! It's great to keep everyone entertained, without being too scary or too thriller-esque. The ending where everyone dances was definitely a hit with the little ones! Very cute film!
B005LFQRTC|4.0|I was way too young to remember if I even saw the first 3 pilot movies of SMDM in the early 70s. They are included on this set and have not been shown as movies on TV since the early 80s.  This set includes: Cyborg (aka The Six Million Dollar Man), Wine, Women, and War, and Solid Gold Kidnapping.  All in their original 90 minute time slot broadcast versions. They were subsequently rebroadcast in syndication as 2 part episodes with extra footage added to better fill the single hour time slots as TV shows back then ran about 49 mins - 51 minutes each. The first film was only 75 minutes long so a \\"flashback\\" version (To The Moon and the Desert Parts 1 and 2) was created to fill in more time. Those versions are not included in this set but rather on a bonus disc set that was included in the TIME LIFE video collection box. The original versions as presented here are grainy and at times, very bright, especially the opening scenes of the 1st plot movie which occurs on a very sunny day where the blue sky is almost white washed. Still the transfer is great for both sound and picture. The actual first full season begins with the episode \\"Population Zero\\" which is the first episode of the regular season.  This is season set 1 of 5, each available separately (at time of review Season 4 and 5 are not or may not yet be available separately, if you haven't bought any season yet, its cheaper, if still available, to buy the box set from TIME-LIFE as it will also include the first 3 movies in their syndicated 2 part form, and the 1980s reunion movies, which included the debut of Sandra Bullock.
B00CTEMQLG|4.0|This show was an unexpected treat. I did not know what to expect but have been pleasantly surprised. The show is about the production of a Broadway musical from the &#34;ground up.&#34; It is entertaining and lively. I highly recommend &#34;Smash&#34; for anyone who loves musical theater. if you like Glee, then you will love Smash!
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Good book although I thought the first book in the trilogy &#34;Fall of giants&#34; was a better read. Still a great author!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The writer is amazing and I read all of his books. This book is good but I got a bit confused with the style and too many names. I was disappointed on how Abdullah was skipped to the end of the story and brought on as old. I was hoping we learn more about him.<br /><br />I do recommend the story for reading because it is interesting and sounded so real as if based on a true story.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could have read it all in one day if I had the time.  Loved it.  I will be reading more from this author n
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I loved Wreck it Ralph.  Both the movie, features, and packaging satisfied me.  My kids love the movie, and I cannot get my 3 yr old daughter to stop saying &#34;Are you a hobo?&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really stands out. I read a lot, and The Fault in Our Stars brought an emotional pull and was thought provoking that not many books have. Disclaimer: you WILL cry. But it's not a tear-jerked just for the sake of being sad, so it's ok.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game, really nice graphics, never freez... Love it it's like a real hours and you don't have to be there all the time.  I recommend it to family members with small children.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I thought this was a great app...until I found out I had to spend another $3.99 for the kindle fire (any tablet?) version. I switch between the two quite a bit and would have liked to have been able to either (1) use this one, (2) get the other for free or (3) even get a discount for having one or the other and purchasing the one you don't have. Thanks for listening.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I bought this game for my son and at first he enjoyed moving the fish around but quickly lost interest.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's only $35 and it works on my Android phone & tablet, it even works on my iPhone 4 as well! I just need to cast a YouTube video clip onto my &#34;dumb&#34; TV (which was bought about 5 years ago), then I can do other things on my iPhone. Amazing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game because your learning about nature and hourses.  If you love hourses like I do you see yourself as a whole different pearson .If I were to get a horse her name would be brownie. Sweet sweet brownie
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I listen to this cd as often as I can and anything that Jason Mraz does because he is so talented and I have been blown away by what he does for others...he is amazing!  I could never say enough about him, but every time I hear his voice a smile comes across my face and I want to get up and DANCE!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging and at times, frustrating. But, that's the beauty of the game!<br />Can't wait for the new levels coming soon!
1401938906|5.0|This book is not only exciting to read it will keep a person laughing out loud!!!  What an amazing writer.  I love the experiments and the just down to earth writing.....great book!
140006922X|5.0|what a bringing together of all the historical contexts, real and imagined, of Jesus' life The two versions of christianty, one real and the other made up by the Paul and his followers, are stunning.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game. Fast paced and fair. Starts off real easy and builds with each level. Can't wait to see some of the more advanced levels. Get it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|An insightful and fantastic book. A must read for any successful relationship. Opens and clears the lines of communication and allows understanding.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan provides a well researched, balanced, and overall fair, exploration and explanation of the historical backdrop in which Jesus lived. If you go into this book as a die hard Christian looking for an affirmation of your belief structure you might want to stay away; this is a fun to read history book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Just finished reading 'The 100-Year-Old Man...' and it was pretty good. A lot happened to Allan Karlsson in his 100+ years and it was hilarious. It took me a while to read this book but it was worth the time. The author goes back and forth between present-day and all the history of Mr Karlssons' life before his escape from a nursing home, but it's very easy to follow. Worth a read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|only got to floor ten before it makes me rate it to go on... lets see if this works. some floors have been challengeing.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved the 1980s references, the beginning of gaming equipment and the progression of the story.  The book held my attention from the beginning.  My son loves to play video games and I'm encouraging him to get this book to read.  Very glad I read this book.  As I read it I would make written predictions, then as I read through I checked off what was correct.  It's a shame when corporate greed wants to interfere with the average man, but will they get theirs in the end?? Surely hope so.  I highly recommend this book.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's unique experience and eye-witness account provides additional assurance of what awaits each of us after this earthly life. If you are concerned about where you spend eternity you must read this book.
B00DNO2LFC|1.0|i disagree that the husband is either cold or callous....  its pretty clear he wants to be a family and be with her, but doesnt know how to deal with her muteness and she gives him the cold shoulder at ever turn, only \\"speaking\\" to him in regards to her piano. He is very patient with her till the end when he breaks in anger. He does not understand how deeply her love is for her piano, only that he read she played the piano. The neighbor did and took advantage of the situation.  They did not share a love. They shared the enjoyment of each others bodies.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very easy to learn and it is quite fun! It is easy to keep playing even without in game purchases.
0345472322|5.0|Dweck's Mindset gives teachers food for thought.  The way a teacher interacts with students is crucial to the idea of moving students from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset, and helping students maximize their potential as learners!
B009LDD54K|5.0|We finished watching it in a couple of nights.  We were sorry that we finished it.  It leaves you wanting more, and, now, I want to watch Season 4!  I care more about the characters, this season!  The person who plays the mother of Jimmy was excellent, and I really liked what they did with her.  We, actually, gasped out loud, a few times.  I LOVE the character of the ex-government employee who used to confiscate alcohol, and what they have done with him!  Just LOVE that!  We really look forward to seeing the 4th season.  I hope there is one, because there is definitely all kinds of room for these characters to grow.  I want to find out what happens to them!  This season was super high quality and very entertaining.  I liked it a lot more than the second season, which kind of lost my attention.  My attention is way back!
B004XE0P5E|4.0|Liked his first album, For Emma, Forever Ago, better - would rec. getting that one first. But this is still a good solid Bon Iver album, thats distinctive, emotionally evocative yet also easy listening chill music.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great read very detailed loved it! The writer did a great job of telling the story of Pi! Definitely worth reading!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Get this album, For Emma, Forever Ago, first before getting his newer album. Its airy, chill, original and felt music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great read and I was excited the whole time. It will definitely be read again because of how great it was
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great but highly addictive I like how you get 17 daily coins for free for just being a user
0385340540|5.0|This book will keep you guessing, I learned a lot from it.  Not one that I normally would have chosen but one picked by a senior book club.  I am glad I read it.  I did want more of an ending but my imagination is good.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Same premise as the classic game, but with better graphics...not off the chart great, but still pretty good. I definitely reccomend it as a time killer.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Considering the topic of this story, this was a wonderful book. I would have read it quicker than two evenings but didn't want it to end to soon. I will say I am pretty emotional - meaning I cry at Kleenex commercials but with this book I didn't know if I could finish it because I was crying so much. But don't stop that from you reading this. Really, really good.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|Movie was very entertaining and Mel Gibson is a favorite..... I am very satisfied with purchase. Looking forward to my next purchase.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I thought this was going to be a fast paced science fiction movie.  Instead, it felt more like a silent documentary.  The entire premise could have been edited to 20 minutes and been a nice twilight zone episode.  If you are having trouble making up your mind just wait and rent it for $3.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|It's a cute gazme to play when you're bored. Pretty colors and great graphics. Only down side is you have to buy more bubbles.....
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought the movie was great, but still nothing compared to the book. Mr. Martel is an artist with words.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|i bought this album..i only like 2 songs..the rest are just boring..when i listen to the album i tend to fall asleep..it is soo boring..this album is the worst album ever..in my opinion..im not loving adele..im not a hater,i just dont see what the big deal is about her..her voice isnt all that..matter fact i find her voice annoying..there are better artist out there with better voices..Like Leona Lewis etc..bottom line is that i dont like her music..her music is just boring
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I honestly didn't like this one as much as the first two.  The third was ok.  This one was just ok too.  I expected more from it, being that it is supposed to be the last one.  Just not as scary.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|A lot of interesting points made, perhaps many of them specific to how introverts are perceived in the US, but still pertinent in this age of information overflow and celebrities vs content.  Worth reading.<br />There is one chapter where the writer offered practical and actionable advice on how to interact better with people of the other type (introvert to extrovert, and vice versa) when you are angry or need to make a point.  I found this helpful and occasionally refer back to it.
B009AY04A8|3.0|The game is ok but i wish there was more to this app. Like mystery abby that game is the best
0385523912|5.0|Insight into how restrictive the North Korean regime is.  Severe punishments are dealt out for minor infractions.  Human lives are not valued.  People are encouraged to &#34;snitch&#34; on each other and it is done regularly. Reminds me of Nazi Germany during WWII with the concentration like &#34;camps.&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game with different changes throughout the game and takes time to get through challenges. Highly suggest it to all to down load and have fun.
0143122916|5.0|The book is written about an individual who was born in Camp 14 in North Korea.  His lack of ability to feel or understand emotion lead him to &#34;snitch&#34; on his mother and brother who were planning an escape.  This resulted in their deaths.  The book details may other horrors during his stay in the camp.  Excellent read.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Reminds me of Patrick Rothfuss. I read it in about two days which is quick since it takes me around two weeks to finish one.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|really a very good movie - was afraid it'd be an 'expendables-type' movie, but was not a throw away, it's worthwhile and a lot of fun!
B005CWRB44|3.0|I don't feel that this light is worth $27 when you can get a MagLite for under $20.  Realistically you will not use this light for every day carry.  It is way too small, and the twist on operation just does not lend itself to quick light when you need it most.  This light (for me) is relegated to staying in the car for emergencies.  A task that you could accomplish just as well with a cheaper MagLite.<br /><br />The light itself seems to be of quality build, and I have another Fenix light which I have been happy with so I definitely have nothing against the company.  Just make sure you know why you are buying this light, and don't expect it to do things that it cannot do.  I should have done a little bit more research before buying, which is my fault.  But I would not waste your money on this light unless it fits specifically into your plans.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|loved this when i saw in theatre.......so glad to see it again, DDLewis is a fantastic actor and only works in films he feels<br />worthwhile - that should tell you something!
B00969PR18|5.0|This is excellent! I have to drive different places for my job and this is so much easier than having a bunch of paper maps.  I can put several destinations a head of time and I always get to where I need to go.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This is a great and fun game for memory and strategy....it keeps you coming back for more! If you are a fan of Alice in Wonderland, please give this game a try, you will be glad that  you did
B00ATP24NW|5.0|I heard Radioactive for the first time on the radio. I didn't really like it at first, but then I grew to love it. I listened to all the songs on a website and found that It's Time was by Imagine Dragons and I already loved that song. I bought this CD and got every song on my Amazon Cloud. BONUS!! I have to say that Bleeding Out is my favorite of all the songs. Check it out.
B003XYE7R2|2.0|It was kind of boring at some parts. And the rest was good. I liked the end the most. Yeah
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|Philippe Gregory is my favourite author. I find her books compelling and extremely well read. All her books keep you wanting more, and make the, hard to put down! Looking forward to the next book!!
B0061S073A|4.0|This is an easy install.<br />I needed a place for my grand kids to go for fun, without hunting for their favorite app.<br />This has worked out perfect.<br />The one thing that could be added is the ability for each kid to have his own apps separate under his own name.
B0090SI4LU|1.0|The DVD did not work so I was unable to watch it, It was very disappointing as I was looking forward to see ing the movie.
B00A92MDH2|5.0|This is a great album.  It has a large variety of music from the 70's.  If you already own Shiek Yerbouti, Zappa in New York and Orchestral Favorites you may be familiar with some of the songs already.  I didn't have Orchestral Favorites so I'm glad I added this to my collection.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|If there was a higher rating available for the truly GREAT movies, Red deserves it!!!! This movie has it all!!!! I can't imagine anyone not liking it!!! I saw some bad reviews, which honestly shocked me, so I read some of them.  Most people are not reviewing the MOVIE itself, they are reviewing the DVD quality, the delivery format and speed....Errrr.  THAT is not rating the MOVIE!!! Take those complaints elsewhere!! This has to be in my top 5 movies of all time....quite possibly number 1.  If you have a sense of humor, a sense of romance, a love for excitement and danger....and IF you are NOT one of THOSE people who critique every single moment, just looking for a flaw, ANY flaw(you KNOW the type); if you just enjoy the movie for what it IS and for what it was MEANT TO BE....you, too, will become a Red fan!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|An excellent summer read with a real life lesson regarding the many dimensions of our life.  I certainly identified with some of the characteristics of these interesting women.  's Moriarty has a way with characters and story.  I read it cover to cover in one binge read!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|One of the best books about Jesus I have read in a long time. Great references and dialog from other will known rel. historians.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My Nephew loves this toy. He can't walk with it yet, but loves playing with it while it's clasped down
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Had terrible reviews but I absolutely loved this movie. Full of great one liners and unforgettable scenes that only the comedy duo of Franco and McBride could produce. Great buy!
B00A429YF6|5.0|It was in Good condition and timely. got to give it to my friend she loved it. I would do it again!!
B00AZR10HK|5.0|Our daughter loves LEGO Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased the \\"Olivia's Tree House\\" Set for her for Christmas and it was a big hit. Since then, we have purchased several additional sets for her collection.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Emma's Sports Car Play Set comes with 159 pieces. It includes the Emma character and her pet cat. It also includes a sleek sports car with curved lines and a curved windshield. It has quite a bit of detail with the front grille, bigger tires, side mirrors and a fancy hood. It has several additional features to complete your outing with street signs, a standing city map display and a picnic bench to eat your included lunch. It also has additional accessories like a bag, a music player and a camera. It is a really nice little set with a lot of playability and is a great compliment to other Friends sets. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow and the recommended age is 5-12.<br /><br />One point of caution, the MSRP on the LEGO web site for this set is $14.99. If a set isn't Retired, you shouldn't have to pay much more than the MSRP. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target/LEGO and usually when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more so be careful if the seller isn't Amazon, especially around the holidays when Amazon sometimes sells out. Make sure to shop around.<br /><br />Long story short, this a fun vehicle set with plenty of accessories and unique city items that will be a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />Please Note, there is a non-import version available here: [[ASIN:B00CNBGUHQ LEGO Friends Emma's Sports Car]]
0345803493|5.0|BOOK 2 was FANTASTIC. I'm working on Book 3 now, and so far book 2 is by far THE BEST!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! It doesn't try to suck money from you through buying gold (currency in the game bought with real money) in fact, you can receive gold through friends! Friends don't have it? No prob. People always post their storm 8 ids (their username pretty much. It's what you need to add friends) on the walls of yours and other islands you can visit's walls (chatbox).<br />Something that someone might complain about, and that you probably will see or have seen on other reviews is the amount on time it takes. Im level 25 as of the writing of this review, and the most time i've gotten to wait for eggs to hatch, breeding, territory expansion, etc. is two days. Im sure there are longer to come. Im perfectly fine with this.<br />A) It's a lesson in patience<br />B)It gives you something to look forward to<br />One thing I do want to complain about is the lack of interaction with the dragons. It seems this game is simply about trying to finish th quests they give you so many at a time. If you tap on a dragon's profile, it give you an &quot;about this dragon&quot; kind of thing. It tells you how to take care of it, it's personality,  what it likes to do, etc. But you can't do those things! All you can do is feed it and level it up! And when you aren't feeding it? It just walks around the habitat and smiles at you. Yup.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's still a really fun game. I would recommend it to anyone.<br />Add me! Storm id: crazed girl :)
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I was merrily tippy-typing my way along, on my way to a sure best seller, *everybody* is buying Sherpa bios this year, when I made the mistake of italicizing a word... it took the command but as soon as I typed, it shifted from italics to underline.... AND IT WON'T FRACKING SWITCH BACK!!! I've closed the notebook, I've closed the program, nothing, whenever I try to type on that particular entry *boom* we're fracking UNDERLINING again.<br /><br />Solution... first praise Zorkta it was a &quot;free app of the day&quot;, had I actually paid the $3.99 or this shtako, I'd be downright pis*ed.<br /><br />As it is, can you say DELETE?<br /><br />I *knew* ya could. :-)
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well written.Thought provoking and informational at the same time. All the controversy in not warranted. I highly recommend this book for any free thinking Christian.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's almost too early to review this product since I only recently received it but what little I have used it amazes me, therefore, the five star.  There is also the fact that I am a beginner  so no previous experience, but wanted it primarily for reading.  Ask me later.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is a fantastically funny person. As others have mentioned, I too laughed out loud long and hard for most of the book. I enjoy her personality so reading this was a no brainer. Some seem to want to deny it, but they are fools; she is hilarious!
B002L4QP0M|2.0|This book was very disjointed in my opinion. There are better books to spend your time with. Characters lacked depth.
1567184855|5.0|It's a great book. it will certainly change your life if you think your body and the physical world is all there is..
B000007MVD|5.0|As a huge Beatles fan, I have become more and more interested in the &#34;early days&#34;. There are several good books out there to read and now hearing this gold mine of their early work is a adjunct to the books. Heavily influenced by Chuck Berry and other lesser known American artists (Arthur Alexandar - Anna......Soldier of Love), these discs represent what they were plowing through night after night in clubs, dance halls, and at the Cavern Club. For the casual Beatles fan? Probably not. For the serious hard-core fan? Absolutely!
0553378384|5.0|It's a great guide to Nodal astrology. If getting the skinny on anyone's chart is fundamental to effective astrological counseling, this is where to start.
1416972250|5.0|This series sucks you in and doesn't let go. Sometimes the third book can really start to lag in the story line, but I am happy to say that was not the case with this series. I was on the edge of my seat.
B00A285OOW|4.0|This was another great example of a book by Philippa Gregory, great storyline, and so interesting, albeit somewhat sad, to learn about Elizabeth of York.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Cuba ah it's ceded ft huff will check with such earth drug web Werth dc flag Shi Schenck watch sch sch sch chi xxx cm dc cm fan
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I didn't love it the first time I read it through, but I liked it more when I read it again. I can't wait for the next book!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love it. Just like when I was young but more fun.  Like the axditions of repairs and trees as shields
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I've read through these several times, and I always pull something else out of the book. Excellent reads, I highly recommend.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I liked the way the author mixed Greek mythology with modern day things I also liked Frank because of his gift.I think this book showed a lot of romance and it is a very amazing
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Interesting to see the world from the perspective of a Warwick daughter, but this might be one of my favorite PG books
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great movie on the history of that period.  And it has a happy ending too! A must see for music fans.
0345803485|1.0|Not only is this poorly written by a novice author who repeats adjectives..I could not get further then a  third of the way through this book for its stomach churning description of  deviant sexual practices. Waste of time.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I watched this movie as kid and I still love it today!  All children should be exposed to these types of movies because they are classics!
B00632HWOG|4.0|I Got the mail program for a message board that I subscribe to.  It serves the purpose well.  Gives me another address to check.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Ok, the expression that I couldn't put it down is often over used but not in this case.  Keep me going, loved the background story before the main story, not too much, just enough.  Loved the outcome, great read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was purchased for myself and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I love the story line and plan to read the whole trilogy! I certainly recommend it to those 16 and  above!
B008B9JTLI|3.0|This movie was okay but very slow in the beginning. Has a shocking ending if you can be patient enough to get to the good part. As always Sameul Jackson is great the start is slow but he keeps you watching.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|A good read but a little too graphic for me in places. Still couldn't put it down. Violence did make sense.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This the best movie of all times. If you do not see this movie you are missing out. Every time I watch it I laugh like it is the first time I have seen it. A classic and a must have!!  The acting is spectacular the story line is great and it never disappoints.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|This app is good enough for me but I can see why some people don't like it. I can type up whatever I want on word and that works great. I can even send it to my computer easy enough. The indentation and numbering gets screwed up a little but that's ok for me. I still haven't tried to figure out excel yet but it seems easy enough but PowerPoint isn't even shown on here. I can't find it anywhere. Also the pictures on here are inaccurate. Everything under the tab &quot;Function&quot; is actually an ad-on that you have to buy (up to $6 worth). It's good enough for what I need it for but if I wanted everything that it offers then I would be upset.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Love Love Love this Movie have watched it 5 times since I got it great from beginnning to end and very very funny!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have to admit I thought I would get bored really quick. Most games is endless looking for items. This game is different. There are collections, items you collect, it's different. It's different in an area with a lot of the same.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game I can play all day since are hard since easy but you can go to YouTube to know the answer
B005OP7162|5.0|Revenge reminds me of what goes around comes around. Funny, suspenseful and romantic. I can watch the show over and over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've read this multiple times and its better every time :)<br />I cannot wait to see the movie especially the third one also!
B005XLN97M|3.0|My five year old daughter got this for Christmas from Grandma. It's her first barbie house and she seems to enjoy it, but I plan on expanding it with a few other barbie houses when we get the chance. Or we will splurge on an extra large wooden house.<br /><br />The kitchen set on this one is very wobbly and the doors are a bit difficult to open and close with out tipping it over and out of the house.<br /><br />None the less, we have a nice time with it. It's ok for a first barbie house. Next time we'll go for more.
0887307280|5.0|This book is an easy read and very detail-oriented.  It was good to see that we did some things correct when starting up our small business.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The health potions system is stupid....everything else in this game, awesome!!! I haven't spent real money cause there is no need. They have great and upgrades you can get by earning coins in fights and its pretty fast and the fast you can buy with coins in game is as good if not better that the heart you can buy with real money...overall, must have game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Was a great game, still is a great game very fun, very addicting, keep these kind of games up. I would definitely recommend his game to anybody.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Funny, emotional, beautiful movie. Great acting. The subtitles capture the French very well. Even though it is very 'French' movie, it is very easy to relate to. My teenager sons saw it and loved it too, even though there were no special effects, no shootings, and no over the top drama. The characters stay with you for days. Must see !
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is perfect!! I enjoy so much having the convenience of using my phone when I have breaks at work or when waiting for appointments, etc. I do have a tiny problem with both devices being in sync for the correct page number, but in general-----I love it.
B00846TTDG|3.0|The acting is a little...not so good at times, but definitely worth a watch. Some cool actions sequences and seeing the SEALs in action is AWESOME.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is a great time killer love it helps put me to sleep also the bad part I running out of energy ......very addictive....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love, love this game especially since they seemed to have fixed the problem I had the first time I downloaded it. I hope they add more levels.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|One of the &#34;summer songs&#34; of 2013, it instantly transports you back to the late 70's with its smooth fusion of styles.<br />Daft Punk keeps the Euro-tronic sound alive, Nile Rogers' funky &#34;chic&#34; bass is immediately identifiable, and Pharrell Williams practically channels Michael Jackson's &#34;Off the Wall&#34; energy.<br />This is great for smaller, intimate gatherings and evening events.  Also, could be used as a mix-in for a disco/80's throwback party.  Has that vibe.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Put off reading the last book for over a year, lived it and would have loved to read more by Larsson....
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A wonderful movie. It bends time and space.  We meet historical figures and they come across as real people.<br /><br />What a concept. An author trying to get a manuscript into a good enough version to send it to a publisher. Skepticism among those close to him. . . . Somehow, Gil (the author who has been a screenwriter in his prior professional life) comes into contact--in the evening and in the past--with characters like Ernest Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Picasso, Dahli, and Gertrude Stein. He also runs into a woman who captures his interest--although he is scheduled to marry another woman.<br /><br />Stein works with him on his work; Gil also grows and becomes his own person.<br /><br />The time travel element should NOT work--but it does.<br /><br />A delightful movie!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|i thought it was very helpful and it was always at my finger tips when i needed it the most
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|People who play angry birds the original game is 100% free the update gives us reds mightey feathers the rest of surf and turf bad piggies for the free version greatest update ever:)
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This movie was wayyyyy better than I thought it would be. I was hesitant to see it at the theater when it came out because of all the hype. I enjoyed it.
1577314808|5.0|I heard many of the things that Eckhart Tolle says in this book. I know now that I didn't really understand them until I read this book.<br /><br />When a person speaks, writes, sings, or acts from their heart it's powerful. This whole book is written that way. If you're interested in spirituality, begin here.<br /><br />He writes about quieting the mind and listening to you're spirit. I've heard people write and speak about being here in the &#34;NOW&#34;. Eckhart Tolle tells you exactly how to do this.<br /><br />I also have &#34;Stillness Speaks&#34; book and I peeked into it. It's outstanding as well. &#34;The Power of Now&#34; was listed very highly on a list of books that have transformed peoples' lives, First or Second and &#34;Stillness Speaks: was also there at about Fifth place. These are books you will enjoy and will read over and over again. There are a lot of good books on Spirituality but Eckhart Tolle's books are better than 99% of them. Also they are inexpensive.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|There isn't anything that I dislike at all..I'm in my 70's and got a HD Kindle Fire for X-mas..ever since then I can not put it down...
1594746036|5.0|This book was a breath of fresh air. I wish I hadn't read it on Kindle because of all the photographs, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. I cannot wait for the next book!
B0063M22QO|3.0|I rated Mahjong ok because I can not see the tiles very well and there is not much color on them.
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the story. I have a soft spot for this genre, but I think it is the kind of book anyone could read and find interesting.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game has horrible controls and the only good part of it is it takes like 20 hits from a diamond sword to kill you.
B00005NGAK|5.0|I thought this video was full of fun and the dancing was out of this world. I would recommend this video to everyone.

B0088P2A7A|5.0|This is one app everyone should have. Easy to use and enjoy article of the day. I use this app from music to history to current events.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Dont usually care for McConayghey, but he was really very good and the two child actors were awesome.  Interesting storyline. Character developmnet instead of shooting and special effects.  Thorougly enjoyed this movie.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|It was number one on my list of things to get when preparing for her concert this past July. I had to make sure that I had her most recent album (this one--even though the songs weren't new) and had to memorize the words. This worked.
1592402038|3.0|As a history of the evolution of punctuation, and an explanation of usage this book is great.  Are you aware of why punctuation came about?  Find out here.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie is significantly better than any other Disney movie that has recently come out. I LOVE that she has two parents and that she doesn't need a man to be happy. It's about time Disney got a little modern!
B005GIS23I|5.0|You can't go wrong with this movie if you like to laugh. (If you're sensitive about your religious beliefs, however, you might want to skip this one as there are many jokes aimed at religion.)
B000YMM3CC|5.0|One of the greatest love stories of all time. I cry every single time I watch it. This copy was a gift for a friend who had NEVER SEEN IT. I couldn't believe it when she said that!
0446547654|5.0|The author is one of my favorites. He doesn't seem to disappoint you. I later gave this book to a family member who has been passing it on to her friends. All seem to agree on it being a good book.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Fantastically funny movie. I have watched it a few times and think for a teenage chick flick, it's really great!
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a cute hidden object game. There are a lot of different type puzzles for the mini-games.  Excellent graphics.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|I have never seen a more racist children's movie in my life. Not to mention the music pretty much sucked. Between this and Tangled, Disney is going downhill fast.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but not stressful. I'm looking forward to more rooms. The only thing I would like to be different is for the room you're on to save if you leave so you don't have to start the room over
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|This movie is hands down my favorite Disney classic. Something about Peter Pan sparks imagination in EVERYONE, regardless of age.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Such an amazing book, audio or otherwise. I could not stop listening! Many tears at the end! Wonderfully written! It is a must read!!!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Just what I though. Very Good. Stayed Awake. I look forward to seening the next come along action to vies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game just wish there were more floors. We couldn't put it down. Challenging but yet not too hard. Hopefully it won't be too long on more floors
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|I did not stay awake. Fell a sleep. This movie was not what I thoutht it would be. Just was not the type I was looking for.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I really like the variety of games available with the app.  I am disappointed though that it is on my Kindle Fire HD 7 upside down.  I have tried everything I could think of to fix it but I can't use my stand to play it horizontally.  This is frustrating.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|After 3 hours of trying to connect to my WiFi I called Google for support. They said I may have received a bad device and would escalate my support call to hardware...never heard back from them, it's been weeks!
1401942601|5.0|The cards are beautiful, but they are difficult to separate due to the gold edging. So twist the cards to separate. Do Not pick at them, it will tear up the edges on these beautiful cards.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie that has something for everyone to take away from!  Watch it with the family or friends!<br />Fun for everyone!
0307593525|5.0|Do Not Read This Book While Hungry. Your mouth will start watering, & even drool some. I know I did. There are so many helpful basics in this book. I would recommend this to everyone. Especially helpful to beginner cooks.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a very nice movie for the whole family.  The pace is steady,doesn't lag or drag. Lots of nice action parts with kids an bad guys.  Would recommend this to everyone who likes nice fun movie...
B001QWBM62|4.0|Just got it haven't used it yet.  Why? It wouldn't recognize the SD card. I looked carefully at the manual. Not a word about putting in the card. I reinserted the card 20 times, re reread the manual.Turned the thing off and on 100 times.  Talked to another tech at Musicians Friend who said to send it back. I was making out the return forms to Amazon but I called Zoom and the man said I'd have to return it.  But then in asking about the card size he said at one time Zoom was shipping the SD card along with another much smaller card which you insert into the big card. Kind of like Mini Me.  Well damn I said I wondered what that little card was for. Problem solved he replied. Working fine now. Yeah after three days of screwing around and frustration. A failure to communicate I call it.  God almighty Jose (Wales)!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35, you can't beat this streaming HDMI dongle.  I'm able to plug mine into my A/V receiver and it still turns the unit on and switches to the correct input when activated.  The apps are limited, for the moment there's only: Netflix, Youtube, Google Play & Google Music.  But the potential is sky high.  Future apps have already been announced, such as Pandora and Revision3.  I'm almost positive that more content providers will be on board with this product by the time the holidays roll around.  This is a fantastic gift for anyone.  But get one for yourself!
B002N1AEMS|5.0|Been a fan for years and while they throw the sickest live shows, their albums are equally chilling. Romy... dat ass. I love that girl. The combination of her and Oliver and Jamie are magical and I hope they never stop. Best new band out there. Vinyl sounds great and I love that this came with the code for downloads... even though I already had a digital copy (gave the code to a co-worker to check 'em out... spread the love). Won't regret it.
0920668372|5.0|My mother read this to me when I was small, and now I am buying it for my sister and my little niece.  It's timeless.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|If you like to laugh and you don't mind fantasy/adventure stories, this is it. Danny McBride is high-larious. Natalie Portman is hot. and James Franco is actually funny in this one. There are really great dramatic, cerebral, Oscar movies--THAT YOU CAN ONLY WATCH ONCE OR RISK SLITTING YOUR WRISTS. This is funny and lighthearted and YOU CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER because there's always a joke you miss or a look or a gesture that will have you rolling. I loved it because I like to laugh and I don't take anything too seriously. If you're the same, get this. It's awesome.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is deffinately a psychological thriller / horor movie. Not too much blood (keeps it different from most horror shows, though I like blood), and nicely done how the show presents each character as you go. I love horror most, but I do love when I have to think. Great show, only on episode 4 and not bored with it yet.
B001DPC4SM|5.0|You'd never guess this thing was recorded live because it is on point. I love Prince and he'll always be this guy, not the weird symbol, not the weird Jehovah's Witness that he is now. This is the only Prince.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|Amazon product search was for &#34;Motherboard with CPU Processor Combo.&#34;  This item was listed in search results.  Product description read as if motherboard came with processor.  Product arrived-motherboard, no processor.  Now CPU needs to be ordered with another waiting period before computer can be assembled.
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|I was only mildly curious. The movie gives behind the scenes info an how a theatrical number comes together.  I don't think that she has lasting power, so I hope that she invests her money wisely.  I would recommend the movie for others who share my curiosity.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This is was really a great movie. It was so cute. I hope they really come out with more movies
0399162097|3.0|It's me; not the book. :) Not finding that one book that grabs me lately. Not since 'The Light Between Oceans'.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The game was fun enough but I'm not sure if was worth 5$.  I've played similar HO games for less.  Other than a glitch with the flower and tweezers the game was pretty good.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|i loved this movie because of the amazing twist for the movie but they drop the f-bomb way too much.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|As a writer and a fine art painter, I had been doing some of the ten step program intuitively.  Articulating makes them so much more real.  The revolution of new steps makes me so much more in awe of what I can accomplish.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was a great story - had a good plot, character building, appropriate amount of description, etc.  I highly recommend!
B003PIS6GO|3.0|When viewing the upcoming release of &#34;Ender's Game&#34; (2013) I was reminded of two classics which this movie seems to be an amalgamation:  &#34;The Last Starfighter&#34; and &#34;War Games.&#34;  &#34;The Last Starfighter&#34; is was it is; a low budget 80's flick with with all-in-all pretty bad graphics and acting.  For some reason it works for me even after revisiting it nearly 30 years later.  Definitely a rental and not a purchase.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is for anyone that enjoys 80's pop-culture, science fiction books, or simply just a book that reads really well.  The story was beautifully constructed - not too predictable, but not too chaotic.  The character building was of a real high quality.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone - in fact I push people to read it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|The movie was pretty good. The actors were all great and believable. Wish I would have read the book first.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have an Xbox which I normally use for HDMI movies.  I, personally, believe the Chromecast output is cleaner and it is usually easier to load up with my phone.  Although in some places in my house the wifi is spotty, it seems to get a decent reception in places where other devices do not pick up.<br /><br />My Chromecast does not get detected by my phone unless the TV is on and the right input is selected, which is contrary to the Google reveal video.  Hopefully this gets resolved soon, but I had ordered two and am still eagerly awaiting the second unit.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Great acting, very believable that this is their own story. I am so happy to have purchased this dvd and learned of this young man.
B00B97SNJI|1.0|Cd came scratched and was skipping will not buy again was disappointed but I guess it happens.  I was not happy bout it
B002ZFQD0E|3.0|This was being offered for 3.99 and I thought I like this artist, let's try it. Nice mix of eclectic sounds a bit on the techno side but pretty decent.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Curiosity in the popularity of this book was my main driving force for reading this book. So, let's call it what it is - it's smut. It's Skinamax on a Saturday night. It's basically a bunch of sex scenes woven into a story. However because it's smut it's a page turner.<br /><br />The main character, Christian Grey, is intriguing but when it comes down to it, he's what every woman wants - a project. Someone who has their own good qualities - he's rich and incredibly handsome - but who has dark brooding issues - mostly that he's had a scarred childhood and found respite in BDSM.<br /><br />From the female point of view, the sex is hot. But from a feminist point of view, this is just another in a rash of books that places a bright, intelligent woman at the domineering hands of a man that would claim them as property. And why does this bright, intelligent woman stay? Because the sex is hot. *disappointed sigh*<br /><br />I'm starting the second book in this trilogy as I've been told more is revealed as to why Christian is the way he is. Hoping for more character development and a little less multiple orgasms.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This has the story line of every other action spy movie. I love Bruce Willis and Helen Miren so that was the purchasing point for me. Nice light storyline. I enjoyed it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Fifty Shades Darker and wow. I've read erotica before but this is another level. So much sex I wonder how they didn't work in a urinary track infection!<br /><br />Cons: Repetition of phrases and concepts. This poor author is in desperate need of an honest editor that can give her some alternate phrases. My major problem with these books is the suffocating, interdependency of the main characters relationship. I sort of forgave it because one's damaged and one's inexperienced, but any person who survived a devastating relationship and became stronger for it, would have left this relationship in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Pros: I did enjoy the embodiment of the main character's subconscious and inner goddess. Those bits were nothing short of hysterical and effectively conveyed emotions that would have seemed trite if it were just explained.<br /><br />Loved the authors varied vocabulary... I now know what avuncular means. I enjoyed this second book more than the first because of the character development and revelations. None the less, the sex was gratuitous and it was a page turner.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I am a zombie movie fanatic and this movie was really different. I liked the love story that was involved.<br />Boy meets girl....boy eats girls boyfriend...... Boy protects girl......father not liking it.....  Yup it has all the hallmarks of teen drama only with ZOMBIES!!!!!!!
B00514HDNW|4.0|I have a passion for punishing myself by reading the books that inspired movies. The movies sometimes augment the books, assuming that the details you need you've already read from the print versions. Harry Potter was very much this experience. In some cases, I've enjoyed the books much more than the movie adaptations...Jurassic Park was one such movie. As beautiful as the film was, the book was leaps and bounds better.<br /><br />With this book, it's been a few years since I've watched the movie. I remember feeling bad about the dog... the loss of Neville's family, the search for a cure... the mindless zombie like creatures. In many ways, the movie adaptation and this source material are two fine stories that share common threads but diverge enough that they really shouldn't be compared.<br /><br />And that's how I had to approach this book. It took me about three chapters of saying, \\"Wow, that's really different from the movie,\\" before I had to have a mental \\"come to Jesus\\" with myself and say DON'T COMPARE THE TWO VERSIONS. Once I did that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was able to delve into the dark places and moral/ethical questions that came along with creatures overrunning the human race. Neville is flawed. He's tortured. He's a survivor. In essence, he's HUMAN. It's easy to empathize with his confusion, melancholy, anger and despair - even when some of those acts are unspeakable.<br /><br />Neville's journey is really that of watching the K&uuml;bler-Ross model, or the five stages of grief, play out its course (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance). And I never understood the significance of the title of the movie, the book brought the point home with alacrity and wonder.<br /><br />Totally unexpected, but a really great read.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie was really good. I really enjoyed watching it and I can't wait for it to go up for rent.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />The first book I read by author John Scalzi was The God Machine. I loved it so much, I went looking for the next of his novels to read. I didn't do enough research and started out with Sagan's Diary which, I later found out, was an offshoot this this novel. I continued reading it anyway and was fascinated by this person, Jane Sagan, from this military world that I didn't fully understand. It was a beautiful, intimate look at the life of a unique character and I wanted to learn more about the world she came from. Thus... I read this book, Old Man's War.<br /><br />This novel actually follows the experience of John Perry, a 75 year old man from Earth who joins the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF) with the hopes of regaining some youth for the exchange of military service to Earth colonies dispersed throughout the galaxy.<br /><br />However Perry quickly realizes that not everything is as it seems. I love the humanity of John Perry and how easy it is to connect to his experiences. His playful sense of humor reminded me of Ishmael Wang from Nathan Lowell's Solar Clipper series. Perry takes you through signing up for the CDF, basic training, standard combat situations, and culminates with his specialized service in the Ghost Brigades and meeting someone who strongly resembles his long dead wife. Enter Jane Sagan (*squee*).<br /><br />Even though I knew Jane Sagan would survive the dangers of this novel (because, you know, the whole reading books out of order thing), it didn't make this book any less enjoyable or any less exciting. When Jane is put in danger, I had heart palpitations until I reminded myself that, hey wait, .... she survives! WHEW.<br /><br />Themes of military control are strong throughout this novel - control of communication or lack thereof being the most prominent. There are multiple alien races each with interesting descriptions and political/cultural constructions. And all who are are warring with humans in one way or another. But the themes I loved the most revolved around family, love, and the meaning of relationships as they relate to each other.<br /><br />The characters are believable, easily connected with and decidedly human. There were Space Elevators, skipping of space ( that reminded me of folding space in Dune. I loved too that even though this is a science fiction book, sex is incorporated and presented as such a normal part of life. It's not gratuitous or overly romanticized - it just is.<br /><br />All around outstanding novel that is expansive enough to allow for many more adventures (which I can vouch for because, you know, the whole racing books out of order thing).
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book kept you captivated with the intrigue and true telling of relationships.  Love the setting and the wonderful soap operaisch story.  Very well written.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Great Quality AAAAA+++++ will be back. high recommended fast good communication great product. great package, great ship. fast. honest. friendly
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I understand the author is a man of science, but I believe he went overboard trying to explain that the physical possibilities of his afterlife experiences were not attributable to a logical, explainable, natural process.  It felt like he was twisting my arm to get me to believe his story and the miracle he experienced.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|I'm a sucker for animals. Sure, there are technical issues in regards to the models they used. For example, at the end one of the whales looks so bent over while \\"swimming\\" out San Francisco Bay you think it's fake (it is). That being said, I get teary eyed every single time the whales are released from the ship and start to communicate with the probe. This is my favorite Trek movie and encompasses the very best of Trek - a morality play with a positive message for the future.
B000V39KDO|2.0|Banal storyline, mediocre directing, mechanical acting. Tedious and tiresome. Perfect for sixteen year old boys, but adults shouldn't be bothered.
B00E1L9N8E|1.0|As usual, Hollywood makes the classic stars turn over in their graves with a new version of a great old classic. Forget Robert Redford or this chump. Watch<br />the real version with Alan Ladd!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have already recommended this book to 5 people who have purchased hard copies (mine was Kindle download) and are loving it!  Easy to read, accessible and results oriented.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|It never returns to where you were after clicking links or reading comments.  Have to scroll through everything again.  This is unacceptable.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I accidentally caught 10 minutes of this show on TV one night, was very intrigued, then looked it up here on Amazon.  I bought the first episode, thinking &#34;OK, if I don't like it, I don't need to buy the rest.&#34;  There is more intense emotion in the first 10 minutes of this series than there is in many full length feature films!  It sucked me in instantly and I find myself obsessing about the characters, their motivations, and the various  mysteries behind it all.  I've watched 3 episodes now, and am impatiently waiting for the next one to air. I liked David Tennant as Dr. Who, but was never as enchanted by him as an actor as many others.  His performance in this series though is simply over the top fantastic!  Watch it!  You won't regret it!
0763644765|5.0|Love this book! Very simple concept with easy to read pages and cute graphics! Highly recommend to other potty training grown ups!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think my brain is going to explode with how fantastic that book was. That's why it received one of my exceedingly rare 5-star ratings. I am not typically a gusher when I write a review, but be prepared for a gush. I don't remember the last time I read something so riveting. I found myself reading faster and faster, just dying to know what would happen next. In the positive reviews I write, I typically say things like \\"excellent character development\\" or \\"creative plot lines\\" but while reading this book I don't think those things passed through my mind because I was so absolutely absorbed in what I was reading. In retrospect, there was excellent character development and outstandingly creative plot lines (not to mention Howey's immaculately smooth writing), but the story just grabbed me like nothing else in recent memory and I felt like I was simply inhaling that book. I can't wait to read more by Hugh Howey.
B004YKSXYW|5.0|If history comes hard to anyone then this book will certainly ease that pain. Also serves as a great refresher!
B008COD5UI|5.0|Watch this film!!! If you are on the verge of a midlife crisis, watch this film and you will get back on track. This is video proof that being young is exhausting, amazing, dangerous, insane, gross, wrong, fun, and plain scary. Who would want to go back....after watching this great film. Kids, don't try this at home.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|Okay, first album was pop, he did what he needed to get himself out there and be able to do what he WANTED. So, he gave us some sweet blues that would make SRV proud. And now he offers up something that is just simple, easy listening music. This is a Mayer album that you don't have to sit and try to deconstruct his blues licks or get past the pop. It is a happy medium where you can just listen, relax, and enjoy. Waitin' on the Day is my favorite track, but there is something here for everybody.

Absolutely loved it !!!

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Gary Taubes goes deep into his research and reasoning. This is not his idea of why we get. Its a collection of information from  various sources around the world dating all the way back to the early 1800's. All the sources point to the same culprit ,so as it is stated in the book \\"this is not new information\\", however it is very foreign to the way most Americans think concerning weight loss.

B00D5YNQ5E|5.0|Of one of the most influential and creative bands of our time. Many of the songs on this collection of B-sides are better than some artists A material. Timeless yet captured the essence of alternative rock in the 90's

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book answered questions and added new ones. Intrigue and suspense it turns the intensity up a notch or two.  I thought the third book was my favorite but I am not sure now.  This one rivals it without question.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Boy, I must have read the wrong review before I saw this.  I went in expecting a Serious Movie, but instead, this is a rom-com hiding behind the scrims of depression, OCD, and bipolar disorder.  I guess pulling off mild comedy behind those topics displays a certain deftness, but it doesn't make this movie historically great, either.  De Niro is clearly here to raise financing for the film, which means he can mail in a variant of his increasingly-standarized post-Meet-the-Fockers persona.  The whole pro-football-as-obsession side story is as pathetic here as it is in real life (and I say that as an NFL fan!).  Still, on the plus side, the byplay between Cooper and Lawrence--the main reason for the film--is very well done, and there is no doubt that Lawrence is the Real Thing as an actress.
140006922X|4.0|Zealot is a good read and fill with historic perspectives on the life and times of Jesus.  I would recommend it.<br />Only shortcoming I could point to would be the need for some clear refereced sources in the text in many places.  The notes at the end are not marked in the text, making it difficult to create some context.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Whenever Cruise's name is attached to anything like this, I automatically assume that it's crap, but this one turns out to be worth a look.  No doubt that whatever quality exists in Oblivion is due to the fact that director Joseph Kosinski was permitted to direct his own graphic-novel source material, and thus stay true to the sci-fi heart of the story.  I feel that discussing much of the plot very quickly gets into spoiler territory.  The set-up: Earth has been attacked by aliens, but humans have won the battle--at the cost of the Earth's habitability.  Remaining humans are being offloaded from the planet to a giant space station, while a few &#34;techs&#34; (Cruise) hunt down the last aliens (savages or &#34;Savs&#34;).<br /><br />Special effects are more than acceptable for a current product.  The casting is successful:  Cruise doesn't repel;  Morgan Freeman is onscreen much, much less than his costar billing would tend to indicate.  Andrea Riseborough is notable as Cruise's &#34;tech&#34; assistant-lover.  And Olga Kurylenko has navigated the path from teenage model to talented movie actress suprisingly well; she's improved, bit-by-bit, in each movie she's appeared in recently.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I'm glad to see it is the start of a series.  I'm looking forward to the next one.
B0036UMM84|5.0|good movie with great music its worth the money and I just wish they would make more movies like this one
B008QTVNUI|2.0|This could have been an interesting movie, but is marred by the amount of graphic sex which was unnecessary to the story.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works great but it is very limited in app support.  This will become really useful when the native screen sharing from any app or even the base OS (Windows, Android) is automatically enabled..,
B008CP6RWU|5.0|A great collection of games to simply enjoy and show others. Only downside worth mentioning is you still have to download the games to your hard-drive through the disc. If you wanted to buy it on a disc to save you memory space your out of luck. It treats it like the original downloadable. For me this wasn't a problem but it is worth mentioning. You don't play the games off the disc. Whats  on this disc however is a lot of special bonus features, including documentaries and developer diaries, bonus art, themes, and much more. Worth the price for sure.

B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I find the game to be challenging and that's fun. Even better, the commentary is hilarious! I feel just like I'm in the middle of a game of golf with some wise cracking commentaries.
B00E25KVLW|5.0|I have programming background but it's still not easy to understand web programming structure.<br />What pros of this book is, it  begins with admitting 'Rails is not easy' and does not try to build useless shopping site like other Rails book. The book covers enough range of Rails and easily explains, some may feel lack of its depth tho.<br /><br />If you decide to learn Rails and you bough some other Rails book, keep them on your shelf and try this first.

B009AY04A8|3.0|I think that for the most part.. Nevosoft hidden object games are among the best.  Unlike some of these  kinds of games,  Nevosoft games have objects that actually fit the context,  rather than nonsensical objects, which I appreciate. .  That said, this game was too repetitive.  And I agree with several of the other reviews complaining about way, way too much dialog..  A good editor was in order.  I also had trouble with more than one item matching the search criteria and being penalized time for trying to select the &quot;wrong&quot; matching item.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I really like the variety of functions and changes that I can do to my photos. This would include the numerous free frames and other items available. I wish it one additional thing and that is to be able to break lines within the text option to make my text be able to be more than one single line. Making numerous line is not feasible because the resizing makes it unrealistic. Otherwise, it is my favorite free photo program for my Kindle.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I liked the storyline.  Characters were interesting, dedicated and yet endearing.  It was hard to put it down;  wanted to find out what happens each time he returns to the past.  Am glad he was able to have a life too.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I'll admit I was a little surprised that \\"The King's Speech\\" won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2010. It's certainly not that it's a bad film by any means, but it seems to be quite unlike what the Academy usually favours. It's not dark or gritty, it isn't concerned with hefty themes involving human rights or social justice issues, and it's all about the English monarchy.<br /><br />In essence, it's just one man's struggle to overcome a speech impediment - a man who happens to be the King of England.<br /><br />Based on true events (obviously) the film chronicles the years leading up to WWII in which Prince Albert of York became King George VI after his brother's decision to abdicate the throne so that he might marry American Wallis Simpson. This would be strain enough on any man, but Albert has suffered from a bad stammer since he was a child, making it virtually impossible for him to handle the latest broadcasting technology that requires him to make speeches to the populace.<br /><br />His wife Elizabeth (who we now know best as the Queen Mother) seeks out the assistance of Australian elocutionist Lionel Logue, the latest in a long line of doctors that have been hired to help the prince with his condition.<br /><br />At first Albert is doubtful, particularly with Lionel's unorthodox methods which involve him insisting on equality and addressing the prince by the nickname \\"Bertie\\". But there is a definite improvement as the result of the tongue-twisters, shouting, swearing, singing and movement exercises, and despite several setbacks and arguments, a friendship between the two men solidifies as Albert finally begins to master his speech.<br /><br />As you might expect, it's full of familiar British faces: Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helen Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Guy Pierce, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi, Anthony Andrews, and even Jennifer Ehle . All of the actors involved effortlessly bring their A-game, and Colin Firth in particular well-deserved his Oscar, managing a heart-breaking scene in which he sings of his unhappy childhood without any anger or self-pity; just quiet sadness.<br /><br />Likewise, it's great to see Helen Bonham Carter get away from Tim Burton's eccentricities and play a serious role, and Elizabeth (along with Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, the future queen and her sister) provides a ray of light in what is otherwise a completely stunted and dysfunctional extended family. It's a moving portrayal of a loving marriage, one that's complimented by the warmth of the Logue family.<br /><br />I will say that the pacing is quite slow and that visually it's rather drab. This surprised me, as these types of period films are usually lavish when it comes to costume and scenery porn, but here everything is dismal and grey. Most of the film is set indoors, but even the landscapes are shrouded in mist to conceal any glimpse of a wide open space. I've no doubt that this was a deliberate attempt to capture the stifling atmosphere of Albert's life, so be warned that almost everything is designed and shot to convey a claustrophobic, uncomfortable atmosphere. The exception is Lionel's consultation room, a large and lofty area with windowed ceilings and several layers of mottled, peeling wallpaper that serves as a fascinating backdrop for the actors. It's a beautiful space, and a suitable setting for the majority of the drama.<br /><br />I knew that there were some discrepancies in regard to historical accuracy, but after a quick look at the film's Wikipedia page I came to the conclusion that they're rather superficial and understandable given the medium of film. The timespan of the events is squeezed down and some of Lionel's methods are dubious, but for the most part dramatic licence is kept under control and used to make legitimate dramatic points. It's one of those films in which historians will get a little pernickety, but no one else will really care.<br /><br />Of most interest to me was the fact that Edward and Wallis were rather unsympathetically portrayed, the former as a bullying playboy, the latter as a self-absorbed socialite. This made for an intriguing flip on perspective so soon after watching Madonna's [[ASIN:B007Z9QWVK W.E.]] in which the couple were the protagonists. More than anything, the films illuminate the divide that exists not between hero and villain, but love and duty, and how each royal brother was affected by both over the course of their lifetimes. These days there is an emphasis on the superiority of romantic love over absolutely anything and everything else on earth, but watching \\"The King's Speech\\", you can't help but feel that Prince Albert, who put his duty to his country before his personal desire for solitude, was not only the better man, but better off.nd Wallis were rather unsympathetically portrayed, the former as a bullying playboy, the latter as a self-absorbed socialite.

B009AMALLM|1.0|Honestly, they definitely messed this one up big time, there was absolutely no major scary scenes....it was extremely slow. In the movie, they show you dates of incidents, and the first incident I believe it started from November 1st 2011, and I kid you not, some small jumpy parts started in incident November 9th 2011....your just sitting there questioning your self, when the hell am I going to fly off my seat?? because lets face it, we're all there to enjoy an actual horror movie right, the 1st one was scary as HELL, 2nd one was OKAY, 3rd was GREAT. It just bothers me how they don't keep the movie exciting enough for the Paranormal Activity fans, how would they like to have the people come back to watch the movie again? or be able to trust the director or writer of the movie? I was very VERY disappointed in this one, and if there is 5 its just going to get even more sillier and sillier and just come up with stupid ideas and story, not with this movie they won't be able to keep up! EPIC FAIL IN THE 4TH ONE. enough said.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|But, Holy Cow with a Capital He-Ck!!<br /><br />Laughing, crying, laughing… the story this guy wrote, lemme tell ya… I couldn't decide if I should put it down or pick it up again. I love the characters, really care about them like I haven't been able to since… maybe, since ever.<br /><br />I knew it couldn't end in a fairy tale, and I wanted to stop in so many places so I could just remember them as they are, their selves in a snapshot I could glance at in my mind from time to time and just wonder, without having to know.<br /><br />It has been over a week since I finished the book. Took me about a week to savor… stop and start reading. I invested small portions of time and was still so involved with them each time I sat down.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the author's other stories.

In the &#34;Under the Dome&#34; epilogue, he made a nasty comment about Sarah Palin which I could have done without, but at least it was in epilogue.  &#34;11/22/63&#34; is his paean to everything Democrat and civil rights related.  He seems to have forgotten that it was the Democrats who filibusters the Civil Rights Act.  Otherwise, it is a slow-moving mystery in which a time-traveler tries to prevent the assassination of JFK.  I had to put it down twice, read a short story to cleanse my palate, and come back to it.  That's how slow-moving it is.  Not one of King's better work, and I've read almost all of them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this book right after I saw the movie, it's surprisingly well written and deals with difficult social-political issues given that I was to believe it was written for the younger reader.  I wish I had read the first book before I saw the movie.
B0068THAGY|4.0|I watched this in Amazon Prime and if I had known how good it was, I would have paid money to see it in the theatre.  Although the ending wasn't favorite part, the movie as a whole is wonderful.  Between Spielberg and Abrams, you know you've got a good movie.  The acting talent from the kids in the movie is spot-on.  I seriously think all of these kids have a future in store for them. The storyline itself is something that unfolds quite well and it isn't predictable at all.  It's certainly worth watching whether you pay for it or not, and more than once.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I did enjoy the book very much, even though the subject matter was very depressing & disturbing.  I liked that it was told from death as the third party.  It is a book that our Book Club will be discussing at our next meeting.  I look forward to the discussion!
B001KT6JPA|4.0|I watched this on Prime, not remembering I had seen it years and years ago.  After about twenty minutes in, I could start recalling some scenes but I had forgotten the ending.  Overall, I think it is a great follow-up to Silence of the Lambs, which I remember seeing in the theatre when I was a teen.  Although I would have preferred Jodi Foster, Julianne Moore does a pretty good job (although she lost her accent before the end of the movie).<br /><br />As far as I can say, I would suggest seeing this movie even if you haven't seen the first in the series.  Standing on its own, it's a pretty good movie and I would definitely classify it as a Thriller, but not so much horror (I guess the blood makes it horror).<br /><br />Two thumbs up!
B005MLP8E0|3.0|Interesting, but not as good as the hype.  It moved a bit slowly.  Still, it was good to learn about the times.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Best comedy onTV in a long time!!! As a huge Friends fanatic, I am happy to see an actual funny comedy back on the air!!!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|In my house it's a fight to get the family to help cook, clean our plates, clean off the table, and get the trash thrown away... This game teaches young ones to do all those things- and it's FUN!! It also has a page where you can recycle. The free version is ok, but the $1-or so it costs is Well worth it!!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Does what it says. It is sturdy, fits firewire and thunderbolt perfectly.<br />Highly recommended!<br />I'm getting another one for my many firewire HDs.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|I have a 4 yr old that loves puzzles and he likes this one. The pieces slide into place when it's close to where it goes! I can see him playing this game for a year or more.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simply awesome dongle, we use it in the office for music, videos, conferences, ALL WIRELESS! :D It replaced HDMI Cable and increased our interaction betweet the team!
B009AY04A8|2.0|Everytime you pinch to zoom the screen or scroll it detects it as a missed click and plays an annoying sound. sure I can turn all the sounds off it but I wanted to try to play the game has it was designed to be played.  On level 1-2,  the box holding the silhouette of the items you need to find covers nearly a quarter of the screen can't be minimized.  With some UI refinements it may be a decent game.  As it is now,  I couldn't wait to Uninstall it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|hope to see more Apps for that, like NetFlix, YouTube...No issues, so far. Nice to have it for $35, period.
B00640UICA|5.0|Well designed and pleasing graphics.  I like how you can advance to the next \\"zone\\", which usually throws in a new character piece,  without totally finishing the previous. My only niggle is how the background music plays on a loop: I like the spooky crickets but the wolf howl at the same interval can be annoying.  I will be playing this one till I figure how to complete it.
B000002KAT|5.0|There's bluesy Van and funky Van and spiritual Van and story teller Van and all of them co exist in an intoxicating swirl that makes me ache as I listen. Madame George, Sweet Thing, I love Van Morrison, but this to me is the man at his thrilling heartbreaking best.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Items are a little hard to find sometimes but a good game. Glad conversations go by themselves. instead of waiting for you to touch screen.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I just bought two more...one for my hunting backpack and one for my tackle box.  These little, inexpensive tools are great for a quick pull-through on my field and fillet knives. I also keep one in the truck and one in the shop (like my reading glasses) so I will always have one at hand when needed.  I would recommend that Smith's offer them in hunter orange...they are small and easy to overlook in the field, especially in low-light conditions (like around a campfire), dressed in black.<br /><br />Just to be clear, I would not put my Japanese chef's knives anywhere near these tools, but for field and boat work, they are ideal.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Ok, I get the used one cause I want to try how good they are, and pretty much, it's better than my other wireless controller. I'm thinking about buying another one. Great product btw.

0805047905|5.0|I have a ten month old daughter who loves books but she easily destroys them. I was really glad to find this classic in a board book form so she can play without completely damaging it. Just a note: It is a small version of the book. About 4 inches by 6 inches.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It has been about 45 years since I last read Jack London. In the meantime I have read hundreds of books of all kinds. Returning to Jack London reminded me of why I became an avid reader. I read this book in one 12 hour shift and I felt lifted at the end of it. It is no wonder that Jack London is remembered over one hundred years later. His prose lives on the page as if it were written yesterday! The life of a dog, revealed in the most amazing, insightful and timeless way. This book was an inspiration to me as a teenager and a delight once again as an aging adult. I cannot recommend it enough.

B00B2YH7D6|5.0|My husband and I borrowed this from a friend, and liked it so much I bought it for us.  We both love music in general, especially 70's, 80's, and 90's pop/rock.  This is both informational (music history) and entertaining.  Dave Grohl is a great 'narrator' as well as one of the best musicians alive.

0812983459|4.0|This was an interseting story of how one man tried to save the life of a woman, a past friend. It was fascinating to follow his 600 mile journey on foot and all the helpful people he met along the way. The pilgramage acutally saved his life.

B005XQLBU4|3.0|Good time sponge.  Easy to play.  Nor bad for a free app if the day.  It is just like the old one I played ad a kid.
B0039208JE|5.0|Great movie, one of my favorites! Don't know why I waited so long to purchase this and would recommend it to anyone.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Delightfully whimsical in its circusy melodies, Panic! at the Disco's first album is unique enough to keep me coming back to it 8 years later. There's a lack of polish to it compared to future albums they produced, but I consider that an added charm. If you enjoy Fall Out Boy or the Hot Fuss album from The Killers, this one is worth a listen.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I am embarrassed that I bought this app.  It is not a real camera.  You have to hold your kindle over your shoulder and look sideways to see what you are filming.  How dumb.  Last weekend I used a friend's iPad to film our runs at an Agility trial and was very impressed at the ease of use.  AND you don't look stupid trying to record your video.  Wish I had purchased the iPad instead so I could really take pictures and videos without looking like a fool.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|different from mahjong that came with my computer. lets you change settings and is more challenging.  will also shuffle if you don't have anymore moves
B008RA3X5E|4.0|If you don't know what time it is, it's time to get this application. Those crazy Greeks invented time after time was found and the world adopted it so the least you can do is get this on your android.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is awesome if you have a facebook profile. I don't have one but I love it. 5his game does include wifi though. you create your own dragon park but beware, ifyou accidently delete your profile without a facebook you loose your whole park. one of the best games ever.
6305428050|4.0|The first film I saw featuring Elizabeth Shue, I fell in love with her right off the bat.  As a babysitter who has to bring her under-aged charges with her as she travels in the big, bad city to rescue an idiot friend.  Great film.

B000I9WW0E|5.0|Nothing is sacred. The entire movie dumps on all of our sacred cows one by one. Buy it. You will want to play it over and over.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Don't get me wrong it's a good game with a good story(very long). All Microsoft games seem to be plagued the same exact way. The story line is different but that is about it. They penalize you 20 seconds of your time to many wrong stops.  Biggest prob about that is the screen is so touch that it counts against even when u are just trying to adjust the screen. Their. Game is. Fun but I don't think out is fun enough to to play twice
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Good graphics, good game play, endless fun until you die. Good game over all. Controls are a bit twitchy but good overall.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|For anyone looking for a good take along game with strategic depth and entertainment value...this is it. The game is very playable. Interface is simple, very easy and fun to learn and offers hours of entertainment. The expansions are worth the money. I have both, and well worth an additional dollar. I do wish there was a little bit more in the way of visuals, but nothing much to complain about. Can't wait for more!
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|It's a shame that Sam Raimi felt the need to homage the 1939 celluloid tragedy that cast a near grown woman as a little girl and is so sugary, disgustingly dripping over-the-top that I have to side with the critics and audiences that originally made the film a flop.<br /><br />That said, there's some good stuff here, and a full-on non-musical new version of the actually book \\"Dorthy and the Wizard of Oz\\" would look promising.<br /><br />So first the bad: The film, especially the beginning, not only plays visual homage to the '39 film, but the dialogue as well. Stiff, stunted and unnatural sounding people like to blame Franco for his performance, but seriously, read his lines, mostly they're horrible. The real shocker though, and I didn't see this in 3D yet, is that for much of the early scenes in Oz it's so obvious they are on a green-screen it's not funny. It literally looks like they placed live actors in an animated film. Though scenes like the tornado and the final battle with the witch sisters are fantastic to look at, the simple shots of waking down the yellow-brick-road are jarringly bad.<br /><br />The good: It's always fun to see what lead up to events, even the horrid Star Wars prequels proved we had to see it, at least once. I don't care what anyone says, Franco does an excellent job and I think he was perfect. The relationships with the characters mostly worked, considering his co-stars where a bell-hop winged monkey and a broken porcelain girl, they where the best GGI in the film. Mostly the film was well paced, well acted and entertaining if a bit of a clumsy and pointless throw-back.<br /><br />The odd: Here is the synopsis, albeit scaled down, for both Army of Darkness and Oz The Great and Powerful: Trying to escape attack our hero, hapless and hopeless and a bit of a liar and show off is sucked into a spinning vortex and dropped into another world. There he is mistaken for, and accepts the role of, the one who will use his powers to save them, except he's a fraud. He falls in love with a local, but she is turned into an evil creature and joins the enemy. So he uses his knowledge of the modern world to win the battle with gizmos, tricks and machinery and at the end is redeemed and revered.t he's a fraud.

B004LQGXPA|5.0|Russell Crowe, Robert DeNiro and Daniel Day Lewis, eat your hearts out. George C. Scott's performance in this movie is the best by an actor. Ever. Period. End of story. It remains the standard for all time. He plays the famous World War II general, whose nickname was \\"Old Blood and Guts,\\" as a man without fear or even a shadow of doubt, but with an unmistakable human gleam in his eye. Patton was a flamboyant figure, but Scott's portrayal makes you feel as though you don't care what the real man was like - you could follow this guy anywhere. It's no love letter, however. Patton's flaws are clearly visible: his impatience, his penchant for drama, his tendency toward arrogance, and his deluded sense that he had been reincarnated many times. Winner of seven Oscars, including Best Picture, with Francis Ford Coppola's terrific script and Franklin Shaffner's brilliant direction, this is one of the landmarks in movie biographies. The battle sequences are enormous, using real planes, tanks and heavy guns - and this is decades before computer animation could supply such scope artificially. Shot in Spain and Morocco with a cast of thousands, Patton presents an immense tableau of men in war. This is literal; as in Lawrence of Arabia, women are almost completely absent from the story. The few female characters are marginal and only two of them even speak. Jerry Goldsmith contributed the glorious music fanfare, one of the greatest works for the movies, a rich thematic orchestration that reaches a thrilling crescendo in scenes leading up to the infamous Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and provides a satisfying coda at the fadeout. Patton is worth seeing on the biggest screen available - it is overwhelming in that format. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
030746363X|4.0|This is a life changing book!  If you can follow it's precepts religiously it works very well.  The rub is it requires a great<br />deal of disapline and commitment.  Even if a person only practices some of the habits suggested he/she will loose weight<br />and feel better.
B000I8G5GW|4.0|The first of five widescreen epics directed by David Lean, this tense World War II drama takes place in Burma - although it was shot on the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Alec Guinness, in an Oscar-winning performance, stars as Colonel Nicholson, the senior British officer in a Japanese prison camp, whose authority is challenged by the commander, played by the fine, veteran Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa. Detailed and authentic looking, the story is largely about the test of wills between the two enemy officers during the construction of a railroad bridge by the British prisoners. One of Lean's greatest movies, winning seven Oscars in all, including Best Picture, it features a nail-biting climax and strong supporting performances by William Holden and Jack Hawkins.

0345803485|3.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B00EPWDYRA Heartbreak for Dinner: It's Kind of a Long Story]], I can appreciate a romance that intends to be sexy and leave the reader wanting more. I read this at the request of my c-oworker, who swore this book was AMAZING. I think it honestly wouldn't be terrible if it wasn't for the constant repetition. I can understand why some people would like it. Some parts are definitely exciting but, is it realistic? As realistic as Hillary Clinton having a love affair with Prince Charles. It all depends on tastes, I guess.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|This was one of those movies where you needed to watch without stopping and starting. If you lost the flow you lost the movie. I l liked it though I can't explain why.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Ok, I will be honest I am NOT a cardio workout fan, in fact, I look for every opportunity to avoid it.  I have been going to the local high school and climbing stairs or doing fast pace walking about five times a week for several months, and I finally decided it was time to incorporate something more.  I bought this based on the great reviews and I am SO happy I did.  I am on day six now, and still working on Level 1.  The first day I couldn't finish the entire sets and had to take short breaks.. YES YOU WILL SWEAT.  My endurance has increased just in the first week, now I can complete all of level 1, even doing some of the full (not modified) versions of the sets.  I am going to start the next level tomorrow.  I am so excited to have found something that fits into my routine, does exactly what it is supposed to-- I feel better every day.  I would suggest this workout to anyone!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|My first zombie book. I love sci-fi but zombies just get boring after while. The fact that it jumped from place to place and situation to situation kept me reading until the end. Wouldn't read it twice. But zombie lover knock yourself out.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|Story is nice about survival and an unthinkable shipwreck mate. We skipped many boring chapters to finish the story.  Sad story but loved it as well.  Could have been a 5 star book if it was shorter with less boring details.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Very handy and produces very good looking notes that you can share with other apps etc.. would highly recommend, I like how you can import sms and contact details
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really loved this novel. It was well crafted and well plotted, if only all zombie novels could be so clear and versed in it's story lines and characters. To say that the movie didn't do this novel any justice is fairly obvious.<br /><br />The novel reads like a war report. You will receive documentary type tellings of World War Z (ie.: where they were, how they survived and closing thoughts). Max Brooks wrote the story with a clear understanding of how humanity would look before, during and after a plague outbreak that questions everything you ever understood about life, love and religion.<br /><br />If you're looking for a gore-fest, look elsewhere. I'm not saying there aren't moments of gore, but this novel does not rely on gore to sell it's believability.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Hope there is more to come.  Looking for the next set of &#34;Floors Escape.&#34;  Really enjoyed the first 10 puzzles
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|At $35, you get just about 1/3 the usefulness of its competitors. The exception is tabcasting; a good idea, but it's not there yet: video and audio don't sync up if you cast a page like Hulu, and for just regular browsing, you don't get to see the pointer.<br />However, casting Netflix from my phone was flawless and hi-res.<br />I feel it will get better with time and updates. It's not there yet, but it's a promising start (for $35).

B00CSJOO8K|5.0|Watched both seasons back to back in just a few sittings.  I think I've found my new favorite show!  I like the Nick and Jess storyline - it's nice to see a couple develop at a real pace, not at a pace dictated by writing concerns.  There's a lot of booze and sex, it's true, but what do 5 single people in their 30s generally like to do...?
B0057ZAA0S|5.0|Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an<br />eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly.  Not to mention a<br />bevy of superb, brave performances.<br /><br />This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of<br />Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"Boogie Nights\\".  Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional worlds (drugs, porn),<br />but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clich&eacute;s and makes us relate to these characters as<br />human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts.  These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality,<br />without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds<br /> around them.  You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them,<br /><br /> (spoiler ahead!)<br /><br />Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic.  Yes Renton is walking<br />away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about<br />money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs.  To me, that's what the whole, chillingly<br /> `choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about.  Truly `choosing life' is about a lot more than just<br />saying `no' to drugs.<br /><br />Not to mention the title `Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected<br />hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by.  Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning<br />away from living life just the same.

B0044DEAUA|2.0|This item worked for 3 months and then would not sync with my new phone.  Nothing is was wrong with the phone as it paired easily with other bluetooth devices.  I rechecked the specifications on this item and it did in deed support my new phone but for one reason or another it refused to pair with my new phone.  While the item worked it did so wonderfully.
159562015X|5.0|My daughter bought this book too and we both had two of the same strengths in our report that we got when we took our tests--- however, what those meant for each of us were very different due to the our other strengths.  It was really great to see it all laid out the way it is in the detailed report you receive when you do the on-line test.  I recently had a job interview and had no trouble at all with the dreaded &#34;what would you say is your greatest strength&#34; question that is ALWAY part of an interview.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game  could be a little more difficult.  Reminds me of my youth and hanging out at the arcade with friends
1616550414|5.0|This book deserves to be enshrined in pure gold and silver (it's better than you'd expect!). For the price you're paying for this book, you're getting 2 to 3 times the awesomeness!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|nice, why i have to write so many things i like and that's it, 19 words is for nuts. lol
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|It is well written and informative.  It has given me a new perspective regarding the gospels in the bible.  I will continue to read it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book. The author did a great job making every believable. I'm definitely getting the next one! Buy it now!
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|But not as good and Red 2 which was awesome! It will be nice to have of them in my collection.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|He enjoyed watching as he missed it in the theaters. If you like this genre, it's a good action movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This was a great film of a great stage production.  The next best thing to being in the front row!
B00CJGP116|4.0|This record is solid Marc Anthony, no surprises, but why fix it if it ain't broken? And his voice is pure silk and feeling, as always.
0143034901|3.0|The book arrived promptly, the condition was good in my opinion (not very good as advertised), but most disappointing of all is that the cover was different than the one I ordered.  I gave this transaction an okay rating because it is still a good book, in a good condition, just not what I was expecting.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I can charge my kindle and iPhone at the same time.  It really helps organize stuff in the car and charges my phone really quickly.
0345404475|3.0|This book seemed to center around the question of empathy - which humans, theoretically, have, and which androids do not. Bounty hunter Rick Deckard uses an empathy test to weed out androids, which are not supposed to be loose on Earth, from human beings, and then \\"retires\\" them from service. It's important to him, not because he's afraid of andys or has moral convictions about it one way or another (although there's one he'd like to boink), but because doing well at it affords him money/status.<br /><br />What bothered me about this is I didn't see/feel any human in it actually using or feeling empathy. There's this whole weird semi-religious thing where people tune into an \\"empathy box\\" to feel connected with other people who are viewing/experiencing an old man climbing a hill, Mercerism, but Rick doesn't have empathy for his wife. People in general, including Rick, don't have empathy for \\"chickenheads,\\" people whose mental capacities have been damaged by radioactive fallout. There's a striving for status in possessing one of the few remaining live animals, instead of a robotic imitation, but that seems to be more self-love than true caring about another living being.<br /><br />In a book about emotional connection with other beings, I didn't connect to any of the characters, and I had expected to. It's an interesting dystopia presented, however.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Understanding &#34;why&#34; made the &#34;how&#34; simple for me.<br />This book didn't prescribe any new fad diet but gave me the tools and understanding to decide for myself what was appropriate to eat, how much and when.  Essential reading for anyone interested in &#34;food as nutrition&#34; rather than &#34;food as entertainment&#34;.  As a 42 y/o Male this was the revolutionary step on my journey back to good health.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This action pack movie was filled with excitement, drama, and good acting. This DVD kept you on the edge of your seat.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone person that is considering purchasing this item.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|this case looks and feels good. the Orange is a great look and it protects the phone nice. cant beat the price for this case.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Denzel Washington is a very good actor and can play anything he wants.  He did a top notch job as a pilot.  This movie was exciting and could relate to issue going on today.  Also, makes you think how many pilot or professional operate under the influences.  I would recommend this movie to others.
B003UYUP58|5.0|As someone who has been involved in both treating cancer patients and in cancer drug development, Dr. Muherjee's book is accurate, wondrous in scope, amazingly well-written, and I believe informative and accessible to a very broad audience - a terrific read!!
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Since Episode #1 Season #1 every episode has gotten better than the previous episode. Each time I view it the tension and the drama build up. I have now seen every episode but one which is unavailable on Amazon. The best part is that over time you get to see how the characters develop and change. Also, nothing ever happens that couldn't actually happen in real life. It all makes sense and you never sit scratching your head over a seemingly stupid event. And I have to mention Amazon's delivery of this program is as flawless as any medium can be with a price that can't be beat.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love bingo and it is lots of fun playing on my kindle. It is also a lot cheaper than going to the bingo hall.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I won't repeat my reasons for appreciating this show. Please see my rating for Season #3. Thanks to Amazon for providing it so conveniently.
B000WQW988|5.0|A must own for any Nirvana fan they give a great intimate performance I really enjoyed seeing Kurt show of his singing talent and not screaming. Definitely one of their best shows and makes me sad to think what might have been RIP Kurt.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This one is good, great help if you get stuck. It is about a medium difficulty the map is super helpful. Great graphics, good story that follows well.
1573301183|5.0|A must own for any AIC fan they give a great intimate performance. Sad to see Layne clearly in the throws of his addiction and good to see Jerry act more professional and obviously worried about Lane early in the show.This was a gift for my husband and he loves it RIP Layne.
B001E9641K|5.0|Just spent a week with kids and grandkids and everyone wanted to play the nodic.  great addition because it is smaller that the others.  These games are sweet perfect for all ages old and young.
B00CRJSWBQ|1.0|I'm not to happy at all with this board. The first was DOA, code 76, and the second booted fine, found ram find but black screened on first driver install, code 8E. It also toasted a new Asus gtx760, so that's in for an RMA. Don't know if my three year old Raptor 10k hard drive also failing was coincidence but it's in the trash now. So I'll be on my third board and I don't trust the model at this point. Not to mention the time and money I'm out.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|This program has great graphics and features intuitive game play. Unfortunately, the mechanics of the program creates an endless supply of crashes and glitches which ultimately leads to frustration which is only resolved with the programs deletions. Do not invest time in this program. I have experienced similar<br /> problems with other programs offered by this company.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The gritty, exciting episodes kept me entertained from the beginning of the first episode until the end of the final episode. I'm lucky that I'm four series behind, so I have plenty left to watch. Ron Perlman does an exceptional job (as always), and all the other regular actors/actresses perform on par with him.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed the book and would recommend though some people will always be skeptic.  Delivery time was as promised and very satisfied with quality.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Heard of this finally saw it.  I like that I could see all at once and not wait till next week or week after to see what happens next.  Scenery, costumes are very authentic looking ..... Downside, alot of people to keep tract of ...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well l think this game is really good for kids ages 6-14 but you know everybody can play a game like this.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Wow .. nice to see all the episodes at once and not wait a whole week or two to see what happens next!
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|when i received it,just found a scar on the case,since it is just $10,unnecessary to return.<br />the CD is in excellent quality.
B005J7K950|5.0|This is a movie everyone should see. This and the silent version both. I am glad I was finally able to buy it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The boy child loves it. And it isn't hard laughing along with him seeing the silly minions in action. Happy times!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|While there is a bit of an issue with lag; overall, it's really a great product. Quick and simple to use and setup. The images are surprisingly clear as well.<br /><br />Am I happy? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a story. Even though there were blood and guts and death in this book, it was really a great book to read and I bet the others are even better.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|A more human perspective than any I have ever read on the inhumane conditions of North Korea. A must read.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Although it does not have too much meat to it, it is fun to play on a whim. The fact that one can upgrade missile performance as the levels get increasingly difficult is quite fun
B008M7JODC|4.0|Fringe is like the &#34;science&#34; version of X-FIles.  Entertaining, visually and mentally stimulating.  Can be a tad predictable, but overall good stuff.
B009AY04A8|1.0|It does not work on my kindle at all. It is upseting just because my little girl wants to play it
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game is really great. It has a good story line and the hidden object mini games are a blast. Definitely a fun time!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  It gives the reader pause for thought and your emotions are challenged.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A must read. I could not put the book down. I would highly recommend this to anyone who really desires a comprehensive understanding of the times Jesus lived in.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Love hidden object games. Game is a little slow on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1. I would prefer to have the choice to skip all the dialog if I want to.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Great product, exactly as expected.<br />I did not expect the item to arrive so fast.<br />Very happy, because I can take it on my trip to the Red Sea.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Monkey Boxing is a nice little game. But it it slightly easy and gets repetitive after a while. I would recommend this game to younger people.
B004WESFZW|5.0|I expected \\"Adjustment Bureau\\" to have mind-bendy twists to it, based on the ads, and it certainly lived up to that expectation.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was that it would also be quite the romance, with characters I actually cared about.  Combine that with some witty banter and you've got a heck of a winning combination.
1400064287|2.0|I found this book interesting but quite hard to read. It is very well written but it is lengthy with huge volumes of text. If it was easier to read I could like it. Don't think has added value to my knowledge
B0012GTZC0|5.0|An amazing reminder of the horrors and complexities of war - told from the standpoint of the British and the Germans.  Our younger generation has little idea of what occurred, and the amazing intricacies  involved on all sides - all without modern technology -were involved in this horrible event.  Ken Follett should be required reading in our high schools - from &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34;, to&#34;The Century Trilogy&#34;, each is an important learning tool.
0321811984|4.0|A useful book especially for beginners. It provides many examples and it extremely easy to rad and understand. Overall a good book on presentation design and structure
B00DW3GDQW|5.0|A superb film about the attack on Pearl harbor from the Japanese perspective along with the decisions that went wrong for the US that might have changed things that day.
1591396190|5.0|Great book, easy to read with plenty of examples. It has changed the way I view value innovation for ever ever.
B00C04H2VO|3.0|These are generally as advertised, although they do seem quite small - I haven't measured them but the reviewer who said they were 1.3-2\\" on average is probably right. Each character is connected to a plastic base, but they constantly came unattached so I super-glued all of them - problem solved. The detail is good, and if your kids want to pretend they are enacting scenes from their favorite movie, all the main characters are here. I paid $30 for mine but I see the price has gone up to $50. Honestly I think that is a huge rip-off as I thought even $30 was too much (although I paid it).
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is a very fun game and they have been updating this game for a while. A good way to burn a lot of time! And you can take in bite size chucks. Doesn't require a ton of time to play a few turns.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This product works even when the Kindle is sleeping.  Music to wake up by is so much better than a buzzer
0345529057|4.0|If you just want to read these books and enjoy Martin's incredibly interesting and complex fantasy world, you can't beat these books at about 5 bucks each. The construction is just fine, although it sometimes seems the binding seams would fail (but they haven't).<br />I read some reviews about missing pages; but I have checked and I haven't seen any such problem. I am only halfway through the second book so it may be something I discover later.<br />My only regret is that after I paid $23 for my set (a price I was extremely happy with), a week later the price went down below $20 and later went down even more. But no big deal- I went and bought my son his own set at the lower price!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Though I cried when Rue died this book this book made me very emotional and the character development is fudging awesome
B00B9B4IYI|1.0|Doesn't  work on zone 2. I think zone 2 is analog and this is digital. Don't really know the real answer! I'm capable but not professional! Perhaps more written list of compatible device's. My fault so I'll keep because I didn't research enough! My suggestion, ask questions of the seller and if they don't know the answer ask Yamaha. Just expect to wait a few days for answers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was tough for me for a while I cried of just the memory of this damn you John green sad depressing thoughts is what this book give you. You should read it
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The alarm clock is easy to use and quick to download. The only think I didn't like was that the alarm did not shut off automatically after a few minutes. Sometimes I wake up before the alarm clock and I am in another room so I like it when the alarm will turn it self off after a few minutes.
0345525558|5.0|This book was great! For a first time author ( I believe ) she has much talent! The book was captivating and the storyline was wonderful. I didn't want to put it down. I pulled for Victoria the entire book. Such a beautiful look into the face of hope.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I enjoy all movies with Robert DeNiro and Bradley Cooper. Excellent performance also Jennifer Lawrence also great performance. Overall this is a movie that I will enjoy for a long time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game great challenge. nice having a game that stimulates problem solving without making me frustrated. feels like being a spy.
0553801473|4.0|I am looking for some conclusions with this series. I would like to see some clear heros develop that are not killed off as soon as you become invested in them. After five books I don't think that is too much to ask. Aside from that I really like the series.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters are so charming, the estate is beautiful, and of course I love the drama! Can't wait for season 3 to unfold
B009R659L8|3.0|A good, fairly simple whodunit. The book flows nicely and keeps you wanting to know what comes next, not all that complicated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome I am addicted to this I play it all the time<br />You wont be to take your eyes off the screen<br />[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B004LP3AYI|4.0|This books begins right where the first installment of the series ended, and is as enthralling. I was afraid that what moved me most in the first book -- that is, the impossible love between Richard and Kahlan -- would prevent me from liking any follow up, but I was wrong: the author found a different way to make that love as impossible in the second book. However, just as in the first book, the end was a little bit too &#34;sugar candy&#34; for my taste... But hell, the travel to there makes for it.<br /><br />The only really big beef I have with this book is a technical one: I think it is the book with the most typos I've ever read; it is ridiculous. Was it ever revised? I wonder if the printed books are as bad as the Kindle edition I have read. Even though it changes nothing to the quality of the story, it could be quite distractng at times.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It is hard to wait for your friends to send back a picture to guess! Then it is your turn to draw something. I end up using the eraser a lot! Then send off my great drawing to see if they can guess mine.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a 500+ page book in less than 24 hours, but this one was THAT spellbinding.  Entertaining, completely believable, and well written, I can't wait to start SHIFT tonight.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Once I started , didn't want to stop.  An uneasy tenseness throughout book. A different storyline then we have been reading
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have not used it much, but it delivers! I t is nice to watch the movies on the TV vs the computer.<br />Very easy to install.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Totally awesome and fun for ALL ages; adults and children. If u like despicable me minion rush then I DEFINITELY recommend this game!! I love it. I just CAN'T believe it's free! :-D

B0063GORYU|5.0|I have tried several spider solitude games. This one plays the smoothest with the best graphics. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my android phone.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|In truth, at the time of writing this, I've only seen the first four episodes of the series, so I can't give a perfect review. I ordered the product used, and two of the discs did not read properly. That was my own fault and does not affect this review. (I'm currently in the process of returning and replacing the item.)<br /><br />From what I've seen, although it is true, the story is just a LITTLE bit cliche, it's still good enough to hold my interest. Though the episodes all function as a collective storyline, each one seems to have an individual subplot. Each episode involves the main characters facing a different monster, myth, or urban legend. As an avid lover of the supernatural (no pun intended), most of the information revealed in the episodes about the creatures is common knowledge to me, but I found it to be fairly educational for those not well versed in monsters and myth. Besides that, the brother's reveal this information in casual conversation among themselves in a way that doesn't feel forced or out of place. It's jsut an everyday thing for them.<br /><br />Now, as for the graphics. Because of the nature of this show, a lot of special effects and CGI have to be used. Compared to what we see on the screen nowadays, some of the graphics are . . . Well, down right laughable. But for a series made in 2005-2006, they're pretty good, especially for a television series. (You might be amazed to realize just how much CGI graphics have improved in just a few years.)<br /><br />Overall, from what I've seen so far, this portion of the series seems to have its flaws, but is probably still worth the investment if you enjoy a little gore mixed with your action (and yes, there is gore, and there is action). The first episode alone had me hooked enough to replace the set just to finish the first season AND order the second.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|A little different, but every bit as good as all Grisham novels.  Another one that is very difficult to put down until other chores are done.
B00817RYCG|5.0|An excellent book that came to me in good condition that is definitely worth reading again for fans of any novel.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another loved Grisham novel.  I never cease to be satisfied with novels by John Grisham.  Good story line  --  keeps me away from must do things!

031623480X|5.0|If a group of doctors or scientists were to discover a cure for Alzheimer's disease, anxiety and chronic stress, depression, celiac disease and numerous other debilitating diseases, they would surely become famous, wealthy and perhaps even win a Nobel Prize.  But if the same group showed a clear way to prevent most of these and other diseases, they would struggle to get people to acknowledge or accept their findings.<br /><br />As Ben Franklin observed in 1735 \\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\\"  Unfortunately, in our society, cures are highly prized - means of preventing problems are routinely dismissed.<br /><br />Dr. David Perlmutter - a board certified neurologist and a fellow of the American College of Nutrition - is the author of Grain Brain.  In this book he provides an in-depth look at some of the major health problems in America today and more importantly, how these problems can be prevented simply by changing our diet.<br /><br />\\"...although we are presently ranked first in the world in health-care spending, we are ranked thirty-seventh in overall health-system performance.\\"  \\"We also live in a time when the number of people dying from chronic disease is double that of the number of people dying from infectious disease, maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies combined.\\"  According to Dr. Perlmutter, the problems are directly attributable to our diet.  He compares the diets of our ancestors, which was 75% fat, 20% protein and 5% carbs to our current diets which is 60% carbs, 20% fat and 20% protein.<br /><br />\\"The diseases we see nowadays are largely brought on by our lifestyle not being in harmony with our genetic predisposition\\".  \\"We can change the expression of more than 70 percent of the genes that have a direct bearing on our health and longevity.\\"  The primary focus of the book is the impact poor eating choices has on our brain and all the related problems that entails.  There is also extensive discussion of how consuming far too many carbs has lead to the obesity epidemic currently occurring in America.<br /><br />Unfortunately if your primary care physician is over 50, she/he was probably not trained to understand the importance of proper nutrition.  Many still refer to cholesterol as bad.  Dr. Perlmutter provides many case studies showing there is no correlation between cholesterol and heart disease but there is a correlation between low cholesterol and poor brain function including some chronic diseases.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in avoiding long term debilitating diseases of the brain, improving your long term health, this is a very valuable resource.  Dr. Perlmutter cites dozens of case studies and there is extensive reference material included in the notes.<br /><br />Although the book contains many medical terms, names of various hormones and other unpronounceable  body chemicals, it is surprisingly easy to read.  I certainly would not call it clinical - it was written for the layperson.<br /><br />If you are a serious student of healthy eating, there will be some conflicts between what Dr. Perlmutter advocates and what others have recommended.  It is unfortunate that there is not some absolute authority on this subject.  He dispels many myths about what is good/healthy and what we should avoid.  The biggest takeaway for me was it is okay to eat modest amounts of meats but stay away from most grain based foods.  Carbs and in particular gluten are very harmful to most people.<br /><br />There is a four-week plan for implementing the ideas in this book.  There  is also a chapter containing recipes for cooking/eating in accordance with his concepts.  Finally he does acknowledge that for most people achieving 100% compliance with these concepts is probably not practical.  He suggest you go with the 80/20 rule or even the 90/10 concept.  By following these concepts for the majority of what you eat, you will lose weight without counting calories, be doingyour brain a big favor and greatly improve your health.<br /><br />America cannot afford the cost of unhealthy eating habits.  We must begin to invest more in prevention than cures.  This is a very good addition to the discussion on prevention.your brain a big favor and greatly improve your health.<br /><br />America cannot afford the cost of unhealthy eating habits.  We must begin to invest more in prevention than cures.  This is a very good addition to the discussion on prevention.
B00846REIS|5.0|I've read quite a few reviews that the Crossfire Series is a rip of 50 Shades, not at all! This series so far is a great read! Extensive vocabulary, very well written, dynamite storyline,<br />and cannot wait for the next books to come!
B001OGWY1W|1.0|there is nothing enticing, thrilling or challenging about this plot, it is ll about the violence, the explosions and more violence. please entertain my human mind I'm inquisitive, not just my animal mind with shiny lights and sounds, give me something to think, to ponder, to desire, to look up to. This movie is all a bunch of modern smoke and mirrors that treats me like an idiot monkey, I'm sorry I wasted two hours on it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm not sure why it has taken so long for this kind of device to make it to market, but I'm glad that it has. Hopefully this will lead to bigger and better internet T.V. choices in the future. A little buggy with Microsoft Silverlight conflicting - but otherwise it works well with Netflix and YouTube. I'm not sure what it will take in order to get great internet streaming from other online sources (i.e. anything that can run in chrome should stream fluidly to the TV - but it's still choppy with my connections.

B009AY04A8|1.0|I just didn't enjoy this game. Mostly because of the difficulty doing the hog parts. Oddly, that's the only type of game that I play! Also the finding articles that &quot; belong, or relate to others&quot; didn't make sense. Lastly, the hint button stopped working in chapter seven. The graphics are pretty good and the dialogue, while somewhat dragging at times, was often &quot;witty&quot;. But,it's just no fun.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game truly is amazing. I haven't seen any glitches so far. Oh, and the minions are hilarious!!! I love this game!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|i like the game very much its hard to write much more when i am reviewing five games it just becomes repetitive
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome book. Every word is unsuspecting and you won't be able to stop reading it. You'll love every minute of it
B007THA4FI|5.0|Instead of &#34;Casual Vacancy,&#34; this novel could have been called &#34;Casual Unkindness&#34; or even &#34;Casual Cruelty.&#34; It shows the ease with which many people take out their own unhappiness on each other every day. J.K. Rowling, with her gift for bringing even minor characters to life, also gives them all chances to act differently, to choose the path to being a better person -- but as in real life, most of them don't. With evocative language and dialogue and striking turns of phrase, Ms. Rowling pulls you into the interior lives of the characters and their families.  As a long-time Harry Potter fan, I really enjoyed this complete change of tone and direction from Ms. Rowling.
B00C4QVRAK|5.0|Grew up with it, so of course I love it! And in HD!!! Totally worth the money! Now I can watch it anywhere on my smart devices as well!
B005SMVNKQ|5.0|What a classic! I notices the italian version was cheaper but you can choose English Audio so this was awesome! Fast shipping and perfect packaging!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It has a good look but it is really laggy and always is loading and it stops responding all the time
B003H9M1QM|5.0|The blu-ray quality is as much as they could do for a movie that was done soooo many years ago but everything was perfect!
B007BVOEPI|3.0|It just didn't pull me in.  Been there, done that, feeling.  It moved well and was a visual pleasure, but the storyline of magic and castles has been done already.
B001E45XT4|5.0|This product works great!!!  It blocks all noises, I can not even hear my mom when she calls me.  Great purchase.
1416955070|2.0|I really feel so let down by the ending of this book that I want to puke! I was so captivated by Jace and Clary and the love triangle with Simon, but the author killed any desire I had to continue the series by having Jace and Clary be related. I thought the sarcastic banter between Jace and Clary was so hilarious and made for even more sexual tension between them, but putting in the twist at the end seemed like such a useless literary element that caused me to lose interest in the 2 main characters. It's like reading Twilight and finding out that Bella is really Edward's sister!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it. It does what they say it does which is stream content from Netflix and Google play movies and YouTube flawlessly.
B00498YZH8|3.0|Its a bit of a slow flick and I feel the ending was a bit predicable.  This movie doesn't do a great job of making you care for the characters.  In all, it was an alright movie but I shouldn't have paid to rent it.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|the percy jackson books are my favourate series i like that it focuses on things like greek myths as you do not see them in enough books but i have noticed that they have appered in more as well and i think this is due to the succes of the books and also the making of the films
B00821OX98|4.0|I was a little skeptical at first to watch this show because I thought it might be awful. I do enjoy post-apocalyptic plots so this helps me get my fill.  There are some points that make you scratch your head with the decision making of the characters, but overall its worth trying out.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|The acting was all top notch, except maybe the bounty hunter in the last episode. I am not entirely sure if his quirky dialogue and acting was on purpose or not, either way, it was a little distracting. This is a good take on westerns mixed with sci-fi. Instead of aliens and exploration, this focuses more on people finding their way in the Universe. It starts out strong but getting people together by chance, because they all happen to be going to the same place. They, mostly, have not real reason to stay together but end up needing each other to survive. The character interactions are well thought out and everyone stays in their character. The characters grow and expand as they go through their &#34;adventures&#34;. The only complaint I have is they did not have time to answer all the loose ends because it got canceled after one season. At least the movie, Serenity, answers most of the big ones.
B00005LK94|5.0|Precious precious precious.  I think this flim was made just after Anna won the supporting actress Oscar for The Piano.  She &#34;flies solo&#34; so well in this movie.  Jeff Daniels as the good-guy Dad is fabulous as well.  Then there's fhe Dana Delaney bonus -- always a pleasure.  Anna saves a flock of orphaned baby geese, who naturally imprpint on her, in the absence of geese parents.  Ultimately, it becomes clear that only Anna's character can teach the geese to fly and migrate south.  A little sappy at the end, but a heartwarming delight nonetheless.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I enjoy it even if it gets more difficult by altering targeting versus winning with its increased speed bombardment. have fun.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|I like the special effects of the movie, the storyline is OK. Well suited for teens as an adventure movie.
0486295559|4.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is a later and lesser Austen work, and lacks the charm and grace of \\"Emma\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and does not quite achieve the penetrating and sharp social criticism of \\"Mansfield Park.\\"  Anne Elliott belongs to the impoverished landed gentry, and is imprisoned by  her social standing's expectations and prejudices.  She cannot marry the man she loves because, as merely a captain, he is \\"inferior\\" to her, and cannot easily and immediately provide the fortune that her family expects.  Yet she herself is under dire and distraught circumstances, her family fortune ruined by a father whose vanity trumps frugality and whose devoted love to her eldest daughter, Elizabeth, has meant that Anne is cast aside.  Under the strain of both their noble vanity and their vain spending, the Elliotts seek to reverse their fortune by marrying into fortunes.<br /><br />The main focus of the book is the relationship between Anne and Captain Wentworth, who has returned eight and a half years after Anne first rebuffed him.  He has made his fortune overseas, and he is looking to settle down, and while his pride is still bruised by Anne's rejection he knows she's still the one for him.  Meanwhile, Anne herself must struggle with her emotions, and fight off a suitor her family believes the fittest but whom Anne knows is not right for her.<br /><br />This book is meant to be satirical, but there's actually little humor or fun in this book.  It's worrying how her own family has mistreated Anne, and it's even worrying that in marrying into fortunes no one actually cares how these fortunes were made, and social convention and etiquette requires everyone to be discreet and not ask questions.  A good and reliable person is someone who understands social convention and etiquette, whether or not that person has any real sense of what's right and what's wrong.<br /><br />And so in so many ways the provincial rural center of 19th century British empire feels and looks a lot like modern-day Toronto.
B000I9U8VO|4.0|Well made movie, comic book characters come to life well in the movie, special effects are better, improved from the first movie.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|It has the flexibility and power that I expected to power up my computer having enough to do what ever I wanted to do
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|A friend told me this was a very good movie but I didn't want to see it. I thought:  Great! Now they're just making these wonderful story book characters into warriors or action heroes corrupting the culture with even more war worship or glorified violence. I didn't let my kids see it until I rented it and was pleasantly proved wrong.<br /><br />So there is fighting here but in my opinion it serves the story well rather than supplant it like many other senseless movies do these days. The movie has a message, it's authentic unlike so many of those tired happy endings in much of the Disney movies which are so superficial they do not reflect the lessons the original stories were teaching kids long time ago. I'm talking The Little Mermaid as one of the examples...<br /><br />Well regarding Rise of the Guardians, I say it's definitively worth renting and having in your collection.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Really liked this game, even the story parts. The game flows well. The pictures are  and although small can be seen easily. Rated the game a four.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|I have only used this for evaluating calculus problems, but it is excellent for those. The special characters keyboard is setup well and a real time saver.<br /><br />The only downside is it is either missing or hiding a couple of features from the Wolfram Alpha web page like easily changing between real and complex plots.
B008KE3960|5.0|What an amazing twist on a tower defense game. You pilot ships in direct lines over tanks. And no real money invested if you choose not to. Seriously best tower defense game I've ever played.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|As previous reviewer stated it wants access to personal information. I went ahead and got it since it was the free app of the day and to see if they removed them trying to access your information and sire enough it is still there. I highly recommend you install with caution if you need to install it at.
B00COHIFQS|1.0|don't waste your time on this movie  Almost fell asleep trying to watch it - not a horror film at all
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Video quality is poor. No comparability with chrome for Android devices. It is not usable.<br />I have Google TV that is 200 times more feature and video quality
1781162646|4.0|I usually (but not always!) like Stephen King and this was a very good book, one of the best I've read this year. It was somewhat of a departure for King, in that it was a pretty straightforward coming-of-age story set in the early '70's with minimum elements of fantasy or horror. There is a ghost and a murder mystery involved, but most of it concerns 21-year-old Devin Jones who's recovering from being dumped by his girlfriend and takes a summer job at a down-at-heels amusement park. It was a real page-turner for me and kept me up several nights.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Well worth the wait!  A very good end to a wonderful story.  I have loved all the characters that have been in these books.  Some I wanted to slap and others I wanted to hug.  I lost myself in the story and did not want to stop reading.  Thank you to Brandon and Robert for these escapes into another world.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|used To Love This Game, Good Version For The Phone. Hope There Are Lots Of Levels. You Can Use Both Fingers Too Which Is A Fun Twist.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I really liked the game it could have had a story behind it but it will and always will be one of my top favorites

B00C2IGQBA|5.0|The Batman Steelbook version makes a nice touch to the Batman collection.  There is no artwork inside of the cover on this Steelbook, and the artwork on the back is not stellar either - it is just a semi-silhouetted half shot of Batman, and it is hard to make out any details.  Plus the one I received does not close tight, and likes to pop open, not sure if I have a dud or that is indicative of others out there. I can’t complain too much, the price was right when I bought it at $9.99.<br /><br />This Steelbook only comes with the Bluray disc, and no other discs like some multi-disc and special edition releases – so if you are expecting a DVD Video or Special Features disc, look elsewhere.  This Steelbook is “movie only” which is what I prefer…<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, I have liked this movie since the day it was released - - it gets a little cartoonish and corny in some parts, but Jack Nicholson fills in the gaps nicely with his antics and borderline &#34;loonyisms&#34; which are part of the role of course.  I first purchased this movie in VHS when it first came out, and still have that tape, and for some reason never bought the DVD for this over the years.  I saw it on Network TV (with all its commercial glory) once or twice, but never all the way through.  So it has really been a while since I had seen it uninterrupted and all the way through, and definitely have not seen it in the quality the Blu Ray offers…<br /><br />Watching it on Blu Ray was like watching the movie for the first time - there were all sorts of details, colors, scenes where I just did not recall or pick up on those subtleties from the VHS years ago, nor on the TV broadcast.  It help I watched it on a 65&#34; Panasonic Plasma, and since it is a &#34;dark&#34; movie, the blacks / contrast were nicely displayed.<br /><br />The movie is a Five Star - always thought this movie was entertaining, have seen it over 10 times, and still would watch it again.  The Steelbook is maybe 3.5 to 4 stars - there are ones with better artwork out there, and mine does not stay closed.  But overall I still give it fives stars, it is hard to gauge sometimes if you should be rating the movie or the packaging for these releases… and Amazon blurs the line further by allowing “Prime Video” reviews in the same place you read reviews for DVD / Blurays.3.5 to 4 stars - there are ones with better artwork out there, and mine does not stay closed.

B004AM5QT4|5.0|A totally different genre for Ken Follett.  I had to keep reminding myself this one wasn't written by Michael Crichton.  The mark of great science fiction is believable human reactions to a single leap of science.  Follett's done that with great character development and plotting.  Even if you figure out the twist at the end you'll still be captivated by the way he leads his characters to the solution.  Wish he'd come up with a better ending but that's because I hold Follett to a higher standard.
B005H9B44A|3.0|I thought this was a great kids movie and would recommend it for children of all ages.  Typical super hero movie.
159463176X|4.0|Houssein has become a trust worthy author. Never a disappointing novel. Emotional and intense. The story of a brother and sister. You will read right through the pages with delight and expectations will be met.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games was a great movie.  Followed the book pretty closely.  I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 14 since there was some violence.  Can't wait till the sequel comes out.

015204907X|5.0|My grandchild loves, loves, loves this book.  I got it from the library when she was 18 mos. old.  She was so disappointed when I had to return it and she couldn't find it in her book stack.  At age 2, she points to each page and has almost memorized the content of the whole thing.  It always seems to be a thrill when she &#34;finds&#34; the green sheep sleeping at the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Was having a problem with quality of picture from local TV cable provider. The Chromecast gets around that issue while providing content not available under my cable plan. Am extremely pleased with both price and value.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story can not wait to read the next installment of this series!!!! Will Peeta survive? Will Katniss kill President Snow?
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is your typical hidden object game with some additional puzzles thrown in. I am not fond of the fact that there is no way of pausing the character's dialog so if you look away, you might miss something. I was hoping that there would have been more puzzles in the game other than just the hidden object part but was disappointed that theye were few and far between. Overall, it's an okay game if you are into hidden object games but for me it was just meh. Glad I didn't pay for it.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I'm very satisfied with this product, the only thing that let me down is that the cap of the pen is stuck to the sonic screwdriver so I haven't been able to pull it off.  But that's the only bug I've found, everything else is fantastic!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter and I both play this game.  Good clean family fun.  We both enjoy it very much.  Great game!!
1939416019|2.0|This book is an excellent book if you are under the age of 13. The author attempts to write a book in which battles are fought but absolutely shows no knowledge of tactics. 1 man storms a castle in full knightly armor and succeeds in defeating every foe? 9 men/boys take on 100 foes , warriors who the author describes as being trained from birth?<br /><br />This is a fairy tale for the young or an amusing read. Plot is simple, story line is simple and the price is simple.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|There are three subjects and they build on each other. The first shows that women are still discriminated against in elite executive roles; the second is that woman need to LEAN IN, that is work hard to succeed generally by being deeply committed to their career; and third policy recommendations for feminism.<br /><br />For me, the book reinforces how different it is for the elite executive and the 99% who are not.<br /><br />The best part of the book was the memoir part, which was too brief.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Simple yet addictive. Sense of ergency needed. I didn't pay for this so its good for me. Simple graphics.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|Brilliant job and story!! No doubt better than the first!!! But Jim Carrey wasn't one of the main Actors for some reason

1848507836|5.0|This book was so well written, it flowed thru my mind. So much so that I know I will be rereading it. I do think the last chapter was just a repeat of the whole book, which probably was not necessary. I think after reading what She went through, that I had a near death experience once many years ago too. I just didn't realize it then. I did love this book....I will keep this as a reference guide; lots of good stuff.

B00471JSR4|5.0|I know its Cheesy, but I love this movie. It reminds me of childhood and watching the cartoon. I love it.
0812983459|5.0|This book was the best book I have read in a long time.  I loved the recognition married life.  Harold and his wifeʻs relationship was real.  It was flawed and that is what made it interesting and relatable.  I loved how this book recognized the spark of purity, of selflessness and belief that we all come across, that we are all able to tap into, but donʻt.  I found myself cheering on this fictional character for having the courage to hold true to his course and dismiss the naysayers, those who would pollute the integrity and purity of his intent with their own insecurities.  I enjoyed how the very thing that kept Harold going, was merely a remembrance of his friend.  The strength and importance of which, compelled him forward. I loved this book for so many reasons.  I will keep this book forever, because Iʻm sure I have much more to glean from it still.
1442346949|5.0|Excellent audio and a fascinating story! I learned so much about Jobs' brilliance and his, at times, troubled soul! I would definitely recommend this book!

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|And the introduction of Billy Piper as Rose Tyler!!!!  I think she is a big part of Dr. Who's reboot success!
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Anna Sophia Robb does a great job, as do Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt. We enjoyed the bonus features as much as the movie! Spiritual themes are not the norm for good movies, but &#34;Soul Surfer&#34; is an amazing exception!
1250012570|5.0|Boy, this takes me back to being 16 and desperately in love--that all-encompassing feeling that just overwhelms you. He's half-Korean in a mostly white neighborhood, and thus, doesn't sit with the cool kids at the back of the bus. He just tries to lay low and fly under the radar. (Been there, done that.) Her home life is a mix of abuse, neglect, and abject poverty. She's \\"big\\", has wild red hair, and nothing to work with when it comes to putting together her wardrobe. She sees herself as fat and unattractive. She cobbles outfits together, with ties and squares of cloth pinned in strange places to hide holes and stains on the few pieces of clothing she owns. On her first day at the new school, she knows she won't fit in. When she boards the school bus, she's effectively blocked from seating by everyone. He recognizes her predicament, and although he doesn't want to call attention to himself, he scoots over, allowing her to sit beside him. Thus begins one of the sweetest romances I've ever read.<br /><br />This is no insty romance. They don't even speak for the longest time. He's into X-Men and Watchmen comics and reads them on the bus. She reads over his shoulder. He notices and slows his reading so she can follow. Over time, along with music, their mutual love of comics creates a powerful bond between these two outsiders. Rowell really understands \\"show, don't tell.\\" She shows this relationship forming inch by inch...beautiful. These are two of the most real characters I've read in YA lit. They're complex, flawed, and utterly believable. Their stories are rich and poignant and their voices realistic. The love they share takes me right back to my teen years where every look, every nuance was filled with emotion. This is a sweet love story...doomed, perhaps, but painfully sweet and well worth reading.<br /><br />Pick it up. You'll be glad you did.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome show. No violence, limited sex and profanity, and yet, it's riveting. This is what TV SHOULD be! Can't wait to continue watching the seasons.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Of all the Percy Jackson books, I liked this one the best. Sudden deaths, all bad, surprising twists and gasp-able turns. I mean, what is not to love?
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|Some great writing, but slow in many parts, & reader gets impatient: where  is this story going? Lots of guilt, misplaced drama, & more guilt all around. Animal lovers will love storyline. By  if u are not up for melodrama, skip this book.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The bang for the buck is fantastic here - I'm seriously considering replacing my second original Roku XD with it.  The only downside is that you have to pick up your phone/tablet/PC to get a video started playing on it after you pick up the remote to turn the channel to it.  But the serious upside is that on apps like youtube, once you have the phone or tablet acting as a remote it is fantastic for building up a queue of videos to show people.

I promise that you won't be disappointed, and that the book will get much better : )

0486295559|3.0|Having read Jane Austen's other novels I was expecting more from this one. Although it was a good book to read, it is not a book that I am inclined to read again. This book was, from what I understand, her last piece of work before she died unexpectedly. It seems as though this book was really more of a first draft or a work in progress. I believe it was not totally complete or fine tuned. It certainly does not live up to her other books. Pride and Prejudice is of course my favorite piece written by Jane Austen. Once again, this is a good book but coming into it one should not expect it to live up to her other works.
1576875776|4.0|There are few photographers that can capture the grit of the street and convey an era through just one photo.  Don't get me wrong, some of these images are great, some capture city life like few can,  but as far as street photographers go, there are some that are greater. Weegee and Eugene Smith are just two of the better photographers I can mention when it comes to capturing images of street life. Maier has her merit when it comes to capturing people. She photographs the downtrodden and portraits of people in the street.  She was an unknown in her lifetime, but was discovered with thousands of street scenes and portraits taken. I have only seen this book of her work, so maybe it isn't fair to judge her, but few of the photos jump out and make you say WOW! There are some good street scenes and the photos are very real at times, but most are lacking that quality that Weegee had a natural talent for. A good book overall, but for my taste, I want something that goes beyond just photographing outcasts in the street. ...   FIVE MONTHS LATER  ... I have taken a second look at this book, months later, and feel like I have missed plenty. The problem with photographers like Maier, someone else has to look at her work and decide what goes into a book. The images in this book are much better than the two stars I previously gave the book. She is not on the level of Wee-Gee or Eugene Smith, but she is a talent in her own right. Sorry about the two stars and see the doc. on her life. This is the first time I have ever revised a review and upped the the stars. That says something about Maier and her work. In brief, she really grows on you.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show! If you like witty, funny and great acting in your tv dramas.....I highly recommend you watch this show. You will definitely agree the chemistry between the actors really helps you enjoy every minute!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I saw this segment on 60 Minutes and couldn't believe it. I had to rent it on NetFlix and watched it twice it was so compelling.  The man is the story and the man is the message of the story at the same time. Sixto Rodriguez releases the album, \\"Cold Fact\\" in the United States in 1970. The album gets critical reviews, but sells less than 10 copies in the US. However, a copy ends up in South Africa,  and inspires the Anti-Apartheid movement.  Rodriguez is the Bob Dylan of South Africa and doesn't even know it. The artist works as a common laborer in Detriot and his music sells and inspires a nation and a movement. Strange ... yeah, but it gets even better. For decades there is the rumor that Rodriguez killed himself on stage, so no one in South Africa goes looking for him, until a journalist tries to track him down decades later.  The movie is one part art, one part detective story, one part political ideology,  and all inspiration. The man Rodriguez is the real story and his nature of being inspirational by his music and his lifestyle. There is very little of Sixto Rodriguez talking in this film and it just isn't him. As far as documentaries go, this is one of the best in presentation and relaying the story in an easy manner. A must see and an inspiration to all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a game where you can go on adventures fight monsters ,build, and it doesn't require you to depend on someone to do something, you think of what you want and you build it is not like the real world where it costs $1,000,000 dollars to build something it only costs $7.00 (and then some if you want accessories like block launcher pro) to do whatever you think up.
0812982622|5.0|This novel is one of the best I have read in years.  The author gives the reader everything one could want.<br /><br />Johnson provides a subtle historical perspective, shocking cultural insight, thrilling suspense and heartbreaking romance.  I highly recommend it.  There are a just a handful of books that I re-read.  This is one I want to read again.
B008220D5K|4.0|Yes, having these experiences in life may be required for enjoyment of this movie, but this movie is how many people act in real life!  It's witty, funny, different from all the crap in theaters now.
B009G41CG2|1.0|I do not like this particular game the HD version is better, I got used to the HD version first
B000FS9FC6|5.0|Good acting and suspense in this SciFi drama.  I have already watched the move twice.  I highly recomend the movie.
0515142247|5.0|Once again, kept me glued to the book!  Exciting and suspense through out! Another great read. Highly recommend this book.<br />Ray
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan, you will find this is a very entertaining musical.  I enjoyed the movie very much.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I'm sorry it took me so long to finally read this book. The topic is one that has given me great pause most of my life. I would recommend this to teens and adults.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|New twist: the ability to upgrade your weapons brings needed life to a classic. Great game! Just get it, it's free and a good time waster.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We like it very much!! Happy to have it! Totally worthy for money.  It works wireless with our lap top and the picture and sound on Netfilx and Youtube are great. The only limitation I have noticed so far is a small number of applications (so far Netflix, Youtube and Chrome), but I understand they are working on developing new apps, so soon, this will be 'a must have' device at home. And one more thing I have noticed with Netflix is that it's not playing a sequence of episodes right  after each other. You always have to start it manually, but I am guessing this improvement will be featured soon also. So, yes, I am recommending it.
1476734941|4.0|good book..very informative, easy read.i understand much more about how people can go a day or two on very little calories
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|&quot;Internet access required to use this app&quot;<br />Why? Is this an internet app or note making app?<br />My galaxytab isn't always connected to the internet and I NEVER connect to the internet when using any app with wonky permissions, I never got a chance to try it so I really can't value it's usefulness.<br />Uninstall immediately.
B000002OTL|5.0|An irresistible soundtrack with tasty snippets of dialogue from the film! Tarantino is the master of this genre and the mix of great actors delights all the way through!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|After purchasing I heard these type of sharpeners can ruin your blade. After using on some of my knives I would agree that they don't hold a edge as long as they did when sharpened with stones.
B001W79MB8|5.0|Worth the wait...never understood why it was so expensive for so long.  Must be the vagaries of the movie business.
0553382179|5.0|I am hoping to put to practice more of the routines that Flylady gives us in this book.  It is a great instruction manual for learning to clean and maintain your household!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|not as good as jailbroken apple tv 2 with XBMC installed on it but great as a replacement for connecting your laptop using HDMI cable to your tv...
B009MYARIK|4.0|A fun, easy read.  Another great book by a great author. Sophie Kinsella can write a book that makes you fall in love with every quirky character.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Looks similar to Microsoft Word. Easy to use. Wish it could convert to PDFs. Like the option to upload to the cloud.
B000003FMY|4.0|Great recording for my Granddaughter, aged 11 to her on her new bookshef stereo.  Lots of good stereo sound and a great pice of program music for a youngster playing cornet in her Middle<br />school Band.  Easy to follow wht is happening in the music and well played by the CSO of many years ago.
B00640UICA|4.0|Joining Hands was free, so I said, &#34;Why not?&#34; I've enjoyed the challenge. I believe it has over 100 levels. Also, there is nothing offensive about the content either, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone, even families with little kids. This is a great, free, well executed app. I like it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Awesome game. Highly addictive. Needs more levels. Overall not bad in the world of mind numbing persuits. It beats watching paint dry or cutting grass. Lol
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I finnally splurged and down loaded it to my kindle, and I can't get through it... slow, slow... slow, I expected LOL and didn't get it.
0425263924|5.0|I really love this book !  The characters have touched me.  I really want there to be another in this series.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I watched it, but I don't remember it so I am guessing it wasn't all that. Though I do remember it to be funny.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is better than any temple run or any thing like that.  Temple run is boring I like this and you will to
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|A real winner of show tunes, and they haven't been sung any better.  It was good to hear someone sings duets with Susan to give those songs more punch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it but found the last show of season 6 too very sad, It is such a beautiful show to watch in the era of the 20's,
1594203334|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library and loved it so much  I bought this copy so I could mark it up!  As with any parenting book, there are parts that I don't agree with but in general I thought it had some wonderful concepts, and was so well written.  Arrived quickly and in great condition.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game is fun and very addictive ...I recommend you to try it.. I rate this five stars and it has extra fun puzzles...
1568363931|4.0|I loved the colorful pictures and ideas presented in this book.  It would have been nice to have gone all out, and included pictures of the alternate recipes as well, as there are more alternate recipes than main recipes. i would have been willing to pay extra to see pictures of all of the recipes.<br /><br />the timing chart was a bit confusing for me, and for my taste, too much narrative writing for a cookbook.
B0098460O4|5.0|I first saw Jonathan & Charlotte in their You Tube appearance on &#34;America's Got Talent.&#34;  They were astounding there and this CD only underscores how good they are, especially with a full orchestra behind them.  I'm looking forward to hearing more from them!
B002FL3JA0|5.0|I have played a lot of these songs with my old jazz combo, and they never go out of style.  I lost my old paperback edition, so it was nice to see this available for Kindle.
B009193OCM|3.0|I used to love the lonely planet. Their books have always been a great guide no matter where I traveled. But, it seems that the world of digital has caught up with them, as well, as the kindle guide is not very friendly - well as compared to  other solutions. For those going to NYC, I highly recommend the apps NY Times, the scoop and also NYC way.
B005EIS5IW|5.0|these comics are really fun, I can't wait for the next volume to come out.  as a catlover, i really enjoyed this.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Streaming is limited to You Tube and Netflix.  Must us Googlechrome for laptop use.  Price was right with the 3 free months of Netflix.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|It is ok but kinda crazy to think how much thought had to have gone into making this product not to make some pretty basic design choices.  For example, the wrist band is only really meant for sleeping and is a pouch instead of what could have been a stylish wrist strap for wearing the device more like a watch during both day and night.  So do you really want to put this on your belt every day or in your pocket then move it to your wrist every night?  I would rather it just be more like a watch with a thin velcro strap and snap in plastic housing on my wrist.  Along the same lines to get to the time display you hit the button 6 times.  I would much prefer time to be the first display so it can be used more like a watch.  Along these lines it would be a bit more attractive as square instead of a long rectangle.<br /><br />Also, the finish is very dull and because of this the display is blurry.  It is even harder to see through the fabric pouch which has a mesh over the display.  Why not make it clear and unrestricted in the pouch?  Almost impossible to read with any sun or in a bright room.<br /><br />The pulse sensor is totally unprotected on the back.  Seems like it should be at least coated with something to protect it.  It does seem to be decently accurate, unlike their scale.  The whole housing is not at all water resistant which can cause issues even if the wrist strap becomes at all damp for example washing your face before bed.<br /><br />The software in general is OK other then the above time display being last, but it seems to fail bluetooth sync if not initiated in the right order with your phone.  For example if you start the sync and then turn on bluetooth on your phone it just spins forever.  You must already have bluetooth on before initiating the sync.  The sync takes quite a long time considering the small amount of info it really needs to send.  It would be much improved by implementing at least a very basic compression scheme on the transfer sincemost of the data is predictable.<br /><br />In general it needs a software update and a better wrist strap.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|i am not quite the target audience (i am a newlywed, 40ish former stepmom) but this was a terrific read. yes, i am aware that most teenagers aren't like these kids. my spouse works at a childrens cancer hospital and i am hopeful that my reading this lovely book will help me be a better support.
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|I love the entire album. Every song is distinct and hypnotic.<br />This is a great album to dance to. It is very tight.
B002VECM4A|2.0|I'll concede this: once I started watching *Precious*, I couldn't stop. So it did grab my attention and I did get immersed in it. But afterwards, I started wondering: would this film get such acclaim for being so \\"compelling\\" if Precious had been light-skinned and attractive, and her babies fathered by two different teenagers from her neighborhood rather than her own father? If her mother beat her, not in some systematic attempt at sadism, but because the mother herself was raised in an environment where throwing things at your kids' heads was considered a normal way to discipline them? Something uncomfortable in me says it would not, because for white people that would be the way they assume all black people live. *Precious* takes stereotypes to an extreme, perhaps to get over that hump. But to me it just made the film seem artificial. And the ending did not seem hopeful to me. In the era the film is set in, AIDS was an instant death sentence. All we see is Precious walking into the sunset with her kids (who seem completely undamaged even though they were born into the same family as Precious). In real life, Precious would've died within a year or so, meanwhile having no idea how to raise her kids in a loving home because the only example she ever had was her own mother. It just didn't ring true to me. I would've liked to end up feeling hopeful, as the movie tried to do, but there was just too much that seemed contrived and too neatly wrapped up. I would like to see a film that gave a more nuanced view of the world Precious came from.
B008OW1S3O|4.0|worth a purchase...I enjoy listening to this late at night while reading<br />or writing an article....i like his voice too
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a cool little piece of hardware. It will be better yet when more applications and video sources are supported. But it is very cool to select a movie or show from Netflix on my phone, then use the phone to tell Netflix to send the stream directly to the TV without and further use of phone resources.
B002QNLP2G|5.0|This film illustrates the fine line between genius and insanity. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as an Australian pianist that struggles to maintain sanity while being relentlessly pushed by his father's dreams of greatness for his son. Based on the true story.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I am enjoying watching this series while I am in my sewing area.  Wonderful.. Well worth the investment.  Just do it.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Classic movie I could watch this about once or twice a year forever. Shipped very fast with Amazon Prime and was in my DVD player even faster.
B001VNB54A|5.0|For the first time,, watched the &#34;extras&#34; on this DVD.  And they are quite good.  So is the series in Blu-Ray.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Greta movies and a great value.  My kids and the neighborhood kids had a blast watching these outside for outdoor movie night.
1408842432|5.0|As usual great read.  Look forward to the fifth & final installment. I am anxiously a Waiting for next April
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Pretty good movie. Keeps you a little in suspense trying to figure out what secret the character will unveil. nice twist in plot.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's a good missile defense game but it gets a but boring as time marches on. I'll play it here and there but it's not something that makes me want to pick up the phone
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think that this game is a great game because it works your brain well and it is a puzzle game. My complaint about this game is because it was to easy to solve. I play the game a lot even though the game is finished and wished for more levels.
B009AY04A8|4.0|If you like hidden objects games then this is a must play. The graphics are great, the storyline is easy to follow, and I had no problems.I would recommend this game to anyone who loves mystery mixed with a hidden objects game.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This was a original movie based on characters, plot and special effects. The acting was top notch, the plot was original and I enjoyed it. The special effects were over the top. Over all I would give this movie a A+. The final discoveries made the movie reminiscent of old Saturday Sci-Fi movies I watched as a kid. So would I say this is a great movie, yes I would. Buy and watch it you will not be sorry.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Got interested after the movie came out. Decent read. Can't say I'll buy another right away. Too many other better options.
B008602KQI|3.0|Good movie just a little to much violence involving children for me to enjoy the movie. Just not the movie for me.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This movie was a thriller from beginning to end. There was enough action to satisfy as well as a touch of drama so the action buff and the chick flick enthusiasts were satisfied.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Victor Hugo was a great writer and Les Miserables is probably one if not his best. The English version may lack some of the quality of the original but it was a good read.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|I love this series of book. Whilst this was not my favourite one, it's still a good read. Now, onto the next one!
B00821OX98|1.0|Just couldn't get into this show, everyone at work seems to like/watch it. Noah acted better on ER. Story moves too slow.
0143036424|4.0|The Cold Dish is a good but not perfect mystery offering,  apparently the genesis of an ongoing book series and an A & E televison series I have not seen.<br /><br />There was much to enjoy in the story.  Walt Longmire and his side kick Henry Standing Bear are colorful and entertaining.  You get a real taste for Absaroka and its inhabitants,  Anglos and Indians.  There is also quite a bit of excellent writing about the beautiful, rugged Wyoming scenery.<br /><br />The mystery itself was gripping without being the most intricate one I have ever read.  There was a nice mixture of sheer mental effort to figure out \\"whodunit\\" with rather subtle social commentary on such far flung topics as child abuse, over permissive sentencing, gun violence, the aftermath of Vietnam and its effect on veterans,  and the treatment of Native Americans.  None of this was preachy.  It all fit in nicely within the frame of the mystery.<br /><br />Which is not to say that there were not some flaws.  Walt and Henry were perhaps too clever for their own good.  They were quirkier than they needed to be,  and that would go for the whole county.  It was a little like \\"Northern Exposure\\",  moved south and put on speed.  The ending of the book, the solving of the mystery was to my mind a little forced.  The clues were hardly inevitable, and there was  a real lack of nexus between the revenge and the motive for it, at least as to these particular victims.  I won't say more so as to not spoil the story.  Don't put too much faith in the Vasques size 9 boots, however, or worry about them very much.  They are a disappointing throwaway.<br /><br />On balance,  I thought the book was entertaining, fun to read,  if not absolute top of the line.  A deserved four stars,  not five.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|I'm a RAIN n martial arts fan.... This movie is Waaay goood !!! Enjoyed it so much that it seemed like it was over so quickly. Plot had me glue to the screen.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I absolutely love this series it is amazing and just keeps getting better and better! Can not wait to read the next one!! Richelle Mead you rock!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game a must download reminds me of missile command from the 80s. If you liked that game you will love this one.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a fun, silly game. I love the hidden picture games, though, so enjoying that part.  Can't quite figure out the story line, but really is irrelevant.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Loved the way it was written, kept my attention and kept me awake at night.  I understand now how a pandemic is possible.
1594744769|5.0|A little dark for a young adult book, but a good story.  The photos and the way they were brought into the plot was really ingenious.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is as enticing in the 21st century as when it was written in the last.  It gives me hope that all those games our children are playing are not just to keep there minds away from the real problems of the day. LOL
B007HUD6OS|5.0|AMAZING BOOK AND SERIES YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY READ IT<br />JOHN GRISHAM IS AN AMAZING AUTHOR. HIS BOOKS ARE THE BEST OUT THERE!
B005LW5J9O|4.0|I enjoyed the story.  I would have liked a little more on the impact of the poem on modern thought.
B009AY04A8|3.0|A simple game, but fun. Would have been disappointed if I had bought it. Good free game, a few challenging puzzles.
B003K15INU|4.0|Philip Roth is a terrific writer, but I do not enjoy some of the things he writes about.  His later works reflect the pattern of American Pastoral, brutal story with a few pages of hope at the end.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I really like Lana's Del Rey's 60's vibe. Her sound is somewhat soft, but her lyrics are bold, which makes her so unique.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|this download isnt even worth anything! I doesnt play any more or less media than the good old fashion one that came with your device
B00B6QXN56|4.0|Joe Bonamassa is a really great guitarist. This album is a compilation of excellent songs. I really love his music.
B00004OCQ2|5.0|If you are a Jake E. Lee fan at all - this CD is worthy!  The singer - the late Ray Gillen is AMAZING - somewhere between Robert Plant and David Coverdale.  A definite must-have for your collection!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This stupid app was stuck downloading at 13% and when I tried again It would not let me install. It says Internal Storage Low so It first doesn't download then it takes up my space! It has me deleting my games for nothing. Becarefull.
B000002IJO|5.0|If you like RATT or 80's rock - you need this CD.  RATT is truly one of the best bands from that time!  Oh yeah, they are still touring, too!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Excellent movie! Seen it before, but we bought this for our 1 yr old son. Loves it; one of his faves!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is amazing. Smart, hilarious, so good at what she does. I literally laughed out loud when reading this, sometimes even cried it was so funny. Highly recommend it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This app functions well and the towers are appropriately difficult. I don't automatically win but I can win enough to keep me interested.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and fast paced!  If you like Bingo, you will love this one!  Start in Plano (this room doesn't use power ups), bank the power ups from the chests for the tournament room!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|The guitar range of Joe Bonamassa shows through. Rock; Melodies; Hard Blues; Sorrowful Blues. He speaks with his music. Worth as good listen.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|If you have a go pro this is a must have. It works flawlessly with my go pro. Simply attaches and starts to work.
B00377V6J2|5.0|The late and great Stevie Ray Vaughn once again shows his musical genius. He can fall into any song at any time and it sounds better for him being there. Albert King recognizes this and has a lot of praise for Stevie Ray. The accompanying DVD movie of the recording between these two greats makes me sad seeing Stevie Ray and knowing he is no longer with us. But he gave us all musical blessings while he was here.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Good for small kids to play but be carefully on in app purchases that could get expensive if a child pushes the wrong buttons
B00002MZ4V|4.0|You can really enjoy this music while driving, you can remember movie scenes or emotions from classic movies. I enjoy it frequently.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is all about what it has and what it doesn't have. Here's what MISSLE DEFENDER doesn't have:<br />1. Fancy hi-res graphics.<br />2. A slammin music soundtrack.<br />3. A deep storyline.<br />Here's what Missle Defender DOES have:<br />1. Great sound effects.<br />2. Unbelievably awesome control!<br />3. The best reason to keep playing......IT'S FUN!<br />As a gamer who remembers when the Atari 2600 first hit the store shelves, I sometimes reminiscence for the days when gameplay was king and graphics were considered secondary. Nowadays it's the exact opposite.  Most games released within the past 10 years focus on extraordinary graphics, but treat. actual gameplay as an afterthought.<br />Not this game.<br />As mentioned earlier, MISSLE DEFENDER lacks graphical polish, but totally excels in the area of gameplay. Basically,  if you're familiar with the Atari classic MISSLE COMMAND, you'll be right at home with this game. There are a few advancements however, and fortunately they're also in the gameplay department.  Among them are the ability to improve your anti-missle-missle power, speed, inventory and much more. Additionally,  damaged buildings and trees (yes, trees) can be repaired if you know what you're doing.<br />Although the lack of BGM (background music) may seem odd, it actually helps you focus on the task at hand......saving the city from nuclear annihilation!<br />Basically, if you want a game where it's obvious the developers placed gameplay above graphics within the design, MISSLE DEFENDER deserves your attention.  EXTREMELY WELL DONE!!
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|This is an excellent sequel to the original sparkle. The graphics are beautiful. Very well made game. If you liked the first one, you'll be just as pleased with the second.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very  amazing book. I cried and laughed. All-around an amazing book. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Two thumbs up.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|As many have already pointed out there are ads here. In a paid for ap. Really? One star for making an incredibly [insert explitive] move.<br /><br />Remove the ad-riddled splash screen and I will change my rating to 5 stars.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Love this games keeps you thinking...you should get it. It's so much fun and it it gets a high rating from me. So get it you will play it all the time.,
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the story.  it was light hearted. Interesting and romantic without too much graphics.  My first time reading Mira Kelly and it held my interest!  Will definitely read her again
B00DJWV11I|3.0|The book was OK. I didn't like the fact that there was really no plot. I also did not like how for every situation the Hero just went on and on about his past experiences, it got old pretty quick.Overall, the book was funny but thats the only think I found that I liked. The price is too high for this book and the ending was a little rushed and maybe this happened because the author spent too much time with the hero reminiscing and by the time the ending was near it was thrown together. I would not recommend.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Its pretty simple to play. I got it as a free app and it is worth every penny i paid for it.
B00E13ZRFA|5.0|\\"Burn\\" by Ellie Goulding is an empowerment musical anthem that encourages a message of feeling good in life. The online music video more clearly expresses the message of the song.  \\"Burn\\" by Ellie Goulding is perfect for those preferring a bright and optimistic song with electronic and pop music influences.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. It's great special effects and action, with a truly well written plot. It has great Star Trek moments and a fantastic twist on Wrath of Kahn. Very worth watching doesn't disappoint.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Makes you really think. I can't believe how many times you can really get stuck. It makes you feel stupid once you figure it out
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is a blast I love it.  Having a blast with this game lots of fun. Highly addictive game.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I would be hard pressed to say what ONE song is my favorite from Dire Straits.  After all, when one has talent enough to play the guitar like Mark Knopfler and also has the talent to write and play not only fantastic songs but songs made for his own voice, well, I'm thrilled!<br /><br />Telegraph Road has got to be one of his best songs - ever.  It isn't just a song, it's an epic story.  I marvel at his talent.  He is rivaled by none in his guitar playing.  And very few voices carry the words he delivers in the style that he delivers them in.  Face it, Knopfler is a genius at his craft.
1455526959|5.0|Another winner for Connelly. Harry Bosch is still at work, but in jeopardy because of his dogmatic supervisor who is constantly trying to get Harry on &#34;the team&#34;. A team which is only imaginary, as the staff uniformly loath him.<br />A good plot with the usual twists and turns.
0810988232|5.0|I've come back to rewrite this review, after having used the deck for nearly two months.  I have four oracle decks now--including Brian Froud's other deck, \\"The Faeries' Oracle\\"--and this one is by far my favorite.  It's the one I'm always reaching for each morning to do my daily draws, and the messages in each card are always really clear and to-the-point.<br /><br />Though I love all of Brian's artwork, I really prefer this deck to his first.  However, I will say that the guide book to this deck isn't quite as good as the one that accompanies \\"The Faeries' Oracle.\\"  It just doesn't go as in-depth as far as getting to know the cards, and I have to say I learned a lot more once I'd read the other book!<br /><br />There was another review somewhere for this deck, where the person mentioned the cards were flimsy and nowhere near the quality of \\"The Faeries' Oracle.\\"  Having just bought that deck about a month ago, I can say that both decks are the same in terms of cardstock.  Maybe the publishing company made them all a bit more cheaply, but the cards of both decks are equally thin, with only a slight gloss to them.  That's a real disappointment, because the artwork is just so amazing, and these flimsy cards don't do them justice.<br /><br />Other than that, however, I can't say enough good things about \\"The Heart of Faerie,\\" and I really recommend you give it a try.  If Brian's artwork speaks to you, then I think you're going to really like this deck!
B005OYKIAO|5.0|I love the fast and furious movies. This movie doesn't disappoint. Action, Paul Walker, Vin Diesel. Yum! Most sequels get cornier and worse as time goes on but these get better and better!
B005ORVMT2|5.0|With my husband being a fan of the music, I saw how buying all 3 together saved some $ so got them all. He has plenty to listen to now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I think this game was amazing! I loved it so much even though it was challenging...but in a good way! It kept me so entertained, the story was great and I can't wait for the others. Good job Fireproof!
B005ORVMCY|5.0|I bought this set for my husband since he is a fan of their music. He really likes the set.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|it was an awesome book even though it was about demons and such and I enjoyed it a lot.  I would not of read it if it would not of been for Sara
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|My husband likes the music of Rush so buying the set really beats having to buy all the individual CD's.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Graphics are great many levels dialogue a little too much but still a lot of fun would highly recommend this one fun for the whole family
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's early, so I am hopeful it will become better as the months go by.  Currently, I am not 100% sold on it due to a few main concerns of mine.<br /><br />&#62; Because it streams from your device over the internet to your HDMI - the battery drain on your device crushes it.  I expected some of this, but I had not expected it to drain this badly.<br />&#62; Although I can view Netflix, YouTube, and some things from Chrome (the browser) I am disappointed I cannot view my Android phone Gallery.  I have a lot of photos and videos of my kid on my phone, and find it a pain to have to upload everything on my phone to the internet just to then display on my TV for people to see them.  I am hoping this will get adjusted also.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|NOTE: this version is NOT tuned for the kindle fire and HD. The version that is tuned for Kindle is NOT the free app of the day today and can be found here: [[ASIN:B007XWNWBC AppBody Handy Note Pro]]<br /><br />Imagine a note taking app that does just about everything, literally. This developer thought of everything! Even so, there are lots of addons that you can get for this some of which are not free (The developer calls them \\"respacks\\" which I assume stand for \\"resouce packs\\" and about 12 are available. Pack #'s 1-5 are free and 6-12+ are currently 99 cents each). As for these \\"respacks\\", I am not sure why they are needed-- it just seems like a lot of bloat to me. To be honest, this app also sometimes feels confusing and overdone. That just might be me and I'm not going to subtract any stars until I use it some more and IF I find something wrong. As of yet, I fail to find anything wrong with it. It works and it works well. You can password protect everything and keep it secure. (I like that because not many note taking apps actually  do not allow for that and I find it to be important.)<br /><br />I really wouldn't mind if the developer would just quit with all the extra addons and upsells and just either fold them into the app (to give value) or just simplify things somehow. Does it really need to be this complicated? Well, for some, it might, I suppose. That's why I am not giving this a bad review. I don't think it would be fair at this point. I will update this review, however, if I change my mind and will give an explanation, if so.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book is great. It keeps you interested in reading it. Sad and funny parts, but you never know which way the story is going to go. Great book!! :)
1781162646|5.0|Quick read, suspenseful, entertaining.....that's all I need from Stephen King!  Once I picked it up and got beyond the &#34;cheesy&#34; cover (which is actually perfect or this type of story)...I read it in two sittings....only because I had to go to work!  Otherwise, it would have been one sitting...that's how much I enjoyed this little book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I would recommend this game for some fun quick action on a well polished game.  There are four upgrade options between each round and you can use points to upgrade or repair damage.<br />I loved missile command for Atari 2600
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I love the album.  I can't say nothing is wrong with it.  I have been jamming it for the pass week and can't seem to dislike it at all.
0735619670|4.0|Well written and mostly an easy read.  The concepts are described in an easy way to understand.  A lot to go through, so there will be things you already know, but it's always good to refresh yourself.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any developer to reinforce good practices and to realize where you can improve.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a must have.  If you don't get it you will be limiting great watching.  My family and I use for &#34;movie night&#34; so it promotes everyone spending time together.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|The Crow One for $5?! You must be kidding me!<br />The camera work is absolutely beautiful! Call me silly if you want, but I really like the story!<br />Brandon Lee RIP. Brandon and Bruce are both rest in a better place!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book took me by surprise! I had no notions about it's plot before I sat down to read it and boy oh boy was I surprised! As it's a short book, I read through it quite quickly only to immediately start reading it again to see what details I had missed the first time. The book was even better the second time round!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Can't get enough of this story line. When will Season 4 be available for Prime holders? Can't wait!!<br />I do hope Season 4 goes further into the life of Colinda. She is a very mysterious and intriguing person.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I almost stopped reading during the first chapter because I could see where it was headed.I am so glad I didn't!  The next time I picked it up,I couldn't put it down.  Beautiful, descriptive writing and a gripping story.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors. His pull no punches writing leaves no room for doubt about the facts of evolution. His books are very informative and fun to read.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Neil Gaiman is becoming one of my favorite authors. This charming book has an overall air of hopeful sadness that is as complex as any you will find in life, yet one gets the sense of careful and patient concern throughout, that raises the work from fairy tale to moral metaphor.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Addictive but keep resetting after about a week or so. All in all great game to past the time. Would recommend.
1616551100|5.0|The writing is spot on, fitting this classic tale into a condensed and rather short graphic novel. Jamie Chase's artwork is mind bogglingly brilliant, creating the absolute perfect atmosphere. I'm sure Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be very pleased, not only to know that his work is still loved and admired after so long, but also pleased that Powell and Chase have remained true to the story, while simultaneously making it extremely accessible to the 21st century. An easy five-star rating.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Hard to follow in a lot of places. Just as well I saw the movie first. Could slip all the waffle.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|great family movie.  very creative.  made me laugh out loud.  i am sorry i did not see it earlier than this.
B00417HV14|5.0|Anything from Joe Bonamassa is fantastic.  I love this guy's guitar and his singing voice.  It was great to be able to actually see what I hear without buying an expensive ticket.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addicting. Lots of fun and different.  Need more games like this.  My 9 year old likes it too. Not very hard to play.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|on phones and the original Kindle fire the Amazon app store has a nasty habit of downloading the installer for programs,  installing the program,  and just leaving the installer file just hanging out.  ultimately this gobbles up your free space twice as fast as you might expect.  this utility is a fantastic solution, and covers many other bad caching issues at the same time.  with an impossible to beat price tag,  this is one of my favorite apps.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I really wanted this app to be good, but it's just the opposite! Undisclosed permissions, unnecessary permissions, in app purchases and internet connection requirement all add up to spooky, spooky, spooky. FAotD or not, I'm uninstalling it.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Great performances by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman... and any movie narrated by Morgan Freeman just can't go wrong.
B0086700CM|5.0|I luv this game and so does my family. My sister will just ask the all day to let her plays it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic. Kate Morton does a wonderful job developing the characters and the plot line. There are so many twists and turns including a final twist that I.did.not.see.coming. I couldn't put it down and read it in three days. This book will not disappoint...Highly recommend it!
B0058BI896|5.0|this show manages to stay fresh season after season. Even as the characters become familiar--the situations are still fresh and inviting.  Great for all ages.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I heard this on Pandora and immediately went to Amazon to buy.  I love it and will be buying more.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|Don is an associate professor in genetics who is also socially awkward. We get the impression that he's affected by Asperger's syndrome, though this doesn't occur to him. He fusses, hating chit chat and explaining too much science and statistics in conversation. He doesn't know that some of his interactions are funny, and doesn't care if others see him as amusing.  All evidence to the contrary, there must be a wife out there for him. If you enjoy 'The Big Bang Theory' you will love THE ROSIE PROJECT.<br /><br />Aged thirty-nine and in a position to meet intelligent women, Don fails to relate to them or socialise.  He micro-manages his time although he is kind and friendly to an older neighbour. A girl is interested in talking to Don, and he decides to create a questionnaire to help him sort out who is a potential wife. It would save him getting to know people who weren't ideal as he has very particular preferences. Gene and Claudia, Don's married friends, invite him to dinner with their family and work on his questionnaire.  They advise some practise in case the right woman does respond to his on-line invite.<br /><br />Rosie is a lively redheaded girl in a black dress with chains, boots, and glasses. Gene sends her to meet with Don and Don immediately makes a dinner appointment.  We don't know what's going to happen, but even before Don tries to wear his yellow rainproof cycling jacket into the posh restaurant and ends up using his aikido skills on the two doormen, we know it's going to be funny.  Don's a good cook, provided his routine isn't disrupted, and over a lobster salad he creates he assures Rosie that she's quite intelligent for a barmaid.<br /><br />Unconventional Rosie is a finely written heroine. Don's evident proficiency in many areas means that he isn't being drawn for pathos or ridicule.  Rosie needs help which the professor's expertise can provide, so they continue to meet.  Don is distressed when he is given a warning by the Dean. If he cannot fit in at the science department of a university, he knows he cannot fit in anywhere. Meanwhile his friend Gene is behaving in a way which most people, including his wife, would consider extremely incorrect.  I loved the sparkling tale which is set in Melbourne (but could have been set in any university town) and visited some unexpected locations, and the more I read, the more I just had to keep reading. This book won the Victorian State Premier's Literary Award in 2012.in at the science department of a university, he knows he cannot fit in anywhere.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This was a excellent buy. All of my favorite actors in one show! They did an excellent job making an old story come to life in a new way. More geared toward adults, but still a great show.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|This is a really good book even if it makes one squeamish and uncomfortable.  The story reads easily and one can't help but relate with the protagonist as she is clearly weak on her distress tolerance skills and eventually wanders down the murky paths of mental healthcare.  Inevitable that we would then Google the authoress to learn more about the actual person behind this semi-autobiographical book and feel sorrow for her pain.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|My granddaughter is a big fan of Hawaii 50.  I bought this for her for a birthday present.  She absolutely loves it.  During the summer, she would watch several episodes each day.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is nice and works well for me at least.  You can view any online web page on your TV using this device.<br />I was disappointed in the fact it will not play videos from your folders/files on your computer that have been downloaded from the web.  It was not advertised as doing this, but thought just maybe it would.<br />I have a Netflix subscription and have used it a lot for that.  Am hopeful that other program, similar to Netflix<br />will be added in the future and that the device can be updated.  We shall see.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This is a masterpiece. I liked the song \\"Home\\" when it came out a few years ago and recently took a chance on the entire album. I'm so glad that I did. This band is so unique and somehow manages to weave complex and layered ideas across several musical genres and then put it in one song. I expect big things for this band over the years to come. Buy the entire album and listen to it from start to finish. You will be glad you did.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Weird and juvenile.  Wish the reviews that prompted me to buy it had mentioned that.  Wouldn't have wasted the money.
0451169514|5.0|After countless years of deliberation, I have finally read this book. Words can't explain how much I enjoyed this wonderfully written novel, and why I waited so long to read IT? I finally sat down, and committed myself to this novel, and glad that I did. King can be a little winded at times (when isn't he?) but the overall story is well worth it. Friendship, loyalty, love, suspense, tragedy, horror, coming of age,,, it's all here. Read IT, and enjoy IT!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn made me fall in love with the characters and hate them at the same time.  I didn't know who I was rooting for and kept switching teams.<br /><br />I read a lot of good reviews about this book, but for some reason I never got past chapter 3 when I put the book down for a few months.  Big mistake.  I started over and after chapter 5 (the chapters are short, so that's only about an hour's reading), I was hooked.<br /><br />This is a great summer read; a page turner you can submerse yourself into.  Good, easy reading with a suspenseful plot twist.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been into MTG for a long time but have never had the cash to get a decent deck together. This app lets me play a game I love at minimal cost. In addition, it plays very nice on the kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought this device a bit skeptical but when I began using it was very easy to fall in love with. This thing sends any webpages from chrome to your screen without a flickr or a second thought. It's fast, streams fast, I can use my laptop and iphone or ipad and no longer need to connect my blueray player to get netflix on my tv. Great product for a great price...
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Outstanding book! Learned so much about myself and would recommend this for everyone to read and discover the real meaning and purpose of life.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game reminds me of team fortress two on the pc. This is one one of my favorite games for kindle I just wish I could level up faster!
B00422LESO|3.0|I enjoyed this book as a welcome change from the action novels I have been reading of late. The story was not altogether predictable but touched the romantic in me. Trying to discover which of the characters were actors or not was interesting and discovering their underlying stories equally so. I am not usually a romantic novel fan but chose this one with a clever premise and fantasy to it. A good light escape read.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|I can't remember the last time I was so excited about the release of a worship project! Revealing Jesus is, without a doubt, my favorite worship release of the year and one of the top ten best of the past decade.<br /><br />My only complaint is perhaps the project's greatest compliment--what was recorded on the album was simply not enough! I loved every moment of the recording - and found myself wanting more. The Presence of God captured on that powerful night of worship (at Church of the Highlands in Birmingham, AL featuring guests such as Michael W. Smith, Israel Houghton, and Kari Jobe) is so strong on the songs that I fully expect to hear testimonies of signs and wonders taking place as a result of congregations singing these heaven-sent anthems.<br /><br />Since 1999, Darlene Zschech has not only been a personal hero for me in ministry, but she has been a voice that has rallied a generation to passionately pursue God's Presence at any cost. Her songs are the outflow of a true lifestyle of worship. It's not a job for her. Never has been. Even though she is one of the most professional of the professional when it comes to contemporary Gospel recording artists, I have personally sat under her ministry on several occasions, both in Australia and in the United States - she is so much more than a great musician. I can say with great conviction and absolute confidence that, more than a worship leader and more than a recording artist and more than a songwriter, Darlene Zschech is a firebrand and revivalist. She is one of God's burning torches that has set generations and geographies on fire for Jesus. More than perhaps any other project she has previously recorded, or contributed to, Revealing Jesus reveals the heart of a revivalist desperate to see people encounter the Living, supernatural Christ in the place of worship.<br /><br />\\"Victor's Crown\\" is not only the standout track on the album; I believe it is a \\"Shout to the Lord\\" for this new generation. The song actually carries a rare two-fold anointing, bringing people into a glorious, expressive exaltation of Jesus, the One Who overcame the world, and then, releases a stirring decree of spiritual warfare: \\"Every high thing must come down, every stronghold shall be broken.\\" The first time I heard the song was Darlene leading it at a Joyce Meyer conference. The place was electric with the Presence of God. People made the song their own. Joyce herself was actually staggering in God's glory! It is one of those songs that carries something special.<br /><br />\\"In Jesus' Name\\" is similar, as it is once again a powerful tool for warfare. More than a worshipful anthem, it is a boisterous declaration of praise. In both of these songs, Zschech manages to balance both Christ-centric worship and authoritative announcements of conquest, warfare, and victory. The bridge truly takes praise to a whole other level - \\"God is fighting for us, pushing back the darkness, lighting up the Kingdom that cannot be shaken. In the Name of Jesus, the enemy's defeated. And we will shout it out, shout it out!\\" The build and momentum is powerful.<br /><br />\\"God is Here\\" is a great opener and will serve many congregations as one of those rare \\"praise finds.\\" (Well-written up-tempo songs are a rarity these days). More than getting people on their feet and clapping, it actually puts some prophetic words in our mouths: \\"Open the gates Lord, reveal Your glory. Open the nations, establish Your Kingdom. Open the heavens, pour out Your Spirit. Jesus be revealed, Jesus be revealed!\\"<br /><br />Every song is worthwhile and stunning in its own unique way. Kari Jobe leads Zschech's \\"Yours Forever\\" (which you may remember from her previous studio album, You Are Love); \\"I Am Yours\\" - particularly the DVD version - is another highlight, with Michael W. Smith in the background; \\"Your Name/Cry of the Broken\\" is a great coupling of Paul Baloche's popular anthem with a song that carries deep significance to Zschech. And ofcourse, there are the two Israel Houghton songs that Darlene absolutely rocks - \\"Jesus At the Center\\" and \\"Your Presence is Heaven.\\"<br /><br />The DVD features a very special segment - that will have great sentimental value for those of us who grew up with Zschech. Darlene and Michael W. Smith lead \\"Shout to the Lord\\" and \\"Agnus Dei.\\" Once again, songs that were born in heaven and simply stewarded on Earth as the ears of God's intimates captured the words and melodies.<br /><br />I encourage you to go for the entire experience: CD, DVD, and the 365-Day devotional that Darlene wrote to accompany the project. You will truly encounter the presence and power of Jesus!
006226303X|2.0|I had read something else by Neil Gaiman, and I didn't like that, either, so I don't know why I ordered this one.  I'm sure others, needing less &#34;reality&#34; than I, will enjoy it.  This type of reading is just not for me.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Awesome on almost all fronts.  This is one of the better games you can find to entertain yourself.  Let the missiles fly straight and on target.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great music and what talent!!!  A must have. We have seen several of the videos and now have it on all our devices.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset has alot of cool features.<br /><br />The mute and volume control on the ear of the headset itself are very convenient and i use them frequently when someone talks to me nearby. Although this headset is wireless there is no discernible time lag between input or output when compared to a wired headset.<br /><br />On the other side, the sound quality is not quite as good as i was hoping, certainly not as good as the Siberia V2s that they replaced(One ear stopped working, probably because of me rolling over the wires and causing the wires to get pulled on). It also seems to have some issues with VoIP clients like mumble where sometimes sound will only play out of the right ear and a quick restart will fix the issue.<br /><br />Overall a solid headset that i can definitely reccomend.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Loved the movie and had to have the soundtrack! The actors actually sound pretty good with their versions of the songs!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|if you are a reader that craves action and has some spare time this is a great book for you. i thought it was great.

B008K9SG9K|4.0|I will play Radioactive over and over and over.  There's a reason it has become such a popular song in moves and TV shows.  Other songs live up to it as well.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Hilariously funny!!! I found myself feeling Emma's heartache and laughing out loud at many of her random thoughts, actions, and unfortunate events! Secrets...some things should be shared while others do not need to be mentioned. LOL!
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Love them.  I think that each album gets better than the last!  Such powerful vocals along with sweeping melodies in this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Can't believe what an incredible product this is for the price. Setup takes a just a couple minutes, and will require a computer connected to your WIRELESS network.  For instance, I didn't have my laptop at home when I initially received my Chromecast, and since my desktop only had a hard-wired connection, I was not able to use it to setup and configure my Chromecast.<br /><br />Other than that little hiccup, everything has been performing well above my expectations. I am shocked at how responsive the device is, and things are only getting better with the feature set of the device, as more and more app move to support Chromecast. This is a no-brainer.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This has been one of the best majong games we have played. Lots of combinations and new games  have downloaded other majong games but this is our favorite!!
B008MVPCL6|4.0|I like the sports style croc much better than the original. I work outdoors and need something with a thicker sole and these should last a lot longer. They also aren't as slick when walking on concrete.
B00338QENI|5.0|I initially chose to read this book when I saw the passion when my teenage daughter read it for an honors Biology assignment.  I wanted to know what had her so enthralled!  It took me reading only a few pages to have the same drive to read and learn more.  The author's style of transitioning from her own experience, to Henrietta's story, to the family and friends, to the medical and scientific facts would seem almost dizzying, but it was done in a way that told the complete story from many sides.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but , it was funny looking at how hard these guys aged. And they just keep popping up thru the whole movie.

B00CU9LHY2|4.0|A must have for any Pumpkins fan of the Mellon Collie era!<br />This reissue truly caps off the Pumpkins musical effort while they were at the top of the music world with the original four band members. The live CD &#34;Inside the Dark Globe&#34; is especially good - well recorded & mixed.<br />I imagine that once all the reissues have surfaced there wont be a single track the Pumpkins have recorded that wont have seen the light of day.

B0036JU6CY|4.0|After seeing Rain's performances as a singer/dancer and actor  in Korean dramas, I was impressed with his task committment. He always gives 100%.  The months of training that he endured to prepare for this role shows his dedication to his craft.  I thought his performance was outstanding.  I realize that this movie was made for the American market, so it was in English, not his native language.  His English continually improves with every project.  I would have probably given it 5 stars if it were in Korean.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I Like it because it has so Many words and pretty Good definitions Too. I mean Most dictionaries have Holly words tagt we use really offen. Words that they think are normal. When in truth, they are words that we never even use. So it can be helpfull a game it anything Really.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|My daughter has several of these type of games, where you can do hair, etc. There are only a few color options available for free, so that limits the game, and it's not one to hold her attention for very long, but she enjoys it.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth and Joe doing blues is absolutely amazing. There is no filler on this CD. I have never heard a better version of &#34;I Rather Be Blind&#34; or of &#34;Ain't No Way&#34;. I would love to see them do another just blues.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really shouldn't have given any stars as my grandson is the one that bought this game.  They tried to teach me how to do it-went so-so.  The boys seemed to enjoy playing this game and kept them busy for awhile, so that made it a good game for me.  judiquilts
0596805527|4.0|As the subtitle indicates, this work is definitive. Be prepared to find yourself sinking or swimming right from the start, as the material gets technical from page viii and never looks back. Be advised: Flanagan is not a flowery, anecdotal writer. But he appears to be thorough. Stick with it. The payoff is enormous, as obscure concepts (for a newbie like me) discussed in the first hundred pages or so are clarified satisfactorily later on. This is not only a book about JavaScript, but also a commentary on how programming (and its language component) as a concept has evolved in reaction and relation to the internet. Coming from a Visual Basic, standalone executable perspective, I found this approach very helpful in augmenting my knowledge base.<br /><br />Programming fundamentals from a JavaScript perspective are carefully explained, although some patience may be required from the reader, especially if they have little or no exposure to the C-family language. Again, stick with it; Flanagan delivers on that subtitle. And despite the claim that JavaScript, by its nature, might forever defy a true reference, there's one in here, and that was one of the reasons I decided to buy this book. In fact, there are several references inside, covering both client-side and server-side JavaScript components. Very handy. There's even a chapter on jQuery, comprehensive enough to be its own book (see: jQuery, the Pocket Reference, also by Flanagan).<br /><br />Occasionally I struggle with some of the material presented, but I'm guessing that's because of my lack of exposure to anything C++, rather than the author's approach/delivery. In fact, Flanagan seems to anticipate a little struggling with concepts, and frequently (enough) slows the pace down so that dinosaurs like me can stay caught up, focused, and moving forward.<br /><br />This might be a 5-starred book, but since I haven't finished it in the 30 days since purchase, it gets stuck with 4 stars for now. Nonetheless, one might ask: is David Flanagan the NEW Danny Goodman?? BUY RECOMMENDATIONsk: is David Flanagan the NEW Danny Goodman?? BUY RECOMMENDATION
B005544TRQ|4.0|Dialogue and casting are superb! Good music. Wonderful writing. Great chemistry among the characters! Looking forward to next season's shenanigans!
0345525558|5.0|I found the book a little depressing at first but quickly got so into it I couldn't put it down!  We discussed it at my book club,<br />everybody enjoyed the book!!
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These headphones are great!  Fantastic definition, they are also some of the most comfortable phones I've ever worn.  The ear cups are big enough for my ears to fit happily inside giving them some very solid noise cancellation.
0385347774|4.0|When I began reading this book, I found it a little slow.  It still kept my interest & by the second part of the book, I couldn't put it down!!  Very strange twists (initially, I thought it would be predictable).  I have already recommended the book to my friends.
B00004U8P9|5.0|But it is certainly for me. It is one of my two favorite moves. The Haunting is the other.  The commentaries are amazing, but I wish Tim talked about his take on the production.
B00AF82WTO|3.0|I read the book many a times over and over again. Youtube editing of this particular BBC adaptation made it a convincing 'Persuasion' plot for me for a while till i got a hold of the DVD. Frankly, the roles of both the actors are not that good enough to make me fall in love with them. I saw the North and South BBC adaptation- and man, oh man, it just blew me away! While Wentworth here looks like somewhat detached and Anne looks like she is die- hard trying to capture his attention..... but fails! The storyline's a bit out of the text and is not well put! Over all, an okay delivery but this being not a very pleasant version makes me want to make buy the other version of Persuasion- Hinds... at least he looks convincing enough to be the proud and a heart- broken man who is and always was head over heels in love with the pretty Anne. Wonder why i didn't buy this Hinds persuasive performance in the first place!
B000FA6720|2.0|The Bridges of Madison County by Robert James Waller is a love story, between a single man Robert Kincaid and a married woman Francesca Johnson that takes place within a total of four days. I am not a fan of love stories; though, I decided to give this book an honest chance due to its popularity. It took me three weeks to finish. I found it be unrealistic and \\"corny\\"; however, I liked that the author gave the main characters mature ages vs. the typical young adult ages in love stories. Overall, I am disappointed.
B000JO9JHW|3.0|Too loose to compare with top series.  Premise imteresting but execution is sloppy.  Not enough believable continuity.  Only watched 4 episodes
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Addictive though patience is key.  A bit difficult for beginners but will have you  coming back. Fun game. Speed is key.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As I said its an awesome little dongle for a rock bottom price. A win for google. The beta browser is great as well.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|so far so good.  watch looks good and runs good. and I don't even have to put a battery in it.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|I Became a huge fan of this author after \\"The Luck of The Weissensteiners\\" and couldn't wait to jump into Sebastian (The Three Nations Trilogy). I was at first surprised that this book goes back to WWI, (Luck of the Weissensteiners takes place around WWII). However, themes tie the books together, namely the consequences of war, the effect of a single decision or event on the entire life of an individual and a family. Fischer's characters continue to amaze me. They are so true and complex that when I took a break from the book it felt as though they were in the next room. This evening, I caught myself thinking about the character Sebastian like an old friend. This is an eloquently written, character driven novel, beautifully woven with rich historical details. This is an author to not only watch, but one to admire for how he can tell a story with such inspiring authenticity. Highly recommended.
B0054EU0H0|5.0|So far it has worked perfectly.  With some attention to detail it fit perfectly on my D3200, and it has not slid or peeled at all.<br /><br />No need to replace it yet, but I do have the second film still in the package just incase
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This dvd is one of the best movies he has ever made. I'm so glad I was able to purchase it. A must have for his fans.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Story line was impossible to follow. The two women thing made no sense. The sound was so loud (sometimes) and so soft othertimes (dialog).  I was constantly changing the volumn. Tom Cruise should give it up.  He just cannot act anymore.  I could go on, but it was truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  My wife starting reading her book during the movie.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It does what I need it to do and was decently priced. It's nice to have as an extra for the car or travel.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|nice speed game. its get you keep playing. A plus. basic but really entretaining. game to spend a lot of time plying with.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|I love the series and this is the only way to really understand it. There are so many interlocking plots and details, that the airing alone cannot show it all. Being able to watch and review is the way I finally understood it.<br />Great collection.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|goes back over the same material too often. Shows little proof of the narrative. Seems to display a Muslim based bias.

B004N622EY|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has created a fantastic universe and a brilliant series! A marvellous read and a beginning to a great trilogy!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So glad that I was able to get in on the deal with 3 free months of Netflix streaming.  Made the purchase a no brainer.  Already had Netflix streaming through our Blu-Ray player, but the ease of use is so much better with this.  My kids use the tablet to control it when they want to watch cartoons and they have no problems doing that.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Such a wonderful story.  Made me laugh and cry at the same time.  Highly recommend it.
B0000AKCLS|3.0|Some you like more than others, I don't hate it but I don't love it either, a nice change of pace.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|I thought this book was very detailed and gave great information about North Korea that isn't usually shared. Easy read!

0307279189|5.0|It made me change my shoes.  It makes me want to change my diet.  It was a fascinating and well told story.  On top of that, the bio-mechanical explanations were fascinating and really clearly broken down.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Why doesn't Hollywood remake films like this? Oh, it's because it's based on a book that is in contrast to it's Socialist Agenda....too bad. IF only the John Q. Public could see this film in Modern context., he might have a different view of the world.

B0053KWDES|5.0|It is truly amazing that this little portable amp can bring out the best in headphones. As soon as I plugged it in to my dt880's the sound became fuller and more immersive. The only negative I have to say is I got cheap and didn't order the package with the extra battery and charger as I never want to be without this little amp. However, luckily it takes a very common and inexpensive battery and charger which I ordered.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great movie, really enjoyed it.  Makes you think. Tom Cruise is always fantastic in any role. If you liked Tron you'll like this.

B00CZAYL76|5.0|Every album has been great, but this one steps it up a notch with a lot of amazing collaborations. Can't stop listening to it
B005I4JG80|3.0|I read about this book in a newspaper a few years ago, and since friends of mine were about to have their first child, I purchased this book for them as a gift. I decided to read it myself, because I am fascinated by cultures anyway. I found it to be very informative for a new parent interested in trying something new, and culturally informative for a bachelor like myself. When I have children I will try and conjure my inner Frenchman.<br /><br />The resource material for the book seems more interesting than this book. I would like to read the source books that the author quotes.<br /><br />Long story short. Very fun, not too long, and at bare minimum, practical parenting advice.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|if you're looking at this title, you are no doubt experienced with this, somewhat, and wonder if it's THAT much better on Blu-ray (given you have a nice-sized LCD/LED screen,) and to that, I can tell you it's immensely beautiful.<br /><br />However, a caution:<br /><br />If you have a PS3, you will experience lock-ups on the disc, and you will find little solutions and support online.<br /><br />If you haven't formatted it in a while, many programs, save files, and such can affect certain Blu-ray playing. Clearing caches, and individual files may or may not work, but a full format WILL.<br /><br />Please consider the trouble and willingness to do so, if you have a PS3 and such problems. There are dozens on 'non-formatting' solutions, and most will not work in your case.<br /><br />So, be prepared. Save your files, prepare for the good possibility of having to re-format.<br /><br />Is it worth it?<br /><br />Yes. it absolutely is.
B00DULWFZE|5.0|I'm so glad BSB are out with a new album. I love it! They completed this album 100% on their own. Very impressive :)
B00ALGW286|5.0|I picked up Dr. Julia Gousseva's \\"Moscow Dreams\\" to have a nice Sunday read. The book was about Moscow and how it transitioned from communism to democracy.<br /><br />I expected a heavy and gloomy tone.  Then I realized the book was actually a coming-of-age novel and it's a coming-of-age novel at very special time.  It was at the Moscow at 1991. Right when Yeltsin has consolidated his presidency after elected.  For the uninitiated, living in a communist regime is very different from our lives in United States: you might need to join the communist party to excel in school or choose career choice you like.<br /><br />Imagine you are a high-school girl, Marina, and your career in high-school has followed the party's instruction.  But the government has suddenly changed and all you worked in your life can be in vain. What would you do?  How would that affect your life, your friendship and your relationship?  Those are questions I keep on asking myself while I was reading.<br /><br />Another part I like about \\"Moscow Dreams\\" is that it is not over-sensational as you would expect in many literatures about different communist regimes in the world.  It has a light mood and a good ending for characters you love. Dr. Gousseva, who has a Master of English Language and Linguistic and a PhD of Second Language Acquistion, tells a beautiful story in a voice unique to her background: She was also a Russian immigrant who lived in Moscow in 1991.<br /><br />All-in-all, I love this book and give it 5 star.  To quote George R. R. Martin, \\"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. \\"  I am glad that I live Marina's high school' life. Thanks to \\"Moscow Dream\\".
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Pleasantly surprised. This has turned out to be one of my favorite listens. Great for when I am cooking dinner, or sitting and paying bills. Not in your face. Grandson says it fits my mood.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Pretty nicely designed. User submitted additions make the accuracy and speed of the narrowing down of your chosen person or character astonishing and fun.
B004HD61KE|4.0|It was quite good, but I wouldn't say excellent. A good read and I would consider reading more from this author.
B00DIDORH8|2.0|I had read the description and it had never said there was only 2 discs in the box. Even if it had said 2 discs I would have expected still 4 movies. The box says 4 film favorites, Batman Collection. Please sale what you advertise
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is fun game. I love completing collections and helping friends complete their collections. I also like the free play daily bingo game.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|The autoplay option makes playing the game smooth and fun. I can just relax and enjoy the challenge. I definitely think it was worth the 99 coins. Just touch the card you want to move and watch the game place it where it belongs!
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I saw the original with William Campbell many years ago and was wanting to see how the newer version would hold up! It was even more better of course as we have much more advances in movie making now and would reccomend this to any Horror fan Buffs!

B000AU9UYC|5.0|This is a great Movie. I bought it as a gift for a friend. I would recommend it to anyone. I even bought one for my self!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Received it Friday.  Plugged it into the TV, configured it for my network and started streaming YouTube and Netflix.  Watched about 4 hours Friday night and several more over the weekend.  It does what it's supposed to do and what Google says it will do.  I'm hoping there will be more services getting on board with the Chromecast.  I'll order 2 more for the rest of the TVs in my house.
0425267695|2.0|Unfortunately, this novel was not good, at least the first 100 pages that I read, and yes, you can tell if a novel, especially in the fantasy department, will be excellent in the first 1/4 of the book.  I admit, I got completely sucked in by all of the positive reviews here on Amazon, and I should have known, because the last time I got duped was with Wool, by Hugh Howey, another mediocre if best, novel that has thousands of 5 star ratings.  Perhaps I am spoiled by fantasy novels such as Tigana, The Name of the Wind, Game of Thrones, The Way of Kings, etc.,  these are top notch classic fantasy novels.  My problem with Blood Song is its linearity, the book is very shallow, there are no intertwining story lines to keep you guessing.  In other words, the story is straight up spoon fed to you.  There is no mystery.  The author tells, but he does not show, and that is the cheapest thing a novelist can do.  It is almost insulting.  Don't fall for the hype.  Martin, Erikson, Sanderson, Kavriel, etc., THOSE guys are the masters, Ryan doesn't, and never will hold a candle to them.  I gave this novel 2 stars just for the fact that it was written, and I returned it after reading the first 100 pages, I never do that.
B000ZOSMTW|3.0|I bought this product as a gift. The recipient seem to love it so all it was worth the purchase.
B00846REIS|1.0|Wish I had read some of the reviews before purchasing this book...a total waste of money.  I quit reading and donated the book about a third of the way in.  It takes more than hot sex between flawless people to hold my interest.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Wow, I never use the word captivating. But I feel that this novel was captivating, at least for me. Part of it was that I hadn't read anything really well-written for quite a while. Also that I tend to really love Richard Ford's writing and storytelling. I knew at the outset this novel hadn't gotten the best reviews, compared with some of his other work. (He did win the Pulitzer and the Pen/Faulkner Award for Independence Day.) But, as I said, I had been reading a lot of run-of-the-mill stuff (except for a collection of stories by Alice Munro) so I was eager for some good writing.<br /><br />I was captivated in that I totally bought into the narrator's persona. The story is told by and revolves around a young boy, about 12 or 13, whose parents commit a robbery and go to jail, leaving him and his twin sister more or less in the lurch. More or less because his mother had arranged for a friend to come and take them away somewhere to ensure they didn't end up in a &#34;home.&#34; The setting is Montana in the 50s, but naturally (look at the title) the setting changes to Canada. Either place is bleak and cheerless. The boy has to navigate any number of challenges, much like a hero in a myth, simply to survive and come to some understanding of who he is. The challenges are physical and environmental, but also emotional and intellectual as he struggles to accommodate, please, avoid, handle, and comprehend the adults in his life. These adults have enigmatic, eccentric, and baffling characteristics; and that goes for his own parents, with whom he obviously feels the most comfortable. But he continues to try to unravel the meaning and intentions behind his parents' actions and the paths they took.<br /><br />I imagine some people might find this book a bit boring. The bank robbery and some murders are announced in the first sentence. From there, the narrator goes on about his parents and their actions leading up to and shortly after the robbery for a good part of the book. It's very day-to-day. But it captivated me in that I was invested in the boy's search for understanding, or at least for some sort of satisfaction in the retelling of his story. There's almost a memoir-ish feel to this novel. But its plain-spoken telling renders it gritty and chilling. It's easy enough to see how a childhood can be compromised by the actions of adults, and how teenaged twins could end up miles and years apart, practically broken by an ill-conceived plan that was meant to save their family.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book made me feel as if I were right there, suffering the events with the characters.  Very real and full of suspense to the very end.  Great Read!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The way the story was interwoven through each person's retelling of the zombie war was really riveting and well done.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Very well done graphics, immediately addicting for me. I haven't played any other boxing games on my Kindle so I'm sure there is one others would say is better but I love the novelty of the Monkey Boxing and the cute/cool outfits you earn. I haven't had any loading issues and there doesn't seem to be in games purchases so I recommend it for sure.<br /><br />I got it FAOTD but it is one I'd pay for now that I've tried it :)~
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's a young adult book, but a very fun read and it totally got me additced to the whole series.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|EXCELLENT book in every sense of the word.  Well written and mesmerizing to read.  It's a hard book to put down.  It restores your faith in mankind.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|The only personal information this app asks for is to read and write to my bookmarks.  The only thing that confuses me is why there is a blue and a red one.  The apps are named the same and seem exactly the same from the description.
B00DJYK9ZU|4.0|CD with deluxe packaging is great, but I'm mad about the price increase! It was 9.99 when i put it in my cart yesterday, and before I could buy it, it went up! That's not fair, Amazon.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does what I expected and a great price, Very straight forward piece of technology. Another step away from being connected to cable. KISS formula
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Use this notepad to keep notes and reminders. Great app and if you do not like it you can easily uninstall.
0062255657|4.0|I might have been biased by the fact that I prefer long novels, but I couldn't quite get over the fact that this was such a short novel. In addition, I thought it was barely an adult novel, really still basically a children's novel. That said, the story was well written and wonderful, and my problems with it were more based on how it was presented rather than the story itself.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun. The graphics are realistic and it helps you threw any questions you might have.
0307951529|4.0|This is one of those things where its interesting to read, but I find myself half wondering 'who is this guy anyways and why do I care what he has to say.'  Obviously he does have some background and has found success, but I wonder whether or not that was more luck than skill.  That being said, I thought that the book was interesting to read and there are lots of great anecdotes.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|The CD is absolutely great.  I know the song &#34;Music&#34; by John Miles  from many years ago and always loved it.  David Garrett did a wonderful version of it!  All the other songs are great as well.  DG is an amazing artist!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book follows the same story as the other two with predictable twos s and turns.....another book wasn't necessary but it was still entertaining
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I love my talking Tom cat. My son has it & i found it very funny. Lots of laughs & lots of fun!
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is great app, u don't think I can function without<br />It. I would have given 7 star, if there is something like 7 stsrs. Good job to those who discovered this app.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Hot Fuzz is simply one of the best comedies of all time, in that, it's comedy is just so dry, smart, and sharp. I love it!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm a huge fan of epic fantasy, but my standards for quality writing are pretty high. I don't like predictability in plotline, don't like hoaky magic systems, and am completely adverse to infallible protagonists. In The Way of Kings, Sanderson has given me all I crave from this genre: compelling characters, deep and mysterious magic systems, large over-arching story, and lots of warfare - both political and military. This promises to be one of the greatest works of fantasy in my library.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have not, in the past, been a reader of this particulasr type of writing. I ordered this book for the book club and was only reading the book for that purpose, however, since the beginning I have been GLUED to this book and all of the juicy dialogue this book contains. I love, love, love that this book is written from both perspectives at the same time. It gives the reader the ability to stay abreast of the story without having to  remember what happened too long ago.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great, great, great book. Ryan's storytelling is top-notch, complete with dark mystery and gripping suspense. The stakes are high for all characters, and it becomes evident rather quickly that death is a price that many will pay for failure. The settings are also quite interesting, with unique world views and an interesting take on religion/magic/mysticism. Really enjoyed the first installment of what's sure to be a fantastic series.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good way to kill time?<br />Fairly simple game<br />Graphics are minimalistic<br />Controls are responsive<br />That is all I have to say
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It's rare to find a new author whose storytelling and characterization draws you in like Rothfuss has with The Kingkiller Chronicle. Really enjoyed this next installment - can't wait for the next.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I didn't realize this product was capable of also setting the TV to the right HDMI port, along with turning it on.  The result?  You can set something up to play on Chromecast, and the TV turns on along with setting itself to the right input.<br /><br />Pretty neat!
B0015AARJI|1.0|It doesn't hold a charge more that 15 minutes and even when sitting on the table untouched it is constantly trying to move cursor or directional joy stick up and to the left. Don't waste your time buying  it online, for the same price get it at walmart or some store where you can return the broken product and get a good one the same day.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I paid a dollar for this app and I got 3 characters, 6 levels, and 8 &#34; playgrounds. The rest cost money. Not for young children who would recklessly buy everything. The full app would cost about $7. This app is a total rip off!
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|This little baby plugged into my ASUS F2A85-V Pro mainboard along with the Samsung 250GB SSD and Kingston Hyper Beast 16GB memory made my newly built PC a work of art. I've used AMD for many years, and in my opinion, it's the best buy for the money. A solid APU.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|With hundreds of levels from easy enough to a 7-year-old to hard enough to challenge an adult, flow free gives lots of game-play at absolutely no cost! Although there is an option to buy hints, there are no flashy advertisements in the center of the screen, just a small button in the corner. A great mind puzzle!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Can't get enough of this game.<br />Love the slots when they were all priced the same,now some are more which is a major bummer.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I didn't start watching this series until this year.  I needed to catch up on previous episodes.  Pretty nice collectors item.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun. And amusing. I love the minions and Despicable Me. So this is a spectacular game. I am 14 and love it. Great game for all ages and the whole family.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I didn't start watching this show until this year. I needed to catch up on past episodes.  Very good quality
B00B3YLI8U|3.0|Pharsing in a lot of areas of the plot was dated, too much detail on some trival items and then no back ground info written in on some key areas like how did the &#34;Women In White&#34; and her close friend pay for all the moves they made and travel.  Not detail, just broad brush statements filling in voids.  How did a marriage take place when allegedly the wife was listed as dead at the time of the marriage.  Book worth reading since the descriptions of events and people described was based on life style in the era wrtten and this made the story interesting.  .
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The series is ending this year and I needed to catch up on previous episodes.  Many of my family members are not aware of this series.  Its fun to watch the episodes with  them
B00CFA222M|4.0|Nicholas Hoult and Eleanor Tomlinson play the peasant villager (Jack) and the princess (Isabelle) who must stop a villainous Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci) in a dastardly plan to use the Giants of olde to bring him to power.  Ewan MacGregor plays the loyal and brave Elmont, a knight to King Bramwell (Ian McShane) who aids them in the battle that ensues.  This is a good old-fashioned fairy tale with bravery, humor, villains, magic, love and plenty of action.  Sit down and spend a good time watching a great fantasy action/adventure film.
B009SJ46EA|1.0|What's even more disturbing than this show is the fact that so many people find it so wonderful! I did not think \\"American Horror Story\\" could possibly sink any lower than it did during the first season. (refer to my review of season one) I tried watching it during its second season just to see if anything had changed and I was horrified to discover that it is even more vulgar and depraved. This season we see a man having sexual intercourse with a dead woman's body- wow, what a great way to spend your tv-watching hours! At the risk of offending this show's die-hard fans who will no doubt respond to my review with their own defensive criticism, I just felt compelled to express my feelings toward this disgusting show. I know that everyone has their own opinions and those opinions should be expected and respected but I think this show is degrading and offensive. The fact that people actually ENJOY watching it baffles me. I know- if I don't like it I don't have to watch it. And I don't plan to watch it. I just wanted to provide some realistic feedback here.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|...what do you expect with $35 bucks?<br /><br />What you need to know:<br />- has to be plug into an outlet (comes with a cord).<br />- works with chrome......anything outside of that, that is another story!<br /><br />Couldn't get my XMBC to stream...
0385535147|5.0|I've read everything he's ever written and there's never been one I didn't think was great! Grisham is in that rare class with 4 or 5 others (Sanford, Connelly, Child, DeMille, Follett) who just never seem to write a bad sentence, let alone a whole book.BUT DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE PATTERSON DID AND 'CO-AUTHOR&#34; WITH ANOTHER WRITER. It takes away the authentisity of the writing and doesn't give your valued readers full value for their buck..........
0307474259|5.0|I am so happy to finally have information that is correct instead of all the &#34;studies&#34; that have hand picked subjects.  When I need help staying on the correct path. I read this book over.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Pretty cool stuff that I am looking forward to using. The only one that I have a lot of people who I have to tell them about this app.
B000001EKX|5.0|The second LP by KISS (\\"Hotter than hell\\") was released in Fall, on October 22, 1974. Making the music for this album the KISS musicians were looking for heavier sound. Despite their debut, self-titled LP was successful, the music was not as tough as they wanted. As regards the artistic value \\"Hotter than hell\\" was comparable to the first album. The fans were satisfied with it. Moreover, that time  KISS were also famous for their special live performances. They were also invited to take part in TV shows. All that things mentioned caused KISS to grow in popularity. They became rock stars who got accustomed to the rock 'n'roll lifestyle.<br />KISS decided to visit Los Angeles' Village Recorder to make \\"Hotter than hell\\". They made quite a long way from home city (New York) to achieve their goal.<br />It is not easy to select the best tracks from this LP as the music does not need any recommendation.<br />Paul Stanley wrote three tough and smashing songs (\\"Got to choose\\", \\"Hotter than hell\\" and \\"Mainline\\"). Gene Simmons introduced a few rather short but sweet tracks (\\"All the way\\" and \\"Watchin' you\\"). Ace Frehley was the author of another two songs (\\"Parasite\\", \\"Strange ways\\"). Both could have been recognized as the pure, heavy sound the band was searching for some time.<br />\\"Comin' home\\" - the only song by Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley here - actually<br />paid tribute to their home city (NYC). It should be said that the KISS musicians left their home city and were headed for Los Angeles in order to work on the new material for \\"Hotter than hell\\". The remaining pair of tracks (\\"Goin' blind\\" and Let me go, rock 'n' roll) were on a parallel with the rest. Gene Simmons and Stephen Coronel created the former. The latter was composed by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Both songs met the expectations of the most demanding fans and critics.<br />The lyrics of \\"Hotter than hell\\" center around the following topics:<br />- romantic attraction, lust, strong sex drive, sexual obsession, sexy appearance, adultery (\\"Got to choose\\", \\"Parasite\\", \\"Hotter than hell\\", \\"Watchin' you\\");<br />- communication between spouses or partners (\\"Strange ways\\", \\"All the way\\");<br />- the effects of aging (\\"Goin' blind\\");<br />- drug dependence (\\"Mainline\\");<br />- several aspects of rock 'n' roll's impact on teenagers and adults (\\"Let me go, rock 'n' roll\\");<br />- the magical city of New York (\\"Comin' home\\").<br />Even though we could listen to the remastered version, a disadvantage of the production is the quality of sound. In my opinion, it could be a little bit higher. But we should remember that in the early 70s. the technology suffered from many serious limitations as compared with the opportunites we are given today.ssion, sexy appearance, adultery (\\"Got to choose\\", \\"Parasite\\", \\"Hotter than hell\\", \\"Watchin' you\\");<br />- communication between spouses or partners (\\"Strange ways\\", \\"All the way\\");<br />- the effects of aging (\\"Goin' blind\\");<br />- drug dependence (\\"Mainline\\");<br />- several aspects of rock 'n' roll's impact on teenagers and adults (\\"Let me go, rock 'n' roll\\");<br />- the magical city of New York (\\"Comin' home\\").<br />Even though we could listen to the remastered version, a disadvantage of the production is the quality of sound.

140006922X|5.0|Zealot contains excellent and thorough research, provocative questions and answers from the author, guaranteed to engender reactions from readers.  His major thesis that Jesus was a political Jew talking to other Jews about throwing off the Roman yoke rather than a quiet man of love and peace as well as the author's debunking of a virgin birth in Bethlehem as opposed to his family's home of Nazareth will anger many conservative Christians, but will provoke thought from others.  Unfortunately, many attack the author because he is a Muslim, but his use of many academic sources demonstrates to me that his opinions are based on at least two centuries of biblical criticism rather than only his opinion.  Certainly some of his statements are based on his own assumptions, but that is what scholars do.  On the whole, I found his information about the political, social, and economic situation in first century Palestine to be the most useful material in the book.  That helped me better understand the situation that Jesus and his followers found themselves in at that time.  I would hope that other readers also find that material informative.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|this is a dumb game no instructions and not any fun. was glad i got it off my kindle. you may like it but this old guy does not. may the force be with you.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game. Lots of levels and awards to achieve, pictures to restore. You recieve money and crystals to use to buy energy. It's not a typical hidden object game, lots more to do and very enjoyable.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Was fairly good movie, but it was Tom Cruise. I really mean Tom Cruise. Wish he would go back to making movies and not so much Tom Cruise. If it was not for Morgan Freedman I don't think I would have bought it. It was just to much Tom Cruise and his scientology.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Thought they were enjoyable reads.  I'm looking forward for the fourth of five.  Jeffrey has a knack of good storytelling that is not to flowery and easy to follow.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Make sure you keep it clean! I would also suggest having an air pump handy so you do not faint from excessive air exhaustion. Blew it up in 10 secs.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|It has worked well.  The headset has a proprietary charging interface, which gravity tends to disconnect.  This has resolved this.  I get about 2-3 charges before I have to recharge the charger.  I have found 2 times it has left my headset dead, so I'm assuming when the charger goes dead it takes the headset with it.<br /><br />Makes for a nice place to stick my headset when boarding a plane, I don't have to spend as much time looking for it when I land.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not typically a YA reader, but I absolutely loved John Green's The Fault in Our Stars. Yes, I was that blubbering woman who stayed up until midnight to finish the story. Excellent character development with heart-wrenching insights made this book hard to put down. As a early thirty-something, I could relate to the coming-of-age story, as well as, the parental perspective of having a child with cancer. Intimate, truthful journey that I thoroughly enjoyed. I highly recommend.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Held me captive. Simple but so good!!  I read it too quickly but I couldn't help it! I could see and feel all of the characters.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Much has been said already about this concert in the comments section, but I have to reiterate that Madonna is the Ultimate and NO ONE  puts on a show like this woman. Not to be confused with a typical rock concert, Madonna always presents her work as a performance piece and each time it gets better and better. Truly the best live performer of our time.
B002KKCVVO|4.0|This is at least the third pair of this Teva design (names change but it's the same old sandal.). I ordered my current size, 11, and the sizing is perfect. I think the straps will wear better; they previous cosmetic fabric frayed quite a bit. I like the pull strap at the heel. It's obviously too early to tell how they'll hold up but they look well made. The only problem I've ever had was a sole that separated on a pair a couple of generations back. I glued them on with a flexible cement and they lasted a couple of more years of heavy wear.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is one of the best sci fi series out there. Every single novel and novella in the series is better than the next. Nalini created an amazing universe of different species that is unique to her. I highly recommend the series.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|As an IT professional I found the book very realistic and engaging. It is an IT thriller for the general public.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|SciFi fluff.  Well shot and good effects. But nothing groundbreaking.  Good way to kill and evening. Tom Cruise was his usual character.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I have enjoyed Daniel Radcliffe in everything that he has done.  This was scary without being grotesque with unnecessary blood and gore.
B00190OHD6|3.0|The storyline was fine.  There were some elements in it that I just felt strange about.  I didn't feel the love between them as much.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Awesome App!!!! I love it. I use this app daily. It works perfectly. :) So far I have had no issues with the app freezing.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I loved the twists that this movie put on the well know fairytale.  It was a brand new story.  Loved It!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game.  Very addicting to play.  I find myself playing instead of doing other things.  It does freeze up on the kindle at times but still a great free app.
1881273873|5.0|love this book and doing the test on boy friends to see what love communicator they are and surprised myself as to how I communicate love, yet very true would recommend this book to everyone!!!
0061992860|5.0|Not only does this book cover the necessities, it also provides images that are crucial to good understanding. Also, the book is very small, so you can put it in your bugout bag without worry of weight or size. The perfect survival guide.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I think all who serve our Country are special men & women!!! Our son ,who is in the Air Force, recommended this book. He felt my husband the history buff would love it. He was right Ron couldn't put it down! He spoke about the book for days. To this day he makes reference to it. I'm going to read it when I get some time. But I would recommend it highly !!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Great casting, actors brought to life histories characters.  One of the best aspects was to see the humor side of Lincoln which many portrails do not show.  In addition to being entertained, I learned about some of the characters in congress at this time, and the negotiations that took place to amend the constitution and end slavery.  Daniel Day-Lewis again loses himself in the role of Lincoln and you do not feel you are watching an actor play a character, but feel as if you are seeing this president in person.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game could be as good as any of my PlayStation games, but I'm playing it on my kindle HD. I can't put it down ,haven't had to pay for anything yet without the game blaming out. This makes me want to spend some money just to advance. but still having fun without. Most free games you have too buy more to continue I delete this is I won't.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Very realistic story about how Detroit has changed racially, ethnically and economically and how a family patriarch resists these changes and then adjusts to them thanks to a lovely Asian girl and her brother.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I have not been so engrossed in a movie in a long time. Excellent acting!  Story line very sentimental if you ever owned an animal
B00007KLJJ|5.0|The Sudanese characters are treated with much more depth than the original fim..  There is more justification for their savagery.  British behavior is not always honorable, probably much more accurate.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Google Chromecast does what it is suppose to do.  I am able to view Netflix on my non-Wifi TV along with a few other Google apps and Chrome.  Chrome can be used via a desktop or laptop.  It is great.  I can not compare it to a streaming device because it does not have as many apps but it will do for now.  Hulu Plus has currently been added so this is a plus!!<br />I highly recommend this item. I really love the fact that I have received 3 months free of Netflix service.<br />I am very pleased with my purchase.  Make sure you update your Chromecast when it is available to keep the app running smoothly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|SO MUCH FUN! AND FREE! I find it a LoL creepy when logged into FB &amp; your friends' pics show up in the game but still fun otherwise.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|If you have a Plantronics Voyager Pro you know they are not exactly cheap and just having it in my purse along with a million other things I was always afraid that I was going to mess it up. This case takes care of that problem. I'm really glad I bought it.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It's funny and sweet I thought it would be funnier but I enjoyed it and it had a great ending I may watch it again
B009NY43NY|5.0|I will miss this series.  Always fun to read and always ends ways to soon.  I look forward to the next book which goes into the future of their lives.  Charlaine Harries delivers again!!!
1401937519|5.0|Anita's journey is fascinating and mind opening.  For those already consciously on the spiritual path, it is a great reminder and thought provoking.  For those just curious, it is an inspiring, interesting, and miraculous true story!  I highly recommend it.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I love this show its so blatantly funny. Definitely takes me back to my days in HS yes yes we all thought these things.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some of the escapes were difficult. Had a good time challenging friends to see who had the solution. Enjoyed playing, hoping for more levels soon.
B004132HZS|5.0|One must wonder why British television seasons are so short; this first set consists of all of three episodes. A terrific updating of the Sherlock Holmes tales sets the characters in the contemporary era, in a London filled with social media, cars, and the fast pace of life. It's a testament to the writing and casting that they fit so very well into current society. Benedict Cumberbatch is ideally cast as Holmes, playing him as brilliant but deranged, and oblivious to so much around him regardless. There's a deviousness in his take on the character that perfectly fits in with Sherlock. Martin Freeman is a well cast Watson, a former Army doctor brought into Holmes' orbit. He gives the role a complexity that suits it, as he tries to keep up with his counterpart. As with previous Watsons, Freeman is a good foil to Cumberbatch as Holmes. The two leads have a great rapport, and it makes the three episodes flow together nicely. Rupert Graves turns up as a contemporary inspector Lestrade, bothered by the fact that he must occasionally call in Holmes for help. Mark Gatiss, the show co-creator, turns up as Holmes' brother Mycroft, running British intelligence. And we even get a Moriarty in the shadows for good measure. A pleasure to watch, though you might want to use subtitles on this. Holmes tends to talk quickly.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great fix for my OCD &amp; neat-freak needs LOL Just the ticket when I need to put something on order on the world :)
B000PMG16U|5.0|Obviously awesome because it's Star Wars, and it's in blue ray.  I purchased this to just replace the regular dvd's I had that were not blue ray.  Price and shipping costs were good.
B00AEFXE3Q|5.0|It's a great time period for me.  Kate Hudson Should have won an Academy Award for her performance.  This extended version is even better than the original.
0307951529|2.0|The book is sort of misleading with the title, because it doesn't really tell you how to get started on a real business with little capital. A lot of the examples in the book deal with small time extra cash building operations and didn't seem like real scalable businesses or include several relevant details regarding how the businesses actually obtained sales etc. In terms of the advice offered, it was a rehash of generic entrepreneurship information that most people are aware of. What the book does do, is provide some motivation/self-help language that may aid a novice. Overall, while it is an easy read, it does not deliver on the premise.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I just got the Roku and I spent my weekends for the last 4 weeks watching this series.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't been an avid reader in quite awhile, but this one right here, this book, makes me want to find the gems out there. It's gleaming.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Seriously, favorite season hands down. ALL THE BROTHER FEELS!!!!  But in all seriousness, this is the best show in the world.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game to play before and after class. Fun, entertaining. I wish there were more trailers to watch and more things to build.
B000000992|4.0|Many comments on here about the vinyl muddiness that underpins this release, however i failed to hear any such flaw & instead found it a clear & defined record with the meatiest of bottom ends, bringing a smile to the face of this Tool fan.<br />The songs we all know, but on vinyl this album comes alive & by the time i hit &#34;Sober&#34; at window shattering volumes i was in audio nirvana. All but a 5 star rating ( well, there is a whole side D devoted to cricket sounds) and a worthy addition to the collection. If you've got this on cd & own a turntable of respectable quality , do yourself a favour & check out this format, chances are you wont have heard the growls & grunt in the power & rawness that only analog can produce.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I love it. Simple but very addicting. Challenges you to see where you spend your resources, Infrastructure or defence weaponry. Great for blowing time at doctors offices and things of that nature.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Really a book for Tweens/teens...some language, but eerie and interesting. The use of real pix really made it different and added to the atmosphere.
B000059TFO|5.0|GENE HACKMAN IS A VERY GOOD ACTOR.  STORY LINE IS VERY GOOD.  HAD THIS MOVIE ON VHS AND I AM REPLACING IT WITH DVD.  THANKS FOR YOUR VARIETY OF SELECTIONS
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Light up my (NIGHT)life<br /><br />Finally able to NOT trip in the dark!!  Now to just remember to turn it off.....
B00000JMOF|5.0|AGAIN, HAD VHS.  NEEDED DVD.  WATCHED BORIS KARLOFF ALOT IN THE 60'S IN HIS SPOOKY MOVIES.  HE USE TO HAVE A SERIES ON TV CALLED THRILLER!
0062255657|1.0|Bizarre book.  Read 75% and decided I just couldn't finish it.  This is a strange little book that just doesn't make sense and goes from one bad and bizarre situation to another.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is awesome I love the show and when the game came out I got so happy and excited about it!!! Also my friend code is:  cc0280 I play everyday!!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The movie had entertaining parts, but was so sloppy that it just didn't deliver.  I'd have to watch it again, which I won't, to mention all the parts that either didn't make sense or were unnecessary, impossible, or unbelievable - yes I realize this is sci-fi, but you can still make the story believable by doing some homework.<br /><br />I will mention three things that bugged me without any real spoilers.<br />1 - Why in the world would Jack (Tom Cruise) ever need a motorcycle in this environment when his bubble ship could go anywhere the motorcycle could?  The only reason is so that TC could see himself on a motorcycle on the big screen yet again (Top Gun, MI-2, et al).  Unnecessary and stupid.<br />2 - The protection inside the transparent pod on his bubble ship didn't really provide much protection other than the seat-belt harness.  There were several scenes where the one or two people inside would have never survived the shock/forces on them.  Poor physics.  (Yes, there were plenty of other physics issues with the movie, but this was my biggest beef.)<br />3 - The ending was the main sloppy part.  Too many unanswered questions.  They really could have made a nice story out of this, but it was a little more than half a story.  It should have been an hour longer with more development and more loose ends tied up.  What a waste!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is app is awesome. It remind me of my my favorite child hood movie &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, it makes me feel like I'm actually in the movie.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Having read the book first I think the movie did a good job in being true to the story but of course in abbreviated form.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I am on the 2nd level and have to find all the candles but it wont let me click on the last candle I found on the far right of the screen
B00C5ZORES|5.0|The album is officially named Save Rock and Roll, but it's not saving Rock and Roll it's revamping rock and roll. This is the direction that I want rock to go, where it incorporates everyone from everywhere and has all the noises that I want blaring through my speaker to the point where I piss off my neighbors. When FOB wrote this album they thought that they wrote it for themselves, but really they wrote it for me. LOVED IT!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|got to a certain point at the beginning of the game and it would not go any further no matter what I did
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Easy to play very fun and entertainment the kids just love it can't wait to get to next level of fun
