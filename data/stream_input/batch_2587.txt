B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Movie gave some insight to drinking, druging and flying a plane and the relief one feels after one stops using alternate substances.  Entertaining, but not excellent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks you did it again!!! I laughed, I cried, I believed in ability of a spirit sent to guide you in the right direction. Loved it!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|easy game to play.  can level up without being forced to buy items with real money.  both myself and son play.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|This is the first Lupton book I've read, but it cc won't be th rd last. I couldn't put it down.
B008MAI0WK|4.0|For those of us who are not Linux veterans but have a modest understanding of personal computing, this book is an excellent introduction to both the Pi and the world of Linux.  While it may not be the ultimate documentation of every detail, it is excellent in terms of getting your Pi up and running (as well as understanding some of the limitations and problems that may be encountered due to power limitation, etc.).  Would buy it again, and recommend it as a good starting point for setting up and understanding the Raspberry Pi.
B009IF7SWG|5.0|Will Ferrell kills it in this movie. Great cast and Vince Vaughn does a great role in this. Anything with a star cast like these guys will get 5 stars.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This is not a self help, 'do this and you will be rich' kind of book. James spills his heart out in hopes that his readers will learn something from the experiences that he shares. Yes, some of this was taken from his blog posts over the past months, but that seems to be a brilliant way to test your market audience with your writing. If you read his blogs, why be upset with the book? He didn't simply copy and paste each post in hopes that no one would ever notice. He's slightly smarter than that.<br /><br />I did not purchase this book because of the promise of a refund, in fact I requested that my refund go to the charity and I received a thank you email for it.<br /><br />If you read this book and you didn't feel an ounce of his pain through his honesty, then I'm not sure if you were paying attention. You should read it again, it's worth it.<br /><br />Will I make millions from reading this book? No. But, James opened my mind so that I can better prepare myself for success; the rest is on me. That's how it is for everyone, and if you haven't picked up on this idea thus far, then you will forever be doomed into thinking self-help books work.<br /><br />This is not one of those books.<br /><br />Read it and actually soak in what he is trying to relay to you and in the end you will help yourself. Just thank him afterwards, I know I will.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Can see everything better and use all the functions on computer,also it will take you back to the posts that you was looking at instead of only putting you back at the top which was frustrating and annoying
0978545095|5.0|Have seen mailers photographs in multiple shows and wanted a book of her work. The photo graphic quality is excellent, and the selection of photos very good.<br />I would think too for those who have not seen exhibits of her work this would be a fantastic book to consider, as well as for those who already love her work.<br />Unusual subjects, everyday life of all sorts.  Truly eonderful
B00COH0W00|5.0|A sweet love story.  The acting was superb, and the chemistry between Cusak and Beckinsdale made the movie very believable.  I definitely believe in Kismet!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My kids (6,8) love this game. My husband even has to get in on the fun!  Fun to watch and play
0525478817|5.0|It has been a long time since I last read a book this good - Young Adult fiction at its best.  The romance is vaguely reminiscent of Love Story, without the melodrama and the sentimentality.  The language is effervescent and the book grapples with the hard questions of life with tremendous intellectual honesty.<br /><br />I was curious to read what detractors say about the story.  There appear to be two main pieces of criticism.  The first is that the characters don't speak like teenagers.  That seems like a gross over generalization of teenagers.  I certainly spoke like this when I was a teenager, as did most of my friends.  Not every teenager is uneducated and unable to string two words together.  Having said that, we are talking about characters who are extremely erudite - characters who, for instance, find the existential angst of Sylvia Plath interesting.<br /><br />The second is that many of the supporting cast of characters are somewhat unidimensional. This criticism is accurate, but then again, this is a Young Adult novel and not a vast meandering work of literature that fully explores the world.  Moreover, the book is written in first person and in a sense, how much you learn about the various characters is really a function of the narrator's interest in those characters.<br /><br />The point is, if you have not read this book, you should.  There are few books you are likely to encounter that are this moving.
B00821OX98|4.0|Show is good.  Aliens are a little hokey, but animated well.  At times it is a little predictable.  It keeps your interest up, but as is typical of shows it tries very hard to keep you in suspense as to what is going to happen and winds it up in the last 10 minutes.  The rest of the show is all buildup.  Watching the whole season over 3 days brought this home.
0385335989|5.0|Loved this series!  Enjoyed the lives of Jamie and Clare with all the trials they overcome in their historic existance.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I thought the first 3/4 of the book was great, but I thought the graphic description of what cancer had  done to Queenie was a cheap shot. Instead of thinking about what all he went through to get through the pain of losing his son and trying to get over the feeling that he had failed as a father I have the picture in my head of Queenie's horrific disfigurement.  In my opinion it was totally unnecessary to the theme of the story. For his wife to realize that she still loved and wanted him and for him to do the same was a compelling story without the cheap theatrics.  I also got tired of the followers and didn't think they were an interesting addition to the story. They felt like just a filler to me. So again I will say I loved the book until about the last 1/4 and it was anticlimactic -- I just wanted it to end.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that you can set several towns or cities and save them so that you can always check the weather in your presets. It also shows the temperature hourly, the real feel temperature, and the week ahead forecast.
B009NY43NY|4.0|First, I read the first book in the series when it came out and have read something over half of the total. I have not seen the TV version.<br /><br />There are some clumsy bits here, but overall I'd say it's a decent close. Contrary to a lot of the unhappy readers, I generally thought Eric was a jerk (although not bad as satire of a certain type of romantic hero) and I never found the romance all that convincing. Its termination seemed to me to be past due. I thought developments with Sam were consistent with how things had gone before, particularly since it's not absolutely clear what the future is for him and Sookie. I did think his silence was a bit contrived, and the rescue at the end was unsatisfying--it seemed primarily a way to show that Sookie was accepted and well thought of. A bit heavy handed and overly sentimental in my view.<br /><br />On the strongly positive side, I thought the opening scenes were some of Ms. Harris's best writing (perhaps the best), and along with allusions to Christian belief and Sookie's sense of guilt brought something a bit more morally serious to the books. The latter also rounded out Sookie's character. (Please note, I'm not a practicing Christian making a case--I just think the writing was good and the very mild religious element made sense in terms of Sookie's background.) The meditations on being jailed were also quite good.<br /><br />My overall sense of the book is of Sookie reaching a kind of maturity and entering an adult relationship. I think it's also pretty clear that she needs to escape the vampire world for her own survival. Sorry if that makes things too realistic, but I assume it's where the author was heading. That said, I'm sorry the series is finished--it was a lot of fun.<br /><br />My only real disappointment was the absence of Bubba in this book (did I miss something in an earlier volume?). He's a truly great joke, and one I thought the author pulled off rather well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was a fun game. Made it though with the help from my daughter. We had alot of fun and look forward to the next room.
0385335997|5.0|Great books! Loved these books and would recomend the series to everyone.  They are addictive!  I finished one and had to have the next.
B008602KQI|5.0|I recommend this movie...the values and morals were excellent and the acting was super. I give it a thumbs up
B000I9U8VO|5.0|Watched the first one with the kids and liked it. Decided to watch the second one and was impressed. Never been a big fan of sequel movies but liked this one enough to watch the next one.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|A family friend recommended this, and it was wicked. I laughed out loud so often that people in subways gave me funny looks, and when i tried to share a passage or two with my boyfriend it was as though i was speaking chinese! I recommend it to any woman or girl who wants insight into one smart and funny woman's experience.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game and it's just hard enough to be good but not overly complicated like the other games if it's kind.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|very addicting game.  Hope there is a #3.  Can not put. it down.  is a lot better than the first temple run.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|I really liked the first half of this book in spite of the fact that most of the characters appeared to be carved out of cream cheese. The second half of the book lost its grip on me entirely. Too bad, I really had hope  the premise of this book. Still not a bad choice for a light read.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I think this is the best game I have ever played on the Kindle Fire HD.  If you like fighting games then you better buy this game. If I could give this game a rating from 0-1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 I would definitely give it a 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Didnt expect to like the book but i did - interesting stats and research, good message, enjoyable and easy read...
B0045INOCO|4.0|Make no mistake-this is a great movie.  Lot's of fun.  And it makes a good point about the insanity of war and the hypocrisy of claiming its murderous consequences can be subject to some code of fairness or that Kurtz is violating any rules..  Vietnam was America's Saint Vitus's dance.  But the movie comes off as a simple-minded interpretation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness.  Conrad is much better at stripping away the trappings of \\"civilization\\" and showing the ugliness underneath.  And he didn't need the Doors to do it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I finally decided to go ahead and use the new filter and replaced the old one after a season's use. It fits and is doing a good job.
B000024JHZ|5.0|The artwork alone is reason enough to buy the CD. The lyric insert and CD itself are beautifully illustrated. Buy the actual CD don't go for the electronic download.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|I like the game it is fun to play I would sent my friends to this game to play with
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a very great game but it needs more people playing multiplayer I can never find any one ever playing multi player
B00932AA5G|5.0|Foreign movies are entertaining. This one even more so. Quirky. Don't know if it was a comedy or a suspense action thriller. But it was really pleasing. Not at all boring.
0425263924|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books in the Crossfire Series and looked forward to Entwined with You.  For starters, Day mucked up the flow of the story by writing quite a bit of what had transpired in the first two books as if we needed to be reminded.  Then it goes nowhere.  Even the sexual tension is almost boring.  I had hoped to read about the further character developments of Eva and Gideon and a glimpse of their future together and instead am forced to read about the other characters that are really just background noise.  It was almost as if a Ghost Writer had written this book because it is so different.  I felt as if Sylvia Day was laughing at me when she writes \\"This can't possibly be the end.\\"  \\"Kah-ching\\" ($$$$$$$$$$$$$$$)  I'm done.  I hope this is a lesson to other writers that get greedy.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I was put off having to pay separately for a charger and USB cable for my new Kindle so I tried using ones I already was using for other equipment but was disappointed with the length of time it took to charge the Kindle.  So I bought the bullet and bought the charger and cable and have not been disappointed.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book helped me and my husbad with being able to talk to each other and stop some of our petty fights before they even started. We hage been doing wonderful. I recommend this to any married couple or couple thinking of getting married.
B0053TMP24|4.0|I have been reading this with my daughter.  We finished The Lost Hero and enjoyed it so much we are now reading this one, and we will read the next one as well!
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|Great acting and wonderful storytelling.  This film is very different in the way the story unfolds.  It's worth a second viewing.
B001KX50BK|5.0|I ordered this movie to give to my husband for Father's day. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait. We watched it already twice.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app. I love to check on the weather of lots of lovely places and pretend I'm there...instead of stuck in snow.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Weathering with tornados are fun but this game was the bomb it like you can go under water and up on land.here's a hint:-to go under water you have to reach level 10-how many levels 100.
B006OAB2XO|4.0|Grimes, a.k.a. Claire Boucher, has been described by a reviewer as \\"the alien love-child of Aphex Twin and ABBA\\". I think that about sums things up well. This is electronica with a huge dollop of goth. Boucher's dreamy baby-vocals are reminiscent, in parts, of Clare Grogan (of Altered Images) but at times she belts out lyrics with the intensity and intonation of Aimee Mann. Definitely genre-bending, with industrial, darkwave and grave wave flavors readily evident, \\"Visions\\" is worth a listen, if only to explore Boucher's multidirectional effort that spans a huge swathe of timetines and styles -- from \\"Genesis\\", which sounds like J-pop, to \\"Oblivion\\", which starts off in a manner reminiscent of Hazel O'Connors' \\"D-Days\\".
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I think this is one of the most fun games ever created.  And with most games, you can't seem to get ahead but this game lets you if you're good.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|I ordered this movie to give to my husband for Father's day. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait. We watched it already twice.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|I know there have only been three versions of Howleen (including this one), but this one is by far the prettiest. This time around Howleen has straight long hair that goes down all the way past her waist with blunt cut bangs. On the actual doll her bangs have more of a curve to them and I think they look much cuter than the stock photo. Her hair is two shades of pink, super bright neon pink and streaks of a lighter shade of bubblegum pink. On her head she wears an adorable black beanie with little knubby balls all over it. Her cute little ears poke out through the top of the beanie!!! Her facepaint is soooo pretty. Her lips are hot pink. She has medium purple shadow lining her lower eyes and also extending from her upper lashline past the crease of her eye. Her browbone has a light pink color with opalescent glitter on top. The purple shadow really accents her golden orange eyes. She wears a tankdress that is mostly black with some blue and hot pink paw prints and yellow ladder type designs on it. The bottom hem of the dress has a neon green band across it. Over her dress she wears a dark purple metallic pleather jacket with 3/4 sleeves. Under her dress she wears sheer neon pink capri length footless tights. Her belt is blue with metallic gold pyramid studs. She has one metallic gold pyramid stud in her left ear, and one thick black and one thick purple bracelet on her right wrist. On her left hand she wears a single black fishnet glove. Her purse is metallic gold with a chain strap and some blue accents. Her boots are simply adorable. The are black lace up combat style boots. There are two layers of gold studs at the top of the boots and the wedge heel has little crossbones molded into them. She comes with her pet hedgehog Cushion who is hot pink this time (in the sisters pack with version one Howleen, Cushion is orange.)  She also comes with a black brush, black stand, and diary. Her diary talks about how she is confused with what she wants to do in her life and also talks about her good friend Twyla, who is a \\"boogeygirl\\". I am totally in love with this version of Howleen and I hope mattel keeps putting out other ones as well. (I would love to see a fancy dance/party version of Howleen). Howleen has really clawed her way into my heart!!
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is a lot of fun. Great story line and special effects. I watched them a season at a time without interruptions. Ver y enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  Suzanne Collins wrote a great series, as everyone knows.  I think the books are better than the movies.  Very popular as you well know.  the books are worth the buy.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|A classic piece with all the charm and quirk of the Hollywood productions in that era. P.S. Hitchcock's presence in the first minute of the movie is an adorable, pleasant surprise.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I am enjoying this game very much. The layouts build up, the designs are bright and colorful. Only complaint I have is I would like to play it landscape but it doesn't turn.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I didn't normally read harlequin books but decided to read this one or was good and not to trashy like I remember and I'm happy about that. It was nice to read on the story and not all about sex.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|not only do the grandkids love this so do I.....it's fun and there's so many different graffics that are colorful and makes it exciting to move to the next level.  fun game
B00821OX98|5.0|I did not have high hopes for this show but the more I watch the more I want to keep watching. 5 stars.
B00866JL96|4.0|Great story on a man finding true love, but as usual in Nick's movies, someone dies.  At least in this one, the one that perishes is someone we really don't like.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game it moves fast and is entertaining. Good times. Easy to get out and play game almost anywhere especially while waiting for appointments.
6305428050|5.0|I loved this movie the minute it came out and I saw it at the show.  I had to have it and am so pleased to have it in my library.  Great movie, fun and charming.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is needed for any Blu-ray movie collection. ANY OF THEM. This movie is possibly the best super hero movie made to date.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|this is another Nick Sparks stories where someone dies leaving the person with profound epiphany on life and love.  This one was more understated than the rest.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|There are very few films of this length that don't wear out their welcome long before they end.  This gem, however, could have gone on for hours more!  This is definitely not a film that will appeal to the defenders of the status quo.  But for those who long for a better way, this vision just might reach your soul!
B00007GZR0|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I loved it when it was at the show and I had to have it.  Great story and can't say enough about the actors.  Don't make great movies like this anymore.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Took a while to get going but really clever plot. Ending quite a bit different and certainly unexpected.. Good read
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Great story that is based on a true story where they show you the actual couple who lives today. (They look nothing like the actors in this movie.)  Touching and frustrating to see how people deal with the fact of no memory but still have that spiritual connection.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It's fun, except for the really baaaaaaadddddd voice acting and the flight controls being fairly uncontrollable? Other than that..can be a fun time waster.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like this game but as with so many like this the progress is slow and sometimes frustrating.  I feel they make it so you have to buy more coins all the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS is the best app in the world.Whoever would give this app a rating of 3 and under is CRAZY!
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Action pack flick where the Rock blows people away with ruthless abandon.  The only question I have at the end of this movie is - If you killed all the people that wronged you and set you up, what do you do then.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I really liked this game, and I wish I could add more user content without buying it from the in-app store.<br /><br />5 starts if it didn't have in-app purchases
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great series....you have to get them all, you just can't read one.  She's a great writer, very different and exciting.  You'll love each one.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I like this game but I wouldn't give it 5stars.I think this app should at least be in the top 25
B000683VI4|5.0|I really loved this movie.  Very touching at the end but what a surprise and a twist about half way through.  After watching this I do believe two people's love can do anything.  By far the best Nicholas Sparks movies which all other will be marked against.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|This game is way better than I thought. I can't stop playing it when I'm in line or waiting for the bus. Fun and entertaining
B0015346OM|5.0|This book really keeps you on your toes.  It is so intense but I really enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down.  That is was the truth was amazing but what these men went through, their bravery beyond belief is something everyone should read and know about...and I'm a 65 year old grandmother!!!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|As expected her music did not disappoint. Can not wait to get to hear her newest stuff. It will be epic I'm sure.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love the graphics but at times the clues were hard to follow. I can't wait for the next chapter.<br /><br />Von.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|We love this movie. It is a true Disney classic. Great music and message. I hadn't seen it for a long time, and really got a kick out of the lyrics to Scar's song about the Hyenas. You'll love this movie.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is highly addictive.....and fun.  It keeps me from doing things so I have to pace myself.  It's pretty easy to play also.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I downloaded The Room to my Kindle and was immediately hooked! After solving a number of the puzzles, I hit a wall. My 13 year old son asked to have a go. He solved the next section. My 20 year old daughter took charge and kept going till I finally pried the Kindle from her fingers. Regardless of who held the stylus, the graphics, challenges and slightly macabre feel kept the family engaged from start to finish. We look forward to exploring additional rooms in the future!
B0074PNCRM|4.0|This is an amazing book and beautifully crafted. It is not for the faint of heart because it doesn't patronise its adolescent subjects and it does delve directly into mortality and the sometimes grim reality of cancer.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Great show with great quality picture. I'm addicted to it now. Never got a chance to watch it while it was still on tv.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I bought this for my grandkids to keep them busy and they positively love it.  One of them is only 3 and she loves it and is able to do it.  It's fun and colorful and even fun for adults!!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|The book is an enjoyable read.  What else do you want??  Richard Dawkins is bright, funny, knowledgeable, and entertaining.  He presents his ideas so beautifully.  A real pleasure.
B00004TH83|1.0|On her album \\"Pure\\" she started the song \\"J'Taime\\" so well, and then ruined it, and that is what she does with every song here. She has too much liking for drama in her singing. And the more drama, the less emotion. Drama is fine in opera, but over the top in popular music.<br /><br />\\"Part Of Me\\" is a lovely melody beautifully sung, but then the choir-amped chorus ruins everything. She can sing with incredible sensitivity, but always follows by tightening up her throat to shut down the emotion and wind up the dramatic intensity.<br /><br />The worst thing here is \\"Love By Grace\\". After you hear Wynonna rip your heart out on this song on her \\"Revelations\\" album, you will know what Lara needs to fix. That she recorded it after Wynonna also tells us her producer Walter Afanasieff let her down badly.<br /><br />You could rebuild her into a world-beater if she wanted it. But she probably doesn't.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|This movie was a creative version of explaining the wizards story.  I love james franco and mila kunis. It was not a bad attempt. The Land of oz is a beautiful place. Looks awesome in HD.
B000056BOR|5.0|If you want a great movie buy this one.  It has two of my most favorite movie stars.  It's charming, funny and heart-warming.  I love Cary Grant and Doris Day.  Must have on your fav list.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Do you now ventureian he is the most awesome and amazing person I know on youTube if you don't know him go on YouTube!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I'm just a big kid at heart and get a giggle out of this. Plus it involves logic planning the best route so I feel like it's working my brain along with my funny bone. :-)
B00957T6X6|5.0|Can't put the book down...waiting to see what will happen next. Well worth the $$$$ for the 5 book set !
B005HSL626|4.0|It's funny and well done. Also, it's kind of hard because there's only one chance (life). One mistake and you're done...
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This app is great for quick 5-10 minute targeted workouts. Right before showering or during tv shows it's so easy to access routines to follow. I've been using this for about a month now and I've already noticed some definition and tone. I am already a moderate exerciser so this just adds to my consistent exercise routine.<br /><br />It is great for any level of exercise. You focus on how many reps you can do in periods of 45 secs to a minute depending on how long you chose to exercise. You can build your way up to completing each exercise for a complete minute.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Kids Love this Game it keeps the entertained for hours, kind of got addicted to it myself. Would Recommend. Very Cool
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|There needs to be other ways to get more coins other than that the app is great and is good that it is free
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Just read it! Always good to learn from real experiences! There is a good chance that it will change your life.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|I'm really glad I used an app credit to download this game on my Kindle. I played one chapter and saved to play later. Game kept crashing after second attempt to play. I just deleted it and wont buy from this app maker again.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I did actually rather enjoy this book. I won't give any spoilers, but my decision to give the book only three stars is due to the lackluster climax. An excellent story let down by corny ending. The real ending got my attention though, and I may continue the series anyway.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy this F***ing  updat just came out 0.7.1<br />I lov it buy it ul lov it trust me plus u get to troll peeps online
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Thought the movie was pretty good overall and it gave me some good laughs and chuckles.<br /><br />Was almost turned off from watching it after seeing all the 1 star ratings. Defiantly not a 1 star by any means in my opinion and I'm a tough critic.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My granddaughter loves this dvd. It's the first of many I'm sure, but we'll see as she gets older. When the big fish is chasing the little mermaid, she screams with excitement & delight, she claps her hands & bounces on her bottom. LOL
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I like the detail Hosseini weaves into the lives of the people in the story, and the vividness of the setting in Afghanistan.  Hosseini has a peculiar insight into the souls of his characters that transcends ethnicity and can relate to all of us.  I have enjoyed his books,  Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  And The Mountains Echoed was again another quality work from this author.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Love this game it's so a great game to play when it bored...  so in depth it's going to take forever to beat the game.. unlike most kindle games in which u can beat in half a week... definitely worth the money
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Good<br />Good luck with your own project for the school project management system and scholar award for the ground and a half years ago
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Disney is doing a great job with these marvel classics. This movie is about the origins of captain America and is really to lead up to the avengers. Enjoy!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have to say that I have really enjoyed the whole Crossfire series, thus my 5 stars, my only problem being that after 3 books, the series is still not done and at $9.99 a pop, I am now almost $30 into this. Very frustrating to spend that kind of money and not know how many more books it will take. Not to mention it took so long for the release of the third book of the series, that I had to go back and reread the first two again because there was a lot  that happens and many characters involved in the first two that I had forgotten. So I am wondering  how long it will take before the next book is released, and at what cost to complete the series?
B00C061I3K|5.0|Has there ever been a better marketed album prior to its release than Daft Punk's \\"Random Access Memories?\\" You would have a hard time finding one. After a brilliant series of video interviews featuring The Collaborators from the album along with hints of the tracks, fans of Daft Punk knew that this was going to be something special. But the promotion left a high level of mystery. Until the album's leak, available streaming on iTunes, fans had no idea what this would sound like. Expectations were extremely high and \\"Random Access Memories\\" does not disappoint. Let's jump right into the first track...    \\"Give Life Back to Music\\" opens like the opening to an album, not the opening of an individual song. Those first three notes are big, powerful and grandiose. There's a ton of energy in that opening and then it pulls you into a groove that's so silky smooth, you're almost taken aback by it. One of the things Daft Punk has done really well throughout their career is contrast. By opening with brash chords, the slip into the Nile Rodgers driven guitar groove feels like a trip into another world, a world in which pop music hasn't lived in decades.    Throughout the album, the robot voice (vocoder) is a fantastic way to remind the listener that what they are hearing is Daft Punk. \\"The Game of Love\\" uses the vocoder vocals well proving that a \\"robot voice\\" can be just as expressive (if not more) than a human's.    \\"Giorgio\\" is definitely a polarizing track. Putting a 9 minute epic as the third track on your album is bold. But music lovers have to appreciate the incredible composition it is. \\"Giorgio\\" is an exploration throughout funk/early electronic music. The personnel on this track is loaded. The talent and technique exhibited throughout Giorgio is inspiring.    My only critique of the album is that it could use horn players. A saxophone, trumpet and/or trombone would have added an additional layer of sound, not to mention brought even more energy to the tracks. Many ofthe legendary disco groups and songs featured great horn sections. A homage to the disco era feels like it's missing something without horns.    Daft Punk are so attentive to detail in their sound engineering that the spoken sections by Giorgio Moroder (who everybody calls Giorgio) were done with 6 different microphones as he discusses different eras. Would anybody notice that? Probably not. But Daft Punk would. The grand finale, which Giorgio describes as \\"the sounds of the future,\\" is dazzling.    A piano interlude by the fantastic Chilly Gonzales takes us into \\"Within.\\" It's a really pretty melody with the most interesting sung lyrics of the album, thus far. \\"Please tell me who I am,\\" \\"looking for someone\\"... these are emotional lyrics. They also take on a very different meaning when sung by a robot. The robots are experiencing emotion. The robots are becoming sentient!! IS NO ONE ELSE TERRIFIED?    Anyway, \\"Instant Crush\\" opens with what sounds eerily like Wham!'s \\"Last Christmas\\" but is carried by The Strokes' lead singer, Julian Casablancas. The first minute of the song is very a straight ahead groove, heavy on downbeats with little syncopation. When the chorus comes in, it's a brand new tune with a groove heavy on upbeats and syncopation. Due to the contrast between the chorus and verse, the chorus feels even funkier than it is (and it's already very funky). \\"Instant Crush\\" has potential to be the album's second big single.    The heaviest hitter among the collaborators, Pharrell Williams, makes his first appearance on the album with \\"Lose Yourself to Dance.\\" However Pharrell is not the takeaway from this track, it is Nile Rodgers' fantastic playing, again. He is a master of groove, dictating the entire feel of the song with his complex, rhythmic guitar riffs. Rodgers may be the MVP of the album.    \\"Touch\\" is a bit out there for me. It's slightly disappointing as it features Paul Williams, composer of maybe the greatest song ever written for a film, \\"The Rainbow Connection\\" (which is masterfully sung by a puppet frog on the river, playing a banjo). The climax is grandiose, but it takes a long time to get there.    [...]  Here we get the album's hit single (and it's not even close), \\"Get Lucky.\\" The NY Times piece on the song gives an excellent description of  why \\"Get Lucky\\" may be the biggest hit of the summer due to its genre-defiance and marketability. Though played by real drums, the drum track is manipulated to sound driving and almost electronic. Mixed with another great guitar groove by Rodgers and vocals from Pharrell, \\"Get Lucky\\" combines modern and disco sounds expertly, especially considering that none of the album's tracks were recorded together.    One way in which \\"Get Lucky\\" has Daft Punk's flavor is through the use of the duo's trademark technique of presenting a melody, then a counter-melody, and finally the two melodies on top of each other. In \\"Get Lucky,\\" it's Pharrell's vocals, the robotic vocoder vocals, and then the two together. It's the blueprint for Discovery, Alive 2007 (in which they combined tracks/melodies from different albums), and a couple songs from Random Access Memories. It's interesting that while the groove may sound totally different, the basic musical structure remains the same.    After a grand orchestral opening, complete with a string section and timpani, \\"Beyond\\" falls into a groove reminiscent of Michael McDonald's \\"I Keep Forgettin'.\\" When recording the album, Daft Punk sought to achieve what they called a \\"west coast vibe,\\" referencing groups like the Doobie Brothers. Somewhat surprisingly, it was the short lived (and historically under appreciated) Michael McDonald-era of the Doobie Brothers sound that they achieved.    \\"Motherboard\\" is a track that will likely be overlooked, but it may be the closest thing to the Daft Punk of old. If Discovery were to be recorded by talented musicians without samples and loops, it would sound something like \\"Motherboard.\\" It sounds likesomething out of a spy thriller (think Bourne Identity).    \\"Fragments of Time\\" features Todd Edwards, best known for his previous Daft Punk collaboration \\"Face to Face.\\" While \\"Face to Face\\" sampled an Electric Light Orchestra song (Evil Woman), it sounded nothing like a record that could come out of the 1970s. \\"Fragments of Time\\" sounds like a Hall & Oates record. It may be cheesy, the lyrics are uninspiring, but it gives a modern touch to an 80s groove that brilliantly creates a new sound. It is a minor detail but in the chorus, in between the sung lyrics, there are a series of isolated guitar and keyboard figures, recorded on different tracks which sound like choppy fragments of phrases. As the song is about \\"Fragments of Time,\\" Daft Punk continue to show their mastery of sound engineering.    \\"Doing it Right\\" features Panda Bear of Animal Collective, one of the more innovative electronic bands today.  It is one of the rare tracks on the album with little to no disco influence. For me, it falls short in terms of energy. The track does not build throughout, though it does use Daft Punk's technique of presenting melody, counter-melody, then the two together. Humans and robots singing in harmony. Beautiful stuff.    \\"Contact\\" is a gripping ending which makes great use of a quote from Apollo 17 in which an astronaut gives us reason to believe there is life outside of Earth. The five note phrase after \\"there's something out there\\" is chilling. What \\"Doing it Right\\" lacks in build, \\"Contact\\" more than makes up for. It culminates with an all out headbanging rock feel supporting an ascending synthesizer which sounds like a spaceship leaving Earth. It shows the depth of what the synthesizer can do and just how far it has come.    Earlier in the album, Giorgio discusses the synthesizer as being the sound of the future. With Random Access Memories, Daft Punk have left their mark on what the future should sound like. By recreating sounds of the past, with modern elements, Daft Punk pay homage to music's recent history while setting the bar for contemporaries. It is a timeless album and one that can be appreciated by all fans of music, young and old, not just fans of Daft Punk.

B001N9ESQ4|5.0|With the third installment to this story about to come out this summer I happened to see the first movie 'Before Sunrise' on Cable TV about 2 weeks ago and rented 'Before Sunset&#34; via Amazon Prime.  I loved it. The story took a twist I didn't expect and the characters were the same comfortable people we came to know in the first movie.  Loved that they both moved on, but still savored the things they had years before.  Would definitely recommend this movie - can't wait to see the threequel!

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I almost couldn't read this book it was so horrific; this young man born into the life as a prisoner in a work camp run by fear, torture, emotional and physical torment, and starvation. Never to know love, trust, or comfort. And to think, so many more like him that cant get out! It made me so sad, then very mad, yet at the same time opened my eyes to the truth of North Korea and concentration camps in our world TODAY! How you can hold the children for 3 generation accountable for an ancestor's actions and treat them like that is horrible! As humans, we do terrible things for power, power, control, and prestige.  Shin Dong-hyuk life story of growing up in the camp, escaping, then trying to find help is captivating like no other book I've read. He eventually makes his way to the US and learns to love and connect, but struggles with fitting into such a different world, never really trusting or Knowing his way. No wonder, the way he was raised from birth! I want to reach out and help him after reading his story.<br /><br />A friend of mine lent me the hard bound copy, and I followed along in google maps the locations described in the book. Using aerial phoyography, you can clearly see the camp, the dam, and the escape routes by typing in the following in google maps:<br />Type in:<br />39° 34' 25\\", 126° 4' 5\\"<br />Or<br />Bo-wi-bu No. 14 Headquarters, South Pyongan, North Korea<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down and read it in a single day. It is  well written, captivating, and easy to follow. Blaine Hardin has does an excellent job interviewing Shin and verifying the accuracy of his story. Hopefully this book will bring this terrible problem of child labor camp to eyes of people world wide so we can move in the direction of putting an end to this horror!

B007EECSFA|4.0|I particularly like Kate Morton's books but I was a bit disappointed with this one.  The plot was well crafted as was the writing but I couldn't get past some of the attitudes of the characters.  I won't say not to read it but it is one of those stories that can be either throughly enjoyed and taken at face value or disputed.  It depends on your frame of reference, but the ending is satisfying and she ties up all the loose ends in a convincing manner.

It is told from the horse Joey' s point of view as he goes from an English farm, to the army, to the Germans, and back to the English.<br />  This book can be enjoyed by any ages, but the language (though few) is not a good aspect.<br />  I can definitely see why Steven Spielberg made his movie from this enjoyable book!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|When my book club chose The Kite Runner as our next book a few years ago, I was really iffy about it.  The author was unknown to me and the subject manner really did not appeal.  Happily it was fantastic, as was A Thousand Splendid Suns!  Then FINALLY another novel from Khaled Hosseini, And the Mountains Echoed.  No doubt this author can weave a mesmerizing tale; however, for me, something happened in the last quarter of the book; that is, it ran out of steam; leading to a flat ending.  This novel left me wanting much more.  Which I guess is a good thing from an author's point of view, since I will be waiting for his next novel and hoping for a more defining climax and falling action please.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|Usually when you buy an album, there are only about 3-4 songs that are really worth listening and the rest are all garbage.

0988178532|1.0|I'm not normally one to leave negative reviews, but I felt that this occasion warranted it, given the flood of generic and uninformative positive reviews on this book.<br /><br />The story starts off strong, and it was a fascinating premise--a boy who is afraid he is going mad appears to be having visions of his past lives, all of which end violently and abruptly. However, almost immediately in chapter two, the book starts to unravel. It becomes very choppy and disjointed, breaking off scenes and chapters with no apparent reason other than the author wanting to leave that chapter with an ominous sentence. Decisions come out of nowhere; for instance, the main character is one day refusing to talk to ANYONE about what he's experiencing, and the next he's spilling his guts about it to everyone in his approximate age group and planning to break his brother out of an insane asylum. Why? Because his brother experienced some of the same things that he's going through but will \\"never reveal his secrets while medicated in an institution.\\" Any evidence of that? Nope. Have they even tried just talking to the brother yet? Nope.<br /><br />The author also has a frustrating tendency to dump information on the unsuspecting reader out of nowhere. Okay, so the main character's having these 'outviews,' these visions. But then he starts hitting the reader over the head with a ton of other hitherto unmentioned issues. Oh, yeah, I see people's auras. And pops of light over their heads. And I see things from Native American mythology out of the corner of my eye that aren't there. And I hear voices and a rushing sound like the wind. I have premonitions, too! And, oh, yes, it seems that there's some creepy conspiracy that resulted in my dad's death. (Not that he got any premonitions about that, or about anything else that might be useful.)Oh, yes, and in these outviews, I can recognize other people that I know in their past incarnations, too! Didn't I mention that from the beginning? No? Silly me.<br /><br />In short, this book was frustrating and disjointed. With all of these problems, coupled with the formatting errors and typos, I will not be continuing in this series.illy me.<br /><br />In short, this book was frustrating and disjointed.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so awesome. I mean seriously it's not easy but it's not hard. It's more of a mind game. You have to defeat obstacles and clues. This game involves codes ,puzzles, and patterns. I can't wait to play other games like this one. So I think you should try it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game but hard to see on a small screen.<br /><br />I just started though so maybe I will get used to it.
B0086213XW|4.0|The problem with long term relationships is that they can be taken for granted. True love can feel stale sometimes, and temptations arrive when we drop our guard. In my opinion, Michelle Williams gives a great performance. It's hard to judge or blame her character, yet by the end of the movie it is clear her gamble was a mistake.<br /><br />One drawback of the movie is its obscure sexual content. Some scenes seem gratuitous, lacking in both plot development and believability.

0316098337|1.0|I didn't finish the book. I was turned off right away. It is supposedly narrated by a five-year-old boy. I assume that the author has no children or, if she does, she rarely speaks with them, and that she never paid attention to other people's children. No one familiar with children would find his narration at all believable. Sometimes he talks like a two-year-old, other times like an adult. It is therefore perhaps the worst written book I ever attempted to read.<br /><br />Reading about a girl locked in a room for a considerable length of time and repeatedly raped provides me with no entertainment. I am not into B&D and similar outlets.<br /><br />I would bet that if it gets translated into Arabic it will be a best seller among the Taliban.<br /><br />Barry Blyveis

B008JFUPK8|5.0|A sole survivor of the doomed planet Krypton grows up on Earth and discovers he has abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Once grown, he sets off to find out who he is and where he comes from. The answer is discovered in a spaceship in the arctic and Krypton's last son, Kal-El--Clark Kent--meets a hologram of his long-dead father, Jor-El, who reveals to him his destiny: a beacon of hope for humanity, and also one who could one day restore the doomed Kryptonian race.<br /><br />Enter Zod, a harsh general and one who has fought his whole life to protect Krypton and its people. During an altercation with Jor-El he finds out that Jor-El has sent his newborn son off world and along with the child plans for Kryptonian's future. A battle ensues and Zod is sent off planet, too, him and his cohorts banished to the Phantom Zone for rehabilitation. When Krypton explodes, the containment units holding Zod and his followers release them and he spends the next thirty-three years combing the stars, searching for Jor-El's son.<br /><br />Locating Kal-El on Earth, Zod sends an ultimatum to the planet, forcing Kal-El to reveal himself to the humans and to stop Zod from using Earth as ground zero for a new Krypton. Zod, like Kal-El, is now powered by the Earth's yellow sun and is empowered with superabilities. An enormous battle ensues between Krypton's general and Kal-El, the fate of the Earth hanging in the balance.<br /><br />What can I say? This movie is mind blowing! It's epic, it's incredible. So much was riding on this film to deliver a Superman movie that would captivate audiences and restore the Man of Steel to his rightful place as king of the superheroes. Man of Steel does just that and then some, bringing with it the awesome sci-fi factors of Star Wars to the dense storytelling of The Dark Knight Trilogy.<br /><br />There has never, ever been a superhero movie like this before. Henry Cavill as Superman nailed the part. He's a nice guy, a caring guy, but he's dead serious about doing the right thing and exudes the confidence that only one who has sold himself out for the good of all can portray. He did something that was never done before by any other Superman actor: showing Clark Kent before he was Superman or even the bumbling reporter of the Daily Planet. (I'm referring to the movies, not Smallville). In fact, he's this version of Clark Kent for nearly the whole movie. You can see him making the big decisions, weighing his upbringing against this new task of saving the world that was suddenly dropped on his lap. You journey along with him as he wrestles with his being different and how those differences apply to not just his life, but the lives of others. As Superman, he's the Superman. I never thought Christopher Reeve's performance could be outdone, but Henry Cavill matches, if not exceeds, what Mr. Reeve brought to the character. Cavill's Superman is one hundred percent devoted to staying true to who he is, his abilities, his upbringing, his quest for truth and justice, and for putting his foot down both with men and rebel Kryptonians when needed. I can't really comment on his reporter Clark persona because that's not a big role in this movie. I hope, however, it will be in the sequel and we'll see plenty of Lois and Clark interaction in the next one, especially after the way the Lois and Clark relationship is portrayed in this movie. You'll have to see for yourself to see what I mean.<br /><br />Michael Shannon as Zod was crazy good. The guy can act and his Zod is much different than Terrence Stamp's. Yes, both are ruthless, but whereas Stamp's Zod was more about power grabbing and his desire to rule, Shannon's is about giving it his all to restore the former glory of Krypton at any cost, even if that means eradicating all of Earth's population to do it. The best villain is always the villain you accidently find yourself rooting for, and that happened to me throughout this movie. Every so often I felt for Zod and understoodwhat he was trying to accomplish. It made sense and made me consider that maybe if I was in his shoes I would've done the same thing or something similar.<br /><br />Amy Adams as Lois Lane was a good choice. I wasn't sure at first, as I know Amy Adams as more of a happy-go-lucky girl from other movies far removed from the superhero genre--though she was in one episode of Smallville during its first season--but she sold me on the part and she reminded of the Lois Lanes from the old cartoons: warm, but cut and dry. Funny, but serious about what she does and her desire to go the distance to get a story.<br /><br />The action in this movie was crazy huge. The bar has been set so high in terms of superhero cinema in recent years and Man of Steel makes every superhero movie that's come before it look like a puppet show in comparison. The wide-scale destruction wrought by Superman and Zod--never mind Zod's right-hand-woman Faora and the other rebel Kryptonians--is what you'd expect if people with god-like powers let loose in an all-out brawl across a city. And the speed, man, the speed! Normally super speed is shown as either a big blur or done in slo-mo, with the super speedsters moving quickly while everyone else is frozen. In this one, you see Superman et al. zipping around, pausing, breaking sound barriers, and bringing the viewer along as if we're in his shoes the whole time and experiencing the thrill of super speed ourselves. The way Superman flies in this is unlike any other portrayal before, and while I loved how he flies in the other movies and TV shows, in this one he seems to hurl himself through the air at times, while at others flies with precision and care. The heat vision effect in this was stellar. The glow beneath the skin around the eyes and to see the veins beneath its surface made it all the more menacing. The super hearing and X-ray vision were familiar territory to those who've watched Smallville, but there was no all-out X-ray vision where everything is dark blue and white.<br /><br />The fighting between Superman and Zod was serious business and was truly a portrayal of two warriors going toe-to-toe and not just wrestling or tapping each other. It was one crazy hard blow after another, some slow, some rapid, even some in the sky! Insane! So many times I was blown away and just going wow, wow, wow! Zod fought the skill of a trainer warrior, whereas Superman fought with brute force.<br /><br />Man of Steel is a crazy good movie with a strong story, an incredible cast, and superhero action that has now become the benchmark for anything to follow. To be honest, I don't know if it can be followed. Hopefully in Man of Steel 2.<br /><br />Super recommended.what he was trying to accomplish. It made sense and made me consider that maybe if I was in his shoes I would've done the same thing or something similar.<br /><br />Amy Adams as Lois Lane was a good choice. I wasn't sure at first, as I know Amy Adams as more of a happy-go-lucky girl from other movies far removed from the superhero genre--though she was in one episode of Smallville during its first season--but she sold me on the part and she reminded of the Lois Lanes from the old cartoons: warm, but cut and dry. Funny, but serious about what she does and her desire to go the distance to get a story.<br /><br />The action in this movie was crazy huge. The bar has been set so high in terms of superhero cinema in recent years and Man of Steel makes every superhero movie that's come before it look like a puppet show in comparison. The wide-scale destruction wrought by Superman and Zod--never mind Zod's right-hand-woman Faora and the other rebel Kryptonians--is what you'd expect if people with god-like powers let loose in an all-out brawl across a city. And the speed, man, the speed! Normally super speed is shown as either a big blur or done in slo-mo, with the super speedsters moving quickly while everyone else is frozen.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is best version -- don't update if you don't want the new one. I prefer this format the new one is strange.
3836532441|5.0|This book arrived quickly, was well packaged, and is full of vibrant pictures. It is full of great biographies of the artists and wonderful prints.  A must have for pin-up lovers. Thank you!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This show is full of excitement, suspense and humor. I watch one or two episodes a day. Can't wait to watch the rest of the seasons.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Grisham is always great and this is one of better series.  Each one gets a little better. Great little book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is so good.  Hate to have it end and can't wait for next season. Downloading is so easy. I will use this service again.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love this game it was amazing I hope everyone buys this game. I want to play other games just like it
B005K0S2SW|5.0|This is a great album! Like always, Trombone Shorty's instrumentals are just as lively, if not more so, than the songs with lyrics!
B009R659L8|5.0|Everything Mary H Clark does is fabulous and this is one of her better books.  Never disappointed with her books.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Eva and Gideon. It's nice to know that even people as messed up as they are can still find love and function. Gives me hope that one day I will find my dark and dangerous even though my chances are slim considering I'm in my mid fifties.<br />Right now I'm happy to live my life through your great story. Please, please don't make us wait long for the next phase in lives.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|The excellent writing is exceeded by the stellar performances.  Immediately captured by the story; cannot wait until the 2014 season TWO.
B001XVD21Y|5.0|Loved it great acting lotsa blood but riveting You know Scorsese its gonna be awesome. I would consider buying it just to have around.
B004UID2LC|3.0|after  you have it for about two months it starts to crash and then says you have to install it again which is annoying other than that it is ok
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would totally reccomend getting it. alothough I wish the gems were easier to get instead of having to buy them.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I enjoyed every song on this album, especially the old standards.  He has a way of putting a song across that always makes it sound fresh.  I highly recommend this album
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Although I didn't feel the story to be very immersive I really enjoyed this book and felt curious enough to read the saga end to end in just a few seats.<br /><br />The plot is intelligent and reasonably original, specially considering that there's hardly any fiction being written nowadays with innovative story elements, scenarios etc. The silos remind me of the shelters from Fallout 3 - the game - except that Hugh Howey took the wasteland outside the silos to a new level of danger.<br /><br />I'm curious to read the continuation and I would recommend this book for every fan of good dystopian science fiction.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone of all ages. Make sure you read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians first to get all of this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Card's best book in this series, the rest are also ran's and can be quite confusing to follow. Read this book when it first came out and loved it. Been waiting on the movie for 20 years, hope it stays true to the book but most likely it will be pc'ed to death, shame.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was totally enthralled by these books. Fascinating concept and well executed. This was one of the few Kindle books I actually bought, though at a discounted price. Well worth the money.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I thought that this would be the end of the Clifton Chronicles, and I guess not as this again ends with a cliff hanger!  I just love the family and know that Archer has not finished with them as there is a lot of unfinished stories!  Can't wait!
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This book is amazayn<br />It will make you laugh<br />It will make you cry<br />And it will do what all great books do.<br />See the world from another perspective.<br />This is sutible for all ages.<br />Everyone will enjoy it.<br />Another amazayn book from John Green.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|This was a fun story set in Bujold's Vorkosigan world.  it contains the characterization, action, humor, and plot twist one expects from Bujold. I found it more satisfying than Cryoburn.  The premise is highly improbable, but without it there would be no story.  It is somewhat similar in premise to Shards of Honor. Male and female protagonists are brought together by chance, forced to be in close proximity with leads to romance. There are numerous asides to remind the reader of Captain Vorpatril's relationship with Miles Vorkosigian and his retinue.  They interrupted the flow of the story with extra unneeded characters, unless them happen to be your favorite. Vor fans enjoy!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Tom Cruise did a better job in this film than in past episodes. It was definitely was worth the watch time.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This version was visually superb and filmed in a period style that has to make you smile at the &#34;old fashioned&#34; delivery and sentimentality.  For anyone who is an ardent fan of the original, this film is a satisfying prequel and good family entertainment.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Glad that I read this book - we did it as a book review.  I never knew this happened.  It was interesting to also know that some of the people in our group remember stories from their parents/grandparents about the train.  At first I had a hard time following the story going back and forth but I finally got used to that.  I was glad to see how the two present day characters helped each other.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I guess I needed closure and I guess I got it - somewhat. These books used to be spicy, hot and fun page turners, and now they're bland, flat and vanilla.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great I Love this Game It Keeps Me Going For Hours. Even When Im Bored I Go To This Game
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|I own Starry Night at home but this app is great and easy to use.  Very versatile time of day, direction and 0 to 90 degree views with planets, moons, solar and other objects of interest located instantly.  Fantastic on all my devices but exceptionally clear on my Kindle HD!
B000E6UK32|4.0|The CD was damaged, but only in the case, not the CD.  I have not played the video, but suspect it is in pristine condition.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down! This is a great summer read, I've bought it for several friends too!
B008KP6ENE|4.0|I keep going back to this game. It's addictive. You play through levels collecting buttons and paperclips for points. There are about 30 levels total. They have different themes and monsters you have to defeat. Overall this game is a lot like a game station game like mario. There's a few things about the game that are negative. First, the whole cute vibe that the game makers seem to have been going for falls flat. It's a neat idea but not carried out well. Second, it is too hard. I grew up playing a lot of PlayStation games and this ranks high on the difficulty scale. Not all that enjoyable at times. Third, there are some glitches. It crashes occasionally. Also if you die during a level and you go back to a checkpoint, you still loose all your progress in the game (buttons and paperclips collected). all in all I do recommend this game despite its shortfalls because for the money it is a quality product with thought put into its development.
044024613X|4.0|This book was well written and interesting.  It certainly left the reader with a lot of food for thought.  I found it interesting that asperger's syndrome was not ever mentioned.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Everyone needs a list or task list from time-to-time.<br />This one is easy to use and has several useful ways to sort or prioritize.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great movie. Watched it with my daughters. Loved it!<br />Very intense and true to times even though it is set in the 90's
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|my friend got this and he said there might of been cusing in this! I was going to use it for a city walk around and stuff so I don't know what about it!!!
0345525558|5.0|I am greatly enjoyed reading this book and found it hard to put down.  It is not often one can buy a novel and end up with a reference book when the story is finished.
B00C27LB20|5.0|Where did this kid come from. Wow! A energetic and fun listen. I would recommend you give a listen to this newcomer.
067144901X|3.0|We bought this book because our daughter loved &#34;Red Hat Blue Hat&#34; which is also written by Sandra Boynton.  Unfortunately, this book was not as fun to read.  It is still a good read for 8 months-2 years, but not even on the same level of &#34;Red Hat Blue Hat.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Thank you amazon for making this app! at first my cosine started playing with it then I try it and I like it!<br />thank you<br />Morgan
B005DESVPO|5.0|Gary Clark Jr. has proven to be a musician with extraordinary talent. He has the ability to pull you into each song easily. Can't wait to get the full album.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The only camera on the Kindle Fire HD points at the reader.  I want to take pictures of I things I see and not me, I see enough of that in the mirror.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Kid was incredible, surprised he didn't die of hypothermia making the movie. Special effects awesomely appropriate for a change. These were the lucky one's, 250000 weren't so lucky.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it is sooooooooo fun you get to play with yourn friends and guess what the word is if you like pictionary you will like this app
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Great easy listening with a bit o' grit.  He still has the vibe.  Great for being with the one you love.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|In this book, the off again, on again relationship between Christian and Ana brought out the personalities of these volatile lovers.  It is so obvious that they are falling in love with each other but, sometimes it seems they both want to send the relationship to a flaming death.<br /><br />The never ending sex became a bit tiring, at times but, that didn't deter me.  On to Fifty Shades Freed.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Enjoyed this onevery much,kept me on my toes. Would recommend it to every one. I like this Bondvery much. Great.
B000FCJZ4K|3.0|This book is a decent read, and fairly quick.  For those who are very introverted or socially awkward, it may be useful simply for laying down good rules of thumb for how to maximize your interactions. Many readers, though, may find the content obvious.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is worth the money only thing about is there's like literally no diamonds  plus multiplayer I'm not sure if it out if not can't wait for it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It keeps me busy and is seriously addictive. But it is fun and I can earn money for my kids to spend
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Would reccomend this for anyone, but expecially those who love the BBC.  This is a totally engaging series with great characters in a beautiful place. The costumes alone are fantastic
B000TU16GS|5.0|Amazing Book. It's full of mystery and adventure, I recommend this book for al that love adventure and mystery books
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Loved this movie...Hysterical...First movie I have ever seen with Justin Timberlake and his co-star was absolutely the best for her role..
0307352153|3.0|Used a lot of words to get to the point.  Points well taken good data and history.  Useful information was map resented.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I initially did not think Iwould like it, but washooked after the first episode.  Good character development. Would definitely recommend this series
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The game is simple to use and the kids have spent hours on this.  Not as educational a game as a parent would like but it is OK
B003G4W49C|5.0|Brilliant, Mind Boggling, and one of the best book I have ever read. A must read for everyone before the movie releases later this year!
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|The idea is awesome.  It gets addicting once you get going.  However, it can become difficult to match weapons.  Not in the sense where it is challenging of the mind, but because I go to swipe the screen and it may take 20 swipes before it does what I want.  I'm not sure if this is a design of the game.  It is the only game it happens to me.  I can clean my screen.  My screen doesn't need calibrating.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|characters are still beleavable, brings in characters from previous seasons and continues to develop their characters.  well done. Hope there is Season 4
B003L77FYS|5.0|Getting inside criminal's heads through the eyes of a writer is FUN!  Castle is Fun and the relationship between himself and the lady cop is sweet.  We are collecting this entire series for our video library.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook continues to anger people because of changing privacy settings without people knowing until others tip them off. I am tired of this happening and therefore I seldom use Facebook anymore. I don't have time to constantly visit security settings to see what needs reset because of what Facebook administrators keep messing with.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Not enough levels (82, I believe).  I know 82 sounds like a lot, but some are really short.  It's addicting, an easy game to run through all the levels in no time.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Best one yet.  I can't get Spring Break out of my head!  Looking forward to seeing Darius at Bi-Mart's Willamette Music Festival.  Looking for better seats than I had at Stagecoach ....
B00993I6D2|5.0|My husband watches this movie over and over, but we only have the regular DVD.  He found it on Amazon in HD...  and is now in seventh heaven.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is really fun it is something that keeps me busy i have one of the highest scores i love this game
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|A lot of fun for everyone.  My husband and I play it almost as much as my 5 year old.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game it plays very well!  It is easy to spend a lot of time playing this game.  Addictive!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|It's many years since I first read this book. I have had my kindle a few years now and have long since given this book away, so I decided to get for kindle. I love it as much as the first time I read it and as it has been so long, it's just like the first time. This man is the ultimate story teller and I intend to re-read all of his books
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Uber fun.  Me and my children love it (ages 5 & 7).  It is addicting.  It is also frustrating because when you are stuck there is no way of getting hints on how to solve the level.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's really addictive and fun game. Good excercise for observation power and brain. Each room is has unique challenges which can be solved intuitively.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The semi open nature of the headphones is nice because I can still hear what is going on around me. The highs are very lush and sparkly and the bass is just right. They are also very comfortable. Highly recommended!
B00BMQDM10|5.0|I always enjoy Sophie Kinsellas books. They are easy to read, light hearted and fun with believable characters. Good read.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Uber addicting.  Even my husband loves this game (even though he won't admit it) and he doesn't play many tablet games.  Highly recommend.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great show, if you liked white collar you will enjoy suits!  Season to on prime instant video Amazon? Thank you!
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|...as a long time mountaineer and frequent backpacker technically this book was a bit of a let down. i did however find it inspirational as it gently depicts the challenges and healing we all must experience in life's journey.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Outstanding cast brings two levels of English society to thriving life during wartime. Loved the 1st season and this one progresses characters' lives and lives during wartime. Engaging and absorbing viewing, as usual.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I would pick the most obscure character and Akinator would guess it right.  It would be more impressive if he had a limit to how many questions he had to get it right in.
B000AARKOO|3.0|The case and DVD had someone's name written in permanent marker.  Also, there were significant wear marks on the DVD jacket as well as sticky residue.  The condition of the product was not as advertised.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game.  I feel like a detective while playing.  It's challenging but not super hard. It makes you think.
B002QNTNL6|3.0|It's a cute predictable movie suited for family viewing and a good laugh or two or three and is an okay use of spare time.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have a Nabi.<br /><br />Downloaded it to read ebooks.  I was SO excited.  Got going, downloaded samples, got hooked, went to purchase the full book to continue on and.... the books I wanted were suddenly uncompatable with my device.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app finally takes the sting for us DIYers who may not have industrial carpentry knowledge. I can read a ruler well enough to get down to 64ths, but that's where it stops for me. If I have to add anything with differing fractional values beyond 1/ 4, I'm done. This app has been a major blessing for me and if you do any work around the home, it will be for you also!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I found this book a difficult read. It took me awhile to get through it. The constant change of character monologue was not the easiest to follow. I lost interest several times and went to find something else to read. The reader must have a general world knowledge and understanding of political and war history to follow this book at all. I would not recommend it for children under the age of 15.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Good movie for him and his style and entertaining story line.  Enjoyed the different characters and the acting.  Good movie for spare time.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|I am a fan since very young. The albums I ordered are playing in my car since they have been delivered.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|Funny movie which is very entertaining.  Aside from the fact that I know it'll be cheaper in the stores a week or two from now, I went ahead and bought it on here anyway... the price one pays to get it sooner.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Last book, always been a Bill fan.  Little sad it is over.  However, figured it would end this way.  Wonder if she will ever revisit?
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Well writen with several twists that kept you in suspense. Archer has a talent for understanding all classes of people.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Really fun and addictive its up there with angry birds and plants vs zombies. The whole time travel thing is good too, but I wish you could use super powers for free be it once a day or something other than that, really fun and addictive.
B0001I561E|1.0|While I love this movie, I can't say much for the quality of the DVD I received with this order (low video/picture quality, questionale &#34;seal&#34; and packaging, etc.).  In fact, it was so shotty that I feel like I need to initiate further action, because it totally seems like this was some halfass copy someone made in thier basement or something.  Who knows, maybe Disney switched to a different manufacturer, but I'd never buy from this seller again due to this.
0062014536|5.0|I bought this book for one of my students and she LOVES it. She read the first two books in the series, and I felt bad about not having the last one available for her in my library. So I ordered it here. She received it a few days ago and has been raving about the book since she started reading it.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|very good action movie , exciting with some new twist on old story. The whole family had fun watching this one
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I definitely recommend it for anyone out there. It's also very addicting so.. you're going to have to stay up some nights but it'll be all worth it! :)<br /><br />Great book!
B007XELMO4|3.0|First off, I wanted to love this product as it met many specific needs that I have when traveling with my DSLR's and a fully loaded camera backpack.  My biggest issue is that out of the box this does not work with DSLR cameras that have additional grips/battery packs or pro DSLR's with built in grips.  The annoying thing is that nowhere on the Amazon listing or on www.Cottoncarrier.com product page is this mentioned.  There is a series small photos above the bar code on the back of the box that shows you the two aforementioned camera types and a red X next to each type.  In doing some research (I had to view the instruction sheet on their website to find this information) I found that there is an angled mount that can be used with these cameras but it must be purchased separately ($34.00 for a small piece of metal, washer and a screw, outrageous!) so for my purpose the Strapshot out of the box is unusable.<br /><br />Another issue that I had is integration with the camera backpack.  Many camera backpacks lack any attachment points at the top where the Strapshot support strap is supposed to mount.  If you plan on purchasing one of these be sure that you look at the product photos and your backpack closely to ensure that a modification is not needed to use this.  It comes with a wrist strap that they claim is a $35 value, if you actually purchased the strap for that price you would be disappointed in its value, I will leave it at that.<br /><br />Overall I like the build quality of the product but for its somewhat high price it should have come with more than one screw mount so that it could be used with a variety of camera types.  Also when you remove it from the box and look at the Strapshot it doesn't seem like much for $80.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Each season just gets better and better. Video quality is also very good, no need to pay for HD. The drama and intrigue goes up to a new level!
1451673442|5.0|The Secret, The Power, and The Magic have all been a big help to my life! And to my family and friends.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|I like the fact that you can pick the length of the workout as well as the body part or whole body. The only thing I would suggest they improve on is the transition between moves. I know there is a few second delay but its not enough time to go from the floor to standing and get weights if needed. All in all, I like the variety of exercises day to day and I do feel like I worked out
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey nailed it. What a great story for cheap! One of the best Sci Fi purchases I've made on my Kindle.

B009X2CVXA|5.0|I love how this book unfolds, Kate Morton keep surprises for the very end of the book a great read
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A very good and very true with information like continents,geographical features,and mostly real weapons. AND AN AWESOME BOOK =) bye
B00005RDSM|5.0|This has always been a favourite you just cant beat the classics they are time less and need to be watched over and over
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I love David Bowie. I so looked forward to this his latest take on things. He sees it all. Sadly.
B0088X7YMS|4.0|As a substitute for the live action films in this series, Invasion is not much of an offering (but, beggars can't be choosey).  I am disappointed that CGI was their only option (?), although at this point almost anything will do.  I love this series enough that I will put up with it.  As far as the story goes, it's a bit choppy.  After a few seconds of non-action signifying absolutely nothing, the story coughs up another start: 48 hours earlier.  A rescue mission is called for, quickly followed by a hijacking, then a rogue vessel crawling with bugs is on a direct course to Earth, Paris to be exact (oui-oui, the bugs want a vacation).  The pace is quick, the cast of cartoon characters are impossible to tell apart (even though handy little name tags are attached to each suit), and the action is ridiculously repetitive.  There's a lot of macho posturing, the dialog isn't exactly sterling (\\"do me a favor, don't get killed\\"), and the female characters are depicted either nude or dressed as dominatrixes.  Naturally, nukes are considered as the only possible solution (the all-purpose Sci-fi answer to every infestation).  The CGI isn't stellar; the people look like puppets; facial expressions are limited, and in the case of General/Dr. Carl the psychic, downright creepy.  At best, the artwork is serviceable.<br /><br />If they put out another film like this one, I'd buy it (something is better than nothing).
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Martin continues to not disappoint.  I can hardly wait to begin reading Book 5.  I am anxious to learn what Tyrion and the other characters have been doing.

B0085YOD1A|5.0|I really like this app.  Easy to use and now I know exactly how much life my battery has at a glance.  Would definitely recommend.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|For the most part, I cannot abide Adam Sandler (which automatically calls into question my reason for buying this movie).  Imagine my surprise when I found that I liked, even enjoyed, watching it.  Crazier still, I'm keeping it in my collection to watch again.  I'm even looking forward to Hotel Transylvania 2 when it comes out.<br />True, the story is an aching clich&eacute; but it's cute, at times even endearing.  (These are not traits you'd expect from an Adam Sandler movie.)  The humor is inconsistent (I could have done without the gratuitous fart joke).  The message is that age-old plea for tolerance.  My favorite character was Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi).<br /><br />On the whole, I'd have to say this cartoon was ridiculously sweet................and cute.
B00821OX98|5.0|syfi with  good character development. Another benefit of Amazon Prime  that is definitely worth it Can't wait to start season 2<br />I'm hooked  !!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Such a funny book: the workings of the mind of the scientist with Asbergers who embarks on finding a wife but his project is hijacked by Rosie. Very highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My little brother plays this game all the time. I started to play it as well and it's addictive and hard to put down. It's a game for everyone
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I don't understand how this movie could have been nominated for awards. Gore and profanity were it's main point despite it's very important subject.
B003ZLV8T8|4.0|I wanted to watch this movie for I read the book. It kept pretty close to the book though it had some minor differences which did not detract from it. It was well done and an enjoyable movie to watch .  Good performances by the actors and well executed directing made this a good one
B004VFN7BE|5.0|I love this movie.  It has the suspense of a Hitchcock movie with some film noir elements.  No one is safe in this nail biter.  If you haven't seen this one and you love suspense; you will not be disappointed.
B004M2305O|5.0|I highly recommend reading Steveacoustic's well-written assessment.<br /><br />The full series never aired in the U.S., and I doubt that it would have been successful here. There was, however, a television movie entitled, \\"Escape from Colditz\\", that was developed from the series and aired in the U.S.<br /><br />\\"Colditz\\" deserves a five-star rating. \\"Colditz\\" was filmed during the early 70's, when there were few special effects, and great series had to rely on a well-developed, cohesive storyline. \\"Colditz\\" delivered on the storyline, told through intelligent scripts and excellent ensemble performances.<br /><br />While I enjoy the entire series, my favorite episodes begin with first season's \\"Maximum Security\\", when the primary cast had been assembled. I particularly enjoy the second season episodes, with the on-going war of wits and wills between Flt. Lt. Carter, the \\"Escape Officer\\" (portrayed by David McCallum), and Major Mohn (Anthony Valentine) woven through the storyline.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is the first book I've read by Flynn. I won't be reading another one. I loved the premise: big city girl coerced by her husband into moving to a small, nothing-going-on, midwestern town, comes up missing--whodunit? I went in and out of caring about Flynn's characters--they are types and superficial, at best. The book is plot driven, and the plot isn't a bad one. But it reads more like a  movie idea--probably what Flynn had in mind. By the end, which was a cop-out to say the least, I didn't care one iota about the main character, Amy, and the husband, Nick, just gave up, threw in the towel, which seemed counter to his character (had the author presented Nick's want for a child in greater detail in the book, or his selflessness, I might have believed the ending. But Nick was selfish just like Amy, so the ending was underwritten and underdeveloped (like a movie)). When the book ended--I downloaded it on my iPad--I thought there were pages missing. I read it twice thinking I had missed something. Nope.<br /><br />No Great American Novel here--just a simple diversion for the weekend to keep you from mowing the grass.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|They say your game is to old and needs to be updated but when you go to update you can't figure out how so am I missing something or what . it's on my kindle fire the new one.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great entertaining movie. I don't think I heard anyone complain about this movie. All the characters are back (with exception of norton) but he really missed out, to save the world. Honestly it is pointless to try and convence you to see this movie. If you are a fan of the comics you will love it, if you are a fan of the other hero movies you will love it, if you like action movies you will love it, if you love cinema in general it's for you. Get with rest of the planet and own/watch this movie
B005XN31LY|5.0|My 24 year old daughter hooked me on this show. Great characters and actors. It is always fun to see who the next &#34;storybook&#34; character will be in real life.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Found her by accident on Pandora, been in love with her music ever since. Great album, I don't think there is a single song I don't like!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I had a lot of fun to build it and I Play with it a lot with my brother it's really cool
0307346617|5.0|I read it a year ago and I am nervous of the movie about to come out. The book is a series of interviews and eye witness accounts of a post world after surviving a zombie attack. Everything from the first patient, epic battles, way of life, and survival are included in this book. It very well written and entertaining. It was and still is one of the hardest books to put down. While I was reading I was think I never thought of that but that makes sense. Much like the Lincoln the Vampire Hunter was an epic book, but a terrible movie this movie is already send up read flags. First it's PG-13...a zombie movie? Really how do you make a zombie movie PG-13, in the book the zombies are slow moving/dissolving flesh much like walking dead zombies, but in the movie they look like 28 Days Later zombies running like crazy, and 3rd it focuses of one central character and not several different view points...I know you are thinking &#34;what a nerd&#34; but these are core things that really affect the story. That being said they will get my money, but I recommend you reading this first.
B008220D7S|4.0|If your looking for a movie that is actually funny, than you should buy this movie.  This movie was freaking awesome.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|Just not very good at all, it was a nice attempt at a reboot, but just couldn't keep our interest.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseni at his very best!! I do hope he continues to write yet another amazing book next year!<br />Nina B. Radi
B0058YPL66|5.0|Great show that entangles classic fairy tail characters in our modern magicless world. You find yourself pulling for characters and it throws Lost references in every now and again...if you obsessed over that show and pay close attention. Great cast and drama.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love the first episode Season 1. The show is amazing & interesting. I would love to watch the whole episode of Season 1, 2 & 3.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a very fun game, but sometimes it lags and gets annoying because during the lag if you happen to die then you lose all the progress you've made thus far.
B00A3T5CGU|2.0|it is too difficult to deal witn this app.<br />It have limited maps and instructions,<br />I can get something better for free..
B008NW67IQ|4.0|A lot of people have had problems with this album. &#34;It isn't as good as their first&#34; or &#34;it all sounds the same&#34;. The 1st album was unexpected so it is hard to compare something you weren't expecting to something you had a general idea of how it should sound. Some of the banjo rifts do start to run together/sound the same but overall a solid follow up to their debut album. And the ladies love them
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart is Magic whatever he does, his Respect of his family, his little boy cheeky grin, his voice has changed over the years and has adapted perfectly to each stage, this album reflects back to his Smiler album in some ways, his folk/soul side is charisma I could bottle up, Thanks rod love it!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game kept me entertained for awhile thought some of the levels were tricky but I just had to find out how to beat them couldn't quit.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Awesome!<br />Solving the mysteries,getting the rewards something new everytime.enjoying the game  is just awesome that's all. People will enjoy its very good.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Its one of those you love it or hate it...in my mind its a great movie! If you haven't seen it I would give it a shot. Survival is the name of the game. You will find yourself saying what an idiot I would have a house and fire by this point, but it really gives you a good view of an everyday man trying to survive.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great game to play, fun and easily understood. I don't normally like to play games that you have to battle other players but I have enjoyed it very much thus far. You get to farm , create weapons and potions and battle .Like I said great game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. I can not figure out how to upgrade it though. If anybody knows please let me know by commenting another review thx
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game just only 8 levels.  The game is a real thinking game.  If you are easily aggravated by puzzle games this is not the game for you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The beginning of the book starts out a little slow but then hold on. There are so many twists and turns that you won't be able to put this book down. The story was reminiscent of a couple of sensational police cases that made the news. I'm an avid reader, especially of suspense novels, and I don't think I've read a book that had me guessing so much as to what would happen next. I highly recommend this book and it's author Gillian Flynn...this is only her third book and I could see it being made into a movie. I'm now reading her &#34;Dark Places&#34;  and so far so good.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob was an excellent read.  It kept the suspense, and you got to really know and like the characters.  The ending stunned me, but it was a perfect way to end it.  You can't go wrong with Mr. Landay's book, read it!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Such a fun  game to play when you don't have to stress your eyes like some of the other games have you do. Would recommend to most ages..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very cool.  You have to really we your head to figure out some not the clues! Can't wait for more levels
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great series, loved it.  Glad I took the time to watch it.  Sometimes there is no need for TV just a good PC.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My 5 year old picked this game and LOVES it.  She plays it every time she gets &#34;Kindle Time.&#34; Great game!!  No trouble downloading this game.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|i would remand this book for people who don't know ENGLISH!!!!!!!!!!!! ONE DIRECTION BOOKS ARE BETTER THAN A DICTIONARY and THE WANTED IS AWESOME TO
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was not sure where this story was a going but it kept my attention for sure ... Wow is all I can say . Can't wait for the next book
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I always enjoy anything that David Baldacchi writes.  Fast moving, keeps your interest and always entertaining.  Have to finish what I am reading now to get the next Baldacci
B002CNK1MK|5.0|dustin Hoffman got the credit.  I think Tom Cruise was fantastic.  Both were great in this movie.  I have seen it a number of times.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. Its fun, easy, and free. There are no adds that pop up, and no glitch with this game.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|We saw this movie in theaters and loved it.  I love it more than the book.<br />I gave the dvd copy to my mom, she was engrossed.  The disk played well.<br /><br />My husband and I watched the Blu-ray copy today.  The sound did not play properly at first.<br />Hubby dug into the settings in the menu of the disk and discovered that the English version of this on the Blu-ray was set up only as Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.<br /><br />The French and Spanish versions on the disk offered Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound OR Stereo, so when we chose Stereo French it played and sounded great!<br /><br />He was able to use the menu settings on our Blu-ray player to tell that machine to down-mix the Dolby 5.1 input to play properly through our speakers.  I'm lucky I have a tech-savy, patient guy to figure this out, because I would have been frustrated and baffled.<br /><br />Anyways, once he figured out the sound work-around, all was well.  I do recommend this movie very very highly!  You will be amazed when you watch the credits and see how the same actors played so many roles with outstanding makeup, wig, and costume variations.  It's just incredible.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I really like this cover. It makes me feel that my kindle is more secure when I pack it or carry it with me.  I like the color and how it becomes its own stand.  For me it makes reading easier.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|As a christian, I found the account given by Dr. Eben to be in conflict with the writings of Paul and the gospel writers. His account does not include Christ the One that redeemed us from sin enabling us to enter heaven.  It also seems illogical to me that &#34;freedom of choice&#34; is necessary if everyone is going to Heaven anyway.  Why would a God of love need us to experience&#34;evil&#34; if we all end up the same way, in the same place? Where isthe choice?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the Hunger Games. I was so good. I always left a cliff hanger and I did not know if Katnisss and Peeta would make it. I loved it.
1594204217|3.0|This book started off well for me, but then I just couldn't get through it.  I enjoyed the start of the 'fire' section on BBQ, but then skipped ahead to 'water' (soups, etc.)  And then I gave up and gave it to a friend who wanted to read it.  I was hoping for more personal stories early on, and more emotional interest and 1st person point of view.  But Pollan gets more caught up in telling you history and other people's stories than his own, and I had trouble staying invested in where he was going.  If you like his other writing, you'll probably enjoy this.  I've had trouble staying interested in Omnivore's Dilemma and never finished that either, so maybe it's just me.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I was very curious to see if the novel would translate into a comprehensible movie.  It did!  Honestly, I think that I liked the movie better than the novel, which is a rare occurrence.<br /><br />The movie is long, but well worth the effort.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|This is a great series, I can't explain it. Same guy who created Six Feet Under does this. There are just so many great characters, dialog and twisted plot lines. NOT FOR KIDS!  A lot of sex and violence but it a works.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent in a fold out format that won't scratch the discs. Get it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun and easy great for passing time<br />Simple layout simple controls and simply fun<br />I would and do recommend this game
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next books in the series.  Good story with several<br />areas that spur the important question; Is that possible, probable?
B008OM0EDO|5.0|This is probably one of the movies where I actually laughed out loud in and is probably the best Cohen movie out of the three also even though it was staged. You must realize the sort of humor it involves before giving it such a bad review. Either way...it is definitely under-rated and should be given a try.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I've never left a review, but this book inspired me to return to the mind I had when I was younger, but with the experience of the years I have. Between the two, and time to let ideas bubble to the surface, I am not making any claims to genius, but a mind that is more interesting to live in is no small feat. Thank you.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|This is a great movie in the long string of Allen productions on the meaning of life (or lack thereof) and soul searching. In my view the main point can be summarized as follows: can only unfulfilled love be romantic? Is complete, fulfilling love destined to inevitable demise? Intriguing if somewhat disconcerting. We all look for love, and there is inescapable tension in the process. That is what produces romance. Once we get there, things start to turn routine, normal, and the spark is killed. That was not the plan of course, but what was the plan? What is is that we want from life? Do we need to know? Does it matter? Not really, Allen seems to suggest. \\"Whatever works\\", the title of a previous great movie, is good for us. Better to take advantage of what life has to offer and go for it. Avoid falling into easy comfortable traps, like money and an established, conformist lifestyle, because that makes for a boring life.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Characters are just not likeable - they deserve each other!!<br />Well written, but not entertaining.  Waded through to the end, but it was a chore.
B005544V6A|5.0|Season one was the best! Season 2 very good. It will get you hooked, can't wait till Season 3 starts.
0345803485|5.0|my thanks to e l james , she held my intrest and my heart , i read all 3 books 4 times ,great love story, i do hope she writes more wonderful love stories .
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My 6 and 7 year old daughters love this game. It is a fun time killer for long car rides. Keeps them quiet and entertained in the backseat while I'm paying attention to the road.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|cool I love hove u can see all ur thing in stand going to the Internet and put new pictures and thing u feel
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I'm hooked, I thought I liked season 1 better, some the story lines in 2 drug on, but it's fantastic. Love the characters and actors. So worth the time.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|Excellent film! The crash between 2 cultures is hilarious at times, but dramatic and tragic at others. The director takes us to a journey of people that apparently don't have any connections between them, but in the end find out they have more in common than what they thought.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|I am very happy with the sender of this movie. I received this movie at a much earlier time than I expected and at a very decent price. I will definitely use this seller again in the future.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game keeps you interested. The ways in which the clues were hidden kept me from getting bored. The game is too short.
B0084670FU|2.0|Another classic example of screenwriters/directors taking &#34;advantage&#34; of their creative liberties, waisting the our time, hoping at some point there is going to be a profound point to their &#34;message&#34;.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|This is well written and is a good introduction to the characters of the trilogy.  It's a bit light on plot but this is made up for in the second of the trilogy.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Not at all what I thought it was going to be like. Expected something much better than what this movie is.
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|A movie made for children as it goes way beyond any rational thought process and yet we have to add the R rating potion because it's so very important to see a naked woman in a children's classic. Wait what were we thinking as removing the naked does not even one iota distract from the movie. Could not connect with main characters as they appeared to cardboard like. Recommend if this is your kind of movie and you are an adult \\"True Blood\\" should satisfy you.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like the game at first, but once I got used to the controls and all it became so much fun. I literally play it every single day. I love it!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Have long been a fan of Rod Stewart.  The songs are great and all tell a story.  An added bonus that he wrote all but one.
B008602KQI|4.0|Kept me watching, good story line that keeps you wanting more. I'd watch it again and looking forward to seeing the next one.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love this game. today when I started playing, however, it went at light speed when I first started out. please help to find a way to fix this.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|nice production values, fresh storyline, solid performances from talented cast- even location (onatio) seems fresh - vancover/toronto watch out.....what else could a girl ask for?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Really enjoyed this third book from Khaled Hosseini. Easy to read and I loved how all the stories came together at the end. Great summer read.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game really is a good game for those who like mysteries and enjoy looking for clues and completing quests
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the BEST game i've ever gotten on my kindle. i'm seriously addicted to it. trust me, its addicting.!!! (:
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have been a huge fan of Ms. Day for years but I think I'm done. Did she run the idea of making this more than a trilogy past her reading group before she released this book? If she did, she needs a new reading group because they clearly do NOT reflect a cross section of her readers. And, if her editors and publishers talked her into this, she should stop writing immediately because she is no longer doing it for the love of writing but for the profits it entails. Very disappointed.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Very well written.  They keep the series fresh with new characters.  Characters continue to grow, but they don't change so much that you wonder what the writers were thinking.  All said...in the end Sheldon MAKES the show a hit.
B00821OX98|4.0|Enjoyable alien invasion series...nice twists and suspense moments. Effects are good and aliens are well done. Season two is even bettet.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show about family/ family problems, a women getting back into working and most important about interesting law cases. I enjoy watching it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a nice game, i give them that. However, so far there is no plot. Granted, I'm not very far into the game but so far there has been little plot, just me completing quests for various mansion characters. Also, the game is purely hidden pictures. Nothing more, nothing less. There are different ways to the pictures besides just being given a list and a set. So there is a little variety....<br />  But the game also malfunctions, while trying to play the screen froze and wouldn't let do anything but click on some wandering creature and pay money it to go away, two seconds later its back asking me to pay more game coins to get rid of it. Secondly when i try to close the game 60% of the time the game music continues to play even though i want to leave, turning my kindle(fire HD) off doesn't even help, the back ground music continues to to play. Nothing major, purely annoying. Also, when I'm done playing, (and shut off the music) my device tends to be sluggish and work not quite properly.<br />  In conclusion, its a cute time waster that so far is truely free. Download if you like hidden pictures and pretty graphics. Happy playing!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I loved this game I even purchased the upgrade and it was totally worth it and you  still play and have fun without the upgrade the only bad thing is that I bought the upgrade and it said that I would remove the pop up ads but It didn't so if you get the upgrade just for no ads DON'T. Otherwise it's a great game.
B002WJI66C|4.0|The boo was awesome but i was hoping that it had a loop to hang it up but still a cool item
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is addicting and I think that it is a great book for kids that are ages 10+. Have fun reading this book!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have so many highlights in this book. It is full of great insight!<br /><br />I will read this again and again!! I recommend this book to people of all ages!  I am a slow reader and it took me about a month to finish.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I love this movie! I read the book before I watched this and was very pleased to see how close it was to the movie (as close as a movie can be to the book). I have watched this several times already! I would definitely recommend reading the book, but you really don't miss too many details if you stick to just the movie.<br /><br />If you love romantic comedies and zombies, this is the movie/book for you!
B000V39KDO|5.0|great price, very happy with it, just as described. I would order from again.  Thanks again, im very pleased, thanks
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think that this game has a lot of action in it that makes it exciting.The thing that I hats about it is all the diamonds and coins you have to earn to get things
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Clever, enjoyable, funny. Loved the voice talent. Sweet storyline. (I also liked Shrek I, Tangled, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Incredibles) Just so you know, if you liked the listed movies, you will likely enjoy this one. If not, then maybe animated features aren't for you!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|What a really good movie, I can't wait til they make part two. This is a must see movie and action packed.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This film was difficult to watch and was an effort to remain focused. I should have read the reviews first as it is another 2 ½ hours of my life that I will never get back. I expected a more historic view of Lincoln's life, the civil war, and his impacts to the Union. Sad move....stay away and save your $.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Wyatt Earp is a well acted , well directed movie. Costner played earp better then fonda did In my darling clementime.or lancaster gunfight at the o k corral.  Russell was good in tombstone but the movie went a liile overboard.. Wyatt earp is a excellent movie about the life of earp . I have the 2 disc dvd set, and the wide screen vhs with the deleted scenes add bsck into the film. I wish that stuido would do that on the blu ray. So if you want a great western get Wyatt Earp.
B002M87W9K|5.0|I love Robert Preston. Great catchy tunes. Classic. What's not to love? Also, now that it's in my library, I can watch it any time I want with a wifi connection.
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|Cute monkey.  James Franco not at his best here.  Michelle Williams superb as always.  I don't think it's possible to make Mila Kunis appear ugly or scarey.  Not much for Rachel Weisz to do.
B000L53D4O|5.0|It will be highly useful in the leisure home environment that will allow me to help my granddaughter explore the walking and learning opportunity in this area.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Clever, enjoyable, funny. Loved the voice talent. Adored the voice work of 'Kenny' from 30rock (Jack McBrayer), John C. Riley of 'Chicago' fame.<br />Imaginative storyline. Nice surprise twist at the end. (I also liked Shrek I, Tangled, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Hotel Transylvania) Just so you know, if you liked the listed movies, you will likely enjoy this one. If not, then maybe animated features still aren't for you!
B00942V1J4|5.0|Love this and watch all the time. I have never seen a better movie and great actors. So much love between Edward and Bella that it wasn't acting it was real. They will love for ever.
1615470158|5.0|It will be highly useful in he workspace once I find employment opportunities that will allow me to train in this area.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Hubby liked it much better than I did... it was his turn to pick this time! He compared it to Old School and the Hangover. He would have given it 4.5 stars. Just depends on your taste in films. As a chick, I was unconvinced that the girlfriend would really put up with that much!! I did thoroughly enjoy Seth McFarland's voice work though.
B00942Y94I|5.0|Love this and watch all the time. I have never seen a better movie and great actors. So much love between Edward and Bella that it wasn't acting it was real. They will love for ever.
B000002JBG|5.0|It will be highly useful in the home for children interested in leisure entertainment around this sport event for an activity.
B004Q3UL56|5.0|We are also great fans of Anne Hathaway. She did a beautiful job in this movie. Hubby additionally liked the bare breast scene! I'd say this one would be categorized as a &#34;chick flick&#34;. It was my turn to pick!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the characters and story. It keeps you thinking, wondering what will happen next. The characters are hilarious, just a great show all around.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|A good thriller.  Liked the characters.  This was the kind of book that is hard to put down.  I would recommend it to friends that like political thrillers.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is the favorite movie for my 4 year old and I to watch together. It is a classic gem of a movie already, and the blu ray just makes it that much more breathtaking.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This is a fun game and is very challenging.  A Fruit Ninja game with based on the Puss in Boots theme, this game is worth getting if you like Fruit Ninja because the play modes are different.  Even little children can play this game because it is not difficult to understand.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I liked it.  It was a easy fun no brainer.  Wanted to know what was going to happen throughout.  Good beach book.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This story helps document events of a sunami that occured while a family was vacationing at a resort.  The way they found each other after the disaster is remarkable.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love the Fruit Ninja games.  They are easy to learn to play but challenging and can keep even small children entertained.  You need quick reflexes to slice all the fruit but it sure is fun to try.  Definitely get this game.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|My mother in law said this was a &#34;must read&#34;, it's not.  It was fine but I was bored through most of it.  Ending was too predictable.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I much prefer the good old fashioned horror movies where the monster is clearly defined.  This one is all over the map with some truly scary scenes, but it seems they tried too hard to make the movie twist and turn.  It became almost tedious to follow.  The special effects were good.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This is another Gameloft game that gets mixed reviews.  Good graphics, nice storyline, but impossible to progress through the levels without in app purchases.  I also play Ice Age Village, which has the same concept.  Ice Age Village allows you to progress much faster through the levels without purchasing extras.  In Ice Age Village you can earn the coins pretty quickly.  In this game, coins run out very quickly and are slow to regenerate.  Also, to get other animals for the zoo you have to go out and rescue them.  That would be fun but you run out of fuel very quickly and must return to the reserve, unless you use your precious gems, which cost money to purchase.  Also, the reward for completing the safaris is very small in regard to the amount you spend, so you really get nowhere fast in this game.  Again, if you could build reserves more quickly, this game would be better rated.  As it is, it is too slow and frustrating.  I don't mind waiting for reserves to build, but it can take days and days in this game.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I liked this book but it was a bit morbid and depressing.  I didn't care for the ending.  If you liked Gone Girl, you'll probably like this one too.  I was interested throughout and wanted to know what was going to happen but at the end, felt disappointed.  Good read if you have nothing else or are on a trip/plane.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This was my first app for these kind of puzzles. I like that you can choose the number of pieces in the puzzle.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Very nice game.  Well done graphics.  Beautiful.  This game is fun.  If you love horses and/or sim games, this is the perfect game for you.  It is easy to understand the game play and there are good challenges.  I love the competitions.  And it's fun to play the minigames.  Money, health, love and experience are gathered easily and you can play this game for a very long time without in app purchases. Though they are available and would enhance the gameplay, they are not necessary.  I would recommend this game, particularly for anyone that loves horses.<br /><br />EDIT --- Initially I loved this game. Then I hit level 10. After that ads started popping up. Not just an ad when I started the game but everytime I do something. An ad after every mini game. An ad after every visit another player. An ad after doing anything. And sometimes there is an ad on top of an ad. I understand the need for ads to help pay for free games but on the my horse website it say the ads are only for those that don't make in app purchases. I made a purchase and I still get ads. I also don't mind a few ads here and there but this game is now almost unplayable because of all the ads.  Please fix and I will be glad to change this back to my original review.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I love this app, but I cant take the ads on the videos piss me off, they're just right in the middle of screen, plz move the ads.
B00BKTFABE|3.0|Guess I should have known.  Since my Kindle has no viewfinder for pictures, I guess I shouldn't have expected quality good enough for my MasterPaintings Etsy account.  I mean, when I aim right, the pix are decent enough--but not for the quality I need for Etsy and Ebay.<br /><br />If small size pictures for sending through email is what you want, then this app will be fine for you.
0307594165|5.0|Sometimes for me, Toni Morrison is a little too heavy with the weightiness of her writing. By that I mean it is like 'work' to get through her novels. The rewards are immeasurable, but it is 'work'.<br /><br />'Home' has a simplicity about it. It takes no time to get a feel for the main character and understand the circumstances that tempered his disposition. Highly recommended.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is now my most favorite movie...it is excellent!!!My family balked at the subtitles, but once the film started they were mesmerized!!!!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It is another fun version of Angry birds, and it is fun to see how good your friends are at it as well.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I purchased this movie based on the review of another purchaser.  My 4 year grand-daughter did not request the movie, but once she viewed it, wanted to watch it repeatedly.  She even sings the songs when the movie is not playing.  The package was delivered in good stead and on time.
B0062YADWI|4.0|This is a nice tool to have in the key chain. I use my leatherman wave all the time. This, not so much. It is tough.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|very good quality good movie to<br />a little over price but good I rent movies from amazon all the time never have problems streaming them
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not your every day story in not your every day format. Extremely easy to read with plenty of &#34;twists and turns&#34;. The characters are extremely well developed and Flynn really has a strong grip on human psyche and relationships in the modern world. Definitely a compelling book that shouldn't be missed!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|a delicate and difficult subject, tastefully handled, well acted, thought provoking, Liked it very much, will probably watch it again.
B007V9N5R8|5.0|I'm a serious-amateur-recently-turned-pro photographer, and had reached the point when I realized monitor calibration was now a necessity.  I deliberated between the Spyder line and this one--as most of the photographers I knew owned Spyders, I was leaning that way, until I realized that the model I was considering was limited to calibration of one monitor only.  As I have two workspaces for photo editing, this decided me for the ColorMunki.<br /><br />Initially a little nervous given a few reviews I read stating that setup was complicated and support limited, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this thing was to set up.  There are two installation disks--one for the color checker passport, and one for the monitor calibrator.  For the color checker passport, you simply take a photo of the passport at the start of a shoot, then when you get home, copy that file as a DNG and run the color checker passport wizard.  Upon analysis, the system creates a color profile for loading into LR or PS (and probably others too--I'm only a user of those editing products).  When the photos are imported into your editing software, you select that color profile to edit with, and you can be confident your colors are accurate.  The color checker passport was MIND BLOWING to me.  I mainly shoot on auto WB to avoid button-fiddling while chasing small children, and rely on post processing in LR to correct.  I decided to use the WB card on the color checker passport for a recent session, though, and was stunned at the difference.  Switching between auto WB (as shot), the Daylight setting I would previously have used in post processing, and a custom WB based on my color checker passport, and the difference was noticeable.  Now, the Daylight WB would still have made for pretty good pictures, but they turned out just THAT much better using the card.<br /><br />The monitor calibration was similarly simple to use.  The wizard runs, and takes you through exactly what you are to do and when, and the result is a perfectly calibrated monitor.  The unit itself sits beside your computer, measuring the ambient light at user-defined intervals, to ensure that you are always editing on a screen that reflects accurate colors, regardless of the change in ambient light.  I LOVE this feature, as it had never previously occurred to me that ambient light would affect my editing that much.  The system also periodically checks, at user defined intervals, that your monitor calibration is up to date, which makes for a handy little reminder.<br /><br />I'm only a few days into use of this thing, so I'm still keeping an eye out for surprises, but overall, I am VERY pleased.  The ColorMunki was only a tiny bit more expensive than the Spyder unit I was considering, and given the inclusion of the color checker passport and multiple monitor calibration, it made for a much better deal.  I have yet to order prints since using this unit, but I did run a test print on a (admittedly cheap) photo printer that we have, and the colors looked great.<br /><br />If my opinion of this unit changes, I'll update this review, but otherwise--BUY IT!<br /><br />*Update: I have since ordered prints from two different photo labs, with no color correction, and the colors are SPOT ON.

B00A8MGIZG|1.0|The whole premise of the movie is about a person having past lives with the premise that in the next one mistakes won't be repeated.  The movie shifts from one reincarnation to the other rapidly and doesn't tie each one together all that well.  Hanks plays several characters and not convincingly.  This is not a good role for Barry although she is better than Hanks.  Often the words are garbled by Hanks so you can't understand what he is saying, especially at the beginning of the movie.  The premise is just not plausible unless, of course, one believes in that stuff.  Not much action and the plots for each life are not worth the trouble.  Don't purchase this one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|If you love pinterest as much as I do, you'll love this app! But be careful....pinterest on your laptop is a real time killer, but having it portable takes it to a whole new level - haha! It does run a little show at times, but I think that's just how pinterest is as it does that on the computer sometimes as well. I've never had and issues with it crashing or anything like that as I have with quite a few free apps.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A unique offering which is only marred by Rothfuss' delay in the final novel of the series.  Hopefully it will come soon.
B007SGM084|5.0|I just love this trilogy. I only wish that she would finish what she started at the end and continue the series by writing them in Christians view point. I would love to be able to see what Christian was thinking through the series.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Cloud Atlas was a waste of time and money.  Several scenes were very offensive and the story had way too many loose ends.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Awesome acting, it was just great. The sun plays such an important role,,its like the protagonist and antagonist at the same time. I loved this movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Yeah it's a good game easy to understand, nothing too frustrating and its kind of nice to play a game without hating it halfway through.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Awesome. Good sense of comedy with a nice mix of lore in it. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was browsing Netflix and Amazon Instant for a new show. I couldn't find anything for a couple of days that really sparked my interest.<br /><br />Then I stumbled upon &#34;Fringe,&#34; watched the Pilot episode and sat stunned into silence. This show was made for me. I can't imagine how many others are out there that feel the same way!<br /><br />I've only gotten through most of Season 1 but I will most definitely be following to the end.<br /><br />There's just enough: Sci Fi, drama, action and FBI mixed together to make an impressing mix. Not too much Sci Fi to scare me away though. It was done very well!
B001E7OO2I|5.0|i have become a fan since my coworker introduced me to john legend.  music is great for ambient listening or active listening
B0039O8AQK|1.0|This has to be a low budget  film.  I am almost embarrassed to say my husband and I quit the movie after about 45 minutes of painful watching.  I can't tell you what it's about.  All the outside takes appeared to be taken on the same street corner littered with the same war worn torn debris of bricks, glass, and bombed out cars.  An appearance of an underdeveloped country that goes on living among the debris.  The first 45 minutes centered around this one man...I can't even tell you his name.  The sound was recorded with a great echo in the beginning that made it hard for us to understand what was being said...perhaps someone else would have no trouble.  The plot was not clear by the 45 minutes.  Obviously everyone was being watched at all times and some of those times even through a monitor to make sure you exercised properly...a 1:1 conversation with the watcher.  I may say that Nazi Germany in all it's horrors seemed almost civilized as compared to this film, although there were not any violent scenes in this movie in the first 45 minutes.  People mumbled to one another as thought they may be overheard and again, it was difficult to hear, even with volume turned up.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a great game. I liked it a lot. This gavme really entertaines you if your's bored. Get it but it can be better.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. I love the idea and I love big end of the world type books,but This one just seemed repeative to me. I had to make myself read the last bit of it because I hate leaving a story unfinished. With so many good reviews I wouldnt discourage anyone from reading it but try a sample first and see how you like the story flow.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I used to have this movie and I lent it to someone who decided to make t a part of their library, I suppose.  Anyway, years later I came across this while looking for other documentaries about the Great Depression and I decided to once again own it.<br />A great film.  Not a documentary, but a movie with a VERY young Henry Fonda. A black and white film about a man going through the great depression.  Good to watch for those of us interested in that era .
B000OJFV4C|5.0|It was very interesting.  I learned a lot about the time period.  It goes to show you human nature is the same wherever and whenever.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really good. Lets you know to the minute how long you have left for anything you may do. Ie reading, watching videos whatever. I rate it 10/10.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Neat, easy to use for simple math.  Recommended for anyone needing a calculator for their tablet.  You'll like it a lot.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|A bit dramatic. Not as good as the 1st, but better than the 2nd! I'm assuming theres a 4th coming out?!!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It's the best game ever! Must get it!  It's all worth it! I have no reason not to get this game! It's just to awesome!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this version of Solitaire for my Kindle Fire.  Really appreciate the auto-complete at the end of the game and the attractive playing surface with options to tweak it for different looks.  Thanks for an excellent free product Mobilityware - I'll definitely be looking for more!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|For the majority of book, I kept thinking how cute it was, and I wondered if I was in fact reading a book for teenagers, as it wasn't challenging me to the slightest. It wasn't until the end when I realised that I had accumulated quite a special bond with not only Charlie but with all the individual characters and that the book covered many deep themes. The questions that were raised at the end were very good as well.
B001QURA7E|5.0|this music takes me back to the hours I spent listening to my stereo when I was a teen.  good times
B002C949KE|5.0|Insightful, funny, and provocative. This books makes you realize how irrational we may be even when we think we are being rational.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any person interested in psychology, economics/finance, marketing or that just one to read a good book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely looooved this book. Drew is a piece of work, but in the end I was sooo rooting for him. The Thanksgiving dinner had me laughing out loud, and some of the things he tells his niece are priceless. Can`t wait for the next one from this author.
B001EBWING|5.0|This is one of the best all time movies. I actually don't know a single person who has watched this and did not love this movie. There really is no sense in describing the details as everyone knows. I only have one issue and these days it seems so immaterial but the leading women is having an affair and is willing to forsake her marriage. It seems that our society has a problem that it did not have in the older days but folks are not committed to marriage, and when I watch these movies I think I understand why.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Enjoyed this book,  so sad to read of the way it was for his family, being so poor.  Sure made him tough and gave him character though.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not as good as the others.I think the storyline is getting thin.  I missed Eric and interaction with the vampire world. It was a quick fun read but the least fun of the series. .
B00COHIFQS|2.0|Having enjoyed Guillermo del Toro's other films I expected something a bit more edgy and visually intriguing. Flimsy plot with little suspense and a lame ending. Can't help but wonder why he would make this film.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|No more problem with this awesome app.  I fall fast asleep with two little tiles.  There is only one solution  for all this is pick your favorite tab/time.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Arrived in great condition and before specified time. Saw this in the movies 3 times at regular price and 3 times at 1.50 movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I see this game as a brain teaser.  Even though It was challenging I really enjoy it. I love how it keeps you wanting more. Cant wait for more levels.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy puzzles and this game fits the bill.  It can be challenging at times but it is a unique twist on puzzle solving.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Good graphics and gameplay and now on sale for a dollar so why not get it unless you are the lizard or Benin
B003TNM2K6|5.0|This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, it is one of my fav orite Stephen King movies!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|There have been dozens of times that I have been on a photo shoot and wanted to look up the solution to a photography question but couldn't because my reference book was at home.  Now I have instant access!!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It was a twist at the end to make it all about Joyce. But how wonderful it liberated her from years of loneliness and trips to the Gap!
1416549447|5.0|ChiRunning, A revolutionary approach to effortless, injury-free running is an amazing book and DVD. Growing up, I played a lot of sports from football to baseball to track, all of which required explosive running or sprints if you will. At age 17 I joined the Army and the distances I ran began to increase. As part of the semi-annual physical fitness test, the Army requires its Soldiers to run 2 miles within a certain amount of time. The morning PT program usually consists of training at much greater distances. When I was young it did not matter, or better put, I did not know any better, nor did I realize that running is an art.<br />When I was in my early twenties I decided I wanted to run a marathon and began to train. Once again, as a youth, I simply went out and ran. After a couple months of training, I discovered the weight room, and stopped running in favor of lifting weights. I had to continue training in order to pass the Army physical fitness test, but that was the extent of my running. As I grew older I put the marathon ambition back on my bucket list. While training I began having problems in my hips and my hamstrings. It became so painful that I went to see the doctor and he referred me to physical therapy. The physical therapist tried everything from stretching to dry needling to try and relieve the pain.<br />In 2010 my unit deployed to Iraq to support the draw down. During this tour I was introduced to a therapist, who was an avid runner. He put me on a treadmill and observed my running. He told me I spent too much time on my heels. I was a heel toe runner who over used the heels of his running shoes. He made some recommendations, and I attempted to make the adjustments, but it wasn't until another Soldier recommended ChiRunning that I really understood what the therapist was talking about.<br />ChiRunning is a book and DVD by Danny and Katherine Dreyer. It has been hailed as an elite source in all sports to include football, baseball, yoga, and of course, the running community. ChiRunning is a step by step plan with instruction and exercises that help you transition from your current style of running to a more proper style that is less prone to injury. The Dreyer's walk you through the techniques necessary to change your current running style. Their overall goal is to relieve stress and tension so you run more like you did when you were a kid. They break down the difference between ChiRunning and Power Running, and they take you through exercises that focus on and help develop the core, which is essential to running properly.<br />From beginning to end the book is a process that will help professionals run better, and enthusiast like myself run more efficiently. It is a process, so be patient, but from the very first lesson you will start realizing things to work on. The DVD is an excellent resource as it helps solidify what is in the book by providing the reader with a visual of the different exercises. After reading the book and perfecting my technique, In the last year I have effortlessly run the Army 10 miler, two half-marathons, 3 adventure runs (dirt/mud runs), and shaved 30 seconds off my Army two mile run time. I also, finally, marked that marathon off my bucket list.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I TRY GETTING IT FREE BUT I CANT!!!I WISH MINECRAFT WAS FREEEE! PLEASE PLEASE IM BEGGING TO MOJONG TO MAKE IT FREEEE!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It took me a while to get it setup but when I did it worked. I only know how to use it if you are on the same network. Haven't figured out how to use it anywhere yet but when I get and hour (or three) to figure it out I will give more of a review.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series pulls at my heart strings just like the others. Passionate and steamy. Can't wait for the last one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My brother got me hooked on this game.  Fun for anyone of any age.  A good brain challenge for seniors.
B001EBWING|5.0|This all time classic never ceases to inspire as a colossal romance. The directors managed to recreate a world so real and vivid that even in black and white the characters and events were complete and vibrant. Cheers to movies like this that tower over the film industry as landmark achievements.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|After 7 years Boards of Canada release the brilliant Tomorrow's Harvest. It is well worth the wait, which is what I WISH I could say about My Bloody Valentine and their release mbv which, after 22 years or so (!)  is a complete waste of their (and our) time. At least I only wasted the 45 minutes it took me to listen to it, they wasted all 22 years on it LMAO
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|this film is a work of art. i seen it on netflix and i had to own a physical copy. great price, great fast shipping.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|This is probably the most comfortable PS3 controller out there. BUT the huge deadzone on the analog sticks renders it basicly useless for us in FPS games. but for anything else it works like a charm
B00BC24NT4|5.0|LeCarre has not lost his touch or his extraordinary writing skills. He has changed his politics however and I appreciate that. This is a fine tome and I took my time reading it for that very reason. I would wish for a more Hollywood ending, but Mr. LeCarre writes for the real world.
B0064X79JC|4.0|It is a great thing to own along with the movie. It is written right to the point, no long boring descriptions. Is similar but different to the movie, you can tell how the film was inspired by this book. shipped super fast and great price.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I have been a huge fan of this series, bought every book the day it was released and watched every episode of the HBO adaptation. I loved the twists in this book but felt it was all rushed to jam it into one 'final' book. Then there's the truly boring and unimaginative ending! I feel like Charlaine just wanted to get the series over with rather than invest in ending the story properly.<br />I only hope she writes spin off books to explore one or two other characters to make up for it!
B00BF123WG|5.0|The directing, writing, and acting were brilliant.  Story well told.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, with the exception of my mother, who hates violence in film.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I didn't want to put it down. I laughed and cried the entire time. Amazing recommend it for everyone. :)
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this is like one of the best games on the kindle its nice and its like when you playing in xbox or playstation
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is great and it will always keep u guessing whats going to happen next. Great book i hope there another book in the making.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|it was hilarious and fun to watch with my friends! I've seen It already, about ten times! sorry not sorry.
B009O2XY12|1.0|It keeps asking us  for money so I uninstalled this app and we will not be playing this one anymore.
B00821OX98|4.0|It starts after the invasion so you kinda have to really watch to pick up on what's going on. A little hard just at first, but keeps getting easier as it goes on. It holds your attention that's for sure.
B00BESM14U|5.0|it's really well put together and sequenced nicely. it's also a very emotional film to watch and I cried whilst watching.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Great read. I COULD truly feel the characters speaking their story through the author. I COULD read this over again and again and still be moved by the harsh realities of antebellum life in the south. My very soul grieves for my people and all the horror we survived. Mama was the true heroine of the book. She was indeed an angel and the glue that held everyone together. Each character suffered in their own way and I for one  could really feel the very pain of their their tragic lives.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Although I enjoyed Khaled's other two books, this one somehow missed the mark for me.  Hard to explain.  Didn't flow.  Too much, not so interesting, detail on minor characters.
B000PC6Z48|1.0|It really amazed me that I could ever have liked a crap movie like that. It shows one how tastes change over time.
1400052181|5.0|I bought this for a school book required for a Masters program, and I have been reading it, and actually love it.  It's interesting, and teaching me at the same time. Good book!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Does the language have to be so crass?<br /><br />It was interesting to learn to what extremes a controlling person will go.<br />Considered both dysfunctional.  Thought it was pathetic he felt he had to stay in the relationship for the sake of the son.
B001NA6096|5.0|I felt as though the actors weren't acting, but were actually living their lives for the two days shown.  Very few movies touch ones emotions as Before Sunrise does.  It took me back to my youth.  I could even envision myself in their shoes because it was so realistic and done so well.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|The imagary of the wolves, the woods, the people and the story we're amazing. I felt as if I were there. I could not put it down.
0425263991|4.0|I just finished Heart of Obsidian. I found it a difficult book to read and even more difficult to review.  The story is very dark.  One of the characters is holding on to his control for most of the story.  There is danger, excitement, suspense, and romance.  The romance is the only thing holding the main character in check.  Love in this story truly saves.  There are a lot of lines crossed and the Psy have to change or disappear.  This is a excellent addition to the Psy-Changeling series.  I would not recommend this as a stand alone book.  Start at the beginning of the series for the most enjoyment.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|I really like the game but gives worst planes they should give the dcs 10 not the crapy plane u start out with worst heli u start with same as the boat

B000FBJAF0|4.0|Like many other reviewers I discovered Forsyth at a young age and was entranced by the first three novels, which he at one time claimed were the only ones he would write (Jackal, Odessa, and Dogs of War). I liked No Comebacks and some of the later novels (Fourth Protocol, The Deceiver) but at some point they began to seem too formulaic and shallow--the charm of the early novels, with their authentic-seeming peeks at exotic sub cultures and the lean narrative style, detached but still with plenty of insight into the human condition--seemed gone. So I haven't bought too many of the Forsyth novels from the last decade or two. I only bought this one to fill a dull weekend when my back was acting up. But I'm glad I did. This is a very entertaining page turner, classic Frederick Forsyth. I'm not sure when it was published--it is set in 2001 with flashbacks to WWII, Vietnam and Bosnia. If you are a fan of the original Forsyth books and not of most of his later stuff, fear not; this one is good.

0307352153|4.0|Review courtesy of www.subtleillumination.com<br /><br />\\"The secret to life is to put yourself in the right lighting. For some, it's a Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamplit desk. Use your natural powers -- of persistence, concentration, and insight -- to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply.\\" - Susan Cain<br /><br />Action. Boldness. Charisma. Harvard Business School and modern society are unanimous on the importance of these values. Not achieving them, therefore, signals failure: that we are too introspective, too reflective, and too contemplative. Susain Cain disagrees, and in Quiet argues that society grossly undervalues introversion. Choosing not to go to the party, or indeed to hide in the bathroom when you're at the party, is not a sign of weakness: rather, it's simply a preference for a life with less external stimulation, a model society might do well to learn from.<br /><br />To understand introversion, she traces it back to childhood. Highly reactive children, ones who respond strongly to stimulus, are actually more likely to be introverts than low reactive children. It is people who find external stimulation overwhelming who therefore seek to limit that stimulation, and so become more inwardly focused. For Cain, it's a biological difference, not disadvantage.<br /><br />Studying fish, she points out that bold fish are more likely to rush into traps and get caught than shy fish, but once in captivity, bold fish start eating the food earlier than shy fish and have a much higher survival rate. For humans, introversion predicts academic success in university better than cognitive ability, and an introvert's focus on reflection means that in the lab they spend longer on tasks and do better at them. A world with less decisiveness and more forethought, therefore, might well be a better world. There is, after all, \\"zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.\\"<br /><br />As befits a bookwritten for introverts, Cain has written a book inspiring both action and reflection. At times it reads as a cheerleader for self-conscious introverts, encouraging them to be proud of their status, but it also relies on theories of learning and child-development to understand possible benefits to introversion and how people develop such traits. Of course, in serving as cheerleader for introversion, her examples of extraverted individuals can sometimes feel caricatured, and her description of introverts can sometimes feel like it includes all possible virtues. A few sections can also feel a bit slow, not contributing much to the thrust of the argument. Still, for any introvert feeling self-conscious in a world of extroverts, the book is a must read.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Richard Linklater is the master of the conversation film.  From his first movie, Slacker, to his more recent creation, Bernie, he has always relied on dialogue to carry his narrative.  For some this is a weakness.  Film is a visual medium, after all.  Linklater's films may not be as visually striking as other auteurs, but in subduing the visual element, he has refocused his narratives on the intimate, often mundane conversations that take place between his characters.  Nowhere in his filmography is this more apparent than Before Sunrise, a romantic film about two couples who meet in Vienna, strike up a half a day's worth of a relationship, and, of course, madly fall in love.<br /><br />The two protagonists of Before Sunrise, Celine and Jessie, first meet on a train as it's pulling into Vienna.  Celine has switched seats to get out of earshot of a bickering couple, and the two strike up a conversation that's unnaturally cut short because Jessie is flying out of Europe tomorrow and Celine is supposed to continue on the train ride.  Both characters are twenty-somethings who are away from home--Jessie is American and Celine is French--but they are well suited conversationalists.  Before getting off the train, Jessie decides to offer Celine an opportunity to spend more time together.  He doesn't have any extra money, so he was planning on just walking around the city all day and all night until it is time to head to the airport, and he thinks it would be a lot more enjoyable with Celine's company. After a brief hesitation, Celine agrees, and the rest of the film consists of the two characters casually wondering around Vienna engaging in a series of conversations, some personal, some profound, and others overly extravagant.<br /><br />From there the plot doesn't get any more complicated.  While each character has his or her own unique disappointments in life, there are no huge reveals, no life defining moment that explains who they are or why they are on this journey.  Both are smart, literate, and liberal, but where Jessie is somewhat of a cynic, Celine has a bit of a radical streak.  In most romantic films there is some contrived event that prevents the two characters from getting together.  There's nothing so obvious in Before Sunrise, but Jessie and Celine do fight against their own disappointments in the world.  Watching their parents and others who have weathered life, they have realized that there are no happy endings.  If there's anything that keeps these two characters apart, it's the realization that what they have cultivated over the course of a night in Vienna cannot last.  Their relationship, as it exists now, has an expiration date.  For most of the film, they are guarded, afraid of really falling for each other.<br /><br />In something of a surprise, Before Sunrise produced two sequels (and Jessie and Celine made cameo appearances in Richard Linklater's film, Waking Life).  After watching Before Sunrise yet again, this makes a lot more sense than you might think.  Throughout the film, Jessie and Celine discuss ways in which family and profession, perception and reality whittle down our idealized romantic notions.  At one point, Jessie says, \\"It's just, people have these romantic projections they put on everything that's not based on any kind of reality.\\"  And it is, after all, a bickering married couple that causes Celine to change seats and meet Jessie in the first place.  Both characters are aware that they may very well become that couple.  In this sense the ending where both Jessie and Celine agree to meet at the same place in six months might have stood as a beautiful cop out.  The ambiguity allows us to envision what might happen in their future without fully exploring these implications.  To Linklater's credit, he decided to do the impossible and find out where these characters are nine years down the road.  As Celine says at one point, \\"It's like some kind of sociological experiment.\\"
1610390938|5.0|Review courtesy of www.subtleillumination.com<br /><br />\\"To progress, we have to abandon the habit of reducing the poor to cartoon characters and take the time to really understand their lives, in all their complexity and richness.\\"<br /><br />I'd heard before that on average, tall people earn more money. What I hadn't heard was that apparently if you control for IQ, that difference disappears - tall people are smarter and so have higher wages. A suggested explanation is malnutrition, which both reduces height and lowers IQ, and poses a significant challenge to poverty. This and other fascinating studies make up the bulk of Poor Economics, as Banerjee and Duflo follow their own advice and turn to the data to understand the challenges of development.<br /><br />If you want to help the poor, say Banerjee and Duflo, you need to give up grand theories and ideas of structural change, no matter how appealing a silver bullet may be. Rejecting Why Nations Fail, they argue that poverty is not the product of grand institutional failures, but rather is an individual or local condition, making cookie-cutter remedies useless. Development must be achieved by a series of small, well-thought out and well-tested steps, gradually accumulating into big changes, not grand designs with little relevance to the lives of the poor.<br /><br />To do so, they point out, it is essential to first actually understand the lives of the poor. Arguments often rage over whether the poor are in a poverty trap, the concern being that had they only a little more money for health, schooling, or business, they could invest and increase their wages, starting a positive cycle of investment and returns. B&D, however, dismiss the arguments of Sachs, Easterly, and others, and point out that the answer can only be found in the data, through randomized control trials and empirical work, not through theory or ideological debates.<br /><br />They do make some broader claims. Without a stable job, for example, they suggest there is little incentive to save, invest, or plan for the future. As a result, the creation of jobs with job security may be justified even if it is an inefficient method of job creation, because of the indirect benefits. I'm not sure if I agree or not, but it's an interesting point.<br /><br />Perhaps the one criticism I have of Poor Economics is that their attempt to stick to economic rationality, though understandable, can feel forced. At several times in the book, as when they're discussing how some households will borrow at a 24% rate of interest in order to save it at 2%, psychological or behavioural explanations seemed like a natural next step in the discussion, and I was disappointed when they neglected them. Still, the book adds a much-needed voice in the discussion of economic development, one driven by data, not ideology.

0307719219|4.0|Review courtesy of www.subtleillumination.com<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson present in Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty an important idea: that it is institutions that determine whether countries are rich or poor. When institutions concentrate power in the hands of only a few, nations fail. Unfortunately, their book can also be frustrating - their focus on institutions can feel like it blinds them to other possibilities, and as a result their examples, though fascinating, can feel repetitive.<br /><br />A&R argue that political and economic institutions can be extractive (designed to extract resources and centralize power in an elite who will then oppose change or progress) or inclusive (decentralizing power and allowing individuals economic autonomy). Both types of institutions, they argue, must be inclusive for long run prosperity. It's an important division, and one that has a lot of explanatory power: anyone who's crossed the American border with Mexico can't deny that it is the institutions, not the fifty feet of distance, which matters.<br /><br />The bulk of the book provides examples. Their studies are both well written and compelling, but they also make me wonder whether institutions are really the distal cause: apart from the simple case of countries with a colonial past, there is little discussion of what leads to good institutions. When they do raise the issue, they seem to implicitly assume that institutions are chosen rationally by elites, based on the cost and benefits of each type, an assumption that seems unconvincing.<br /><br />Economists and development experts often underrate the importance of institutions, and so Why Nations Fail makes a critical contribution. It also makes a strong argument against the centralization of political power, which can be tempting in the short run but corrupts institutions and social norms in the long run. It's engagingly written and full of interesting facts, and so is well worth the read for anyone remotely interested in these issues (and everyone should be). It just doesn't seem to entirely meet its (admittedly ambitious) mandate: to explain why some nations fail and some succeed.

0143122010|5.0|Review courtesy of [...]<br /><br />\\"It is a little-known fact that most terrorist groups fail, and that all of them die\\" - Steven Pinker<br /><br />Listening to the media today, one could be forgiven for assuming that human society is incurably and irredeemably violent. Nonsense, says Steven Pinker in The Better Angels of our Nature, and he has the statistics to back it up.<br /><br />The UK, for example, had 20 times as many homicides in the 1300s as in the 1900s. Murder rates as a percentage of population were higher in many traditional hunter-gather societies, like the Inuit or the !Kung, than in even the most violent US decade. Even rates of death in war were higher in historical New Guinea than in Germany in the 20th century. In fact, you are less likely to die  from violence today than at any time in history.<br /><br />Over time, Pinker argues, humans have undergone a \\"humanitarian revolution\\", actually caring about the welfare of others. The ability to read, for example, allows us to empathize with people we've never met by putting us in their place, while modernity has expanded our circles of acquaintance to include those with very different backgrounds. We've also begun a \\"civilizing process\\", adopting norms that forbid violence, and in so doing have created governments with a monopoly on law enforcement, helping us avoid a Hobbesian trap. Government is not enough, however. To truly reduce homicide rates to 1 or 2 per 100,000, he argues, there must be faith in the rule of law. It is places with limited belief in the ability of government to enforce justice that see increased rates of violence. In particular, some Southern U.S. states have both little faith in government enforcement and homicide rates close to that of Central and South America, and Pinker suggests this is no coincidence.<br /><br />Better Angels is a comprehensive book, spanning 800 pages and psychology, history, economics, sociology, criminology, statistics, biology, and a dozen other fields. On the way, it asks whether human nature is good or bad, whether society is progressing, and whether we should be optimistic about our common future. Better yet, it's engaging, entertaining, and intelligent. To be blunt, it's among the most interesting books I've read in years, and well worth the time. The decline of violence is a macro-trend we too often fail to appreciate, and understanding it is a key step to continuing it.ature is good or bad, whether society is progressing, and whether we should be optimistic about our common future.

0743277465|4.0|Review courtesy of www.subtleillumination.com<br /><br />\\"My whole life I had studied techniques, principles, and theory until they were integrated into the unconscious.\\"  - Josh Waitzkin<br /><br />Joshua Waitzkin was national chess champion in the U.S. 8 times, inspiring the movie \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer,\\" and more recently has earned two world champion titles in Pushing Hands, the martial arts version of Tai Chi. It's fair to say that he knows something about learning.<br /><br />Quite a bit of The Art of Learning is devoted to Waitzkin's career in both chess and pushing hands, and unfortunately though enjoyable it is perhaps a bit short on wisdom. Interspersed with that, however, are discussions of how he sees the learning process and the principles he believes underlie expertise in any discipline.<br /><br />Waitzkin introduces a few vague lists of principles, but in essence argues the key to excellence is the gradual mastery of fundamental principles, over time interlinked into complexity and integrated into our subconscious.  The key to such learning is to take the small things you learn and `chunk' them into larger ideas in your memory, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. As a result, an expert martial artist and a beginner actually perceive different things. A complicated strike may be made up of six parts, but an expert perceives it as one moderately fast attack. The beginner, on the other hand, sees six different moves, all blindingly fast. Mastery of the fundamentals can actually change not just how you perform an event but also how you perceive an event.<br /><br />Once you've achieved this chunking of basic concepts into complicated ones, he argues, you start achieving the deeper mastery critical for progress, and the correct decision can even seem intuitive. Studies of chess grandmasters, for example, have shown they do not see many moves farther ahead than weaker players. Instead, they have an intuition on which moves may be best, and so though they study the same number of possible moves, they study better quality ones.<br /><br />Given Waitzkin's success, the book is certainly inspirational, and mixed in with the story of his life are a few seeds of wisdom. I think my favourite story was that apparently as an offshoot of Soviet hypnosis programs, young Soviet chess players were taught to tap a piece quickly but softly against the table, in an effort to subliminally speed up the thinking of their opponent and encourage errors. Who knew?

159102594X|5.0|I'm not addicted to reading. I can quit as soon as I finish one more chapter.<br /><br />\\"The Heir from Calcutta\\". That would have been the title of that book had it been translated to English. A story of rags to riches, industrial revolution and slavery. The New World and the old one. 900 pages of it, finished in a few hours. I was 13 years old and it's still the best adventures book I ever read.<br />Then it was \\"Wolf Hall\\". 650 pages, finished overnight. The pages turned by themselves. Sleep? Ha! Who needs it!<br />I borrowed \\"The Blade Itself\\" from my local library, in an Hebrew translation, because I liked the cover. I started reading on Friday afternoon. I finished it on Saturday. Sleep? I'll pass. Food? A sandwich'll do just fine. Running? Jezal can do it.<br /><br />Is this a quest story? Not really. Is there magic in it? No more than necessary. Any prophesies, reamagined histories, unlikely heroes? Not as such.<br />Because it's not really fantasy, is it? Sticking a semi-automatic in Bayaz' hands will bring the same results as his magic.<br /><br />Imagine Shadow Moon as leader of men. Imagine Richard Sharpe with a sister. Imagine a less sexually active Val Toreth. Imagine Dumbledor with no hair.<br />Or, if you're not familiar with any of these characters, just imagine. Because Abercrombie does, taking seemingly familiar fantasy elements and turns them on their heads in the worst (if you're a character in the book) or the best (if you're a reader of it) possible way.<br /><br />And that's why I loved it so much - a good novel, in my eyes, is about interesting people in interesting situations. For me, a book (or a TV show) stands or falls on it's characters. In every book I've recently read there were one or two characters I liked very much, they were my absolute favourites and I've found myself going back to scenes featuring them, re-reading and commiting to memory favourite ones.<br />I could not do it in \\"The Blade Itself\\". It would mean reading every chapter (at least) twice.<br /><br />Jezal was playing cards the first time I met him. A pompous, emptyheaded, vain douche, who likes nothing more than his own image in the mirror. And then he competes in the Contest. And then he meets Ardee. And then he is \\"invited\\" on the adventure of his life. And I was charmed.<br />Glokta was extracting information from an old friend the first time I met him. A cruel, cynical prick, who likes nothing more than a good round of self pity. And then he treats us to a day in his life. And then he proves his competence. And then he meets some more old friends. And I understood.<br />Ferro was digging a grave the first time I met her. An abused runaway slave, who likes nothing more than to hate everything. And then she meet an old guy. And then she keeps trying to run away. And then she kills. And I admired.<br />Logen was busy not dying the first time I met him. A savage leader of a ragged band, worrying about where his next meal is going to come from. And then takes a bath. And then he comes to a big city. And then he kills. And I was impressed.<br /><br />And yet, if I had to, at gunpoint, to choose my favourite character in a cast full of favourite characters, it'd be Major West. Because he's the nicest? Or because he's the most normal? Everyone else has something special that gives them an advantage in the effed up world they have to live in - Jezal has his nobility. Logen has his \\"superior fighting skills\\" (points for guessing where this quote is from). Glokta has his job. Ferro has her healing talent. Dogman has his lack of expectations. And Bayaz has his magic.<br /><br />This is the first in a trilogy called The First Law and the author's first book.<br />I cannot rate it high enough and recommend it to anyone, whether fantasy's your thing or (especially if) it isn't.

B00B2JSRAS|3.0|E2 is a great book to read as a first approach to the Law of Attraction principles. Grout writes with easiness, wit and care for her readers. She doesn't take herself seriously, but you can see that she really lives by and believes what she preaches. The book is extremely enjoyable and fun to read, hilarious at times.<br /><br />Grout provides plenty of real life examples, scientific and New Age spiritual literature to illustrate her points. She also uses many \\"scientific\\" examples that are considered just pseudo-science by proper scientists, and speaks about Quantum Physics with such easiness that the subject seems a subject apt for primary school teaching, a fact that I always find surprising.<br /><br />Each chapter discusses one of the Law of Attraction principles, and offers one practical very simple exercise for you to follow. The exercises are fun and easy to perform.<br /><br />I did not try those that I did not have the material for, like the metallic hangers, weighing machine or potting soil. I tried the rest. The car spotting did work, a test easy to pass if you drive regularly or travel during the time of the experiment. Keeping a list of acts of kindness you receive in two days is also to pass, it is not a test, it is just focusing and reporting on the nice things that we take for granted every day.<br /><br />However, those exercises that really interested me, the ones in which you ask the Universe -or FP as she calls it- to get something you really-really want, unfortunately, did not work, despite me wanting badly to get a mini-miracle.<br /><br />Perhaps, more details about the kind of question, phrasing of the question, mood and ambience when you request something are important. I don't know, as nothing of the sort is mentioned in the book.<br /><br />Still, this is a lovely book to read. Don't expect too much, and you will enjoy it much more. I might repeat the experiments and see if I get better next time.<br /><br />I love the cover of the book.

Allan is the 100 year old man who would rather have a drink of vodka than attend his birthday party at the Old Folk's Home.  So he climbs out the window and walks to the bus station.<br /><br />The bus station is where his adventure begins.  Or at least this part of his adventure.  The story is a wonderful blend of the past and the present.  What we come to know is that this 100 year old man has had a life well lived.  He has only attended three years of schooling, yet he has become a highly sought after explosives expert.  Throughout his life he has hob nobbed with world leaders and traveled the world.  Life in the Old Folk's Home paled in comparison even at 100 years of age.<br /><br />I stopped counting how many times I laughed out loud while reading this book.  It's funny and charming with a historical twist.  Murder and intrigue are combined with outright silliness and the author told the story with a unique yet dry sense of humor.  I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what happened next.  There was an unexpected surprise around every corner.<br /><br />I can only hope I live as long and have as many interesting stories to tell.  The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared will lighten up any day and bring a smile to your face.  Life is worth living no matter what it hands you. The 100 year old man can vouch for that.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I love just about every album that QOTSA and Josh Homme have put out, but I have to say that \\"...Like Clockwork\\" sits at the top of my list.  Some of my favorite songs are on \\"Rated R\\" and \\"Songs for the Deaf\\", but all of the Queen's previous albums have tracks that I will skip without thinking twice. This is an album that I've listened to 6 times through already without skipping anything. The pacing, production and writing are all incredible. I can honestly say I love every song on this album. Previous albums have had an air of flippancy to them, literally preaching the \\"sex, drugs and rock n' roll\\" lifestyle that is so often envisioned in a rock band. There is a much more somber mood surrounding \\"...Like Clockwork\\"; an awareness of life and death, an introspection that was hinted at but never explored on previous albums.  Not to say that the album doesn't have it's share of fun straight rockers, but the slower songs are the ones I find running through my head hours later, isolated lines like \\"It's only falling in love because you hit the ground\\", and \\"not everything that goes around comes back around, you know\\", shining a new light on hackneyed and cliched phrases.<br /><br />This isn't the same band that made \\"Rated R\\", or even \\"Era Vulgaris\\". The growth is tangible; Homme is moving forward. There is something here for new and old fans alike, but don't expect QOTSA to do the same thing over and over again. They refuse to, and that's what keeps my attention and affections.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|When I saw that Hosseini had written a 3rd book, I marked the day on my calendar and was so excited to buy it, read it, and re-read it, I mean, his other 2 books are amazing! It started off so good, I was hooked, and then by the end, I was a little disappointed. I didn't get the chance to become emotionally attached to any of the characters in this book, which is why I don't think I enjoyed it as much. Hosseini is such a great author, his characters are fabulous, there's just too many characters/perspectives - over too much time - to get attached.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Who doesn't love Mary Poppins!  After all, she's like the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down!  We love Mary Poppins even more than most, because we've seen our daughter play the role!  Gotta love Disney Cruise Line!  :-)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|LOVE THIS!<br /><br />I will purchase every mystery game they release. They are that good. I can't set it down. And I can't wait to start a new mystery...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show with its twists and turns. I do want some of the people to due or get arrested though.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife was exactly what I expected.  Beefy, with a full tang.  I'm perfectly happy with the sheath that came with it as well.  I'm planning on getting a few more as XMAS gifts for my sons for their BOB's.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this  AwesomeAwesomely amazing app so much. It's so addicting an  I play in everyday. It feels so real like I'm playing with a real horse
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Easy at the lower levels and good challenge as you progress. You may have to replay some levels to earn enough to open new boards.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I thought the movie was good, but I could have waiting for it to hit HBO or something.  I don't know if it was worth the rental.  Some of the performances were beautiful, but I should have waited.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I read this book and felt like how people do when they drive by a car accident.  You can't help but look and then you're thinking, I wish I hadn't looked.  It's a strange one alright.  Read it on the ravings of an acquaintance and now I'm wondering why?
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|This movie was exactly what I expected.  DDL is a wonderful actor and he knocks balls out of the park like he's Barry Bonds.  Impressive film, but I was falling asleep.  I love historical s***, but maybe this is better as a book.  Hats off to the attention to detail in the movie (sets).  This movie is for anyone who likes history and a slow steady pace.
B00AI3UP54|3.0|I  wasn't expecting the package to be opened as if someone else already opened it. I was expecting the package to be sealed with plastic. brand new. It plays well. But the package shouldn't have been opened as if it was used. I would be a little more descriptive about the item saying that the package wasn't sealed. It didn't feel like the package was new.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|I have been watching Dexter since season 1 premiered ages ago.  I've really enjoyed the characters and plots.  The writers really know how to keep this show interesting.  I recommend this to any person who is not squeamish and also who don't mind rooting for a serial killer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|AWESOME!!! Need new rooms to play :-) anyone can play this game - really makes u use your brain - just need some new ones to do
B00AE2J93I|4.0|I guess working on Corpse Bride and Coraline has made him a bit of a stop-motion connoisseur.  He pulls it off.  I don't think this is as good as Coraline, but his debut into writing a story and directing it was wonderful.  I liked the characters, the story, and most everything else.  I expect good s*** from this cat.  This movie is for anyone who uses a Bluetooth headset to talk to the ghosts around them while pretending they are on the phone.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|This movie will be the first for my granddaughter and cant wait for us to see it when the movie arrives!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I read the Hobbit like most everyone else.  The hobbit was a small book that moved along rapidly through the story.  It glossed over most of the stuff in the movie in a single line where the movie goes on and on and on and on to flesh out those smaller details.  It's more like The Hobbit timeline from the perspective of Middle Earth rather than The Hobbit we all read.  It's better that way - you get the sense of how The Hobbit is related to The Lord of the Rings without having to read The Silmarillion.  For anyone who says - it's nothing like the book - it's true.  I loved the length and the detail of the movie. It might be better to watch it over two days though.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and I adored it, Now my granddaughter and I plan on watching it together! I cant wait but Im sure shell love it too!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I didn't hear much promotion for this film.  I'm not exactly sure why that was or maybe I was just looking in the wrong direction, but I the point is I missed it when it came to theaters.  It looked a little weird and not worth watching, but I was wrong.  I was so wrong in fact I want you to stop what you're doing and watch this.  If it's the first time - awesome.  If it's not your first time, why are you not watching it again?  It's a great story and a wonderful movie.  Disney usually screws something up.  They managed to do it right.
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|I cant wait for my granddaughter to see this movie for the first time, and I always loved it and will be proud to finally own it!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This story is fascinating to me because there double, or in some cases triple, meanings in all of the plot points, settings and even characters. It was a very cerebral read, and I think anyone who reads it will want to read it again. The human psyche is so delicate, and I enjoyed exploring that.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Paper monsters is a cartoony platformer with tight controls and great graphics. The music is okay but where the game shines is gameplay. The platforming is top notch and comparable to a handheld console. It is overly challenging at times and variable degrees of difficulty would be appreciated, but this game gets four stars for fun, child friendly gameplay and an amazing amount of polish for a mobile phone title.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Didn't think I would like this game because it looked like it would be too simple, but it really engaged me. Great game!!
B00AK57N00|5.0|A great pick-up-and-play title. It is fun to play this innovative game which could be described as: you swing from ropes trying to land on platforms. But the depth of trying to land in the exact middle for extra points or competing with friends for high-scores makes this more than a &#34;casual&#34; title.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|the movie that has lots of laughs and  includes many icons from yesterdays video games long forgot about. The plot is simple but  your so caught up in the continual dialogues it does not drag the plot and the movie. I would watch this again and add this to the many movies already in my library.
B008476HBM|5.0|This one of my favorite books.  The book is very well written.  Each time I read, it is like reading it for the first time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love that game, because it's like taking care of a real horse.The game doesn't even need any WFI (isn't that amazing).
0679805273|5.0|A marvelous book making a journey with my son as his academic career begins. Each of his teachers leave a message that he will get when he graduates!!
B004DSX5B6|2.0|I could have gotten used to opening like a Leatherman instead of the original Gerber; but other features caused me to return the item;  I  thought the jaws were more like Original Gerber than needle-nose Leatherman, but not ---and they won't even cut anything - back of jaws are a blunt match instead of being offset some as is required to cut; and trying to put the tool in the sheath and having the tool  catch/hang everytime on the lip of the stupid no use pocket  on the back inside of the sheath was very frustrating
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Short simple and sweet a good story for anyone who loves to read, very good plot and story to understand for young children and a good classic for older people to enjoy
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|It takes real guts to try to make a movie that follows in the shadow of both The Wizard of Oz and Wicked.  This movie proves you really should either not try or try harder.  Yes the effects are very good, but it does lack a script and a good leading man.  A few too many obstacles for me, I only made it through about 35 minutes before I gave up entirely.  Ah well....
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Beautiful, but disturbing.....the complete spectrum of teenage angst and love and frustrations and, and, and...all wrapped up in two characters.....everyone's dream to have this magical love.....but totally implausible.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Further adventures of the clans vying for the various kingdoms of the world of George R. R. Martin. Twists turns and shocking events keep you guessing. I can't wait for the next book. Hurry up, George!
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|Interesting book--Altucher is often thought-provoking and this book furthers that.... In the end, the message to me is, believe in yourself, take the uncomfortable path, and accept failure--it is better to live a life betting on yourself than one betting on others.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it is fun at first like when you run but when they want you to start collecting things like eggs they don't appear maybe like one.per every couple games
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Simply the best season with 11 and companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams.  The Doctor continues his whip-saw personality, mixing whimsy and a deep darkness.  Amy matures in so many ways, and Rory evolves from wimp to high-power bad ass.  The secret of River Song is finally revealed, as is the truth of the Doctor's death at Lake Silencio.  Watch and enjoy!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|also beautiful and meditative all at once. gets my brain going and my stress levels down. play all the versions of quell!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The two lead actors in this show, Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles, have the ability to do anything! The show shifts seamlessly between compellingly moving moments and laugh out loud humor due in large part to the great acting and writing on the show. A character driven dynamo, Supernatural blends action fantasy with subtle human emotion in every episode. The plots build and arc over each season, and I for one, cannot wait to see what happens next.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|Wodth the read. Archer continues this plot at times a little confusing with the character changes but its a good read.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|The movie was all over the place with the timeline. Jumping back and forth too often. Very hard to follow. Could have had better and easier to follow plots. Did not care for the foul language either as it wasn't necessary.
B00AW57L96|4.0|This a unique approach to mystery. Well write and refreshly novel but yet with ordinary people and events.  Arscommended read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far the game is pretty cool for a free game. Seems easy but I just started to play. The graphics are great.
0894803123|5.0|Earlier this spring, we flew to my daughter's house for a visit, and while there she made two different recipes from this book.  I read the book while visiting her, and right after we got home, I ordered the book for myself.<br /><br />I have been home now for less than two months, and have made four different recipes from this book.  The recipes have not disappointed me, and have tasted wonderful.  To put this in perspective, last year I think I made homemade ice cream once.  The reason for making ice cream four times this year so far, is directly due to this book.<br /><br />I have owned a KA ice cream maker for several years, and lucky to use it once or twice a year, but now am using it more often.  The recipes in the book nicely fill the KA ice cream bowl.<br /><br />The only down side to the recipes, is that the ingredients are expensive.  Its base is normally 2 cups of heavy cream or whipping cream, and that makes the ice cream more expensive than store brand ice cream... but the taste is wonderful.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|You can NOT even start level 3-1? because there is a glitch that drops you o a cactus AS SOON as you start the level!  It was a pretty good game until we reached that level.  If you fix the glitch I will gladly change my review!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|If u are good at fighting,dressing in war clothes or being the hero then this is the app for u
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is so awesome! I just NEED to pass every game and unlock every single game! You know? You should try it you'll love it!
B009KKLQVS|1.0|Now I saw the Beach Boys in concert when they visited Oslo as part of the tour, and I must say, this BluRay is a shameful representation of the concerts. First of all, it's about a third of the length of the concerts (the Oslo one that I attended lasted just over 3 hrs, including the 15-20 minute break halfway), and excludes some of the best songs of the show. Second of all, it's auto-tuned to hell, something that WASN'T done during the live concerts, at least not the one I attended, or at the ones if seen footage of on YouTube, and it ruins the sound. Mike Love sounds like T-Pain, and that's not a good thing. Thirdly, there's NO bonus footage. You are paying 15 bucks for a disc that has a shortened, autotuned digest of a concert that initially was great. How about including \\"Doin' it Again\\"? Or rehearsal footage? Hell, they at least could have tossed in an interview or something...<br /><br />Nope, my copy went back for a refund, I suggest you get [[ASIN:B00008HCB8 The Beach Boys: Good Timin'- Live at Knebworth, England 1980]] instead, it's a helluva lot better.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is an overall good game. It doesn't get boring after a while. the only problem I have is that it takes a while for certain things to get done. this game takes patience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome series. The characters are played and storyline is super. You are transported to another time.  This is a must see!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a great movie.  It held my interest the entire way thru. I would recommend it to all.  Great Movie
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think that people should read this book because it is adventures and it tells a story about how 5 friends join together to save the world from Geas assistance cracking Annabeths blood on a stone to wake Gea up and destroy the world. I think it is also about what teamwork they have to have to get though every ruf time they have during there adventure.
B004J4WN0I|2.0|I never did finish this book.  I don't know if it's because I didn't like the main character or what.  But to me it was boring.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!  It is a lot of fun and really makes you use your brain to figure out the puzzles.  It was more interesting than I thought it would be.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I liked this book though in my opinion it wasn't long enough.  It like a short story to me it was so short.  Barely over a hundred pages long.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Really amazed at some of the obscure people I think of and he nails it everytime.  Lots of fun for the entire family.
B004MPRWJG|5.0|Book was very good. Really enjoyed it made me want to see the movie. Usually like to read books first before seeing the movie
B008HK3S9K|4.0|just what i was looking for - liked the colors and the kindle slides in very easy - made well for the price
B00CLZ48FA|2.0|Save your money... The animation is terrible and the acting is sub par. If you have to see it, rent it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have always loved Pinterest since I found it and having the app has made me even more addicted than I was before hand. I am almost always on it or checking it. I like it better than if I were on the computer because I feel like it's simpler to find what you're looking for and it refreshes a lot so that you are up to date. The only downside I would say is that it doesn't tell me if I've pinned something already unlike it does when I am on the computer.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I've seen this television series before and I ABSOLUTELY love it! it's one of those television series I can watch a billion times and never get tired of. Although the 7th season started off not too good, it ended pretty decently. i still wish they could do a movie to tie off some loose ends. If so, Amy Sherman-Palladino should do the movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very enjoyable. It is free and fun.  The higher levels give more of a challenge. This is a quality game. Thanks.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|A great movie inspiring love, compassion, passion,  not to mention the responsibilities of taking care of one's own or learning the tools, skills and endurance of your first love - surfing.  A true story so giftedly written
0385344228|2.0|I was excited to read this book after having read such great reviews on Amazon and in magazines. I knew there was a twist-type ending, so I couldn't wait until it revealed itself.<br /><br />Turns out, I only made it through 120 pages before I gave up (and I LOOOOVE books, so this is a rarity). Reading it was like a chore: It seemed to take forever, and wasn't in the least bit pleasant. I found the narrator by turns arrogant and ridiculous. His actions and actions of others in the book just didn't ring true. I've never met an entire group of middle-schoolers (11- to 14-year-olds) who act like jaded 20-year-olds. Most of these kids would be scared over losing a fellow student and afraid of the police. They wouldn't be staunchly refusing to answer questions. And they certainly wouldn't be posting Facebook messages that are spelled correctly! The behavior of the wife/mother was distracting: one minute she's wringing her hands, the next she has her head in the sand. As for the father, if I had a dime for every time he said he believed his son, I could buy a good book. And why, if you believe your kid, are you tossing his room to find evidence to dispose of before the cops get there?<br /><br />Anyway, I couldn't get past all the inconsistencies. I did read the ending, though, just to see what the fuss was about. I was expecting the book to end with a bang, but was disappointed there as well. I was just relieved to be done with it.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Describing family in such a colorful, relatable yet humorous way while maintaining the underlining theme of hope and love, important to family survival and cohesiveness. I can relate to many of the scenes - just never had the talent to turn day-to-day realities into a fun and well written screenplay.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Childs has his story line perfect. The book moves fast and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I have read three of the novels and can hardly put the book down. Real perfection in story telling.
B000HL09SA|5.0|I loved this movie about a time gone by, but about the love between a pet as friend and companion which is timeless. Made me read the book as well.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is a lot of fun!  Play it and you will see.  I think it is one of the best games out there.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|We plat this in the salon clients are responding well and its fun for them to guess the artist.<br />I Still prefer the last album &#34;colouring book&#34; but this is very easy to work to.
B00338QENI|3.0|The author puts too much of herself in the story. It was still an excellent story with much to think of. I would like to hear more point of view from John Hopkins.
B009FAQ9JW|5.0|Seeing this film with fresh eyes in 2013 was a real treat. The arc of Brando's character,from cad to redemption,was masterful(real, believable),as is that of the supporting cast.I think re-releasing this film in today's theaters would be a success.  Have a good day, and try not to be a \\"tub of guts\\" or \\"gob of spit\\".
B002DD46P2|5.0|I love movie scores, and though I have not seen any of the Transformers movies, I feel like I know that universe through this music.  Steve Jablonsky has done a great job with this score and it's definitely worth listening to.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|Thank you! They are all perfect and exactly what I was looking for. Also for all 3 I thought it was a pretty good price and shipping was quick. A+
B004GYY714|5.0|I have used this &#34;radio&#34; for a year or so on my &#34;galaxy&#34; & I LOVED it! I got it for my kindle fire & it doesn't work as easy on it!  BUT... it IS a great radio! SO many radio stations. (I am sure anyone getting this will love it! (all ya gotta do is &#34;figure it out&#34; on your kindle & I am not use to mine yet!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Its ok. Its day three and I am contained to the same 2 rooms. back and forth. back and forth. I do not want to spend money.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is really fun BUT.... I can only take pictures of ME (back facing camera ONLY!)  so don't play with it enough (am NOT coordinated enought to take a picture of anyone or thing in front of me!)  DOES NOT affect the quality of this product tho!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|LOVE this movie.  Stunning visuals and great acting  underscored with spiritual truths.  I had to get my own copy so I can watch it again and again.  This movie is move is a keeper.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Really great for blocking out loud upstairs neighbors. I got it when it was the free app of the day though. Probably wouldn't have paid three dollars for it before getting to try it.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I am a hewge James fan!  I was thrilled to read this new book.  In fact, I not only purchased this Kindle version, I also bought it on Audible and just \\"listened\\" to it over my vacation last week.  It was awesome to hear James narrate his own writing.  It made his stories all the more real.  But this review is for the Kindle version so....<br />James has some great stories, some killer advice and if you read carefully, he even explains some cool business ideas.  He made me feel better about myself.  I don't have to hit it out of the ballpark every time.  It's okay to screw up and it's okay to start over...even at the age of 44.  James gives some cool ideas about how to get healthy both physically and mentally.  As a fitness fanatic, I don't necessarily agree with only eating two meals a day.  But I absolutely agree with not eating late at night and not eating crap.  I know what you are thinking, \\"Is this a diet book?\\".  No, but he does mention some of his daily habits and I just had to speak to that one.  I believe that if we take the time to implement one, some or eventually all of the habits James writes about, our lives will be better.  Our minds would be clearer, our bodies would be stronger.  This is important because as entreps, you can get all stressy and unhealthy because you are burning the candle at both ends.<br />If you like this book, you should read his blogs.  The stories are even better there.<br />Thanks for another GREAT book James.  You inspire me!<br />Cassie @SmartyCassie
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Wonderful!  The story is one I love and have read countless times, and the video as far as I can tell from the first part, is beautiful!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|An easy, addictive game to play.  The whole family can enjoy Call of Atlantis.  Bright colors and fun shapes to match up.  Also has various Mini games.  A family must.
B005LAIIKI|2.0|When I first heard the name Django I confused it with the Gypsy guitar virtuoso, but watched it anyhow.  Sorry I bothered with it.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time,, would watch it 1000 times a days!!! Wish they had sixteen candles on prime too :)
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Seems to work very on my droid razr maxx. Haven't had a problem with it yet that's why I'm giving it a 5 star rating.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have never been a fan of the stuffy PBS period pieces but I was finally talked into watching Season 1 on Netflix. After becoming instantly hooked, I was dismayed, almost in a panic, that no other seasons were available. So I bought  Seasons 2 and 3 on Amazon Video. Yes, it's kept me living the life of a recluse for the past week. Hopefully I'll have the will to go on with my life when I finish Season 3 sometime today! It's absolutely the best series I have ever seen on PBS. My ONLY caveat is the acting of  Elizabeth McGovern in her roll as Cora...I do not understand how she won an Emmy for her performance. I find myself want to smack that silly grin off her face at least once per episode. She almost looks insane! So poor casting for that roll is my ONLY minor complaint and not enough to even take 1/2 a star away.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|battery works great, I use it for our scale, and for the price I paid its a steal, a must buy item
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm normally, not a fan of horror, but this show is so well done, that I'm entertained.  I look forward to each episode.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Love Mumford & Sons. Love this album. Recently saw them in concert and they were amazing!!!! Please buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
B0039N74CW|5.0|My little girls loved it. They kept laughing and smiling through out the entire movie. They are now interested in the books as well
B00CZXIVNI|5.0|this album is the best one yet.  can't wit to see them on their concert tour. go big time rush
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|Don't spend the money on this thrown together half ass version on a sci-fi movie with no story-line worth mentioning and on the blood pouring worth watching
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thought this book was beautifully written. With an intriguing plot and dynamic characters, this book was definitely one of my favorites. The dreamy world of this circus is one that I greatly wish I could visit for myself. Would definitely recommend.
0756405890|5.0|I read the negative reviews, and held off on the book. It didnt quite sound like my cup of tea, and I think I was avoiding fantasy at that time.<br />A few days ago, I was bored, couldn't find an interesting book (does anyone else have that issue, amazons search kinda sucks), and grabbed The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />In short, it was excellent. A detailed look at the life of Kvothe, less than epic which felt like a refreshing change to the Tolkien inspired 'save the entire universe' type of books.<br /><br />I didn't find Kvothe arrogant, if you outperform, it becomes obvious that you are better. His relationships with the people he likes were touching, and apart from his expertise with everything, his portrayal as a youth was easily believable.<br /><br />The greatest potential flaw this book had was the \\"The hero is awesome at everything, and is strong and handsome and ...\\". That was the main reason I initially avoided this book, based on the negative reviews I read. I hate that, drives me mad. Or the \\"starts off weak and then discovers a magic power and becomes strong and ...\\".<br /><br />This book didnt have that. Yes, he's good at stuff, but the author makes it very clear that although hes enormously gifted at things, he is not enormously gifted at life. Just stumbling around and learning like the rest of us.<br /><br />Really recommend it.<br /><br />Greg
B000I0RR76|5.0|A terrific and fun movie to watch with the whole family. Errol Flynn plays Robin Hood like no other. His charisma and energy makes this film very exciting. All the actors and actresses are terrific in this movie and on HD DVD or Blu-Ray with the vibrant colors and a great musical score just makes this movie an even more worthy purchase.

B008JFUPK8|4.0|10 years ago a movie by the name of Hulk came out and I being just a young boy was ecstatic. But once I saw the movie, I was disappointed. Similarily, in 2006 a movie called Superman Returns came out; however, once I viewed it, I again found myself disappointed. Alas, came the year 2008 a movie called The Incredible Hulk was released and finally it was everything I wanted (and more) the first time.Then on June 14th, 2013 came a day like no other. A movie entitled: Man Of Steel was released and after watching it, I was emotionally/extremely satisfied.<br /><br />(November 17,2013 Update after blu-ray purchase)<br /><br />When I wrote the review for Man of Steel back in June, I was excited, and admittedly overwhelmed. I was also determined to give a perfect review; but in having those feelings, I now realize made me rush my review. And that was not my intention. After watching the blu-ray, I felt the need to re-write and give a new score and apologize for giving a rushed review. To those of you who have followed my reviews from the start, I do apologize. And for your consideration, here are my thoughts on Man of Steel.<br /><br />Actor Henry Cavill stars as Superman. I have seen Henry Cavill in an episode or two of The Tudors and also remember seeing him in the movie Immortals. He does possess a rather diverse, yet sensible acting ability so he is a great choice for Superman.<br /><br />The Story in this movie: to describe it or rather compare it to other great comic book movies: It shares common traits found in the movie Thor, but with a darker and more serious tone, combined with some elements of Batman Begins. That being said, This movie undeniably flies with style.<br /><br />There have been complaints made about there being TOO much action in Man of Steel; but that was one of my main issues with Superman Returns, there not being enough, if ANY action in the movie. I don't feel it was that big of an issue. One of the many good things that you will notice in Man of Steel is the music. For every punch, every scene of Superman taking flight the music that plays fits perfectly with those scenes. Zack Snyder, well what can i say. The minute I heard he would be the director of this film, I knew I would get two things: great visuals, and detailed action sequences. And you do get both in Man of Steel. And with that, we get a Superman movie that digs deep into the mythos. I was actually shocked at how deep the story is in this movie. I am also happy that Christopher Nolan had a helping hand as the producer of this movie. As a whole once the movie was over, I felt relieved. The same feeling I felt after watching the 2008 reboot The Incredible Hulk, is the same feeling I had after viewing this movie. DC has not had the best filmography as of late (except for the Nolan Batman movies), but Man of Steel is definitely an excellent way to give DC fans hope excitement/anticipation for more heroes like Aquaman, Flash, etc. to get their own movies. Man Of Steel did not exceed my expectations, but it met them by a big margin. GO SEE/BUY MAN OF STEEL.<br /><br />This long awaited movie gets a score of:<br /><br />4 Stars<br /><br />Henry Cavill: Clark Kent/Superman<br />Russell Crowe: Jor-El<br />Kevin Costner: Jonathan Kent<br />Amy Adams: Lois Lane<br />Laurence Fishburne: Perry White<br />Michael Shannon: General Zod<br />Diane Lane: Martha Kent<br />Christopher Meloni: Colonel HardySteel is the music.

B000GCFY0I|5.0|The book Uglies is absoloutely AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is a deffinate must read and packed full of action. The book is also suspensul, romantic and full of adventure, the perfect elements for a perfect book. When your reading Uglies, not only are you reading, but your traveling to distant lands, meting new characters and experiancing hardly imaginable experiances. Plus, you get a knowledge of the harsh world the main character lives in, but yet experiance the beauty of it. Again, Uglies is wonderfully written book, and probbably one o fthe best ever.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|For me, this is the best Mahjong app out there. It has several different games to keep you going for a long while and I enjoy that they are timed and you get rated with stars on each one.  I have tried several different Mahjong games but could not find any as good as this one.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|I started reading this book with no idea that it was a reconstruction of an event long buried in history. The details are shocking to someone who avoids Gore as much as possible. But the author is correct in asserting that Pamela Werner should not be forgotten.
B004YKB52O|5.0|I haven't put this in a review but, this is the first album from Simple Plan that I actually bought (as the title says). I didn't actually get into all this music I like when Simple Plan came out with \\"No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls\\", which is a huge masterpiece to my CD collection. I actually first heard of Simple Plan when I was at Kmart once, in which I saw a music video for a song on this album (Can't Keep My Hands Off You). So I looked them up on the computer and bought this album three days later at Walmart. This eventually led to this (and the other three albums) entering my CD collection.<br /><br />This is a more pop kind of pop punk album but I absolutely LOVE it without a doubt. Simple Plan is still able, as well as have no member depart from the band since their formation in 1999-2000, to record great songs on records they put out. A review below shows a lot of power:<br /><br />You Suck At Love (4.5/5)<br />Can't Keep My Hand Off Of You (5/5)<br />Jet Lag (4.5/5)<br />Astronaut (5/5)<br />Loser of the Year (5/5)<br />Anywhere Else But Here (5/5)<br />Freaking Me Out (5/5) (BECAUSE ALEX GASKARTH FROM ALL TIME LOW SINGS IN IT)<br />Summer Paradise (4/5)<br />Gone Too Soon (5/5)<br />Last One Standing (5/5)<br />This Song Saved My Life (4/5)<br /><br />This review now tells gets me thinking: When exactly is their fifth studio album going to be released?
B00684J49U|5.0|All was great in every department.  NO complaints. Completely satisfied!
B00063MBU8|4.0|This is probably my least favorite album from Simple Plan, but I do love some of the songs on here to the core. I am very happy for buying this CD because it's mostly a work of art even though it's not my favorite record from them. I still have a very positive review for it:<br /><br />Shut Up (5/5)<br />Welcome To My Life (5/5)<br />Perfect World (5/5)<br />Thank You (4/5)<br />Me Against The World (3.5/5)<br />Crazy (4.5/5)<br />Jump (5/5)<br />Every time (4/5)<br />Promise (5/5)<br />One (4/5)<br />Untitled (4.5/5)<br /><br />The ratings kind of alternate between 3.5 and 5, but Simple Plan still is able to bring out lots of their rock side in this record. Maybe not songs I am too huge on, but it is normal for even one of my tied favorite bands of all time to have a few basically lowered-down grades. Right?
B005FISBTO|5.0|All was great in every department.  NO complaints. Completely satisfied!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is my favorite Linkin Park album of all time. Pure Hard Rock is heard right here on this masterpiece. Don't Stay is my favorite track on this record. Numb is also absolutely awesome, not as hard, but still an A+. This is what girls should be in love with, this what guys should rock and roll to, this is allowed in any rock fans collection of music discs. Cheaters screaming will have you amazed from start to finish, and so will Mike's talented rap.  I LOVE EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS WORK OF ART. Put down that garbage One Direction CD (smash it) and play this SOOO loud on your stereo. Ignore anyone who tells you to turn it down (and especially ignore them if they tell you to turn it off). I guarantee ANYONE will love this album.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Most usuable item needed for consistent reading of ebook. Hope this lasts longer than one that came with ebook. It got all cracked and coating chipped away from wiring.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|ITS  a step backward. Not anything new. It still has the fun of the original, but was .expecting more or a new game play element.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Awesome! Great series! We just visited Bastogne, stood in one of their fox holes and were just in awe by what these men did!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You can't go wrong with Downton Abbey! It's easy to care about the characters, either love or hate, and I'm trying to pace myself so I don't run through the second season too fast. Sadly, it will end all too soon, then a long wait for season 3.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|First let me say that I am a big fan of the Land of Oz book series and I was a bit apprehensive. But I have to say despite taking a few liberties with the Wizard. ( Who by the way is always an old man in the series.} This movie was pretty darn true to the Oz story concept. One of my favorite parts in the wizard of oz book is the china kingdom, where all the people are living china ( like the dishes ) And Dorthy spots a china doll and starts chasing after her, the whole time the china doll is yelling dont \\" dont chase me \\"dont chase me. ( also if you did not know Dorthy is just a little girl in the series ) For me to see the China kingdom come to life was pretty darn cool. As to the acting and special effects. It was very well done I did not watch this in 3d I just streamed it to my old tv. But I thought it was beautiful. I think the wizard was spot on, I think that is just how he would have been if he was younger. And considering that this story is based on the story the wizard tells Dorthy about his first arrival in Oz ( which is just a short narrative ) I have to say the liberties taken with The witches and Glenda are pretty acceptable. And Frank L Baum never does go into much detail about where the witches come from or who they were before they became wicked so its open to interpretation. So if you judge this movie in correlation with the book series, I would have to say that every actor and actress in the show captured the characters very well. So five stars from me! This was what an Oz story should be like! Now if they would only make the patch work girl of oz into a movie! Now that would be awesome.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Actually, I think most the author's ideas are true - not only the good ones but the bad. BIG BROTHER is watching!<br />The author's view is like CALOS CASTENEDA on steroids. It might have been better had not the hero's been teenagers. But still a good read
B004SEUJVO|5.0|excellent movie.<br />I give it 5 stars. it has five great<br />stars including Kristen Stewart.<br />the movie has a great story and<br />is funny, witty comedy.
B003DS3GC0|4.0|IF YOU LIVED IN THE INNER CITY YOU CAN RELATE TO THIS MOVIE. GOOD MOVIE FOR EVERYONE, GOOD PLOT AND GREAT ACTING. A VERY GOOD THREAD RUN THROUGH MOVIE FROM BEGINING TO END.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it but the turns and glitches mess things up but other than that thank you for making this game

B002XTBE6K|5.0|It is in my opinion the best production of Jane Austin's Emma by far. It more closely resembles the novel. Romola Garai is a most lovely and a true copy of Miss Emme Woodhouse and I just loved Jonny Lee Miller,he makes for a precious Mr Knightly. All the supporting cast has done a very supreme job in their roles. This is a much slower pace than the others and more detailed. I absolutly loved it and may be one of my very favorites of Miss Austin's. Great job BBC for this production.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good but short<br />Entertaining game a few levels were a little tricky. Glad it was free since it was so short.
0061433063|3.0|This is the fourth book of the Tiffany Aching subseries of Discworld.  It is ... eventually good.  The beginning, though, is very very dark, much darker than any other Discworld book.  There is a plot explanation for much of this, eventually, but until you get to it, you may find yourself wondering if it's worth continuing to read (at least, if you're used to the more light-hearted style of most of Discworld).  It is.  It gets better, and ends on a rather impressive high note.<br /><br />I'd probably give the last half of the book 5 stars, and the first half maybe 2-2.5.  As a compromise, I'll rate the thing altogether as 3.<br /><br />For parents, since this is aimed at the young adult audience, I'd recommend reading the first few chapters before letting your child read it.  There is some rather disturbing content there.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Excellent movie. Worth the price of admission, 2 big stars share the stage in this one. I hadn't even realized this movie was out.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|An interesting premise that could have been better explored in a short story or a novella at best, but as a novel it dragged on until it's eventual decent, but not too surprising conclusion.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a fun game to play even after you've beaten it.  I can't wait for Plants vs. Zombies 2.
B000002BHE|5.0|As always, a great song by a great Artist!  I have most of her CDs and play them thru my &#34;I Tunes.&#34;
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I never expected to like this book but after trying the sample I was hooked. This subject matter seemed distasteful but the writing was so good and the book became intriguing. Highly recommend.
B00BPA7U34|5.0|I have all of his CDs.  He reminds me of Frank Sinatra and the type of songs he sang.  These are songs that make sense to a 91 year old lady.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was an eye opener as I had not previously realized this was based on historical facts. Enjoyable read well written would recommend.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Most of her songs are geared to my generation - the ones from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s!  From then on the crazy music of younger generations don't make sense to me.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I'm mad Mila Kunis was in this movie. Her acting wasn't even good. I thought the movie was boring until the end. The colors are amazing, but the movie itself is no good!
B00CZXIVNI|5.0|The more I listen, the more I like it!!!  But no more confetti please! Don't forget to watch the show on Nick!
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Thought the movie and 3D blu ray were pretty good. The 3D (IMO) was on par with Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Haven't seen it? Well how about Journey to the Center of the Earth w/Brendan Frasier? Okay it was like that but bloodier and with the occas F-Bomb. Didn't encounter any ghosting or bad transfer blurring. There were several pop-out effects thrown in for your viewing pleasure, some of which made me go, was that \\"really\\" necessary? Won't go into detail but it/they were and happy that they were included, heck these two are killing witches so there had better be pop-outs! Whatever you do don't eat the F-bomb-ing candy...

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Second read, even better than first time. I can see why the price has increased since I bought it. Worth it. I think this would make a totally awesome movie.
B005LAIII0|5.0|(my wife is the 5-star giver).  Tough for animal lovers to watch.  A compelling story nevertheless.  In my experience, after freeing an elk from a barbed wire fence, the animal looks back in acknowledgement before disappearing into the woods.  The tiger, I think, would have too, and this is a sore point of the movie with me. Otherwise, well done.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is one of the best games I have on my kindle its so time engulfing when your bored and just great on the kindle device it works like a charm and has no glitches or problems I truly am glad I downloaded this game
1781162646|5.0|What a wonderful book! I haven't read a Stephen King book since \\"It\\" that grabbed me from the start so completely that I felt as if I was walking with the characters. Although I've never worked at an amusement park, I used to visit Rocky Point in Warwick, RI when I was a kid in the '70's. Compared to Disneyland and Disneyworld, it wasn't top-notch but the fun we had, the laughter we shared and the memories we created still make me smile now years after Rocky Point closed for good. Thanks to those memories and Stephen King's terrific storytelling ability, I could see and hear all the sights and sounds of Joyland as Devin Jones experienced them. I was literally on the edge of my seat while reading the heart stopping final ride, Devin takes on the Ferris Wheel. I highly recommend this book not only to Stephen King fans but to anyone looking for a great summer read. I must warn you that although you may intend to read a few pages at a time you might just want to keep going to see how it ends.
B009K0P10K|5.0|A very refreshing suspense series (although the story not unlike The Count of Monte Cristo). The characters are brought to life so beautifully by amazingly talented actors. The set perfect and cinematography exquisite. Thank you so much to the producers and director for bringing this to television (and DVD) during a time of rare 'quality' programs!! So looking forward to Season 3!
125000098X|5.0|It is a wonderful continuation of the first two books of this trilogy.  Unexpectedt twists - leave you waiting anxiously to see what happens next and you are never disappointed..  Jeffry Archer is one of my favorite authors.  After I read &#34;Not a penny more not a penny less&#34;  I knew I had to read everything else he has written.

B00499NHLC|5.0|I am a Sherlock Holmes junkie - I grew up reading all the original mysteries.  But I've been continuously disappointed with newer 'adaptations'.  Either the mysteries aren't as good, or the characters aren't reminiscent of the originals.  But this is an exception.  While the mysteries are all updated to fit in the modern setting, they skills Holmes uses in his deductions were very true to the original stories.  And the characters are beyond fantastic.  Dare I say even better?  No, I can't quite go that far - but Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of my favorite detective was perfect.  Arrogant, brilliant, and more than a little crazy.  It was so fun to watch him come to life - and many of his lines come straight from the books.  Martin Freeman as Dr. John Watson was just as perfect.  Undeniably likable, his character also allows the viewer glimpses of the softer side of Sherlock.  Throughout the season, you can see the respect the writers and creators had for the original stories, through the lines spoken, the setup, and the mysteries themselves.  I'm not someone who usually notices things like lighting and music in a movie (as these episodes are much more movie like than tv series), but those aspects played into this too.  The darker setting for certain scenes and beautiful musical compositions really did contribute the the overall feeling of the series.<br /><br />This is a fantastic choice for any fan of Sherlock Holmes.  If you aren't familiar with Sherlock, this would be a great start too!  I highly recommend this series - it just gets better and better as it goes along!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Great book, I had  to put it down a few times in the beginning. What Phillip and Nancy did to Jaycee was unbelievable. She is such a strong person. Well worth buying, it kept me wanting to restore. Good luck Jaycee!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I never thought I could get wound up in a supposedly \\"dry\\" English series, but this far exceeds my expectations.  It is superb.  The acting is perfect.  The setting is spectacular.  I'm so glad amazon had this!  Thank you!!  A forever Downton Abbey fan.

B000001E3L|3.0|This 2 disc set has two performances from Van undertaken a week apart in the Bay Area, more than 20 years after Van lived in Marin and was a fixture at the Fillmore.<br />He is now at his  bluesiest, accompanied by Georgie Fame, John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Witherspoon, Junior Wells and his daughter (on one song).<br /><br />I disagree with one reviewer that these live performances suit Morrison well or as well as his studio counterparts, though he is a dymamic performer and doesn't lack for the contingent of musicians needed for his sax-heavy revue-like sound.<br />It starts out way too frenetically with Have Ye Been Healed, one of my favorite songs, but the tempo needs to be slowed down to get a better more contemplative effect, which is true of many tunes on this compilation.<br /><br />If it ever would slow down and the Irish Mystic came through a little more, it would be more engaging for me.<br />This will appeal to those who like the bluesier Morrison, not the Irish Mystic so much.<br /><br />I got the unremastered version because the 2008 version is so expensive (a used one of the earlier perfomance was expensive enough) and found the recording quality to be fine.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|Should have listened to the other buyers and stayed away, far away. Doesn't even work, doesn't matter what the orientation is if the diode is bad to begin with. Would cost just as much to ship it back then it would for the refund.

There are three things I want to say.<br /><br />One:  \\"Kind of Blue\\" is as deep and rich and rewarding a musical experience as I know of but you actually have to listen to it.  It isn't like that frothy bubbling feeling you get from Kenny G if you don't listen too close.<br /><br />Two:  Talking about the greatest this or that when you are talking about music is probably silly.<br /><br />Three:  Ahemm....when I'm in the right mood I actually like Kenny G.  There, I said it!
B000FGGE68|5.0|My DVD of UltraViolet came with a digital version whose moniker is \\"UltraViolet.\\"  This was my first experience with digital delivery, so you can imagine my confusion.  However, as usual, delivery, product and price were outstanding.  (Who doesn't have a crush on Milla Jovovich?)
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This is a surprisingly great movie.  When it starts, you wonder if you want to stick with it, then decide you might was well just because it promises great scenery.  As it goes along, you fall in love with it, and are almost certainly crying at the end.  It teaches a lot about kids, and parents alike.  Amazing movie, highly recommended!
B009MO57H6|5.0|The story continues, and Milla Jovovich just gets better at her martial arts.  The cliffhanger ending is positively unbearable, but it sure makes you want to see the next one!  Can't get enough...
B009XIXVU6|3.0|While beautifully written, I found the story line contrived in order to cover major events in Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, this book is worth reading -- and preferably in a relatively short time, since there is a large cast of characters with complex relationships to one another .
B0074YVW1G|5.0|What you need when you want to understand introverts and extroverts alike.  Helped me understand a lot more about myself.
B00338QENI|5.0|An amazing story  containing two different threads.  First, it is the story of cells taken from Henrietta Lacks that become the cell line used by scientists world wide for research. Second, it is the story of journalistic perseverance in order to get the cooperation of and the story from the very reluctant (even hostile) family members of Henrietta Lacks who bristle with resentment that they never received anything from the sale of the HeLa cell line.  The book raises complex issues of research ethics.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Game is cute, fun to play but if you want to make in game purchases it robs you blind.  Everything costs you. Would not suggest for parents with young children simply because of the money they ask of you just to keep progressing. The in game rewards are pitiful.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author can do no wrong in my eyes....his capture of his characters is vivid, his writing style brings life<br />to his stories and I can hardly wait for his next................
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I wish I didn't need to wait to get season 2.  Season 1 was great and so much more enjoyable to watch it all at once rather than once a week.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|I went to see Man of Steel. The producers had everything they needed to make a GREAT Superman movie. The guy playing him (Henry Cavill) was a great choice, and it had a really good backstory. They just forgot to have a MAIN story. There was no plot beyond the character's backstory, which the producers decided to weaken. There was a lot of senseless destruction, by means of hokey-looking computer animated special effects during the overkill of fight scenes. (I'm getting tired of these movies where they destroy everything so quickly that you can't even tell what's going on.) There was no comic relief at all, which was MUCH needed...and actually, now that I think about it, there was not a lot of dialogue throughout most of the movie, with exception of the backstory scenes.  The first half hour I was thinking to myself, \\"Ok.  Good backstory.\\"  Then the rest of the movie I was thinking, \\"Ok, we get it!  They fight!  Where's the plot that they were building up to?\\"<br /><br /> Another gripe that I have is that they had to go and change the characters. I never get it when they do that in the movies. I mean, do they sit down and say, we have a successful franchise, so let's change everything that made it successful and ruin it. For example: let's make a Superman movie, but Lois Lane won't be anything like she has been in any previous Superman storyline, we'll make Perry White a black man with an earring, and let's not even have a Jimmy Olson. Then, Superman will just emerge on the scene with no secret identity, so there's basically no Clark Kent. (Everyone knows that much of the Superman story is how Clark struggles with wanting to be himself, but feels an obligation to be Superman to help people.) In this movie, Clark was just a name they slapped on this Super kid until he became a super man. I felt that the bond between he and his parents was very weak.<br /><br />  I guess you should stop reading here if you don't want to know about any spoilers.<br /><br />  The whole concept of Clark's dad dying from a heart attack has always been that he was not able to save him despite having super powers. He could save everyone else, but he couldn't save his dad.  What a waste of a great actor.  Come on, directors!  You've got Kevin Costner, and you choose NOT to have the famous \\"Clark's dad dying in his arms and there's nothing he can do to save him\\" scene?  Kevin Costner could have rocked that scene.  (I would have loved to know what final bit of advice he would have given Clark about him being sent here for a reason, and how he should go about doing it.)  Nah!  Let's just have him stand there and stretch his hand out towards Clark while he watches and CHOOSES not to save him.  Arrggh!  I think that is where the movie started losing me as a die-hard Superman fan.<br /><br /> My biggest gripe, as a LOIS & CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN fan, is that they totally killed the competitive chemistry that is supposed to exist between Lois and Clark, and the humor that always resulted from Lois not knowing Clark and Superman were the same person...and he's always having to run off somewhere and try to make up a story about why he stood her up, ditched her, etc. That's the best part about the Lois and Clark romance.<br /><br /> I guess I'm just disappointed. When I heard that it was being made by the same people who made the last three Batman movies (which were great and FULL of story and plot) I was excited. The previews for Man of Steel didn't look so interesting, but I figured they might just be holding back so not to spoil anything, as they had done with the Batman movies. I don't know what happened.<br /><br /> The guy who played the part was a GREAT choice, so we can't blame him. And we got to see a more fleshed out Krypton for the first time, complete with alien beasts, which was really cool. It had so much potential, and I am such a Superman fan that I actually feel dirty inside by speaking badly about it, but I was let down. The movieproducers who are handed a tried and true story need to be more responsible. They shouldn't have the right to put their artistic spin on it. It's an American icon, and it belongs to us, the fans. They should have an obligation to not ruin our stories that have helped to make us who we are. Go be artsy with something else, don't mess up our classics.<br /><br /> I'm not saying to avoid seeing it, and maybe it's going to get better with the next movie (that it seemed to be building towards) but I don't know how they can fix the Lois and Clark thing unless she bumps her head and gets amnesia forgetting that he is Superman. But I wish I had waited for it to come out on DVD.
159463176X|5.0|A thoughtful and intriguing book -- I wrestled between needing to put it down so I can absorb what I'm reading, and not being able to put it down.
B009NX409M|2.0|Frank, Robert De Niro, and Molly, Meryl Streep meet by accident in a book store at Christmas.  They run into each other again and an infatuation develops between them.  They look forward to the ride into the city on the train when they can see each other.  Unfortunately, they are both married and Frank has kids.  The infatuation grows until all they want is to be together with each other.  Nice fairy tail, but what is left out of the movie is the devastation their affair causes to their spouses and his kids.  Neither seems to care about what their affair has done to others and the abandonment of a father to his kids. They both get a divorce from their spouses.  Finally they meet again and get together and live happily ever after.  Really, never having a relationship with his kids again and showing betrayal to a spouse is a happy ending?
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A good summer read. Better than the usual fluff. Interesting characters and progression of the story. I would be interested to read other books by this author.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|I think season 5 of true blood was the best season yet. I can't wait to see what happens in season 6

B00CH87HF4|3.0|With everything wonderful theirs a downfall..... this game is put together very well for multi and single, would be a five star if weren't for the slow start ups and glitches
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game which is both easy and hard in parts. I found it frustrating at times but hard to put down. Excellent game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy the challenge of finding the right combinations to finish each level. My nieces and nephews have even started playing and we keep in touch to see who is at what level.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|I thought this movie was awful.  I gave it 30 minutes and then stopped watching it.  The constant bickering between the characters and badgering by the mother did not make for a 'feel good' movie.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Plot lacking originality. Sex is great but no substance in romance. It almost seems forced to be drawn out... Ending, it didn't leave me hanging; it just freakin' left as if I was one of Crowd's woman just screwed in the hotel sex pad.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|This is a very cool movie that flips from girls trying to escape a mental hospital, to various fight scenes to complete missions inside of Baby's head. The music was also awesome in the movie.
159463176X|5.0|I was very retıcent to read thıs novel for fear of dissapointment ... His other two novels were .... I can hardly find the words to describe them... Just know that they effected me profoundly .. This one is right up there with the other two ... It absolutely did not dissapoint but moved me from heavens down to the darkness of hell and I loved every sentence every word ... A beautiful story told with such humanity such understanding of the human nature ... Khaled Hosseini is a writer that loves people with their good sides and their bad ... He is a master at story telling ... My only disappointment is how long until the next one ?????
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Fiona continues to surprise! Again, another origional CD from an amazing artist. The deluxe version is worth it for the extra music... but I thought the 'photos' and her little booklet w/ scribbles and handwritten lyrics weren't anything special. Buy it for the music... not the extras.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great price, shipping was great and we absolutely LOVE this movie!!!! Great for kids/adults of all ages! A definite buy for any movie collection.
B000HSIEPI|5.0|This well crafted tale of British intrigue and \\"spider-web\\" politics is acted by an unusually fine group of villains.  Prepare to be startled by unexpected metaphorical images.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Read this book a two days. I loved this book and look forward to reading the last chapter in this trilogy.  Best buy ever
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|My wife and I both agreed that the best actor in this film was the dog. Having said that, he was an exceptionally gifted dog actor, so it's swings and roundabouts.<br /><br />Plus points: The action sequences are brilliant. Really good, and have much better pacing than in the book where they are somewhat ponderous and muddy in the detail. Also, some of the more laborious bits of the book are left out, so when it does eventually get going (after about the first 70 minutes), it's pretty good.<br /><br />Minus points: The lead guy is a muchness. The lead guy's dad/guardian is cold and unlikeable, pretty much binning the character from the book. The woman playing number six has something of a \\"Mid-Pacific\\" accent, veering between Australia and the US on a sentence-to-sentence carousel of linguistic wonderment. The whole of the first hour is pretty dull. I was going to say terrifyingly dull, but that romanticises it somewhat - it's just dull.<br /><br />But there is enough going on to keep you interested. Don't read the book first though - I guarantee you'll be disappointed.
0140067477|5.0|This book is the best introductory text to Taoism that I have ever read.  After reading the Pooh stories to my children many years ago I already knew there were practical adult lessons to be learned by the children's stories.  This text doesn't get into anything religious but provides the very deceptively simple approach to everyday living that I strive for.  The author uses the characters from the original Pooh stories to illustrate very deep concepts.  He uses a device of writing with Pooh sitting on his table asking questions.  He then creates brief illustrations using the characters of the animals from the origanal Pooh stories to illustrate what he means.  He also quotes ancient Taoist authoris.  The author is very knowledgable and actually did the translations of the Taoist authors himself.  If you are looking for a way to help you approach life, this is the book for you.  I sent a copy to my daughter who is pregnant and will soon give me my third grandchild so that she will understand how to approach life as it is just about to get very complicated.
B00BF123WG|2.0|An otherwise fine film is spoiled by the writers' having accepted at face value the self-serving account of those invested in justifying the torture of prisoners as a effective means of intelligence gathering.  The effectiveness of torture is strongly contested, both as a general matter and as to whether it contributed significantly to finding Bin Laden.  The subject is important enough that the writers should not so strongly have taken one side of the issue in a film that purports to be based on actual events.  Simply having the lead character look uncomfortable during the torture doesn't redeem the situation.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|How did this group of books go undetected for so long.  I regret that the Author has died and cannot write anymore books.  He did a great job and I absolutely loved the works.
1400032717|1.0|Autistic people are on the \\"autistic spectrum,\\" and there is a \\"fiction spectrum\\" too, on which this book hangs by a dubious thread.  At first superficially entertaining, this book quickly becomes a liability and an ugly experience.  When does writing fiction about a character with so complex a condition as autism, or any other disability, become a sort of moral and social disservice?  Do not think that you will gain real insight into autism by reading this book, and if you have autistic friends and family, do not read it. Spend more time with your autistic friends and family instead! For entertainment, infinitely better options exist.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The title says it all. The writing is so well done, that characters are so easy to love or hate, and the story is fantastic. I've never been very high in fantasy such as this, but it has made me a believer. This was my first time reading anything by B. Sand.; and I immediately downloaded the mistborn trilogy when I found out the next installation after the way of kings isn't out yet. He's a fantastic author that is sure to steal your sleep with his fantasy world.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Got the new Black Sabbath for Father's Day and it is surprisingly awesome!  Obviously and for good reason it had gotten a lot of hype, and I figured it would be well worth hearing a studio album with Ozzy after THIRTY-FIVE years.  But it is really stunning.  It's impossible to really judge it versus their back catalog which is so classicized in our minds and hearts and music history over many decades.  But it is at the least a worthy follow up to their doomiest and darkest hours, and the production is absolutely perfect for a metal album, especially for Black Sabbath.  It has a cutting purity that even their greatest classic albums did not have, if you will recall.  And it feels easily like the best work Ozzy has really done since Ultimate Sin, although, at least for a lot of the interim releases that is a kind of low bar.  Too bad they couldn't come to a deal with Bill Ward, but musically the drums fit everything quite well. Well done forefathers!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle gives a detailed account of his career as a US Navy SEAL - from his years prior, training, combat, and post Navy life. Anyone interested in SEAL literature or snipers should read this book. Also, there are passages written by his wife which detail the social-toll of being a SEAL.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Excellent overview of social and political forces in American society on the eve of WW II. Some aspects are similar to today.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was my first David Baldacci book and it will not be my last. I am about to buy the second Will Robie book right after I post this. This story was a little easy to put together, but it was a fresh change of pace from all the James Patterson.
B00BI745AA|1.0|A lot of wasted acting talent here torturing the audience, simply horrible and unwatchable.<br />To put it bluntly I rented this on a special for 99 cents and I should have given the money to a homeless person.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars Trilogy is what I was looking for. I have the VHS versions of these movies when they first came out and I can't watch them because my vhs player doesn't work so now I have them on DVD so now I can watch them all over again.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I love Ken Follett and I love historical novels.  Follett is a master indeed at painting a picture and capturing human affect and feeling in print.  Just settle down to read this, as it is long and detailed.

B0058VW36U|4.0|I picked up this free app  to keep the kids quiet on a road trip and it worked beautifully.  It has colorful, clear graphics and simple, but decent sound effects, and we have not had to deal with the intrusive adverts that accompany many of the free apps.  Many levels which will allow all of us to use the game for a while.

B003V9OCS8|4.0|Action, adventure, a little romance... it's all here.  Even with subtitles, this film is easy to watch and keeps you engaged.  I've not read up on the accuracy of the story, but it sure does inspire you to find out more.  Enjoy this movie, you won't regret watching it.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|There don't seem to be any guide's. It's probably the most boring game out there. What's the point of this game? I can't see any, except frustration over the waste of time.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Fun, full of action, and very entertaining movie.  My daughter and I watched it and enjoyed it.  I would recommend this movie.  It is worth buying.  Love Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton.  Can't wait for a second Hansel and Gretel movie.

B00BF124PC|3.0|The movie painstakingly details the time and groundwork needed to track down terrorists in their culture and in sympathetic countries. Mostly accurate in details, not too badly sensationalized.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Not one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, but passable to watch on a Saturday afternoon when you have nothing else to do. Even the 3D doesn't add anything to this movie.

B0053O89XI|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It is fun, upbeat and intelligent. I recommend it to everyone who likes good comedy.
B008602KQI|4.0|The film brilliantly captured the spirit of the book, respecting both viewers who had read it and those who coming to the story fresh. The costumes and sets portrayed the scenes with creativity and captivation. The action and courage was conveyed without too much gratuitous violence. The characters had depth and personality for an action film. It was the best science fiction action film I have seen since Avatar.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it years ago. I love the 3D version even more because it brings me closer to the action.
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|Intriguing story, nicely shot, well acted.Just the right amount of schmalz. My Wife and I look forward to the next installment.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Another great story by Hosseini.  The character development was very strong, but the weaving of the plot kept the story moving with interesting turns and twist.  Further, it opened my eyes to the forces of politics and human endurance in spite of that force.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|\\"Martyrs\\" is a 2008 French horror film about a young woman named Anna attempting to help her childhood best friend, a disturbed woman named Lucie who, as a child, escaped from a group of unknown people who were torturing her mercilessly. 15 years after her escape, Lucie has found the home of a seemingly average family and sets forth attacking them, insisting they were the ones who had held her prisoner and tortured her. When Anna shows up and is horrified by what Lucie has done to the family, she soon gets caught up in the mysterious truth of Lucie's nightmarish existence and finds herself suffering far more than even Lucie had.<br /><br />This is one of those times you say, \\"I just saw a seriously messed up movie,... and I'm not sure I'm glad I did.\\" I have never seen misogyny in filmmaking like this. That's not the \\"idea\\" of the movie, and maybe it wasn't even the feeling behind it, but it was the impression that comes across. Never has the term \\"torture porn\\" seemed so appropriate. This is literally a lot of horrific torture of women with a very simple conspiracy plot around it. Now, normally, that conspiracy plot would be enough to make it interesting for me, though I am not the type of horror fan big on gore and torture. I will admit, I like the \\"Hostel\\" films a lot (well, I`ve seen 1 and 2, I don't know if there are more). The idea behind them is horrific, yet they also are engaging characters and stories. The storytelling here is so thin, since watching the graphic torture really seems to be what this experience is about, and I just don't get that, myself. Is it well done? Yes, in terms of effects and all. However, it is a detestable viewing experience. Look, I've even seen \\"A Serbian Film\\", which I thought was the worst thing I'd ever seen. It's been a while since I've seen that one, and there are concepts in that one that, yes, are.. at least equally disturbing, but there is also something cartoony about that film. Maybe it's just so ridiculous. And still, it was a more interesting plot, too. This film, it is just a ton of graphic and horrible violence, some of the worst I've ever seen, with not enough of a plot to make it worthwhile. I've seen this film on web-lists of movies you \\"Have to see but will never want to watch again,\\" but honestly, there is no reason you have to see this. There are better conspiracy horror films out there that are more fun to watch. Heck, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is more enjoyable in that respect, say what you will about it. There's just no pleasure in this sort of \\"entertainment\\" for me, and I'd be concerned about anyone who enjoyed watching this.<br /><br />However, if you must own a copy of this, my review is for the DVD \\"Unrated\\" version. Though, my copy has a different cover image, but maybe that's a slip-cover I didn't receive. Mine came with a lengthy, thorough behind-the-scenes featurette, an intro by the writer-director, and the teaser and trailer.it was a more interesting plot, too.

B00A81MV3U|1.0|This movie is filled with four letter words that take away from the story line; not that there was much in that department.  This movie dealt with a serious disease in a frivolous manner.  I wish I knew when I purchased, what I know now.  Vulgar content.

193700788X|1.0|If I could give this book zero stars I would. Charlaine Harris took her great book series and ended it very poorly. I have a theory she might have been killing the series on purpose in hope to move her fans along to a new one. Problem is she lost lots of readers. I will never spend hard earned money on her books again. Are you listening publishing company. And from much of  I have read I am far from the only one. But think of the money I will save ill put it in a high interest account lol. A sad ending to a great series lets all just hope the hbo show does not end on such a low note as well.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|This is a well done documentary.  If you are a Beatles fan, especially if you are a Harrison fan, this is a must.  I can’t even imagine how difficult it was to become the song writer he became, with being in the shadow of Lennon and McCartney, but he did it with great skill and with class.  I always appreciated George’s role in the Beatles (from the beginning he appeared as a quite presence but still had great sense of showmanship and style and his “guitarmanship” grew exponentially throughout the Beatles era and after) but this movie highlights what a good man he was.  I wish he could have stuck around for a while longer.
B0054U56B4|5.0|Contemporary, Gatlin, South Carolina & Savannah, Georgia<br /><br />Ethan Wate has always seen his small town as a place where everything is the same and nothing changes.  Then Ethan meets newcomer Lena Duchannes and everything in his life and town changes.  Lena has shown Ethan a secret world that has always been in his town but he never knew about until Lena came along.<br /><br />Then Lena Duchannes starts pulling away from Ethan and everything in her life after a tragic loss.<br /><br />Now Ethan is being haunted by dreams and visions and he has to make sense of them if he wants to help Lena.  Ethan is now caught in the dangerous network of underground passages that cross endlessly in the South.  It is also the place where nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />Since Ethan has seen the darker side of his town of Gatlin nothing will ever be the same again.<br /><br />This is the next installment of the series, Beautiful Creatures and it picks up where the first book left off.  It also continues a wonderfully told story that is sure to please all readers.  The mix of magic and non-magic worlds and how they affect each other is balanced perfectly.  This story is a wonderful mix of adventure and romance that will make it very hard to put down.  The way the characters have grown even in the short time between the first book and this one keeps the reader from ever wanting to leave this world. There is just enough humor to keep the story from getting bogged down in the darkness of loss and tragedy.  It will also have the reader eagerly reaching for the next book in the series just to see what Ethan and Lena will have to deal with next.  This is one series that shouldn't be missed.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This novel traces the experiences and friendship of two children who meet one another during the Nazi's takeover in W.W. II.  It is poignant and moving as the two boys support one another.  The story is factual and shows how people from very different backgrounds can come together as brothers.  Character development is outstanding and my students named this book as their top novel of the year.  I created an end-of semester project on the novel, and the results were outstanding.  They enjoyed working on their projects and the finished projects were delightful.  Both girls and boys were fascinated by this book.  Wonderful job by author Asa Butterfield.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The special effects were second rate, for a movie in this era of movie making.  There was this OZ character tht ws nothing more thena womanizer, not a tale for young viewers.  the plot equally below par.  this doesn't even compare to the Orig screen play by a mile. the special effects and the overall cinama quality was first rate for the early 20th century cinema.
030758836X|5.0|This complicated mystery was super and kept me reading until the end.  The chapters are very short and written from the point of view of the two major characters, with chapter titles of simply &#34;Nick&#34; or &#34;Amy&#34;.  Some of the book is presented in diary form.  The story is very complex.  Hard to believe that anyone would have the skill and persistence to carry out a plot to ruin a spouse in such a wide variety of strange ways.  I don't have time to read at length, so I kept it handy and read a few chapters quickly when I got a short window of time.  The only thing that disappointed me is the ending, but I believe that it is designed like a season's closing of a soap opera or sitcom, creating a jumping-off point if a sequel is in the future. This novel was recommended by a friend for a book club selection, and it certainly did not disappoint.  It generated positive responses from every member.  I would definitely read other novels by Gillian Flynn.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|If you were to ask me my top 3 favorite genre of video games/apps, strategy would make it on that list. This game puts you, not in the defending part, but as the virus; evolved by you to eradicate all mankind. The creators of this game nailed everything that this game hoped to become, from the eerie yet thoughtful symptoms, to the terrifying but realistic way the virus is transmitted. It certainly drives home that the possibilities are endless as to how it can be transmitted and how it can evolve to different strains. I'm somewhat of a germaphobic, so with that in mind, it is easier for me to imagine how something could be spread from person-to-person. I like how, once your disease is discovered and the more deadly it becomes, the intensity of a cure strengthens as the game progresses, making it an all-out battle between mankind and your disease. The end is intense, can you use your mass amount of DNA points that you get from infected countries and individuals to evolve truly horrifying symptoms that kill in droves, or do the scientists find a cure to decimate your disease and restore peace and hope to people across the globe? DO YOU MAX OUT YOUR DESTRUCTIVE SYMPTOMS AND THREATEN EARLY, or infect slowly, using subtlety and silent lethality to contaminate all life before closing your fist in a single blow? THE CHOICE IS YOURS!

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I'm not old by any standards, but as a child growing up in the 90's, I played my fair share of classic games like galaga, galaxian, and those 1947 plane games with multiple powerups, so I am no newcomer to this genre. While doing my usual haunting of the appstore on my KFHD, I chanced upon this game on the featured nw games and decided to snag it before the developers slapped a $2.99 fee on it. Right away I was flying and shooting multiple enemies old school arcade style flying games. The enemy patterns were similar to the previously said games, so before I knew it, my previous &#34;training&#34; in these types of games had me at level 40 with 3 wingmen, and bright glowing spread shot lasers and quad cannons. It wasn't until I finally died for the first time and thought of starting all over again that the game surprised me by starting me exactly where I died; albeit without my fancy high-tech weapons. Plasma Sky is visually amazing, but still traces its roots faithfully back to the games that started it all. Moving around was effortless and the noises of exploding ships and quick destroying lasers excited me in a way I will never be able to explain! This game is a must-have, and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Awesome pop album.  Dancability is off the charts.  Some pretty cool musical ideas make it interesting from a deeper perspective
B00DB3HJ8E|5.0|First Machiavelli plot drama where main female and male leads are equally Machiavellian.  Main political couple both husband and wife have opportunistic ambitions that they are able to pursue without sacrificing for each other.  Both the husband and wife don't back down when their ambitions conflict with one another.  And in that way they are made for each other.<br /><br />Whole series is like a chess game, elaborating woven as the story progresses.<br /><br />If you like Sopranso or Starz' BOSS, you will like this.<br /><br />I work with lobbyists for the past 3 years, so this tv show fits well in my life.  I think I might have learned a thing or two with these power games.

B000002MUQ|2.0|Sammy said these recently about &#34;don't tell me&#34; : “The record was big. We always sold 4 or 5 million records no matter what we did. But that song didn’t take us anywhere, and I know why now. It wasn’t what Van Halen fans wanted. It showed the darkness of Van Halen, and basically the end of the band.” Well, rock'n'roll's fun and entertaining mission that began in 1954 by Bill Haley's signature song was killed by the entry of Seattle's whiny sound in 1992. Same can be said for Van Halen who failed to deliver an uncompromised follow up to For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Fans were let down. While Eddie argued in press that they weren't forced by grunge to change in 1995, he admitted that &#34;all the songs were in D minor, the saddest key.&#34; He knew what he was doing. Van Halen camp watched as all established rock acts succumbed to the grunge sound, crashed and burned between 92 and 94. They saw the earth beneath their feet shudder. The whole musical scene had changed by 1995. MTV was making fun of Van Halen by showing a segment of Poundcake as &#34;dangerously electric&#34; to advertise its Unplugged series. Rednecks like Mike Judge was making fun of the Jump video in his Beavis and Butthead cartoon. Eddie must've been truly scared. He can't go 100-percent grunge and risk complete alienation by his fan base, but he is also afraid to go out there as the fun-loving Van Halen. So, he hires hitmaker and trend-follower Bruce Fairbairn (who remnodeled Bon Jovi after Van Halen!!!), and together they &#34;gloomify&#34; and &#34;grungify&#34; Van Halen with grungy songs mixed (&#34;balanced&#34;) with a limited dose of vintage Van Halen riffs. This is what they thought was culturally acceptable in 1995. During a Rolling Stone interview Eddie repackages himself as the survivor of abuse (of alcohol in his case) justifying Van Halen's musical mood-swing. Cuts his hair, puts siamese twins on the cover, and a single that looks like a Nirvana video. The word &#34;victim&#34; appears maybe 20 times. &#34;Don't Tell Me&#34;, the ode to Curt Cobain, was the first signal to many fans to part with the Van Halen clan. Hence, Balance slipped through the charts, followed by the weakest tour in the band's career. People started pointing fingers and Sammy Hagar took the fall. Back to the album : The second most unforgivable mess of a song imho is the Poundcake makeover Seventh Seal. It is like turning a fine cut of meat into spam. You've got the gloomy &#34;Not Enough,&#34; and the stone temple pilots-like &#34;Aftershock.&#34; Sammy's voice is a barely audible, coarse mess on most of these tracks. The melodic Can't Stop Loving You, in the style of the &#34;unplugged&#34; movement of the 1990s, is almost a cynical rip-off of &#34;Every Breath You Take,&#34; as covered by hootie and the blowfish. Then we have the two 70s rockers Take Me Back and Feeling (emulating Aerosmith that was also popular at the time), and really stellar by Aerosmith standards, but not so much by Van Halen standards. Back to &#34;Not Enough&#34;: this is John Lennon's Imagine with new lyric's on it and a Joe Perry's Dream On solo played over it. Now, its different when you throw in a Led Zep riff (5150) but when you construct a whole song from classic rock radio, that is con artistry. &#34;Not Enough&#34; must have been Glen Ballard's work.  The Good : One star for the instrumental &#34;Baluchitherium,&#34; whose main riff is a note for note reprisal of Trevor Rabin's Eyes of Love; and another star for moments of Amsterdam—two songs that prove that Eddie and Al are still a creative force. Sadly, from this point on, only bits and pieces of greatness would flow from the once leading fountain of rock'n'roll. Don't get me wrong, by grunge standards, Balance is a masterpiece! just like Def Leppard's Slang is--music performed musicians who'd honed their chops. Yet, these albums sealed the fates of both bands. The grunge thing truly hurt musicians, including David LeeRoth (remember &#34;she's my machine,&#34;? when a humorless David Lee Roth had sabotaged his career almost overnight).  Look at how many failed comebacks  and rehabs Eddie had to go through in the last 20 years. For many fans, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge is the last great Van Halen album: it had wit, humor, delivered by the meanest rock'n'roll machine that was known to mankind on top form.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is extraordinary. It includes a lot of action that is fun and adventurous. It is challenging and will include great features from the old temple run and new ones. The good part is that it gets fast right at the beginning. A great exploding bomb shell game.

B001FBSMF8|4.0|If you are the type of listener who wants the same old Soundgarden/Audioslave/Chris Cornell songs, you will hate this album.  On the other hand if you are the type of listener who likes Mr. Cornell's voice and yearns for something a bit more adventurous and against the grain, chances are you will enjoy it.  It's as simple as that!  Reading the reviews, there is a clear divide along those lines.  I had actually heard the 'rock version' of 'Long Gone' first, so it was pretty shocking the first time I listened to 'Scream' -- I was thinking, \\"What the...?\\"  Personally, I salute his stepping outside the box and totally blindsiding the listener.  I think this is a very strong collection that continues to grow on me every time I listen.  To me that is truly the strength of any album.  As a fan it WOULD be interesting to hear the rest of songs get the 'rock' treatment like \\"Long Gone' sometime in the future (perhaps they are locked in a vault somewhere?).  Bottom line is, Chris Cornell has one of the best voices around and if he wants to experiment a bit, why not?!

B008ODZUN2|2.0|I turned this off after maybe 15 or 20 minutes.  Not much was happening and it was not difficult to see what the plot line might look like.  Since nobody on the screen seemed particularly interesting or appealing, I reclaimed my time<br /><br />In one word; boring.  Or at least the first part of it..
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Sadly the last Culture Novel to come out before Ian Banks untimely death, the Hydrogen Sonata might not be one of the best excursions into the Universe of the Culture, but far from the worst.<br />True, the story lacks some of the great, swooping ideas of earlier Culture Novels, but it is a solid read, entertaining (especially in the abundance of dialoging \\"Minds\\") and with a decent amount of well paced and written action.<br />Actually it is this very lack of \\"epicness\\" that might be the true core of this novel. While the background, the upcoming Subliming of the Gzilt race is properly grand and awe inspiring, it becomes quickly clear that the roots, machinations and actions that threaten the orderly sequence of things are, (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD!) in the end, baffingly trivial, even banal and in the end, utterly pointless.<br />The Gzilt themselves are hardly coming across as the advanced, mature civilisation they would be expected to be. Rather they mirror one of the protagonists, a female Gzilt that is swept along as the action unfolds. Vaguely aware of what is going on, wrapped tightly into their own problems, little dramas and interests. Hardly done with getting to grips with their world but already swept on by a wave of perceived obligation, sense of decorum, ennui and loss of purpose.<br /><br />But I feel that are the points Banks wanted to make. Even in the most exalted realms of his universes civilizations, people are still people (regardless if they are minds, humanoids or sublimed races), people that do terrible things for completely trivial gain, being heroic for the wrong reasons or callous for the right ones. In the end, only every individual itself can answer the basic questions, like \\"was it all worth it?\\" or \\"Did I do right or wrong?\\" (Definitive Spoiler ahead!) Banks refuses to answer, he lets the players come to their own conclusions or not. Sublimations happens for the \\"worthy\\" as well as the \\"unworthy\\" as it never was an ethic judgment.<br /><br />I don't know how much of Banks own struggle against a failing health went into this book. In retrospect it seems quite a bit. And I would love to give this final Culture Novel the 5 stars it probably even deserves (maybe I will do so after a second read). But that would mean to put it in the same spot as \\"Use of Weapons\\" or \\"Player of Games\\", as Amazon does not allow for such nuanced ratings, and I don't feel it to quite reach that same quality.
0062014536|3.0|This was a hard one to rate. It definitely falls somewhere between a three and a four, but I leaned toward three because I hated the ending THAT MUCH. It was such a cop out, at least as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Overall though, I liked the book. I adore Lena. She's a badass, and one of my favorite heroines ever, partly because unlike a lot of female YA narrators, she's no pushover, and she doesn't frustrate the hell out of me. The decisions she makes are the ones I would make, and so it's easy to get in her head and see things from her point of view. Of course that can be a double-edged sword because my heart kept breaking right along with hers every time Alex was involved. I loved their last scene together, of course, but every single moment between them, no matter how small, had me both going awwwww and eeep and nooooooooooo all at once.<br /><br />I feel like I should mention Julian and Lena here but since I was never all that invested in their relationship I don't have much to say. I like Julian as a character, I think he's pretty freaking amazing and brave and adorable, but Alex had my heart from day one and that didn't change with his \\"death\\". I do wish there had been more of Julian in the book of course, because he definitely deserved more closure than he got.<br /><br />Of course I loved all the action in the book. I've come to expect it from this series, and it didn't disappoint. Naturally there was the one shocker moment towards then end that I never saw coming, although now I feel like I should have, and I actually cried a little, although I didn't care much about the character involved.<br /><br />What I didn't like was basically everything involving Hana. Maybe because I never liked her character from the start, and because I never read her novella, I just found it hard to get invested in her storyline. I felt bad for her, definitely, and it was interesting to be in the head of someone who's had the cure, but I feel like those chapters were wasted on her POV. If we had to have two narrators I would have preferred it be Alex, or any of the other \\"invalids\\", but I can also understand what Oliver was trying to do by showing us the side of the war from this view point.<br /><br />So while the final installment isn't nearly as good as the first two, it was still enjoyable. At least until the last few pages.d on her POV.

0062059963|4.0|The Elite was one of those books that had me on edge the entire time I was reading. I loved The Selection. It was one of my favorite books last year, and I was eager to get my hands on this sequel. I can't say that I was disappointed, because I didn't hate it. I just didn't love love love it either. My feelings settled on somewhere between a 3 and 4. There were definitely times when I felt like a lot of the plot was pointless, but the writing was still solid and there was a ton of character development.<br /><br />I am so torn when it comes to my feelings about America. I loved her in the first book. She was sassy, funny and had some serious back-bone and that is my favorite combination. In this book I found myself screaming at her continuously, at her naivety, her stubbornness and her general bad life choices as far as I'm concerned. However, without all of that, there wouldn't be much of a story would there? This book was definitely centered on America's development and it was very well written and realistic. She had to grow up and face some hard realities and while it was frustrating and heartbreaking to watch her stumble around, it is also what makes this such a great story. I can't imagine going through what she is, between the vicious (literally, these girls are crazy) competition for a man that she is definitely in love with and her own doubts as to her ability to lead her country beside him, but I'm definitely rooting for her. Even when she's frustrating, and you know she's making a bad choice, she's a truly likable heroine.<br /><br />Maxon. My feelings for him are so conflicted. While I prefer him over Aspen, there is definitely a large part of me that thinks America deserves better than both of these boys. I hate love triangles, and usually have no problem picking a favorite. Maxon won me over in The Selection, but by the end of this book I didn't particularly like either of them, which may be a first for me ever. This surprised me, because I was even more in love with him after I read The Prince novella, but a lot of his decisions in The Elite made me so angry. While I can see things from his perspective, and to an extent understand the choices he makes, I don't have to like them. And I have serious rage over the way he treated America at times, because my heart broke right along with hers and I don't like that feeling at all. I'm going to try and keep an open mind in the final installment though. I have a feeling that he still has some secrets that might change everything.<br /><br />My dislike for Aspen only grew. I honestly just don't buy his \\"great love\\" for America. This mostly comes down to the fact that he knows its treason for him to pursue her, knows it could get them both killed, and yet he continues to do so and without much subtlety at all. Maybe it's just me, but I'm of the opinion that if you truly loves somebody you don't do things that are going to endanger their life.<br /><br />There was a slight development of the sub-plot involving the rebels, but I remain disinterested in it. I still don't really see what point there is to it, other than to serve as a catalyst to create intimate moments between Maxon and the girls. I don't particularly care whether they succeed in overthrowing the government and caste system. I don't even hate the caste system that much. I'm more interested in Maxon just deposing his father and making changes to the country that way.<br /><br />I' m eager to get my hands on the final book, and see how everything ties together.e in love with him after I read The Prince novella, but a lot of his decisions in The Elite made me so angry.

B00A8MGIZG|5.0|The \\"Matrix\\" opened my eyes and removed all boundary in my thinking. More than one decade later, the siblings did it again.<br /><br />I guess that only older souls, if you will, would appreciate the vision embedded in the movie. That is probably the design of the Universe.<br /><br />Many of us spend our life time focusing only on our physical aspect of existence, without realizing our bodies are simply shells for our souls/spirits to act in this giant stage of life, and to acquire the knowledge, self-knowledge, and experience. We are all connected in the sense that we each are single drop of water in the vast ocean yet we together are the ocean.<br /><br />If we can all live our life, which is just one chapter of a never-ending play, with the perspective penetrating far back to the past and forward into the future, then maybe we will extend more kindness to our fellow droplets during the trying times, and maybe we will manifest more courage when we confront the seemingly all-powerful dark forces, knowing we are as powerful as we conceive of we are.
0525423273|5.0|If Anna and the French Kiss doesn't make you laugh, swoon, cry and sigh in longing, you're doing it wrong. Out of all the contemporary YA out there this is by far my favorite, and really there is not another book in this world that makes me this giddy, or that I enjoy reading as much. Even when things are sad or frustrating and my heart feels like it is going to burst, these characters still turn me into a giggling mess of goo. I love everything about it. It is charming and fun and just plain GOOD.<br /><br />The writing is so beautifully descriptive that although I have sadly never been to Paris, it was easy to imagine myself there. And Perkins characterizations are just brilliant. Her characters, from Anna to Dave are SO REAL. She fleshes out her secondary characters in a way that you don't often find in literature today, and writes some of the most believable teenagers I've ever come across. The intricacies of the way all of these characters relate with each other are also sheer brilliance. Her relationships, from the families to the friendships to the romances are what really make this story, and although they could have easily been superficial or a corny clich&eacute;, they never feel contrived or over-the-top, which is a feat in itself, especially with such a huge cast of characters.<br /><br />Anna. ANNA IS JUST THE COOLEST PERSON EVER OKAY. I want to be her best friend. She's quirky and sarcastic, and yes, awkward and insecure but also smart and just hilarious and even when she does things I think are sheer stupidity, or is totally blind to something I think is obvious (*cough* St. Clair's lurve for her *cough*) I can always relate to her. She's what I consider a Unicorn in the YA world-an actual realistic teenage girl. One who is not a victim to the circumstances around her, simply reacting to events thrown at her, but rather someone who is pro-active and actually living her life and dealing with the situations she creates.<br /><br />And &Eacute;tienne? SWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON. Just his name makes me swoon. &Eacute;tienne St. Clair of the big heart and perfect hair and romantic ways. He's a genuinely good guy and it shows and you can't help but feel for him, even when he (and Anna too of course) is mucking everything up. Their relationship is one of my all-time favorites, because the progression of it is so realistic. Too often romances in literature today are capital LOVE at first sight, and then the reader is left playing catch up, trying to understand why these characters are instantly in love with each other. That's not the case for Anna and St. Clair at all though. While there is definitely an immediate spark, because they have some seriously AH-MAZ-ING chemistry, they progress through all the stages of friendship, to ignoring the feelings and being angry about the feelings and accepting the feelings and then being angry and confused about them and this all actually takes time. Their relationship works because they had to go through it all and developed this incredibly solid best-friendship first. They have to work through a lot of crap to get to a place where they can be together and it is beautiful to see.<br /><br />I think it is also worth mentioning that the friendship that Anna, &Eacute;tienne, Mer, Josh and Rashmi share is now one of my all-time favorites, and the best part about this book other than all the swoon worthy Anna/ &Eacute;tienne moments. They are such a fantastic group of characters and I love how tight they all are. Even though they fight (because friends fight okay) there is obviously a solid bond and a lot of love in this group of people. My biggest hope is that we will get to see them all reunited in Isla and the Happily Ever After because how can you have a book about Josh falling in love without all of his best friends around? HOW I ASK YOU HOW?OOOOOOOOOON. Just his name makes me swoon. Étienne St. Clair of the big heart and perfect hair and romantic ways.

B002ZG9774|5.0|This movie has great music, a good story and the Cher/Christina Aguilera combo. Cher still has it!  Might be a little risque for some people's taste.
B008WCP2KG|2.0|As a fan of Olivia Munn I've watched her do Playboy as well as other magazines without really showing us anything except how sexy she is.<br />I saw her on a talk show promoting this movie and she made the comment that was passed over, \\"I show my (breasts) in the first minutes of the movie so you don't have to watch the rest.\\" I finally saw the movie on a premium channel and she was telling the truth. I tried to watch the rest of the movie, but alas. Even finally showing us her breasts isn't enough to get me to buy this.
8492833491|5.0|De los mejores libros que eh leido! Ya estoy leyendo Legado y la verdad me ah parecido magnifica toda la saga!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Loved it.  Truly did - it was one of those books that has you thinking about it constantly, and you find yourself telling people, \\"I'm reading this book.  It's driving me crazy because I want to find out what happens and instead I have to do normal life things!\\"<br /><br />Nick's wife is missing and everyone thinks he did it.  He hints that he did it.  But did he ACTUALLY do it?  He doesn't say!  So can you be sure?  But surely he did it.  Did he?  ARGH!<br /><br />When the second half of the book kicks in, it adds even more tension and is a brilliant story development.<br /><br />I know some people have complained that it has 'the worst ending ever', and while I agree that it all wrapped up rather quickly compared to the slow burn of the rest of the story, it was a good, creative ending.  I think people like their favourite character to 'win' and feel disappointed when something else happens.  I like it when something else happens!  Otherwise, you've read the whole book knowing how it would end.<br /><br />I loved the fact that it was easy and simple to read with the odd unfamiliar word thrown in - had me using the dictionary function on my Kindle a few times.
B005LZYL3G|5.0|Magnificent, well made, Iconic band presented in a culturally significant time capsule. Present day footage mixed the great sound track and live shows, early days til current.  Love it!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|deeply moving story , totally sung  with much feeling and depth.  opened a window to the suffering and perseverance needed to survive in that time period  for the poor.
B002WSASIC|4.0|Edward Norton is amazing!  He is one of my favorite actors.  It is a graphic movie. Not for children. It could have cut down on the language.
B009AMANBA|5.0|honest presentation of what goes on in congress to pass bills of consequence.  Thank God that they gave all male citizens the right to vote, and that it opened to door to true equality of all persons.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A fast moving mystery and great characters. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Watched a new TV program that captured the story in a one hour new serious kick-off
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Can't believe audience accepted theme of the movie where kids below 14 kill each other. Untill last moment I was hoping the main character will strive to stop this brutal tradition ! But what a disappointment, she just rejoices her victory after all other 13 kids are dead !!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Took some time to get into the story but it got better as I went deeper into the book. Also watched the movies on TV and it was also a good story.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I really Love this game It is different and keeps you entertained. Can play for hours and not get bored.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Wish there were more levels. The different puzzles were great. Would love to try some similar games that last a little longer
B004132HZS|4.0|I loved this modern adaptation of the original canon, which completely captured the essence of an epic literary bromance. Sherlock was brilliant and socially-awkward. John was his loyal and niggling conscience. The chemistry between them was at times schocking, heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious. The first season was slow to build and hold my attention--that dry British humor and long, pregnant pauses--but season two blew my mind and had me begging for more. I AM SHERLOCKED.
B005COO1X6|4.0|ALOT like Stand by Me with increased intensity times 100! Would've been better had it been longer but still a good read.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game. It is so scary I even had my mom watch me  the first times I played this game. You have to get this app if you are a slender fan.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it's awesome.<br />But being able to go to different places is really hard.<br />I give the game 4 stars.<br />I'm saying OMG it's free so get it.
B0000T70K4|2.0|CAVEAT:<br /><br />My FIRST Don deLillo book (and CERTAINLY my last!).<br /><br />This writer does not read PULP, and certainly NOT ESCAPE FICTION. How this  book came to my attention I cannot recall, but it was sitting there, I was ill, and was not to embark on \\"The Demons\\" by Dostoevsky.......<br />It is truly a mystery as to HOW a book as SHALLOW and \\"skeletal\\" as this finds  publishing. Perhaps this was part of a contract to be fulfilled? I am perplexed.....<br />If you look at my reviews you will see that I always try to find something, whatever is positive about a work, a product, anything I review.....I cannot find a single thing to say about this book that is positive. Perhaps that, very broadly speaking, it deals with man's alienation in a \\"proto\\"-cybernetic society? Allright, that is as far as you can go with this piece of TRASH-----and TRASH it is.<br /><br />If Delillo has an IOTA for CHARACTERIZATION you will not find it here. Cartoons are what this book will offer you.<br />The protagonist, a man with more than his share of Sociopathic traits, never comes alive. He's a product of the ghetto of New York's \\"Hell's Kitchen\\"(granted, today another gentrified, cleaned-up area of the city)----- deLillo throwing this morsel at us almost upon closure, and basically an adolescent computer/world currency BILLIONARE who has created an apparatus of intellectual genius/nobodies (paper-thin idiots spewing nonsense) that handles all the affairs of guarding this phony \\"corporation\\" (or so)from hackers that's entirely shocking as you read through ......you are PERPLEXED at the shallowness of this whole mumbo-jumbo of \\"story-telling\\".....<br />Has married an heiress for the title, lives at TRUMP's gigantic monolith of a tower across the United Nations, in a triplex all alone, and is a self-proclaimed one very important person in society-------one who moves around with this coarse, risible bodyguard who ends up being killed by our hero.<br /><br />Dialogue is RIDICULOUS, PRETENTIOUS, ADOLESCENT, pseudo-intellectual, EMPTY, LAUGHABLE...............<br />The conceit is that he is bent on crossing the island because out of his childish whims he needs a haircut-----really an excuse to go back to his neighborhood in a sentimental twist that deLillo throws in to confuse you in the \\"good-evil\\" conundrum that he wants to instill upon you.......A complete failure.....<br /><br />There isn't a moment when you develop any feelings, any concern, any profound interest in A SINGLE character.......how could you? They are merely skeletons waiting to be given life, of which deLillo is pathetically unable to do.....<br />So he provides diversions to \\"entertain\\" you.....Traffic is stalled, his limousine (white, no less)is almost destroyed in the middle of a mob in Times Square, and most ABSURDLY he comes across the funeral of his IDOL---a rap artist gunned down like Tupac Shakur....... And, can you believe it,he breaks down and cries like a baby for his star.......<br />To end this ludicrous tale he finally meets his nemesis in a broken-down tenement where he clearly goes to find, as masochistically as he is, his \\"destiny\\".<br />Strictly for the action-packed crowd that delights in ESCAPE entertainment and whose life is sad enough that they are clearly  terrified confronting ART------that which is about TRUTH, not shying away from what the minority of us finds satisfaction in.......true substance.......<br /><br />NEVER AGAIN.................PRETENTIOUS, ADOLESCENT, pseudo-intellectual, EMPTY, LAUGHABLE...............<br />The conceit is that he is bent on crossing the island because out of his childish whims he needs a haircut-----really an excuse to go back to his neighborhood in a sentimental twist that deLillo throws in to confuse you in the \\"good-evil\\" conundrum that he wants to instill upon you.......A complete failure.....<br /><br />There isn't a moment when you develop any feelings, any concern, any profound interest in A SINGLE character.......how could you?

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great summer read... Very much like his previous books but also very captivating... Everything comes full circle at the end :-)))
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Super easy to play. The game gives you objectives to advance through the levels but after the first few you can just build your reef however you want if you don't want to finish the tasks. Fun game to kill sometime and relax.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I had enjoyed the 1st two books and was eagerly anticipating this one. It. Did not disappoint! I highly recommend this book.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like knowing exactly how much time I have left before I need to recharge the battery. It also lets me know if I can finish the game I started.
B008220C38|3.0|Prefer original backgrounds, as the buildings interior and exterior of those times were absolutely beautiful.<br />It was just to unreal!
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Very entertaining overall. Wonderful production values, easy to follow storyline,lots of action, good acting. There is some gore, but the FX department didn't go overboard with it. This movie is a great movie night choice: friends + popcorn = fun.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|movie was great
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Fantastic book. I loved hearing the dogs perspective of life and is crucial role throughout the story. I highly recommend this book.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Received it quickly. Watched it and was very surprised at how good it was.  Was comparing it to the original movie . TWO thumbs up!!!
B003BPNCLU|5.0|The sony turntable is great to say the least. After setting it up and playing my records on it I was very happy the sound and clarity is great and the price is more than great. I have looked everywhere for a sony turntable and even brought one only to have to return it because of the quality and sound. This is the best. I have had a sony turntable for years and it finally wore out I was heart broken. After going from store to store to try to find one I decided to look on Amazon and was happy to see they had more than I could ask for. Thank  you amazon for finally getting what I wanted at a great price and quality. Anyone thinking about buying one should not hesitate I recommend it highly!!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel has done it again.  Love to see how well he can change from character to character in the different movies he has starred in.  Keep up the Great work.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|What can I say. One of the greatest albums ever recorded. This was an epic journey for the Beatles and a big change.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Love a good movie on history and this one did the trick, Interesting from start to finish.  Nice to see how factual I was. Good Job!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun and challenging, but needs more levels. I had the game completed in a few hours time of playing it.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I received it very quickly. Couldn't wait to put it in and watch.. the whole movie was great from start to finish.  Love Bruce Willis.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is really great and very addictive, it is a must have for the bingo enthusiast and I highly, highly recommend it.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Received it quickly.  I watched it and I was not too impressed with it.  At times it was too slow and kind of drug on. The characters were very good.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|It's not great, but it's not bad. It passes the time, the graphics are mediocre. A lot of texture pop ins and the characters look like cardboard cut outs. The cut scenes are brutal to watch. But with all the cons, there are pros. The action sequences are fluid and fun. It's more or less open world, I like the miscellaneous quests. Overall, worth a buy if you need a game to pass the time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good options and changes patterns with different gates for holding your interest. Well worth the cost to play this interesting game.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love the dungeon hunter franchise. It reminds me of Diablo 3. Now the only thing I don't like about this game r the potions and the arenas that u have to go to. Now I am a level 9 battleworn and I couldn't even make it through the battle mage academy. If any one has any tips or suggestion for distributing skills or starting a new class. I have to delete the game to get all the gems back. Add me on gameloft live at mathwiz 218. Thank you gameloft for making an another installment to this series. Please somebody please reply back. Such as a member of gameloft or someone that is very good at this game. Thank you for reading
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|The story line is light and comical.  The acting is good and the alien is not too annoying as I had feared it would be. I like that the movie doesn't just end, but had closure that worked.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The acting is good and the story attention grabbing and complex. Good perspective on recent wars and impact on those involved as well as perception into mental health issues.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Game reminds me of mahjong, with a 3d twist. Addicting. Guess I could say instead of just having to start over again when I finish a puzzle, would have been nice to have went to another level or started another puzzle automatically.
1594203334|5.0|I picked up this book based on a review I read on a blog, so far all of the ideas in the book are common sense things I kind of already leaned towards but there was research to back things up. Can't wait to test it out on my soon to arrive girl!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A few stories within a story but so relevant for today's society in which there is never enough time!  Highly recommend it.
B000BYRCGU|2.0|The item was returned because  it kept skipping and then would freeze up my system, it wasn't my unit<br />I watched another DVD and it played just fine, was credit back a return, otherwise usually happy with purchases.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|If you like most Bruce Willis movies you will also like this one. It is entertaining with a little humor thrown in.
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|I really enjoy the variety of genres included with the soundtrack. Also, a big fan of Baz. Y'all should buy this.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Ok for kids I guess.....I'm not one.  Graphics ok and will still order games.  Win some lose some as they say.  thanks
0385349947|5.0|This book is great for young professionals trying to understand the importance of gender issues in the workplace. This book shed light on a lot of important issues for women and I learned from it. Definitely recommend.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I was glad it ended when it did.....I'd had enough of these two sick people.....haven't met any like them but suppose there could be some.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Our book club read this and all agreed it is a marvelous novel, full of wonderful and complex storytelling that weaves together.  The theme surpasses the author's purpose in presenting the many dimensions of his beloved homeland Afghanistan and presents the human heart in its beautiful shades of every color..
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|I thought this wasn't a bad flick<br />Pretty good storyline / characters<br />Funny joker <3<br />Would've love a lot more with different villains! Beautiful animation ! Hoping there is a sequel to this !!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was boring.I tried to watch it twice but fell asleep both times pretty early. The plot was a snooze.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Liked the complicated plot, but the writing was all from  the teller's view with very little dialogue. This limited the character development
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you enjoy solitaire you will love this. Great game and a lot of fun to play. Get the app.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I have just started reading the \\"Jack Reacher\\" series of books. This movie ensures that I will read all of them.  The movie is GREAT,starts out fast and never slows down.  I am not a Tom Cruise fan(except for \\"TopGun\\"), but this Reacher movie will change that.  Five stars are not enough!!  If you can't tell, I liked this movie and highly recommend it.
B00A822VDY|5.0|it  is the bbest on blu ray get it now i love my hole family loves it<br />if you dont have a blu ray get on jusst for this moive
1456407872|5.0|I always love to watch the different movies that come from this movie at Christmas-time.  Each movie show Scrooge grow and evolve into a person we all might want to strive to be.  It is not an easy road to follow, but well worth the effort.  Don't you think?
0545425115|5.0|My students and I enjoyed reading this book, even students who find reading a chore couldn't put the book down.
B0024F08UG|5.0|Love lots of action after the movie really got started.  I like seeing ladies treated as such by men, that doesn't happen all anymore.  The ladies and children come first.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Great read, lots of laughs, and I'm imagining pretty real in the life of a person like Don! I definitely recommend.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|MMA fans should definitely watch this movie. It does a great job of pulling you in and has plenty of action to keep you attention.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved Drew! Loved that the story was told from his pov. He made me laugh....total guy. I ABSOLUTELY love books that pull at my emotins, but one that can make me laugh out right, then be heart wrenching?  Incredible. Just read this in one sitting, and stayed up till 4am to finish (my own fault for picking this up so late!)<br /><br />Totally unrepentant guy who falls hard, and messes up... He realizes he's completely in love with Kate and it totally freaks him out when her ex wants to talk to her and he thinks he's losing her... So he screws it all up, takes an offensive position that effecitvlely ends a budding relationship and ends up miserable about it. Eventually he smartens up and goes crawling/begging back to Kate. But at this point she's wary of trusting him... When he finally convinces her that he loves her and won't leave....awwww! And how he convinced her!!!! Awwww!<br /><br />Anyways loved this book, will definitely need to check out more by this author.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|This movie was pretty lame. The special effects were ok and the concept was decent but the story might have been enjoyable for a 13 year old girl.
B00640Z0RI|5.0|A great first hand look from the front lines before the media was &#34;embedded&#34; by the militaries of the world. Read this after it was recommended in the Junior Officers Read Club and it was was a pleasant recommendation. A real look into the Heart of Darkness that was the Vietnam war.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Very slow and not funny at all. I regret having spent money to watch this. The only funny part was when...oh wait it wasn't funny.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Gives a good intro and explanation for devops, as well as an overview of modern it works/should work according to the authors.<br />It is also quite an engrossing read.
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Honestly, the title track of the album pissed me off, and the rest were just as bad/preachy. The Higgs-Boson particle deserves a deep, scientifically oriented song, not a cheesy first grade metaphor (actually, a simile) . Nick Menza is probably rolling over in his rehab facility somewhere, wishing Dave could reincarnate the spirit he had when he wrote tracks like Hangar 18 and Countdown to extinction.<br /><br />The lyrics are like this on the whole album.  There is nothing intricate or impactful here, just cheesy metaphors and catch phrases.  While the bass and guitar work are amazing at times, the drums are drull and uninspired, as are the lyrics and vocals, all the way through.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are some songs where the solos are really good, but this album doesn't stand up next to Megadeth's past catalog with any sort of resonance.<br /><br />Having listened to Megadeth since the 1980's, I find that they were always at their best when Dave filled lyric sheets with angry questions of a political nature.  Endgame, Rust in Peace, Peace Sells, and Countdown have some Amazing lyrical content.  Super Collider?  It doesn't match up, or do anything impressive.  Dave needs to get pissed again, or this band is done for...

0349139059|5.0|2035 was a trying year for most Americans, what with Civil War III and the dissolution of the last vestiges of the ozone layer, but those of us lucky enough to familiarize ourselves with the oeuvre of David Foster Wallace before literacy was criminalized had to anticipate, at least, the forthcoming fortieth anniversary of his second, and in many ways also his longest, novel. I'd read a first, \\"paper\\"* edition of Infinite Jest when I was seven and while it's a challenge to recall that childlike state of mind now that I'm nearing the age of mandatory euthanization, I remember feeling the tome left something to be desired. To any who've felt likewise dissatisfied, I say: \\"The search is over!\\" As explained in the 40th Anniversary Edition's new Author's Foreword (nearly completed between his cloning and subsequent retirement by the Internal Literacy Service), this Kindle edition of the novel has been revised and programmed with a cutting-edge plot algorithm that continually appends never-before-read chapters to the original text. This means that for the first time ever, Infinite Jest is truly infinite. Not only is the 40th edition itself endlessly delightful, but the bravery of Abacus regardless of their probable retirement by the ILS must also be commended. And for the low price of $13.26! Accounting for inflation, this is like selling the 1996 first edition for a \\"penny\\"! You can't afford to NOT buy it.<br /><br />* Paper was a derivative of trees, as any history enthusiast should know.

B003WE9WRI|1.0|Not interesting at all. Felt stupid spending money on it, should have read the sample before I pushed purchase. Yeah
B000FBJFSC|4.0|I found this book to be well-written and very readable. The memoir is seen through the eyes of  a growing boy, and although his home was very squalid and his life very hard, it is written in a light tone. Frank's strength, and his mother's coping skills are remarkable. It is also a scathing indictment of the indifference of many of the Limrick clergy, but a real tribute to the few dedicated teachers and priests he encountered.<br />However, towards the end, I got bored with reading about his teen-age sexual exploits. That part seemed like bragging or using the act of writing this memoir as a confession.

B00C2U6G7C|1.0|In summer 2005, Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins made its debut, and a year later WB would follow it up with Superman Returns. Both movies were reboots of franchises that had fallen into disrepair after series of disappointing sequels, both made about $200 million in the US which was chump change compared to what the concurrent Spider-Man films were making, and both received critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination apiece. But then three years later Nolan made the hugely successful sequel the Dark Knight which made a billion bucks worldwide and a month later, WB announced that they'd canceled the planned Superman Returns sequel and would instead reboot the Superman franchise once again with Man of Steel. Zack Snyder (Watchmen) took over directing duties from Bryan Singer while Nolan, not coincidentally, was given story and producing duties. It's pretty obvious that WB's intention is to give Superman the reinvention that Nolan gave Batman, and so far the critical consensus is that Snyder succeeded, although the critics weren't all necessarily complimentary of this change. At the time of my writing this, Man of Steel hovers around the all-important 60% mark on rottentomatoes which is the cusp between \\"rotten\\" and \\"fresh\\". Some critics would argue that giving Superman the Nolan makeover is a much needed update and makes him relevant for modern audiences, while others would argue that Superman is inherently a less dark and complex character than Batman and that the gloomy, humorless reinterpretation doesn't befit him. I'll let the comic book fans argue over that in greater detail, but there's no question that Nolan's Batman composer Hans Zimmer worked hard to take the film into the same dark musical territory that he brought the Dark Knight trilogy. Zimmer's score, as expected, is dark, brooding, and pounding. What it's not, though, is memorable, inspired, or definitive. Nor is it nuanced and character-driven like the movie. Listening to the soundtrack and watching thefilm, I never once thought \\"there's no way Zimmer could have scored that scene any better.\\" I never thought \\"THAT is what the new Superman should sound like.\\" This soundtrack is worse than bad, it's dumbfounding and thoughtless. It's a below average effort from Zimmer in his own growing body of modern blockbuster scores; it's weak by Zimmer's own standards, let alone the inevitable comparisons to John Williams. Inception was a flawed Zimmer score but at least it sounds like Inception when you replay the soundtrack. This soundtrack just sounds like regular stock trailer music, and doesn't bring to mind images of the most iconic superheroes of all time. This score meets just a few minimum expectations (it's dark and moody) but never rises above those to create a transcendent musical accompaniment that lifts the film to greater aesthetic heights. Given WB, Snyder, and Nolan's intentions to make this film the definitive Superman for the Millennial Generation, this score can only be considered a major disappointment.    I suppose a good place to start would be Zimmer's weak and listless new theme for Superman. Zimmer has stated in several interviews that he procrastinated on coming up with an updated theme, and recently even said he had to delay a full three months while he probed around for a suitable new musical identity. I don't know whether I should laugh or cry that his final product is yet another two-note theme, similar to the two-note motif he used for Batman. I'm also not sure whether I believe that Zimmer really procrastinated for three months on coming up with two notes, but regardless, what he came up with his is far beneath the compositional capabilities he's demonstrated in the past, and far beneath the requirements that a character like Superman demands.  A good superhero theme is powerful, long-lined, memorable, and almost like a good slogan. John Williams' 1978 Superman theme was able to immediately convey the image of Superman and the feelings of awe and relief that he could bring just by appearing. Williams' theme would not function very well in the 2013 film, as Kent/Superman is now being portrayed as a much more complex, humanistic, and introverted character. But Zimmer's new theme doesn't convey any of those personality traits. It doesn't portray Superman's struggle to come to terms with his inhuman powers or his determination to overcome his insecurities. The theme doesn't communicate how Superman is perceived by the people of twenty-first century America. At best, the theme conveys a weak sense of self-reflection and contemplation. Maybe it could have functioned as a secondary motif, but as a main theme it falls flat. At least Zimmer is writing in C Major instead of D minor like 90% of the Batman trilogy. But the theme is overly simplistic and only basically effective and not capable of becoming iconic because it's not capable of conveying heroism, greatness, wonder, or perseverance in the face of self-doubt. Coming up with an iconic theme isn't easy, but it's hard to feel sympathetic for Zimmer when he knew what he was getting into with Man of Steel. One can only imagine James Newton Howard, Danny Elfman, Michael Giacchino, or Alan Silvestri would have enthusiastically poured their talents into this score had they been given the opportunity. By comparison Zimmer seems to have sleptwalk through this score. Make no mistake, the Man of Steel \\"theme\\" is the result of Zimmer lazily working on autopilot and that is just unacceptable. This is a glaring flaw in the score and brings down the quality of the movie itself.    I wish I could at least say that the weak Superman theme was balanced out by a strong Lois Lane theme that could update the cheesy (but endearing) romantic sound Williams gave Superman's love interest back in 1978, but unfortunately Zimmer has decided to write 0 thematic material for her. Zilch. Nada. There is no romantic music on this soundtrack at all, not even for the moment when Kal-El and Lane kiss. This is the second fatal flaw of the soundtrack. Even if Zimmer decides to write them a theme for the already-announced sequel, he has made a mistake by not providing even the smallest inkling of the inevitable relationship in this score. There is no way to artistically defend the decision to not write a Lois Lane theme for this film. Zimmer messed up and that's that. Getting over that disappointment, there's also no villain theme for General Zod. I think Zimmer may have tried to represent Zod with the bloated celebrity drum circle he gathered, but I'm not sure because all of the action material on this album is so monotonous and interchangeable. He did write what seems to be a Krypton theme, but it's so weak and unmemorable in its construction that it's barely worth mentioning; after listening to the soundtrack 4 times and seeing the movie, I still could not hum it now. The third fatal flaw of the score is the lack of a Smallville theme, or any Smallville music period. In the movie, there are shots of farms and pickup trucks and quaint meadows and IHOP and Sears, but no music that could help substantiate the Americana tone of those scenes. Kal-El's upbringing in Kansas is pivotal to how he develops as a person and so the complete absence of music that evokes the setting of fictional Smallville is another blow to the integrity of the music and the film. In summation, Zimmer's thematic output for this film is extremely weak and lacking in careful thought and consideration. If you want more than to be clobbered over the head with a celebrity drum circle, then you might want to consult John Williams' 1978 score, or indeed *any other score for Superman ever written* because I don't think there's ever been commercial Superman music as thoughtless as Zimmer's music for this film.    When you listen to the rest of the soundtrack, particularly the 3/4 of the tracks that don't contain any thematic material at all, you begin to get an idea of why Zimmer seems to be stuck in a rut in this new wave of blockbuster scores he's been churning out. It's increasingly common to hear him produce music that is just stupidly lacking in color, emotion, humor, diversity of timbre, and vibrance. It's like he's so concerned with making sure that his music is dark, brooding, modern, and edgy that he forgets that film music should really be about grabbing at the emotional roots of a film scene and helping to amplify the audience's emotional response to what's happening on the screen in an intelligent and artistic fashion. Listening to some tracks on the soundtrack such as #2 \\"Oil Rig\\" I get the impression that Zimmer thought the only way to write a dark action cue is to clobber the listener over the head with as much aggressive noise as possible. There's no nuance in his approach to tracks like those; it's just drums, churning bass, and more drums. Go ahead and listen to the track. Within 5 seconds, you'll get the hint that something bad is happening in the movie, but the music is rendered utterly unable to convey any more information about the action because of Zimmer's tunnel vision approach to composing the track. As a result, the scene loses personality and uniqueness. \\"Oil Rig\\" would function just as well in \\"Transformers\\" or \\"Battleship\\" because it's so generic. There's tension, but no build-up or release of tension. There's bass and percussion, but our brains actually become desensitized to them with each passing second because Zimmer unleashes their full power immediately and cloyingly. His music for the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and now Man of Steel feels emotionally stunted and monotonous (not to mention interchangeable). When Zimmer works on any of these Nolan films he seems to purposefully shoehorn himself into an inflexible compositional position that doesn't allow for his true range of talents to shine. But take a look at his 2010 score for Dreamworks' MegaMind and you'll find a much more balanced approach to superhero scoring, replete with humor and lightheartedness. Come to think of it, MegaMind is still the best superhero score that Zimmer has ever written.    Production-wise, this score is suffering from the usual Zimmer issues that have plagued even some his better soundtracks. The action music is rooted in the bass region which makes for a monotonous and tiresome listening experience. Unlike his Batman soundtracks, there's also significant treble material in this score, but one could only wish he had approached that material with the same fervor that he writes his bass material with. His treble music here is almost insultingly simplistic and usually consists of a single instrument group playing listless legato lines. The quality of writing in these tracks are on par with what you'd find in a romantic comedy score. Like usual, there are very little to no woodwinds in this soundtrack, but plenty of electronics that break the mood by standing out of the musical tapestry like a sore thumb. The action cues don't have any choreography that guide their progression; it's just Zimmer in ostinato mode, playing simplistic minor-key melodic lines over and over again with fast-paced percussion in the background that try their best to simulate danger and excitement. There are a few tracks where the drums overpower everything else and completely numb the listener with their relentless and aimless progressions. These aren't exciting, they are the musical equivalent of a red herring, something that sounds like it should alert our attention to something special but in reality are far overused and therefore the audience has no choice but to stop paying attention completely. Unsurprisingly, the score makes extensive use of synthetic strings and brass. These sound worse here than perhaps ever before in a Zimmer score and rob the music of the sense of humanity and emotional vulnerability that the film really needed. A violin solo starting around the 35-second mark in track #7 \\"Krypton's Last\\" is particularly ugly, sounding nearly robotic in its performance; it wouldn't sound out of place in a horror movie. There's one track that effectively makes good use of electronics, and that would be track #8 \\"Terraforming\\". That also happens to be the only track I recommend downloading.    Ultimately this Zimmer Superman score can only be considered a disappointment as it fails to form a compelling new musical identity for the superhero. The score is minimally functional in the film by communicating simple emotions like \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" to the audience but doesn't rise above that to lift the film to higher aesthetic heights. People won't walk out the movie humming the new Superman theme as they did with Williams' classic one; needless to say, John Williams is still the composer of the best Superman score ever written. Zimmer need not worry, however, as he's completed his usual round of bull-s***ing with the media discussing how he procrastinated for months coming up with a two-note theme, and discussing how he writes music \\"from within\\" when he really just rewrites his past music with progressively harsher and more synthetic arrangements. Zimmer pulled off yet another successful PR stunt by gathering 12 or so famous drummers to form a drum circle and namedropping them at every moment possible, and in all the hooplah no one will point out that the finished product sounds like it could have been recorded with the usual number of no-name percussionists--but how could Zimmer have exercised his celebrity status then?! And apparently Zimmer was so busy getting his celebrity friends to join the drum circle that he felt it necessary to once again hire a team of 5 ghost writers and 5 orchestrators to help him finish the music for the soundtrack. That's right folks, Zimmer worked with 5 other composers to write a drum circle for 12 of his celebrity friends and yet not once did it cross his great mind to write a Lois Lane theme for a Superman movie. It might be best just to ignore thehooplah that surrounds Zimmer's every move and let his recent mediocre works die the peaceful death they have coming to them. In the meantime, you can enjoy superior modern superhero scores such as The Amazing Spider-Man by James Horner from last year, you can enjoy superior scores from this year such as Jack the Giant Slayer by John Ottman and Oz the Great and Powerful by Danny Elfman, and hell, you can even listen to a superior score released *this week* by going to see This is the End which features a very fun and enjoyable Henry Jackman score. You can also dust off John Williams' 1978 Superman score which contains more wit, intelligence, wonder, heroism, thematic bliss, and excellent live playing in its first 3 minutes than Zimmer could muster in his entire 90-minute soundtrack. Looks like Superman will have to wait another 20 years or so before another composer is given a shot at attempting to give him a worthy new musical identity. One can only hope that composer will avoid the pratfalls that Zimmer has fallen to here.

We are affected by what we see and hear otherwise we wouldn't go to the movies (or rent one or own them). We watch movies because we want to be affected by them. But this is one movie I didn't finish and will not encourage others to watch. I see no benefit.

Maybe we would have been spared the pain of screamo, emo, grunge, and the countless sub-genre metal wannabes who will never measure up to the original \\"darkness\\". A black-heartfelt thanks to you guys, even if this is the last one, I focking love it.

0345404475|4.0|The book is different enough from the movie &#34;Blade Runner&#34; to make it entertaining and to allow for some surprises not viewed in the film. It is an easy read, but there is enough depth to the story that I read it through twice to get the kernels of insight that I missed the first time through. It is a worthwhile and enjoyable book for &#34;Blade Runner&#34; fans and other sci-fi aficionados.

B003VR5PPY|4.0|It took me forever to get to the &#34;good&#34; ending.  And I could only get it through a cheat site.  However, the game lives up to it's reputation as noted on the other reviews.  I loved most of the puzzles except for the very last one.  I won't spoil it for you, but it's really kind of lame.  I thought to myself, this, THIS is the climax, the puzzle of all puzzles???<br /><br />If you enjoy interactive novels, the story line itself is fascinating.  Each playthrough adds another dimension to the story so that you understand more about the motivation and the identity of each character.  It's not the kind of game you want to blast through, it's more a slow burn.  I look forward to trying out the sequel.

B002RI9SC4|5.0|As a man who is not an adolescent anymore but who likes a good deal of fantasy and imagination, this was a discovery! A very consistent, worked out, theory. This is, in my opinion, the basis of a succesful fantasybook! Couldn't stop reading.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down and I have never been one to read soft porn or any kind of romance. I can't wait to read the other books.
B00BU18U82|2.0|The game looks interesting, but its sound is all messed up on my kindle fire, making the game basically unplayable for me.  Turning down the volume didn't work either.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Very good, connects with the Bourne series although IMO the other movies were better. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it especially since when I was in the navy I was stationed in The Philippines for 6 years.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|super addicting game but at tomes will get slow and almost buggy in a way sometimes it only affects the game normally though
B007REV4YI|5.0|I suppose if you are not a Bond fan (or Daniel Craig fan) then ou probably would not be reading this, since you are reading it, then buy this. Is it the best Bond? Probably not, but it is still an excellent movie which I have enjoyed watching. Bond fans add it to your collection!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Did not know how well I would like this based on the previews. I didn't like the doll in those, but after watching it became a favorite of mine.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Watched this on Amazon streaming and enjoyed watching it. Not a movie that I would buy (I usually only buy movies I &#34;love&#34;), but it was worth the rental fee. It had an Interesting story, I would recommend watching it.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|I absolutely love this game. Sometimes the game decides that I've missed the ball, stops the paddle while my ball is still in play, puts a ball on the paddle and suddenly I have two balls in play. I hate losing balls unnecessarily since the more you have lined up waiting to play the longer the game will last. This problem doesn't happen on every game but on about half of them. Don't let this deter you though, it is just too much fun to miss out on! And I am sure they will find a fix for it.<br />Karen<br />I am (7/4), still having trouble with this game, only worse. The paddle literally stops moving so I miss the ball and, of course, it still assumes I'm going to miss a ball (even when I have more than one in play) stops the paddle and places a new ball on it. Is there any way to download a newer version or even re-download this version in hopes of not having the same issues???
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|The training sequence was enough to cause me flashback nightmares about my own experiences in Basic that I had all but forgotten. While I did not see anyone shoot the drill instructor, I am sure that there were planty of guys thinking that thought. This may be the best tring sequence ever done.<br /><br />The sequesnce in Vietnam, the attitudes are well represented as far as I can recall from my time there.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I very interested in what happens next,  almost finished with season 3.  The variety of characters is entertaining,  The acting is great.
B00CFYD682|5.0|After seeing the two video's on youtube several months back (When I was your girl and Changeling),<br />I knew Alison Moyet had forged a union with an electronia/ synth pro and was setting to make something special, and she has. This is a great modern, synth electronia sound but reminds the listener of a time back in the 80's when so much music, especially from overseas acts, like Alison Moyet and her previous duo act Yazoo took the music world by storm.  Every song on this cd is special, all have something that standout and keeps you on repeat listen.  Alison's vocals are so amazing,she has never sounded so in control of a project she's worked on. Guy Sigsworth is a genius on this one, his sounds(brillant chaos let loose at times) and Alison's vocals are just a perfect marriage of artists. They have chosen to blend their talents to make a masterpiece and with all the little touches each song puts on it own little show. Highlights \\"Filigree\\", \\"Apple kisses\\",\\"A place to stay\\", \\"All signs of life\\", \\"Changeling\\", the prince like dance highlight \\"right as rain\\", the modern touches on the opener \\"horizon flame\\", and that voice in the depeche mode like \\"remind yourself\\", to the gothic touches in the stunning closer \\"rung by the tide\\"  With the singles \\"when i was your girl\\" and \\"love reign supreme\\" these songs are like nothing you hear on radio in the states but I'm hoping the video's and radio that has some balls with give these some time to work. I bought this overseas so I've had a month to take these tunes all in and there is no dud or filler on here, just a huge record, one of the very best of the year!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  There was not enough story.  It focused more on sex.  I was not happy when I got to the end.
1606863622|5.0|I am a Nicholas Sparks book virgin until now and I cannot help but wonder what has taken me so long. What a beautiful story. It is a happy and sad book. A book of life and how in its simplest forms it holds love, happiness, heartache and loss. A book to learn by.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to finally start watching this show. I love all the dynamics with the characters. The struggles a professional woman goes through hit close to home.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Saw it in the best selling kindle titles list and said to myself that with so many great reviews, I have to try it.<br />The book was great. I opened my Kindle every chance I had, eager to see what will happen next.<br /><br />I got SHIFT as well and reading it right now, looking froward to Dust.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Didn't like this game at first but I got hooked to it. I just wish you earned more coins on  the missions.  It's a fun and challenging game to play. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and waiting for more levels. This is a game that makes you think, hope you have patience. Very fun and entertaining. I believe it deserves a 5 star rating and some. Very clever.
B004KPX4W2|1.0|Love this movie! As to the streaming- great quality for about thirty minutes, then froze/ partial pixellated at about 30 minutes. Tried starting over, same effect at same place. There was no mechanism to report this onscreen. Ended up also buying the standard version, which worked fine. Amazon, please refund this--- and please re-digitize for the next customer.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|The entire album is incredible.  Highly recommend to any indie music lover.  Looking forward to seeing them live.  Amazing sound
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very engaging characters and storyline. Entertaining without violence sex or vulgarity.  The evolution of the characters and their relationships makes this my all time favorite show. I wish there were more than four seasons.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is a awesome app u just have to know how to use when u download the music u have to get the lyrics or if u want the video press download as video u have to get this it is awesome
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Unless you read the other two in the series you wouldn't truly understand &#34;The Last Colony&#34; so I recommend reading &#34;Old Man's War&#34; and &#34;The Ghost Brigades&#34; first.  Give his books a few chapters before you make a decision.
