B00004RJDA|1.0|I purchased this movie on-line, because I can never find it. It is my favorite movie, I had it on VHS but I no longer have a VCR.   The DVD I purchased is apparently from the UK it does not work in ANY of my DVD players.     This rating does not even deserve 1 star.
B0042U2HLY|5.0|Reissued now by Sony in a cardboard box without liner notes for the bargain price of $35.38 (at the time of this review), this set is a deal not to be passed up by anyone looking for either an introduction to Bruckner's work or seeking to finally grab one of the rightfully most revered Bruckner symphony cycles on record.<br /><br />It was this set that re-launched G&uuml;nter Wand's career in the autumn of his life, and with good reason, as the sweep and the quality of these performances would have made an enviable calling card for any conductor. In the mid 70s, as the retired and -- outside of the region -- largely unknown longtime music director of the Cologne Opera and the G&uuml;rzenich Orchestra, Wand was invited to record Bruckner's 5th with the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra. Musicians, audiences and critics alike were amazed by the quality of the performance and Wand was asked to complete the entire cycle. Invitations to great orchestras around the world followed. Wand would later re-record most of the Bruckner symphonies with the NDR Symphony Orchestra and Berlin Philharmonic. But it is this historic series of Cologne performances, recorded between 1974 and 1981, that is contained in this box set.<br /><br />Wand is an objectivist, averse to any changes in dynamics or tempos not explicitly indicated in the score. Accordingly, this is not hyper-dramatic, fire-and-brimstone Bruckner, nor is it an attempt to plumb some mystic depths. It is simply a straightforward and uncomplicated look at the written score, with every detail audible and placed in context within a larger vision. In so doing, Wand, however, maintains a spontaneity and freshness that other objectivists often lack. He is never as pedantic as Georg Tintner and never as emotionally non-committal as Riccardo Chailly could be in his less successful attempts. Instead, what we get in this cycle is a conductor who has seriously thought through the structure of each work, but gives us music that speaks naturally without being didactic. The Cologne orchestra rewards him with exceptional involvement that results in absolutely gripping performances. Of the set, Nos. 4, 5, 8 and 9 are especially successful and engrossing, and would be worth buying even as single releases. They bear witness to an unusually fruitful conductor-orchestra relationship.<br /><br />As such, I think that Wand's extremely consistent set makes a far more compelling starting point for the Bruckner-novice than either of the two extremely interpretively idiosyncratic sets by Eugen Jochum, or the equally objectivist, admittedly better played, but rarely as sweeping set by Bernard Haitink.<br /><br />No complete cycle is without some caveats, however. And the two issues here are the orchestra and Wand's choice of versions for the early symphonies. The Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra (a.k.a. the West German Radio Symphony Orchestra or WDR Sinfonieorchester) is a fine enough band, but the brass lack some control and refinement and you would never mistake its somewhat thin sounding string sections for one of the great orchestras of the world. The playing is by no means inadequate, though, and what they lack in polish they make up in sheer conviction and urgency. Unquestionably, some of Wand's later performances with the NDR Symphony Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic feature more accomplished playing. But this set has a spontaneity that is sometimes missing in his later performances (excepting maybe the 2001 live 9th with the NDR, which is unparalelled in intensity).<br /><br />The issue of choice of versions may perhaps weigh more seriously against Wand for some potential buyers. I would presume that nobody buys a complete Bruckner cycle for the sake of the first symphony, but those who care may find it irritating that Wand chose to perform the significantly inferior 1891 Vienna version of the 1st symphony. This is too bad, because the performance is so engrossing that you really want to believein it until you run into one of those structurally incongruous passages that seem to throw the musical train off its tracks. Likewise, the 1889 Nowak version of the 3rd may not be everyone's cup of tea, though it is the standard for most complete Bruckner cycles currently available.<br /><br />As with all cycles traversing such a huge oeuvre as Bruckner's, you could of course assemble a finer set from separate releases of individual symphonies. (And in all likelihood you will at some point probably start exploring and collecting alternate interpretations anyway.) But you would spend a lot more time and money doing so, and Wand's Cologne cycle still provides an excellent starting point in the middle of the interpretive spectrum, an interpretive central focal point to recalibrate your senses after listening to the opposing extremes of Jochum and Celibidache. At this price point it is simply a no-brainer, a must-have for anyone who cares about Bruckner's music.urally incongruous passages that seem to throw the musical train off its tracks.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Here I was thinking that Lucas was going to release HD, UNMOLESTED version of the original trilogy. BUT NO! Just another lie to get you to continue funding the destruction of a great film franchise.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Excellent series. For the most part it is very historically accurate and the fictional characters are woven around the historical figures with great and careful detail. A great show for anyone who loves ancient Rome and the time period.
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|I agree with the negative sentiment here.  I like the concept of the rules.  You draw a card and have to build from Lego what is pictured.  The pictures are just too hard to reproduce with Lego.  If you are going to try and play this game you will need to modify the rules--like let the builder pick from any of the 4 pictures so they can make what is easiest.

0765348276|3.0|Despite the title of this review, I mostly enjoyed reading this book.  Scalzi admits his debts to Heinlein, and as you'd expect it's full of classic sci-fi action.  You get a bit of fighting, a bit of dialogue, and some fast-paced excitement.<br /><br />ALERT: I usually never talk plot, but I found it inavoidable here.  There will be some spoilers below. ALERT.<br /><br />You also get some static characters, overused tropes, and a plot as linear as they come.  The dialogue is not very witty (and it really wants to be.)  All the while, I was hoping for a twist--that the CDF wasn't who they said they were, or that Perry was fighting on the wrong side.  Nope.  This book is simple and straight-forward.  (There are more in the series, so perhaps the twists are coming).  I kept expecting Perry's age or acquired knowledge to come in to play, but the fact that he was old was nothing more than a gimmick.  I also thought Perry's feelings on his wife where a clich&eacute;d, and the reactions his feelings drew from others were unrealistic.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--Old Man's War is not bad. It just doesn't do anything new.  Clich&eacute;s abound; my favorite was the angry drill sergeant who is actually very nice to our protagonist.  (And the reasoning for that came out of nowhere).  You have the brainy gay friend who dies and is replaced by the less brainy, straighter friend.  Woman all want to sleep with John Perry.  If you wanted to sum up the plot in this book, it would be John Perry and a bunch of people do something risky.  John Perry has a moment of brilliance and his superiors love him.  His friends all die.<br /><br />I know that John Perry is supposed to be named after members of Journey, but it can't be coincidence that the author and his character are both named John, both are from Ohio, both wrote nonfiction before their current lives. That doesn't make it worse, but I am leery about reading how cool an author's alter-ego is.  It's engrossing enough, and short enough, that it can entertain for a few hours.  I'm not sure how it won the Hugo; though I guess like all major awards it's rarely a reflection of true quality.hours.

B0048LPRCS|2.0|I'd seen Gaspar Noe's previous film \\"Irreversible\\" and I found it intriguing, disturbing, innovative and more. As a result I had no reservations in viewing \\"Enter the Void\\" particularly given the positive user reviews. I liked it very little.    Here's the scoop. Brother and sister lose their parents in a car accident. The two are separated for much of their life through social services. When brother comes of age he moves to Tokyo and begins dealing drugs. He makes enough to get jet fare to bring his sister over. They are reunited which fulfills a childhood pact to never be apart. She becomes a stripper and enters into an ongoing sexual relationship with her boss. Brother has an affair with his friend's mother. Brother gets shot and killed by police at a night club. His spirit then floats around to see all the things that happen before, during and after his death.    This is an interesting movie but Noe couldn't pull it off. There is little or no editing here. It's a series of long, tracking shots, most of which are overhead. This gets tiring rather quickly. These shots are bathed in colors (mostly red) which also wares thin quickly. You just can't see much and can't get into the characters because of it. When the camera does come down to ground level it's not focused and things are still bathed in colors. I kept thinking I needed to get my eyes checked. Then there are the characters. He's a drug dealer with no seemingly redeemable qualities. She's a stripper screwing her thug boss. I didn't much care for either of them, so when he gets shot, I had a hard time feeling sorry for him.     There is no arc to the story or the characters. They don't change from beginning to end and nothing changes in the story either. Things happen, but they're merely a non-sequential series of incidents. There are flashbacks to their childhood which seemed to be nice up until their parents die. There are flash-forwards to various things that happen, and things various people do after his death, but that's it up until the very end when, as best I can tell, his spirit/soul enters the sperm that impregnates his sister. Not really very satisfying.    This clocks in at 161 minutes and by the end I was jumping out of my skin. It seemed as though it would never end. I like off beat films. I wanted to like this one going in, but it just wasn't happening. There are some very positive user reviews here so I know it will have it's legion of fans, but I won't be one of them.
0553381687|5.0|I am very surprised to see such poor reviews. This series, and this author, are at the very top of my list. I have read and re-read these books. the world and the characters are so details and complex.

The complexity and multiple story lines makes for a very long narative, so be warned. In my opinion, I love lenthy, complex stories with many characters and story lines.

I found Martn wrote chldren and woman convincingly, and a female reader I am often disappointed by sterotypical, two dimensional female characters and whiny, stupid children. I also found the castle life depicted to be gritty and realistic instead of flower and graceful as it is often depicted in fantasy books. And, this book is not flowery or kind in anyway. The characters are tormented and mistreated by each other and themselves. The world is facinating and unlik anything I'e seen. The seasons take years. When winter comes, its long and brutal. The frozen north is inhabited by an evil lost to legend, and the winter is coming. boarder defenses at the border are deminished, and no one believes there is a threat. The northern kingdom set to watch the border is lost, and the other kingdoms are all vying for power. I will wait as long as it takes before the rest of the story, and be grateful when it arrives.
B00005Q66Y|5.0|I bought this 8th 8 years after I got into Bruckner because of all the great reviews. I have found all longer (80 min+) recordings felt drawn out and noticeably slow. This is an amazing 8. I am hearing parts of the symphony I hadn't appreciated because they were played to fast or to awkwardly slow. The Berlin and Wand, I really think this is the best combination I have heard. Get it!
B0049JPU8A|4.0|Here is an alternative to The Fray and One Republic (my apologies Fray and OR fans). Unlike those two bands, The Script is more distinctive in sound and tone. I don't find that so with the aforementioned groups. \\"Hmm, is this The Fray or One Republic. Is this a new song or from their last album? Oh, who cares, I can't even tell which band it is.\\"      I do find Danny's voice a bit strained on some songs, just a bit beyond his capabilities. Lyrics seem to really be their strongsuit. Broadly, we can probably all relate to the songs but it seems like each song is somehow about us personally.    Song #1 totally reminds me of Bon Jovi. But I like this song, Bon Jovi, not so much.    As a sign of my age, I prefer the bonus Walk Away than the one with rap. Again, I concede it's due to my age. Now, that song - I swear that song is about myself and my husband. Seriously, it could be our own telenova theme. I should have walked away. Again, I say how personal their lyrics are even if written for the masses.     Good job by The Script.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Saw: The Final Chapter is supposedly the last in the series, and in my opinion, they saved the best for last. They pulled out all the stops with this one. There's more gore (probably the most gore of any 2010 movie other than Piranha), more suspense, and a better storyline than most of the entries in the Saw series. The pace is also razor quick, which really helps if you have a short attention span like I do. And I liked seeing Cary Elwes return. If you're a fan of the series or a gorehound, my advice is to see Saw: The Final Chapter asap.

B0042JTDXK|3.0|Whilst having all of Josh Groban CD's in our collection, we were anticipating the new offering with an air of joy.  Unfortunately this time, we were quite disappointed with the result.  We think a new producer has of course meant a new direction in the end product, but the direction has been rather more of a dead end.    We are not in the habit of making judgements, but in this case the offering unfortunately is so bad in our opinion, that any new Josh Groban offering in the future will result in us listening prior to us purchasing to avoid the disappointment in 'Illuminations'.

1401917232|5.0|Good morning.<br />I decided to interrupt my reading of LHFNO to say that I am pleasantly not surprised to be fully engaged and getting just what I need from its contents. If you have not read Gary's first 2 books. I recommend that you read them first ( it's fine if you don't take my recommendation.)<br /><br />I'm only on page 14, and what I'm getting is clarity. I'm being reminded not to focus on illusion. I am the Whole Kit and Kaboodle and everything I project inside this tiny mad idea of a universe can be seen as the Whole Kit and Kaboodle by extension. God is is  all there is. The ego that I made wants (all the parts, it's autonomy, to make more stuff, to get more stuff, to blame you, to exist etc...) the ego that I made just wants. A Course in Miracles is my path of choice. Gary  Renard's books have been instrumental in helping me make and keep that commitment to myself.<br /><br />Below is the review I wrote in 2011. I was criticised and defended and challenged and commiserated with in the comments over the last couple of years. .At the time, I gave the book 2 stars partly in response to the 5 star reviews that were already here for a book that didn't yet exist. A negative is no more real than a positive review. Once again, thank you to all who interacted with me over this period whether you loved me or you hated me, and now I'm going back to LHFNO LMFAO  on the way. Cheers.<br />Joe<br /><br />\\"I have become bored listening to Gary Renard criticize his critics, and I was flabbergasted when he tried to sell me multilevel marketing miracle stuff. When I listen to him, I find I don't like him very much. This book might turn out to be readable and even enjoyable. The Disappearance of the Universe helped me to navigate A Course in Miracles which has been a critical source for my spiritual point of view, and Your Immortal Reality continued the fun, but this new book should have been published forever ago, and the wait, along with Gary's excuses, has become stupid.<br /><br />Anyway, I forgive him. After all, there are cruises to be taken and luaus to attend. If his premise is correct, he is a product of my ego as are you dearreader, and to paraphrase the first lesson of the course workbook, nothing in this critique means anything. So if I am annoyed with Gary, it is merely a reflection of annoyance with myself which is all fuel for the illusion of the universe I made, and it never really happened.\\".<br /><br />Anyway, I forgive him.

055357342X|5.0|I love these books. I own them in paperback and on kindle. I saw they are also available as audiobokos, and I want to buy them. This book was my favorite of all of them. Ayra, Jon Snow and Tyrion are my favorite characters, and the have great roles to play and plots to develop in this book. I even got to know and like Jamie in this book, which was completely unexpected. Marin is a masterful writer. His characters are complex, as were my feelings for them, and real, his world is intricate and, for me, both fantastic and believable. I feel vengeful for those who have lost, and hatred for the truly evil. The detail is amazing. Everything makes sense and comes to life. When I read these books I am living them through the character's. This isn't a good conquors all kind of series. Motivations aren't always clear or honorable or solely self serving all the time. Bad guys have moments of kindness and good guys can be cruel. Its everything I have always wanted in a series. This one blows all others out of the water for me.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Real basic and simple review here.  I believe most of you would agree with what I have to say.  And that is George Lucas... Stop being so selfish and making us watch this CGI \\"special edition\\" bull crap instead of the ACTUAL original trilogy.  Look if you want to make a bunch of prequels that don't make any sense and are full of \\"crazy awesome\\" CGI that is just to wow the audience and appeal to your own idiotic interests as well as fill your wallet then go right ahead.  But Leave The Original Trilogy Alone!  It is not yours to tamper with and you have no right doing so.  It belongs to the fans now.  By making it and putting it out there it becomes theirs to watch, appreciate, relate to, and enjoy and no longer just yours.  And I, as a Star Wars fan, will not ever buy another Star Wars product again until this man releases the original trilogy In Good Quality.  None of that laser disc quality I don't care what these films look like not in CGI stuff.  The Original Trilogy in GOOD QUALITY.  And if you are an actual Star Wars fan then you won't buy another Star Wars product until he releases the Orginal Trilogy either.  And not to be a complete and total geek, but he is the emperor now and we (actual Star Wars fans) are the Rebel Alliance.  May the force be with us always.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|This is a fantastic, unexpectedly well made crime noir drama that will keep you guessing what happened until the end. This move is high tension and is slick in style and dialogue. All of the actors are great and I honestly can't say one bad thing about this movie. If crime movies, mysteries, or noir is your thing this is a must.
B003KUSUSQ|2.0|This is by far the best eminem album lyrically and musically. Unfortunately, the production quality of this album is so low as to render the cd practically unlistenable. It sounds like it was a cassette recording from an AM radio broadcast. The sound quality is so low that I spent 20 minutes troubleshooting my equipment to figure out what was wrong with my system. There is nothing wrong with my system, it turns out that this album is the latest victim of the well documented \\"loudness war\\" that is plaguing the music industry. If you enjoy listening to music over AM radio and don't mind paying for a cd that will only give you that low fi experience, this is a great album for you, it is truly Eminem's greatest performance on a cd. If you expect your music to be of a high quality, skip this cd. Maybe the vinyl version sounds better since it is from a different master?
B00337KM2S|5.0|In \\"Up in the Air,\\" Ryan Bingham works for an Omaha, Nebraska-based company that provides \\"transition assistance.\\" What that means is that Bingham flies all over the country telling employees whose own bosses are too chicken to do it themselves that they're fired. Given the horrible contraction of the US economy, this 2009 release could not have been more perfectly timed. For many people whose friends and family have been laid off, it's probably too painful to watch.     Bingham spends about a month a year at home in a tiny, sterile apartment. The rest of the time, he's speeding through rental car agencies, airports, hotels and corporate offices, racking up frequent flier miles, firing people and giving the occasional motivational speech about \\"getting rid of your baggage,\\" both material and human. Everything Bingham owns fits in a carry-on, he avoids his family, and his social life seems limited to the occasional hook-up with female business travelers who are as on-the-go and commitment-phobic as he is.      George Clooney gives a career-best performance as Bingham. Maybe it's just Clooney's personal charm, but he manages to convey just enough grudging compassion and decency that we find ourselves rooting for Bingham. When a 23-year-old business school graduate, Natalie, convinces Bingham's boss that the company can save a fortune in travel costs by firing its clients' employees over the Internet, Bingham does his level best to persuade them that's just too cold. It's too good a joke to spoil by telling it in detail, but he also does something to help his soon-to-be-married sister, even though it inconveniences him. I like Clooney but often find his acting a little dry for my taste. Here, playing the coolest of characters, he comes off oddly humane, empathic and vulnerable.     \\"Up in the Air\\" has a fine supporting cast. Vera Farmiga plays Alex, one of Bingham's female business travelers. She's a great match for Clooney, a perfect foil for him temperamentally and pleasantly age-appropriate. Anna Kendrick does a wonderful job conveying the conflicting intellect and emotions of the anxious-to-prove-herself Natalie. Natalie's smart and full of profit-maximizing theory but she's not quite as tough as she thinks she is.     Director Jason Reitman had already convinced me he's excellent working with actors. With \\"Up in the Air\\" he's working with a witty script that's not burdened by the painful over-cleverness of his earlier film \\"Juno,\\" and he and his DP and set designer display a great sense of visual style. This compassionate film threatens to veer off into sentimentality but finally stays true to its characters. Strongly recommended.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I'm just gonna add my two cents: no matter how much I listen to this album, it never gets old! It is a timeless and beautiful classic album; it's themes of hatred, injustice, and, especially, the environment are 100% as true now as they were 40 years ago at the time of this album's release. I believe that this album will continue to be in the pantheon of great musical achievements for as long \\"our sweet world\\" keeps on spinning.
B003VANOFY|2.0|So, I don't usually write reviews but I have to say a few words on this headset. First, I am a huge logitech fanboy, as many people are, but this is the first product I have ever purchased from them where I simply had to return it. The biggest problem is the sound!!! I'm talking about a crackling mess when ever the sound reaches deep bass. The problem, however, varies between computers. For example, my laptop does not cause the crackling and popping sound while my desktop does, both machines are windows 7 64bit. A theory floating around the logitech website community forums is that it may be due to low powered USB's dependent on the users motherboard; thus, for some people this popping and cracking was resolved by purchasing a powered USB hub. So, I went out and bought a powered usb hub, yet my problem still persisted.     For anyone looking to buy this headset, please be aware of the many, many faults that are being reported. Yes, the construction is very fragile for something that costs $160, but, IMO, I can live with that. The microphone voice morphing does not ever seem to work, even after uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers countless times...yet, without the voice morphing the mic sounds like a regular old mic--I can live with that. However, I cannot live with the sound of bombs and gunshots going off on Battlefield Bad Company 2 resembling the sound of Jiffy Pop and crumpled Sun Chip bags. The problem may be in the developers drivers or it may be the headset. Either way, I had to, for the first time in my life, return a logitech product I had hoped would revolutionize gaming audio. The surround sound, however, is good and would be amazing if only the bass popping and cracking disappeared!     Nevertheless, the headphones are nice if you dont care for deep bass. In fact, they are usable in this case. For me, I want to take advantage of low bass, it's what I like. Thus, I use the built in equalizer for the headphones. Unfortunately, you cannot increase thebass (both in the advanced equalizer or simple equalizer)without experiencing distortion, popping, cracking, etc., as a result. For more information on the problems many users are experiencing with these headphones, please go to logitechs main page, search for the G930 head set, and go to the community support forums ([...]). You will be aghast at the number of complaints people are having. It's sad, really, for logitech, I would never had expected this.
B002VPE1OS|3.0|The AmazonBasics Anti-Glare Screen Protector Film pack for the iPhone is like most thin screen protectors for mobile electronics: The concept in good but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The biggest issue with these screen protectors (like most screen protectors) boils down to one problem: Any \\"contamination\\" between the screen and the thin screen protection film causes air bubbles which interfere with the iPhone's touchscreen or simply make the screen look bad when you look at it.<br /><br />Yes, Amazon gives you screen cleaning wipes and a microfiber cloth for cleaning the screen before you apply the protective film, but unless you're working in a laboratory clean room chances are that a small bit of dust or particle of dirt will get caught between the screen and the film ... creating tiny air pockets and trapping the dirt between the screen and the film so you can't wipe it away.<br /><br />Also, since the film is basically just a giant transparent sticker, if you happen to touch the sticky side when applying the film then your skin oils (and possibly and tiny particles of dirt on your fingertips) will be stuck on the film and get trapped between the screen and the film just like I mentioned before.<br /><br />On the bright side, Amazon is giving you a three pack here so you can try again if you get a bunch of dirt on your screen and the protector film looks horrible.<br /><br />The only type of screen protectors that I've used that don't have problems like this are the ones that are pretty thick (which also tend to impact the performance of the iPhone touchscreen.<br /><br />Bottom line, these things work but you need to be aware of the real-world problems that come with using protective films like this.

B003UESJJC|5.0|At last! I purchased this BD containing three discs. Not only the two versions of my number 2 all-time favorite movie (2001 is number 1), but also the highly interesting documentary HEARTS OF DARKNESS by Francis Coppola's wife, countless extras, and a beautiful booklet. I once saw this masterpiece in the theater in the early eighties under the best possible circumstances possible (special sound equipment) and I must have seen it at least 20 times in the cinema from 1979 on, and a countless times on DVD. And now this BD simply looks and sounds overwhelming! What can I add? A great package, high quality, COMPLETE! Thanks Mr. Coppola!
B000002UY3|5.0|Every song is perfect. Perfectly simple in approach, but deep in feeling, texture, nuance, sensuality, beauty, dark haunting beauty... This record, like wine, or blood, only gets better over time. Comparisons to opiates are justified; the world is a warm soft blanket as soon as it starts to play.
1416583432|3.0|I found this book to be a very dry, almost textbook type read. The most alarming thing was that she speaks of giving her dogs raisins and grapes- both of which are toxic and can cause kidney failure! I almost stopped reading right then and there. I would think if the author is basing her whole ideas on the fact that dogs are not human and therefore should not think like we do, that she would also realize that they should not eat like we do. Shame on this author for not doing her homework and spreading some possibly dangerous habits of feeding her dog table food.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|When I bought these headphones in 2003 I based my opinion on web reviews exclusively. Now after 7 years of use (including merciless, extreme usage: djing in a club), they're still in good shape. Sound is as brilliant as new. Artificial leather fell off from cushions though, but it didn't make them look worse or become less comfortable.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Update 2015: finally, I had to replace those cushions, and also I had to replace the plug recently. But hey it's 12 years of everyday use! Fantastic headphones!
1416914285|4.0|After finishing it I was pretty blown away by the plot itself. There is a mixture of everything I love in it, vampires, werewolves, demons, faeries and this is my first introduction into the world of Shadowhunters. If I'm being completely honest the book did start off relatively slow. I was worried whether or not I was really going to be able to get into it. The action picks up about midway through the book and I wasn't able to put it down from that point on.<br /><br />The detail in the book is great. Things were described in such great detail that I could envision myself there at times. From the moment the characters were introduced I had images of them in my head. I love when books do that because the characters instantly become more real to me.<br /><br />Some things that happened were pretty predictable, but overall I really ended up enjoying it.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Wong Kar Wai's \\"In the Mood for Love\\" is simply the most beautiful film I have ever seen.  It is a master's masterpiece,  and the Criterion Collection's DVD does it justice.No matter how many times I watch it, I always want to see it again. It will always   be in my collection.  Don't miss it!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Hans Zimmer's score for the epic \\"The Last Samurai\\" is just that: Epic. With the main theme interwoven in several tracks (\\"A Way Of Life,\\" \\"Idyll's End,\\" \\"Red Warrior,\\" \\"The Way Of The Sword\\") and a quieter theme echoed in \\"A Small Measure Of Peace\\" and a few other cues, this soundtrack is truly memorable, matching the grand images on screen. I highly recommend it.
B003YP7N9O|5.0|I've bought Stand Up several times: when it was first released on vinyl, again after the first LP got scratched up while in college, then on CD with bonus tracks, and now the 2-CD/1-DVD Deluxe version.  I must say I was skeptical - why would anyone want the Carnegie Hall concert on CD, and then again on audio DVD?  Well the answer became very clear upon listening -- the Live CD contains all 79 minutes of the live music that appears on the DVD, but the Live DVD adds 33 minutes of between-song chatter which could not fit on the CD and made me feel as if I were at the concert -- it enhanced the experience considerably, and gave me an appreciation for how great their concerts must have been in the early '70s.  I'm very glad I bought this again.

B00110K62U|5.0|I was fortunate to see Les Misérables on Broadway a few times, but this performance is so magnificent that it actually surpasses the show itself. Colm Wilkinson is incomparable as Jean Valjean; Philp Quast's performance as Javert is complex and powerful. Michael Ball's Marius delivers all the idealistic hopefulness of his character, while Lea Salonga's Éponine is poignant and heartbreaking. Every member of the cast delivers a world-class performance.    The addition of the chorus adds a rich extra dimension, while the orchestra catches every nuance with magnificent power. The staging is nicely done, with costumes and interspersed scenes from the play shown on video.     The climax, with seventeen different actors who portray Valjean from around the world singing in their own languages, could not be more spectacular.     We've become accustomed to the improvement in video technology since 1995, so the quality of the video looks grainy by today's standards, but I wouldn't trade a second of this experience.
B001JNNDEW|1.0|this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all. will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it. language like that does not make a movie!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I've hit the wall, the new author wall. I've read almost all the established fantasy authors, therefore left to comb through all the titles searching for ANYTHING new but that doesn't waste my time.    This book has been reviewed well by many, but the fact that at the time of this review more than 800 readers had left reviews and it still had almost five stars, for a new author should say it all!!    If it hasn't let me include my voice in saying this was a really  amazing read, that reminding me why I read fantasy, to escape into the imagination of another. It has been years since I was so immersed in a story that leaving it was a jarring experience in itself.    The story telling kept me riveted to my Kindle (and completely antisocial) until its conclusion.    The one thing the author could improve is his endings. It did seem the end the story was slower, yet still enjoyable.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I have been listening to Renee's first album for a few years now, and frankly did not know \\"Skylark\\" had been released. I gave up looking after the delays.

I actually like (love) this one more than her previous one (of course it may be I was just ready for new songs).

0156027321|4.0|Great story and makes for an interesting read. You could sit down and read this in a day or pick at it a handful of pages at a time over an extended time.<br /><br />It starts fairly slowly, building up characters and setting the base for the main story. It took a twinge too long in my opinion, but once part two starts it was hard to put down. While the narrator jumps around the timeline, the process is rewarding with tidbits strung together in a related way. The defining relationship of the story builds logically despite these jumps.<br /><br />The end is in a different tone and provides almost in outside view on the story. It makes for an interesting if off-putting conclusion for a great story.
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|I've got most of Lorena's albums and this is by far my favorite.  I loved all the songs the first time I listened to them, which doesn't always happen with me.  Most of the time it takes a few hearings for songs to grow on me.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|The Black Keys have been around for a while and you need no further proof of this than to read the scores of fan reviews referring to that fact with regard to their most recent album \\"Brothers\\". Most detractors elude to the opinion of past greatness lost say compared with \\"Rubber Factory\\", though it begs to ask why that even matters? Is this album good or not? This of course opening up the flood gates for cheap shots notwithstanding the \\"S\\" word (sellout).<br /><br />This album is down right gritty, full of swagger, and full of R&B influences. At many times it is down tempo blues/rock, no particular track is going to jump out at you directly, it's a bit aloof - a quality which ultimately makes the whole body of work very cool. It's subtle, like the difference between wearing Ray Bans and a fitted shirt/jeans opposed to unfitted look minus the shades. The vocals are always interesting, and it has managed to capture that heart and soul of the blues.<br /><br />\\"Brothers\\" was one of the best things to come out in 2010, I suppose that is saying a lot? Who knows, they did a great job capturing everything cool about the 60s, how could that not be such a great thing?

B003BVK2ZS|2.0|This book was probably a decent magazine article, and the opening -- a prison interview with a prolific book thief -- is catchy. But the author spends far too much time talking about what she doesn't understand about the main character than she does talking about she has figured out.     The man at the center of the plot does not love books, he loves items that signal erudition and wealth. He is interesting neither as a thief, an archetype or as an eccentric. He offers very little knowledge of the subject -- either books or the finer points of the art of thievery.    The book is short on endings, too. Not only do we not learn what happens to the main character, but we don't learn about what becomes of the stolen book in the author's possession.     This book will sell well to people who love books, and that's fine. I just hope there is more reporting, analysis and conclusions in the author's next book-length work. As it stands, this book is under-reported, unsatisfying, unenlightening and isn't worth reading, let alone stealing.
1407109421|4.0|I saw the Golden Compass movie first and was curious about the book. I haven't finished it yet but so far it's great! Different than the movie but just as interesting.
0307473708|5.0|I read this book a few years back, but decided to buy my own copy and reread it. I forgot how funny it was. It's a very dark book, and you almost feel wrong cheering on the bad guy. However, a vigilante of this caliber somehow tugs on your heartstrings... perhaps the ones that harbor ill will toward bad people.    Dexter Morgan works for his local police department as a blood spatter analyst. He uses this leverage to take justice upon anyone who may have \\"slipped through the cracks\\" and not gotten their proper punishment. A Serial killer who kills only inside \\"the Harry code\\" set up by his late foster father, a cop, and also the father of Dexter's foster sister, Deborah. You will often find yourself, no matter your moral ground, siding with Dexter. It brings out the darkest parts of a killer's mind, but is rounded nicely by Dexter's disguise and often cheesy sense of humor. Quite a spectacular read. Look up Jeff Lindsay's other Dexter books as well. The series and the books split ways in book one, and there are quite a few differences between them as well, so even if you've seen the movie, you're really missing out if you don't read the books!
B004DCB62M|4.0|The stories still hold up and I enjoyed reading it all.  The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the way the whole book is laid out.  Not all of the titles in the table of contents were active and the icon splits in the middle through the entire book.  It was a little annoying to me but it's fine if you can overlook the formatting issues.
0525951652|1.0|I guess the publisher doesn't get it; electronic books are here to stay. What's the point of having this novel at such high price for Kindle readers? The electronic book is the most important advance in publishing in centuries. Embrace the new medium or die.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|The film is so badly done it completely takes away from the importance of the story.  This is such a critical issue which has been turned into amateur hour.  Please ask Michael Moore to make a doco that people can sit through without feeling sick because of the constantly moving camera.   How it ever won a review or got watched is nothing short of a miracle.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|I am in no way familiar with the original Charles Bronson film The Mechanic from 1972, but that may have actually been a benefit with a film like this. This remake does seem to be targeted toward my demographic though. The Mechanic caters to those who enjoy hard-hitting action films with a lot of blood that spews more vulgarities than you care to keep track of with a fair chance of nudity along the way. Truth be told, if done right those types of films can be massively entertaining and The Mechanic definitely falls into the \\"done right\\" category.<br /><br />Jason Statham really seems to be hit or miss when it comes to how entertaining his films are and lately his work just hasn't been all that satisfying. The Expendables left a really sour taste in my mouth, so I wasn't sure how The Mechanic would turn out. However, this film was actually able to put Statham back in top form since it was able to deliver a pretty great story to compliment Statham's bone crunching fight sequences he's become notorious for. Despite the fact that the dialogue is filled with F-bombs left and right, it fit the overall tone of the film very well. Ben Foster wasn't disappointing either. Foster is one of those incredible talents in his early thirties that most people seem to overlook as having endless potential. As far as his performance in The Mechanic, it isn't quite as powerful as he was in The Messenger but seems to be more similar to his role in Hostage yet refined a bit to leave his true motives questionable.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland also makes the most of his short time on screen. He has two scenes with Jason Statham where he makes two fairly long speeches that seem to stick with you long after his character is gone. That's how short-lived characters in films like this should be; memorable.<br /><br />The one thing the film falls victim to is the shaky camera during fight and chase scenes. It works most of the time and isn't hard to follow, but there were two scenes involving Jason Statham's character where it was hard to distinguish everything that was being shown because of this technique. It's just when two guys are in a scuffle and they're throwing fists or hurling their legs at their opponent, the camera whipping back and forth at the same time doesn't really help matters. Now some guy's dead, another falls to the ground after we hear a snap, and another is clutching his stomach even though we only saw the main character move twice. The technique gets confusing and either needs to be modified somehow or dropped altogether for something new.<br /><br />The Mechanic is actually really entertaining and is very much the definition of a guy film. It's packed to the brim with explosions, bloody headshots, broken limbs, and even a hefty and destructive car chase sequence. The film is worth seeing for Ben Foster's performance, but it's nice to see Jason Statham in a film that isn't disappointing for once. Overall, The Mechanic is dark, gritty, bloody, and just a hell of a lot of fun.ere it was hard to distinguish everything that was being shown because of this technique.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This dvd begins as kind of a documentary, then it continues into acoustic performances of several songs, then ventures into full electric performances. This dvd contains the band members: Don Henley, Glen Frey, Joe Walsh, Don Felder, & Timothy B. Schmit. It includes their classic hits, such as \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", \\"Desperado\\", and others. Also, it includes a couple of songs of forgiveness & reconciliation, \\"The Heart of the Matter\\", & \\"Get Over It\\". After this concert dvd was performed, and their \\"Hell Freezes Over Tour\\" ended, Don Felder was dismissed from the band. This is the last concert dvd he appears on with the Eagles. After this dvd, the Eagles evenutally recorded their concert dvd from their \\"Fairwell I Tour\\", which includes only Don Henley, Glen Frey, Joe Walsh, and Timothy B. Smith.

B001F0WXY0|3.0|I can see how this book was once considered great, just like Star Wars once had the best special effects and the Cubs were once a good baseball team... A LONG TIME AGO. Modern readers will likely find Dune slow paced, overly ambitious, and mediocre at best.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Catfish can be summed up as a \\"slice of life \\" movie with heart and a solid dose of reality and believability.  it amazes me that these clever guys had the insight to follow this interesting and touching story with such precision. It has a good does of suspense and an uncanny insight into the age of social media and it's effects on humanity. With a very touching and poignant ending that gives us a glimpse into the human spirit and a life that could have been compared to a life that really was.  Expectations were not met but mountains were scaled all the same.  The human spirit laid bare for all to see so we can look inside ourselves and realize we all have secrets and unfulfilled desires.  It is a story of unmet expectations, forgiveness and rebirth that I feel should not be missed.  So seldom is life captured in it's most simple and beautiful form. I loved this film and everything about it.

B003Q6D2BE|5.0|ACTION, INTRIQUE, LAUGHS and romance - it comes in fast and furious in \\"RED,\\" a sassy, non-formulaic spy caper based on the DC graphic novel by award-winning writer Warren Ellis.    \\"RED\\" translates to \\"Retired, Extremely Dangerous,\\" a term used for the CIA operatives played by Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren. Just don't call them \\"old\\" as that's liable to set them off - especially Malkovich, a very paranoid conspiracy theorist. Still, it's an old mission that brings in a team of current agents to take out the REDs. Dead men and women tell no tales, right?    Adding to the superb chemistry is Karl Urban, Mary-Louise Parker, Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox. But you'll want to keep an eye on Malkovich and Mirren who steal every scene they're in.    \\"RED\\" looks and sounds great on Blu-ray. The HD transfer provides a sharp and color-rich picture with a fine layer of film grain. Detail is exceptional, especially in facial expressions/skin tones, clothing and location shots. The sense of depth is theater quality. An uncompressed soundtrack highlights dialogue and quips; effects, such as gunshots and explosions, fill the speaker - all in perfect balance.    Film consultant and retired CIA field officer Robert Boer's commentary tops a list of standard extras (extended/deleted scenes and \\"Access: RED,\\" a pop-up feature with interviews, documentary shorts and more CIA analysis). He'll keep you listening while detailing what's real and what's not in the film and sharing his experiences such as, \\"When you return from an assassination attempt on Saddam Hussein and find the FBI waiting to arrest you, it's time to retire.\\"    By the way, he says there's no such CIA category as RED - but maybe there should be!

B003Q6D282|3.0|**SPOILER FREE**<br /><br />  Words cannot begin to express how dissatisfying SAW 3D was to a avid fan of the entire franchise. From the unlikable characters to the over the top actors who played them. Saw 3D was a HUGE mess. Do not worry about anything being spoiled as all my reviews are spoiler free (Despite knowing almost 1 minute in the movie what to expect). I'll let you find out for yourself.<br />  For starters I have always loved the SAW franchise. It has always been my guilty pleasure. While my movie standards are usually set fairly high I have always had a soft spot for SAW (Maybe because each movie had so many intricate plot details and I loved that). My favorite of the series was a tie up between 3 and 4 as I felt things started to really get complex at that point, this wasn't your average Freddy or Jason movie. SAW 5 and 6 were considered mild dissapointments to me but I still loved them nonetheless. I guess I was too anticipating Dr. Gordon making his return that whatever twist the movies had wasn't as good as what I secretly wished it would be. So finally in SAW 3D Dr.Gordon comes back and completely WASTES his return back to the franchise. To be fair it wasn't Carys (Gordon) acting as much as the script he was given that completely was garbage. With lines from \\"Main\\" Characters such as \\"You think im stupid huh, STUPID!\\" you will understand why this movie is a complete dud.<br />  Apart from the god awful dialog the characters were SO unlikeable! To this day I remember every \\"Detectives\\" name from a SAW movie, except for SAW 3D. I HATED (I cannot stress that word enough) the \\"Main\\" character of the movie. Such an unlikable person you practically beg Jigsaw to just kill him already. Absolutely NO redeeming qualities whatsoever and NO he was not written that way he is just a really bad character.<br />  My second big complaint was the lack of thought into the traps. I felt that SAW 3 had the best traps that just made you cringe at not only how violent they were but about the symbolism behind the majority of them. In SAW 3D each trap is designed to \\"pop out\\" at you (the movie was made for 3D audiences but I am sure you all know that) and every trap just involved something sharp pointing at the audience. Hoffman even has a dream at one point about Killing Jill Tuck by having some weird pointy blade thing just fly across the room and stab her. Yes these traps were completely diluted of any thought at all. I would laugh if the directors really thought they were being innovative.<br />  BUT my biggest clause is with the return of Gordon and the way his character is so obviously used from the very start of the film. I'll let you see for yourself.<br /><br />  To be fair the movie is not completely terrible as a horror movie but lacks the \\"heart\\" (terrible word I know) that a SAW movie would have. The movie managed to rack in 3 stars from me because 1) it is SAW 2) Gordon did come back, even if I was upset how he was used, and 3) I was entertained by this movie (just not in the way every other SAW movie has entertained me with there complexity.<br /><br />I hope you give the movie a shot though because as a SAW fan it is definitely worth a rental at best.the symbolism behind the majority of them.

0689865384|5.0|I'm always finding young adult books that I would have loved when I was younger. Unfortunately, most of the time the writing is too immature and easy to read now that I'm older(23). I didn't have that problem with the Uglies series at all! It was a fairly fast read, but not too quick. I was totally engrossed in it, and it's an eerily truthful representation of our society today, or at least where it sometimes seems to be heading. A great introduction to dystopian novels, I'd recommend this to all readers, from junior high and beyond.

B003A9OVS0|5.0|Why do so many people complain about this album, especialy gorillaz fans? Some people say its because thier \\"sound has changed\\" or whatever well I think those people are a bunch of whiners. to me change is good and I hope you agree.the thing is that gorillaz don't have a sound they are experimental they like to try new things and different genres. This album is great I like all the songs on it and it is well worth the money I have paid for it.In my honest opinion this could posibly be the best gorillaz album yet, it's fun, Catchy, and very different to other albums out there. There is only ONE track on this album that I do not care fir that much and that is, sweepstakes but the rest are great and all the collaborators on this album make it even better. My favorite songs on this album are pirate jet, plastic beach, rhinestone eyes, stylo, and some kind of nature. If you are a Gorillaz fan and do not have this album than you should get it you wont be dissapointed. I think this album deserves an award of some sort for all the hard work and great sound put into it. The vocals beat that of ke$ha and justin beiber by a mile. Not many groups these days are as talented or unique as gorillaz are. So what are you waiting for? Get the album!

B00005JLWN|2.0|This dystopian movie envisages a world where emotion is illegal.  Oddly, those in power get angry when people break the law, but don't seem to notice it.  So the whole premise of the movie is incoherent.  The aesthetic style of the movie -- rooms without any color, huge buildings apparently modeled on totalitarian regimes -- is so over the top that it is ridiculous.    The plot details are so absurd it is funny -- seeing Bale stare into the eye of a little dog and have is heart broken is laughable.  Similarly, having the Mona Lisa represent a moving work of art is very strange.  The many scenes where Bale fights about 30 other people and kills them all are completely unbelievable.  The director says in the commentary that they ran out of money, which is apparent, but that does not explain the crappy and incoherent plot.  Some people like the acting of Christian Bale, but I've never seen him convincingly show an emotion, even when he is winning at the Golden Globes, so he is not the best choice to be the lead actor in a role where he is meant to be the overcome by experience of emotion.  The best thing about the DVD is the director's commentary where he gives a lot of excuses for why his first movie was such a failure.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|shiver and linger are two very awesome books about grace and sam,although some people may think their werewolf and girl romance is a knockoff of twilight.it is not.....it is so much more.after reading it on my kindle i had to buy this book so i could cherish it forever.thank u and a well done job to maggie steifvater!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|Ever since my 3 year old daughter saw the first preview for this movie she has asked at least once per week if she could watch it.  I rented it on release day, and thankfully decided to watch it by myself first just to make sure it was age appropriate.  This movie is way to disturbing for children.  The demons that the Voodoo doctor calls forth from the \\"other side\\" would give any child nightmares.  I would not recommend this movie for any age group.
B004E547D8|1.0|Bought this on pre-order, assuming that a new release disc with HD video would have HD audio, just like every other BRD I have ever bought has, well the studio tried to pull a fast one, I assume to push people toward the more expensive SE disc, well I don't want all the extra cr*p, just HD audio and HD video, now they will get none of my $ and Amazon will pay for a return. Hopefully this deceitful tactic doesn't become the norm.
B002ZG999U|1.0|Only view this movie if you don't need to buy it. The most unbelievable part of the movie is at the time I wrote this over 80 people had given it 5 stars. The use of Bruce and Arnold was a total come on and served only to devalue the movie. I wish I had borrowed this from a library instead of paying for it. This movie was definitely expendable.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|when i read the Hunger Games i was totally blown away.  when i read Mockingjay i thought it sucked.  i mean, whats the point of writing a book about a girl if the girl doesn't even participate in the climax? she was knocked out for most of it.  i think that prim should have died during the middle of the book so that katniss would escape district 13 with Gale and go to the capitol and kill a bunch of people and kick some ass. she would kill snow and everyone would love her. and then she would go home and peeta would be completely well again and then they would kiss then you stop the book and go to the epilogue. (gale would fall for some other chick) and the whole district thing would end and everyone will be simply called Panem and there would be no stupid fences and they all lived happily ever after, the end........ BUT THAT DiDNT HAPEN!!  katniss is knocked out and partly insane so she is chucked to district 12. gale ditches her for district 3 or 4 (i forget) and her mom isnt allowed to see her only remaining kid again and you have no idea what the hell happened to the rest of the world!! you just see poor old pathetic katniss with deranged peeta trying to get over her life.  shes a pathetic mess who cant control her own life. others live it for her.  what a waste of paper.  (if u want to read a really good book with a heroic hero and a spectacular ending and an epilogue, READ HARRY POTTER!  have fun reading! (but dont read this book) &#60;3

B0049P1VHS|4.0|I greatly enjoy the show, but the advisor for military effects should be fired.     Attention to detail: Episode 1 and 2 has a CB radio installed in an M1A1 main battle tank. The US military does not use CB radios and therefore there are no mounts for them in their vehicles nor means to power them. Episode 1 has dead US soldiers on the M1A1, one wearing DCUs (Desert Camoflage Uniform), that uniform was phased out and is not worn by personnel while in the US. Episode 6 shows a heavy machinegun emplacement with a DShK heavy machinegun. Problem is, the DShK is a Russian heavy machinegun, not used by the United States and our ammunition is not usable in the DShK. There is a glaring lack of dropped M4s, M16s and M249s amongst the dead soldiers. Also, the General that would use Main Battle tanks as a defense for a street or area around the CDC or other city areas rather than razorwire, HMMWVs and/or M2/M3 Bradleys deserves to be eaten by zombies.    That said, I strain to ignore the lack of attention to detail and enjoy the show as best as possible.
B00461MY30|2.0|I love The Rolling Stones and bought all their records brand new as soon as they were released.  That makes me older..  The original label was London Records and the covers were great, especially the English imports!  These covers are not very good.  They should have put more design effort into each one.  When you pay almost $300 for a boxed set you should get quality beyond the vinyl it self.
1423113497|4.0|Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have your father be Poseidon God of the Seas?  Well that's who Percy Jackson's father is. The Lightning Thief is the epic first book of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians saga, and Rick Riordan does an amazing job of describing the books characters and problems.  It's a great adventure book.   Zeus, God of the Sky blames Poseidon's son, Percy of stealing his master lightning bolt. Zeus gives Percy till the Summer solstice to return it to him. Percy with the help of his friends Annabeth and Grover set off to find Zeus's master bolt... in the Underworld. They face many challenges along the way, including monsters and Gods like Medusa and Aries. Will Percy recover the bolt in time? You will have to read it to find out.    I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I've read a bunch of books in my life and this one would be on my top 5 list. Rick Riordan is a great adventure writer, he made me laugh and he surprised me a lot.    I recommend this to all readers, whether you believe in the Greek gods or not it's a great book. I recommend this book to all because it's a great adventure book. If you are in the mood for a good pick this one up and see if it's right for you.
0525951652|5.0|It's a physically heavy book; but a great read.  The book covers 1905-1923, but centers on World War I and the Russian Revolutions.  I must say that it was refreshing to see the German viewpoint of the First World War as well as the British and the American. I had been taught in high school that \\"The war-mongering Kaiser Wilhelm and his war-mongering generals caused the war.\\" The causes were more convoluted than that - and more convoluted than this novel showed; but it shows plausibly what people in the different countries and classes believed and how they experienced that war.<br />The viewpoint transitions were smooth.  The characters were plausible and tri-dimensional - more so than in Edward Rutherford's book about New York City (but Mr. Rutherford had to cover 500 years in 800 pages - hard to get in-depth characterization.) [[ASIN:0345497422 New York: The Novel]]<br /><br />I regret that Mr. Follett did not append a bibliography of his research sources.  How can we evaluate the book's historical plausibility without reading what the author used to make his points?  Other than that, I say this is a book worth pondering over.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I watched this movie very reluctantly, as I usually do not like horror-remakes. The form has become incredibly trendy, and the remakes rarely hold a candle to the originals. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the remake of \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\".<br />  First of all, as the viewer, you need to know what you are getting into here when you are watching this film. If you aren't familiar with the original 1978 film, it was an absolutely brutal exploration of rape and revenge. The remake actually stays fairly close to the original, except the remake was filmed 32 years later, which means that the violence and the sexual assaults have been elevated to an absolutely extreme level. As far as I'm concerned, AWESOME! Yet, I know that lots of people are going to call this film \\"trash\\" or \\"porn\\" simply because it deals with the topic of brutal rape. There are plenty of ghastly and grisly images in modern horror films, yet everyone seems to think that rape is absolutely the most offensive and the worst violence you can commit to film. To me, it's not much different from the type of violence you would find in films like \\"Saw\\" (series), \\"Hostel\\" (series), \\"Martyrs\\", \\"Frontier(s)\\" \\"Inside\\" or \\"The Human Centipede\\". But, I know some people just can't handle something about rape scenes. If you are one of these people, you need to search elsewhere for entertainment. Even though the sexual assault scenes really don't take up that much screen time, they are pretty degrading and nasty (nothing like you'd see in \\"Irreversible\\", but this film's sexual assaults can keep up with about any other rape you've ever seen on film). DO YOU THINK I'M SICK YET?? Hahaha, ok, maybe you have a point. However, I'm not especially thrilled watching rape scenes in horror. To me, it's not very creative, although it has an incredible power to shock people. Yet, I was actually way more uncomfortable watching the rest of the violence in the film. I'm trying not to write any spoilers, but let's just say there are some \\"traps\\" that the \\"Saw\\" franchise would be jealous of. Absolutely vicious. This was the most satisfying element of the film for me. If you like your horror tough and brutal, you very well may like this film.<br />  You must remember a few other things going into this film. This is not the kind of film that's going to get critical praise. The plot is virtually non-existent. Or at least, it's very, very simple. I didn't find this to be a huge problem, because the sequence of events in the film form the story. The dialogue is INCREDIBLY cheesy, to the point of making your skin crawl as much as the violence in the film. Also, the acting is somewhat sub-par (with the exception of Sarah Butler's performance in the lead role). It's the only element of the film that doesn't seem real, which I think detracts from the overall value of a serious horror film. There's also a loose end that isn't tied up at the end of the film, which left me scratching my head wondering why they didn't address what happened to this particular character. These problems are very common in horror films (as most people know), so if you know what you're about to watch and you allow yourself to be entertained, these little problems don't seriously detract from the overall experience of the film. These few negative elements led me to give this film 3.5 stars instead of 4.5, which it would have earned simply for the level of violence and intensity. Overall, as far as horror-remakes go, this one is one the better ones, IMO. I probably still like the original better, due to the novelty of 70's horror films, but I'd actually say it's a fairly close race, and I never say that about these remakes. If you are a fan of this type of cinema, I'd say it's definitely worth a view. 3.5 stars.there are some \\"traps\\" that the \\"Saw\\" franchise would be jealous of. Absolutely vicious.

B003YFIUW8|1.0|Truly disappointing. Heard about it from multiple \\"Best of 2010\\" lists, so I dove in. The first half was interesting, new, different. But the second half was mundane, boring, pointless and ultimately made the whole book hugely disappointing.  The promise of the first half makes the second half that much more painful.  My advice: don't waste your time, or money.
B003VPAX4Y|5.0|In 2003 (and at considerable expense) I bought the 'Superbit' DVD of this wonderful film to get the best picture quality I could and it was far better than the standard DVD version (even though it didn't have the extras the standard DVD did). But this January 2011 BLU RAY (UK) reissue with its superlative picture quality AND nicely complimentary extras - trumps all previous formats. And it's reasonably priced too. But to the details first...<br /><br />PRINT/FEATURES:<br />Full 1080p High Definition Widescreen Transfer - 2:35 Aspect<br />The \\"My Scenes\\" function allows the viewer to pinpoint a part of the movie you particularly like by pressing the Green button on your remote for the start and the Blue button to end it (only as it is playing).

So many things came together on this film - the inspired casting of Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes as Viola De Lessops and William Shakespeare, Geoffrey Rush as the permanently living-on-the-edge theatre owner Philip Henslowe (his dialogue titles this review), Colin Firth as the dastardly and arrogant Lord Wessex (wittily refers to life in 1593 as \\"Dallas in frocks\\"), right down to the ordinary-people emotion of Imelda Staunton who is superb as Viola's nurse. In fact the entire ensemble cast (Tom Wilkinson, Martin Clunes, Rupert Everett, Jim Carter and Simon Callow) are all superlative and add hugely to its overall classy feel. There's John Madden's assured direction (he did \\"Mrs. Brown\\"), the beautifully evocative score by Steven Warbeck, the 17 fully reconstructed buildings and two theatres created by the Production teams and of course the movie's true ace-in-the-hole - the stunning screenplay by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman which successfully emulates the bard's genius while at the same time making him real and human to us. Back in late 2007 I posted a List in Listmania on Amazon UK called \\"25 Movie Dialogues You Must Hear Before You Die\\" - and number 6 is the scene where Paltrow talks of love to her nursemaid as she readies for bed (\\"...love that will overthrow mountains...come ruin or rapture...\\") - it's sensational stuff and in modern-day speak equal to the bard himself (no mean feat).<br /><br />ASPECT/PICTURE QUALITY:<br />This Blu Ray's default setting is 2:35 aspect (puts borders on the top and bottom of the screen automatically), but I found taking it to full-screen on my Sony didn't distort or stretch the image too much - if at all. But the real deal here is the picture quality itself - which is never less than brilliant and at times truly beautiful. The most obvious and immediately noticeable thing is the costumes. There's a scene where the 'players' are finally staging \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" in front of a rapt audience at 'The Curtain' - it cuts to Colin Firth hanging from the rafters watching his new wife play Juliet and then cuts to Joseph Fiennes as Romeo on the stage opposite Paltrow - the colours in their clothes is just awesome. Even on the indoor scenes, the lighting is fabulous - little or no blocking - a hugely enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Niggles - the extras are essentially the same as the DVD - the 20-minute 'Making Of' is particularly good and includes interviews with all the key people behind the camera and in front of it (as well as other actors already mentioned Judy Dench and Ben Affleck are also included) - but it's a shame there wasn't more dug out for this reissue. It deserved it. A minor point, but one worth making...<br /><br />This BLU RAY reissue of \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" is a triumph - a romantic, funny and hugely uplifting film finally given a chance to shine - and with a gorgeous print.<br /><br />In the words of the great man himself (from Sonnet 18):<br />\\"So long as men can breathe or eyes can see<br />So long lives this, and this gives life to thee...\\"minute 'Making Of' is particularly good and includes interviews with all the key people behind the camera and in front of it (as well as other actors already mentioned Judy Dench and Ben Affleck are also included) - but it's a shame there wasn't more dug out for this reissue.

B003TXKSWK|4.0|I'm a huge fan of The Roots and John Legend so this CD seemed like it was too good to be true. I was a little disappointed, though. It is a great CD on the whole, but not many songs really stick out in my mind. It can even feel a little preachy, but I really enjoyed it. These two are the most under-appreciated artists in Black Music, and this cd shows why. I recommend it, but know its not like either's old stuff really.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|There have been many editions of this out there. This is a really good one, of a very poignant subject, that never goes away!
B0049OSQ18|4.0|I had never heard the Decemberists before, but a clerk from a music store I shop at a lot told me to check them out. I actually liked it. Sometimes it feels a little too country, but its not like the bad, generic country out there. I was pleasantly surprised, I will most likely check out some of their older music, now. I highly recommend the CD, it was very good on the whole, and I enjoyed most songs on there.

B001TOD9VI|4.0|`The Wrestler' is the film that has catapulted Mickey Rourke back into the limelight and with good reason. It is pretty obvious from the get go that we are in for a great performance. Following a `has been' wrestler who tries to maintain his former glory in various weekend bouts, this film paints quite a sad picture at times. Rourke plays the part excellently where you can't help but like the main character despite obvious flaws. The sub plot where he falls in love with an aged stripper, and tries to date her, mirrors his own physical demise amongst younger, more athletic and often more extreme wrestlers. This film may mean more if you know of the big eighties and nineties wrestlers, but to be honest this is a film about one mans struggle to keep doing the thing he loves and find some meaning in his life and the wrestling theme is merely a vehicle for that. The final scene is actually quite touching and you are left impressed by the acting from all involved throughout the film. This film was reminiscent of the Rocky films (especially Rocky Balboa), due to the run down locations and style of direction and it easily deserves a place up there with other great sporting themed films from the past. A solid effort from all involved and well worth a watch.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00013F35I|4.0|`Live In Barcelona' is a DVD of Bruce in concert performing many of the songs from his excellent `The Rising' album, as well as a selection of other tracks to round things off nicely. The direction is very good and it still puts a smile on my face to see the E-Street band backing Bruce as he growls and parades around the stage. From the copious amounts of sweat that pours out of his body you can tell he puts his all into every performance and although I wasn't there at this particular concert I can say that he really is this dedicated and energetic from the concerts I have seen him at. The sound quality may not be the greatest, as noted elsewhere here, but the overall package is so good I find it hard to deduct too many stars for this. If you want to see what Bruce is like in concert then this is a good DVD to buy, I can only hope that I can slide across the floor on my knees like he does when I am his age!!!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00338QENI|5.0|I have literally just finished reading this book on my kindle. It is 12:08 am. My cheeks are stained with streaks of dried tears, and I am beyond words. I am rivetted, inspired andin awe. &#34;Miss Rebecca&#34; has done such a wonderful job in humbly weaving together the story of the Lacks family. She has depicted it in such a way that i found myself forgetting this was a work of non fiction. I was so drawn in by every person, feeling their pains, seeing their tortured eyes, and laughing along with their joys.<br /><br />I am heart broken by parts of this book, but I am so deeply touched by a family I will never know. I want to commend Rebecca for having the courage to take on a story of this magnitude and do it such justice. All those who assisted her in large and small ways deserve so much for immortalizing this family on the pages of this book. I feel strongly that this author brought the human element to this story in a way that only she could. i desperately hope that she will always remember what she learned from this family and she will always keep faith.<br /><br />I am 22 years old with no medical background, and I was ble to thouroughly enjoy this book. Do not let its subject matter deter or intimidate you. The spirit of this book, of this family is alive in this book and jumps off the pages at you. Everything happens for a reason. I am so glad Rebecca Skloot followed her calling.<br /><br />Jeremiah 29:11 &#34;For I know theplans I have for you, says the Lord, Plans to prosper you...&#34;
B0000E1ALR|4.0|Having purchased all three Springsteen compilations (original `Greatest Hits', `The Essential...' and later `Greatest Hits`) I have to say that `The Essential Bruce Springsteen' is probably your best bet for your first try of what he has to offer. You get a wide selection of tracks across two CD's that are fairly representative of what his music is like. Any compilation is going to create argument about inclusions and songs left out and I am sad to see `Murder Incorporated' missing for example, but the remaining tracks more than make up for any personal opinions on running order. This album is good because it offers up the obligatory crowd pleasers like 'Born to Run' and 'Born in The U.S.A`. etc, but it also shows some of Bruce's earlier work which is quite folky and less popular, as well as `The Ghost of Tom Joad' (which I love) from the acoustic album of the same name. There is a wide spread of his careers work, as well as the excellent new live tracks from `Live in New York'. The booklet is as good as on all his previous albums and provides all the lyrics and shows how good they actually are. In fact people are often surprised at the depth of his writing if all they are used to is the stadium rockers. This limited edition version has a third disc with rare demo's and outtakes on it and is worth hunting down if you want all his albums or if you want to hear some of his more obscure stuff. There are tracks from various films , as well as live tracks. To be honest some of the songs on the third disc are a bit hit and miss, but `Lift Me Up', `Code of Silence' and the acoustic version of 'Countin' on a Miracle' all stand out and make it worth paying extra for this version. If you are a fan of Bruce then this is a great place to go for a selection of his best tracks in one place and if you are new to his work then this will be the start of one amazing ride!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001P9KR94|4.0|`Slumdog Millionaire' is the story of a poor Indian man, who grew up in the slums of Mumbai and who goes on to star in India's version of Who Want to be a Millionaire. It is told in flash backs, with each part of his life history linked to the question being asked on the gameshow. This is a novel way of progressing both stories and explained his motivation to be on the show in the first place. This film was marketed in the trailers as quite a light hearted affair, but in reality it is quite dark in places and very gritty. It shows the harsh life of those born into the slums of India and although it has the rags to riches element to it, you are also shown the more ugly side of a life of poverty. I thought the film was all the better for this and it made for a film with greater weight and depth. Everyone plays their roles very well and the acting is good from child and adult cast alike and the direction is as good as Boyle is renowned for. There is also an excellent Bollywood dance scene at the end credits which made for a delightful way to end the film. This is much better than I anticipated and the darker feel to some aspects lent it a gravitas that only increases it's appeal. This was highly commended and for good reason. This is one well worth watching.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000002B35|5.0|`Pulse' is an excellent live album from Pink Floyd and offers up some amazing music across two discs. One disc has `The Darkside of the Moon' played in it's entirety and it is incredible to hear the complete piece of music played live. The other disc has a selection of tracks from their career and features many tracks from `The Division Bell' which was the most current album at the time of these concerts. In fact these are the songs I love the most, `Coming Back to Live' is as awe inspiring live as it is on the studio album. `Shine on You Crazy Diamond' is truly epic and makes for the best way to start any album and `Another Brick in the Wall' never fails to delight. The album artwork is great and although the later copies no longer have the pulsing LED light on the spine, this is still wonderfully packaged. If you are a fan of Pink Floyd and love both `The Division Bell' and `The Darkside of the Moon' then this album comes highly recommended indeed, the only problem is that after hearing it you may lament the demise of this giant of a band when you hear the quality of song writing and musicianship on offer.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0061122416|5.0|I can see many negative reviews here, which all seem to come from a literary or a religious stand point.  Those who write negatively about this book are all missing the point. This is a mystical fable which uses metaphors and should not be taken literally.  Paulo Coelho is not prophesying any religious opinions or trying to win any literary awards. He's written a wonderful and inspiring story with a beautiful message about life's journey. Don't take it literally, keep an open mind and you will really enjoy this book. I loved it!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|As the Amazon blurb has stated \\"If Transatlanticism was an inhale, Plans is the exhale\\" and it has to be said that as an individual album it is excellent, but as a companion piece to `Transatlanticism' it is simply flawless. It sounds just similar enough to past albums be enjoyed by existing fans, but it also shows real development whilst retaining the bands original spark. On first listen I loved `Soul Meets Body' and this was only confirmed the more I played this album. I also love the bass playing throughout the album and there are some deft touches and amazing riffs on many tracks; and the most enjoyable for me by far is `Summer Skin' for the bass during the intro. There are the quirky, unique lyrics that made `Transatlanticism' standout in spades and more tight song-writing and accomplished musicianship. As I wrote in my review for `Transatlaticism', after you hear this band you will be wanting to track down more of their music and I have to say I am so glad I did and I am even more impressed than I previously was. If you like great music with an original edge then you will not be disappointed when you give this band a try and if you know some of their previous work, then you know what a treat you will be in for!! Highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|If you catch your head bobbing up and down to even one of his songs on the radio this is a must buy. The songs on the radio, a little over played but still amazing are nothing compared to the other songs on the album. This will be a great addition to any music collection!
B001E45XT4|4.0|The head set is great quality but the microphone seems not to pick up my voice well, other players here me at a low volume while i have it set at a high level.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Even if you find INCEPTION a confusing mind-bender, you can't deny the sheer brilliance of film-making.  Christopher Nolan's superb direction...the awesome visual effects...the superlative editing...the marvelous cast...Hans Zimmer's haunting score...everything perfect!<br />INCEPTION requires complete attention in order to decipher Nolan's complex script but it pays off and makes the viewer mull over its somewhat enigmatic ending.  DiCaprio gives one of his most mature performances and I particularly liked Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page. Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy.<br />Oscar's snub of Nolan is sad as his direction is outstanding.  Recommended.
B004HAG40O|1.0|I encourage artists to experiment with their sound. That being said, some things work, and some things don't. For this album they've decided to eliminate any traces of rock -- except perhaps a few hints of it in a song here or there -- and get rid of any sense of energy they're known for. They've gone for country and folk and even had the gall to include harmonicas which I loathe. \\"Rox in the Box\\" and \\"This is Why We Fight\\" feel like they could be Decemberists songs, but the other eight songs on the album don't and many commit the cardnial sin of being boring.    I was really looking forward to this album as I needed something for the Winter to spice up life; something exciting. Instead the Decemberists have released an album as dead and lifeless as the Winter itself. I can't recommend this to Decemberists fans although I imagine you'll buy it anyway, to give it a chance. I can't recommend this to country or folk fans because I'm not a fan of the genre and thus have no means to really say if it's good for what it is or not.
1594202842|2.0|To promote her book, Ms. Chua, a law professor at Yale, recently wrote a piece in The Wall Street Journal called \\"Why Chinese Mothers are Superior.\\" Now suppose for a second that a white male professor at Yale had written a piece called \\"Why white parents are superior.\\" Cue the diluvian outrage. The protests. The marches. The apologies. The resignations. The shunning. The press conferences in which Yale's president would declare that the author would never again work for the school in any capacity. In other words, the John Rocker treatment.    But what has happened here? Absolutely nothing. Yale and the other Ivy League cesspools excoriate white people for any insinuation--no matter how innocuous or well-founded--that the races differ in any substantial way. Meanwhile, Yale has allowed Ms. Chua to get away with publishing a nazi manifesto in plain sight because she's both female and a minority, which, by Ivy League standards, renders her almost bulletproof.    As to the substance of the book, I have a real problem with Ms. Chua's definition of success. Apparently, she thinks that merely going to Harvard or Yale makes you a success. Here's a bulletin: college is supposed to prepare you for life; it's not an end in itself. And given the statistics showing that socioeconomic demographics have far more to do with admission than does raw intelligence, merely \\"getting into\\" Harvard or Yale is really no monumental achievement. If there is value in going to Harvard or Yale, it lies in the supposedly superior educational experience received there and, by extension, the extent to which that experience will help propel you to great heights in life. And to be perfectly frank, what heights has Ms. Chua reached? Yes, she went to Harvard and Harvard Law School, and she teaches at Yale, but does that resume alone really deserve the \\"overachiever\\" label? Does it justify the harsh parenting she doles out? What has she achieved in REAL LIFE to justify this kind of parenting? She certainly hasn't carved out any noteworthy reputation as a lawyer. So if he hasn't achieved anything in her chosen field, what has she done? Is she working on the AIDS vaccine? Did she cure Polio? Did she help develop the artificial heart? Is she working with poor people in Newark or New Haven? Has she made a lot of money as a successful businesswoman? No. She teaches a bunch of coddled rich kids at Yale, helping pass the silver-spoon baton from one generation to the next while preventing poor people from getting access to the machinery. Big deal.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've always been pretty lucky in that I had good metabolism-until now.  This last year I realized the need to jump start my metabolism as I am getting older and my body has more bulges and extra pounds than it used to.  I came across Jillian Michaels DVDs and all the raves while browsing through Amazon.  This is the first Jillian Michaels DVD I own, and I am amazed as to how intense the workout is for 20 minutes.  I figured that I must be a real loser if I can't find 20 minutes to work out in my day even with taking care of kids and all.  I was so exhausted the first time I tried Level 1.  She works muscles and cardio the same time without any breather, and you can really feel the difference after 20 minutes-just like how I used to feel after working out for 45 minutes at the gym.  I kept it up and have been doing the workouts for a couple months now and my arms, abs and legs have more definition, and I feel a little bit more like my old self.  It was hard to start, but if you stick with it, you will see results pretty quickly.  Jillian knows what she is doing, and she is tough - the exercises burn, but they are effective in a short amount of time.  I highly recommend her DVD.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|i get lucky when i bought this dvd, because i bought it at very reasonable price, only $7.99. And for that price, i get A LOT of special features. and it is ALL GOOD, hilarious. In terms of packaging, this 3-disc collector's edition comes in shiny black and mirror disc, digipack. This is all what i wanted from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. thx, black friday sale :D

B001DXS4E2|5.0|Great classic musical! Film that introduced \\"White Christmas.\\" Filled with vintage Irving Berlin songs, dancing by the superb Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby's beautiful voice. Blackface number might be off-putting to some viewers, but you have to remember that at the time the movie was shot, it was not considered or meant to be offensive.
B001EN71DG|3.0|Like many of you I bought this particular set for the original releases of the films. And it turns out they're presented in a widescreen 4:3 format. Bad description, but basically on my widescreen TV the film occupies a small rectangle somewhere in the middle, surrounded by large black bars. It's being returned. And, I hate to say it, there may or may not be pirated versions of the originals you can download online that are of a much higher quality.
1594202842|1.0|It's kind of scary that this book has so many 5 star reviews. Do you want your children to do well and be the best versions of themselves that they can be? Sure. Do you need to emotionally cripple them in the process? Well, no. In the long run, Chua's methods will crumble. I know this because I endured similar tactics growing up. Like in Chua's case, it was generational. However, it had nothing to do with being Chinese. It's abusive - end of story. I wouldn't even buy this book as a joke because it would support this woman's delusional belief that her ethnicity is the reason behind her cruel parenting.<br /><br />As a survivor of this abuse, I genuinely hope that her children are able to disengage from their mother and realize that what they've been through is not normal under any circumstances. As adults, my siblings and I have suffered from anxiety and, at times, depression. This miserable woman is setting up her kids to be equally miserable. As a parent, you need to put your children first. This woman has and persists in putting herself first. I saw her on Colbert, and I think she's starting to realize her book is backfiring. She's a joke. Battle hymn? Really? A law professor in her 30's against a prepubescent girl? To put it simply, that's beyond messed up. Instead of reading this trash, try Dan Neuharth's \\"If You Had Controlling Parents.\\"
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|The gun right out of the box performs well enough for a safety-oriented plastic dart blaster, but in the end 30 feet is mediocre. It really begins to shine when you open it up and fiddle with its guts, and you can tell they wanted to make it easy. No glue in sight, and all the components are relatively easy to reach. If you remove the air restrictors, plug that annoying hole near he base of the barrel, and replace/add to the main firing spring, your range will increase threefold.    My one complaint is that one of the screw nubs holding the plunger in was too wide for its little cap, and it split when I unscrewed it. A little glue fixed that, though.

B0029LHW68|5.0|The first song I heard off this record was \\"Closer to the Edge\\". I was sort of aware 30 Seconds to Mars existed, but I had never listened to them. Then there was this weird period of time, last summer, where I kept hearing about 30 Seconds to Mars in conversations with people. I didn't want to listen because I knew Jared Leto was in the band, and I didn't like bands with actors in them. Also I'd seen pictures of them with eyeliner, and I \\"didn't like eyeliner bands\\".    A weird series of events had me checking out \\"Closer to the Edge\\" on youtube one day early last September, and I was seriously offended by the pink mohawk (frontman Leto is wearing his hair in a pink mohawk for most of the video). I thought it was \\"trying too hard\\" (If you're a die hard 30STM fan, bear with me, this is a positive review.)    I'd never watched a video I hated so many times, however. And at some point I started to appreciate the editing of the video for \\"Closer to the Edge\\". I think I liked the way the video was edited before I liked the song. And then I liked the song. And then I LOVED the song. (I said this was a conversion, right?) And then I went looking for more 30 Seconds to Mars material, because, well, \\"Closer to the Edge\\" had to be a fluke, right?     But I loved every song I heard. So I bought \\"This is War\\", and holy jesus crickets, what a great record. I'm just going to stop here because I hate to describe music in writing. Let's just say \\"This is War\\" is: Awesome. Awesome songs. Awesome arrangements. Awesome performances. Awesome lyrics.     And then I had to see 30STM live, to find out if \\"This Is War\\" was just a great recording, or if 30 Seconds to Mars were really a great band.     They're REALLY a great band. I've now seen them live three times in as many months, and I could probably see them play every month and not get tired of seeing them live. They give 200% during their live shows. And the fans are - wonderful. Fun people to share a show with, for sure.     Music is subjective; not everyone is going to like everything. But this band is the real deal, so if you've been abstaining (as I was) because of \\"image\\": screw that. Take another listen, and take another look. 30STM is now one of my all time favorite bands.
0765363836|4.0|When the entire world blacks out, millions die in accidents, and the survivors are left to try and make sense of their \\"flashforwards\\".  What caused the blackout?  Can it be repeated?  Should it be repeated?  Is the future fixed or fluid?  These are just some of the questions the that world as a whole has to grapple with.    I watched a couple of episodes of the TV show while it was on the air, but not enough to judge how similar it is to the book.  I enjoyed this book much more then I thought I would.  I expected the story to drag, and was warned that it got overly technical with the physics stuff, but I actually did not find that to be a problem.  I was able to take in what I understood as far as the science goes, and skim over the rest without impeding the pace or flow of the story.
B000002UTO|4.0|This album always got a bad rap when it first came out.  I remember the used CD bins being full of copies of Big Thing.  I bought a copy from one of said bins for $4 or $5 and still have it 'til this day.  I never understood why this album was so maligned.  The catchy hits \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\" and \\"All She Wants Is\\" were fun songs that were played on the dance floor at the time.  \\"Too Late Marlene\\" is another exceptional song on the first half of the album - good vocal.<br /><br />The second half of the album, beginning with \\"Palomino\\" has a more of an experimental, almost progressive feel to it.  \\"Palomino\\", \\"Land\\", \\"The Edge of America\\", \\"Lake Shore Driving\\" - all quality songs.  The two 30 second \\"interludes\\" seem like throwaway tracks; with some thought and careful editing they could have mixed these in so the whole second half of the album flows seamlessly together.  Missed an opportunity there.<br /><br />Overall, I find this to be one of the more interesting and varied albums that Duran Duran has released.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|What would you do if you were tasked with ghost writing a former head of state's memoirs?    In The Ghost Writer, Ewan McGregor plays the writer for former British Prime Minister, Adam Lange (Pierce Brosnan). Ewan is brought in because the former Ghost Writer's body was found washed to shore.    Shorter after beginning the project, Lange is accused of war crimes for kidnapping and torturing suspected terrorists.    The rest of the movie is a thrilling twist-and-turn in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock.    Also starring Olivia Williams as Lange's wife and Kim Cattrall as Lange's PR person.    I gave this movie half of my attention until things really started heating up. This is chock full of A-list actors. You won't be able to miss the not-so subtle hints toward Tony Blair.    This is the kind of movie where most of you will probably figure out the ending beforehand, but it's still fun to think about who-dun-it and why.    Full of misdirection, and betrayal, this is a story of placing a normal guy in the middle of an international political conspiracy.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This music is some of the best music to listen to. It is exciting, thrilling, and above all amazing. I am so glad I found out about this group and I am so glad they finally put an album out. I hope to see more in the future. I highly recommend this to anyone. Buy it!.
B0042MEQVG|1.0|It was better than the first two, but that's like saying a hot poker in the ear is better than a fishhook in the eye.    Eclipse is the third movie of the Twilight saga. (Only one more to go!)    All the characters are back, Bella, Edward and Jacob.    Bella/Kristen Stewart is still as annoying as all get out.    Edward still has the big vampire hair.    Jacob is like Captain Kirk - he finds ways to always be without a shirt.    The best part of this movie, well all three movie so far, is Bella's dad. Billy Burke offers some much-needed comedy in this trash.    So why watch these films if I hate them so much? Simple: I enjoy torture. This is like watching movies like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or something; you end up laughing so hard at the horrible acting and the dreadful writing.    At least, with this movie, you get some good acting by Bryce Dallas Howard. She does a great job at being a vengeful vampire. Although her time is too short. Dakota Fanning, however, doesn't fit her role.    This film is good for frisbee golf and cup holders.

B001PPLIEG|2.0|Such hopes for the new Bond series has been momentarily dashed. Not only will we have to wait extra long for the next movie to come out (due to studio bankruptcy) but Daniel Craig's second attempt at Bond fell flat.    Quantum of Solace never got off the ground for me. I liked how it picked up right after Casino Royale. The opening car chase was perfect for the Bond man.    Then things got confusing and jumbled.    We had characters enter the movie only to be killed in the next scene. What was up with the woman who was supposed to keep her eye on Bond, sleep with him and then get oil poured all over her?    I understand it was in honor of Goldfinger, but things moved too quickly here. There were so many characters that were introduced, without clearly explaining why they were in the movie, only to be killed within 30 seconds.    This attempt to re-energize James Bond as the British counter to Jason Bourne is not having a positive result.    Craig is still amazing as Bond. I think he ranks #2. Yet, even his mad skills couldn't save this movie from the land of the lame.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay, the ending to The Hunger Games trilogy is good reading, plain and simple, and I dont want to spoil this book for anyone so here goes with a sketch of a synopsis and my thoughts:<br /><br />Forced to find a new place to call home, Katniss finds herself the reluctant symbol of a war to bring down the evil President Snow, a man who has been in power of the once bright but long dead United States for far too long. Now known as Panem, a country sectioned off into districts with each one existing for one purpose alone- to supply the over indulged Capital district with whatever it desires- the people of Panem finally have a hope of breaking out of their miserable existence... and it all centers around Katniss and what she'll do next.<br /><br />Winner of the Hunger Games that sparked a civil war, Katniss has become the face of the burning rebellion against the Capital, whether or not she even cares about the war- or knows whom to trust. One things for sure, Snow will be dead by the end of it, and by her hand if Katniss has anything to do with it. This she vows.<br /><br />I marked this as four stars out of 5 here but really it's more than that. Full of action, dark despair and in the end- hope, it really is dystopian fiction in its purist form. And, that is perhaps its downfall for me. The American in me likes my happy endings and, dont get me wrong, there is one, but its certainly not full of rainbows and sunshine. (Not that I always need puppy dogs and rainbows- and certainly wouldnt have believed an ending like that for this series- yet I was hoping for more for Katniss!) But, this is war people, a means to an end, and though I believe Collins was attempting to make the age old point of \\"what is it good for\\" for me it rather did the opposite. Yeah, it isnt good for nothing- but ultimately it may be necessary- especially when evil is ruling. At least in fiction anyway. (It certainly was for this fiction!) So yeah, politics of war? Downfall for the novel.<br /><br />And yet... it's good reading!<br /><br />In the end, I was a tad disappointed in how things played out, but Katniss really is quite \\"male\\" in her thinking and actions and that I thought was the most brilliant part of this series. If she would have been anything less than who she was- or she had been cast as a boy- it wouldnt have worked!n the end, I was a tad disappointed in how things played out, but Katniss really is quite \\"male\\" in her thinking and actions and that I thought was the most brilliant part of this series.

185984054X|2.0|The Missionary Position is a short book of about 100 pages. I so wanted to enjoy Mother Teresa being taken down, but I was left thinking \\"Where is the meat\\"? There were few searching interviews with her nearest and dearest collaborators or her supporters. The most illuminating (excuse the pun) part of the book is in the first pages when we are told of her rise to fame. Malcolm Muggerridge was in India and they took some film of her in room that was not light enough to use a camera. They tried anyway, Muggeridge only half-aware they were using a new kind of film. When the film came out bright in such a dark space Muggeridge spread it wide and far that it was due to some divine light from Mother T, unaware of, (or perhaps having forgotten) the new type of film. From here a legend, and a Saint was born. It seems that Mother T amassed a fortune of $50 million or more from donations - we are told that this money is around but no one knows what it is used for - this needed further investigation. The hypocrisy of her taking money from mass murderers, gangsters and tyrants is exposed, but it somehow lacks bite. It needed interviews with more of the thugs themselves perhaps.<br />I so wanted to enjoy this. I love Hitchen's mind and other books.... but this one did not cut the mustard. I hate even more commenting negatively on a work of a dying man. Chris, if you read this (which I doubt), you have been an inspiration to many of us. Have a good journey wherever you are going.

B00000AFWZ|4.0|This is an incredible boxed set, much better than any other boxed set out there because it's so exhaustingly comprehensiv. This is a collection from a bygone era, in the early 1960's, when every teenage kid said to themselves<br /><br />\\"Those Beatles are so cool!\\"<br />\\" We could do that!\\"<br />\\" Let's form our own band!\\"<br /><br />And hence, here is a collection of garage bands from all regions of the country.<br /><br />You have everything here...from the ultra famous stuff (Louie, Louie, Wooly Bully) to rock gems (Dirty Water, Time Won't Let me), cool covers (Hey Joe, respect), early incarnations of future superstars (Amboy Dukes> Ted Nugent  Golliwogs>CCR) and everything else in between.<br /><br />This collection is so comprehensive and fascinating that you can get lost for weeks sampling all the bands. The accompanying book/liner notes are just as good as the 5 cds. You can truly uncork a bottle/fire up a doobie and get lost in this treasure chest of American music.<br /><br />A casual fan of music will tire of it after the first disc yet, if you are a devoted fan, this is the real deal!
B001KR0BDI|5.0|This book will keep you on the edge of yours seat! It has the perfect recipe for an action novel! Usually my reading is aimed toward older writing, but I was ready for a relaxing read - then couldn't put it down. The writing is rather simplistic, but it gets the point across with enough action, mystery and subtlety to be very enjoyable. It is a perfect coming-of-age story. The main character is confident in her abilities, but naive in the ways of adulthood. Travel with her on her journey!

I could feel eveything that the young heroine was feeling happiness, sadness, hopelessness.

1400032717|4.0|Using a slightly autistic protagonist, makes the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time ingenius, and just more stunning. I'm really amused by the facts Christopher gives us - from his crazy wild numbers to random logic problems, to just facts in general.

It's almost a crazy mystery story about the death of a dog with Christopher growing up along the way.<br /><br />It's the protagonist that makes this novel special, and how he struggles within his own personal handicaps, to grow and solve a mystery. Entertaining, and unique - the Curious Incide of the Dog in the Night-time is not a book to be missed.<br /><br />(On a side note, don't read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time if you're expecting some sort of thrilling psychological mystery, it's nothing like that.

1594202842|5.0|I am from a \\"Chinese mom\\" background, much more lenient though, and there are elements of that upbringing that I am carrying forward with my 2 children.  How far will I go?  I don't know yet.  It really depends on the child.  There is no question that some of Amy Chua's methods were brutal.  I do not condone those.  But I think the message behind it all, that some kids can benefit from some degree of pushing, is a worthy one.  This is not a parenting guide, it's a memoir.  It obviously touched a nerve and a lot of the emotion and vitriol came in response to the most controversial bits that were written about in the initial WSJ article.  Everyone is quick to judge, but, please read the book before you do so.  A lot of it is tongue-in-cheek.  People also forget that she has a sister with Down's syndrome, and she watched firsthand as her mother modified her expectations and goals accordingly.  There is no magical formula here.  We do the best we can as parents, whatever that entails.  What may work for one family may not be the best for another.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult, is a love or hate author. You either love her books or hate her. It's nice to read them once in a while, but not in one sitting - they're far too much alike - court case drama with emotional issues. She is masterful at points, yet too contrived and cliche; too much is coincidence - too much is flowery metaphors.<br /><br />However, on a personal level, I really like Jodi Picoult, and I really like My Sister's Keeper, long before the movie ever came out. It's inspiring, motivational, and painfully heartbreaking. Not just the twist at the end, but the splintering of a family - the soul searching of each member and what it truly means to be alive. I think the story affected me on a personal level, and really made me pause at points - pondering what Picoult was trying to convey. I love the tension she uses, the court drama, the hard moral questions she throws in your faces, subtly yet deftly and powerfully.<br /><br />More on writing style, the way that Picoult likes voicing each character is amazing - her writing is so versatile to be able to change from many characters with different beliefs to voice them so realistically, and so true to self. The only issue with that is, that the characters are too strong, too good, too realistic, and perfected that it seems so contrived, so unlikely and almost annoying. Picoult might try too hard to prove her points, and drive them home with sob stories around her side characters. The background stories of Anna's brother (who's name I forget), Campbell and others push the story to engulf the reader. There is just so much to know, so many human emotions and almost too much to comprehend.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper might try too hard to be the \\"it\\" book, to be the hot controversial seller and the soul crushing pity novel. It's too good to be true, too much and too fast, and almost overwhelming. However, no matter, Picoult knows how to drive home points, how to emphasis human compassion and questions of morality. For that, I believe My Sister's Keeper to be an engaging memorable novel that transcends boundaries. It's just sometimes, it goes too far. And I some others may dislike that.<br /><br />In my opinion, I love My Sister's Keeper, and I think everyone should at least give it a try.ter's Keeper to be an engaging memorable novel that transcends boundaries.

0060920084|5.0|Bill Bryson's book, the Lost Continent, is the quintessential looking for America  book.  After living in England for many years, the author comes home and tries to find  the small town America he remembers from old tv shows.  He mostly fails, but his sardonic  wit and clear point of view makes this a hilarious and enjoyable read.
0765318741|2.0|I Am Legend starts with a solid, if not overused and interesting premise. Nelville is the last man left on earth, or so he suspects, after vampires have taken over. If anything, that in itself adds a reason to read the book. It's really a rather formulaic book, pretty predictable at points but symbolic and poignant at others. And perhaps that's where the strengths end.<br /><br />I Am the Legend is just far too choppy, short and unable to flesh out into something bigger. Much potential, wasted on the second part of the book where the book starts to climax (and of course I won't spoil it). Nelville himself, his past, could have been used better emotionally, truly characterizing him as the sole survivor. Rather, the novel uses his rage has a device to characterize him - lacking the depth needed to sway readers.<br /><br />I am the Legend, is with no regard a bad book, but by the standards of literary masterpieces, it has not a good book. It is a popular, enjoyable, and straight forward easy book to see, maybe, like the brainless shows we seem to enjoy on TV. Far too simple, far too little, far too less is in I Am a Legend to win it the literary strength it needs to succeed.
B001E45XT4|3.0|Sound    Having owned these for several months now, I've begun to notice how poor the sound quality really is.  They are not meant for music AT ALL.  The mids and highs have a very \\"dry\\" and tinny sound.  I've found that though it lacks powerful bass, the bass you do get is very refined.      Comfort    For the first 30mins - hour, they are very comfortable but any use beyond that, they get a bit warm and cause some irritation.  They fit nice and snug which is fine without glasses, but while wearing glasses they press on the frames quite a bit.      Quality    Very nice build quality.  Sturdy and solid.  Should last a while.  Mine have taken a bit of a beating and there's no problems with the cord.  As far as the mic is concerned, my mobo is goofy and distorts any mic I use so I cannot comment on the sound capture.      Tl:Dr, don't get these if you want quality sound.  If you want a cheap, fairly comfortable set of cans for gaming only, they do the job fairly well. I would recommend spending a bit more on a nice pair of cans and a separate standalone microphone.
0143039431|4.0|I read Grapes of Wrath for my AP English class, and it was a struggle to start, but at the end even I was swayed by its mastery.<br /><br />It's very depressing, cruel and harshly realistic about the Dust Bowl and Okalahoman farmers moving to California. California, to look for a new beginning, is their destination. And along the way, it's all about the struggles as humans they go through, their self sacrifices, soul searching and willingness to band together just to get through it alive.<br /><br />If nothing, Grapes of Wrath is moving, and heartbreaking but tedious with description and choke full of lengthy descriptions. I don't recommend this if you absolutely hate historical fiction, as it takes a certain preference of historical fiction to enjoy this novel. I liked it in the end. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for historical fiction, maybe it's because I was forced to read it, but I enjoyed it. I don't think I could've grasped the symbolic Christian references - and I think it would be much more appreciated by a more worldly, older generation than mine.<br /><br />Regardless, try it. It's a classic anyway, there must be a reason for that. Maybe you'll even like it at the end like me.
031603438X|5.0|Being the tender age of 61, the Stones were the guys coming out of the radio when my raging hormones first made their appearance. These guys were great, right from the very beginning, & I would highly recommend revisiting the early albums (England's Newest Hit Makers, The Rolling Stones Now, and 12X5)as you delve into this book.It begins where Keith began, in early childhood. The description of early post war England was quite fascinating to me. The U.S. is really the only country that didn't suffer on the home front from that horrible event . Keith appears to be quite candid in this book, as he recounts singing in the choir & being beat up by bullies in his youth. Not the typical bio of a career hard guy. I especially loved the part of the book that dealt with the seminal days leading up to the formation of the Rolling Stones. Just a group of young guys immersed in a dream that wouldn't be turned away. The drug addiction, death, world travel, & unbeleivable money all came later. All this is covered in due time, with Keith as the fascinating story teller (aided, no doubt, by the ghost writer). My sense is that the real Keith Richards immerges from the pages of this book. The birth of the songs & the recording process were also of immense interest to me, & the book deals in detail with these. I always felt that beneath the gruff exterior there was a man channeling a positive life force (that would be Keith), and this book confirms that impression for me. I understand that this book is available on CD. I wonder if Keith reads it. Can you imagine?!
0374158460|4.0|A fantastic achievement, a true work of literature in an age of tweets and blogs and status updates.    Franzen poses the question \\"How to live?\\" at the very first chapter, and the novel unfolds as the main characters struggle to answer this question for themselves.    Was the question answered? No, it was not. And herein lies the existential quandary of American life, which was built on some semblance or idea of freedom, but does not know quite what to do with it.    It's as if the West had reached the absolute limits of its own ideals, and there is nowhere else to go... but East. Yes, East.    Because the question \\"How to live?\\" HAS been answered, thousands of years ago, by the great spiritual traditions of the East, specifically that of China and India. The dilemmas brought about by economic and social freedom can only be resolved with spiritual insight, the ultimate enlightenment, the true liberation. While Asia now strives to catch up with the progress of the West, now the West seeks to evolve itself by surrendering to the spiritual wisdom of Asia.    Hopefully, Franzen can go beyond the limits of his own American-ness, and make his next work not just the next Great American novel, but the Great WORLD novel. Or maybe somebody else will do it.    That said, I thoroughly enjoyed Franzen's talent and skill in Freedom as much as I did in The Corrections. Bravo to this brave fellow.
0792846443|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as a child and as an adult. As a child it scared me, as an adult I grew to appreciate the story. I am a Kathy bates fan. I enjoy her work. She brought Annie Wilkes to life. The movie is a little more palatable than the book because it's not as offensive and gross. However, the book was a very good read.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Once again, Angelina Jolie does an excellent job of playing the hero in an action flick. Her role is believable, and dynamic. Not many female actresses could pull off a hard-hitting action role like this. I think it requires a certain mind-set. Angelina has nailed the attitude part and makes the role believable.
1400049628|4.0|I'm near the end of this book. Overall I liked it. Not in my Top 5 but a good read if you like Zombies and/or Max Brooks. Some parts are very funny, but most of the book reads like an actual military manual, which is funny when the Zombie element is added. Sort of like if you were watching a cooking show on TV showing you how to cook roadkill but taking it totally seriously, it would still be strange and humorous. Also a lot of this book is standard survival guide stuff, which could actually come in handy if there was a nasty solar storm that caused a long power outage, or a big flood that wiped out a lot of local resources and you had to face starvation and bandits until FEMA finally came through.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I'll start by saying, I am no Kiera Knightly fan so I was reluctant to watch it, but under some insistant urging I gave it a try.  Was I surprised.  I was able to overlook Knightly as the lead character because she was actually good!  Matthew Macfayden's Mr Darcy was a very romantic hero.  His blue eyes are incredibly expressive.  The scene where Elizabeth and Darcy are in the rain arguing and suddenly discover their attraction, is great!....I don't know if I would of had the strength to hold back, Mr Darcy is too delicious.  Anyway, this is an impressive watch!  Let's hear how many dry eyes there are when Mr Darcy finally decides to claim Elizabeth toward the end of the movie...oh my goodness, well done!  So grab a glass of wine, your favorite blanket, maybe a box of tissue, and enjoy the show.  Highly recommend!
0198326769|5.0|Pablo Picasso defined art as the lie that makes the truth evident.  There is little historical substance or even plausibility to this story.  Nevertheless, the truth within this book is powerfully self-evident.  Racism and genocide are a primary component of twentieth century history, from the Turkish massacre of the Armenians, to the Nazi Holocaust to the Serbian death squads.  What makes this book so powerful is the over-simplistic language and the somewhat dull-witted complacency of a young boy little interested in history or public affairs or people in general.    The fact that this story takes place at Auschwitz is not so important, except that Auschwitz is so engrained into the public consciousness as a symbol of genocide.  There is a great deal of irony here, some of which  require suspended belief, such as the identical birth dates of the two boys in question.  But it completes  a picture, that they were born on the same day and died on the same day, hand in hand.  The fence is a symbol of what divides the human race against itself, and the crossing of that fence signifies the desire  to overcome that division, the desire to love one another  in an unjust and cruel world hell-bent on furthering  the division through  the hate of people like the  lieutenant, the passive unquestioning obedience  of social climbing pawns like the kommandant, and the castration of human achievement in the reduction of a fine medical doctor to a hapless potato peeler and waiter.    Love is bursting at the seams throughout all the protagonists in this book, from Schmuel and Bruno, Greta and the grandmother, but is repressed by the evils of an unjust world.    The book is a lie that makes the truth self evident.  Picasso would have been proud.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is Stieg Larrson's first of a trilogy.  It is a pity that he died so young as he was planning to make this a 10-book series (for example, you never find out what happened to Lisabeth's sister...) but we are lucky that the trilogy completed most of the missing ends and finished up a story line.  This book will grab you and does contain some graphic parts in it, but it is definitely worth the read.  In a nutshell, a journalist is framed and sent to a brief jail term with his reputation ruined.  He comes across a brilliant gothic female hacker with a serious problem with making friends who helps his cause.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|How often do you get the chance to listen to Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White, by themselves discuss their inspirations, thoughts on the guitar, and history?  Not very.  Let alone having them all together in the same room, playing each other's music and speaking collaboratively on their music.  The thing that I enjoyed the most from this DVD was how it suddenly made their work more grounded and real.  There is logic, but also choas.  And you start to feel as though you can really understand where they are coming from.  Awesome from beginning to end.  Check it out for sure.
0307949486|5.0|If there are still any readers out there who haven't picked up Stieg Larsson's, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you are missing out. The only benefit to your delay is that you can read all of the books back to back. But do not delay, these books are the most addictive, well rendered and original series to come along in awhile if not ever.<br /><br />Only you wouldn't know that from the first few pages which begin as Mikael Blomkvist, a respected financial journalist loses a libel suit imparting a lot of financial journalism analysis and veered towards dull. But when his potential colleague, Lisbeth Salander enters the arc; the story heats up. Together they attempt to solve a decade old murder mystery, personal problems, and Blomkvist's reputation. It is a lengthy period of story before the two intersect but by then it's hopeless-- you too will be one of the series' millions of international fans.<br /><br />The story incorporates a lot of life detail. You will know what the characters ate, how many cigarettes they smoked and what they were wearing on any given day in the story which adds a lot to the characters and setting. So by the end of the book the characters feel like people you know and the settings like places you've been. The result is magic.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a completely different kind of protagonist and without a doubt the key to the series success. She's a tattooed renegade hacker with a complicated back story and an even more intricate moral code. Her refreshing distinctions guarantee her a spot on the beloved characters of literature list. Her no nonsense proactive spirit forces one to rally around her, and on her shoulders the story is propelled to its conclusion. It's unexpected yet delicious element that this admittedly odd young lady upstages the charismatic and sexy Blomkvist who the story is built around.<br /><br />Like a potato chip, you won't be able to just read Dragon and not subsequent efforts: The Girl Who Played with Fire or The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. And that's a good thing because some of the storylines from Dragon are not satisfactorily resolved in this novel, but are picked up again in both of the series' follow ups.<br />I urge any of you hold outs to grab a copy today.<br /><br />The audio book version I listened to was superbly read by Simon Vance who brings a lot to any reading on his own account. If you haven't listened to a book read by him, he's highly recommended.l Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

B000JQU4TW|5.0|Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.<br /><br />The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful.

B000JMLFLW|3.0|It took my third try to finally get through Pride and Prejudice.  I'll start with the good:  the writing is fantastic.  I can't argue with that...I love the language.  You can pretty much diss someone or compliment someone in so many different ways that I wish our language wasn't so abbreviated.  In a few years we'll all be talking in acronyms at the rate we're going, but anyway, back to the story.  I understand that women during that time really didn't have a place in society except to stay home and make babies...but what I couldn't stand from the book was that it was a bunch of people sitting around just talking or singing around a piano.  It's a love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, but I really couldn't see the love.  It was more infatuation or a little crush so the fact that they \\"SPOILER ALERT\\" got together in the end seemed so forced.  I didn't even like Elizabeth because she had this holier than thou sort of attitude, but I guess that's just her pride and prejudice.  I guess a book about a bunch of women trying to find husbands doesn't interest me.
0801896940|5.0|I am a lifelong student of Physics. I have been a student long beforeI got my PhD in Physics. I am currently a Distinguished Scientist at a Government Lab. This is first review (and possibly the last) I've written for an Amazon book, but I felt compelled to write this after reading this book. It is an excellent example of a 'true' teacher at work who understands how to relate information. This is an art form.     In this book you will learn about Emmy Noether and her work in relating a huge class of conservation laws to nature's symmetries. The book explores how symmetry, invariance and conserved quantities are related, quantitatively. The first half of the book is written for self-study by an undergrad Physics student. It deals predominately with functionals (what are they), functional extremals, and when they are invariant.   These chapters are the prelude to Noether's Theorem and Rund-Trautman's version of the theorem. This work first inquires whether a functional is invariant under a given transformation, and if it is, it uses Noether's theorem to get the associated conservation law. Next, it examines the inverse problem; given the transformation can you seek the Lagrangian whose functionals are invariant. In each section the author works examples in some detail and carries these examples with further detail in each of the following chapters. It's like a novel for physicists.     In the last half of the book, the author teaches you how Noether's theorem is used in quantum field theory. He describes the concept of a field through simple examples and introduces Lagrangian densities. Then Noether's theorem is developed for fields and, in particular, quantum fields. Armed with the machinery from the first half of the book and the knowledge of what fields are, the author addresses the question of given gauge invariance what does Noether's theorem tell us about the properties of the Lagrangian.     Like most first addition books, there a few typos in the book but theyare easy to spot and do not detract from the beautiful presentation of these subjects.    I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.

B003BWQEU4|4.0|So, I was the DUMBO and didn't pay close enough attention. I typed in \\"Dumbo Blu Ray\\" in the Amazon search...found DUMBO in big letters on a blu-ray and proceeded quickly with my purchase.  I assumed that I missed the original DUMBO blu-ray release and that only third party sellers had it left.  This title really should be listed more clearly that it has Spanish packaging.  The \\"Aniversario\\" is the only clue anywhere in the listing that it has Spanish packaging (besides the reviews -- which I didn't read because I knew we wanted it).  I can't find a date for when an English packaged Dumbo will be released, so as long as this will play in English, I will still give it as a gift for my husband. Particularly since we only own Dumbo on VHS, the Spanish on the outside won't be a big deal.  People who don't use English as a first language put up with English plastered everywhere.  Not sure why they'd release only the Spanish labeling, if the discs play automatically in English...are they improving/adding something before they do a regular release????    UPDATE:  The Blu-ray was loose in the case, but plays well...in ENGLISH.  In fact, the disc label itself is in English.  The screen menus don't look as polished as other Disney blu-rays, but the disc seems to play just fine, the picture is of good quality, and thankfully, (did I mention?) it is in English with the options of Spanish, and Portuguese.  Whew!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was pretty unsure about these books because it was not the kind of books I typically read. Once I started this book I really did get into it and the characters. I actually read all 3 books that are in this series in a few days. I am only in my early 20's but I still get very annoyed with some books about teenagers because half the time the characters are so obnoxious I never want to finish the book. This was not the case with this book! I thought this was a fun story that really kept me wanting more. There were parts in the book that I could see coming but for the most part I was surprised and enthralled by these books. I would definitely recommend this series.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Great movie, bought for my Grandmas birthday and I watched it with her and was surprised by how good it was.
B001VLXNLU|3.0|I decided to buy this book because I wanted an easy read and it was a pretty good price. I read the first and second book of this series and could not read anymore because it was just awful. Let me say that I understand this is a young adult book but it was written so terribly I almost couldn't bear to continue reading. Some people have been comparing these books to Twilight but let me tell you it does not compare. I am not even a huge Twilight fan but after reading this it made me appreciate those books so much more. The main character in this series in annoying, whiny and definitely does not seem intelligent. I will say that the second book was slightly better than the first but since I didn't like the first book much that isn't saying a whole lot. I will say the idea of this story is neat and definitely different than a lot of vampire stories out there but I don't think it was executed well. I never stop reading a series once I have started because even if I don't like it much I still want to complete it but I couldn't even bring myself to buy one more of these books.

B0034G4OVS|1.0|This movie is not worth the one star I gave it as it was the most rediculous, movie because of the lack of knowledge the three people on the chair-lift have. They don't even have the sense to pull their clearly pull up around the faces coats.  When the lift is stuck and they are left on over night it goes down hill from there.  These people are SO stupid.  One jumps with legs extended in a straight position and ends up with compound francture in both legs. That's before he get's eaten by wolves.  The two left start bickering and don't for one minute try to think out a practical reason on how to get down.  The second male crosses the cable by hand and because it is so sharp it rips his hands apart.  Finally, he makes it to a lift support and ladder, goes down, then starts down the mountain only to be eaten also by wolves.  The only female is left on the lift quickly getting frostbite only to have the seat rip from the cable and fall with her hanging on.  She slides down the mountain on her stomach passing bloody, completely gross 1/2 eaten corpes and is finally picked up.  This is not a movie to show anyone how to exits in cold conditions, but it sure is one to show them how stupid anyone can be in the circumstances.

I hear all kinds of little phrases of dialogue,that I can't hear in the original versions.I was wondering--and correct me if I'm wrong ,but isn't one of the great things about \\"blu-ray\\", the fact that you can store so much more information on it. Why not include the original prints of the film? I understand the argument ,that in HD,the older films will look that much more...I don't know..dirty? I think the only people that will even click on the option of watching the old versions, will be fans,and they want to relive the way they saw it as kids.I know I enjoy showing my kids the differences in each version. Why not make it simple and just include it all! Let this be THE definitive home release of the films. Much like the recent \\"Remasters\\" were for the Beatles.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book is thrilling and iteresting, sometimes very bothering. LIsbeth Salander seems a little to comfortable in her own skin for someone who has an abusive past and abusive present - but is a very interesting character. Mikael is a little too swave and too much of a ladies man. How can you fall for someone who is very nice and caring but doesn't realy get invilved or risk any emorional attachment. This is even clearer with the non-existant realtionship with his daughter.<br />It's a little greusome but tiltilating and a cliff hanger - although I found the end a bit dissapinting.
0783230079|5.0|It's heartfelt, funny and at the end you want to cry and jump for joy. I saw this as a little girl and as an adult and my opinion hasn't changed. It's one of the best of Robert Downey Jr's work. You wont regret owning this. I promise.
B003K16PAU|3.0|LOVE this book, but the Kindle edition is full of scanning errors. Many French words are simply wrong. Be warned. A friend bought this for me, but frankly any ebook for sale should be copyedited and proofread. It's a crime. I still have to buy the paperback if I ever want to know the real words Orwell actually used.
1594202842|5.0|I admit, I originally got the book because I thought it would give me some tips on how I could raise the bar for my two children.  I thought I was a tough parent until I read some of the excerpts in the Wall Street Journal.  I subsequently found out it was a memoir, not a \\"how to guide\\" but read it anyway and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I laughed out loud many times....Grandpa and the recorder!!!  Dreams for Coco!!!!  I think I gleaned a few nuggets but mostly I just enjoyed the story of super successful, driven people who ocassionally feign poverty (\\"we all had to share a bed to afford some of the trips\\") while describing world travel, and lavish after parties costing in the tens of thousands of dollars.  I found it funny, sometimes inspirational and mostly just awestruck that you could engage in such a single-minded pursuit of something.  My children study piano and I often feel their piano teacher pushes them too hard.  I want them to know how to play piano for fun.  I have no aspirations for them musically.  But I can see that some people have higher aspirations than I do.    If you want to be horrified or offended or defensive then I'm sure you could find things to criticize but if you want to be entertained, impressed, (maybe a little envious!) then I think you should give the book a try.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|In general, I really liked it.  It was definitely a game changer in many ways.  Many of the relationships and facts that we'd come to expect completely changed in this book.   However, I couldn't escape the feeling that this really needed to be 2 or 3 different books.  So many things were going on all at once that I felt that a lot of really good story arcs got less than the attention that they deserved.  Take for instance Spook's storyline which takes a dramatic turn in this book.  It easily could have been a book of its own.  Or, at the very least, a much larger section of this book.      All in all, I was happy with the book, happy with the end of the series.  I just really would have liked more content to really flesh everything out.

B003Q6D27S|4.0|After all the hype I've heard over this chapter, having bought it yesterday, I couldn't wait to see it. For me, this chapter tied up all the loose ends very nicely, there's no need for another after this. Every fan knows Dr. Gordon was going to return, and he does, and it worked for me.  I've liked the whole series, this chapter didn't dissapoint either, except it should've been at least 10-15 min. longer, but oh well. The Bobby Dagen story seemed a little rushed, but there were some good twists. For all you critics who felt this was the weakest, I've seen my share of pointless sequels, this series hasn't had one. However, this chapter was very conclusive, so to continue the series after this, that would seem pointless-all the backstories are finally explained, and the series can finally rest, along with John Kramer. The traps in this one were brilliantly sadistic. To me, this franchise may give hollywood some new ideas for the horror genre.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|SOME SPOILERS<br /><br />Some years back, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez decided to create an homage to the low-budget, high-absurdity midnight cinema, a project they called GRINDHOUSE, after the dirty, popcorn-and-candy-bar-wrapper-strewn, soda-sticky floored, torn screen movie theaters known by that name. Grindhouses usually showed 86 minute double features with names like PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE. They sustained themselves with showings of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and THE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE, ignoring the pungent smells of marijuana and \\"locker room\\" that permeated the seating area, along with cheap wine and beer and vomit---Yes, you can tell, I was there, I admit it. The films grindhouses showed had badly scratched blobby prints that hummed and jumped their sprockets. The third reel sometimes came in the middle, depending on the relative sobriety of the projectionist.<br /><br />Tarantino and Rodriguez's homage included a double feature, PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, and a number of Coming Attractions, among which was MACHETE, a movie simply rip-roaring with silly stereotypes, cartoonish violence, and an absurd plotline.<br /><br />MACHETE's star, Danny Trejo, is an American success story. After completing a now-long ago prison stint, Trejo began acting, at first staring in Andy Sidaris movies. His stone-cold scarred visage has graced many action films since.<br /><br />MACHETE is the story of a former Mexican Federale, nicknamed after his favorite weapon, whose family is killed by a drug kingpin, Mr. Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). Swearing eventual vengeance, Machete manages to escape by swimming the Rio Grande, taking up residence in Texas as an undocumented alien working as a gardener---What else???<br /><br />He is approached by a businessman, Booth (Jeff Fahey), who hires him to kill the ultra-conservative Texas Senator McLaughlin (played like a rabid LBJ by Robert DeNiro), who enjoys hunting down and shooting border crossers in company with Von (Don Johnson), the head of a self-appointed vigilante Border Guard unit (the bad guys in MACHETE are all played by Norteamericanos).<br /><br />Machete takes the upfront money he gets for shooting the Senator, and donates it to \\"The Network\\" a shadowy organization founded by the mysterious She, that aids undocumented aliens and others in need. \\"We help everybody\\" says Luz (the blazingly hot Michelle Rodriguez), who runs The Network from the back of a taco truck, providing money, health care, and lessons in self-defense to the disenfranchised people whom she protects. The idea of class warfare runs like a raging torrent through MACHETE.<br /><br />Although Machete never shoots the Senator, someone else does (in the leg), and Machete is blamed for the assassination attempt (in the wake of Tucson, the whole \\"shoot the Senator\\" subplot has become eerie). Now a hunted man, Machete vows to find out why and by whom he is being framed. He quicky allies himself with Luz, and with FBI Agent Rivera (Jessica Alba). He sleeps with both of them. He also sleeps with Booth's wife and drunken, drug-addled daughter (played by Lindsay Lohan, who was hardly acting) at the same time. Lohan ends the film wearing a nun's habit---talk about over the top!!!.<br /><br />Machete discovers that the whole shooting incident was carefully orchestrated by Booth, McLaughlin, Von and Torrez, who want to reduce the number of illegals in the U.S. in order to drive up drug demand, agricultural prices and service costs, and hence profits, in the companies they own. They can't find Machete, but they kill his brother, a Father played by Cheech Marin, by nastily crucifying him in his own church.<br /><br />Machete goes on a rampage, slashing and chopping his way through the rich mens' minions. The blood flies, often spattering the camera lenses. He escapes capture by cutting open a killer's belly, grabbing a handful of the guy's small intestines, and using it like an escape rope. In his gardener's role, he weed-whacks a few bad guys to death, impales a few more, and basically spreads gore like Christmas cheer.<br /><br />While doing so, he raises an army of Latino farm workers who attack the Booth-McLauglin-Von-Torrez forces in low-riders with blaring radios and bouncy suspensions, fruit trucks, and landscapers' pickups. In the end, the real supporters of American democracy win.<br /><br />It's simply hyperbolic, but, despite its clownishness, MACHETE does say something meaningful to the audience.<br /><br />RECOMMENDEDa few more, and basically spreads gore like Christmas cheer.

B000Q66Q06|4.0|As four of the previous writers have said, this was an outstanding concert.  The playing of the Berlin Phil. is simply breathtaking and the soloists are magnificent.  However, the program is a little short, in my opinion, especially the vocal part where three legendary singers do very little.  I expected a bunch of encores and we got none.  It was very disappointing.

0307474275|4.0|This legendary novel has been touted as some sort of spiritual awakening in literature.  This seems to be at the forefront of the renaissance or resurgence of American contemporary literature.  This book bolsters the American league of so-called religious inspired Christian novels.  However, the novel is an affective hybridization of contemporary elements of suspense, murder, intrigue, religious mystery, conspiracy, and academic prowess.  This book is the quintessential combination between a modern novel and a deep religious and philosophical investigation of the origin of Christianity at its infancy.<br /><br />The conundrum looms ever-present in the quizzical minds of the reader, either established protestant or even liberal extremist Christians.  The unrelenting paradigm of divinity is still the debate between the true and utmost divinity of Christ or a theory that alludes to his fleshly nature forsaking (or at least not emphasizing) the idea of marriage and children.  The question is did Christ ever marry Mary, one of his disciples and have a daughter? Was this titular daughter an heir to a great legacy on earth and did the divinity of her father get passed on to her, thus proliferating the blood of Christ's human lineage on earth.<br /><br />If Christ, Jesus of Nazareth had a wife and child why would this all-important fact be meticulously hidden from the readers of the Bible, if the Bible is not the only account of the life of Jesus why hasn't an ancient scroll been discovered similar to the dead sea scrolls?  Some say that divine intervention allowed for the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls and thus the production of the modern Bible.<br /><br />When the Bible was translated and compiled by the Council of Trent and finally by King James I, a group of learned men used secular knowledge to determine which books would be left out of the Bible. If there is divine intervention and providence then why would God wait thousands of years after the establishment of his Church to tell people that he was married when marriage is summarily one of the most important aspects of human interpersonal relationships and is the primary reason why people of any culture would chose a religion in first place?!<br /><br />Marriage and children is one of the most important aspects of life on earth and the point of religion. It seems paradoxical and futile to give intricate detail about so many different things one should not do to go to heaven...then neglect marriage!  The original Bible would not have left it out and there would have been extremely ancient scrolls speaking of the issue and due to divine intervention God would not have allowed those ancient scrolled to be ignored and left out of the Bible. Thus there is doubt about this entire conspiracy concerning the marriage of Christ to Mary.<br /><br />However, perhaps Christ wanted the Holy Spirit to direct the hearts of men that have truly been saved to determine the issue of marriage instead of telling everyone that they have to get married or they will go to hell.  Christianity offers an alternative life-style that says great men sometimes don't get married and have kids and that's okay, because, the gospel did not want to alienate homosexuals it sought to offer them a way of life that would be considered respectable and noble in society.<br /><br />The expression of the characters personalities and emotional motivations as well as their reactions to the events in the novel were unimpressive and evasive toward the true essence of the novel.  The novel, the word novel is a form of writing that is meant to display contemplative and sentimental ideas about the human spirit, this novel simply unraveled a mysterious conspiracy and neglected to give detail about how the characters felt and why which would have only taken a few words extra at the pivotal moments of the plot. However, action, adventure, mysteries revealed, and existential display of faith is too complex of a theme to add a lotof detail about the characters, the characters psyche and emotions are not as essential and could have distracted from the simple question...does Christ's blood live on in the flesh...is the answer--yes!<br /><br />check out a book about a secret societyyche and emotions are not as essential and could have distracted from the simple question...does Christ's blood live on in the flesh...is the answer--yes!    check out a book about a secret society

0385504225|4.0|Many skeptics and pessimistic voyeurs long to see into the world of the wealthy and powerful autocratic `powers that be'...most critiques think the Lost Symbol is an automatic bestseller due to the adulation and fan fair of the previous books in the series.  This is the long awaited sequel to the legendary Da Vinci Code.  The mystery and mysticism surrounding this books delves into the recesses and hidden cloisters of Washington D.C. where Masonic symbols and hidden knowledge is said to be kept only for a select few erudite aristocratic tyrants.<br /><br />However much truth is ensconced in this labyrinth of symbols and secret societies there is still a distinctive boundary between secular organizations and religious enclaves, one relies on ecclesiastical knowledge and the other relies on ancient wisdom compiled from humanist philosophers and somewhat from popular misconceptions about what the nature of the human soul withholds.<br /><br />Still the proverbial jury is out and there is no definitive consensus on the basic conundrum.  The mystery is his religion more powerful than manmade organizations that control the moral codes, laws, and belief systems of the world.  Are there a handful of billionaire Masons controlling the ebb and flow of the world or is there providence, is God ultimately allowing men to `run things' or does God intervene and control the government and world organization, which would then just be acting as his proxy or authority on earth.<br /><br />About the actual writing style of the novel, I think that it was too simplistic at times, Brown did not go into enough detail about the emotional state, feeling of fear or elation, or the motivations of the characters.  If Brown had taken a bit more time to tell the reader how the character feels about the events that took place in the novel, perhaps the characters would have been more real, more, tangible, and more `fleshed out.' The character seemed like mere representations of power people, rich people, educated people but not real human beings that the reader could emotionally relate to.<br /><br />On the other hand, if Brown had gone into such finite detail many of the readers would have lost focus on the plot and what was actually going on in the turn of events. Sometimes detailed psychological exhibitions of relationships and how characters feel disrupts the flow and resolution of the plot, when most readers just want basic knowledge and the resolution of a mysterious plot with simple suspense and action.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|Look, all the nit-picky \\"film\\" reviewers need to get a grip and enjoy some movies for what they are meant to be. I'm sure the director didn't expect an Oscar for 2012. This movie, and others like it (Twister, Independence Day, etc.) are all about the ride. It's like going to an onscreen amusement park. Who cares about the plot? Does it make you go \\"Whoa!\\"? These movies are all about escaping reality for a little bit, just like a roller coaster making you feel like you're going to fly off into space on that last hairy turn. You know in the back of your mind that you're safe, but what if...? So, when you watch these flicks, you know in the back of your mind that the plot or feasibility are ridiculous. But, woo hoo! what a ride!

B00003CXZ4|5.0|The only bad thing I can say about Memento is that it has put the bar so high that I have been searching for a film of its caliber ever since. Possessed of the sort of evocative plot that guarantees that I will be there on opening day, it thrilled me just reading the synopsis, never mind that rush after leaving the theatre that comes from being completely in thrall. It is beyond doubt, one of the most startling concepts ever put to film. And its not only the plot itself, but the way in which it is told, that makes this a classic. I LOVE when i meet people who have never seen this film, and scratch my head when i meet the occasional person who didn't enjoy it. Inevitably, its the action-movie types who want to be able to run to the concession or make up another batch of chicken wings and come back and still be able to hang onto the plot who wound up disappointed. It demands an absolute attention that many moviegoers will find exhausting, but for me, its why films are made. God, just watching it (which I have, many, many times) still gives me a thrill. Absolute perfection, right up there with Kubrick.

I started these concepts on January 3rd, 2011.  That's right, 15 lbs in less than 4 weeks.  Tim Ferriss presents many different things to the reader.  It is up to you to pick what works for you.  That said, he'll suggest the shortest time, smallest dose, or the quickest way to get there based upon his research and the research/results of others.  The rest is up to you.  This book gets you started on a course called self-experimentation 101. How you proceed is based upon what you want to try next.  Good luck!

B0034G4P7G|5.0|At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy movie about Facebook and only targer with young people. I saw this and man was I wrong. This film was done perfectly. It tells the story Mark Zuckerberg as he created Facebook. We learn he is actually a huge jerk. There were somethings I never knew.    This has to be my favorite movie of 2010. Jesse Eisenberg has gone from cheesy teen flicks to huge star. The special features are awesome.    Special Features:  -2 Commentaries, one by the director and another by the cast  -How did they make a movie on Facebook- A hour and a half behind the scenes  -Angus Wall, Kirk Baxter and Ren Klyce on Post  -Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and David Fincher on the Score  -In the Hall of the Mountain King: Reznor's First Draft  Swarmatron  -Jeff Cronenweth and David Fincher on the Visuals  -Ruby Skye VIP Room: Multi-Angle Scene Breakdown    BUY!!

0385341679|1.0|I have spent years reading the Highlander series and then the Fever series.  I got my mom and best friend hooked on the books as well.  We waited a whole year for this book to come out and spent the entire weekend eagerly reading.  However it was such a disappointment once we finished it!  It felt like the author was trying to pull an overnighter to finish a final thesis.  The author seemed like she was continually pushed to meet a deadline and was trying to serve her editor rather than serve her characters the way she should have.  The book was very flat and mediocre after such a great journey with the other books she has written.  I either thought she needed more time to finish it without rushing, or perhaps needed to write another book rather than jamming everything into this book.  This book seemed scattered, and jumped all over the place.  Shadow Fever did not have the flow of the other books in the series.   Also why bother trying to cram and a tie up a bunch of lose ends from the  series into one book when she left lose ends anyway?  She could have cut back on this book and continued with another book and still she would have had a fabulous book with another unexpected surprise to come for her readers.  After such a disappointment I would not recommend even starting the books.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|When I heard this would be the last film in the series. I was very very skeptical. Many classic horror movies have had a \\"final movie\\" and then have many more after it. I thought this would end but with a maybe. But it didnt, it ended all the loose ends.     The gore didnt disapoint. The real stars were the death traps. They didnt hold back on making us cringe.     Now the plot was ehh at best. The 3D wasnt impressive...well I saw it in 2D but I could tell 3d wasnt good. Now Scream Queens 2 winner's role she won...was only for less then a minute. At least season 1 winner was in the opener and another scene in the last movie and makes an appearance in this. Another big issue was the main trap story:     A man who made a fortune lying goes through the latest game, trying to save his girlfriend and others in different kinds of traps.    Dont get me wrong, its good...except its been done in 3 of the other 6 movies. They could've came up with something more original.    In the end, this is a solid rent.    Pros:  -The Gore  -The traps  -Great way to end the series...or is it?    Cons:  -Plot was mediocre   -3D wasnt good  -They made a girl go through a whole reality show to earn only less a minute of screen time.  -The main trap story has been done 50% of the other movies.

1594202842|5.0|I'm a student of Professor Chua's, and know her for her honesty, encouragement, warmth, and incredible friendliness. I was a bit skeptical about this book, but reading it completely changed my mind. CThis book is a memoir, not a parenting manual, that covers yes, controversial topics, but that also treats those topics (and the author) with humor, honesty, and incredible courage. The story that is being told is one both of an individual family and its mother, but it's also a story more broadly about immigrant families and the mentality that *often* (not always) comes with that. The unapologetic belief in your children, the sacrifice parents have to make to instill a sense of discipline and achievement, the knowledge of a world that can be very very harsh that then informs the wish for one's children to be as invulnerable to that as possible, are all ideas that resonate deeply with many families, immigrant or Asian-American or Asian or otherwise. My point is that those values are what really seem to be driving the \\"philosophy\\" behind this book, not some idea of raw superiority. There was also a good Time article that perhaps points to some underlying issues behind the controversy: [...]    Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is powerful, honest, poignant, funny, unassuming, and deserves to be approached as such. Moreover, there is a lot to be said for context! Preemptively dismissing it based on what has been on the news and so forth is too easy - and too judgmental - it not only shortchanges the book, but it shortchanges and diminishes the public discussion around the book. But most of all, it really shortchanges and reflects a bit poorly on those engaging in that discussion.
0316067938|2.0|There are some books that the reader cannot put down, reading as fast as possible to find out how the story ends,  there are books that the reader will slow down in the final pages in order to savor the ending as long as possible and then there is this book, that had this reader reading as fast as possible far into the night so it would finally be over.    The series began with TWILIGHT, which had a great deal of promise.  The premise was that 16 year old Bella Swan was sacrificing herself by leaving her mother, Renee in sunny Arizona to enjoy her life with her new husband unencumbered by Bella, and moving in with her father, Charlie, in the small town of Forks, Washington on the rainy Olympic Peninsula.  While dealing with the trauma of being the new girl in the tiny high school Bella meets and falls in love with the mysterious, gorgeous and wealthy Edward Cullen.  Edward is the perfect teenage boyfriend, besides the previously mentioned attributes he is also smart, charming, attentive and oh yeah, a vampire.  Of course he is a 'good' vampire, one who eschews the more usual vampire fare of human blood in favor of animal blood, (free range animals, so the neighborhood pets are safe).  Unfortunately the rest of the series does not live up to the promise of the first novel.  Bella becomes less mature and independent with each page.  When we first meet her she has supposedly taken care of her mother 'ever since she can remember', picking up the messes Renee left behind.  By the second novel Bella went into a deep depression after breaking up with Edward, and was willing to accept the restrictions he placed on her after his return.  When finally the saga concludes in BREAKING DAWN Bella finally gets her way, she is with Edward but manages to keep her friendship with Jacob, and her relationship with her parents.    This series has become wildly popular with both the 'young adult' market and among older - primarily female - readers as well.  It is doubtful that it was ever intended to  be anything other than enjoyable escapism, a compelling, entertaining story that would attract teen readers, perhaps making reading a socially acceptable activity, at least for a short time.  The series did do that, likely far beyond the wildest dreams of the author or her publisher.  It is unfortunate though that so many questionable messages were thereby broadcast to such a wide audience.  The female characters are never fully realized, each could be summed up in a phrase or two, Renee - spacey child/woman; Esme - caring mother; Alice - fashionista etc. The men,  at least the younger ones grow and mature but not the older men or the women.  By the final pages all the characters are neatly paired off, apparently it is not possible to live without a mate.  Unfortunately a couple of those pairings are between near adult males and very little girls, girls who apparently will never have an opportunity to choose for themselves.       The series began with a great deal of promise, it could have told a much better story if Bella had been allowed to mature into a fully realized character, one who could make a decision independently.  As it is the story drags on, is stretched paper thin to twice the length needed.  It is reminiscent of high school, where absolutely every action has to be discussed, debated and talked to death.  It is too bad that Meyer did not have a clear vision of where she was going with this entire series and then stick with it.  It could have been so much better.

Although overwhelmed with toys and more toys, the boys were very happy with this gift and enjoyed identifying figures they had in their Lego sets, and locating the right place to put the stickers in the book.  Definitely a hit.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is, of course, all in French, though with the subtitles, everything was clear.  This is a beautiful, deep, lighthearted, romantic but not cheesy or soppy movie.  Just Watch It!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I simply love this album. The voice, music, production all come together to reward the listner with a wonderful musical experience.  The Josh Bell cut is my favorite.  Buy, listen and enjoy. Simple and beautiful, simply  beautiful.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Avatar is a great movie and the extended scenes are great. Two of the discs appear to be almost identical except for a few different scenes on them... Still, well worth the price.
0452289963|5.0|The Chapter titled \\"Painbody\\" was the most enlightening to me, and I feel sure that everyone can identify, if not completely relate to it.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Season Five of the reconstituted/reimaged Doctor Who was greatly anticipated, not just because of the transition from David Tennant to Matt Smith as The Doctor, but what direction Steven Moffat would take as the showrunner after--using the terminology I've used with this series--the Russell T. Davies chapter.  Smith--the youngest actor ever to play the TimeLord--brought an old-soul nature to the role.  If Tennant seemed to hearken to Tom Baker, Smith seemed to go all the way back to Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell; a little crotchety at times, but filled with the usual boundless energy and the lines flying at warp speed.       The Companion to Smith's Eleventh Doctor is Karen Gillan's Amy Pond.  The immediate issue with Gillan--because of her red hair--is to immediately compare her to Catherine Tate.  Whereas Donna Noble was all mouth and \\"shoulders\\" (AHEM); Amy Pond is all eyes (brown and doe-eyed) and legs.  Not that she isn't mouthy, but Amy has NOTHING on Donna.  In this storyline, The Doctor first meets \\"Pond\\" (As he calls her sometimes) when she's seven, leaves for two minutes (his two minutes), but comes back to her 12 years later (Her 12 years), then, when she's ready to travel with him it's after a minute of his time--but two more years (And the night before she's supposed to get married) in her time (There WILL be a test on this later...).  Plus, there is the element of Amy's attraction to The Doctor, something that plays out at the end of the \\"The Time Of Angels/Flesh And Stone\\" two-parter.  This isn't a case of Amy having the feelings for The TimeLord that Rose Tyler or Martha Jones had...this is a Companion in heat.  Which leads to the first interesting twist in the Moffatt chapter...       The first unique twist of this first part of the Moffatt chapter comes from Arthur Davrill's Rory Williams--Amy's fiancée, who ends up being a key part of this season; putting Rory into the TARDIS--which sort of gives the storyline a feel of Jack Harkness/Gwen Cooper/Rhys Williams from Torchwood.  Moffatt takes a very different tack here by very quickly giving this Doctor his family...it's just a little bit of a shock that the fourth member of this group is Alex Kingston's River Song--but make no mistake, it's a pleasant shock.  River was introduced in Series 4--the two-parter \\"Silence in The Library/Forest of The Dead\\"--as a woman who at some point, ends up being very important to The Doctor, but he currently keeps running into her out of order.  Kingston certainly brings a little bawdiness to the character--letting The Doctor know that he's about to run into her with the message, \\"Hello, Sweetie\\"--but the season finale--\\"The Big Bang\\"--also alerts the viewer that there's more to her than just being a Companion (Future wife?) to The Doctor.  Suffice it to say that (For those familiar with the Whoniverse) hearing a Dalek begging for mercy from a Companion...is a little different.  This series--with River's appearances in four episodes--allows for River to become the person pointing towards the impending dangers that The Doctor, Amy and Rory face, but she also shows her affection for her man.  The last scene between Kingston and Smith in \\"The Big Bang\\" is a hearty and passionate moment where River really starts letting her guard down to The Doctor...and gets cut short with her next warning of impending danger.       There are many high points in this season--the opener, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", in which Smith establishes his take on The Doctor, and the season's storyline gets set into motion...\\"The Beast Below\\" has the surprising and unique twist of Amy picking up on things early and stopping The Doctor from making a mistake--plus a great turn from Sophie Okonedo as \\"Liz Ten\\"...the aforementioned \\"The Time Of Angels/Flesh And Stone\\", which brings back The Weeping Angels from Season 3's \\"Blink\\";  \\"The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood\\" two-parter which begins the time paradox that is part of the season's climax;... but my absolute favorite story of this season is the episode \\"Vincent And The Doctor\\", where the TimeLord and Amy meet up with Vincent Van Gogh after seeing something out of place in one of his paintings at Musee D' Orsay in Paris.  It's a great turn by Tony Curran as the tortured artist...who develops a little bit of a thing for Amy...but what makes this episode is an uncredited performance by Bill Nighy as a curator/expert at D'Orsay who unknowingly lets an unpopular artist during his life know that he ends up being held in higher esteem in history.  It's a touching and brilliant scene, all at once heartbreaking and uplifting.  Nighy is just great, oblivious to the person near him; Curran is heartbreaking--finding out that his art is held in such high esteem after his departure.       Overall, this first part of Moffatt's chapter allows Smith to establish is old soul in a young body (\\"Bow ties are cool...\\"), Amy to evoke some element of Donna Noble (Though Donna made the point that she wasn't a shag in the TARDIS early on to The Tenth Doctor) while being the ultimate hero of the season, Davrill to become something more than Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith from the Davies chapter, and Kingston to begin to add layers--both heroic and ominous--to River.  All in all, a good beginning to the Moffatt Chapter.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|This may well be seen as director David Fincher's best ever film, deserving of all plaudits bestowed by critics and audiences alike. An improbable idea for a movie, the \\"The Social Network\\" is unexpectedly involving from the opening scene when we're introduced to Facebook originator Mark Zuckerberg as a Harvard undergraduate sitting across the table from his girlfriend (who is about to dump him for \\"being an a**hole\\") in a night club. We're shown up-front what kind of character he is: nerdy, a little socially challenged, no effective censoring filter from brain to mouth, definitely not your average movie-hero type but at the same time immensely intelligent, creative and uninhibited by conventional thinking. Young Jesse Eisenberg puts in an oscar-worthy performance as a not-exactly-endearing Zuckerberg (the real life Mark Zuckerberg has apparently seen the film and claims that a lot of the details are wrong). Though we don't know how close Eisenberg's mixed-bag portrayal is to the real Mark Zuckerberg, Eisenberg does a masterful job sustaining a difficult character role and slowly revealing more nuanced and complex traits as the film progresses.<br /><br />The storyline unfolds by juxtaposing two latter-day lawsuit hearings where Zuckerberg was sued simultaneously by Facebook co-founder and Harvard student friend Eduardo Saverin (played again to perfection by young Andrew Garfield) for being deceitfully cut out of the business by Zuckerberg when he moved to California, and by the rich high-society Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer in a triumph of seamless CGI technology) who claimed to have seeded the original social networking website concept to Zuckerberg who then allegedly took their basic idea, wrote the program code and made it a successful venture. These round-table legal hearings alternate with the main action, shown in flashback.<br /><br />The script is razor-sharp and makes for delicious black comedy as the audience eventually ends up rooting for the socially inept and unlikeable Zuckerberg as he navigates his way through the maze of greed and self-interest ranged against him whilst working day and night to perfect his programming for the Facebook site. The pacing is fast and the editing snappy: the viewer needs his wits about him to follow every twist and turn. Justin Timberlake puts in a stellar performance as cynical, iconoclastic but visionary Napster founder Sean Parker who enticed Zuckerman to relocate to California, and had the vision to see that the Facebook concept could be a one-off opportunity to make billions of dollars for the founders if it was handled right and not sold off too soon; that accepting advertising would make the site \\"uncool\\" and, though it might bring in needed short-term revenue, it would at the same time inhibit growth and downgrade its ultimate floatation value.<br /><br />The script is full of biting one-liners and dense, intelligent dialogue. Virtually every minute of the running time is, unexpectedly, edge-of-seat drama. Alan Sorkin's screenwriting is sharp, economical, witty and with never a wasted line; the comedy the deepest imaginable shade of black.<br /><br />Anyone who knows the story knows that Zuckerberg was persuaded to settle out-of-court and everyone ended up rich, even the undeserving. Everyone is a winner, but only financially and not morally and we don't have a conventional \\"happy ending\\". The film's cynical heart is another great strength: it's a bitingly realistic social commentary on contemporary values, on a global economic system which disproportionately rewards the originator of one creative idea whose time has come, so long as said originator is smart enough and ruthless enough to time it right and carry it off. Zuckerberg became the world's youngest multi-billionaire by age 25. Echoing the opening nightclub scene with the disenchanted girlfriend, the lawyer's final throwaway line on advising Zuckerberg to settle out of court \\"You're not an a**hole Mark, but you're trying hard to be one\\" could be the definitive quote summing up not just the characters in the movie, but the current zeitgeist in an inequitable and money-obsessive world. The understated musical score is perfect for the mood.<br /><br />If you haven't yet seen \\"The Social Network\\", put it at the top of your movies-to-see list. If you're smart, educated and socially aware, and just a little cynical about our contemporary society you're probably gonna love it.to be one\\" could be the definitive quote summing up not just the characters in the movie, but the current zeitgeist in an inequitable and money-obsessive world.

0765326353|5.0|I've read hundreds of reviews and probably a few hundred fantasy books. This is my first written review. I am so happy, anxious and excited to have a new series to look forward to as I did with the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. Thanks to Brandon Sanderson that series will be completed.   I have had to force myself to put down The Way of Kings so I could savor the story longer. As said in other reviews here it is an easy read. I tend to read a little then go back a line or two to be sure I got the message. That helps me even though sometimes it confuses as well. LOL   I am probably going to reread this in time for the next so it is definitely going in my library, along with the George R Martin, Game of Thrones, unfinished series and books by Margaret Weis/Tracy Hickman.   The four main characters and lots of sub characters  live in this world of stone, grass that slinks away in holes, shell creatures from snail-sized to giant \\"chasmfeinds\\" that smashes and eats everyone.   Szeth, The Truthless, an assassin, who has no choice but to kill, then there's young Kaladin the would be surgeon/soldier turned slave who finds himself unable to cope with failure when everyone around him dies that he tries to protect. Shallan is a young girl with a family secret that interferes with her ambitions of knowledge and happiness. Dalinar, one of nine Highprinces, is an aging soldier who wears Shardplate armor that will protect the wearer at the same time give him added strength to wield his powerful Shardblade to slaughter his enemies.    The enemies are called Parshendi, a red and black colored people who are accused of the murder of King Gavilar, Dalinar's brother, it was the act that started the war of Vengeance.  The magic of the land is performed by the use of gems, they are for light, for money, some people can walk on walls or bind a person to the ceiling. Soulcasting is done by a Soulcaster using certain gems to turn stone to smoke or create food for the people who live in the land of stone. The Soulcasters are prized in most lands but there are some who see them as evil.  There are maps(I love maps) and drawings of the plants and animals it helps in the imaging part of reading for me.  There! I hope I've  said enough to help in your choice as whether you ought to buy this or not. I am sure glad I did and if you enjoy a fantasy series that keeps you waiting for the next one you'll love this one. I think Sanderson is one of the best authors to share his storytelling with the world of story readers.
B000KIPT30|4.0|I used this to deal with a new PC that had an audio card that only barely could drive my headphones (Audio-technica M50).    This amp didn't have enough gain to do the job - so I can attest that the amp doesn't go into distortion conniptions even at maximum gain.    But when driven by something that could put out more normal audio levels the amp works like a charm.    So I clubbed the offending sound-card into submission (by replacing it) and am now quite happy.    The amp box could use a couple of rubber feet to keep it from sliding around on my desk.
B00005QTAR|5.0|The DVD came in good shape and wasn't scratched or anything. For someone who doesn't feel like buying every Star Trek episode these are a great way to go
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is another hit from HBO, it is more about the lives of individuals throughout the war in the Pacific rather than a platoon of soldiers in Band of Brothers. It gives you a since of the mental and physical struggles faced in that theater of war, which varied drastically to that of Europe. Overall I think it is great for entertainment value with little historical value.
B002ZG980U|1.0|Although a thought provoking concept the movie just didn't quite help the viewer take the concept further along.  Disjointed, annoying and even the acting could not help this movie convey the concept.  Not worth your time or brain cells.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|THE 2ND DISC DID STOP TWO TIMES AND HAD TO BE-SET OTHERWISE LOVE IT   SEMPER FI
B002ZG980U|4.0|An excellent movie.  One that needs more than one viewing to understand and delve into things missed in prior viewings.  It is a movie that keeps you thinking and imaging dreams.  It is in the vein of Matrix but much less dark.  A movie that I am definitely glad I saw and purchased.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I have a mediocre home theater system hooked up to my xbox.    I bought this as we have multiple TVs in one room, one for Dad, one for the kids. So, headphones for the single user, and let the kids have normal sound.    And WOW.    Okay, something is wrong with my theater system. (which isnt news to me, but wow, didnt know it was missing that much).    These headphones are incredible. I am really amazed at how different Center Channel sound is than sound that comes from all directions/surround sound.  These headphones are great for me.    My first \\"real pair\\". And while some may say they are toy headphones, not audiophle headpones, etc. I am quite impressed.     One thing I didn't realize, is that for the Mic to work it needs to be plugged into the controller. I find that annoying.    Also Another Negative, I like my microphone on the right side of my head. I find it distracting to have it on the left. You cant switch sides. I hope I get used to that, I would hate to return this over that.     Build quality seems, pretty darn cheap actually. I think its fairly chintzy plastic. That however probably makes them as lightweight as they are. They are light. So light they feel like they are going to fall off. I do wood working and wear substantial sound deading headphones when in the shop, and am quite accustomed to things on my head over my ears. These are not uncomfortable, how could they be, the are almost as light as a balloon. The ear  material is very soft and comfortable. They are round ear muffs, and barely envelope my massive ears. (Note I am a 6' and have what people general consider large ears).     Overall, happy. Sound is great to me. Build quality is meh. Weight is ultra light to me.
030746363X|5.0|As a fan of Tim Ferriss' first book, \\"The 4-Hour Workweek\\" I was very much looking forward to his latest book.  I'm also a fitness trainer myself and thought I already had a pretty good understanding of what it takes to maximize your body.  I'll have to say right off the bat there's nobody out there who's going to successfully implement every little strategy that Tim discusses in his book.  But the best part I've found about it is you're able to pick out the subjects that are most interesting to you be it weight loss, muscle building, better sex, holding your breath, etc.  I wouldn't go so far to say that Tim is an expert in everything related to the body but he's much more of a successful dabbler who's smart enough to surround himself with brilliant people and learn from them.      I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Nutrition but I've had blood sugar problems for years.  Even though my body fat percentage is under 10% I've still had really bad blood sugar issues early in the morning.  After reading \\"The Glucose Switch\\" chapter and implementing some of Tim's simple strategies my blood sugar has improved dramatically.  I'm not waking up wanting to kill somebody and I'm not about to pass out when I go to work in the morning.  There's a ton of information in this book and in all honesty I'm probably not even going to try most of it, but it's a fascinating read and the information inside really does work...it just depends on what you're looking for.
0316044695|5.0|This is a well written account of a remarkable tale of survival of one of our  nation's most elite war fighters. The training sections may seem unnecessary or over blown until you realize what a Navy Seal goes though, and how that made his survival possible. This story of some our nation's true hero's and their comrade who survived to tell their tale is a must read.
1878424505|1.0|I'm just going to quote a paragraph from the book, here, and let you decide for yourself.<br /><br />\\"Every human is a magician, and we can either put a spell on someone with our word or we can release someone from a spell. We cast spells all the time with our opinions. An example: I see a friend and give him an opinion that just popped into my mind. mind. I say, Hmmm! I see that kind of color in your face in people who are going to get cancer. If he listens to the word, and if he agrees, he will have cancer in less than one year. That is the power of the word.\\"<br /><br />(8th paragraph, Chapter 2)
B00000DRE1|2.0|I'm a long time fan of WASP & in fact THIS is the only studio album I don't like, it just seem to take itself too seriously (if that makes sense). It's just my opinion but maybe there was too much thought put into this album.
044654759X|1.0|Did anyone else see the similarities between this book and Black and Blue & the movie, Sleeping with the Enemy?? I was greatly disappointed in lack of originality. I had heard that from Sparks there are twists and turns, but the \\"theme\\" with Jo was overshadowed by the grotesque character of Kevin.    I kept reading just see if I would be surprised and no, I wasn't...this will be my last.
B00000JKUD|4.0|Sure this was recorded several decades ago.  Yes, the equipment today is much different.  However, the subtle ajustments that Earl would make to achieve a different roll or to delay the hook a few more feet can still work today.  And besides, you're getting a personal lesson from the Doomsday Stroking Machine, and that's pretty cool!
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Where do I start? This movie stirs up so many emotions in you that I can't even decide where to start. I'm a huge fan of the movie Let The Right One In and went into seeing this with a not so open mind, BIG MISTAKE! I was blown away.<br /><br />Let Me In is as good as the reviewers say. How could it not be though, right?!<br /><br />Let Me In is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) who puts his spin on this classic vampire tale. He shows the utmost care and respect to the original source material while still being able to give us something that's totally new, Now that's talent. I eagerly await his upcoming projects as he is a director I have come to trust when it comes to giving 100% of his being into one of his movies. He gave us a masterpiece in the form of Let Me In and for that I will always be grateful.<br /><br />If you had a cast that included just Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas you would have an excellent film. But that's not all Let Me In had. This movie was blessed to have two of the greatest young actors we have seen in sometime in Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road). The two are magical on screen together and they absolutely steal the show. To be so talented at such a young age is amazing to me. They prove without a shadow of a doubt that they will be forces in the movie business for a long time. I would say that we are truly lucky to live in a time where we can see them grow as actors. They are that good!<br /><br />As I said earlier, this movie moved me like no other. It's very hard to explain what single emotion you feel afterward because you feel so many different things. Normally you would watch a movie and forget it within a day or two but not Let Me In. It sticks with you for some time; it's almost haunting in a way. You'll dream about it and think about it for weeks, well months in my case.<br /><br />I know I didn't go into much detail about what the movie is about, but most of you know already. This review is just to let you \\"Be Me A Little\\" and let you know how moved I was and continue to be over this movie. It is my hope that you'll take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and experience this film. Don't just watch it, live it and breath is as well. If you feel the way I did after seeing it, and I am pretty sure you will, then you know what you have just witnessed is something special. It is not often that a movie comes along that can make you feel this way. So enjoy it and cherish it because it's a gift that is once in a lifetime. I was \\"Let In\\" and I am so glad that I was. Enjoy!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I couldn't tear myself away from the TV. I loved it. A great cast and fantastic dialogue. It should be a must see for everyone.
B004DK49DW|4.0|If a radio station doesn't have (Still alive ) On there playlist shame on them. that song will put Social D. toward a mainstream audience.  To us hardcore fan's maybe a little bitter.  Can't say they don't deserve it. This cd  and vinyl has some great songs.
0345505387|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the other books in the Outlander Series, but this graphic novel jarred me back to reality a couple times. It's written from Murtaugh's point of view instead of Claire's, which gives some interesting details not available in the other books. But, some of the visual details don't match the books. For instance, this book shows Claire's dress as she steps through the portal as dark blue, where the book Outlander says it has large flowers on it. Also, one of the pictures shows Jamie without a shirt from the back without showing his scars, and the book says he always wore a shirt because he was sensitive about those scars. I would be willing to read other graphic novels in the Outlander series, but they need to better match the books where the details are mentioned (or shown) in both.
B002VWONB2|5.0|I know this is simply adding to the list of 5* reviews but I just have to say this is what BD is for. The quality is pristine and on a decent home system you really get the cinema feel. The tone and detail is excellent and a perfect recreation of the film. A must have film in every way and well worth buying on BD.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|I didn't really hear much about this movie when it first came out, and having seen/owned every Saw movie so far, I was very excited to check this out. In my opinion, the movies only got more exciting as they went on. I think the 3rd, 5th, and 6th movies really were the best of the series. And I had high hopes that this one would top my list. I headed over to the closest movie theater that was showing this film, about a half hour away, to watch the supposed final Saw installment. The beginning really kind of dragged on for what seemed like a half hour but was probably only ten minutes, and I feel that the majority of the 3D action went on in the first scene, so I was disappointed not to find much of it later on in the movie. When the story finally got movie, it was on-the-edge-of-your-seat good. The traps are all new, but they have that same old touch to them. The characters are decent, though I was happy to see the survivor of the first Saw movie as I think he is a very good actor. The whole plot was a new and interesting concept, I will admit. The end sort of surprised me, but left me hungry for more. I felt like there was not a proper ending to the series and still had some questions lingering in my mind. I guess that's just part of the suspense, though. The reason I give this three stars is just that. The ending. I think it ended sort of quick, and seemed as though the screen writers either ran out of ideas, didn't have the budget to film another scene, were on a tight deadline, or a combination of the three. I have been hearing fleeting rumors of an eighth, 2D movie, and I feel that if there was, and it was successful, it would give the series a solid ending that it rightfully deserves.
0061020680|4.0|This book came highly recommended and lived up to the hype.  I thought it was funny, while maintaining an interesting story.  I'm planning on reading more in the Disc World series, so we'll see how it goes.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This thing is pretty versatile, and quite a bit cheaper than anything else out there, but don't think it's subpar because of the price.  The build is nice, and can probably hold up to some pretty good wear and tear (I can't speak to the weatherproofing).  The internal compartments are roomy, and the entire padded area is configurable, so you can detach the inserts (they're velcro) and move them around to fit your equipment.  There's plenty of padding for your fragile items, and everything is held securely when the bag is closed.
0385341679|5.0|The wait for book #5 was tough but very worthwhile. Excellent job, Karen! Many burning questions are answered but not everything. I attended the book launch in New Orleans and Karen said she felt it was necessary to leave some questions open. I agree. The story keeps you guessing until the very end. Just when you think you have it all figured out you get slammed with another revelation. I usually never reread books (at least until I forget them) but this one I read over and over - I needed it to fully understand all that had transpired. Geez, I feel as satisfied as Barrons and Mac after, well you know...    Good News: Karen has a three book follow-up planned which will focus on Dani. she says we have not seen the last of Mac, Barrons, Christian or the other Keltars!

0786956127|5.0|I was not a huge 4th Edition D&D game fan when it came out.  That confession done, Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro have won me over with their fantastic gaming props.<br /><br />The entire set of essential tiles are fantastic!<br /><br />The quality is top-notch.

0786955716|4.0|I've revised my review a bit.<br /><br />I see that most of the reviewers *hated* this product.  I feel that it is useful when used with other tile sets.<br /><br />Are you going to be able to construct an entire city with this tile set?  Are Sea Monkeys as cool as the comic book ad would lead you to believe?  Alas, the answer to both these questions is no.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you need to put together a couple of indoor settings in short order then this set can save a DM hours in drawing or designing.<br /><br />The line of \\"essential tiles\\" is helpful for any campaign setting.<br /><br />The quality is top-notch.

I agree.  I use Campaign Cartographer for my specialized rooms and encounters and then print them out on cardstock.  While that produces high quality props that are tailored to my campaign, it is much more expensive and time consuming.  So yes, I agree that the tile set cannot match every single conceivable situation, but it would have been a wonderful addition to my DM arsenal 35 years ago and for the starting DM today.  And, honestly, it is useful today for the generic and ad hoc encounters.<br /><br />In service,<br /><br />Rich<br />The Original Dr. Games Site since 1993
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing this workout for only two weeks now and wow, I can't believe how much definition I already have in my stomach area. I can't wait to see how I look in another two weeks! For only 20 minutes a day there's no excuse for anyone not to be able to do this workout every day. It's high intensity but that's how you're able to do it for such a short period of time and have results. I feel so incredible every time I have finished this workout. If you're looking for a workout to provide big results in a short amount of time this is it, but you've got to work hard in your 20 minute routine.
142311339X|5.0|This book had be hooked from the very beginning, it was shrouded in mystery and you got the plot in small pieces in every chapter until finally you understood the whole thing. Rick just does such a great job describing his characters and building suspense. I think that this book has earned it's place up on my cabinet.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|This album is a little bit softer and slower, but if you are a fan you can see the progression though out the albums.  To me, this might be one of their greatest. The lyrics are well delivered and well written, just like the older stuff.  With a more mature sound they take you back home.  This is a must have.      Don't want the whole album?  Check out,  \\"The Face\\" and \\"The Immortals.\\"  They are my favorites.  All are great, but for some reason those hit home.      Cheers.

B004INHTK4|4.0|The Violin is probably a significant 'character' in this book. After all, it's the violin that ultimately breaks the mommy Tiger's back and causes the chasm between the mother, author Amy Chua, and her youngest daughter, Louisa (Lulu).<br /><br />The first born daughter, Sophia, learns and excels at piano and accepted the strict 'Chinese' parenting. But Lulu rebelled, even from her days in the womb until, in her early teens, she won a fight in Red Square and took up tennis, after so many years mastering the violin under the ever-watchful eye of the Tiger mother.<br /><br />Most of the book speaks to the virtues of strict, over-bearing parenting. How important it is to instil self-discipline and hard work in your children. Practice, practice, and more practice to finally get good at something, like playing the piano or violin. It's only then that you really start to enjoy it and receive accolades from outsiders.<br /><br />Most readers may be shocked with how demanding and uncompromising Amy was raising her children. This is highlighted in her chapter, 'The Little White Donkey,' where daughter, Lulu, gets threatened with all kinds of bad things until she can master the \\"schizophrenically different rhythms\\" with two hands on the piano, playing the French composition by Jacques Ibert.<br /><br />Amy was born and raised the Chinese way by her immigrant parents, and married a Jewish Yale law professor, Jed, who helped to provide a balance to their family dynamic.<br /><br />The author makes clear in the beginning that she uses the term \\"'Chinese mother' loosely.\\" After all, strict, over-bearing parents can come in all kinds of shapes, sizes and nationalities.<br /><br />The book is about Amy's journey as a parent, raising two young daughters in much the same way her parents raised her. As the girls get older, and more mature, she realizes it's time to let go and to perhaps start adopting a hybrid of both Chinese and western style parenting methods.<br /><br />An intimate, inspiring and rewarding book to read. It's stirred up a long overdue conversation about parenting, and education.d up a long overdue conversation about parenting, and education.

B0040UAYI4|4.0|I'm an avid video gamer. I own over $20K in games and accessories. For the longest time i didn't play many FPS on consoles simply because aiming with an analog stick was a pain in the rear. I finally broke down and purchased this item. The accuracy it great, the movement is awesome. The only problem I've had with it is that with sudden mouse movements aka twitch reflex, it doesn't track all that well. You have to move your mouse slower than you're used to with a PC FPS. Once you get the hang of this, is prety darn good. The fact that the firmware can be updated is another plus! The 2.0 firware addressed and fixed a lot of issues people were having with it. The only other occasional problem I've encoutered is sometimes your mouse will \\"lock up\\" for a second while you're moving, so basically the mouse movement won't register while you're pressing a directional button, but this isn't all that often and I'm sure it will be rectified in the next firmware update. My Kill to Death ratio went up from an average of 10/8 to a 10/2. I just played MAG earlier today and left a round with a 26/2 RATIO! My oponents were PISSED! Prepare to be called a hacker/cheater because even with the occasional glitches, you'll still own everyone else in the game (unless they have one of these as well lol). If you love sniping then you'll be in heaven with this!  Overall, an 8.5 out of 10 (with a 10 being exactly the same movement as a PC).
B00005QBUK|5.0|I cant imagine fumbling around with those tiny earbud style headphones that are common now ,with the fragility of the small wiring also taken into account. These just hang on a hook or my neck when not used. I mostly use these for yard work, snow removal chores, or jogging.  I bought a few of these for fear of eventually not having a pair of them. I always have satisfaction with Sony products. The design is simple and these are pretty rugged also. Nothing lacking in the sound quality category that I have ever noticed.  Hard to lose a pair of these.
0451228375|4.0|It isn't easy writing a sequel to perhaps the most beloved novel of your collection, albeit a 1,000 page one. What impresses me most about Follett's writing, is his ability to incorporate numerous characters and give them a very surreal imprint throughout the story. Character development is his strongest utilization, and it is very easy to be able to sympathize (as well as loathe) the people that Follett conjures on paper.    While \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" bestowed more of a glorification of the medieval period through the context of the beauties of the construction of a cathedral, \\"World Without End\\" is a story about the shortcomings that are obviously apparent when one thinks about the Middle Ages. The church, once the progressive catalyst for advancement, is now more of a conservative, reclusive cult more focused on material extravagance. The bold appearance of the Black Death illuminates just how bleak the study of medicine was. The concept and importance of \\"science\\" wouldn't become central for several more centuries, but the results of the devastation caused by one strain of bacteria are shown to a very gruesome degree. And, finally, the negligence of the Church and the onslaught of the plague bring the struggle of the peasantry versus the nobility into primary focus.    The major flaw that I saw with this book is its level of predictability in comparison to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". Many of the major characters could directly be linked to their ancestors down to a single physical detail. Merthin to Jack, Caris to Aliena, Ralph to William, etc.     However, Follett is able to take this same formula and design it into something that works. It is fresh and entertaining, and it clearly illustrates just how great of a storyteller Ken Follett can be with a bleak time period nearing one millenium in the distant past.

0385523912|5.0|It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\"concentration camp\\" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. 1989, Tinamen square, a million chines college students marched to protest against their communist government of oppression: it was broadcasted all over the world, they were asking communist government to give them ;freedom for speech, media, business, religion, true-democracy( not like few communist party people controlling) by election. Sooner the communist government sent them tanks and guns and indiscriminately shoot them and ran over with tank. Whole world watched through television broadcast. There is no \\"equal Justice\\" like the communist ideologist deceives people. Only \\"Elite Party Comrades\\" have the privileges of special health care, food market for themselves only, supply stores for them only, but the rest of the citizens live in dirt poor situation deprived from basic human rights. It's just a power shift from have to have not. Maybe somebody to arrange some \\"exchange living tourism\\" between these communist countries and America, Send those \\"Deceived communism lovers\\" to live in those communist countries for a year or two years by themselves without any privileges as American, but just as like their citizen, then maybe all these communism, socialism, totalitarian  movement in American will learn the true lessons of the reality, and waken up. Also, reading the books by real defects form those communist countries will give real ideas, not just full of bologna, lying ideology (theory) books<br />Now some ignorant Americans already forgot about this just 20 years ago's brutality that we watched with our own eyes, want to change this great nation into communist?<br />Please study the real history. I mean the \\"real history\\" not just that stupid \\"ideology of communist\\". In a word, if you study the true history, communist repeatedly failed last 150 years.<br />and it's the most evil regime in the history. Why?: Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.<br />Men can't govern themselves.

1600108512|5.0|This is a beautiful hardbound collection of all six of 'The Last Unicorn' comics, based off of Peter S. Beagle's novel of the same name.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, and although I am a huge fan of the animated film version of the book- I was delighted that the artwork and elements taken from the book were fresh and did not follow the exact same approach that the film did.<br /><br />The writing is distilled from the most lyrical elements of the novel, a perfect amount to fit the space and pacing of the comic.<br /><br />Thank you so much! Now I have my love of 'The Last Unicorn' and comic books combined. Please do yourself a favor and get this immediately. Even better, go directly to Conlan Press and support Mr. Beagle. I plan on getting a second autographed copy from the author on that site.
0812976525|5.0|This book is really funny!! I seriously couldn't stop reading it was so fun! I think I finished it in a day or two (And I am the type who usually gets bored and leaves books unfinished halfway). I love Buckley's satirical humor and clever lines! And even though Nick Naylor may be a \\"bad person\\" who's job is selling a product that kills millions, his character is likeable and I sympathize for him and like him.    I totally recommend this book for a humorous, entertaining read!
0618001905|5.0|I was never a big fan of history in school but I do like politics, so when my daughter told me that I would like King Leopold's Ghost, I was a little skeptical. But the book captured my attention from the first page and didn't let go until the end. Adam Hochschild tells a story of slavery in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I had expected that the story would have taken place in the 1700's and 1800's but slavery lasted in the Congo up until the early 1900's, under the auspices of the Belgian Royal Family. The story is about the fight by several Europeans to stop the slavery and then price that these people paid for their efforts. Hochschild provides an abundance of historical background, so even if the reader knows nothing about the subject they will be brought up to speed very rapidly. Hochschild was never heavy-handed and even pointed out that slavery in Africa was not a phenomenon brought by the Europeans. I recommend that the reader have handy a map of Africa so that the places can be put into context because a lot of the story revolves around location. The book was very insightful and it was a very worthwhile investment of time. Although the subject of the book was depressing, the time spent reading it was enjoyable because of Hochschild's story telling.

The choice of singers is awesome! Mark Tornillo is Brian Johnson, Rob Halford and everyone in between! This is what an eighties metal band is suppossed to do, get better with age! Accept has drawn the line in the sand. Can anyone, old or new, step up, much less cross it? I think if Mark had been in the band years earlier, Accept would have been at the top of the pile long ago!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are the best headphones I've used so far.  I researched many models and settled on these for the price point, quality and ease of ear cup replacement.  They take a while to get used to since they make a nice seal over the ear.  I wasn't looking for bass heavy headphones and these fit the bill nicely.  Sound is accurate with no distortion at higher volume levels.  The coiled cord is heavy and quite long, works well if you need to move around in a pretty large area.

B003EW4KB6|5.0|Upon my first listen I did notice that the high frequencies were a little on the low side. But you know what - if you like the sound of records, then this can be really refreshing. Too much high information will have you turning the volume down instead of up. The Who demand high volumes! For each successive song, I ended up turning the volume up higher and higher to really grasp the detail of this recording. The sound stage is amazing. SACD is incredible in this regard. Roger Daltrey's voice comes alive on this recording. Reminds me of some MFSL LP recordings where the vocals stand out more. And Keith Moon's drums sound more alive. Guitar work and bass are way more accurate sounding. This is a must purchase, especially if you like to hear the Who loud! Don't pass this SACD up...

B003EYVXTG|5.0|Great, rare American movie where none of the actors seem to have had plastic surgery or went on a crash diet or visited tanning salons.  A-PLUS just for that aesthetic stance: what validation that people can be wrinkly or chubby and still be beautiful and attractive.<br /><br />There is nothing cute about this lower class family.  Life is just tough.  Main character a 17 year old herself has to teach her 6 and 9 year old siblings how to hunt squirrels with a shot gun because if she dies, how will they feed themselves.  Being poor is depicted as that - it's a shabby life.  It's no illusion of \\"look, they're just like us, but with less money.\\"<br /><br />The drug dealers' lives are not romanticized and glamorized - it is just another rough and unforgiving way to eke out a living in this godforsaken region.  The only other choice seems to be to join the military and run away.  Or hunt your own protein.<br /><br />Which would you rather have, life on welfare in the city or life on the land in the country.  They both suck.  Life sucks.  It just does.
1594202842|5.0|After reading this book, I've realized why my mother, who is a Chinese immigrant, raised me with a similar way Amy Chua raised her kids.  I remember getting into an argument with my mom when I couldn't go out with my friends to see a movie, she told me that I should spend more time studying math (because I had trouble with it) than spending time with my friends.  I thought she was be ridiculous and evil, but I soon realized why.  I got a bad grade on a math test and my mom proudly exclaimed, \\"I told you so.  You are worthless.\\" in my face while I had tears in my eyes.  Although it was a painful moment, it made me work harder and put more effort into, and in no time, my hard work showed improvement.    In other comments/reviews that I have read about the Tiger Mother, other Chinese individuals disagree with Chua's vision of how the Chinese raise their kids, claiming that it's not Chinese at all.  The reason why they disagree is because they were never raised with 100% traditional (<--keyword) Chinese rules of parenting.  Anyone who is/was raised by Chinese parents can agree that more than once in their childhood, his or her parent(s) has used the Tiger Mother method.  Being raised by Chinese parents is extreme tough love, but it's a tough world out there and they have the weapons to prepare their kids.    I can remember other times my mom threatened to kick me out of the house, or that my friends were better students and daughters than me.  One time I spoke badly to my dad and he said that he wouldn't love me if I did that again (lesson learned, I never did again).  Threat, criticism, or no love, that has made me into a strong, confident, and positive person who loves her parents.

The biggest benefit I found was in finding it when it was thrown out of the bed.  Can't tell you how many times we had to hunt for the pacifier for my older grandson.  You wouldn't think those things would go far, but they do.  Now, I have a new granddaughter coming in a couple of months.  My daughter-in-law loves monkeys and is using a jungle theme in the nursery.  How could I resist the monkey Wubbanub?
B0015DROBO|4.0|There were a few short-comings that prevent a five-star rating, but the wild roller-coaster ride that Larsson puts us through is very entertaining and compelling to keep flipping the pages.  There were a few \\"what on earth?!\\" moments that I didn't see coming, some great reveals along the way, and a few times where you want to pump your fist and yell \\"Yeah!\\"  The character of Blomkvist can be seen in many stories but it is Salander who really makes you compelled to learn more.  She is socially awkward and with Larsson providing so very little about her inner-workings makes you want to know more.  Well done, I look forward to the next two books.

This book answers many questions and to my delight, it ADDS a few more so we have something else to look forward to!  It's not a fluffy, predictable romance.   It is dark, gritty, entertaining and best of all, EPIC!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

1600610234|5.0|If you are someone who's interested in concept art, or concept design, you should check this book out. The author goes through his design process step by step.  He gives a good methodology for the successful development of the project from the initial stage, through the finished product. Usually all we get to see is the finished piece, and where this book really shines is in how it demystifies the process that the author goes through to create the final piece. A highly recommended read if you wish to create your own designs.
0307266303|5.0|I feel like most running books don't tell a good story. They can be a wealth of valuable info or offer great tips but really, I am not entertained.  I liked this guys story, I liked how he writes, and I burned through this book in a weekend.  A great new look ar a very old sport!
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a \\"mechanic\\"- an assassin with a talent for getting the job done the way it needs to be done, whether making it look like an accident or sending a message.  After an extended opening sequence to show off Arthur's skills he goes to meet Harry Foster (Donald Sutherland) his mentor and long-time friend.  Harry despairs over his relationship with his estranged son Steve (Ben Foster), who's never lived up to his potential.  Arthur is contracted by one of his employers Dean (Tony Goldwyn) to take out Harry over a botched assignment stemming from leaked information- which only a select few had access to- and does so reluctantly.  After his father's death Steve spirals into self-destructive behavior, fueling Arthur's guilt and forcing him to accept Steve's ironic request to learn the business.  But how long can Arthur keep his involvement in Harry's death a secret from Steve?<br /><br />This is another flick with great promise that comes up a tad short.  It gets into the darker aspects of human nature- namely greed, violence and guilt- but in this modern age of emo-heroes/anti-heroes, it never finishes the job.  The closest it gets is with Steve's character who in the wake of his father's death seeks closure and a direction in life as well as wanting to understand what it is to kill someone.  The sequence where Steve has to eliminate a man who completely outclasses him illustrates the last perfectly.  Even after being warned against trying to take him on physically Steve does so anyway, with predictable results, but it fits his character.  After seeing Arthur strangle a target Steve chooses to do the same with his, in order to truly feel the moment.  There's also Arthur's lack of emotional connection; his only tethers are a bar slut whom he likes but can't seem to completely reach and Harry.<br /><br />The movie's a lot of typical fare; the assassins are portrayed as better than their targets by virtue of their ethics and facets of humanity even when faced with the true nature of their business.  The plot hook hinges on an all-too obvious twist that even the high-schoolers sitting behind me were making fun of.  There's much more drama than action here, which wasn't bad but the action has no real flow to it; the fights and shootouts always feel like they were dropped in instead of part of the story.  Statham is his usual brooding self, Goldwyn delivers some personality and Sutherland as usual has a great presence in his handful of scenes.  The best guy here is Ben Foster, who I'm not familiar with but liked a lot.  But the ending was too damn cheesy and tricksey.<br /><br />'The Mechanic' will surprise you with some of the directions it goes in, but veers off-course a bit.  Simply put- it needed a little tweaking.faced with the true nature of their business.

0765348276|5.0|I'm a romance reader and my husband is the scifi reader. He gave me this book and said it reminded him of my father and I noticed right away it was written by a male who can never get dialogue right or have a tendency to get all jane-austin-sih with paragraphs that become chapters. I was hesitant but he told me to try it, I'd like the Sergeant. So, I figured I'd spend 5 minutes with the book and then I realized I was up to where they got green skin and then came the Sergeant from hell and at that point I was hooked and I finished the book in 5 hours. I had to sleep. I ordered the next book in the series and am eagerly awaiting it. Scalzi, at least in this book, can write short sharp paragraphs leading the chapters that don't get bogged down in too much physics but just enough to explain skip without your eyes crossing for those of us that aren't hard science PhD candidates and so it flows nicely. I like this universe and I'm happy to get away from fangbanger romances or the typical mage/young boy or girl who saves the world with their special powers type of science fantasy books. Can't believe this was written in 2006. Where was I?
1439196834|4.0|This book is hilarious! A great conversation starter or piece to display on your beautiful coffee table...IF YOU'VE SEEN THE SHOW! The \\"plays\\" are references to different episodes of \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" where they acted a few of them out on TV. Not meant to make anyone a \\"pick-up stud\\" in the real world. I will say this: I think it would make an excellent birthday or Valentine's Day present for a guy. It's just the kind of humor most guys would appreciate.
B0039UTDFG|3.0|This is an amazing series, but I agree with the other reviewers who recommend getting the David Attenborough version instead of this one.  Not only is he a more compelling narrator than Oprah, but the Oprah Blu Ray is in the 1080i format, while the Attenborough version is all 1080p (except for 1 segment).  If you have an HD TV that can view video in the 1080p format (as most new ones do) you can definitely see the difference between the two.  And 1080p is significantly better, particularly with the kind of stunning HD photography this series features.  I strongly suggest the Attenborough version for both of those reasons.
0316069485|5.0|It's a family affair. Mickey Haller (lead prosecutor), with the help of ex wife (second prosecutor) and lead investigator Harry Bosch (half brother of Haller), attempt to convict an accused child murderer, Jessup. This is a must read!!! Just as good as 9 Dragons, except The Reversal is more geared towards the law and courtroom feature.
076115678X|5.0|Having struggled with managing my curly hair all my life, this book as well as the products created by DevaCurl are a major blessing.   If you have curly hair, you NEED this book. Your hair will thank you for it!!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I just finished THE WAY OF KINGS with a flurry of reading that I've never experienced before.  I was amazed at how everything came together in the last 100 pages of the book.  And be best thing about this is that the previous 900 pages were great on their own - not just a slow ramp to the ending (actually beginning!).  By the end you finally see the importance of each of the 3 main characters - and even the most prominent and scary of the \\"side characters\\" - the Assassin in White.  The last group of chapters are just amazing - you'll know when you are getting there and make sure you have a block of time set aside when you get there because you will NOT want to stop once things start falling into place.    I believe one other reviewer mentioned how this book goes into the very tricky realm of leadership - and shows just how good leadership really works.  I can't agree more.  Kaladin and Dalinar (2 of the 3 main characters) both learn what this is as the book goes on and good lordy do they ever \\"get it\\" in the last chapters.  Dalinar in particular will shock you towards the end - you'll see what I mean when you get to that part....lets just say his title of the Blackthorn finally becomes clearer (no not in an evil way).    Most agree that Kaladin is the most interesting character - but I really put Dalinar right up there with him.  He undergoes quite an amazing transformation as the book goes especially at the end.      I fully recommend this book to anyone who wants to step into another world and \\"ride the storms\\".  Never has 1000 pages blown by so fast....

1416914293|4.0|SYNOPSIS:<br />Clary Fray wishes that life would go back to normal. What exactly do you call 'normal' when your father is probably insane, your mother is in a magically induced coma and you can suddenly see things like vampires, werewolves and demons?<br />Sure, Clary would love to go back to the way things were when she spent all of her time with her best friend (now possibly more) Simon. But the Shadowhunters aren't exactly ready to let her go, especially Jace - her newfound brother. And Clary can't just bail on her mom. To help her mother out, Clary will need to track down Valentine: rogue Shadowhunter, crazy, evil and... oh yeah, her father!<br />If that doesn't complicate things enough, someone slaying Downworlders in NYC and draining them dry of blood. Some think it's the Children of the Moon, but other signs are pointing to Valentine. He has stolen the second Mortal Instrument, the Soul-Sword and he's up to something. The Inquisitor for the Shadowhunters believes that Jace is in cohorts with his father. Can Clary trust him?<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />I am really enjoying this series. Cassandra Clare lures you into this world full of amazing creatures, fantastic settings and tons of action!<br />At then end of City of Bones, I really enjoyed both Clary and Jace as lead characters. Clary has come into herself a little more in this segment of the series. She's not as weak and she is learning to stand up for herself and her friends. She is truly beginning to grasp her role as a Shadowhunter. Jace is a strong male lead, still very witty and cinical. He's slightly more bitter after the revelations he received in City of Bones. I feel for both Clary and Jace and hope that things will clear up for them further on in the series.<br />As I posted in my review for City of Bones, I stated that Valentine didn't feel like much of a villian to me. He stepped it up in this book, but I'm hoping that in City of Glass, he will truly encompass EVIL.<br />Clary, as a Shadowhunter, shouldn't really be on a friendly basis with Downworlders. In this novel, she seems to befriend someone from every walk of life (or death): werewolf, warlock, vampire. We begin to see that as much as each hates the other, they can all come together for the greater good: to stop Valentine.<br />I have City of Glass sitting right next to me and am so eager to get it started!is with Downworlders.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|I agree with the person who wrote ignore the 1 star ratings. This movie is a \\"HOOT\\", great story with lots of action. Those who rate it lower due to incredable situations need to remember this is a movie not a documentary. As my Aunt Bebe used to say \\"try it, You'll like it\\".
1416914307|4.0|SYNOPSIS:<br />Now that Valentine has the Mortal Cup and the Soul-Sword it's only a matter of time before he goes for the third Mortal Instrument, the Mirror. The Clave has called every active member who can be spared to return to Idris for a massive Council meeting to decide what to do about Valentine.<br />Everyone is going to Alicante; The Lightwoods, Alec, Isabelle and Jace. Clary has finally figured out a clue to waking her mother up, and that clue lies in the City of Glass. But Jace doesn't want Clary in Idris, and he will do anything to keep her from going.<br />Even if Jace doesn't want his little sister following him around, Clary is determined to get to Idris any way that she can. Never mind that she's breaking the law by entering the city without the Council's knowledge. Once there she finds an unexpected ally in mysterious Sebastian, who is oddly familiar and more than willing to help Clary.<br />With the Glass City in danger, as well as all Shadowhunters and Downworlders alike, can they put aside their differences (Jace and Clary, as well) and fight together to stop Valentine from destroying everything and everyone in his way?<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />Once again, I just have to say, WOW! This was an amazing ride! Ms. Clare takes you on an amazing, thrilling journey in this installment of The Mortal Instrument series. I'm not going to say much, because I don't want to give anything away. I want you to read this series and see for yourself how awesome it is!<br />The characters really take that final step to becoming who they are meant to be in this read. They are very intense and strong-willed. I really grew to enjoy each character in this book.<br />I felt for Jace and Clary through their battles, those that were internal and physical. There was so much this time around that they found out about each other, themselves and their lives.<br />It was an intense read and I loved every second of it. I am so excited that the story will be continued in City of Fallen Angels, and can not wait to see what Cassandra Clare comes up with this time around.<br />If you haven't started this series, I recommend you pick it up!at Cassandra Clare comes up with this time around.  If you haven't started this series, I recommend you pick it up!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I purchased this for one of my best friends at Christmas. Although it's a different kind of music than what he normally performs, the songs on this CD are amazing! We'd really only heard of 1 or 2 songs when we ordered it, but now we're officially addicted to them all. Definitely catchy! Really awesome CD for a pretty great price.
B004GNYGTI|4.0|Wow! I read all the reviews here and am stymied. Having worked in television and film, and as a journalist/critic, I have to preface my remarks with a little proverb: \\"it is what it is.\\" This film makes no pretenses. It is a girl-kicks-ass, action flick, not wholly unlike Gena Davis'The Long Kiss Goodnight. All this talk about character and story development....balderdash! How much backstory do we get in early Bond flicks? It is formulaic and we dig that we know what to expect: action, action and more action....then there is the sex, but, in this, Salt is her own sex symbol, so why muddy up the waters with a token, male piece of ass.<br />The first act, where she runs from the CIA, after being exposed as a Russian mole, is pretty intense, action-wise. If you take nine minutes to watch the video on making the film (available on Video-On-Demand for free) you will see that Jolie is into the physicality of the stunt work.....and does she get to play here!<br />Although the slim storyline is reminiscent of Bond films, it is the incredibility of the stunts that make it exceptional. There is little or no method acting involved, all physical. Dialog is almost non-existent. But, of course....it's not about wooing the viewer, but, rather, getting the viewer to grip the edge of their seat.<br />Yes, it is open-ended, but with the Bourne Trilogy don't we ask ourselves WWJD (What would Jason do?). Here, I wonder, as always mystified, WWJD (What will Jolie Do?), and as always, I am pleased as punch (pun intended).

B003V4AK8E|2.0|I purchased this controller when it first came out (wireless version) with high hopes of getting a 360 style controller for my PS3.  I have both systems and prefer the 360 controller by far.  My first controller had a faulty X button, so I had to send it back for a replacement.  Once I had my replacement, I initially really liked the controller.  Shape and comfort were great, and although the triggers are still spongy, they overall shape is much better than the DS3 with their convex triggers.  Easier to use them as God intended them...to shoot your guns!  :)    After a little time with it, I noticed something wasn't \\"right\\".  I couldn't play my games the same way as I used to, and I had a general discomfort with input commands on the controller.  Long story short, the dead zone is CONSIDERABLY larger than the DS3.  Like, ridiculously big.  It makes aiming and moving that much more difficult; and precise movements are nigh impossible.  Couple that with the lack of bluetooth support and the controller turned out to be a big dissapointment.  Sadly, I returned this controller and am considering trying out the Nyko version.
0525951652|5.0|Another Ken Follett masterpiece! This book is a brilliant piece of historical fiction. The intertwinig lives of the five families from five countries involved in the buildup to and the critical battles of WWI add personal implications to this world changing event.The characters are three dimensional and representional of their heritage.   This book is a must read for anyone interested in 20th Century history.The individual story lines are organized in a way that is easy to follow and encourages the reader to keep turning the pages for more. It may be long, almost 1000 pages, but I found myself wanting more.I eagerly await the second book in this trilogy.

B001EN1R2M|5.0|This is the first, and, in my opinion, one of the best Motley albums of all time. From the opening riffs of Live Wire to the live recording of Merry-Go-Round, and everything in between, this does NOT stop rocking. Motley were at their raunchiest and sleaziest here, and helped define 1980's hair metal. More important then their well known image as bad boys is their ability to write catchy and memorable songs. If you like any kind of pop-glam-hair metal, or any of Motley's newer recordings, you'll love this. Highly recommended!!!
1439107955|5.0|As the employee of an NCI-designated cancer center, I often have the pleasure of working with medical oncologists and their patients. I had a prefunctory understanding of cancer. I knew that every cancer is not created equally. And that most people have a personal experience with this crafty opponent -- whether it be their own experience or the fight of someone they care about.  In explaining cancer, the author uses language that the lay person can understand. Even though the main \\"character\\" is a deadly disease, the book is hard to put down. By the time I finished reading it, I was invested in the Jimmy Fund and Carla's story and Dr. Farber's research. This is far more than a text book about cancer cells. Any one who wants to have a very basic understanding of a very complicated subject would benefit from reading it.
0756655307|3.0|Full disclosure: my basement's got over 40,000 comics.  There's little in the superhero genre that I haven't read in the past 35 years and Marvel has been a good sized part of that.    My wife and kids gave me this book for Christmas 2010 and it's sweet.  I love looking at the pictures with my three year old son and telling him all of the characters names, secret identities and whether they are good guys or bad guys.  I like the inclusion of character art from every era and as we browse through the book together it's a lot of fun to see all of the information that's in here.    But, as I dig deeper and actually *read* the book my enthusiasm lessens.  It's clear that the selection and weighting (especially for the \\"Updated and Expanded\\" portion) reflects more about 2009 Marvel politics and sales than it does the actual history and characters.      There are 2 and 3 page spreads devoted to throwaway 'events' from the past few years while concepts that rewrote the entire Marvel canon such as Heroes Reborn are reduced to a single sentence buried in an entry for Onslaught.  As much space is dedicated to the last 5 years of post-disassembled Avengers history as to the previous 40!    The selections seem to pick and choose characters, plot lines and emphasis based on whether or not Marvel had a solid relationship with the creative team as of this update.  Everything touched by Brian Michael Bendis is given a place of honor (there are 78 unique entries in the Index referencing 2008's 'Secret Invasion') while everything Grant Morrison brought to the X-Men between 2001 and 2005 is completely missing (there are no entries for Xorn, Beak, Phantomex, etc.).  Guess who was writing at least 6 monthlies plus all of the 'events' in the Marvel Universe in 2008/9 and who wasn't working for them at all?    This book came out at $40 new and is listing near $80 used as I write this.  That's way too much to charge for something that falls this flat.  That kind of money buys a lot of fullcolor back issues if you just want something fun for the kids.  For anything more than a casual fan you'll get more history by picking up a half dozen 'Essential' books with material from the 60's and 70's.
030746363X|4.0|Tim provides an entertaining overview of a diverse group of interesting body-hacking experiments, and provides a good perspective on why and how.     Generally the ideas are well laid out and can be slightly supplemented to implement for yourself.    The stories are impressive though tend to be anecdotal rather than scientifically documented.     The only caveat I find is that Tim refers to his own efforts, which generally look like transitions from one stage of good health to another, and so it is unclear how much of the improvements and changes are new achievements he is documenting or if he is merely returning to previous form.
B0006ZFQP8|5.0|While I love the classic, critically acclaimed recordings by Furtwangler and Bohm, if I had to choose only one recording of this opera, it would be this one. It does have its minor quirks, and Kollo is not my favorite Tristan. But after years of loyalty to the \\"famous\\" recordings, I finally had to admit that overall, I enjoy listening to this one the most. And isn't that what listening to music is about: enjoyment? I think classical music lovers (including myself) often fall into the trap of buying or listening to something just because the \\"experts\\" recommend it. While there's nothing wrong with consulting informed opinions on the many choices of classical recordings, in the end they are only opinions. Try to hear samples or borrow recordings to find the version that is best for you before buying, or own multiple versions if you can afford it.     There are many reasons I like this one best. You may or may not agree, but try to hear it for yourself before making up your mind, instead of trusting negative reviews. In my opinion:     Kleiber's conducting is adventurous and refreshing; just be aware that it's very flexible in tempo, as can be heard in the climax of the Prelude. Price's Isolde is simply gorgeous, so who cares if she never sang the role on stage?! Kollo is a decent Tristan, better than you might have been led to believe, though Vickers is my favorite. And during the love duet, Price and Kollo sound more beautiful together than any other pair I've heard. Their voices actually harmonize instead of clashing because of wide vibrato (a common problem in this scene). This is very important to me, and one of the main reasons I like this set so much. The rest of the cast is fine. Who can complain about Moll's rich bass or Fassbaender's attractive mezzo? And I've never understood those who criticize Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in Wagnerian roles; I always enjoy his singing. And of course, the sound quality of this reissue is excellent, very warm and lush, whereas the original issue was fine but a bit steely. So for sheer enjoyment, I recommend this set above all others I've heard, though you should hear the classics if you can.
0439023483|5.0|I haven't been able to put this book down! Okay, so I did sleep last night, but other than that - It is not out of my hands for more than 5 minutes!    I was nervous to purchase this (on my nook) because it is for \\"Young Adults\\" but I think this is appropriate for adults as well. It is an easy read grammatically, but it is intense in plot though (no spoilers here!).

B003YFIUW8|5.0|All I can say is \\"Wow.\\"  This book was one of the most thought-provoking books I've read in a long time.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have been an avid reader for over 20 years, averaging 3-4 books per week.  The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins is definitely one of my top 10 favorite reads.  The whole series is engrossing and entertaining.  I finished the second book before the third came out, and it was one of the hardest waits I've ever had for a book to be published.  Everyone I know has loved this book, from my 11 year old son to my 63 year old mother.  Highly, highly, highly recommended!
B00447G2PM|4.0|This is truly a fantastic way of being introduced to what 3d capabilities your television has!  I purchased this and several other movies in 3D and I am pleasantly surprised with it.  Although they are pricy now (it's new technology still--- high demand low supply) these will soon be on the 9.99 rack so don't worry!  In the mean time we do have to pay though :(  I watched this on my samsung plasma 50\\" looked amazing!!!
1594202842|3.0|Like many reviewers, I have mixed feelings about this book.  I don't dismiss Amy Chua as \\"Mommie Dearest\\" revisited, yet the expression, \\"there's more than one way to skin the cat\\" kept lingering in my mind as I listened to the unabridged audiobook.  I do believe that Amy Chua wants the best for her children, and I believe that she really loves them.  However, I personally do not like to be motivated by insults and unhelpful and untrue character judgments.  I prefer the \\"Dale Carnegie\\" method of motivation.  Jim Fay has a parenting version of the Dale Carnegie method called \\"Love & Logic.\\"  You don't insult or disproportionately punish your children.  \\"Love & Logic\\" involves choices within limits and follow-through with reasonable consequences for misbehavior.  Yet would this Dale Carnegie method realistically motivate your kids to practice the piano for five hours a day, even while on vacation or with a 102 temperature?  I don't know.  Maybe you do have to use a harsher method to get such compliance and performance results.<br /><br />I love music and would have loved classical music lessons while growing up with the resources Chua provides for her kids.  As an adult, I am taking piano and voice lessons, and finally am self-disciplined enough to practice the piano for at least forty-five minutes daily (not quite on par with the Chua five to six hours, but much better than the sporadic practice habits of my previous attempt to move beyond the early intermediate level).  I actually LOVE practicing the piano now, where I never really did when I practiced haphazardly and unfocusedly (that's provided I have access to a better quality piano than my on-its-last-leg spinet).  The reason I mention my own discovery of a belated passion for the piano is that I did need to be pushed to practice before I actually loved practicing the piano.  I pushed myself because there was no Tiger Mom to push, encourage, cajole, insult, or threaten me.  Amy Chua made a good point when she said words to the effect that once you gain mastery (or in my case, greater skill) with an instrument, you can really delve deeper into it and enjoy it.  Chua's daughters do love music and their respective instruments, but they were arguably pushed too much and needed a breather from their intensive practice and performance regimes.  Chua did seem like she was in part living through her daughters when it came to their music lessons.  Lulu even said that she didn't want Chua to ruin tennis like she had ruined the violin for her.  Yet Lulu admits to loving the violin and missing orchestra.<br /><br />Chua mentions how her Chinese father had called her \\"garbage\\" when she insulted her mother. She said that it was water off a duck's back in that she knew her father didn't really mean it and that he had a very high opinion of her.  Well, that's well and good, but you don't need to say the same thing to your daughter.  That's not acceptable.  If people could just rephrase things, they could make the same point without gratuitous emotional abuse.  \\"Your behavior is garbage\\" or \\"I don't appreciate how you are treating me right now\\" is very, very different from \\"You are garbage.\\"  Why an otherwise intelligent woman doesn't check herself to rephrase her sentiments or get that she can't use a cultural analysis to excuse saying crappy and abusive things is beyond me.<br /><br />Amy Chua does seem to be very competitive.  She is successful within her field and that strategem may work for her.  However, I like the idea of striving for self-excellence and self-competition (self-improvement) rather than competing against other people with a scarcity mentality.  Amy Chua arranged for her daughters to excel at school and reach prodigious heights with their respective instruments.  I just think that maybe she could have done it in a kinder and gentler way, neither Chinese nor Western per se, just kinder and gentler.

0805028846|3.0|This is a beautiful book, but pretty \\"high level.\\"  We bought it to help with a 4th grade pop-up project, and it was too advanced for that purpose.  Would be good for an adult interested in paper art.

1603420398|4.0|This book is exactly what is says it is, Motifs. So, I was not surprised when I did not find any patten ideas for putting the motifs together, however, I was a little disappointed though. There is a page of doodles that gives you ideas about what to do with the motifs, but that is all.<br /> The patterns are quick and easy to follow. There is a color guide for each pattern but the color and brand of yarn used is not listed on the patterns (which is probably not the point of the book in the first place). The photo's are colorful and clear.<br /> This book is good for when you just want to crochet something quick and relax. Putting together your creations is the next stop in the journey.<br /> A companion book would be a nice thing to buy along with this. Preferably one that shows how to construct projects out of motifs.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|This movie is wonderful!  A great sequel!  But the Blu-Rays from Amazon were damaged.  I bought 2 and both of them were scratched.
030758660X|4.0|This books is quirky and fun. There are beautiful patterns and lovely photos. The patterns themselves can be a bit confusing, the format could be better (but, that's getting finicky).<br />I love the \\"Tid-Bites\\" throughout the book but, I wish there had been more mention of different vampires. As with all things \\"vampire\\" nowadays, Edward Cullen and the Vampire Diaries' Brothers were all over that book. There was one mention, that I've found, of an Anne Rice character (and that was in the vampire quiz).<br />I also adore the section for Shape-shifter knits and the embroidered knit bags. This book is really good for a base to make your own ideas!<br /><br />All in all it's a good book if you're a vampire fan, and great if you're trying to teach knitting to a younger student. They would be all over this. But, if you are a strict twilight hater, I wouldn't advise buying this.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|This is not only an excellent movie but the blu-ray version makes it so much more enjoyable.  The scenes are just amazing!
B000LY9TBQ|5.0|Words cannot describe how beautiful this album is, and i can see there is already a good review on it, so i'll try to not go too deep into it. However i must disagree with one reviewer who said this wasn't yes' greatest album, and say, yes, it is. now this album has gotten a really bad rap in the past and a lot of people can't grasp the beauty of good prog rock, but that does not subtract from the fact that it is, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums ever released, most certainly as far as classic prog rock goes. now i understand it is not catchy, it doesn't have a beat you can dance too, the tracks are an album side long EACH, so of course it never got air play and didn't get very popular. this is an album that you sit down with and listen to all of it in one sitting and allow your mind to wander to places you couldn't even dream of. it paints mental pictures that i can't describe. on the other hand, though, if you aren't a very good yes fan or a very avid prog rock fan, you probably won't like it, it's more of an acquired taste but one you will adore for years to come. and it is most certainly a must for vinyl, it truly does make all the difference to hear the delicate, warm and mellow tones in their true form, as close to actually being there when they recorded it as you can get.

B000UD0ESA|4.0|Yes, this was the clearest and sharpest Blade Runner I have seen. For that reason I think it is worth having in your collection. But my set only came with one DVD and the only feature it had was an Introduction that explained how they made it a cleaner copy. The other times I had seen Blade Runner it was always very dark. Perhaps this was the way it was intended to make the viewer sense how dark they thought the future would be. This one seemed to cut off some of the ending. Because it seemed to me when Harrison Ford left with Rachel they were leaving the city for the country and he was talking about how she had a normal life span v.s. the four years. But maybe I read this somewhere. I did feel disappointed when they got in the elevator and that was it. Worth the money, if you can get it cheap.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Wow. The first time I saw it, I thought it was an okay movie, I didn't understand why there was such a hype over this movie - maybe because it was based on Facebook or maybe because the main actor (Eisenberg) was from Zombieland. I just didn't get why there was such a hype. When the movie hit DVD, I bought it for the low price ($13) and watched it again...and I was speechless. It was truly amazing. Andrew Garfield, my favorite actor, is in it and he was amazing in it. He is such a good actor. I just thought the movie was extremely good. I haven't watched the special features yet, but I will try as soon as possible. And for a deluxe edition and for the low price. It's worth the $13.
0316077054|4.0|After reading beautiful creatures I got the feeling something was missing... the story revolved more around the girl LENA and not enough about the boy Ethan. Although this book is more centered in his story and there are some interesting and complex moments, i feel the story needed more maturity and more carful planning as there are some moments i get tired of so much of the same... it's a bit repetitive and sometimes even boring... I really loved the first one.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|*DVD Review*<br />Ryan Reynolds is an extremely good actor who usually makes really good movies, I don't recall any movies of his that I didn't like except for The Proposal - which was a weak romantic comedy. I loved Just Friends/Waiting.../Van Wilder/Buying the Cow. I thought this one (Buried) was just - I'm not sure how to say this but - weird. Your just watching Ryan Reynolds talk to people through a cell phone/ect. The movie is strange, but the funny thing is, is that it isn't a horrible film, but not an award winning, which you can tell it was supposed to be. I watched it and I predicted the ending (and I was correct). But the movie isn't that long, but it is enjoyable. It seems like a PG-13 thriller since there's hardly violence, it's just language. The movie is pretty good and probably one of those movies you watch one time.
B001TH8UUA|4.0|I ordered 2 Amazon cables and a Mediabridge brand at the same time for my PS3's. I like the mediabridge cable better. It feels much more substantial than the Amazon cables. Although I have to give props to the Amazon cable for better flexibility. Have not tried it with 3D content yet, but wanted to be prepared. No specific complaint, just that the Amazon cable construction feels cheaper. Only time will tell.
B000UJCALI|4.0|I had never seen this 1980 film before because I generally avoid films dealing with the supernatural.  But now, more than 30 years later, I wanted to check out what this famous Stanley Kubrick film was all about.  Well, it sure is a horror film.  It held my interest throughout and kept me at the edge of my seat, waiting for the next surprise that this famous director had in store for the audience.<br /><br />The acting was exceptional.  Jack Nicolson and Shelly Duval star as a married couple with a six year old son who agree to be caretakers in an isolated luxury hotel during the winter months.  The child has an imaginary playmate and hears voices and sometimes he speaks nonsense in a grown-up adult voice.  Jack Nicolson seems like a well adjusted teacher who craves the isolation in order to write a book.  But he soon turns into a homicidal maniac.  His performance is nothing less than absolutely great and is certainly one that skyrocketed him to a fabulous career.  Shelly Duval is lesser known but I am surprised her name is not a household word.  She has unique looks with gigantic eyes that express the horrific conditions she is thrust into and I just couldn't take my eyes off her.<br /><br />Then there is the plot, of course, which was adapted from a Stephen King novel.  It is weird, twisting and held my interest throughout.  And yet it made no sense.  Frankly, to me, the movie was just a vehicle to watch Shelly Duval scream and Jack Nicolson gradually go insane.  Yes, the film was well crafted by one of the greats in the industry and the film has become a classic in every sense of the word.  However, my logical self yearned for a plot that made sense and a satisfactory conclusion.  But I guess that is just too much to ask for with this kind of film.
0596009208|5.0|This book absolutely rocks.  Every chapter makes me laugh.  It says everything I need to know without any extra fluff or confusion.  My professor used it as the textbook for his class and it was fantastic.  The only thing I'm mad about is the waiting list of people who keep stealing my copy (I haven't seen it in 6 months).

0316067938|1.0|I'm 62, love knows no age, and fell in love with Edward when I saw the Twilight movie a year ago.  He deserves an Oscar for best Vampire role.  I took the movie characters and went back and read the entire series.  I loved all 3 of the movies, whereas I liked the books.  My biggest criticism is how Myers, in the Twilight book, has Bella tell Edward she knowns he is a Vampire.  The movie version was so much better, more intense.    Unfortunately, Breaking Dawn was a hugh let down. It felt as though Myers had locked away the first 3 books for ten years and then came back and hurriedly wrote the conclusion -- forgetting her own tone and style of the first 3 books!  In some places, she lost the plot and the characters themselves.      Why bring in all those new characters to fight the Volturi when there is so much left to learn about the Cullens? A couple maybe, but a dozen or more! Maybe she was trying to set up characters to continue the series.  I truly hope she doesn't try to continue it.     If \\"our\\" Alice had put the wedding together, it would have been much more elaborate and special.  It reads as if Bella put it together.  And Bella would be the first to admit that her character has no style and lacks pizazz.    Edward is a Vampire. Vampires have no blood, don't sweat, can't cry and certainly can't get humans pregnant! And Bella, at 18 as a mother, I don't think so. She wanted only to share private time with Edward, having a baby made no sense and just should have been left out.  And OMG yes, please give that little girl a normal name.    After the wedding, I became toally confused.  The book became a jumble of 6 books all thrown together, some not even based on Twilight! No wonder they are making the book into two movies -- way too much going on.    However ... my biggest dissapoint of all wasn't Myers fault, it was the script writer for Eclipse. In the last few minutes of the movie Bella says to Edward, \\"it never really was a choice between you and Jacob.\\"  Ifyou listen to Kristen Stewart's commentary on the DVD, even she gets upset and says \\"There's no way she would have said that.\\"    The entire series was based on her love of Edward, it made no sense for her to say that.  Edward was everything to her.  Bella was going to give up breathing, her family, everything to be with him.  What was the point of the first two books?   The entire series is based on Jacob and Edward trying to win her love --  it is  the major plot theme in the series. Now she says it wasn't true, she did it for herself.  I don't think so. I wish KS had pushed to have that line deleted.    The only thing that might help readers forgive Myers, is to go to her website and locate the 200+ pages of Morning Sun, written from Edward's perspective.  It is so fantastic, I keep going back to reread it. I wish that they had come out together.  Not as one book, but at the same time.  It really provides such a deep understand of him, his love and his hunger for Bella.    We can only hope the screen writer for the movie version of BD remembers what the series is about, what is important and eliminates the rest. I know she has the baby, but then to have Jacob imprint on her.  Really weird and a bit creepy.  Besides, Jacob deserved someone special, certainly not Bella and Edward's child!      So dear Stephanie, I believe you owe all of us die-hard fans a rewrite of Breaking Dawn.  But first reread your first 3 books, then finish writing Morning Sun -- then try a rewrite of BD.  We deserve better and so does the wonderful series.      And if you can't rewrite BD, then please, please keep writing the Morning Sun series exactly the way you started.  In my view it is better than any of the Twilight books.  It helped me forgive you for messing up BD.  But oh yes, please stop with his version of Eclipse!  I couldn't bear trying to read Edwards viewpoint of BD.      p.s. Bring back Edwards beautiful hair in BD. It is so sexy and a big part of what gives him that unique,beautiful look. It was perfect for his role. Most of the Cullens had wild hair, strange colors.  The all kept their hair for the series.  Bring our long haired Edward back, that's the guy we fell in love with.

B003INBOEM|5.0|\\"Ip Man\\" was a great action movie that was based on an actual historic event in China. I have been a Martial Arts practitioner for many years. It's quite difficult to find a Martial Arts movie that I can truely appreciate. When you know what you are looking at, you tend to analyze the styles and technique. Donnie Yen was perfect in his role as Yip Man. Even if you are not a Martial Artist, this movie is a great action flick that can be enjoyed by all.
0545123275|3.0|This book is really a typical young adult novel. It seems as though the author got a lot of her ideas from Twilight and ran with it. Nothing too original here.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This is a CD that goes deep into the soul.  The songs are for the most part mournful with Loreena's voice beautiful as usual as is the instrumentation in the music.  Inside the CD cover, she says ;that \\"Every once in a while, there is a pull to return to one's own roots...\\" and that is what this is, a return to her roots.<br /><br />An aside which isn't reflected in the rating--why cardboard covers?  The CD's get scratched easier that way.  And I was disappointed that the lyrics weren't printed in side the cover as her previous ones have been.

0470913029|4.0|Professor Cordain is well qualified to write this book. He is the author of more than 100 peer-review articles and has been a full professor at Colorado State University since 1990. According to Cordain, the typical Paleolithic diet compared with the average modern American diet contained about 4 times more omega-3 fats, and about half as much palmitic acid (the main saturated fat that raises LDL.) This is in spite of the fact that they consumed the entire carcass of the animal. This is because they ate wild game (average of .89 grams saturated fat per serving) instead of grain fattened domestic animals (average of 7.04 grams saturated fat per serving). Other books written by nonscientists may disagree but they rely on other books written by nonscientists. The world is full of hypotheses that are neat and plausible but wrong when actually tested. Cordain actually gathered the data and did the calculations. Paleolithic diets ranged from very low to very high in saturated fat consumption. They were not uniformly high as alleged by some writers.     In studies, the average person who tries the Cordain Paleo diet sees their HDL go up, and both their triglycerides and LDL go down. The average person who tries a high saturated fat Atkins diet sees both their HDL and LDL go up and only their triglycerides go down.    While some modern humans may be sensitive to beans and grains, several scientists believe that 10,000 years (500 generations) was ample time for allele frequencies of existing genes to adapt. \\"For example, alleles conferring lactose tolerance increased to high frequencies in Europe just a few thousand years after animal husbandry was invented, and recent increases in the number of copies of the gene for salivary amylase, which digests starch, appear to be related to agriculture.\\" And three of the longest lived groups in the world (people eating a Mediterranean diet, the Japanese and vegetarian Adventists) eat more beans and whole grains than most Americans.There has been little time for people to adapt to grain fed meat, table sugar and refined grains, but much more time to adapt to beans and whole grains.

B003VWU2WA|4.0|Being under impression of few positive reviews about Powermate working as a spinner with MAME Arcade emulator, I have decided to purchase one. How much disappointed I was once I discovered that Powermate does not work with newest MAME32/64 GUI emulator. I have tried to contact Griffin support, but despite of several emails received with long delay they were unable to help. I was close to return Powermate and get my money back when I tried one more time with older version of MAME (0.90b) and found Powermate to be working perfectly. When configured as mouse, Powermate works great as a spinner in games like Arkanoid or my favorite Tempest arcade. Built quality is great and I am planning to include Powermate on my DYI Arcade machine project. Highly recommend for all Tempest fans, great product for a fair price.

0887306667|5.0|Though the book is a bit old, the ideas are as fresh and useful as ever. Jack Trout has distilled the essence of what works in advertising and why. Presented in a clear and concise format, you won't be scratching your head but grabbing your notebook instead--to write down all your ah-ha moments. It is just as important for the business owner, product developer or entrepreneur as it is for the professional. But if you work in the advertising field, as I once did, reading this book should be the very first \\"to-do\\" to pop up on your brand new iPhone. It will open your eyes, and inform all your decisions going forward.

B004HWYTP4|1.0|Worst movie I've seen in awhile - and I'm counting the movies on LMN.  It's predictable, corny, and boring.  The first 1/4 of the movie seemed somewhat tolerable, but it never got any better.  I'd rather be stuck in traffic for 3 hours than watch this movie again.

0783229372|2.0|\\"The Hindenburg\\" is a wonderful film that is in desperate need of a re-mastering.  The DVD uses the standard definition (480-I, with 120 lines of color) master created for the stereo Widescreen LaserDisc that was released on April 18, 1991.  Sadly, that transfer was so bad that the very first release of \\"The Hindenburg\\" to home video, on December 15, 1978, (as a CAV - Standard Play - 5-sided MCA DiscoVision LaserDisc release for $15.95) actually has better definition and sharpness - and without the bugaboo of the widescreen transfer's HORRIBLY excessive edge enhancement - the DiscoVision discs' only drawback is a pan & scan transfer and mono sound from an optical release print. The edge enhancement of the Widescreen LD/DVD transfer is so excessive that I really can't think of any other title, not even bootleg videos, that contain a higher amount.  Everything seen on the DVD looks as if it's a 2nd generation VHS dupe that's been put through a Photoshop \\"emboss\\" filter about five times.  It's really that bad - anything smaller than about 100 lines of resolution is etched out of the image with a HUGE white line around it. It's so bad that the Widescreen LD edition from '91 was considered over-sharpened even back then!  And add to the fact that the image isn't enhanced for 16x9 televisions only makes it look worse.  In addition, the transfer shows the garbage mattes around Albert Whitlock's breathtaking matte paintings and the beautiful model work of the ship as it's floating through the sky - kinda like the garbage mattes around all the ships in the original Beta, VHS and LaserDisc releases of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\".  In every respect, a new High Definition transfer is called for - and one that doesn't suffer from ANY edge enhancement, unlike many Blu-ray's on the market now (such as \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\")    MCA/Universal Studios originally considered releasing \\"The Hindenburg\\" in SENSURROUND, but didn't beacuse \\"Midway\\" was in production with itsrelease date up in the air and SENSURROUND was being re-engineered into SENSURROUND MOD-II, which made it unsuitable for magnetic stereo prints - plus, many 2nd run theaters were still showing \\"Earthquake\\" in SENSURROUND, which was tying up all the SENSURROUND Horns and Control Boxes (which were slated for circuit modifications into Mod-II when the equipment was returned to MCA Systems (the technical subsidiary of MCA/Universal)  So, \\"The Hindenburg\\" went into theaters with 35mm Panavision prints and a STUNNING 4-track magnetic stereo mix.  The stereo/surround sound mix was considered so advanced and breathtaking, with such deep bass and sparkling treble, that many in the industry said that they had never heard anything that matched it.  Not only did it have incredible surround sound and fidelity, but also fully directional dialog and, thanks to Westrex, Ampex, RCA and MCA's own work on the mag print striping, recording/playback heads, mag equalizers and the actual magnetic particles, the film had a frequency response and dynamic range that rivaled 70mm mag prints - plus, the re-engineered mag surround track (which was narrower than the 3 other tracks on mag prints and thus noisier) was quiet enough that it no longer required a 12kHz switching tone to turn it on and off (which, before Dolby and dbx noise reduction, was used on mag prints to prevent audiences from hearing mag hiss from the surround/effects speakers).  The DVD and WS LD releases are plain old 2-channel Dolby Stereo - in other words, 2-channel stereo sound with the Surround and Center matrixed in (and the beautiful directional dialog de-directionalized into mono), requiring decoding with a Dolby Pro-Logic decoder.  Because of this, Pro-Logic decoders have a heck of a time separating the sounds and steering them correctly without audible sound pumping or sounds shifting.  In many scenes set in the Hindenburg's interior, there is dialog in the Center Front channel with other sounds, such as the creaks and groans of the airships Duralumnium skeleton and wires in left and right, while the surround track contains other sounds and deep, full rumble of the airships exterior engines. This is a no-no for Dolby Stereo (surround) soundtracks because it's absolutely impossible for the channels to be separated at the same time.  The theatrical release got around this because of the fully discrete 4 channel prints.  Now that we have 8-channel discrete digital sound - lossless on Blu-ray even - the Hindenburg deserves an HD release that takes full advantage of its wonderful sound mix.     In terms of extras, except for the trailer, there aren't any on the DVD - which is sad considering that Universal made a documentary about the making of the film - it was a 15 million dollar production, which was a LOT of movie at the time, and Universal was rightly proud of it - any new release should have this included.  Plus the deleted scenes - while the film didn't suffer from extensive editing, there were a few scenes cut before it opened, and these should be available too.  Universal has treated \\"Earthquake\\" and \\"Rollercoaster\\" similarly on DVD with their lack of easily available extras.  At least \\"Earthquake\\" on DVD is from a newer, anamorphic, 24 fps, 1080-P High Definition transfer with an \\"attempt\\" to give the effect of SENSURROUND in the home.  And the same goes with \\"Midway\\", but in that case, the DVD is chock full of extras, plus the shot-later, made-for-TV scenes.     In terms of historical accuracy, the inside of the ship is spot on.  The Zeppelin company gave the filmmakers previously un-released blueprints, diagrams and specifications for the Hindenburg, and Universal copied them exactly for the sets.  Even minor things, such as the number of rivets and their placement, were duplicated precisely.  The walls of the staterooms were made from the same lightweight materials as the original - leather was used for the walls in the dining room, etc.  Placement of items such as ballast storage pouches and Duralumnium tanks were correct, as was their exact size.  Details, that most people would never notice, such as the emergency steering wheel in the bottom tail fin of the ship, are correct.  \\"The Hindenburg\\" is James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" of 1975 in terms of getting the ship right.  Even Hindenburg historians have to be careful because they can't tell otherwise un-identified photos of the movie's sets apart from photos of the actual ship.  It's THAT good.    Now we just have to get Universal - Comcast, ugh! - to give us a Blu-ray release!  Along with \\"Earthquake\\", \\"Midway\\", \\"Rollercoaster\\" and \\"Battlestar Galactica\\"!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had been eagerly awaiting this book for a long time. When I read it I found what I had expected. Great writing and wonderful character development. I would really like to praise Collins for doing this once again.    What I was a little disappointed in was the way in which Katniss is presented. She is supposed to be daring and strong willed. I think that some of this is in Mockingjay but I always hoped that Katniss would fully recover from that unstable state of mind that she seems to be in for most of the book.    I have to say that I was always Team Peeta from the beginning but I thought that the way she dropped Gale was shocking. The reasoning behind her choice was understandable (to a certain extent) but I wish that Gale could have had his last say.    Still I will recommend this book to anyone I can because it is powerfullt written and is an exemplary show of Collins' work. Have fun reading this fast paced and well written work!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok i said one of the best because this one is the second best in the series. I like mockingjay a little better. Im only eleven and ive read this series about nine times. Its better than Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and even the warriorcats!!! M my sister, and my mom checked out the whole series from the library and we read the whole series, all of us put together, in four days!!! When it was my turn i spent two all nighters reading it. From beginning to end, this book is going to keep you reading!!! Its action packed, violent, entertaining, and sad.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />When Katiss volunteers for Prim i cied. When Katniss and Peeta got lit on fire, i gasped. When they got launched into the arena I wondered what would happen. When Katniss found out Peeta was inside the career pack, i abhorred him as much as Katniss. When Peeta saved Katniss I was surprised. When Atniss made the alliance with Rue I was happy that they were friends. When Rue died, i cried. when cato died i was grossed out.<br /><br />All in all, these books are perfect for anyone with a taste for violence and AWESOMENESS!!!!!!
B00364K6YW|4.0|Love the story.  The picture is clear, sound great.  I would have liked to know that it is shown as a Mini-series and not just a straight movie.  I really don't like the ending/beginning of the segments of the show, but that is the only thing I don't care for.
0689835604|5.0|My son loves this book. He is very into belly buttons, which is why I  bought this book for him. The book goes through several different parts (i.e. eyes, toes) and isn't just about belly buttons. My son is also a big fan of the lift-the-flap books. He will often laugh out loud like he's playing peek-a-boo with the book. The flaps on our copy haven't fared so well. In his excitement, my son his ripped a few of the flaps off of the page. They are made out of a lighter-weight material (it feels like a thin cardboard) than the sturdier pages are made of, but my son loves this book so much that I will be ordering another copy of it for him.
0385341679|1.0|Let me start by saying that I followed the ENTIRE series for YEARS! YEARS! And when I got the last book I was so excited and after the first chapter I thought YES! This is going to be good. And then I waited and waited and WAITED the book was WAY longer than it needed to be. I felt like the ending was an extreme let down. Not only did it just end but it left the possibility of another book. Um really? After this many years I felt like the book could have been WAY more climatic, packed with way more action and be more of a page turner. The only page turning this book had was in hopes of getting to the 'good part'. It was a lot of repetition, and talking to herself which just got boring after a while. People we're brought in that didn't really have any part and the people that had parts did really live up to them in the end. Don't get me wrong I love Karen's books. Most are wonderful. This series however was anything but. In fact instead of having the book spread into so many parts over the course of so many years it really could have been done in one. With a way better ending. If there is another series I think I will wait until all the books are out instead of waiting for years for such a let down.

B0041QSZJM|5.0|The Scrooges who dislike Christmas albums were totally taken in by this album.  New songs like the Ukrainian carol are most compelling.  The Little Drummer Boy found new life and a new rhythm.  If you are already a Pink Martinin fan, you must add this to your collection and will play it \\"off-season!\\"   If you don't know Pink Martini, you will find this to be an exciting album that might stir interest in their other albums.  This turned out to be the hottest holiday gift we gave to friends and had others asking us if we had any left over!  It is better than chocolate!!
B003274QH6|5.0|The entire show is ver well done.  It has a great cast.  I was not expecting something like this, I thought Bryan Cranston was great in Malcom and always thought of hime as a commedian.  This isn't Malcom and Bryan Cranston is excellent in this show. Season 1 and 2 were on sale and I thought that I sould just purchase season 1, in case it was like the Pacific, not very good.  I should have purchased season 2.  I will an Season 3 also. Well worth watching.
B0035WTJFW|5.0|I had already owned the film, not the Blu-ray release.  I have yet to view the new release, but I did thoroughly enjoy the inovative stle of the not to far future, and love any type of science fiction,or future that lies ahead! It will be a treat when I find the time to view this wonderful film.
B001S33D1G|1.0|So terrible. I had read reviews of the movie that said it brought familes together. It was just a nightmare of a novel about a girl who discovers evil in her house. And to make it worse, her parents become the victims, and she has to fight the evil alone. It's a \\"young adult\\" novel because the language is simple and the protagonist is an adolescent. But the scenes are the kind of things that haunt you and will make you afraid of your own home, your own bed. I can't believe this kind of thing has a willing audience.

0061120073|4.0|Engrossing and timeless, if you want to time travel for a few days into Brooklyn a hundred years ago, read this book. My only caveat is that, like most coming-of-age novels, the character goes through a period where she is struggling to decide what she believes about God. She decides that she doesn't believe, and the scene where she decides is compelling... In fact, it's as if the entire book, her entire life, leads up to the point where she decides that there really is no God, but \\"life\\" and \\"beauty\\" and \\"education\\" and \\"love\\" are all good enough for her. It's anti-climactic when you know that those things really AREN'T worth it. Those things disappoint. Those things fail. Those things vanish away... Too sad, really to know that there are plenty of people who also have come to that same conclusion in life, and the beautiful stories that could have been told end in darkness and as much hopelessness as they began.  Sorry for completely ruining the novel for you. I enjoyed it while I was reading it. ;-)
B004AKCMD4|4.0|As the title suggests this is a fun movie.  Not the best movie ever but I personally enjoyed it.  Before buying I might suggest renting it first to see if you like it enough to buy.
0439023513|3.0|It was exciting and I was very happy to have some resolution. But I was getting a little bored with \\"Katniss passes out and something incredible happens and she wakes up and gets the full account of all the action we missed.\\" I lost count of how many times it happened in just this book, but having just read the first two within the past few weeks, it got old...quickly.
B002HML6Y8|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you liked wolverine origins this one should definately be added to your list.
0307408833|4.0|First, it's a fun, beautiful and inspiring book, gets me excited to get in the kitchen and try these!  Second, the recipes so far have been well-received by my family.  I thought the blueberry muffins had a teeny bit too strong of a lemon extract flavor (might have been my fault, maybe my teaspoon was rounded?) but my family didn't notice that at all and loved them. (We frosted them with the vanilla frosting recipe and they called them cupcakes :)  They also loved the zucchini muffins (again, couldn't resist adding frosting and made me smile even wider when my son was loving his zucchini cupcakes ;)  Will soon be trying out the corn bread, carrot cake muffins and then for my son's birthday, actual cupcakes!  So far, I am really enjoying this book.
0307595579|3.0|Of course, they were cheap.  A whole set for the price of a paperback? I'm realistic, I expected rough paper and facsimilie quality print.    What I didn't expect were rough cut pages. Not only are they ugly but they make it very difficult to turn the page.    In hindsight I may have spent more, or bought them individually. I was attracted to the fact they were hardcover.    Many years ago a bought a series of classic books. They were on cheap paper, but they were better bound and the pages were crisp and clean. They were a much better purchase.     If I had seen these in a book store I would have passed them by.  Still you get what you pay for - and as this is a long weekend in New Zealand and a cyclone is bearing down on us from Tonga - I'm glad I have three wonderful books to keep me amused.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|I grew up in the '60's.  Watching this on Netflix, I was struck by how accurate the show is in portraying all that was sleezy about that decade. The casual smoking, the excessive use of alcohol, the sexism, the racism.  It's a series that you will either love or hate.  As for myself, I'm halfway through Season One, and I still don't know how I feel about it.<br /><br />Compelling. A very effective presentation of that time, that place. With central characters you may not care for...

0307588343|5.0|I purchased the book months ago and placed on my pile of things to read.  Suspecting the story would be overly technical and a tedious read, newer books kept rising to the top of my priority list.  One day after hearing Mr. McDonald discussing the Lehman collapse on TV, I picked the book up and found I couldn't put it down. Surpisingly, the technical details never got in the way of an engaging story.  This should be a mandatory read for business students and more importantly members of Congress!!!

Slightly heavier feel than old Accept. I really dig the new singer, too.  Maybe doesn't quite top their early 80's stuff but it's a piece of good heavy metal music, old-school but fresh, which isn't easy to come by these days. Highly recommended to all heavy metal fans.
0674049160|4.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, a well-developed writer who has open many peoples eyes to the life of a girl in the 19th century, who lets you see through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet. Even though Ms. Austin wrote, the novel in 1797-1798 it wasn't published until January 1813 as a 269-page novel. She makes the unique, creative style flow really well through the pages but also a pleasure to read because of her artistic style shown thought out the book.<br /> In Longbourn, England, in the Hertfordshire country town, you are introduced to the Bennet family. The Bennet family has Mrs. and Mr. Bennet and their 5 daughters: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Catherine, and Lydia. The other crucial characters that you are introduced to early on is Mr. Bingley, Miss Bingley, and Mr. Bingley's best friend Mr. Darcy. The minor characters who do a lot to shape the story are George Wickham, who is an officer in the British forces, Lady Catherine de Bough, who is Mr. Darcy's aunt, Mr. Collins, who is the Bennett's cousin and who marries Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte, Georgina Darcy, who is Mr. Darcy's little sister who was formally engaged to Mr. Wickham.<br /> The conflict that is presented to the two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, is when Mr. Bingley moves in next door with his sister, Miss Bingley, and Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's best friend. When they move in next-door Mrs. Bennet starts her scheming ways of trying to find a husband for one of her daughters, who she then asks Mr. Bennet to ask Mr. Bingley to come over so she can get her one of her daughters to sweep him off his feet. After Mr. Bingley comes over to meet the family he invites them to a party he is going to throw. At this party Mr. Bingley, Miss Bingley, and Mr. Darcy arrive, Mr. Bingley spent most of his evening with Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter, well Miss Bingley, and Mr. Darcy didn't really associate themselves, with the \\"commoners\\" of the town, and put themselves above almost everyone else at the party. During the party Elizabeth is sitting down with her friends when she hears Mr. Bingley tell Mr. Darcy to go dance with her and she hears Mr. Darcy say, \\"She [Elizabeth] is tolerable, but not handsome enough for me; and I am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.\\" After Elizabeth hears Mr. Darcy say this, she becomes foul towards Mr. Darcy and decided he is a horrible grouch. During the time that passes Jane is asked to go see Mr. Bingley's house for dinner and get sick from her walk to the house in the rain. As the result of her sister getting ill, Elizabeth walks to the Bingley's house to take care of her sick sister. During her time there, Mr. Darcy starts to get feelings towards Elizabeth but Elizabeth has nothing but disgust towards the man after hearing what he said about her. Well sometime passes after this and Mr. Bennets Cousin Mr. Collins comes to stay with them. Mr. Collins well there has planned on finding himself a wife, and decides during breakfast well there that he was going to ask Elizabeth to be his wife, well Elizabeth being the stubborn person she is said no and said she never would. Shortly after this, Mr. Collins marries Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend. As time passes and life goes on the Bingley family and Mr. Darcy moved away without any warning, left Jane heartbroken over Mr. Bingley, and left Elizabeth with more hatred for the family then she already had. Over a long period of time an officer by the name George Wickham, Mr. Wickham, starts hanging around the Bennet family and gets extremely close t Elizabeth, but was called off to the service and left Elizabeth without any answers. With Mr. Wickham gone and Elizabeth feeling somewhat down, her aunt and uncle show up and invite her on a trip through the countryside.<br /> During the trip to the country side the climax hits when Elizabeth's aunt and uncle carriage gets stuck on the Darcy's property when they decided to go up the house for a tour of the manor Elizabeth gets nervous; since the last time she saw Mr. Darcy he had pronounced his love for her and she had said she would never love him. As the tour went on, she asked the guide if Mr. Darcy was home and she said no which gave Elizabeth some peace about being there. As Elizabeth was going through the house she heard a piano being played and decided to find out where it was coming from. As she opened the door to see where the music was coming from when she saw Mr. Darcy hugging his little sister Georgina Darcy. She was startled and made a loud noise which caught there attention. As soon as Mr. Darcy saw that it was Elizabeth he introduced her to his little sister and insisted that they stay for dinner. During the time that Elizabeth spent with the Darcy family she got a letter that one of her sister was sick and she left. At the moment she got the letter Elizabeth decided that it wasn't a option and left to go be with her family. When Elizabeth went home she helped take care of her sister. As the months went on Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy showed up outside the Bennett's house. It took them awhile to come to the front door but once they did Mr. Bingley asked Jane to marry him and a few days after that Mr. Darcy asked Mr. Bennet permission to marry Elizabeth and she said....yes.<br /> The purpose of this story is to show you that first impressions doesn't always mean you are going to feel the same way latter. As Elizabeth learned to get over her prejudice ways and Mr. Darcy got over his pride. In the end Jane Austin ended with the two most opposite people in the world fell in love and got to spend the rest of there lives together
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I will not go into great detail with my review as others have done so already. I watched the complete series on DVD and just finished the final episode this evening.<br /><br />The Tudors is one of the best series ever written for TV. There is nothing about the show that was less than stellar. The writing, the sets, the photography, the directing, the characters, the soundtrack were all exceptional. As for those who insist The Tudors is flawed historically I can only say this: people do not watch Showtime for their education. This series was created for entertainment purposes and it exceeded in every way the expectations anyone could ever want of a dramatic series and as such I highly recommend it.
B002WY65VU|4.0|I thought Zombieland would be awful based on the name and trailers. Boy was I wrong. This movie is just a ton of fun all the way through. Four survivors of the zombie apocalypse happen across each other, and must learn to live with each other to survive. It's not even really about the zombies so much, as it is about these four misfits actually intereacting with each other in all too hillarious manners; the zombie apocalypse thing just provides the background really. If you're worried you'll be too scared, or that you don't like horror, don't be. It's a comedy first and foremost, with characters that you'll feel good both laughing at and cheering for.

B003OML23K|5.0|Usually if a book is especially popular it is a huge turn off for me. So the fact that I read this and it is one of my favorites despite being popular is a pretty big deal. This book is set in the future, America has fallen and no one may leave their district. Every year the annual hunger games pull two children from each district into a life or death battle against other children in a special arena. The last one alive is the winner of the hunger games and their district receives extra food that year from the capitol. Katniss is the girl \\"representative\\" of district 12 and is the narrator of the story. In the \\"reaping\\" (where they draw the candidates) her sister was drawn and she did the unheard of- volunteer for the hunger games. The boy from the district is Peta, the boy who snuck bread to her when they were children and saved her from starvation. However, there can only be one surviver. The Capital is a glittering testament to the power that makes the government able to hold these hunger games as an example to rebellious districts. Some of my favorite characters are the fashion designers in the games (just a side note.) It is impossible not to fall in love with Katniss's character and care deeply whether she, and the friends she has made, survive the hunger games. This book is impossible to put down!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|When I read an advance review of Low Country Blues, I immediately pre-ordered it. When it was delivered, I was listening within minutes. And then I listened again. And again. Gregg Allman has the voice and lived the life to be a genuinely great blues singer.  T Bone Burnett knows the history and the sounds of old-style blues, and he put together a great back-up band and produced a sound that could have come off an old 78 blues album. And yet the songs on Low Country Blues - many of which will be unfamiliar to all but die-hard blues fans - are so much more than attempts to simply imitate old-style blues. Gregg's singing, the generally sparse back-up band and the wonderful interplay between the musicians (including - and I think it was a stroke of genius to add him - Mac Rebennack aka Dr. John} give the music a bit of an edge that makes it a delight to listen to. And now, enough writing. I have to go back to listening to this fabulous album.

0786956127|5.0|This set is a box containing a set of Dungeon Tiles previously sold in separate packs that had no container. The cool thing is that the top and bottom of the box aren't wasted: They're Dungeon Tiles, too!    The box isn't crammed full of Dungeon Tiles--I'm sorry I didn't count how many sheets you get, so that I could tell you in this review--but that just means there is plenty of room left over to add the tiles from one or two of the containerless sets you may have purchased.    Dungeon Tiles are printed on thick cardboard. They are high quality items. If you own any Fantasy Flight boardgames with good components, then you will be familiar with the level of quality here.

B004DIPLMC|5.0|Wagner's Ring \\"without words\\" is not a novel concept: Stokowski and some of his fellow-conductors have performed orchestral \\"syntheses\\" of Wagner operas, especially during the 1960s and later. There is nothing sacrilegious about orchestral excerpts from operas, though some critics have sneered at the so-called \\"bleeding chunks\\". Orchestral excerpts and syntheses will particularly please those who, for one reason or another, have trouble sitting through these endless operas - especially when they are celebrated on consecrated ground in Bayreuth. Maazel and the Berliner Philharmoniker (in huge complement) have recorded this performance in 2000 in the Berlin Philharmonie in excellent video and audio. It is a 78-minute tour de force, for the then 70-year old conductor as well as for the musicians who follow him on the beat and who often have to play grueling long fffs or harmonically challenging passages. In brief: they all work a small miracle, and the performance turns out to be stellar, passionate, powerful, ravishingly beautiful and utterly moving. Maazel lets you feel that underneath Wagner's amassed brass there is existential angst and there lurks the fear of a new era, hand in hand with this poignantly nostalgic last blossoming of late Romanticism. When the performance comes to a close, you will know that this is indeed the twilight of an epoch, for better or for worse. Get it while you can.
030746363X|4.0|Tim's style of experimentation has been the most interesting and the most useful information I have used to apply principles in my life.     Many of the principles he sets out to experiment with and demonstrate are simple and common sense, but the value is in the mad-man lengths he goes to document his methods and how well he communicates them -- and that is what makes this book so unique.

B000YAA68C|5.0|Very quick service and great movie!  However, on a separate note, I had ordered The Molly Maguires through Movie Mars via Amazon.  The DVD they sent me would not play in the US.  They informed me that it was a DVD which could only play in Great Britain DVD players.  I sent it back to them and asked them to send me one that could play here.  They did not but instead credited my account, less what they paid to send me the incorrect DVD in the first place, and apart from what it cost me to send the incorrect one back to them.  I don't feel I should have had to pay and shipping charges due to their error.  Also, rather than having my account credited, I would have preferred simply receiving a DVD which I could play!!!  Not happy!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|After watching the movie theatre cut I decided to see what made the director's cut different. It made a good movie great! Several extra scenes in the director's cut gave explanations for events that the other version  made no effort to clarify. It's a movie that I watch over and over.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I really enjoy reading political thrillers that are current for our times. Vince has a way of capturing your attention and taking you on a crazy ride. Another great debut author I just discovered is Al Boudreau, his novel IN MEMORY OF GREED is a great one to try as well[[ASIN:B004L2LJ94 In Memory of Greed]]
074322454X|4.0|This book gives a very specific point of view of World War II, from training through D-Day and to eventual victory.  The narrative follows the perspective of over a dozen men, who were interviewed and consulted during writing.    If you're already familiar with World War II history, this book is a great addition to your bookshelf.  However, if you (like me) are not very familiar with the topic, there might be other books you'd like to read first.  I recommend D-Day by Ambrose:  if you read that one, if you enjoy it and if you find yourself wanting more, then I recommend you follow it up with Band of Brothers.  I find myself thirsting for more WWII history after I've read the two books.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|this was a Christmas gift for my son. I enjoyed the series and my son has watched this several times he like it so much
B0040JHXTS|5.0|I was a huge Springsteen fan in the '70s and into the '80s, and i fact seeing him at Red Rocks Amphitheater outside of Denver in the summer of 1978 is one reason I became a music critic -- it inspired me with the power of rock and roll. In the decades since I've lost my zeal for his recent music But I was excited to hear about this set, and it delivers. It's not just about nostalgia, which is f course part of the appeal. The remake of the \\"Darkness\\" LP is fabulous to listen to. But that album was so... dark and heavy that it wasn't fun to listen to, certainly not as much fun as \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"The Wild, the Innocent....\\" The new addendum of \\"The Promise\\" fills that gap, and brings to official life many of the songs that have floated around as bootlegs over the years. They're fun, and reflect the growth process Springsteen underwent in those years.<br /><br />The DVD discs are also terrific time capsules of those years, both the \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff and the live concert video (I'll never tire of seeing the scrawny version of The Boss\\" jumping around and exploding with the sheer joy of rock and roll release from the mid-'70s tours). But surprisingly, the video I found the most captivating was the one bereft of nostalgia: The new live performance of the entire album. The songs rock and the performance is passionate. That's the piece of content that really made me appreciate \\"Darkness\\" all over again.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|I actually don't like it so much. It is interesting but a bit too stressful for my 10 years old daughter. We played it a few times and it always ended with quarrel.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I have been a BIG fan of this series as well as her other books. I could not wait to read this book after the \\"Cliff Hanger ending\\" of the last book. After the first couple of chapters I feel like the characters fell apart- she never did answer what is Barrons? Why can he never die? Why did his group not kill Mac?? To top off everything, Barrons grilling for the family?? who did he have this child with?? It feels like she just threw a bunch of stuff out there to try and get the book finished??
B004132HZS|5.0|This was an excellent portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.  It left behind the stuffy upper class English detective and brought him into the 21st century.  He's still condescending and arrogant, but he's also typical of the younger generation of today.  It reminded me so much of the \\"techies\\" of today that I had to buy it for my 23 year old son.  He agreed that it reminds him of a lot of people (himself included) of this day.  He enjoyed it and is looking forward to the next season (as am I)!  If you like mysteries at all, watch it; you WILL enjoy it:)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Plain and simple:  This is a great book to read. Fantastic characters, plot, story, message, this book has it all.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.  If you're a fan of sci-fi, it's a must-have.  If you're NOT a fan of sci-fi and are a fan of great books, it's a must-have.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|I ran across this DVD at a big box store one day and read the description on the back. It sounded good, but I wanted to see what other viewers had to say about it before I took a chance on it.  I was pleased that it got mostly favorable reviews, and since I really liked both \\"The Professional\\" and \\"La Femme Nikita\\" (which the director also did) I figured I'd take a chance on it and check it out.    After watching it, I can truly say that I loved it a lot more than I expected.  The characters were great and there were quite a few moments that were very heartwarming. One scene in particular involved Angela (Rie Rasmussen) trying to get Andre (Jamel Debbouze) to see himself as lovable and to accept himself as someone worthy of being loved. You really feel for him as he struggles to accept his self-worth after years of self-loathing.    One other thing I really enjoyed about the movie was that it was filmed in black-and-white. That's certainly not something you see very much nowadays. But it really added a lot to some of the scenes, as the director really took some beautiful shots with the actors. If the film had been in color, I thing that a lot of the details in the scenery would've been lost and the film probably wouldn't have been as visually appealing to watch.    I am very glad I got this and would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something a bit different for a romantic-comedy type of movie.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I don't understand why George Lucas refuses to give fans a high-quality transfer release of the original theatrical cuts of the Star Wars trilogy. For those of us who don't like the tweaks, the lame revisions (Han shot first) or the overdubbing (I liked the original Boba Fett, thanks very much), this release is just another slap in the face to film buffs, historians, and preservationists.    They say if you whitewash something long enough, people will cease to remember it. Sadly, that's what Lucasfilm seems to want to do - whitewash the superior versions of the Star Wars films until newer generations don't know any better.     Shame.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|Gregg has a sultry and smooth voice like an expensive bourbon.  It is clean and crisp with just the right tinge of age and Marlboros.  The production and recording value of this CD (produced by T Bone Burnett) is exemplary.  The tunes are bluesy.  Problem: lyrics are as redundant as a tape loop.  On every single song. Some songs are slow bluesy burners, some are uptempo \\"jigs\\".  None are scorching party-movers.  And all are plagued by repetative lyrics that go nowhere fast.  I am a lifelong Allman's fan... I have every single CD, including the Dreams compilation.  Their new tunes over the past decade, although passionate, have lyrics that are more bland than a faded billboard.  Deduct 2 stars.
1577314808|1.0|Mindfulness is a very noble concept and practice. It is a pity that this book, through repetitions, bad style and vagueness makes a very poor treatise and a vulgarization out of it. I started it with high expectations and towards the middle it became so tedious I couldn't go on with it. I (unfortunately) agree with all the negative comments and feel sorry for all those who gave this book positive reviews. There are much better books.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is an excellent DVD package featuring not only the movie itself, a timeless classic, but also some terrific extras, especially the reminiscences of Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews, the reunion of the actors who played the children, and the 'Biography' show on the von Trapp family.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|I was mostly interested in seeing this movie after I read the book, which I loved. (I actually listened to the audio book).  I wasn't interested in paying theater prices to see it, however. The movie is pretty good, it is different than the book, which is always disappointing. It seems pretty authentic from what little I know about Boston as I have only visited twice.

1400052173|5.0|First, a confession: I didn't buy \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" on Amazon.  I read the reviews here and decided that I wanted the book immediately, so I cashed in a Christmas gift card at a local brick-and-mortar bookstore.  I wound up paying full list retail.    It was worth it.    Many years ago, I worked as a research assistant at a university.  But until I read this book, it had never occurred to me to think about Henrietta Lacks, the person who had provided the original HeLa cells we cultured.  Nor did I wonder what it must feel like to be Henrietta's family, who learned decades later that her cells were living in laboratories world wide.  I didn't ponder whether those cells were \\"donated\\" or \\"taken without consent\\", or what other ethical issues might be involved.  In short, I was clueless.    Ms. Skloot did a fabulous job of presenting the scientific facts and human feelings of the family and researchers.  Her accounts of the individuals involved were sympathetic, but unvarnished.  It's really just a great story about humans and human nature.
B0040PYVTW|5.0|I just \\"discovered\\" Aloe Blacc on Conan's show recently, but he's been doing different musical stuff since the 1990s.  Here, however, his suave, sophisticated, and earnest performance of \\"I Need a Dollar\\" immediately caught my attention.  I looked up his latest album on Amazon(\\"Good Things\\"), auditioned several tracks, and he won me over.  This is classic Soul performed with lots of real soul. Reminiscent of Al Green and Marvin Gaye, but with his own vocal style, Blacc captures the essence of their musicality that gives Soul its own unique vibe.  The tracks are catchy and upbeat, even if the words often concern joblessness, lost loves, and desperation.  \\"I Need a Dollar\\" has gotten the most exposure so far, but every track has its own appeal, from the irony of \\"Miss Fortune,\\" to the lover's remorse in \\"Loving You is Killing Me.\\" After several more listens, I'm drawn even more deeply into this artist's soul-full mood.  This album is a gem, and it deserves Amazon's rating as one of the best titles of 2010.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Reign of Fire isn't really one of the more appealing suspenseful fictional tales out there mainly because there's downtime concerning segments devoted to pure boredom.  The actual dragon killings that take place however, are the reason this movie ends up with a decent enough rating to suggest watching it.    Whenever a dragon appears out of nowhere ready to leap down and flame the survivors, this is when my interest goes up a few notches.  However, the acting... it's pretty terrible.  It feels WAY too boring and cheap in a \\"Who cares what happens to the good guys?\\" kind of forgettable way.    The parts that had no dragon violence whatsoever were obviously trying to develop into interesting storyline segments, but unfortunately they never worked for one reason or another.  Just an overall lack of interest in all the main characters, really.    I can only recommend Reign of Fire to those who absolutely must watch a fictional tale dealing with frightening dragons going on a rampage and ripping apart the world a little bit at a time.
0385341679|2.0|I have actually already posted comments to the negative reviews. I have to say overall this book was a major let down. It seemed most of this book takes place with Mac constantly going over what/who she could be. She's kind of in her own head throughout what felt like the entire book. Shadowfever had its brief moments that I liked. But they were so few! I was just overall very disappointed in the way it turned out. It felt like useless information and way too much of Mac dwelling on her inner thoughts and identity crisis. After 4 books, I kind of wanted to be able to move past that! It got very very old. It was the first KMM book that had me skimming around because I was bored. Oh and I felt like there wasn't enough interaction between the other characters as well. It all seemed to focus mainly in Mac's head.     I also really wanted more tenderness between Mac and Barrons. Didn't get it. Yes, they had like two parts that might barely qualify as tenderness, but not very satisfying. I needed more after the tension that had been built throughout the first 4 books. It wasn't romantic. I do understand Barrons beast and all that, but Karen writes some great passion in her other books and those were some pretty tough guys as well. She could've given us a lot more than just lust between Mac and Barrons. Not even saying it had to be really mushy, but anything would be better than what we ended up getting! Also, 'Happily Ever After' in my book doesn't qualify as grilling steaks on the BBQ. No. Way.     Mac's self discovery (after about 400 more pages of her contemplating this) was not as epic as it felt like she originally was building up to! I'm so disappointed. I have completely adored all of Karen's books (own most of them), but Shadowfever was just a huge let down. I feel like Karen was going one direction throughout the entire series and then at the very last minute changed her mind completely. I felt like 'clues' she had apparently placed throughout the first 4 books didn't lead you in the right direction. She made it sound like it was possible to figure out the mystery, but in the end it wasn't possible at all! There are still SO MANY unanswered questions. TOO MANY. I actually have a few more new questions now to add to the pile!   Big one: What the heck is Barrons? So he's a beast? Does this beast have a name? I mean, really, 5 books, 5 years and we still don't know the actual identity of Barron's beast? No, that's just not good writing.     I would've liked to know what happened to Fiona, but Karen felt this wasn't important. She eliminated characters so quickly it almost felt weird and too easy! I also wanted a bit more on Christian. I understand he's getting more story in the future, but it would've been nice to get some more. I needed more info. on Barrons and his guys, but that may never happen. Everything with Dani is just abandoned.    I could go on. I'm sad this book was like this. I have tried to look at it with an open mind, but it's not happening. I have been discussing it with my mom and some friends and we all feel the same. We feel let down. I waited for an epic ending, I waited for my questions to be answered and in the end I got neither. I can't say I'm overly excited for more of Karen's future work. Her style has changed and if this is an example of what is to come in the future, I can't say I'm very interested.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I really like this product. It is very clever on how they make it able to slide up and down.
1594202842|5.0|Whether you agree or disagree with Amy Chua's Chinese parenting style (or even if you take issue with her definition of Chinese parenting), this book is fascinating. Among the ranks of tiny musical prodigies which can be witnessed on YouTube, there can be no denying that the vast majority are of Asian decent. I've always wondered why this was so. I knew it wasn't that Asian children are simply born with more musical aptitude than children of other ethnicities. There had to be a behavioral and cultural explanation. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother gives readers a glimpse inside one Chinese-parented home. We get to learn how musical and academic excellence are achieved in their particular family. It isn't always pretty, and it isn't necessarily a parenting philosophy others should emulate, but it IS a frank, humorous, and enlightening memoir that I have a hard time putting down. I highly recommend.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|Don't even questioning buying this album.  If you like any of the singles from Florence and the Machine, you will hear nothing but more of what you like.  This album has not a single dull song: I expected at least one poorly-executed, boring, obligatory electro-chanteuse number, but I am disappointed.  All of the songs are positively engaging and the lyrics are brilliant and provocative.  I write away quoted This Is Spinal Tap, saying \\"Every song on this record is a hit!\\" but I wasn't kidding.  \\"Kiss with a Fist\\" is probably the worst song on this album and it is awesome.    I also expected the album to sound as dry and non-musical as most recent recordings.  Instead the production and recording are superb, with clear keyboards, the harp and the awesome, loud drums.  I'm on the verge of not being able to listen to this while I work since I find it so captivating.  As I said, if you like \\"Dog Days\\" or any of the other singles, you will only hear more excellent, well-performed and well-recorded songs.  I already think Florence is brilliant and I can't wait to hear her next work.
0393330435|5.0|Steve Wozniak has been on my short list of heroes ever since I was in grade school. Therefore, I have absolutely nothing objective to say about this book... fond memories of my Apple II prevent critical thinking, and who am I to tell a genius, a living legend, and the embodiment of the American dream how to write his own bloody memoir?<br /><br />This is an OK book but a better story, a quick and easy read appropriate for all ages. Buy copies for the nerdy kids in your life - they might grow up to change the world.
B0001JXQDI|5.0|This SACD Hybrid far exceeded my expectations. It's clean and the mix makes great use of my system, which uses Magneplanar MMGs for the front, MMG-C center and MMG-Ws for surrounds.  Unlike a number of the 5.1 discs I've purchased, many of the tracks give each channel the attention it deserves.  It doesn't relegate the surround speakers to faint echo-like sounds.  Gaucho has moved up to the top of my list for pleasure and to demo my system for my friends.      If only Steely Dan would issue a 5.1 mix of Katy Lied!
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I kept waiting for this movie to get going... It never did. It was boring mixed with gratuitous, unnecessary sex scenes. Even the ending was horrible. I am much relieved I rented and didn't buy this terrible film.
B00275EHJG|5.0|When I originally heard Pixar was making Toy Story 3 I was a little hesitant.  Not because I didn't think they could do it, but third movies in trilogies are notoriously bad, never living up to the original two.  Not only does this not happen in Toy Story 3, but, for me, it actually surpasses both in its story.    The story is a very simple one, a story about what happens to toys when their owners grow up, or, in a broader sense, growing up and going separate ways.  This is a story everyone has either gone through or will go through, which is what makes it such an amazing movie.  With that said, this is not a children's movie.  I have read quite a few reviews on here complaining about their young children now have nightmares or were terrified by this movie.  While it does have a G rating, it is still a movie about abandonment, being forgotten, a desire to be loved, and accepting the inevitable.  These are painful life experiences, and the scenes addressing these don't hold back.  You see the despair and loneliness and go through it with the characters.  It's these moments, not funny ones (which I'll get to later) that make this movie so wonderful.  it will be much harder for children and teenagers to appreciate these moments, but those of us who have gone through the time in our life where we have to grow up and move on from our childhood, these are the best moments in any movie I have recently seen.    Even with it's dark tone, this movies still manages to be so much fun.  The introduction of Ken was a wonderful idea, and some of the scenes with he and Barbie are some of the funniest in the movie.  The Aliens from Pizza Planet and their relationship with Mr and Mrs Potato head was wonderful.  I don't know why, but I love those aliens.  Buzz in spanish mode was hysterical, and one scene involving parts of Mr potato head and a pigeon had me in tears.  Those are some of my favorite parts of a great movie.     The basic package of the movie is just that, basic.  Therewas nothing special to it, but I bought it for the movie, not the extras, and the movie has no problems.  The picture is great, as well as the sound.    This movie is a great movie, a wonderful movie, that has moments that almost everyone will enjoy.  It's not a child's movie, I can't stress that enough.  Even though its animated and put out by Disney and Pixar, it has very mature themes, which could be too dark for some children, but it is an amazing movie and it finishes the story of these wonderful characters beautifully.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|I have seen  several movie versions of this book. This version by far had the most beautiful sets and backgrounds. The acting was fine. The Baron was played as a real person and not a cartoon. However I felt the screenplay left a lot of the story out. You never really feel a connection to the characters. Plus there is a very silly scene where Anne runs for what seems like an hour. It was pointless and absurd. It would have been much better to have taken that screen time to let the actors act. I wouldn't recommend this version of 'Persuasion\\" when there are much better ones available.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|This dvd captures Iron Maiden in their prime, young and hungry. Not like a lot of music dvd's that were shot after a band was over the hill. As far as I know, this is the best Heavy Metal concert DVD out there. There are a few bands I like as much as Maiden, but none of them ever put out a video this powerful.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|So this is probably my favorite album as of now. The way Daft Punk composed the score, intertwining classical and electronic elements is wonderful. It surprised me that a group so deeply rooted in techno could pull of a classical score like this. It surprised me to know that they both wrote and performed it. For all I knew my first time through it could have been John Williams. Buy this album!
B000003TA4|5.0|The second and now legendary album by Nirvana came in 1991 as a breath of fresh air to prove that rock and roll was alive. From the opening chords and somewhat assymetrical riff on \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to soothing acoustics of \\"Something In The Way\\" the album is packed with ground-breaking songs that had an overpowering impact on a generation. The song-writing and musical talent of self-taught guitarist Kurt Cobain is just shining on the exemplary and soaring rock songs like the lead single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", compassionate \\"Come As You Are\\" and affecting \\"Lithium\\". Most of the songs use loud/quiet dynamics and combine shades of metal with shades of punk and pure pop melody that brings alternative rock to mainstream audience.   Cobain's writing style is somewhat twisted and cryptic with the disturbing theme of guns and death raised in many songs throughout the record. Whereas lyrics of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" sound more like a sequence of syllables to fill up the space, the occasional nonsense lyrics could not hide the captivating, revelatory side of his writing. The particular gems are \\"In Bloom\\", offering an attack on people who listen to certain music or wear in a certain style for the wrong reason, and \\"Lithium\\" - a devastating tale of a man who, after the death of his girlfriend, turns to religion as a last resort to keep himself alive. The emotional honesty about the way these songs are delivered by Cobain is another experience. As the entire record has a live recording feel about it with occasional (and possibly intentional) tape errors, you get to relate to emotions that are rooted so deeply only an untutored scream will do to express them. The fantastic thing about trademark structuring of Nirvana songs is that even when Cobain shifts into raw-throated fury, bassist Chris Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl still keep the song in control and away from musical chaos.   One may guess what the music industry would be like at the moment if it was notfor Cobain's untimely death in 1994. One thing that we know for sure is that Nevermind marked an important turning point in the history of music and produced life-changing impact few other bands could match.  -Sain Alizada
B001QWBM62|2.0|If you're goal in using the Zoom H4N is 4-channel mode with built in mics and external mics - pay heed, because when performed the Stereo Encode where it blends the two stereo files into one stereo file, and then played it back on my computer, here's what happened:  the final resulting stereo file as played back on my computer monitor speakers had an unacceptable clicking/popping noise in the right channel.  So, I repeated the same process again recording a new file in the same manner, and the same exact thing happened. I don't know if this means my unit was defective, or this will happen to all Zoom H4N's, but this is not acceptable, and poor audio quality, as far as I'm concerned.
B001DDBCUA|2.0|First of all, I loved this show; I still exercise to the reruns with a glass of wine and sparkling water daily.   I fully enjoyed the first film, finding it mostly true to the show and the characters.  However, this film is a letdown. It is almost an insult to the characters and the actresses. In fact Kim Cattrall should be angry; due to the writing and editing; Samantha becomes a over-sexed, pathetic, matron who doesn't seem to know herself any longer. She is in reality a beautiful woman and Samantha should have been allowed to show her growth and depth, which suited her previous character and experience. Carrie becomes a whining, foolish, almost (dare I say) annoying character. I wondered why 'Big' would stay interested. I can barely remember what Charlotte or Miranda did or did't do. The setting and plot are almost ridicules, and while beautiful scenically, the plot doesn't support any reality. It could have worked too; I could see pieces that worked.   That being said, I think the most offensive part was near the beginning; \\"the Gay wedding\\". I was embarrassed for every Gay person I know, and those I don't know. It was awful. Plus they made a mockery of the incredible Liza Minnelli by airing the scene of her signing and dancing to Beyonce's 'Put a rock on it...' I had to look away in shame. Soooooo inappropriate on so many levels! Actors cannot see themselves...the director should have caught that. I was deflated from there.  They owe us another, better film to wash the bad taste left by this one.
B000U55YIS|5.0|Baccara is at the Top of the Europop scene with this compilation which one could undoubtedly call the Utimate/Essential Collection, sung by the original artists.<br /><br />Even though, Baccara was very popular in the late 70's & early 80's, one often had the impression that their music has been disappearing over the years. That's why I was overjoyed when this cd publication was released, spanning their debut years in music, till recent times.<br /><br />The audio quality of these cds is excellent, which in itself has lended charm, in no small way, to the overall product.<br /><br />Let the unique voices of the Baccara Duo & their 'catchy', europop music give you an idea as to why the wonderful, magical music of the 70's & 80's will never die out.
030745455X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because I was constantly on the edge of my seat.  I especially loved how Larsson very artfully showed the difference in the perspectives of Blomkvist and Salander with the descriptions of the apartment.
B0047VEE0U|4.0|I received my collectors edition a day ago.     The Box  Like the other reviews state, I too found that my bottom two discs had fallen out of their slots and had been shaking around during shipping. There were some very light scratches but nothing major that has inhibited playback. The initial box I thought would be a little more impressive material-wise but its just another cardboard box that could smash in easily so I could keep it out of reach of children or danger areas if you want to keep it nice. The graphic image of the box is pretty impressive though and worthy of Display in any Harry Potter collection. I actually have on display on top of my desk for lack of anywhere else to put it and it actually looks rather nice up there. The slots in the box where the CDs are is not a good long term storage place. I would highly recommend getting other CD cases to store the CDs and the DVD long term. The slots neither hold the discs well nor protect the scratchable surface. Also, there is no track listing included. Just the inside jacket booklet as a cover. I would copy the tracks listed in the product review if you intend to get this. Overall the box is aesthetically pleasing but not protective    The CDd and DVD  I found playback perfect. The music is amazing and the purchase is definitely worth it because the music on the second disc that wasn't included in the movie is amazing and adds a whole new dynamic to the story! It truly is a pity this music wasn't used in the film. You will not be dissapointed with the music in the slightest! Gaurantted!     The DVD is neat. You get to listen to the entire first CD in 5.1 surround sound and includes an interview with Alexandre Desplat. Though, if that's the only reason you'd want to by this set, I wouldn't because there is only one interview and it sin't very long. You get a wonderful glimpse into the creation of the music but nothing really in depth. I really enjoyed it.     Sheet Music  Yes, turns out every one gets the same sheet music, mine is also \\"The Detonators\\" and the signature is electronic, though is real in that it is Alexandre Desplat's signature in red on the glossy paper. I don't mind this at all in the slightest and found this rather satisfactory. The glossy paper is sturdier and will last longer without fading. I even got my violin out and messed around with the notes that were there. It was fun. :)     The Vinyl Disc  I think this is rather neat! I used to play vinyl when I was a kid but I no longer have a player so I don't know if it actually plays or if its for show (nor did I read enough of the reviews to find out). Either way, aesthetically or functionally I found this addition rather neat and am glad it was included!    The Poster  Whether or not no one has ever seen it I can't tell because I don't remember all the posters available but it is rather neat. Its not a big wall poster by any means but a smaller landscape poster. I don't mind at all. A poster is to be expected with any collector's item, at least for me, and like the one I received and have no complaints.     Film Cells  I definitely think this is VERY worth the purchase. How unique the cells are I'm unsure but the fact I have films cells is neat in its own right. I don't think I could succeed in trying to obtain films cells on my own with out this purchase. I did the same thing with Titanic, got the collectors edition and haven't regretted spending the extra money on either. My films cells are of Harry and Voldemort facing each other when Harry comes to die, which is obviously in part 2 of the movie.    Overall  I feel this a worthy purchase for the music and Harry Potter enthusiast. If you aren't as into it as to appreciate the simple fact of begin the owner of films cells, the vinyl disc, the copied sheet music, and fancy box, etc. and are only interested in the music, I would suggest just buying the soundtrack itself. I am happy with what I've received as i love music and anything extra I can get is well worth the trouble to get it. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars and rather 4 is for the reason the CDs weren't protected, the box itself isn't long term protection worthy,  nor was the simple and basic fact of a track listing included. I would suggest to Warner Brothers to improve that particular area with the next collector's edition. All in all, perfect for the collector of music and Harry Potter. :)

B00406UK7S|4.0|I watched Centurion last night. It's Neil Marshall's take on the mystery of the Roman 9th Legion, which mysteriously disappeared in Scotland sometime around 117 A.D. Wow.!<br /><br />  I'm not sure how historically accurate any of it is, but the movie is a great time. It's bloody and action packed and never really slows down until literally the very last minute. The acting was better than usual in action movies. Dominic West as The Roman General Titus Flavius Virilus was fantastic, he was just the kind of commander you'd want to serve under and I felt he out-Spartan'ed Gerard Jones from 300. Michael Fassbender was good as the thoughtful Centurion Quintus Dias and Imogene Poot did a nice job as the \\"witch\\" Arianne. She put a nice spin on the character, making her more of an outcast than a menace. The scenery is also amazing. I never knew Scotland was so beautiful or even that it has mountains.<br /><br />  But the breakaway star of this movie, hands down, was Olga Kurylenko as Etain, the Pictish scout who hunts Romans. She is quite the Terminator in this movie; she is so overwhelmingly powerful that she almost seems like a force of nature. But her performance isn't all one note. Etain has a good reason to feel and act the way she does. She and her family were horribly brutalized by the Romans and now, as one character put it, \\"she has an empty hole in her soul that only Roman blood can fill.\\"  She does have a final showdown with Fassbender's character, Quintus Dias, and although I don't want to give anything away..............SPOILER........SPOILER..................SPOILER.................................. .....SPOILER...when Quintus eventually kills her she seems both furious at being killed and relieved  that she no longer has to feel the pain of her loss. Maybe I'm getting a little hokey there, perhaps even ferklempt, but I think she gave a great performance, especially with a character who is mute and can only convey her feelings through her eyes and body language.<br /><br />  I had a blast watching this movie. I wasn't expecting a Smithsonian documentary on a historical event, I was looking for a fun and exciting movie experience and in that vein Centurion delivers.a blast watching this movie.

B000002GJ7|4.0|Like millions of other people, I bought this album just for the one Hit, \\"More Than Words\\" which is one of the most beautiful recordings and at the same time one of the most confusing songs. I Mean, what is he really saying? It doesn't matter, the song is Excellent. This album is really a heavy metal album mostly; but some of the best Heavey Metal you'll ever hear.  Extreme never takes the easy way out; there are no Three Chord Head Bangers here. They always throw a curve ball or some kind of change up.  The lyrics are intelligent, well thought out.  The musicianship is the best I've ever heard from a Heavey Metal band.  I don't even Like Heavey Metal all that much, but I'm learning to like this album. There are a couple of other little Gems Like \\"When I first kissed you\\", a mellow jazzy piano ballad; and \\"Whole Hearted\\" which kind of reminds me of Supertramp. Also \\"Song for Love\\" is a very good heavey ballad.    The rest of the album are all fast, heavey songs.     I believe that their eclectic song writing was a blessing a curse.  A blessing to be able to write so many different Genres of music so well.  A curse in that no one knew what to make of them,  The Head Bangers types wouldn't like the mellow songs, the People who loved \\"More than Words \\" probably didn't care for the heavey stuff.  All I can say is; this band deserved a better fate, they were mostly forgotten after this album. Like I said; I am grwoing fond of the whole album, every song, the more I listen to it; but it is a mixed bag.

031603438X|2.0|'Life' by Keith Richards-(I admit that I skip around some here, but if I had written the review I wanted to it would have been pages long.)<br /><br />  If I had written this review when had I just gotten past his horrible treatment of Brian Jones, stealing his  girlfriend and then tossing him out of the band that he, Brian, put together it would have been a complete slash job. Even now, after slogging through 500 & some odd pages I have to say that Mr. Richards sounds like, at best, a nerdy spoiled twit who got lucky and at worst a man so consumed by fame that he truly believes that he is world class guitar player and the best thing to come along since sliced bread, but it just doesn't hold up.<br /><br /> There are constant inconsistancies and contradictions. On one hand while on tour all Mick and Keith do is belittle and make fun of Brain who, even Keith wrote was an insecure man. Nice way to build his confidence, what a guy.Then he goes on to say that they had some time off and it was only natural to visit Brian and I have to ask,why? By his own admission he hated Brian, the only thing he liked about him was Anita. Persoanlly I think both Keith and Mick were threatened by his musical prowess and wanted him kept in his place until they could get rid of him.He doesn't get into how they decided to toss him, which was to tell him that because of his drug bust he couldn't tour and  he goes on & on about what bad shape Brian was in, so why didn't he try and help? Putz.<br /> So, he was out. But what about Keith's busts, espcially in Toronto, he had *everyone* behind him, including Mick-what did they do for Brian, nothng and for that alone I think of him as a very small man-in every way.He doesn't even acknowledge that it was his celebrity that kept him out of jail when the average guy would have done 3 to 5 or more for the charges he had around his neck and later calls himself a felon, not apologizing, but again, bragging. With all that bragging it's a good thing he didn't go to jail, I doubt he would have survived.<br /><br />IMHO they havn't done an album that was worth listening to all the way through since \\"Some Girls\\". They are a circus playing their old hits and throwing in some new crap that no one really wants to hear.I ask you, what grown men give themselves a nick name? 'The Glimmer Twins' It's perfect for them now because all that is left is a glimmer of their former glory. Maybe it's time for them to hang up the open mouth/lapping tounge.<br /><br />As Keith said himself,\\"How can I stop when I've started\\" 'Well you just stop' \\" and they should.<br /><br />He did have some truthful things to say about quitting dope.You do feel like you are steping out of some elite cool status. It is hard to step back into society and I give him big points for doing this and doing it well. I know it isn't easy.<br /><br />Still, all things taken into account, gun, knives, chasing a kid through his daughters wedding-he has painted a portrait of man who is in many ways like Narcissus, drowning in his own reflection. I suppose it could be seen as a ommentary of what fame did to a man that Lady Luck should have passed over.I doubt he would have survived.

0596805888|5.0|OK, this book is just plain fun. The recipes are straight-forward and tasty, and it's terrific to dive deep in to how and why food transforms itself during the cooking process.    Potter covers everything from Calibrating Your Instruments to creating your own sous vide immersion cooker. Along the way you'll learn about how leaveners work, discover a new taste factor you may not have known of (Umami), figure out some key time/temperature figures critical to food safety, and get exposed to some interesting molecular gastronomy.    The writing style is exceedingly well-done. Potter does a great job walking readers through the recipes and the science behind them - and it's extremely apparent that he's writing about something he loves.    I'm a very serious, very accomplished home cook and I got a tremendous amount out of this book. More importantly, I had scads of fun reading it.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Still showing his technical prowess, this pressing really links Joe to his rock roots.  It is a bit more raw than some of his other studio work, not as much production.  The songs are, as always with Joe, well thought out compositions with a real human feel to them.  Joe is a master at having his guitar speak for him.  Listening to these songs you feel a story is being told to you, not that someone is demonstrating how to play guitar.  Joe's mastery of the instrument allows him to talk to you that much better.  A true master.  It is hard to pick Joe's best album, but I would put this among my favorites.

0385738757|5.0|After reading Maze Runner, I wasn't sure how author, James Dashner, would be able to keep the story alive. Often the second book in a trilogy or series is the weakest. When I started Scorch Trials, I was expecting this pattern to hold.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Thomas and the Gladers show us once again what the human race is capable of - both survival and cruelty.<br /><br />After being \\"rescued\\" from the Maze, Thomas and his companions soon learn that the earth has been burned by sun flares. A psychological sickness creeps into the minds of those infected and turns them into lunatics called Cranks. They discover their test is not over, their new \\"maze\\" (aka trial) is to navigate across the Scorch - a burned stretch of earth spanning miles and miles, and get an antidote for the disease.<br /><br />And Teresa? Oh, she's there too. But the reader has a very difficult time deciding which side she is on.<br /><br />Scorch Trials has more twists and turns than the maze. A few new characters are thrown in, and we get to see Thomas in a new, conflicted light.<br /><br />I am pleased to say Scorch Trials was every bit as strong, interesting and intriguing as the Maze Runner.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|The first part of this series was so convoluted, it had no focus and seemed to just be all over the place. But then something great happened, it started to find it's footing and became interesting and entertaining. As always, I'm loving the honest character and that's Damon. Makes no pretenses for what he is and I love that about him.<br /><br />I do find Elena and Stephan to be a boring couple. Elena is boring anyway and Stephan is your typical brooding vampire who's trying to be the good guy so the wholesome girl could love him. What I find entertaining about Stephan, what I think saves him from being your standard typical is that he doesn't interfere with Damon that much and when it's time to work together, he does without too much judgment. You see more of that in season two and that's what makes his character not be a pain in the neck.<br /><br />It's good to see a vampire series that still has kick butt villains, cause Isobel and Katherine are so much fun. Especially Isobel!

006112429X|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. It isn't particularly believable, but it's fiction. It's a scary sad story about a bunch of messed up people that seem to take everything to the extreme. I'm surprised so many people seem to empathize with Eva, for the most part I thought she was still trying to justify herself to Franklin, even though she claimed to be completely honest and forthcoming with a few secrets throughout the letters. Perhaps the author was trying to convey that not much had really changed. Throughout the whole book, I found myself just wishing she'd quit being so stubborn and give poor Kevin a chance. I do not buy that he was a bad egg for a second, and I don't think that's what the author was trying to convey either.     SPOILER: Kevin is a slightly morbid child, but he doesn't really do anything that bad until the teenage years. Yeah he possibly told a little girl to scratch her eczema at 6, or squirted ink all over his moms maps, but really? None of that seemed all that scary to me, certainly not enough to earn so much scorn from his mother. It seemed like things that normal children do, like ripping wings off an insect, and instead of sitting him down and talking to him about why it was wrong, dad swoops in and says it's \\"normal\\" and drops it, and mom seems to prefer to say nothing and let it justify her apathy toward her own child. I believed he had the issues with potty training for so long because he possibly just wanted to be close to his mother, if not anger her at the same time. By the end of the book it's apparent that Eva has misjudged him more than once, from not believing him about the overpass incident to the stolen photograph she thought he just tore to shreds. Kevin loved her very dearly, but his being a difficult baby drove her to completely shut him out and play the victim, leading him to commit the ultimate atrocity as a means to get her attention, and possibly take the only things she loves away so he is all there is left.     You can see he cares for her when she finds his computer virus collection. He shows his protective side by saying if she has a problem with anyone to let him know. She took an interest in who he was, and he responded positively, then she makes some smart ass remark about \\"bonding\\" and walks out.     While I did anticipate the ending, I still found it heartbreaking. Kevin's whole life was spent trying not to let on just how much he really wanted his mothers love, just as his mother was trying so hard not to let on that there was no love to be had.     I think a lot of readers have a hard time accepting that the narrator is not always credible, but that's what I loved so much about this book. It is written rather pretentiously, but considering just how self important Eva is, I would completely believe that this is how she would write a letter to anyone, fully explaining to the reader--and herself--exactly what happened, because how she see's it is how it *really* is, as far as she is concerned.     Like I said, the story isn't believable, which puts a lot of readers off, but if I wanted to read something believable I'd read nonfiction. I highly recommend this book!

The extras went a long way to answering this question.    Really glad I got the disc and to see quality work again.
030746363X|5.0|I have followed Tim's writing for a few years. Not exactly a fanboy, but I use what is useful, and he does have a lot of interesting things he discovers in his OCD travels (learned an easy way to hard-boil and peel eggs just yesterday from an old video of his).<br /><br />I liked that the book was essentially a collection of a good deal of existing information about health and fitness. Some of it, I had not heard before, or hadn't explored. Other subjects are his take on more mainstream-ish things like diets.<br /><br />I was surprised he was as kind to vegetarians as he was, as I went into the read expecting a bunch of \\"Meat good!\\" commentary. He does give a very good analysis of the different schools of thought on food and nutrition. With so many different \\"best way\\" to eat styles out there, I think this was very well-done.<br /><br />Some of the subjects covered come with their own warning, and though he covers them, even the author does not recommend them. Some are included just for the story and research.<br /><br />Taking my absorb what is useful approach fits well with this book, as he starts it off by saying it's much like others have described as a \\"choose your own adventure\\" kind of book, suggesting you skip to sections that apply to tasks you are trying to achieve, such as weight loss, muscle mass gain, or a pure strength focus.<br /><br />I read the book all the way through, taking notes on parts that interested me or that I wanted to do further research on. There is a good deal of value in there. Much can be found elsewhere (as with every other source), but it's written well, laid out in an easy to sort fashion, and is worth a read/study.

1936594293|3.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin<br /><br /> Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin was first published in 1813 by T. Egerton, Whitehall, and is a classic tale of love, hate, and heartbreak. Its realistic fiction genre makes this 360 (or so) page story able to relate to today. You can imagine some of the emotions throughout and although there are no illustrations, you can use your own mind to picture the story. The tale takes us on turns and elaborates on the drama in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, and their romances with the men in the book. Jane Austin, who is a widely recognized author today, was not recognized much during her lifetime. She was born in 1775 and unfortunately passed away 1817 because of an illness. In that time she wrote many books, one being Pride and Prejudice. Her family was compassionate of her writings and took it into their own hands to try to get them published. Only a few managed to get published, however. During the 20th century Pride and Prejudice, and many of Austin's other works, finally became recognized and were seen as great novels by many readers. They were published and became best sellers among many companies. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most read books today by adolescents and adults of many ages. Many people enjoy this roller coaster tale and it's occasionally comical characters.<br /><br /> The characters in Pride and Prejudice have very distinct personalities, which contribute to the ups and downs of the story. However, to truly understand the customs of the four main characters in this book, you must put yourself in the beginning of 1800's, during the Napoleonic Wars (1797-1815), in the town of Hertfordshire. The setting explains the way in which the characters act. The characters personalities make for many moods; including love, hate, passion, loss, and urgency. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet and she is also the narrator of the story. She is the second eldest of the Bennet daughters and her smart,quick wit sometimes makes her perceive people too quickly. Elizabeth occasionally fails to dig deep into a person's true story and she keeps her guard up at first impressions. Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters and is known to be the most beautiful. She is pressured throughout the story to marry soon because of her age and her relationship with Mr. Bingley shapes the book. Mr. Charles Bingley is a young man of wealth and looks, who comes to Hertfordshire. He owns the Netherfield estate and when he meets Jane he falls in love with her. The last main character is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He owns the Pemberly estate and is seen throughout the story as a proud, judgmental man. Towards the end of the book these portrayals change and we find out Mr. Darcy's true character. Some other side characters include: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the other Bennet daughters, Mr. Darcy's sister, Mr. Bingley's sister, Mrs. De Bourgh, and Mr. Wickham. All the characters have elements that are special to their part in the book. They are all unique.<br /><br /> The beginning of this love story starts out with the arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley, in the town of Longbourn. He moves into the Netherfield estate accompanied by his sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. The Bennets, another family of Longbourn, hear this news and they set their hopes high that Mr. Charles Bingley will marry one of their daughters. Throughout the first few chapters, we see how attached Mr. Bingley becomes to Jane, who is the eldest of the Bennet daughters, and that Mr. Darcy, too, shows a strange attitude towards Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Bennet daughters. In the middle, the conflicts arise that shape the ending of the book. The Bingley residence surprisingly moves away to London and Jane is heartbroken. Elizabeth goes to visit her friend there, that summer, and although she does not see Mr. Bingley, she does have a few interactions with Mr. Darcy. Darcy's stubborn,selfish behavior unfolds at these points and we learn that he is actually in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth does not feel equal love towards him because of her own stubbornness and failure to look at a person's true identity. Towards the end of the book, Elizabeth realizes how blind she had been about Mr. Darcy and begins to love him back, realizing that they are actually very similar in character. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come back to Longbourn and Mr. Bingley confesses that he still loves Jane. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth reunite confessing their love as well. The rise and fall of the different emotions in the plot make for many exciting climaxes.<br /><br /> Sometimes the difference between what your heart feels and what your brain thinks can make things confusing. That is what happens in Pride and Prejudice. A good theme for the book would be that you shouldn't judge a person or come to assumptions about them until you know their real story. Poor Elizabeth feels a roller coaster of emotions towards Mr. Darcy throughout the book, from love to hate, then back to love. She just doesn't understand why he acts the way he does. He's confusing to her. He acts as though he is very proud of himself in the beginning and he is not very kind to people who he doesn't know. Later he warms up to Elizabeth; however it may be a little late for him, since she has already established her feelings towards him. The turning point of the story, when we really see how the theme fits, is when Elizabeth goes to Pemberly while the thinks Mr. Darcy is away. She realizes that her feelings have changed because she knows his real story. She read Mr. Darcy's letter, which explained a lot, and she knows then why he acts the way he does. It begins to make sense to her. What Elizabeth originally thought about Mr. Darcy was all different now. She just needed to know the real him. The theme really makes for an exciting realization at the turning point of Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br /> Have you everbeen on a kiddie roller coaster, that had its ups and downs but those hills were really not exciting? That's how I felt about this book. It was slow moving at times and it never had an enormous climax. Rather, it had a few small ones, which were very predictable. While reading the book, I discovered that I felt as though Pride and Prejudice had a little too much description and narration, instead of dialogue. The lack of dialogue made it difficult to truly feel the characters emotions. I had a hard time putting myself in the characters shoes. The love story was not portrayed as very romantic because the characters never really connected on that level. Overall, I did not care for the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin.

B003Y58CKS|3.0|Since I bought this DVD on the strength of the reviews given here, I feel obliged to register a dissenting opinion.  Florez & Damrau are glorious to listen to, but overall I found the acting stilted & the production to work against the emotion of the music.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I'VE ENJOYED THIS MOVIE ON BOTH DVD AND BLU-RAY. IT'S SIMPLY A GREAT MOVIE!!!!  I COULD PROBABLY WATCH THIS MOVIE TWICE A WEEK. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!  HERB.
B002ZG980U|1.0|This is one of those movies where the writer was on some sort of drugs when he wrote the movie.  I don't know what kind of complicated mind can come up with this.  It was so hard to follow, that my best option was to fall a sleep myself in the hopes that I can have a better dream. I cant believe the reviews it got from the experts.  I had very low expectations of the movie going to the theater, and it met all of my expectations.  A dream, within a dream, within a dream, within that dream.  Hopefully go got all that, because that is what you will be facing.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|ODESSA IS A BEAUTIFUL CD. THE FIRST CD WAS IN STEREO AND WAS FANTASTIC, THE SONGS WERE VERY DEFINED LIKE A STORY. THE SECOND CD WAS IN MONO AND WAS GREAT TOO. THE THIRD CD WAS A BONUS WITH UNREALEASED MATERIAL ON SOME OF THE SONGS. I AM A BEATLES FAN AND LOVE SGT. PEPPER,S AND IN MY PERSONAL OPINON ODESSA IS BETTER THEN SGT PEPPER,S.THIS CD SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE NOTICED. THIS 2 CD SET IS THE BEST THE BEE GEES EVER PRODUCED. THE PACKAGING IS SUPERB. THE OUT SIDE OF THE BOX IS RED VELVET. BOOKLET INSIDE WITH INFORMATION ON THE ALBUM. THE PRICE IS WHY I GOT IT.., MY RATING ON THIS BEAUTIFUL CD IS 5 STARS.
030746363X|5.0|As a 145 lbs. 22-year old male, I figured the first and best thing to test in the ocean of body recomposition strategies in the 4HB would be rapid fat loss. I'm one of those people who can eat anything, anytime and not gain weight, but the reverse is also true. In the last four years, during college, my weight remained strictly between 140 and 145lbs despite on-and off exercise routines that ranged from no exercise for a whole semester to a whole summer of working out 6 days a week. A month after starting the Slow-Carb diet detailed in the book, I've already lost 6 lbs and am at the lowest weight I've been since mid-high school! Can't wait to see what else I can do with the material in this book, and it's something I'll be experimenting with for at least the next 2-3 years.

B003J7HOF0|5.0|Parkway Drive's Deep Blue is incredible to me and I don't normally listen to this type of music. I don't think I've ever heard any album more beautiful and brutal all at once (and yes I've heard their other releases). For me, Deep Blue stands on top of Killing With a Smile and Horizons. This album must be special to be able to pull in someone who can't stand listening to most the bands out there in this genre. The only other metalcore band I've heard that I've enjoyed is Misery Signals and I don't know if they can even come close to creating something as beautiful and powerful as Deep Blue. If this was my main listening genre, I'd be kissing Parkway Drives ass for releasing something so much better than any other band in this genre not low balling them because it wasn't exactly what I wanted. 5 stars all the way for me!
B0038P9LTU|4.0|This album is pretty much the exact same as all the others. Yes, itfs quite epic. Yes, metalfs favorite octogenarian, Christopher Lee, provides narration. Yes, the performances are amazing. Yes, Fabio still has a tenuous grasp on the English language.    However, somethingfs missing. This is not one of my go-to CDs when I want some Rhapsody (of Fire). Give me some Dawn of Victory! Yeah! On the other hand, itfs definitely more memorable than 2006s Triumph or Agony; the only thing I can remember from that album off the top of my head is Christopher Lee saying gblackc geometry!h    This disc is a solid effort by these power metal veterans. If you didnft hate Triumph or Agony, then pick up The Frozen Tears of Angels.    (Originally written by me for SteelResolve.com)
0307592839|5.0|This is a different type of story, not a traditional novel more than a series of short stories, centered on a group of characters loosely connected to the music business. Their lives are played out over time, not necessarily in linear order and we are treated to viewing the effects of the passage of time - the goon - on their lives, values and relationships.<br /><br />The story is told over a 50 year time span that begins in the San Francisco punk rock scene in the 1970s and ends in a slightly dystopian future in 2020. We meet Bennie when he is a teenage musician in SF, then in his prime as a successful music producer, see him again when he is a washed up 40 year old trying to connect with his young son and finally as a 70 something having one last hurrah producing a show starring his teenage band mate Scotty.<br /><br />Sasha the other main character has worked as Bennie's assistant. We  meet her as a 30 year old with psychological issues that include kleptomania, then learn her back-story as a child of a violent relationship, see her in Naples as a lost teenager, then as a college student trying to talk her best friend out of suicide, and finally as middle aged mom with two young children.<br /><br />Egan introduces other memorable characters, giving them their own chapters and then polishing their stories with short references  in other chapters. The characters are the strength of this story and they are memorable. Lou, the successful record producer who does cocaine and chases teenage girls around SF. Dolly the PR executive who loses her business after a devastating fire and returns to rehabilitate the image of a genocidal African dictator. Ted, Sasha's uncle caught in a loveless marriage who travels to Naples ostensibly to find her but is obsessed with the art there. Jules, Bennie's brother-in-law, a journalist who during an interview with a starlet inexplicitly attacks her, goes to prison for his crime, rehabilitates and ends up writing stories about Bennie's washed up prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Egan uses modern technology to tell her story, including a PowerPoint presentation from Sasha's daughter and texting.<br /><br />This plot summary makes this story sound disjointed and one dimensional and the book is anything but that. Her prose is simple and well structured, a pleasure to read. These characters walk off the page into your mind if not exactly into your heart. For those of us who read and love characters this book is a treasure. Told in an unconventional way Egan has a talent for developing characters that are deeply and fully realized. The overarching theme of the novel, the effects of time on people, relationships and values is captured wonderfully.  While none of the characters are particularly inspiring and most come to unremarkable ends, the brilliant prose prevents this story from being depressing.<br /><br />I listened to this novel on audio CDs and I was worried that I would not be able to flip back and reread a section to keep everyone straight in this complex story but that wasn't the case, it really flowed well. The story was read by the talented Roxena Ortega. She was able to differentiate these characters well and reliably reproduce their voices over all of the chapters. I believe this book would be just as enjoyable read as listened to.Egan uses modern technology to tell her story, including a PowerPoint presentation from Sasha's daughter and texting.

4770031246|5.0|I have always been a fan of justbento.com and was estatic that she had decided to write a book dedicated to bentos. At first, when I received the book, I was worried that it might be too simple or redundant or complicated. I shouldn't have. Makiko Itoh's dedication to detail is like no other. She not only tells you how to make a dish, she explains why something is done a certian way, what happens if you freeze the products, and alternate recipes. The bentos are gorgeous and varied but are still healthy and quick to make. Instead of being frilly or over decorative, she demonstrates how just a little tweaking can make your bento beautiful. Very practical and good for beginnning chefs as well as mothers. My only wish was that there were more recipes!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Nice.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If this movie doesn't move you to tears I will be very surprised. Very well done, such a heartfelt story based on true events. Love the fact they show the real people and dog at the end of the movie. Have watched it 3 times already.

B000002L68|5.0|Warner Bros. Records, the company that has screwed many artists in their lifetime and possibly even wrecked careers, STILL has NOT REMASTERED THIS ALBUM on CD!! The only \\"consolation prize\\" available is some crappy VINYL re-issue, overpriced and overhyped. The invention of the compact disc as well as improvements made since the 1980's DEMANDS that this album be re-issued in an extended digital format. It took them decades to remaster The Cure, and it will probably take longer to do the same for Prince. It's a pity as I hate LPs. I have a few of them, but the Bull-manure about vinyl being \\"warmer\\" and \\"truer\\" tot he artist's original intentions is the same as saying silent films should never be remade with sound or in color for audiences 30 years in the future. ALBUMS ARE RECORDED WITH THE BEST AUDIO TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME, but unfortunately, the process of cutting a master and then transferring the grooves over and over to mother and stampers as well as wear on the stamper, will inevitably yield an inferior final product compared to the original master cut on the lathe, and even worse compared to the master tapes, as lathes can only transfer a limited range of frequencies, so even if you had a pristine first generation stamped LP, the sound would not match the dynamic range of the original master tapes. It's like hearing AM radio all your life and believing this is what real music sounds like. So while I love the music and greatly admire Prince, the current CD edition is a piece of crap, the CD mastering done on inferior primitive equipment, obsolete by today's standards, and the LP edition is just another way to fleece the fans of their money - twenty five dollars for an LP???  Japanese editions, even with the Mini-LP format sound exactly like the US editions. Some recent personal examples: Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Smiths and David Bowie CDs I bought. I hope that maybe by 2013, the 30th anniversary of this album, WB will be generous enough to give it the respect it deserves!
0316067938|5.0|I so enjoy reading and this was a book I couldn't put down.  I read it in 2 1/2 days.  I can't wait to read the other books in this series.
044654759X|5.0|This was one of the best N. Sparks books I have read! It has the traditional beautifully written love story theme, romantic and witty BUT also adds an element of suspense and thrill! Very exciting, took a little bit to pick up but once it did, it really did! My heart was literally racing at times, very exciting story.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book has it all - mystery, romance, secrets and lies.  And lots and lots of action.  Lisbeth Salander is my new favorite anti-hero.

B001E5FYS8|2.0|I don't get it. The movie is good but not anywhere near great. It is really about some obviously rich kids with nothing better to do than pull a stunt that probably cost NYC millions as the traffic and police needed to clear below this stunt were used. The stunt is made out to be incredibly dangerous but in truth Petit crossed back and forth 8 times, laid down, waved to people, etc. I admit anything done from that height is dangerous but his apparent ability to go back and forth so many times shows it was not nearly the incredible feat the movie tries to make. I say rich kids because no working person would have had the time and money to do this nonsense. Petit and friends spent months planning, meeting, practicing, buying thousands of dollars of cable and equipment. No working person could spare the time or money. I believe Petit and crew could have put the money and talents to better use.  The movie makes this out to be a sort of event of a lifetime. Well, I was alive and in my 20's in 1974 and this was nothing more than a blurb on the nightly news and an event I just vaguely remember. The walk on the moon, Woodstock, the Jets winning the Super Bowl,and so many other events around that time were so much more burned into memory.  I felt cheated and duped. I was expecting as one reviewer said, \\"a heart pounding thriller\\". Hardly. A well planned circus stunt? Yes. Some rich kids having fun while thousands of people below were stopped from getting to work, doing their jobs and a total disruption of the city is not something to be idolized over.  The movie is at best a 3 star movie. Well done but in the end not satisfying, inspiring or worth having spent my 90 minutes. If you want to see some really great movies that did not get much attention go to Hardtofindmusicandmovies.com and see the list of \\"100 Greatest Movies You Have Never Seen\\" and you will find some really worthwhile movies.
B000SFD21Q|3.0|Compared to the China Study, this book is marginal. He could have reduced this book to half the pages. But I learned a great deal, and confirmed that my exercise program is proper. The parts about stress, depression, and ADHD were of little interest to me. There were 100s of words that were meaningless to me. This book seemed to be written to his graduate students at Harvard, or a peer group of his fellow doctors. Glad I read it, but would not recommend it to many people that are not in the field.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|Predictable bone-head (potentially life threatening) moves by male journalist throughout book. It made the heroine look bad for having a relationship with him. The book should be on the Â«freeÂ» list.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I waited specifically to see if Amazon had it cheaper than the store and it was a good 76% difference. I really liked this movie. It was great knowing that the movie came in the condition described and coming from somewhere in the US. Movie plays as if it was new. No problems, and arrived quickly.
1594488843|4.0|I enjoyed reading Drive.  As a marketing consultant, I often read books on motivation and persuasion so I thought that Drive would be a good fit for my interests. Unfortunately, Drive is about how to motivate people in the work place, so more applicable to managers.<br /><br />It was interesting to read the case studies of the companies that have taken significant steps towards providing their employees autonomy in the work place, and how successful they have been. If I were managing employees, I would definitely consider testing something similar in my department.<br /><br />In sum, an interesting book, but for marketers looking for insights on how to motivate people the Robert Cialdini books are better.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Even though this album does not contain all of the music from Tron Legacy, the music it does have is awesome.  It is one of my favourite movie soundtracks of all time.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|First to the people who marked this a 1 star must not watch a lot of movies    The Town was great one of the best movies in a while.. Most just score on the fact they can't stand Ben Affleck I for one am not the biggest fan in the world. He changed that with this movie.. I won't give anything away so trust me as a movie lover  watch it.....................One note there is a lot of Language...............
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I don't know how, but Rick Riordan has struck again.  Fantastic book for anyone who enjoyed the Percy Jackson series.  Buy it!  Read it!  Love it!
1423101499|5.0|This novel had all of the great features for a good story.  It has interesting and well developed characters, a great plot, great writing, and a bit of humor.      This volume finds Percy delving into the Labyrinth with Annabeth, Rachel Dare, Grover, and Tyson in a search for Daedalus's workshop.  There are new gods to meet, new challenges to overcome, and new enemies to defeat.  This book had more action and more interesting twists and turns than the previous books.  It sets everything up nicely for the final book which will hopefully detail the final titanic battle.    If you're looking for a book series for your child to read, I recommend this series.  Through four books, there is no excessive violence, no foul language, and no inappropriate situations between the characters.  These are thoroughly enjoyable by kids and their parents.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Some would say that this movie has no 'soul,' and they would be absolutely correct. That is the point.<br /><br />It begs the questions; What is Art? How far should Art go? What is the point of Art?<br /><br />Speaking for myself, I consider Art an essential reaction to Life, and a method of pushing emotions into others; Art is something that makes you feel things that you probably and sometimes hopefully, wouldn't feel on your own. The critical side in the questioning of how far it should go fall on mostly deaf ears, here; I believe Art should have no limits, and should only cater to an audience so-much, if at all. The point of Art is easy for me; the point is to move the Artists to make it, and secondly the audience who receive it.<br /><br />This movie is about how things have the ability to take humans over and hollow them out; drugs are the main carrier of the disease here, but the audience should be able to surmise that it's really speaking about all the things we lose ourselves in, to the point where we can't find out way back out. The obsessive, compulsive, worldly manipulations that crush so many lives, are the star of this show. It's a brutal, propulsive, assaultive movie that keeps the heat on until the end, and leaves you feeling like the characters must have; entirely empty. The point is to get there, to that point, carried by the loss of soul and light the characters experience.<br /><br />This movie is supposed to stay with you. It's supposed to haunt you. It's supposed to remind you next time you pick up that cigarette, to question if you're still in control of yourself; or those diet pills, of that six pack of beer, or that gambling habit you might have picked up. The point of this movie is to break into you, and show you exactly how easy it is to lose sight of who you are, where you're from and where you had planned to go; it's a stunning work of genius that's designed to shake you up in an extreme way and make you think about your life, and your dreams. It brings with it questions; who your friends are and if they're worth keeping around, for one. The film forces us, also, to examine our self worth; it makes us take stock of our lives and think of ways to make adjustments.<br /><br />I've only watched this movie twice. The first time was more than ten years ago, and the second time was a couple years ago. I plan to watch it again, but it's hard. This movie is a very upsetting movie; make no illusions about that. I find it incredibly hard to watch, at times, and think it takes me to the outer edges of my sanity by the end.<br /><br />The first few hours after watching the movie for the first time, I remember very well. I was pretty stunned, with where the movie had taken me, in such a relatively short period of time, but what seemed like an eternity. I felt so empty, bone dry, hollowed out. I didn't cry for a week after seeing this movie, for any reason; it took the ability out of me, and I've heard others say similar things regarding the film's effect on them. The days following, I thought a great deal about the movie and my life.<br /><br />If you are mentally unstable, or easily influenced, you shouldn't watch this movie. It's not for you. It just isn't.<br /><br />Having said all that, I don't think I would recommend this movie to my entire Christmas list. It's easily misunderstood, and if you go into it expecting a movie for entertainment-only purposes, you'll hate it.ions; who your friends are and if they're worth keeping around, for one.

0689865384|4.0|So, it doesn't really compare to the Hunger Games but I was surprised by how engrossed I became in this book.  It does start out a little slow, but once Tally leaves the city it gets pretty good.  I'm reading the second one now and so far I like it even more than the first, so its definetly worth checking out.
159448385X|4.0|I liked this book, however, I do feel that Khaled Hosseini should stick to writing from the point of view of male characters. I couldn`t identify with the women in this book because I didn`t feel that they were all that realistic, and both the male and female characters were very one-dimensional. Rasheed was an almost cartoonish villain at times. The story itself is relentlessly depressing, but it kept me turning pages and somehow I still enjoyed it. Stay away from it if you`re looking for anything even remotely cheerful, but it`s worth a read if you`re not.
0439023521|5.0|It's been several months since I finished this book, but each time it catches my eye on the shelf I'm immediately pulled back into the suspense and drama that this book unleashed.  This book is not for the faint of heart, as the action and story are brutally realistic.  It's not gory by any means, but try not to get too attached to any of the characters, because the story centers on a fight to the death between 24 teen-aged combatants.  When you start to read this make sure you have plenty of time available, because you will not want to put it down.      Without a doubt, this is one of the most suspenseful books I've ever read.  It's unpredictable, and you will have no idea how it is going to end until you finish.  Even writing this review I can feel my muscles tensing as I'm drawn back into this world.  I have to stop typing now, because I fear another contestant might hear me.

B001NLKT60|1.0|I don't get it. All this writer's book need a good editor, but since the characters are not interesting and there seem to be millions of them, all with similar names, I really don't know if that would help much.<br /><br />Seriously, not so good.
1853261580|5.0|This is much better than the new graphic version. This translation is close to the old copy that I have from many years ago; just updated a little. It's a beautiful story for both children and adults. It's one of my all time favorite books. It's a must have for your children. They will re-read it at different times in their lives and love it even more.
0142000655|5.0|East of Eden is a positively wonderful book.  Steinbeck's literary ability & style is phenomenal.  One of the very best writers of several of the best books I've ever read.  I recommend \\"East Of Eden\\" to everybody!  And you'll want to read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" too!!!

B0037KMHRY|5.0|I really enjoyed this sound track for it brings fond memories when I was a teenager during the 80s and I had seen the original Tron movie the theaters and played the video game often.<br />I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoys nice electronic sound that is soothing and energizing.

0385341679|4.0|It took me a lot longer to finish this book than I expected, partly because it was almost 600 pages long, partly due to outside distraction, and partly due to it's content. Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome book. But it's a very psychological book in terms of plot and theme. It was honestly a little exhausting, and at times a little dull.<br /><br />It isn't possible to describe the plot without spoilers, but I'll try to at least not give away the big mysteries. We rejoin Mac where the last book left off; she's trapped in the Silvers, she's just killed someone, and she's flipping out. The \\"death\\" of this \\"person\\" leads her to join forces with Darroc, the notorious villain of the previous books. At this point in the story (and throughout most of the book) Mac is a little crazy. She's having an identity crisis in spades, as though it has just now occured to her for the first time that she may not be wholly normal. Anyway, she and everyone else wants to find the Sinsar Dubh. Everyone has their reasons: the Seelie want to take the Song of Making from it to put the walls between world back up, the Kelters want to help the Seelie, the Unseelie just want power, the sidhe-seers want to lock it back up, Barrons wants one specific spell, and Mac's motivations sort of shift a couple times. More importantly the book is killing people and must be stopped. That's the practical action driven portion of the story.<br /><br />The introspective bits are a whole lot more complex. Of course we've all been wondering what Barrons is, and to be honest I'm still not really sure, but at this point who cares? The driving point of this story is who and what is Mac. She's a sidhe-seer, but she also has way more power and endurence than a  human. She has a lot of stuff buried in her head, and it's all tied up with the story of the Unseelie King and his concubine. There are a lot of twists and believe me, I didn't see most of it coming.<br /><br />This book does manage to answer a lot of questions. We find out a lot about Barrons, identify what Mac is, discover the circumstances of Alina's death, resolve the issue with the book and the Unseelie King, and so very much more. It's grand and epic, intensely interesting and satisfying. I felt rewarded for having read the previous books attentively. But there are still plently of unresolved issues. The ending did not feel like an ending to me. Yes Mac comes to and equilibrium, but the world certainly doesn't. I have since been made aware that Moning intends to write more books in this universe. That's fine. But this degree of sequel baiting in what I assumed was a final book leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I enjoyed all of the fever books immensely, but I feel like this story could have been told in four or even three books without the plot suffering much. Certain aspects took way too long to unfold and develope, some of the mysteries could have been solved a lot sooner, and we could have done with several fewer conflicts. I feel like the story just got out of hand, maybe as a result of poor planning on the authors part. This book in particular needed a lot of tightening up and simplifying.<br /><br />In the end, I'm happy with this book. It's a vast, dark and moody tale that delivers many of the answers it promised and even manages a fairly happy ending in terms of romance. Like a hopeless addict I will be reading anything else Moning puts out in this universe, against my better judgement. Mac's story is quite the journey, and I'm both happy and sad to see it end.lot about Barrons, identify what Mac is, discover the circumstances of Alina's death, resolve the issue with the book and the Unseelie King, and so very much more. It's grand and epic, intensely interesting and satisfying. I felt rewarded for having read the previous books attentively. But there are still plently of unresolved issues.

That's fine. But this degree of sequel baiting in what I assumed was a final book leaves a bad taste in my mouth.    I enjoyed all of the fever books immensely, but I feel like this story could have been told in four or even three books without the plot suffering much. Certain aspects took way too long to unfold and develope, some of the mysteries could have been solved a lot sooner, and we could have done with several fewer conflicts. I feel like the story just got out of hand, maybe as a result of poor planning on the authors part. This book in particular needed a lot of tightening up and simplifying.    In the end, I'm happy with this book. It's a vast, dark and moody tale that delivers many of the answers it promised and even manages a fairly happy ending in terms of romance. Like a hopeless addict I will be reading anything else Moning puts out in this universe, against my better judgement. Mac's story is quite the journey, and I'm both happy and sad to see it end.
0792844882|3.0|To me, this basically seemed like a film contrived to showcase a nude Elizabeth Berkley to sell tickets and DVDs. I guess it worked with me, as I could not resist seeing the class president from Saved By The Bell in her birthday suit. There was some plot beyond that, but I think that, for men at least, the only real memories of this will be the showgirls. To be fair, that is the title of it, and that is what it is about.
030726999X|5.0|Don't just read this one. Start with \\"..Dragon tattoo..\\" and read all three. Made me plan a trip to Sweden just to see the talked about places. Wonderful good guys/girls and sinister villians. Just enough violence and perversion. It is a shame we lost this great writer.
B004DK49DW|2.0|Flat riffs, cliche lyrics. What happened? Sure bands evolve but they don't lose their core. There is no edge, energy, or originality in this one. This album is beyond disappointing. I gave it two stars just because or their previous work, otherwise it would have been a one star!
B00006L9ZT|4.0|If I had to choose an opera that I consider to be my personal favorite, it would have to be Richard Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen (or The Ring Cycle for short). Some people may be put off by its incredibly long length (a total of fourteen to fifteen hours worth of music), but I can listen from beginning to end without feeling bored. I've only seen a few theatrical productions, however, and some of the more avant-garde renditions are almost preposterous to look at. The Bicentennial Bayreuth production by Patrice Chereau looks uninspiring and very bland. The Harry Kupfer Bayreuth production from the early 90's, on the other hand, is a spectacular light show, and has a very fascinating futuristic look. I've only seen a few snippets of the more recent productions from the 2000's, and they range from decent to questionable to just plain laughable. Traditional, straightforward productions are few, but they are indeed appropriate for those who are NOT looking for sci-fi aliens holding baseball bats, or crummy 1990's apartment buildings, or giants wearing Italian business suits. The most famous one of all created by the Metropolitan Opera, with Otto Schenk and G&uuml;nter Schneider-Siemssen. This is probably the most traditional stage production that we'll ever get. No weird light effects, no factory mechanics, no basketball cheerleaders whatsoever. This is what Wagner has originally intended: a pre-medieval setting with gods and goddesses, valkyries, giants, dwarves, and mere mortals.  But does that mean that this production is perfect? Not really. Let's break it all down:<br /><br />CONDUCTOR:<br />James Levine is the sole conductor for this production, and he doesn't seem to be the perfect man for this sort of work. I'm not saying that he's a bad conductor. Granted, he knows how to emphasize the beauty of Wagner's music. But sometimes, I wish he would pick up the pace when he's conducting. At least ninety percent of the time, the music feels very ponderous, resulting in a not-so exciting-interpretation that feels almost under-rehearsed. There are several moments in which it's just too dull to listen to, such as when Hagen summons his vassals, or when Wotan bids farewell to Brunnhilde before she is confined in a deep sleep. At the same time, however, he does bring out many details that are rarely heard in both live and studio recordings (whether it's either mono or stereo), and manages to balance each class of instruments almost perfectly: brass, woodwinds, percussion, and strings. There are indeed some very beautiful moments here and there, most notably when Erda and the three Norns appear on stage. The famous \\"Ride of the Valykries\\" in Die Walkure is very lively, while the Rhine Journey in Gotterdammerung can be best described as marvelous. Unfortunately, the 15-hour performance as a whole is filled with plodding tempi: not enough intensity or energy when it's needed elsewhere. If Marek Janowski or Franz Welser-Most were available, I'm sure they would have presented a better understanding of the score.<br /><br />ORCHESTRA:<br />While Levine may not be an excellent conductor, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra may very well be one of the greatest. Although I still prefer the Staatskapelle Dresden from the RCA studio recording, this orchestra is the most beautiful-sounding for the Ring Cycle. The brass are heavy and clear, the woodwinds are appropriately light and refined, the percussion are almost flawless, and the strings are mellow and, without any doubt, very elegant. I especially admire the players during the Forest Murmurs and the orchestral transitions in both Siegfried and Gotterdammerung. The orchestra overall is able to overcome Levine's lethargic conducting and perform superbly during all four operas. They save this from being a completely dull presentation.<br /><br />STAGING:<br />This Ring production defines \\"traditional.\\" There are no traces of avant-garde costumes or sets anywhere. The characters look as if they really ARE from Norse/Germanic mythology. As for the sets, the trees look like real trees. The interior homes look appropriately medieval. Even the sky in the background is devoid of any distracting, or impressionistic, props. The \\"fire\\" from the Magic Fire sequence doesn't look very spectacular, but I don't think it should be, anyway. All in all, it's a very good break from all of the hideous modernistic productions that are taking place right now in the 21st century.<br /><br />SINGING/PERFORMANCES:<br />I wouldn't call James Morris as the ultimate Wotan (Theo Adam takes that place), but he stands on his own with his smooth, intelligent voice. Ekkehard Wlaschiha is a brilliant Alberich, while Heinz Zednik makes a very convincing Mime. Gary Lakes does a good job playing Siegmund, even if he doesn't really have the perfect voice for the character. Hildegard Behrens presents a mightily-sung Brunnhilde, though her low notes sound very awkward. Kurt Moll as Hunding, as well as Matti Salminen doubling as Fafner and Hagen, remain authoritative with their respective roles. Siegfried Jerusalem sings as Siegfried with a stellar voice, but he seems miscast as the cunning trickster Loge (Zednik or Peter Schreier could have done much better). Birgitta Svenden is a lovely Erda who sounds almost hypnotic. Jessye Norman has a very heavy voice, which would explain why she is NOT the right choice as Sieglinde. Sieglinde is an innocent and almost fragile woman, not a high-and-mighty valkyr. Norman would have done a much better job as Brunnhilde rather than Sieglinde. The rest of the cast do a good job, no question about that.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />This is not an excellent production, but it's a very good one, nonetheless. The orchestra sounds beautiful, the sets and costumes are refreshingly old-fashioned, and the vocalists are wonderful. But the slow (and sometimes uninspiring) conducting and a few questionable casting choices prevent me from grading this at least a 7 out of 10. If you're new to Wagner, however, then get this DVD set right now. Wagner's original intentions to the Ring Cycle are good for beginners.<br /><br />Grade: 6.8/10the sets, the trees look like real trees. The interior homes look appropriately medieval.

B000026FJ6|3.0|If you're into EXTREMELY MELLOW music, like david gilmour and such, then this may be for you. I like mellow stuff that is more in the vein of folk or rock. I wouldn't call this either, nor would I call it jazz. I don't think it can really be effectively catagorized--which I suppose is a form of praise. However, I did not really like it. I wish Amazon would have more sound samples!! Oh well, just a warning to others, like me, who maybe are new to Oldfield. Honestly, I just don't like him. But, that doesn't mean it's bad. I would advise trying to hear this before you buy it, though, because it's definately different. Hope this helps!
B0043VCPW8|5.0|The intended sound of the bare bones concert was the acoustics Sound... Crank it up loud.  Beautiful reminder of the raw beauty of his voice, beautiful piano accompliment. This is what Bryan's music is about, the voice, the lyrics and the guitar.  I think when I am over on the Other Side that Bryan is still singing and banging out the beautiful music.  All the classics and a few new ones.  I don't ever get tired of listening to his voice, bare bones or not.
B000KFTWIG|5.0|The CD and case were in very good shape and the package arrived very quickly. I would purchase products from this individual again in the future.
B001DMJ9R4|4.0|The 2-disc set is very good for what it is, and for the price I suppose you get what you pay for, but on the whole it feels a bit lacking.  The concert itself is, as you would expect from A7X, incredibly energetic and includes songs from Waking the Fallen, City of Evil, and their self-titled release, so it is a good mix of old and (for the time) new.  The guitar solos are also all on-point, and Matt's voice is great, especially considering (and I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong on this) they had to cancel some of the shows after this one due to strain on his voice.  The bonus b-sides and covers disc is also definitely worth adding to any fan's collection and, honestly, would probably be worth it for the (somehow even heavier than the original feeling) cover of Pantera's Walk even if everything else on it stunk.    The only real issue is the lack of anything special on the DVD.  You get the show, sure, and it definitely rocks hard but you get precious little else.  No interviews, no real behind the scenes footage (other than the multiple show openings for the tour), etc.    Granted, this release did come relatively hot on the heels of All Excess which basically covers all of what this disc lacks.  Ultimately, I think, they would have been better served to have done a combination of All Excess and Live in the LBC in one set rather than having two completely separate releases to be more in line with what a lot of other bands are doing where you get the show and the extras as well, but in the end there is nothing inherently bad about this set.    If it were more costly, it would get 3 stars.  If it had more bonus material on the DVD, it would get 5 stars.  On its own merits, it is still a solid 4 for any A7X fan and worth the price, even in this economy.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|watched this growing up and I had to have - it was better without commericals. You see it's great with the way it is presented
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Upon opening the box and getting to fondle this little chunk of steel for a while, there are several qualities I felt were worth sharing with the rest of the online community. My reason for purchasing this particular knife was like most everyone else, as a multiple use camp knife.   Processing and batoning wood (glorified names for splitting and chopping) are what many of the folks around the interwebs list as the primary tasks that the bk2 is suited. While I found this to be true, it also does a fairly decent job of quartering game as well. Out of the box, it was sharp enough to skin most of a hog (got a bit dull towards the end) and did excellent work chopping through the joints as well. Resharpening was a breeze.    Even though i appreciate the extra hefty construction and solid feel of the knife as a whole, there are several things that I am slightly less than happy with.  The handle, though very comfortable, is quite slick - easily fixed with some skateboard tape.  The kydex portion of the sheath works great to retain the sheath by its self, but the nylon belt loop is abysmal. It does a really poor job of keeping the knife balanced on my belt and the clasp that secures the handle does not function (the webbing is cut is too short to reach all the way around the handle).    Aside from the less than stellar sheath, i really do like this knife and would recommend it to anyone needing a good multipurpose camp knife. Its impressive heft suggests it would also be useful for crushing boulders, climbing out of a cave that one may have fallen into, or for bludgeoning a medium sized animal to death should it ever get dull.

B003EY7IRC|2.0|I was a late comer in reading the Fever series as well as the Highlander series. I was hooked after the first fever read. I read all of the series anxiously awaiting Shadowfever. First of all, to be supportive of Karen Moning, I pre-ordered Shadow Fever. That was disappointed because I had to wait for the arrival by mail days after the release when I still could have supported her by purchasing in the bookstore...(my stupidity, not hers...just excited). Secondly, I was blow away by the novelty of the clear lucite book cover..really gorgeous, but not really functional while reading...had to remove it.(It falls off easily when trying to read, annoying). Lastly-- what happened in this story? Geez, I was so disappointed with all the reflecting, subreflecting, and stayed confused throughout most of the book. Stil am.  She is a brilliant writer that has kept me glued to her previous stories and characters. Would I buy another book from her? YES, you bet. This woman oozes talent! Her expressiveness in this last story was disappointing, but then you can't please everyone all the time.  Oh, and although her choice of Barron's look a like live person (actor) is gorgeous...I mean GORGEOUS, I think it is unwise to place a real person in a fictional story because it destroys that person's fantasy.  I remember when FABIO was on a talk show years ago, I was taken by surprise. I did not know he was a \\"real\\" person. Many woman voiced opinions of distaste in bringing him forward as a real person. These books are fiction. Fantasy. Leave them that way.  And, leave never ending philosophy and reflecting to a fair percentage. It over took the entire story. Sorry, Karen. I do love your writing usually.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Despite this not being your typical vampire movie, it's amongst the best vampire movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />Forget about fairy vampires who glitter in the sunlight and move in slow motion. This movie explores the nature of the vampire in a way few movies ever have, probably since Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire. The balance between the vampiric nature of the main character and his perhaps unexplored human persona, is brilliantly maintained during the course of the movie and the result is simply astounding.<br /><br />Yes, there are many people who love pretending to be snub movie critics who trash this version just for the sake of being a remake and can't wait to tell everybody they DID  watch the original Swedish version. But for those who are willing to put all bias aside and watch the movie without preconceptions, I think they will find a masterly adapted work of art here. Yes, this is a remake but it's and incredible masterpiece that stands on its own merit and will make you think like few vampire movies ever have.
0802130208|5.0|This truly is a very funny book.  This guy, this guy is hysterical.  Ignatius J. Reily.  He kind of reminds me of myself, although I am not overweight and I do have a job, but I feel the way he does about this world and how most of it is in poor taste.  When you can resonate with the main character of a book, it makes it easier to enjoy it.  There are some interesting dialects in here, which gives you the feel of New Orleans in the early 1960s.  I've never been there, and I probably wouldn't want to go now due to the oil spill, but it seems to capture the city and its environment perfectly.  Even though it was written in the 1960s, I still find it to be really funny.  I don't like most older novels because they lose me in a time trap.  Being born in the mid 1980s, I was surprised at how easy it was to relate to the story.  Ignatius pulls all sorts of stunts in this book that are utterly hilarious.  Definitely read this book if you are looking for a good laugh.  Tragic the author killed himself, but I'm not sure if this book would have ever been published if he didn't.
1444710338|4.0|I was so excited to hear tht this diet was coming to the States.... Im French and live here in NJ but my whole family in France are talking about this and how fast you'll lose weight. Couldnt wait til May 2011 when its released in the USA,so I ordered it thru Amazon from  England. Though the book still has mostly european foods(Like Fromage Blanc ou Frais)listed in which are difficult to get here, its still a great book to read n get the jist of the Diet. This diet is based on an ALL protein diet which will introduce other foods little by little. I have lost 10LBS in the first 2wks(Attack phase), and am currently on the 2nd phase until I reach my goal weight, next will be the consilidation phase n stabilization. THe down fall of this diet is tht you are on this for LIFE!! So i hope u like fish,poultry,Lean meats & Non-Fat Dairy cuz thts it Folks!! Good Luck to All....
0385523912|1.0|First of all, I didnt read this book.    I just saw the cover image in Amazon.com, and that tells a lot about the book.    The cover image is showing winter scene of North Korea, with big Kim, Il Sung portrait looking at things.    This alone tells me a lot about this book and the authors intensions with this book.    The cover image could be the Korea's most beutiful mountain Keum Kang in spring time or modern PyongYang Scene with well organized and beutiful DaeDong river flowing.    Korea has four distinctive season. Spring, Summer, fall, and winter.    Why winter scene only? which is most groomy/bad weather in North Korea?     I found most of North Korea videos on internet are winter scenes, however.    This is just another book with full of elaborated distorting stories about North Korea.    It probably tells a story in the eye of a few North Korean defectors who are basically social outcasts, type of people who even western society view as losers.    Currently about 30,000,000 people in US are on food stamps.  2 million in US are in prison.  1 milions are basically living on streets and outdoors.

0307266303|4.0|I am an avid runner, so I was definitely interested in reading this.  McDougal definitely conveys his love of running, and he does a good job of showing how ultra marathoning exploded into the public view, especially the Leadville 100. The beginning does read like a bit of an adventure story, where he chroicles his pursuit of Caballo Blanco.  I liked how the author introduced the various characters that ultimately made the trip down to the final race.    Having said that, this book had a hard time keeping my interest for some reason.  I think the problem was (for me, anyway) that the book read like a series of magazine articles which is not surprising considering that's how the book got its genesis (through McDougal's magazine writing).  However, better editing would have lead to a more seamless transition between chapters.    While I don't blame McDougal for the editing woes, I was disappointed at the abrupt ending.  I enjoyed the last chapter about Caballo's background.  However, I think another chapter was in order-it would have been great to have the perspectives of the other runners in that final race.  Did racing with the Tarahumana change their outlook on running? Did it change them in other ways?    Despite these shortcomings, ultimately I enjoyed reading the book and gave me a lot to think about with running.  I'd recommend it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|To wish that a movie is the last in the franchise sounds somewhat negative.  However, the story arc and resolution of Toy Story 3 is so poignant and effective that it can't be followed by a new story.  In short, the plot centres around a college-bound Andy who has outgrown his toys - Woody, Buzz, Rex, Ham, etc.  In a series of misunderstandings, they all end up at a daycare centre.  This is all pretty lightweight stuff so far, and not very interesting.  When they get to the daycare, however, the plot thickens as they discover it is run by a big Strawberry-scented bear named Lotso who runs the place like a banana-republic dictatorship.  Andy's toys are banished to the room with the youngest children who proceed to misuse them dreadfully (e.g. using Jesse's hair as a paintbrush).    Many people have compared the film to the Great Escape, and indeed the best part of the movie involves the elaborate plan to break out of Sunnyside Daycare.  It also borrows somewhat from Bridge on the River Kwai, with Buzz collaborating (after being factory-reset) with Lotso's crew, and Woody, having escaped, returning to help his friends' cause.  This is the point where the screenwriters show their cleverness - Pixar films always work best when the stories don't simply set a human story being played by toys (or animals or cars) but where the solutions grow organically from the properties of the toys themselves.  Hence, Mr. Potato Head uses the fact that his parts still work when detached from the potato to great effect.  Barbie uses Ken's metrosexuality as a weapon against him to extract vital information from him.  And when Buzz is re-reset and ends up in Spanish mode.... well, that is sheer brilliance.  Their Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Story is well-earned.    This is clearly the most emotionally loaded Toy Story, and is very intense at the end.  Certainly, my 5-year old was okay watching it, but my 3-year old was scared and refuses to watch the end parts.  That gives you an indication of the level of intensity if you plan to but this for younger children.  I don't think it's giving anything away to say there is a happy ending, but perhaps not the one you'd expect (yes, Andy goes to college and the toys do not accompany him).  Luckily, the end credits provide a very important (and funny) wrapup to let you end on a smile.  (In fact, I can't think of a more effective use of a song at the end of a film, except possibly \\"Always Look On the Bright Side of Life\\" at the end of Monty Python's Life of Brian.)    Ultimately, this film may endear itself to me as my favourite Toy Story.  I'm not ready to make that decision yet (having only watched it 4 or 5 times), but it's certainly the equal of the first two films in the franchise.  I bought the DVD version (because Disney Blu-rays drive me nuts!), and there are some neat extras, certainly enough for me without an entire 2nd disc of extras like in the 3-disc Blu-ray set.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|A great dvd package, so much beautiful cinematography and earth knowledge, you feel like an elemetary student again! Well worth the price.

There may be a song that you would have selected for this list instead of some of the others and maybe when you are sitting on your ass not doing a thing you can find fault with this genius.  But you ain't Carlos!  He is and has been crazy cool for decades.  He has provided an outstanding mix of artists and songs that have allowed me to cover many miles much more quickly than otherwise.  Keep on rockin' Carlos!!

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|At first I was not sure if I really liked it or if they were trying to hard.  I listed a few more times and realized I really like their music.  A few songs (maybe two) I don't like, but don't hate.  The Cave is a great song that I like immediately and sometimes skip through to hear it again.  The acoustic music with the banjo sounds nice and is overall pleasant.  The songs kind of build so they are fun to run to or work out to.    If you don't like it listening through one or two times wait and play again.  I look forward to their sophomore effort to see what they build on and run with (keep up the good acoustic music).

0071636080|5.0|I made presentation and speech about 2-3 times a month, so I tought I was a master on it somehow. However I found a lot of ideas in this book which I then implemented into my presentation. It worked like magic. I caught more attention. I attracted more responses. I received more praises after each of my presentation.    The main important things which change my presentation is simplification of slides and streamlining messages into only a few main points. I used to think that I had to list and explain every single things, but as I follow Steve's strategy, focusing on few significant points motivated audience to explore the rest.
B000002KB8|5.0|This album needs to be rated in the top 100 albums of the 70s by Guitar World.  What a KILLER album. Brings me back to the Army days at FT. KNOX, KY. Classic heavy metal. Beats any metal out there today. Raw and innovative. I am glad to see it is being reissued on CD and album. Plan to buy both.  Living in Kentucky back in the day, the WALRUS (WLRS)out of Louisville, would play album oriented rock during the late hours. Both sides of classic rock vinyl would be played from midnight till dawn.If I owned a radio station nothing but vinyl would be broadcast. This album made the airwaves. So for anybody that likes heavy metal go back to the roots or as close as one can gets and purchase Black Sabbath. Peace.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|A great new spin on the story of Robin Hood. One of the best historical fiction movies ever produced. And an enjoyable way to spark an interest in history in young and old alike. While Americans wouldn't notice it, I do understand the Brittish criticism of Russell Crow's accent. I watched a production of an American play in a Brittish country once. The fake American accents made the actors appear far less talented than they actually were. As an American, I very much enjoyed Russell Crow's performance. I especially loved Cate Blanchett's role. She is always wonderful to see in historical fiction movies.

In fact Ten Years After's performance ( Going Home) at Woodstock is Smokin!!!!!!!!!!  TYA Live rates up with the ABB Live at the Fillmore,and The Rolling Stones, Get Yer Ya's Ya's Out. Ten Years After a band that should not be forgotten, an excellent trio of musical talent. A ball of fire!!!
B0000E6XH3|3.0|Well I just got done watching this and I must say I am a little suprised by all the hype surrounding this movie. First things first, I have been a daft punk fan since I was a teen and theres no falting the excellent music on this dvd, the story however is well, a different story. I found it to be a little confusing at best and a little dull at worst. The animation is fine but nothing to do back flips over. I guess I was just excpecting alot more. The concept of doing a whole movie to a daft punk album is quite brilliant though, and I did love the ending.
B002EWD0I6|4.0|The series is terrific and we found the subtitles helpful in understanding  the dialog which is sometimes drowned out by the music.  The music should be  toned down!!  On the first disk we got the subtitles OK, then couldn't get  them to come on in the next disks.  We probably will buy season 2.
B00023BLXK|5.0|If you loved Dirty Dancing the original, then you will love this one as well.  Since it is set in pre Castro Havana, you will also learn a little bit of Cuban history.  The dancing is wonderful.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This novel kept me up late at night because I couldn't put it down. When I reached the last page, I was sad it was over. I literally almost went right back to the beginning to start over. I wanted more. The main character was on my mind even when I wasn't reading. \\"I wonder how Jack's doing?\\" I'd find myself wondering. \\"What would Jack think of this?\\" Wait. Jack's not real! Donahue did an amazing job with this main character - so believable, so right on. Loved this book and would highly recommend.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This works perfectly, but it can very easily be lost because its so mall, i wouldnt recommend it for someone who is constantly on the go because im pretty sure it would get lost. Other than than the size it works just as needed
B004FJJGBG|5.0|I got this as soon as I found it available on the net. It will not be available commercially for some time and that, of course, means the price is WAY to high for most viewers. I was willing to be taken for a ride but if you do not just have to have it now I would recommend waiting until it is available everywhere.<br />The video quality is fantastic. I have a Samsung 40\\" 3D setup and the movie was just beautiful to watch. Not quite the same as IMAX but very close (size of screen being the only difference that I could see). The 3D is, to my eyes, exactly as good as the IMAX on-screen version. I am a huge fan of the movie but believe me I would tell you if the video quality was not great.<br />I would not hesitate to do the purchase again (even considering the huge rip-off in price at this time) but advise others to consider if you really have to have it right now or can wait awhile.<br />Great movie, almost unbelievable video transfer quality, and a price that is just not right!<br />Hope this helps.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|Like everyone else, I couldn't wait for this final installment to come out.   The beginning was soooo annoying (Mac talking to herself) and could've been skipped. KMM's constant use of abbreviations was additionally annoying.  Don't get me wrong, the book was fairly good and answered most questions left lingering from the previous books, but not all were answered.  Spoilers:  Why did KMM build up Mac to be the one who ends up saving the day and she never does?  Why are the Keltars and their annoying clan even in the book?  Why do the unkillable men(I.e. Ryodan)  follow Barrons and why are they unkillable?  I am so disappointed with the ending.  After such a long wait, this book did not deliver it for me.  The only good thing was Mac and Barrons are finally together.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|For those of you saying that the \\"improved\\" versions of the original trilogy are fine and we don't need the actual original version, I want you to think of it this way. Think of a movie in the last couple of years that you loved and that was absolutely groundbreaking in what it did. A movie that changes the way people look at movies and one that will be loved years and quoted years after it is released.  Then imagine that in about 20 years, the director has removed himself from moviemaking except for special effects. He's lost all contact with the things that made his original movies great. So he releases \\"improved\\" version which change parts of the story and add in special effects, which is all he knows now. (Think Inception with changes to plot points and with computer-generated weird characters thrown in throughout.)  Should not the original movies, which were the ones that started it all, be available for future generations?  Or should the director's perverted \\"improved\\" versions be the ones seen in the future?  The originals are the classics and the only ones that matter.
B00004SVID|5.0|No one does alienation madness and despair better than Roger Waters' Pink Floyd.  And this album is a great excuse to go back and listen to it again.  Of course we know all the words by heart even though we memorized them 20 years ago.  Still, the live show from 1981 if you haven't heard it, is well done and maintains the energy of the original album quite well, perhaps unsurprisingly.  But it is still surprisingly moving.  I don't think anyone had done anything quite so lonely, despairing, angry, demented and beautiful as The Wall prior to this - in the history of music.  Waters's Pink Floyd captured something so elemental, so universal almost so basic and yet so eloquent and theatrical that it still stands as a monument, a mirror to the modern soul.  It needed to be done.  Thank you Roger Waters and Pink Floyd.  I know Gilmore didn't care for the direction he was going in, but I loved \\"The Final Cut\\" as well.  Wonder if they ever recorded that live..
B000FP2OPY|5.0|yes it was. i really enjoyed this show, im glad i finaly bought it. ive seen episodes here and there but never known the whole story to it.
B003L77GH4|4.0|I bought this series to survive my vampire fix until \\"True Blood\\" season premiered.  It took me a while to get passed the immaturity and over-romanticised view our teens have on finding love.  Like 90210, I had a hard time buying into the notion that in a school of hundreds of students, only 6-7 students mattered to anyone there.  The Damien character irritated me severely but actually proved to be the character with the most depth, as the series continued.  Stefen is too \\"Edward Cullen\\" for me.  I can't help but think they could have been more original in providing the love interest of heroine, Elena, as \\"True Blood\\" did Sookie, w/ Bill. Dobrev is clearly the most beautiful heroine in a trendy genre that also includes \\"True Blood\\" and all \\"Twilight\\" sagas.  I watch it mainly for her.  I was very dissapointed to see the petite, cute and intellectual, Chino-American vampire leave the show. I always looked forward to her character as well. I also resented that they allowed lovely, Mia Kirchner to be so maternal and homely. I'm mainly sticking around for Dobrev and Candace Accola at this point, hoping for some improvement in the vampire erotica scenes.  The original air time \\"sucks\\" unless you're a teen.  I have to watch it on dvd after prime-time.
0312370849|4.0|The hallmark of a good book is the ability to draw the reader in and then keep her up at night, unwilling to put the book down. This book has that as we follow Sara through her tragic experiences, knowing that the key she holds onto so desperately, does not represent hope, but tragedy. I was completely unaware of this dark piece of French history and found myself both repelled and fascinated. However, I wish the author had stayed in the past, with Sara, taking us deeper into her life and showing us how it affected her adult years. Using a journalist to tell the story, and moving between her story and Sara's, feels intrusive and unnecessary, a structure the author could have done without. Overall, however, it is a compelling story, well worth reading and ideal for book clubs.
B004DK49DW|5.0|Another great record from one of the greatest bands on earth.  Doesn't sound like past records which is what I love about this!  All the songs are good in my humble opinion so I can't say my favorite (though probably Diamond in the Rough).  If you like ALL of Social D's catalog, you will like this.  If you only like White Light etc.  you probably won't enjoy this one as much.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After having more time to digest this record, I have decided that it is perfect so I upped my rating.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|The second record I ever owned was the 45 rpm version \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand / I Saw Her Standing There\\" in 1964.  Through various incarnations of other singles, LP's, reel to reel tape, CD's, DVD audio and now the ubiquitous USB.  What a long, strange trip...    I have only had the USB for a couple of days and I cannot stop listening to it.  That being said here are some steps you might want to follow.  1. Load the entire folder structure from the USB on to your hard drive maintaining the original folder order.  2. Because I use iTunes to manage my library, I had to convert the Flac files to Apple lossless.  Depending on your system set-up that might not be necessary.  3. I used dbpoweramp, a great program for Windows (Mac users check out MAX file converter).  Dbpoweramp does batch file conversions.  I did one album at a time.  To do the conversion I created a separate folder and added sub-folders with all of the album titles and put the Apple lossless versions there.  The original Flac file is not affected when you create the Apple version.  4. After doing all of that in about one hour, I backed up everything I completed to a back-up hard drive that connects via USB.  5. Then I put the little Beatles USB back in the Apple it came in, placed all original documentation in the box and put it away.  I do not plan to use it again unless I have a catastrophic computer failure.    Observations  1. It is very convenient to use.  2. The sound is absolutely the best we have (so far).  It is full, warm with excellent midrange and extremely deep bass.  The treble is not overly bright or brash.  It is a very smooth sound.  3. Instruments and vocal harmonies are much more defined.  There are guitar licks, bass melodies, various drum hits and voices in the harmonies that I have never heard.  4. Do not buy this unless you have a playback system where the audio quality of a 24-bit file can be realized and your computer can connect to your processor digitally.  That is unless you are buying for collection purposes or shear simplicity of not having to deal with shiny discs.  5. I can confirm what another reviewer said that Rubber Soul did not convert with the Meta data in iTunes (go figure).    Conclusion  I waited to purchase and researched for a long time due to a number of potential pitfalls that might have been encountered.  I avoided all of the pitfalls and I am very pleased.  I am even happier because several days after I bought it, the price increased dramatically (good luck I guess).    In the Amazon blog, there were many discussions about computers not being able to transmit the 24-bit file to the computer due to sound card issues (I do not believe I have that problem).  I will check into that because my blu-ray player has a USB input and I am going to connect my back-up hard drive to it and see if there is an improvement in sound quality.  The blu-ray is connected to my processor via HDMI.  I will submit a follow-up with the results.  Buy the little apple while it is still available.    PS:  Follow-up on the blu-ray playback is delayed due to the Sony BDP-570 being only capable of playing lossy audio files.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Shadowfever is a timeless work of art that succeeded in creating a centrifuge of emotions never before felt. The only equivalent would be seeing music or tasting colors. The entire experience of reading this work was fantastic. Brilliant.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|New beautiful way of looking at nature. so close, so intense, so real. I've learned so much watching these beautiful creatures, it's environment and habitats and the need to preserve and conserve this creatures.
B00275EHJG|2.0|I can only imagine that the folks who gave this 5 stars did so in the thrall of the closing moments which are the only ones with any emotion and the only ones worth watching. The rest of it is dull and, like many movies, it represents a missed opportunity and a waste of resources. I don't know why anyone would have strong feelings about it.    The first one was excellent; the second was ok; this one is mostly a waste of time.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I did not know what to expect from this movie when I sat down to watch it.  I have seen all the Predator and Alien movies, and there have been some hits and misses for sure.  When I saw the previews before the movie came out, it looked interesting, but I never made it to the theatres, nor did I see any critics' reviews.  Now I can say that I was pleased with the movie.      The movie starts off with Adrien Brody freefalling through the atmosphere, when his parachute opens, and he lands in a jungle.  I loved the opening of the movie, as right away it engages you.  Royce (American Black Ops) quickly meets Cuchillo (Mexican cartel played by Danny Trejo), who are both shot at by Nikolai, a Russian Special Ops guy.  Slowly, they encounter other \\"mysterious\\" persons in the jungle which include Hanzo (Yakuza), Mombasa (African mercenary), Isabelle (South American IDF played by Alice Braga), Stans ( FBI Most Wanted played by Walter Goggins), and Edwin ( a Doctor played by Topher Grace).  8 in all.  There was one more, but his chute did not open.  The group slowly makes its way through the jungle, slowly realizing that something is very wrong.  I will not get into too much plot, as that has been covered in other reviews, but the group does eventually meet up with another American named Noland ( played by Laurence Fishburne).  Noland has survived for a number of years, but is he on the survivors or Predators side?      There are definitely similiarities between this movie and the first \\"Predator\\", but there are also some cool differences.  In Predator, you had Arnold leading a group of Special Ops, where Predators the group is a bunch of unsavory or criminal characters.  In this film, there are 2 new types of creatures introduced.  First there are the Predator \\"dogs\\" that do the Predators bidding.  Also, there is some other \\"alien\\" that is released from boxes that the Predators hunt.  The most interesting thing that is introduced in this movie is the 2 different types of Predators.  You have the original Predator from the first 2 Predator films, and then the new \\"upgraded\\" Predators of this film.  From the new Predators, there are 3 sub-types:  Berserker, Tracker, and the Falconer.  Eventually, we get to see who is the strongest... the Classic or the New?  I also enjoyed a reference made by Isabelle to the 1st Predator film, after the group encounters the Predators in the Predators camp.  She talks about how Arnold survived the \\"first\\" encounter with a Predator.  There is also a great scene with a 1v1 battle of Hanzo vs a Predator, in a homage to the 1st film again where the Native American waits on the fallen log to do battle 1v1.  Here though, we get to see this epic battle.      There are some Special Features on this DVD which include:    * \\"Commentary By Robert Rodriguez (Producer) and Nimrod Antal (Director)  * \\"Decloaking The Invisible: Alien Terrain\\"  An interesting segment on the various background they used for the      jungle scenes, and how they intercut jungle scenes from Texas and Hawaii to match up.  * \\"Motion Comics\\"  Exclusive prequel scenes to the actual movie.  * \\"Predators\\" Theatrical Trailer  * \\"Trailers\\" for the movies Machete, A-Team, and Mirrors II      I know there seems to be several differing opinions on this film in the reviews section.  Though I believe, if you enjoyed the 1st Predator film, you will definitely enjoy this one.  Yes, it is similar, but there are some cool differences also.  Enjoy !
030746363X|5.0|Read the book cover to cover and to have the information in one place is great. His self study is intense. I started the Slow carb diet a month ago and its has changed my appearance and it has changed me. Whether you knew the the information in the book before or not, its clear and concise nature is simple enough to follow. You can see the differences in a short period of time no matter the parts of the book on which you focus.

I would rather have a good relationship with my children and enjoy them for who they are and who they will become that to take pleasure in what I have MADE them to be.  The most important thing you can teach a child is how to make good choices, rather than make the choices for them.  I'd rather be a Mom who can spend time with her daughter having lunch and talking about a variety of subjects that be my daughter's \\"Manager\\", with my work being final.  I am extremely proud of both of my children and in looking back and watching them continue to grow I believe we did the right thing.

0756405890|2.0|I'd really like to give this book a much better score.  It is well written and interesting.  But it does not stand alone in any way.  As the first book in a trilogy it's ok to not finish up many of the story lines.  But this book finishes none of them.  I feel sorry for anybody who first read this in 2007 then had to wait for years for a sequel (which very well could pull the same trick).  I finished reading and really wanted to keep going, but since there is a third book planned with no release date, I can't commit to another possibly 4 year wait.
B000089RVX|5.0|I had owned this album before. I lost my original when things went south with an old fling. After a while I saved up my money and the album is still just as good as the day I originally bought it.

B002ZG98CS|3.0|\\"MACHETE DON'T TEXT\\" was one of the Top 10 Lines of 2010, according to some year-end lists. Those of us who refuse the continual intrusions of cell phone technology cheered in support. Unfortunately, Machete - played by the magnificent Danny Trejo - succumbs, three-quarters of the way through the film.    Disappointing ... as have too many of the films Robert Rodriguez has delivered since \\"Sin City.\\" There's no heart in this action flick, just a parade of violence and lust.     While \\"Machete\\" doesn't rise to the quality of Rodriguez's first \\"El Mariachi,\\" its pacing hits light speed and the action is outrageous and gory. The women have rolled out of a Penthouse fantasy, especially in the deleted scenes extra. Most disappointing is the exploitation of Lindsay Lohan. Nude scenes with Lohan and  Alicia Rachel Marek are obviously air-brushed and over the top. Nothing about them feel comfortable or right.    Other female characters fight in stilettos and wear black leather bras, eye patches and micro-minis as they gun down villains. The plot revolves around bad Americans who bloodily enforce anti-immigration laws in an especially ugly way.    The cast is composed of Rodriguez's extended family of actors: Robert De Niro (Trejo, Rodriguez's cousin, appeared with him in \\"Heat\\"), Don Johnson (bud of Cheech Marin and long time regular in Rodriguez projects), Jessica Alba (\\"Sin City\\") and Michelle Rodriguez (Robert's wife). Steven Seagal and Jeff Fahey also appear.    Trejo's face, a Day of the Dead visage come alive, seems made for HD - and Blu-ray is his artist; every line, scar and muscle shines in detail. The film begins with the look of an old grindhouse flick, then progresses to smooth HD sheen. The color is bright and hot, especially on sun-drenched streets and furious muscle cars; the variety of skin tones is good. Detail reveals worn leather and well-used weapons. The sound is fierce - balancing dialogue, gunplay, ambient noise and a rich score by John Debney and Carl Thiel.     Just as the film is not overburdened by plot, the disc is not overwhelmed with extras. Aside from the live-theater release, there are a few R- and even X-rated scenes that were wisely deleted from the final cut. Those with BDLive-enabled players can access behind-scenes footage and a digital version is also included.     To be sure, I admire Rodriguez as a writer and director; all of his earlier films are in my personal library. I just wish he'd bring us more palatable stories with characters his audience could care about. I've been waiting for a film featuring Danny Trejo, but this isn't it.

I wasn't getting my hopes up too high, as honestly second books many times do not deliver the punch of the first.  I think especially when you are writing fantasy fiction is can be easy to lose the magic along the way...  Not so with Linger.<br /><br />Within a few pages I was transported right back to Mercy Falls Minnesota, right where I left off... there was Sam, still head over heals in love Grace... and Grace still madly in love with Sam.... and this time there is so much more....<br /><br />action.<br /><br />More...<br /><br />to lose than there was before....<br /><br />it is so...<br /><br />INTENSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I started this book last night (after having misplaced it for a little over a week it was found in the book room....

B002ZG980U|2.0|\\"Inception\\" is writer/director Christopher Nolan's latest attempt convey a vague impression of profundity, through relentless CGI and explosive action, where there is nothing but clich&eacute;. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a mercenary who specializes in extracting information from other people's minds while they sleep, when they are in a dream state. Some mishap along these lines got him in trouble with the law in the United States, so he cannot return home to his young children. For all of his skills and taste for adrenalin, Cobb wants nothing more than to go home. So he's eager to take a job for Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe), who promises that he can fix Cobb's legal problems in the US.<br /><br />Mr. Saito is in the market for corporate espionage. The owner of the world's largest energy company is on his death bed, and his son Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) stands to inherit. Saito wants Mr. Fischer to break up his father's company. He wants Cobb to do something dangerous and unconventional: Instead of extracting information from his victim, he will plant an idea in the man's head, disguised so that Fischer will believe it was his own. For this mission, Cobb assembles a team of specialists: Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architect who will create the environment of the dreams, Eames (Tom Hardy), who impersonates people, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who puts people under, and Cobb's trusty assistant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).<br /><br />This is just \\"Mission Impossible\\" in a dreamscape, and those old television shows had better writers. Cobb is a crook doing one last big job that is supposed to solve all of his problems, as if we needed another clich&eacute;. And it's all about \\"family values\\"; the guy just wants to get back to his kids and shake the guilt-ridden memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who keeps popping up in the dreams like some demonic whack-a-mole. The movie is 2 ½ hours long, and it's mostly filler. The entire first hour is filler: superfluous action sequences and endless conversations whose sole purpose is to explain the technical aspects of creating and entering someone's dreams. The dialogue is so stilted that the actors can barely spit it out.<br /><br />As he did in \\"Titanic\\", Leonardo DiCaprio manages to bring a certain weight to his character in spite of the fact that everything he says sounds like it was written by a 12-year-old who has only primetime television dramas and Saturday morning cartoons to draw on. Ken Watanabe, on the other hand, is completely wasted here. He has nothing to do. Ellen Page is dreadfully miscast -so badly so that I wonder if it was intended as a joke. She's like a mouse dropped into the middle of an action movie. The action sequences are so boring and purposeless that you will need reading material to keep you conscious. And the whole thing is predicated on the idea that some Japanese tycoon can control the American criminal justice system, instantly, with one phone call. \\"Inception\\" is Nolan's most hollow and formulaic film to date.nd endless conversations whose sole purpose is to explain the technical aspects of creating and entering someone's dreams.

0439023483|5.0|I'm 40 yrs old and I resisted reading this series for a while (just like Harry Potter) HUGE MISTAKE (on both counts)  Like many others, I literally could not put these books down.  I bought all 3 books at once and am so happy I did.  I read them all in 4 days.  My husband had to pry the books out of my hands at about midnight every night and force me to go to sleep.  I've already lent them out to someone who also finished all 3 in about 4 days.    They are remarkable.  The story is non stop, the charachters are engaging, and I would find myself thinking about the books all night.  I even had a nightmare one night that I was in the games.    Please do not let the YA category scare you off- quite frankly, I think this is more of an adult series (especially the last book)  it just so happens that the charachters are young.    FANTASTIC!!  Too bad they don't have 10 stars in their rating system...it deserves it!!!

B003EY7IRC|5.0|another great series by karen moning, these fever books are such a story there is a fan club for it's characters!  this book answers all the questions we've ever needed an answer to from the first 3 books.  a fantastic, enthralling, makes you want it to never end, ending to a great story.
B00192IV9U|5.0|This is an Unbelievable Beautiful Tribute to those of us who loved Michael Jackson as the best entertainer of our time. It is also somewhat hard to listen to this beautifully mastered CD knowing that I've heard many of these tunes before; now just remastered as he would have loved. Akon did a beautiful job in putting clips of MJ's Bucharest concert into play in the video made to compliment his song with MJ. This is only the beginning folks. MJ has many unreleased songs. I am very pleased Akon, 50Cent and Lenny Kravitz got to showcase their joint efforts with MJ in the first of many to come. Track 4 is on MJ's Ultimate Collection, just remastered a little differently. Beautiful music and beautiful pictures and artistry in one little case.
0920668372|5.0|I first heard this book almost 12 years ago with my mom at a mothers day banquet just before she passed away. When I found out I was pregnant I requested this book because i remembered it being the sweetest mother/child book. my 5yo son and I now sing it together & it's his song... thank you to the author for writing such a beautiful book!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I saw this in the theatre when it came out last fall. Yes, there are some inaccurracies.  Call it Hollywood.  Those flaws do not lessen the impact of Secretariat's story in any way.  The coin flip was decided the year before Secretariat was born.  Ogden Phipp's did win the flip of the coin.  That left Mrs. Chenery with the Somethihngroyal foal of 1970 who of course turned out to be Secretariat.  She was not present at his birth, rather her father was.  I believe it was Ms. Ham who said \\"whopper\\" in regards to Secretariat.      It was Angle Light who won the Wood 3 weeks before the Derby.  I've read alot of people who said that Disney made it sound like Sham had won.  But if you listen closely to the call at the finish--the announcer says its Angle Light and Sham with Secretariat coming in third.  Yes, it was kind of awkward and for those not closely associated to this story you might be misled.    Overall I think Diane Lane brought Penny to life for a whole new generation of kids who don't don't this story.  Watch the credits and you will see Penny listed as the consultant.    One of Secretariat's grandkids actually played him in the movie.  It was shot at Churchhill Downs.  Disney really did do an outstanding job with this movie making it as true as they could--and still adding more Hollywood to a story that really didn't need it.    My biggest complaint with the dvd is the coloring.  It looks awful on my HD tv.  I had to adjust stuff cause leaving things at neutral leaves Secretariat's blinkers looking green.  They should look somewhere between medium and navy blue with chalk white on them--with the red coat of Secretariat.  Perhaps its just my copy or my tv.  It's simple to adjust.  Once you do you will immensely enjoy this movie even more.    A wonderful piece of history.  One that kids today should watch.  Kate Tweedy was into protesting Vietnam--that's a history lesson for middle schoolers!  Plus its family friendly, no bad words and no behaviour that would make parents think twice about letting their kids see.    Hollywood we need more great horse stories like this.  Ones that kids can learn from.  We desperately need family friendly movies that all can watch and not be worried about content.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Although this is a remake of the 1970's film by the same name [[ASIN:B00006FDAP The Mechanic]] which starred Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent, there are only a few similarities between the two and a lot more differences. This movie has a lot more special effects and action sequences, but seems to lack considerably in the character development of Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) and Steve McKenna (Ben Foster) and the relationship between the two men. I was also a bit disappointed in the instructional and training period that should have taken place between the master hitman and his protege. I felt that this should have been developed more than it was, and what was shown seemed to be lacking in substance.<br /><br />The plot runs pretty much the same as the original, but there are some notable difference, which I won't go into here so as not to ruin the movie for those of you who still haven't seen it yet. However, for those of you who have watched the original pay particular attention to the end of the film, where things aren't always what they seem.<br /><br />Statham did a pretty good job reprising Charles Bronson's role of Arthur Bishop. However, I really couldn't believe Foster's portrayal of his character as much. I am not quite sure why, as I think Foster is a fine actor, but his performance just didn't seem to have the same ring to it as Jan Michael Vincent had in the original version. And although Donald Sutherland has a small part in this film, he played his role just fine.<br /><br />One thing that I did really like in this film was the way the portrayed the various gunfight scenes with empty handed combat skills. Very believable and some of it would actually be very effective. This made the movie much more enjoyable for those of us that are tired of all the Hollywood fight scenes that have no basis in reality.<br /><br />One particular plot point that I found very disturbing in the movie, which I won't detail here for fear of having a spoiler, but I will generalize in the fact that for Bishop to be a master hitman, he ends up making a very crucial error in judgment concerning evidence of a previous hit that ends up causing him difficulties in the end. In a nutshell, why would you go through all the trouble to commit a perfect murder and then take a picture of you with the dead body and then leave it lying around for someone to find. Not very smart!<br /><br />Overall I think this is a movie that is worth seeing, but for all of us Charles Bronson fans out there, you just can't beat the original!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.p to be a master hitman, he ends up making a very crucial error in judgment concerning evidence of a previous hit that ends up causing him difficulties in the end.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought these headphones because I was sick of using a cheap blue-tooth devices and wanted a set of nice headphones.  After doing much research (obviously not enough), I came across these headphones sold at a local retailer for eighty dollars.  They seemingly had all the features I was looking for and purchased them in hopes of many hours of enjoyment.  Little did I know how few hours of life the headphones had in them.      At first they worked exactly as advertised.  I mainly used them for my PS3, but also hooked them to my 360 occasionally.  I used them overall about a half-dozen times as I'm a very infrequent online gamer with select friends.  I used them without incident for a couple of months and then set them aside, not using them at all for a few months.      The other day I hooked them back up in hopes of playing with some friends online.  The very first thing I noticed was that the left speaker was crackling in & out.  I thought it was a loose connection and diligently checked all connections to the console to make sure it wasn't just an operator error, which it was not.  A few minutes later, I noticed that I had absolutely no sound from the left side at all and remained in this awful state since!  The headphones went from working perfectly a couple of months ago to now not working properly without any use at all.    So I went to the Turtle Beach website in hopes that my replacement due to a manufacturer defect would be handled quickly and promptly,  boy was I wrong!      The first thing I noticed was there was NO phone support whatsoever for Turtle Beach and I was at the mercy of only emailing support.  I jumped through all their hoops, scanning my original receipt, which I luckily kept and emailing them my address and phone number (how ironic they wanted my phone number, yet had no phone lines).  The very next thing I noticed was that my email took a VERY long time to receive an answer from support.     My situation finally was escalated to the RMA department.      As a side note, I should also mention that all of the emails that I mailed contained personalized questions about my situation and were only answered with very impersonal robotic responses. The agents handling my emails did not ONCE address my actual questions.  They just kept pushing me along the escalation ladder.      One of the questions that I posed in my email had to do with the fact that I did not see why I had to pay for shipping on a device that was clearly still under the year warranty.  It had been less than six months, well under their limited one-year warranty, and since the headphones had become unusable not due to any misuse or mishandling on part of the owner I believe the fault lies with the initial production at the factory.      I still have not received a response from the RMA department to my query and that was about two weeks ago.      I find it completely ridiculous that Turtle Beach expects me to pay for shipping the headphones back to their RMA department when the fault with the product clearly lies with the company. They issued a defective product and now will not stand behind their product to the extent of gaining back customer satisfaction.       I am writing this review in hopes that readers understand what they are getting into when choosing to purchase a product from this company and in hopes of making Turtle Beach change their policies with how they handle customer issues.      A professional company stands wholly behind their products with phone support lines, expedient responses and resolutions, and waiving return shipping fees due to faulty craftsmanship.  These above components spell ultimate customer satisfaction and because of lack in all areas, I am a very dissatisfied customer with this company.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|I really like Vampire movies. Especially if they have Kris Kristofferson. None of the Eclipse movies have Kris Kristofferson. Also, you can tell these vampires are all afraid of Wesley Snipes. That's probably why Wesley is in jail right now.    Based on these and other facts, two thumbs down.
0525423273|5.0|Gold Star Award Winner!<br /><br />ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is, without a doubt, one of my favorite books ever! Stephanie Perkins is a fabulous author and she created a romantic, fun, and addicting debut. Considering I visited Paris over the summer, this book was even more relevant because I recognized so many of the places Anna and her friends visited. Paris is a beautiful city and the perfect setting for any novel. It made me want to return as soon as possible, or even start attending a boarding school there!<br /><br />Anna Oliphant was an awesome main character. She was so realistic and believable, and best of all, she wasn't perfect. Anna was an ordinary teenager, and reading about her experiences was so much fun. She never failed to add humor to the story and I really wanted to know her in real life. Anna is one of those characters you can't help but like and want the best for and I was constantly rooting for her throughout the novel.<br /><br />Her family wasn't perfect, either, but I enjoyed reading about them. Her father especially. I always find it interesting when a character in a book is an author, and Mr. Oliphant was no exception. He reminded me of Nicholas Sparks in a way, or at least his books and movies did. Sean was a sweet younger brother and he really did love Anna. She had a lot of ups and downs with her friends in America, but I'm satisfied with how everything turned out.<br /><br />The characters that played the largest role in ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS were Anna's friends at the School of America in Paris. It was such an original idea to have Anna go to boarding school in Paris, and it made the story that much more magical and intriguing then if it was just in the US. All of the people Anna met in Paris made an impact on both Anna and the reader and I loved them all. Especially her best friends; Meredith, Rashmi, Josh, and St. Clair. They were a great group and each of them played a large role in the story, most importantly Etienne St. Clair.<br /><br />St. Clair deserves his own paragraph in this review- he is just that awesome. I loved his character and every page he was on. St. Clair was not your standard typical, gorgeous, popular guy, but rather a sweet and realistic character who adds so much to the story. I especially liked watching Anna and St. Clair's friendship grow and develop into something more.<br /><br />The setting and plot was also great. The idea of attending boarding school in Paris was so original and reading about all the places they visited and people they met was one of my favorite aspects of the novel. Another part of the story I liked was reading about Anna's love for movies, most especially old classics.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins wrote a magical and romantic first novel that will steal the hearts of readers everywhere and leave them dying to visit Paris. Anna and St. Clair were awesome main characters and the writing was fabulous. I can't wait to read Ms. Perkins' next release!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Kelsey Jonesragraph in this review- he is just that awesome. I loved his character and every page he was on.

B001LF347E|5.0|This show is FANTASTIC! It's got everything--humor, suspense, deep plots, magic, and legend. Plus, it's got great music and is family friendly. I've never been so entertained, satisfied, or addicted by a show. The actors are all excellent and skilled, each episode is like a mini movie and can be watched over and over again, and it's filmed at great locations. The graphics aren't as great as they could be, but they are good, and get better as the episodes/seasons go on, so I've noticed.<br /><br />Overall the show is flat-out spectacular!
B002ZG9940|1.0|I had to apologize to my wife for asking her to watch this film with me, instead of letting her want to go outside and wash her car.<br /><br />This movie was so slow and just didn't seem to go anywhere.  After the movie, I clicked on the bonus features section.  I wanted to see if the film maker offered any kind of verbal or printed apology for making us sit through this terrible movie.<br /><br />Not only did I have to waste nearly two hours of my precious time watching this lame movie, now I owe it to my wife that I'll have to wash her car for her, which will be my way of apologizing to her for wasting her time watching this lousy film with me.<br /><br />Boy, what a big disappointment!
B000BF0D9M|5.0|This guy can play, arrange and create great instrumentals and he also has some great vocals.  You'll love this cd if you like strings and drums and a little latin added in some of his songs.  We are looking out for his next tour in our area which we will not miss.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I find this whole album to be quite enjoyable.  \\"Windowpane\\" and \\"Hope Leaves\\" seem to get most of the attention but I find that \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\" and \\"Closure\\" are the better cuts and two of Opeth's most beautiful songs.  I very much like the heavy, intricate Opeth (as do the people on here who gave this album only 1 star) but I still find this album to be excellent.  To all those 1-star reviewers who can't handle any type of change or variety in life, all I have to say is thank god that every song on the planet is NOT death metal.  How boring would that be?  It would do my head in.  I dig death metal and like Akerfeldt's growl as much as the next guy, but I don't want to listen to that 24-7.<br /><br />Personally, I am glad Opeth took the chance to record something like this.  I think it came off quite well with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson co-producing it.  My only critique is that there are a few spots on the album where Akerfeldt hits the limits of his clean vocal range and misses a note or two.  I'm actually surprised they let these instances through to the final cut and didn't overdub them.  But despite that, I find this album to be eminently listenable, and give it 5 stars, and highly recommend it.<br /><br />No, it's not standard Opeth prog/death metal, and it's not straight death metal, and that's the whole point....

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Just a heads up to those who grew up on the Star Wars trilogy . .<br /><br />\\"Digitally Remastered\\" is the name given to twice re-cut classic films by George Lucas.  First, the theatrical releases of the \\"Special Edition Trilogy\\" from 1996 and 1997; including many edits, additional scenes, new digital characters, and alternate music.  Second, after the conclusion of the \\"Prequel\\" trilogy, George once again swapped characters and voices, and made further minor adjustments to create a \\"seamless\\" time-line for all 6 films.<br /><br />The argument is not about the quality of blu-ray over standard dvd, the issue is with the fact that 3 of the greatest movies of all time were perverted by their creator.  All signs point to Lucas working towards eliminating the original unaltered films from our consciousness.  Mind you, the edits by every-ones standards, other than Lucas, do not improve the films.<br /><br />I will forever prefer to watch even an old broken down VHS copy of the original trilogy than the most advanced version of this disgraceful \\"remastered\\" nonsense.<br /><br />Han shot first.<br /><br />Believe it.

B002BJGYU8|5.0|I found Gilmore Girls long after the show left it's first run.  What a pleasant surprise, to the point I can listen/ watch it over and over and still find things to discuss after I get thru the initial funny lines and fast talk.  It is smart, different and touches on so many levels of family  and friend dynamics .    At first it appears this is a story about a young girl growing up with a single mom, but you soon learn it is about the relationships of her mother, grandmother and all the slightly off kilter world of Stars Hollow.  Can't find many more talented cast than appears here on GG!
031603438X|5.0|First, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my order was delivered - way before the anticipated delivery dates range.  It was delivered while I was still on Christmas holiday vacation from work.  So I had plenty of time to sit down and read it, especially on those cold winter days and nights we experienced.  Same thing applies to this month's (January 2011) snow/ice storm, where I couldn't get into work for a day and one-half.<br /><br />I'd read previous biographies of the Rolling Stones in general, but it's really great to read directly from one of the band's more popular members on his points of view, regarding different subjects.  Also, as an amateur musician, I found it intriguing to read about his guitar playing discoveries, such as the open fifth.  I also liked reading about how some of the key Stones songs came about.<br /><br />In sum, Keith Richards comes across as a musician's musician.  He was never in it for the money, nor the drugs.  They were simply tools to keep himself going in the creative process.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to Rolling Stones fans, and to those of Keith Richards, in particular!  *****<br /><br />Kevin
B003ZK58WM|1.0|As much as I want to read this book I will not be paying such an outrageous price for Kindle version. How this can be more than the hardcover makes no sense. Kindle is going to have a hard time if this pricing continues.
044656740X|4.0|This book has some great stories, although some of them seem a little too well put together to be true, in my opinion.  It's still worth reading though as the stories have great lessons on ways for you to attract money and multiply it.  If you can read it with a grain of salt, take the good, and leave the rest, I think you'll get a lot out of it.  If you can deal with ego or arrogance, which is what I felt the book had a lot of, I think you'll get a lot out of it.  At the very worst, you'll walk away with another opinion on money, which you most likely won't find from anybody you associate with personally.  The way he thinks about money is rare, which he'd argue is why most people broke.  Worth reading, because it may be true for you.

0061537969|3.0|My personal experience of the book did not coincide with what I expected based on other reviews.  Uplifting is not a word I would use to describe the story - although the ending was somewhat more upbeat than what I expected after having read three quarters of the book.  It was well written in that it was an easy, quick read.  Also, the dog as narrator device is clever and was well done.  That aspect of the book was enjoyable and there are a few chuckles here and there.  Ultimately I don't regret reading it, but I don't think I will be recommending it to any of my friends.

0380730405|1.0|I read this book before I watched the movie.  I usually like reading books then watching the movie and almost always the book is better, but this time, the movie was so much better!  It's probably because I absolutely hated the book.  I read it as an assignment for my high school English class over 10 years ago.  I chose to read this because my teacher recommended it since I really liked Jane Eyre.  Ugh...bad idea!  I understand that we all have different tastes in books, so if a spineless, meek, and boring main character is something you'd like then you'd love the book.  I hated those qualities about her and the thing is, she never did get a backbone.  The book didn't even get interesting until 3/4 in. If I didn't have to read this book, i would've given up on it.  If you want to pass through all the boring parts, just watch the movie that was directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  You'll thank yourself for it.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|I bought this to flesh out my collection of blues music that I had already acquired from friends, purchases, etc.  I had previously looked for a box set that would open me to more than the usual suspects (Muddy, Wolf, Son House, Robert Johnson, etc) but not be limited to labels (like chess, etc).  I just happened to look on amazon one day and found this before it was even available.  I bought it as a pre-order and it arrived a week later.<br /><br />The songs and artists are varied but when there are over 50 cds and over 1,000 artists what else would you expect.  I have started to dig my way through this and I am very satisfied.  There are artists I had never heard of and those who I am very familiar with.  The songs are mixed with the songs you know (Big Mama Thornton - hound dog, T-Bone Walker - stormy monday, Jimmy Reed - ain't go you, etc) but they do a good job mixing it with songs you've never heard (little walter - blues with a feeling, elmore james t.v. mama, etc.).<br /><br />The sound quality varies but it's never horrible.  There is a minimal amount of static in some of the older artists but nothing unbearable.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.  It has provided me with a way to continue my learning of the blues - I'm only 30 - and get deeper than the mainstays of Muddy, Wolf, Buddy, and the Three Kings.  It's a joy to hear a song you've heard by someone else (example: Elvis sings \\"baby what you want me to do\\" on the '68 comeback but it was Jimmy Reed's song) and know where it originated from.  I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.
B00474IVGA|4.0|Country Strong was recently played in theaters. With amazing actors, actresses, and artists, like Gwyneth Paltrow, Tim McGraw, Leighton Meester, and Garrett Hedlund. The movie hit theaters January 7th 2011. I went to see this movie with a group of friends. Once the 1hr and 52 min. film ended all that I wanted to go home and do was go listen to country music. The music in this movie told a story.    ITunes released the album October 26th 2011. There are 13 tracks all of which consist of various artists. There are six songs from Garrett Hedlund, three tracks from Leighton Meester, two from Gwyneth Paltrow, and Faith Hill.   Hedlund starts the album off with a powerful cover of Merle Haggard's Silver Lining. Having listened to both versions of this song, I think that Garrett took a newer approach to the original song. Both their voice and background music are different. This delicate song becomes less soft with Garrett's raspy voice but is then brought back to its beauty with the great guitar in the background. All the songs that Garrett sings allow you to really feel what he is going though. You can feel the passion and dedication that went into his vocals. You almost feel as if he is right next to you and singing the song to you. Garrett lures the ears to listen and makes them never want to stop.   Faith Hill sings the song Give In To Me. The steady drumbeat in the background relaxes the mind. She starts the song very melancholy and gradually shows her vocal strength leading into the chorus. She sings with beauty and strength. Leighton Meester and Hedlund do a duet on this song. During this song you can feel the tension between the two artists and then hear them become comfortable and start to love one another. His raspy voice and her simple whispers conflate gloriously.   Gwyneth Paltrow's contribution to this sound track showed she singing skills. The instrumentals along with her elongated voice really make the song. The song Country Strong is probably the most powerful song on this album. It symbolizes all the southern folks out there and how the live. Their vigor characters shine in this song.   Having never really had an interest in country music, this album has come to make me infatuate the genre of country music. The instrumentals are so peaceful, on point, and flow with the artist's voices. The songs in this album bring you back home. The meanings behind the lyrics are easily relatable and that's what made this album so likable.    --By Samantha H.
B00015YVD6|4.0|I remember seeing this movie AT THE MOVIES - yes I'm THAT old !!<br /><br />It was showing on the television one Sunday afternoon and my daughter was entranced! She kicked and screamed up a fuss when the ads came on. She just stared and stared at Madison the mermaid (Daryl Hannah) so I thought I'd look around to see if it was on DVD. I thought I'd find it in bargain bins at local department stores but to no avail. When I saw it here and at such a cheap price, I snapped it up.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the price and it was delivered in next to no time at all.<br /><br />Suffice to say, this movie is my daughter's obsession! She has now developed a love of all things mermaid.<br /><br />And a note to any parents - this movie is perfect for young children. There are no sex scenes, no swearing, no violence. It's just a fun movie with some sad bits and happy bits complete with a happy ending.<br /><br />A lovely film that my 3 year old daughter watches again and again and again.
B003XOAJ6K|5.0|Overall the packaging is great, a nice collector's box, beautiful art (not cheap) cds/dvds are in a cardboard sleeve (each) and has nice collector's cards to go with it as well as a poster. Nice to collect, even if i'm not in the slighest way tempted to put it on my wall lol. I knew a few women back in the 80s who would have killed for these posters though. I should say girls as I was still in H.S. at the time. Overall the quality of the release is great, no complaints, I am not the kind of person who really followed duran duran, except what I heard on the radio or when I started getting into the album cuts. this (along with Notorious) were my two favorite duran duran albums back in the day. It was when I stopped seeing them as mtv pretty boys (because all the girls back then loved them as I guess to them they were cute) and realised they had some seriously great material. I loved the songs on Seven and the Ragged Tiger too (so please DD fans don't hurt me) but it was the two albums I mentioned that really got me started, and the reason why I am paying more for these collector's boxes. I was hesitant at first, but after I got them I am pleased (and ordered a few more...I think there are five of these out there right now...remastered etc) I do not know what cuts didn't make the bonus cd (I didn't start collecting their singles until about the Wedding Album) So I do not know of any mixes or b-sides that are left off (though they do seem pretty coplete) and having the bonus dvd of live material as well as the companion videos for the album make this a must have, and a collector's dream. As a male I didn't really care how cute they were lol, but their videos at times were pretty good, very visual, very conceptual. So seeing them now, with a more descerning eye makes them even better. As I am distanced from their public persona and therefore am only really judging them by the quality of their music/performances/videos. My only qualm about these editions (which actually puzzles me) is how can a set this beautifull put together not include the lyrics? I personally feel if people are gonna reissue/remaster cds they should have complete lyrics, but I'm a picky collector. While the lack of lyrics is a definite downer for me, I still would greatly reccomend getting this reissues/remasters. They are beautifully packaged and sound great. If you are a fan or duran duran or a fan of the 80s these albums are a must have anyway so treat yourself and splurge a little and get these rather well made/expanded editions. You'll absolutely love them.
B001SS3JS8|5.0|Jodi Picoult released her bestselling book, The Pact, in 1998. Along with this book, some of Jodi's other best sellers include, Nineteen Minutes, My sister's Keeper, The Tenth Circle, and many others.  Nineteen Minutes was her first book to debut as #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list. Her second novel to make it up was Change of Heart. The Pact was made into a Lifetime original movie in 2002, starring, Megan Mullally, Eric Lively, and Meghann Henderson. The Pact was published by Allen & Unwin in 1998. Along with this book, Allen & Unwin published the works of J.R. R. Tolkien.    Set in Bainbridge, New Hampshire, in a bedroom community, the Gold's move in to their new house. He Harte's having already been living there, welcome them with open arms. Michael and Melanie Gold become best friends with James and Augusta, or affectionately referred to as Gus. The Gold's have a baby girl named Emily and the Harte's have a son around the same age named Chris. Both families are young and just starting out. Because the parents were so close, it was just expected of Emily and Chris to be together, and it put a lot of pressure on them. With new, young love blossoming, the tone starts becoming hopeful.   Chris and Emily have been as close as siblings since birth. As they grew up, a romance blossomed. They do everything together, and everyone sees them as the perfect couple. Unknown to the rest of the world, Emily was having inner struggles. As children, Chris dared Emily to go into the men's bathroom. Unbeknownst to him, she was molested. Because of this, she forever is traumatized. Emily discovers she's pregnant with Chris's baby, but she doesn't tell him because she knows he will marry her and help her take care of it, which I exactly what she doesn't want. She wants to go to college along with worried about bringing her family shame by announcing the pregnancy. She went in to have an abortion, but didn't follow through with it because the nurse doing the procedure was male, bringing flashbacks of her molestation. Consequently, all these events made Emily suicidal.   The police and detectives find out that it was Chris who fatally shot her. Not only did the cruel act end a life, it also ended a friendship. How could you still be friends with the parents to your daughters' killer? Word then gets out that there was a suicide pact that didn't get fulfilled, leading everyone to believe that Chris is unstable and has to be watched. They go to court and Chris is tried. The final verdict is not guilty, because of evidence found later.   Anyone in age ranging from young adult to adult, who likes suspenseful, riveting novels, would really enjoy this book. You should read this book if you enjoy timeless love stories that aren't mushy. This book is also kind of like a mystery, because throughout the story, clues are given to help piece the puzzle together. I liked it because it didn't have a predictable ending. I would highly recommend this book because it's compelling, suspenseful, and a story of two teenagers just trying to figure out their place in this world.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. The way Suzanne Collins tells an action packed story without over indulging in detail but still painting a vivid picture is perfect. Im looking forward to the sequel and her other series as well.

0307386171|5.0|Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach describes what can happen when two young people with little sexual experience and different desires marry without expressing their needs.<br /><br />Explosively Subtle<br />- I guess you could call me a McEwan groupie- I adore his subtle, meaningful prose. He says so much without going overboard (but not in an annoying Hemingway-esque type of style).<br />- McEwan takes one small event, one that is broadcasted on billboards in this day and age, and makes it so meaningful and life-changing.<br />- If someone were to tell me exactly what this novel is about (issues consummating a marriage, shall we say) I'd think it would have the potential to be crude or silly. McEwan's talent prohibits either.<br />- You end up feeling for both characters and appreciating the historical context of their situation, just a few years shy of the sexual revolution.<br /><br />Protect Yourself<br />- If you're squeamish about sex and it's by-products this may not be for you.<br />- There is definitely a plot, but it's not plot driven, as the characters' thoughts and feelings really drive the text.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Although the premise of the book is very sad, the reality of the story kept me reading.  This was a very easy read as it switched back and forth each chapter between the 2 storytellers.

0061777250|5.0|I heard about this book while I was listening to Coast To Coast AM one night.  The host of that show stated that it was the most comprehensive and well researched book to date, on the subject of life after death.  Well, I have to say, this book really changed my perspective.<br /><br />I always hoped that there was life after death, because who wants to \\"poof\\" into dust, in the end.  But this book proves, without a doubt that there IS another life, after this one.  It presents documented cases of people all over the world, who died and came back to tell the world that life does go on, even when the human body stops functioning.  The author even presents medical information that helps clarify the fact that we don't end, when the body does.<br /><br />I, for one, feel that this book helps to destroy the fear that many people have, about death.  When you realize that you're not dead, and that you really can't ever die, then what is there to fear?  I loved this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who was searching for the meaning of their existance.<br /><br />(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|In this movie he acted and directed roles he has definitely steadily grown into over the years. Admittedly I have never seen him as an action hero firstly but in this endeavor he has done job. Great plot and great acting. Lots of action and even some laughter go.

030746363X|5.0|The bottom line is that Tim does what Tim does and that is spell out for anyone to see some basic principles to get what you want/need. Whether it's your dream job, life or that perfect body, Time lets you know some simple approaches to get there. My favorite part is that he wants you to read the information and take what you need. There's no BS here, just facts and he suggests you try them for yourself. Ultimately people, you get what you put into it. This book serves as a great reference manual, so add it to your library and pull out what you need when you need it.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|A classic book. Bought this book for my son and he loved it. Robert Louis Stevenson is an excellent writer .
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I expected to love this prior to viewing as I am a Diane Lane fan and I can still for the most part count on Disney for a inspirational movie not drenched with sex and violence.  I was not disappointed.  Outstanding cast, inspirational, and no need to worry about your children being exposed to something that adults should not have to witness.  When is the last time anyone could say that??  I highly,  HIGHLY recommend.
0307454541|5.0|I picked up the first book while traveling to Hawaii and when I returned I got the second and the minute I finised it I had to buy the third (still  in hardback). Although a little violent, I really loved the protagonist. What a shame this author's life has been cut short. This trilogy was a delightful diversion that I could not put down.
B002ZG981E|3.0|The 2010 film \\"Inception\\" is filled with great photography and clever camera tricks.  If there were anything about the characters or story that I cared about, I'm certain I would like it more.
0756405890|2.0|I bought this book because of its great reviews. That was a lesson on how not to trust reviews that much any more.  The book is not that bad in the beggining, but it's getting worse page after page and, after a while, I just couldn't be bothered to read it.  I just dont understand why so many people have rated it with 5 stars.  The only reason I'm writing this is to try to prevent others from making the same bad choice as I have.  Thank you for your time and patience reading this.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I read all the Twilight books, and have seen the movies (Hooked), then started watching True Blood (Hooked) I could not start another love of Vampires again, I gave this show a shot.....it took me a few eposides and I have to say I am sooooo hooked. What a cast, this is the first time I have to say that I have loved an entire cast of a show, ALL OF THEM. I also love the loyal, god guy to these vampire shows, Edward, Bill and now Stephen (oh my god) could he get any better looking......these brothers are super hot and the acting I think is amazing. I have decided I know longer want to be a Princess, I want to be a vampire.....
B004DK5CW4|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while, it follows Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) in pursuing her fathers horse ranch by putting all her stakes on one horse that would soon be a legend, Secretariat. The passing of her father drives Penny to square against ,lawyers, big business men, and her family to hold true to her fathers honor, and the horse was right there with her.    As far as the story line goes, it is hard to go wrong with one of the most riveting event in U.S. history, one that the whole nation followed, one that has set records that haven't even been approached to this day.    Even though you know it is fake, it is still exciting to watch a horse beat another record breaking horse by thirty one lengths, more exciting that a neck and neck race. truly an inspiring movie and John Malkovich was brilliant (as was the rest of the cast.)

B000002I69|5.0|Absolutely awesome. This is a compilation of live tracks from several performances in Europe during the fall of 1972 while on a Newport Jazz Festival tour. In case you have forgotten. Dave disbanded his quartet during 1967 after 17 years of performing. George Wein producer of the Newport Jazz Festival and the U.S. State Department asked Dave if he would reform his group and go on the road. My only criticism is that this should be at least a two-disc album.<br /><br />Dave Brubeck on piano is accompanied by Paul Desmond on alto saxophone, Gerry Mulligan on baritone saxophone, Jack Six on bass, and Alan Dawson on drums. Every track is great. Expanding the group to a quintet with the addition of Gerry Mulligan is wonderful. Gerry and Paul really swing.<br /><br />Truth (10:20) and Unfinished Woman (7:20), the first two tracks, were recorded during 4 November 1972 at the Philharmonic in Berlin. Truth is an improvisational adaptation of the orotario \\"Truth from Planets Are Spinning.\\" But, this is a very creative interpretation with Dave playing complex time signatures which are enhanced by Alan Dawson's spectacular percussion accents. Jack Six plays a great bass solo. Incidentally, Jack played on the premiere performance of the original orotario. This was and remains \\"swinging jazz.\\"<br /><br />Unfinished Woman was written by Gerry Mulligan. It features Gerry and Paul playing counterpoint comments while Dave plays a syncopated riff.<br /><br />Koto Song (5:05) was recorded during 26 October 1972 at the famous Olympia Theater in Paris. It is a light blues tune heavily influenced by the koto, a Japanese classical instrument Dave heard in Kyoto, Japan. Koto Song was first played by the old quartet on the \\"Jazz Impressions of Japan\\" album and a live version recorded in Germany during 1966 was released on the \\"Brubeck Summit Sessions\\" album. But, this is probably the best version and features Paul Desmond's elegant, sinuous melodic lines. Gerry Mulligan does not play on thistrack.<br /><br />If you are unsure whether to purchase this album, track four alone is reason to buy. It, like tracks one and two, was recorded during 4 November 1972 in Berlin. This is a spectacular 16 minute version of Take Five, which was first released during January 1960 on the Time Out album. Alan Dawson is awesome on drums and needless to say the audience loved the performance. You may think that Dave had tired of playing this song but he said after the concert: \\"We really still enjoy playing it and you heard what kind of audience reaction it still receives.\\" You will play this many, many times.<br /><br />Rotterdam Blues (6:45) and Sweet Georgia Brown (1:00), the last two album tracks were recorded during 28 October 1972 at De Doelen in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Of all the concert performances, this was the most wildly received and the crowd made the group play several encores lasting more than 40 minutes. Unfortunately, we don't get to hear them. Rotterdam Blues begins with Dave playing solo and then the rhythm and horn sections come in later. It features some terrific blues solos. This is a real swinging blues tune with every musician totally in the groove. The final encore tune is Dave playing a solo chorus of Sweet Georgia Brown. Dave later said: \\"I don't know how it happened to come to mind. I probably hadn't played this tune since my trio days over twenty years earlier.\\"<br /><br />Remember, this was during late 1972. Nixon was president. The \\"Iron Curtain\\" was reality. Germany was divided into East and West by the Berlin Wall. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia were all occupied or controlled by the Soviet Union. The United States was in the final stage of withdrawing soldiers from Viet-Nam. Times were changing and as usual Dave and his group were in the forefront. This was an important concert tour and remains a great album.

B0015DROBO|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]<br /><br />When this book was recommended, I was warned that it was a translation; however, it translates beautifully.  Once one accepts that remembering every name & location as written will be difficult.  In my case, many of the first names were easily associated with English first names, but the towns & locations other than Stockholm or somewhere very familiar were different.  In those cases, I simply connected the town where certain events were taking place & slid over the exact spelling & possible pronunciation.<br /><br />The book itself is riviting, & I wanted to read constantly.  I anxiously awaited the next chapter or event.  These are long books...no 200 pages here, but I read this first of the trilogy in two days which meant for me reading every extra moment as well as late into the night!<br /><br />I plan to re-read the entire trilogy in a few months curious if I get more of the detail out of the writing.  I highly recommend this book, & this book can stand on its own if one chooses not to read the entire trilogy, but I think you will download the other two books before finishing the first!
0802114970|4.0|This book is quite interesting and gives a great overview of the reign of Henry VIII and the story of his wives. Being a typical female, I was more interested in learning about the wives and his relationship with each one. I was a little bored when the political/military passages went on for too long. However, you need to know the history of that time within the context of the story of the wives to really get the full effect. This book is chock-full of interesting trivia and tidbits. Henry VIII was so completely misguided and evil; it is so intriguing as well as horrifying to read in detail about how he treated his wives and anyone else who dared to cross him. It's not as gripping as a really great novel by your favorite author, but you learn a ton reading this book so the educational/enlightenment factor is high and defintely makes it worth your time.
031603438X|4.0|\\"Life\\" was quite a ride. I'm not, honestly, that familiar with the work of the Rolling Stones, nor with the rock 'n' roll scene in general. I enjoy hearing the band occasionally, when there's one of their more familiar tunes playing on the radio. But I am not a regular nor a particularly enthusiastic listener, and I would likely not even have picked up this book had it not been so widely praised.<br /><br />I can see why. Despite its length, it does speed along through the years at a nifty pace, in a colorful, effortless romp of language that combines the musician's idiom with a kind of cocky, irreverential Brit-talk that you hear in a Monty Python episode. The narrative, I'm sure, is told orally by Richards and transcribed (by co-writer James Fox) with all its rough edges, non sequiturs and profanities intact--all of which makes for refreshingly salty prose. It's fun to read.<br /><br />For full review, go to [...]
B002JVWQSW|2.0|I'm at a loss here. I truly cannot understand why people like this series. It abounds in cliches and silliness. The characters behave absolutely stupidly, according to their pre-determined character guidelines. There are no surprises. I expect one of two things in a series: either the unexpected to capture my interest in what could happen next, or a reflection of real life, so that I can laugh at how the writers captured the real thing. There is neither in this series.

0446195529|2.0|As I read Hell's Corner, David Baldacci's latest mini-epic about how the men and woman of the D.C. Camel Club save civilization from itself, I was reminded of the effort needed to wring a cloth dry: twisting, twisting, until no drop of water can be seen. Alas, with this venture the Camel Club has been wrung dry.    I liked the conceit of the Camel Club when it was first introduced - several men with disparate backgrounds and skills who complement one another and who are dedicated to revealing corruption and wrong-doing in the government. Even after the group was expanded to include a female master (mistress?) thief who pulls off a casino heist with the Club's help it remained interesting. I particularly liked how Baldacci brought the arena of rare books and the Library of Congress into the plots.    In Hell's Corner, however, I feel he's taken everything too far. The Club is now linked to a prominent retired British spymaster and a gorgeous (of course) MI6 female operative. Oliver Stone, the Club's reluctant leader and freedom fighter (and retired assassin, who can apparently recuperate overnight from injuries that would fell even Sylvester Stallone), has joined the battle only because the President, whom he doesn't respect, has waved the flag and ordered/pleaded with him to help. As added frosting on the cake, shady Russian and Mexican opponents are dragged in as well.    Yes, Hell's Corner is an overly complicated, overly brutal, overly dramatic, unbelievable test of the imagination and simply leaves the reader exhausted and shaking his/her head. Maybe it's me, but I'm very tired of novels that revolve around massive sub rosa government conspiracies that manage to flourish until one - and usually only one - brave opponent appears.
B0045MRQS8|5.0|Simply stunning vocals, subtle yet powerful guitar solos, melody and chorus galore! This album is a contemporary work of art for it's genre. Almost every track is spot on. IMO, just one weak link on the record. If you like bands such as Journey, Foreigner etc this release is not to be missed. Did I mention that it features the greatest transsexual vocalist ever to walk the planet? The former Mark...now MARCIE Free. No joke folks.
1907360212|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

0345409671|2.0|If you hate sentences that makes no sense unless you read them more than three times, this book is not for you.<br /><br />Ann Rice has quite a taste of using participles in the sentences, and by that, I mean A LOT of participles. The prose is beautiful to some level, but with trying to do too much in one sentence, it makes a very frustrating read instead of an enjoyable one. In many instances, the point of the sentence is lost after thirty words through it, if not before. After that, it's all participles, participles, and more participles, and then, more often than not, even more participles. In this book, you will find a sentence that contains over two hundred words, spanning over a half of the page on its own. If you can stomach sentences such as these, this is a very good book.<br /><br />Now, the good. Once again Ann Rice has done a very good job. She has shown us God in a different light. Interesting and convincing. Fans might not like it, though. If they're looking for an adventure like The Vampire Lestat, they might be disappointed, since this is more about how one views God and the world, instead of a quest to find out some big historical secret. This book is more about Creation and cosmology rather than a vampire's adventure. I find it an enjoyable read, except for its gobbledygook and a bore at the beginning where almost nothing was going on, and nothing seemed to proceed the story. Its cosmology alone is enough to make this book enjoyable.
1904633358|5.0|Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person. \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" shows off Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories involving Holmes, mingling human psychology with sometimes bizarre mysteries.<br /><br />Holmes is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man who was hired by the mysterious Red-Headed League, and given a strange job... which is somehow connected to a criminal undertaking.<br /><br />Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a missing fiance, a strange murder in Boscombe Valley, a dead man who was sent five orange seeds, a woman whose husband has utterly vanished, a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey, a dead woman whose last words were \\"it was the band, the speckled band!\\", a young engineer given a dream job, an American heiress who vanishes directly after her wedding, a broken beryl coronet, and a young woman given a surreally weird job.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:<br />1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.<br />2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.<br /><br />There are plenty of both kinds in \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" with a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery or counterfeiting ring. Doyle's stately, dignified prose is heightened by moments of excitement or horror (\\" It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek\\"), and he wove in a lot of human psychology into Holmes' cases.<br /><br />Holmes himself... is Holmes. Doyle didn't like his detective much, but Sherlock's knife-edged intellect and fascination with puzzles are strangely hypnotic -- even if you wouldn't like to be roomies with the guy, it would be amazing just to sit and watch him work.

1440419043|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen masterfully tells this story which helps the reader engage in the relationships of people. Like her earlier compelling novel, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice is a romance story. Although there are many different printings of this work, T. Egerton, Whitehall first published it in January 28th 1813 with roughly 370 pages. While the original print did not have illustrations the first wonderful pictures were by Pickering & Greatbatch.<br />Pride and Prejudice owes much of its popularity to its vivid portrayal of character. The story is set in early 19th-century England, a trying time for any unmarried maiden.  Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Benett sister, was as open as a closed book shielding her true feelings. While Mr. Darcy would proudly separate himself from the common folk. Both characters are very likable despite their flaws.<br /><br />  This pleasurable tale begins with the worries of a caring mother. Back then it was incredibly important for women to get married and none of her five daughters had. Thankfully a young bachelor by they name of Mr. Bingley came to town and was immediately attracted to the oldest Benett sister, Jane. Elizabeth on the other hand was somewhat fond of Mr. Darcy but he seemed to show no interest. Although Jane and Mr. Bingley had grown quite close, he left along with the rest of his party leaving a brokenhearted Jane behind. Elizabeth found out that Mr. Darcy was the one who convinced Mr. Bingley to go. While she was visiting at a friend's house she and Mr. Darcy crossed paths and he tried to propose to her. Still upset that he had broken up Mr. Bingley and her sister she declined the proposal.<br /><br />  After a heated argument with Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth saw eye to eye with him and realized they had both been prejudice and maybe a little proud. Fortuitously, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy both moved back to town were they showed up to the Benett's house and had a somewhat awkward conversation. Later Mr. Bingley, who arrived alone, asked if he could speak to Jane apart from the other. A proposal maybe? If that wasn't enough to fill the mind of Elizabeth, knowing she thinks of Mr. Darcy differently would.<br /><br />  Interestingly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both recognized that they were prideful and prejudice. Which hints to why the title is call Pride and Prejudice. They're imperfect characters, and that's what people like about them! When I was reading this book I realized what made it different from other romance novels is that the love unfolded gradually. At some points in the book it seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. A lot of stories now a days quickly get to the point, forgetting that telling the story is the best part.

1594202842|4.0|I actually found the book to be fascinating. It is a well-written book and I enjoyed it immensely. Amy Chua was unapologetic and [most likely] honest about the way she is raising her kids.  Although I do not agree with her methods, for those with similar goals, her extreme ways seem to be effective (not to say that there is no down-side).  The book has given me an inside look into a world I am totally unfamiliar with...
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I built a machine and used the stock Intel CPU cooler that was included. Using Real Temp to measure the CPU temperature, it turns out my Intel Core I7 950 3.07ghz processor was idling at 70C and reaching the TJ Max 100C under load (which was causing performance to be throttled to avoid chip damage).  Not good.    After looking around a bit here and on Newegg, I settled on this CPU cooler because it was affordable, the reviews looked good, and a friend recommended it. After installing it, my current CPU temperatures are 41-44C idle and 63C under heavy load. I'm not really sure what the optimal temp for my CPU is, but that's a huge improvement to say the least!    Installation was relatively simple, but you will have to take out the mobo to mount the bracket underneath. Some mentioned that the heatsink moves around even after being secured to the CPU. I found this to be true as well, but as long as you're not opening up your case and bumping it every day, I don't see this as being a major concern. Also, just be aware that this is pretty tall, so you'll want to check the dimensions of your case before purchasing.     Bottom line, I'd definitely recommend this.    Note: Used [[ASIN:B000BSLU2S Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound 3.5g]] instead of the included thermal grease. I don't honestly know what the difference is, but from what I hear it's the best. That, and if you're already going to spend $300 on a CPU, might as well spend $7 more to make sure it gets cooled properly.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I LOVE these wall decals!!!!!  I searched in stores for wall decals and these were better than what I could find in stores!  They match the border perfectly and were so easy to put up!  I loved being able to re-position the wall decals if needed.  They look AWESOME!  They stuck to the wall without any issues.  My daughter had similar decals in her nursery for 3 years with no problems.  So excited about my daughter's princess room!
B004ECFW94|5.0|I saw this performance in the theatre a few months ago.  I felt the production was extremely powerful so unless they have botched the DVD, I can't wait to see it again.     Since one reviewer bashed Placido Domingo, I have to say that after the first few measures in which Domingo sounded much more like a tenor than baritone, he became increasingly credible in the role.  Theatrically, this was effective because Boccanegra ages tremendously in this opera.      It's interesting to compare Don Carlo to Boccanegra, two recent Met HD broadcasts, because the entire Don Carlo opera, a very big and long opera, takes place in a very short span of time.  It's unclear exactly how long that span is, but historically, the end of the war/wedding/death of Carlos were all in the same year.  That creates a different kind of theatrical intensity.    Boccanegra spans such a long period of time that it almost loses its coherence here and there, but this production was amazing.  I was so moved by the majesty and nobility and musicality that I will buy this DVD even if ten more people give it low ratings.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|This EP is worthless.  They don't even try here.  The one song that was actually good on this album was released on the iTunes and Japanese edition of Perfect Symmetry (My Shadow).  The rest of it is made up of filler, j-pop, rap remixes, and to cap it off they ripped off the theme song to the Rocky movies.  But let's go through each song individually to pinpoint the problems.    1.  House Of Lights:  This is complete filler put in just to get the EP above 30 minutes in running time.  I have to say though that between the .40 second mark until the end it had what could have been a great buildup to an epic song.  Instead they fade it out at the 1.23 mark and go on to the only Keane song that is actually new.    2.  Back In Time:  New however doesn't mean good.  This sounds more like a rejected song from Perfect Symmetry than something completely original.  He also says the same line over, and over, and over, and over.... ad nauseam.  Add to it completely forgettable lyrics and a horrible grating synth and you realize it should have been thrown in the trash never to be heard from.    3.  Stop For A Minute:  The big single.  The song that supposedly 'modernizes' the band.  The song that made a total of 12 teenage girls wet their panties when they first heard it on Radio Disney.  The same girls who are now telling the old fans to just 'get over it' and accept this 'new' direction.  It isn't even a FEAT: K'naan song.  It's more like a rapper trying to show his soft side by letting Keane in to explain the wussy parts he'd rather not rap.  Yes the song is catchy but so is 'Banana Phone' and we don't laud praises over it's rhythmic quality.    4.  Clear Skies:  This song just doesn't belong.  It belongs on the back half of the fan album of Keane, 'Little Broken Words'.  It sounds like their work from the late 90's to early 2000's.  This isn't new or different.  Just a retread of the stuff that failed to become popular before Dominic Scott left the band.    5.  Ishin Denshin(You've Got To Help Yourself):  I don't get it.  What is a Japanese singer doing on a Keane album in the first place?  And she doesn't even sing in English?  Then you've got an annoying chorus that Tom sings which is mind-numbingly boring and insipid.  What is the point?  It almost feels like a cross-promotional song that wants people in the UK and America to know who Tigarah is and bought off Keane to include this song with a edited in chorus by Keane to make it look like it was their idea.    6.  Your Love:  This isn't even sung by Tom.  I don't know who this is but it sure isn't the voice of Keane.  Maybe they think people won't notice if they squeeze it in between the two worst songs on the EP?  It isn't a bad song but I paid for a Keane EP to hear Keane not to hear someone who kind of sounds like them.    7.  Looking Back:  Oh, God.  I didn't even remember how the Rocky theme went until this came on.  Were they really that lazy that they couldn't make even a half-hearted attempt at creating music?  They had to steal from the Rocky theme?  Add that to the goddamned rapping remix K'naan did to the it and this is an absolute disaster of a song.    8.  My Shadow:  Thank you!  Thank you!  Finally a Keane song that actually resembles Keane!  It doesn't matter though as I said at the beginning this song came out on the iTunes edition so this isn't even new.  Still if it weren't on this wretched excuse for an EP, I believe this song could have been compared to (I believe) their best song ever 'Fly To Me'.    So really you got 6 new songs.  1 sung in Japanese.  Two rap remixes by a bad rapper. 1 song that isn't even sung by Keane.  1 rehash of their beginning work and a rejected synth-pop song from Perfect Symmetry.  Hope you enjoyed your attempt at experimentation Keane!  This is one fan who is never buying another album from you until you finally listen to the fans who got you where you are in the first place!

1594202842|4.0|I read this book after having heard about it on NPR, facebook, the New York Times, and about ten or fifteen blogs.  It inspired so many interesting and varied opinions that I decided to go straight to the source and find out for myself just what Amy Chua was saying.<br />I found the writing style in this book to be very readable, fast paced, and interesting.  Chua has a self-deprecating wit and verve that makes her extremely fascinating in both a likable and frightening way.  I imagine she is a very magnetic person.  She is easy to read and I finished the book in only a few short hours.  I didn't find it earth-shakingly literary, but I am sure that's not what she was going for.<br />As to the story itself, I found it very well-paced.  She wrote a short memoir about parenting her two daughters, emphasizing their music education.  I am sure there is much more to her life with her children than is told, but I believe that Chua very carefully selected a more limited scope of her parenting to emphasize the conflicts she had with her daughter, Lulu, and the way she learned to back away from some of her more extreme parenting.<br />As for the controversy this book has provoked...I think it is telling that reviews are so polarized--most readers on amazon gave it either a one star or a five star review, with very few people in between.  People seem to think that Chua is either a monster or a genius, a woman who learned her lesson, or a woman boasting about her successful children.<br />I believe she is neither.  She is a mother.  And, like most parents, Western or Chinese, she made mistakes in her attempt to genuinely parent her children in the way she thought best.  I don't agree that name-calling is going to yield results.  Or that forced six hour daily practice sessions on an instrument are helpful to a child's development.  But I do believe that children should be held to high standards.  I do believe in parental involvement.  And I do believe in structure and scheduling for your children, although I am a proponent of a much more relaxed structure than Chua's.<br />My one major argument with her is that I don't think she explained the fact that she was using broad, sweeping generalizations about cultures (Western, Chinese) very well.  She admits that she is using generalizations, but she does not explain where these came from or why she held/holds these views.<br />Overall, though, I found the book to be a good read, and I hope more people will read it without judging it first based on the controversy.children, although I am a proponent of a much more relaxed structure than Chua's.

B0028DRGDQ|5.0|A fluff news show reporter, Angela [Manuela Velasco] and her cameraman, Pablo [Pablo Rosso] stumble into a serious news story when they do a ride-along with a local firefighting crew. The crew believes they have been called out because an elderly woman has fallen, but when they arrive, they discover something terrible; the residents of the apartment complex are becoming infected with a disease that makes them terrifyingly aggressive, with a taste for human flesh. Shot entirely from the point of view of the cameraman, [REC] is a risky experimental zombie flick that pays off with riveting terror. It supplies an all too plausible beginning to a viral apocalypse.<br /><br />The US remake, Quarantine, is good, too, but is almost a shot-by-shot redo of [REC]. My advice is to see the original.
0679420266|1.0|I love this book.  I have read several translations of The Stranger.  But I returned this copy the same day it arrived in the mail.  This translation by Matthew Ward, for the Everyman's Library, is the absolute WORST translation of The Stranger I've ever read.  It takes all of the teeth out of Camus' masterpiece. It makes the book into a sloppy, uninteresting mess of colloquial language.  It completely obfuscates the meaning, it gives the narrator an unintelligent and boing voice, and it doesn't even \\"Americanize\\" the narrator (which is this translation's claim to fame).  Just consider a comparison of the opening sentences.  The Matthew Ward translation:<br /><br />  \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: 'Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday. The old people's home is at Marengo, about eighty kilometers from Algiers.\\"<br /><br />And the far superior Stuart Gilbert translation:<br /><br />  \\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.\\" The Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers.\\"<br /><br />How is the Ward translation (the Everyman's Library translation) Americanized?  In what regional dialect of America are mothers referred to as \\"Maman\\"???  None that I have ever heard.  Or the sentence \\"That doesn't mean anything.\\"  It's completely ambiguous.  What doesn't mean anything?  What are you even talking about?  Next, compare the last sentences of Part I, this translation:<br /><br />  \\"Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.\\"<br /><br />to the Gilbert translation:<br /><br />  \\"But I fired four shots more into the inert body, on which they left no visible trace. And each successive shot was another loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing. \\"<br /><br />Compare the grand \\"loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing\\" to the spineless \\"knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.\\"  Matthew Ward probably never got past high school French.  The list of passages that are mangled by Ward goes on and on...  This translation suffers terribly from its translator.  This translation doesn't do Camus justice.  Don't get this translation - get ANY translation besides Matthew Ward's.<br /><br />Otherwise you'll be left with the impression that Camus was as bad a writer, and that The Stranger is as bad a novel, as Matthew Ward is a translator.hey left no visible trace.

B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Five people get on an elevator, in a building from which a man has just jumped, saying that he can hear the devil's footsteps approaching. When the elevator stops between floors, the five soon begin to succumb to bizarre accidents and their own paranoia. Only one security guard knows what is really going on--the devil amongst them, taking their souls for their sins. Can Detective Bowden [Chris Messina] get them out before the carnage goes further, and will he believe what he sees?<br /><br />Devil is a quiet horror film, like all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies (though he is only the writer in this case). A simple tale of good and evil, and redemption. It plays well because the script is tight and the acting excellent, but most of all because we want the story to be true. We want there to be a devil, because we want to believe in redemption and just deserts. We want there to be more than this world, and Devil gives us a compelling peek beyond.

1599218011|4.0|I will start by saying that I am a huge fan of Kris Carr. I have seen her documentary, read one of her previous books and regularly read her blog. She is truly an inspiration for people who are dealing with serious diseases or for those who are interested in prevention. Prevention is the main reason why I became vegan more than 2 years ago. My diet evolved over time and books like Crazy Sexy Diet encourage me to keep it clean and stick to whole foods.<br /><br />If you or your loved one suffers from a chronic disease, you may find this book especially useful or even lifesaving. The lifestyle described in this book can help in many situations when a patient finds the course of action suggested by his or her doctor unacceptable. Or in situations where medicine cannot offer any relief.<br /><br />Although this appears to be a well researched book, I have to point out some factual errors that a Registered Dietitian proofreading this book should have noticed. In her acknowledgments, Kris mentioned that Jennifer Reilly, RD did so; however, that does not appear to be sufficient.<br /><br />-on page 168, she states that B12 in the form of methylcobalamin is absorbed best. In fact, cyanocobalamin is absorbed better that methylcobalamin. This is significant because 1000 mcg of cyanocobalamin can be taken twice a week, while methylcobalamin in the same dose will have to be taken daily. It is important for vegans to know this distinction to avoid deficiency.<br /><br />-on pages 73-75, Lilli B. Link, MD suggests that it is not necessary to take 1000 mg of calcium. She invokes a study that looked at raw foodists and another epidemiological study. She also continues to promote the theory that consumption of too much protein is a significant factor in the development of osteoporosis. This theory is slowly being discredited with newer studies that have been coming out and that have analyzed this relationship. She also fails to mention some cross-sectional studies that showed that vegans may be at a higher risk for osteoporosis-related fractures because of lower calcium intake. One of the examples is the EPIC study where vegans had 30% higher fracture rate than vegetarians, fish eaters and meat eaters. Vegan RDs: Jack Norris and Virginia Messina discuss this topic in detail on their blogs and the website veganhealth.org. They conclude that there is no reason to believe that vegan diet prevents osteoporosis or that vegans need less calcium that everybody else. Brenda Davis, RD and Vesanto Melina, RD, both of whom are vegans, agree on this point as demonstrated in their book \\"Becoming Vegan\\". So if you are a vegan, it makes sense to pay careful attention to the amount of calcium you consume from food and if you don't get enough, make up the difference in supplements.<br /><br />-on page 68, Kris discusses the amount of protein that a person needs every day. She states that the USDA daily recommendation is 0.36 g of protein per pound of body weight, which is true. Using an example of a 130 pound woman, she calculates that she would need 47 grams of protein. Then she states that according to experts like Dr. Furhman, this recommendation is too high and that we only need 20 to 35 grams of protein. However, there is very little evidence that this is the case. All four vegan dietitians, whose names I mentioned above, suggest that vegans should not consume an amount of protein lower that what is recommended. They suggest that vegans should eat more than what is recommended. Specifically, in \\"Becoming Vegan\\" Davis and Melina say that \\"for vegans on predominantly whole foods diets [which is what Kris Carr recommends], a figure of 0.9 g protein per kg body weight is  suggested\\" 0.9 g per kg is approximately 0.45 g per pound. This will mean that a person with weight of 130 pounds will need roughly 59 grams of plant protein. It is not that hard to get a proper amount of protein on a vegan diet. However, it is important that vegans understand how much theytruly need. Dr. Furhman may be a well meaning person, however, both my husband and I experienced a protein deficiency that resulted in hair loss following my reading his book \\"Eat to Live,\\" which was one of the first books that I read after becoming vegan.<br /><br />I don't mean to discourage anyone from becoming vegan. That has been one of the best decisions that I have made in my life. I just want to make sure that readers who have been influenced by this book to change their lifestyle for the better understand how to properly balance their diet and that Kris Carr herself gives solid nutrition advice to her readers and followers.meaning person, however, both my husband and I experienced a protein deficiency that resulted in hair loss following my reading his book \\"Eat to Live,\\" which was one of the first books that I read after becoming vegan.

0061122416|5.0|_The Alchemist_ is part allegory, part heroic epic.  But it is moving, beautiful and almost saccharine.  I loved it.  The story revolves around a young Spanish goatherd who leaves all that is familiar in search of his \\"Personal Legend\\" - a legend which we all have, but all too often fail to realize by not following our hearts.  The Boy, in following his heart, is led across the Maghrib finding love, facing danger and oftentimes questioning whether his journey is worthwhile or merely a fools errand.  To tell how his journey ends would spoil the story, so I will refrain from doing so.<br /><br />The story resonated with me for a number of reasons - working with young adults, I see everyday the small decisions we make, often without much thought, that lead our lives in one direction or another, soon taking us down a path from which there is no turning back and in unexpected (and oftentimes wonderful) directions.  Such is the nature, I suspect, of one's \\"Personal Legend\\" - the Siren's Call of a course of study, a career, a move.  Sometimes we second guess these decisions or we don't follow a hunch or gut feeling; Coelho encourages us to do so.  There is something romantic in that, and above all, I am a romantic.<br /><br />In discussing this book with students and colleagues, people seem to be of two minds of the book: either they love it or they hate it.  (I have yet to find someone who is indifferent to it.)  I suspect this may have something to do with whether one is as hopeless a romantic as I am, although this may not be the case.  Following my heart, I enthusiastically recommend this book.
B000003TA4|5.0|*Note* Please refrain from displaying incorrect ignorance: if you don't agree with this review, that doesn't mean that it wasn't helpful, so vote it helpful if you vote anything. I'd appreciate it.<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind when you think of \\"Nevermind\\" is probably the overrated \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" but there have been other tracks from it that made the radio, like \\"In Bloom.\\"<br /><br />The mellow points on this album are \\"Polly\\" and \\"Something In The Way,\\" which has a proceeding dynamic-contradictory hidden track after it that makes you wait a ridiculous near 10 minutes to get to.<br /><br />I don't think the big hit is the hardest track on this album, and of course I don't think it was the best since it was too mainstream; none of the radio hits are my favorites either, although they were decent. \\"Territorial Pissings\\" is my favorite; very rough with vocals and production. Other highlights are:<br />+@\\"Breed\\"<br />+@ \\"Drain You,\\" which has the incredible line, \\"With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil, you taught me everything...\\"<br />+@\\"Lounge Act\\"<br />+@\\"Stay Way\\" with its agreed upon lyric, \\"...I'd rather be dead than cool\\"<br />+@\\"Lithium,\\" with its indignant lyric and its fluctuation of dynamics<br />+@\\"Come As You Are,\\" which has the only lyrics in the short booklet<br /><br />I'm quite a sensitive lyrical person, for those who don't know by now. The worse track on this album would be \\"On A Plain\\" because of a weird lyric about a mother dying every night.<br /><br />One thing I like about this album for sure is the drum work and the guitar utilization.<br />Great album!
B003L20IFQ|1.0|I just watched the movie 'Frozen' last night and wrote a review saying it did not deserve even the one star I was forced to give it.  Buried I'd say is worth the one star, but only because of Ryan Renolds acting, although renting it on Blu-Ray thinking it might be of better quality I have to say it isn't worth the extra cost.  The movie has no point whatever unless it was trying to convince Americans not to go to countries like Irag or Afganistan in civilian jobs to make presumably a lot of money.  In the end the company Renold's character works for sells him out so as not to have to pay the insurance when he turns up dead. Add to the lack of substance, a margin of gore to the Nth degree and you have yourself a one star movie.

Katniss has twice survived the Hunger Games, but she's still in danger. Whether she wanted to be or not, she was the catalyst that has started a war between the Capitol and its outlying Districts. She's now the symbol of freedom for the rebel fighters, but that means her family and friends are in danger as the Capitol tries to regain control. Gale is fighting with the rebels and Peeta's been captured by the Capitol and Katniss doesn't know how to keep either one safe. Even though she's no longer a pawn for the Capitol playing their Games, she's not exactly sure she isn't being used by the rebels for their own agenda.     All of the books in this series have been an emotional roller coaster ride and then at the end when you think you're finally going to see Katniss have a poignant break through and discover who she is and who she loves, we don't. Everything is quickly wrapped up and we just get a rapid summary of how the \\"war\\" and resulting fallout went.  I don't want to give away too much, but one of the guys in her love triangle basically goes off without any good bye and we get a once sentence summary told to Katniss about what happened with him. The other has to come out and ask her if she loves him, and even then doesn't get any declaration of how much he means to her, but gets a one word answer.    This is a phenomenal series and I liked this third installment just as much as the other two, until the ending. I didn't expect a happy, feel-good ending, that's not what these books were about. But I wanted some resolution, some insightfulness about all that had happened, especially between the three leading characters. I so wanted Katniss to finally come into her own, but in the end she had one redeeming moment and then went back to essentially letting others dictate her life and just going with the flow insteadof taking charge and making her own decisions.  It was such a letdown to have the rushed unfeeling ending after all of the emotion invested in these books.     Maybe that was the point of this last book. To show that Katniss had given all of herself that she had to give. After realizing that she was just a pawn for either side to get what they wanted and after seeing humanity at its worst she doesn't know how to go back to living life, so she just keeps going the best that she can. And that's just depressing.    Overall, I can't recommend this series enough. It will stay with you long past the last sentence.

0439023521|5.0|This book takes place in the future of a devastated America.  It is now called Panem and there is a thriving Capitol with 12 poverty stricken Districts that serve the Capitol. Once a year the Capitol holds the Hunger Games in which a girl and boy \\"tribute\\" from each district are placed in an arena to fight to the death. 16-year-old Katniss, from District 12, is sent to these games when she volunteers to go in place of her 12-year-old sister whose name was called. Her male counter-part from District 12 is Peeta, the son of a baker.  Katniss's main concern is surviving, and thus winning, the game, while Peeta's is to not lose his humanity while \\"playing\\" the game.     I was so blown away by this book, there's no way I can do the review justice, but I'll try to sum up some of my feelings about it. I could not put this book down and read it straight through in one night. There's a little bit of everything in this complex book; action, humor, suspense and more suspense, sentimental moments, horror and more. I had to stop and reflect throughout the book about right and wrong and the gray areas in between. It was such an emotional roller coaster ride of a read, but in an amazing way. Ms. Collins does an incredible job of showing us the softer moments and the horrifying moments through Katniss's point of view. I wasn't sure I was going to like a first point of view for this type of book, but Ms. Collins makes it work. I've been recommending this series to everyone I know.
1594202842|3.0|Being raised as an first generation Chinese American, I was interested in this book after listening an interview on NPR and reading the Wall Street Journal. Although I did not grew up in a similar environment just like the author's daughters, the book did made me remembered some of my childhood.     I understand that the author did not want to enforce a typical stereotype on Chinese parenting methods but the problem I have is the fact that she generalized Western parenting. Throughout the book, it felt like she thought that Western parenting methods was too lax and too much freedom. She also questioned this idea of the child's happiness resulting from the two parenting styles. For me, it seems like she is creating this persona that Asian parents are more focus since she generalized too much with the Western parenting style and does not try to understand it.    The biggest problem that I have with the book is the fact that I do not feel like the author learn anything from this experience. Even though she bitterly accepts her second daughter's choices in her life and supports her decision, she never really questioned why did it turned out like this. She never really explored the possibilities that she might be wrong on some level despite the fact that she is a well educated woman. I find it interesting that the hobbies that her daughters are into, she always offered her insights and suggestions despite the fact that she knows little about music or tennis. Of course, she does a little bit of research but what is the point of hiring a professional to teach her daughters if she is always butting in and enforcing her opinions onto her daughter's craft? I understand that she is trying to make sure that her kids are focused and instilling good work ethics but there is a fine line between guiding them and controlling them.     The problem with Asian parenting is the lack of change. This model might have work 20 years ago but our society and culture are changing and the methods are not keeping up with it. Remembering my childhood, I never enjoyed the threats, name calling, and the comparisons that my parents have always made. There is nothing wrong of trying to be involved with your children's life but sometimes a parent needs to step back and let your children make their own choices. You can instill good work ethics while allowing some freedom. It is time for Asian parents to realized that there are other ways of doing it but still keeping the original idea alive.    But seriously, practicing during vacation? I understand that parents worry about their children's future but what about just taking a break and spending some quality time with the family.
B0036OS3JW|5.0|I did not even know Crocs made boots till you sent me the information.

B002ZG997M|1.0|This one is a chore to sit through.    It is a pedestrian \\"Road Warrior,\\" in all senses.     Two great actors--Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman--are utterly wasted on this near-plotless and eminently pointless mess.     Recycling every stale post-apocalypse cliche, the movie adds nothing to the genre, and is DULL.     The pacing is glacial. Scene after scene is of people walking, alone, and pausing. Camera-zoom: voila, nothing happens.     The scenery is unbelievable; apparently they spent all their money on actors and had none left for special effects. The CGI is bargain-basement and looks like the painted backdrop in a high school play.     The lighting is sepia. This isn't really a color movie. This is a brown-and-white movie. Yes, I know the post-apocalypse world is supposed to be bleached and irradiated and scorched (this is why everyone has to wear sunglasses), but the brown tone just makes everything seem out of focus.     Denzel Washington underacts. He is stoical to the point of somnolent. Even when he fights (which is a lot), he seems to be just going through the motions. By the way, in the many-on-one fight scenes (which are many), each bad guy carefully waits his turn to be stabbed or gored or pierced or otherwise impaled; none of them has the brilliant idea of ganging up.     Gary Oldman overacts. This is painful to watch. He chews more scenery than Al Pacino at his worst.     But nothing helps.     A dog. A dull dog.
B002HNA95E|5.0|As many others who enjoy Madonna's music, I have pretty much grew up listening to many of Madonna's songs. One of the first songs that I can recall hearing of hers was \\"Like a Virgin\\". I admit that I was definitely under 10 years old before being exposed to her music, but I found her music good to listen to then and I still do now.  With this said, I have to agree with others who say that more of her hits could have been included in this collection. Every Madonna fan has their favorite songs that could have been included. For me, I wish that the songs \\"Fever\\"(from her Erotica album), \\"Rain\\"(from her Erotica album) and \\"I'll Remember\\"(for the film \\"With Honors\\") would have been included in the \\"Celebration\\" collection. I would respectfully say that she has had enough hits to at least have warranted a three cd set collection, rather than just two.  However, I still feel that this collection is worth owning because of the diversity of songs included in the \\"Celebration\\" collection. For instance, the music listener is treated to her daring 80's side with the catchy songs of \\"Dress You Up\\"(a song about wanting to express one's desire for who they are attracted to) and \\"Burning Up\\"(a musical track about having intense emotions for someone). There is also a diversity of good songs showcased from the 90's such as \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\". Madonna then put out some more music in the  2000's, which gave some good songs such as \\"Music\\" and \\"Beautiful Stranger\\"(song provided for the film Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me). The best way to determine if you are going to feel good from owning the \\"Celebration\\" collection is if you enjoy any of  her music from the 80's, 90's, and the 2000's (due to the fact that music from these time periods are organized throughout the two cds).
B003NX76BM|3.0|I liked the beginning and the end, but the middle had entirely too much fluff.  The most exciting part happens inthe last chapter, the whole middle was boring.  The story itself was great but just too much fluff.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina really put much emotion and creativity into her songs. Some of my favorite songs by her on this cd are \\"My Baby Loves Me,\\" \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Wild Angels\\", \\"Valentine\\", and \\"Happy Girl\\". \\"My Baby Loves Me\\" is a catchy musical number of someone being appreciated for her natural beauty (the guitar notes used in the song are notable). \\"Independence Day\\" is about a very young person who endures a challenging childhood to eventually start a new life. \\"Wild Angels\\" is a beautiful song about being watched over with the results of good luck. \\"Valentine\\" is a gorgeous song about enduring love.  My overall favorite song in this greatest hits collection definitely had to be \\"Happy Girl\\" because it serves as an upbeat reminder to find anything to be joyful about regardless of external circumstances, allow your emotions to come out in a healthful manner, and to always strive to find the essence of happiness from within yourself. One the plus side I discovered how enjoyable \\"Happy Girl\\" was when I was on one of my walks to boost my joy level(I feel lucky that walking while listening to my favorite music always help to boost my endorphin levels). There are other good country songs on this cd as well(such as the dramatic but soul stirring \\"Love's the Only House\\"). This is a great collection to get if you like upbeat and soul stirring country/pop music.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|I adore this music.  In fact, I had to stop listening to it because it reminded me constantly of my ex-boyfriend.  I don't know that I'll ever be able to listen to this album like I did last year, because it brings all of that back. That is exactly what I'm looking for in music.  It is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  It will make you cry, but in a good, cathartic way.
B004IM14RY|5.0|Wow, Ryan Reynolds shows his acting chops.  This was a really well done, What if???? kind of movie.  Really suspenseful.  I didn't know how they were going to make a whole movie from this premise, but they did a great job.
0525951652|3.0|I'm always amused when I encounter a novel whose review profile demonstrates an almost perfect \\"reverse bell curve\\".  In my experience, this occurs in one of two circumstances; first, in non-fiction political works or biographies of divisive individuals; or second, in the case of massively commercially successful works from such writers as Dan Brown, John Grisham and Stephen King.  Apparently some feel it necessary to demonstrate their literary chops by dismissing anything of commercial value.  A cursory review of Fall of Giants one star reviews indicates that a third circumstance has arisen: Dissatisfaction with Amazon's Kindle pricing policy.  Nevertheless, there are numerous one star designations ostensibly based upon the contents of this novel and that puzzles me.<br /><br />Now, far be it for me to question anyone's opinion on a purely subjective item, but I've read some perfectly awful books; awful for any number of reasons.  This book may be formulaic and it may feature numerous stereotypes.  It may lack in character development and it might skew history in some events.  Nevertheless, much as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End (which I found to be essentially the same novel), I found this book to be relatively entertaining, and even in some cases educational.<br /><br />On the subject of stereotypes, I'm reminded that in most cases, stereotypes develop for a reason.  I read a review that complained because Germans were portrayed as efficient and orderly.  Duh... ever been to Germany?  That many Russians are heavy drinkers and inclined to petty crime (you don't say!).  That the French are \\"weepy, useless fools\\" and the women are whores (I won't comment on that).  It might be politically incorrect to point out, but many nationalities and ethnic subgroups share traits that over time become identifying characteristics.  Introducing an American character who is a hard working, enterprising entrepreneur is hardly grounds for condemning a novel.<br /><br />All of that having been said, is this a literary tour de force?  Certainly not.  Is it an entertaining bit of historical fiction?  I found it so.  Not up to the standards of Michener or Edward Rutherfurd, but not a one or two star effort by any means.  Anyone that thinks so has certainly either been very fortunate in their reading selections or led a very sheltered literary life.<br /><br />My biggest criticism of this book would probably be the numerous sexual encounters vividly described therein; not because I'm a prude, or dislike erotic reading, but because they are so sophomoric and silly.  Many have no purpose other than to simply introduce sex into the storyline.  Had they been well written, believable and perhaps more integral to the story, they might have been enjoyable.  As they are, they simply cause one to roll one's eyes in amusement.<br /><br />A second irritating feature of the novel is the ridiculous coincidences that occur at several points in the story.  There are billions of people in the world, yet the same people have a remarkable way of traveling throughout the world and mysteriously running into each other, despite having no reason to do so.  As with the gratuitous sex, it doesn't destroy the novel, but detracts from it nevertheless.<br /><br />On the plus side, the historical backdrop is one not commonly found, World War I, the Russian Revolution and the years leading to those monumental events, from the British, Russian, German and American perspectives (after all, who really cares about the French?).  Despite being a big fan of historical fiction and non-fiction history, I can honestly say that this novel taught me quite a few things of which I was not aware.  That, and the fact that I found it moderately entertaining, easily overcame the minor drawbacks cited above.aid, is this a literary tour de force?  Certainly not.

B0000C3I6U|4.0|A fellow weightlifter told me I needed to see this if I was into Arnold at all.  It's a classic.  I am so I did.  It's pretty cool.  Seeing the classic TV \\"Hulk\\" actor was a bonus.  It's a brief documentary on part of the competition lead in for a few of the big names back then.  If you're into body building history and Arnold, it's worth seeing.  It's mostly about the personalities and less about practical tips, although there are some. I've watched it a few times for inspiration since buying it a couple months back. The extras are interesting on this anniversary edition, as the guys reflect on the movie with hindsight.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|There are many people that dislike the way this book ends and indeed it is not for those who prefer a Happily Ever After ending. However I think that out of the big three most popular YA series in the past few years this is the ending I prefer the most. This book is not only about rebellion but war and casualties are suffered on both sides. Collins is not afraid to kill off her character to deliver that emotional punch and I think that is what makes this series so great. It is not just background characters who suffer but those that we've come to know and love through the past two books as well.    I like the way the \\"love triangle\\" is handled as well, as there is not one moment where Katniss actually sits down and picks between Peeta and Gale. Instead the story and character naturally progress to a resolution and one that, I believe, makes sense.     Make no mistake, though, the strong Katniss we've come to know and love from the past two books is here. However there is more to being strong than just fighting and I think the greatest strength is displayed not in the moments of battle but in the moments of recovery.     One thing is for sure though, this series packs an emotional punch. I finished the book late one night and could not stop thinking about it the next day. Even now when I recall it, it's not with fond feelings. The greatest thing that Collins showed us is that in a war like this, at the end, there may be a victor but there are no winners.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I was never a big Madonna fan and for years I believed she only got by because she was over the top with her ''sexy'' image but now I see the light (lol). Best Buy was selling this double disc album for 13.99 so I decided since it was so cheap to buy it and I'm more than happy I did. The only thing I hate is that the songs are not in order and she has way too many new songs on each disc. Songs like ''Hung Up'', ''Sorry'', and ''Die Another Day'' should have been left off.<br /><br />Also It sucks that ''Power of Goodbye'' is left off as well. That is one of her best songs and I had no idea for years it was sung by her. Overall, this Greatest Hits collection is one of the best I've heard in years. I listen to her classics ''Like A Prayer'', ''Into The Groove'', ''Material Girl'', ''Dress You Up'' and ''Miles Away'' very often. I can't believe here I'am, damn near 30 and just now discovering Madonna. Crazy
B000002L68|5.0|I was a child when this album came out and I remember my older sister going crazy over this album. I remember posters being put all over the room and her and her friends fighting over who was better, MJ or Prince. Those were good days. I love Prince and this is my favorite album by him. Every song from the dance floor hit ''Lets Go Crazy'' to the bring a tear to my eye ''Purple Rain'' is beautifully written and sung. Theres nothing I can write about this album that hasn't already been written so I'm not going to try. I will write that ''Beautiful Ones'' is hands down one of the best songs ever made and everyone can relate to it.    It sucks that Prince never made an album that had the same level of success or was as good as Purple Rain but he's still one of the best artist of all times.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This movie hands down has been one of the best that I have seen in a while. 2010 was full of drab movies. From the start I was highly intrigued, maybe more so because I am a psychology nut but in essence this movie really outlines what it could be like for a person to experience a neurotic breakdown. Nina the main character is a docile introvert who tries to find a way to break out of her shell to help her obtain the main dancer role in \\"Swan Lake\\" her journey to break away drives her insane... Literally! This movie was a fun journey, that will leave you guessing what is real and what is not.<br /><br />Great Movie.

B004H8GLXQ|3.0|This intricate and mysterious story is told by the master story-teller, Vida Winter, to Margaret Lea, who is book smart and no stranger to research, as an aging Vida Winter decides it's time to tell her tale.    While this is not a quick read, the beautiful writing takes the reader to mansions in ruins, shocking truths and characters you will not soon forget. Just when it gets too dark and the ruin of a family seems imminent, the story twists with enough surprising interest to keep the reader moving and guessing.
0446310786|4.0|The central character in the novel was a black man who was accused of murder, due to prejudice and a rush to judgment.  Anyhow, this reminds me of the OJ trial.  Everyone times this book in with the \\"Catcher and Rye.\\"  I guess the two novels are connected because the main character gets in trouble with the authority and remains the protagonist.  Everyone was rooting for Boo to get free and to be exonerated.  There is a good American sentiment about the teenage rebel and the criminal that is not really bad after all.  I enjoyed reading this book because the lawyer and his children shed light on a subject that actually had more influence on American perception of crime and criminals than actual real court cases would have had.
B0045ODPKY|4.0|This movie is, unquestionably, unrealistic; from the fighting to the plot to the plot gaps, this movie is devoid of almost any realistic elements.<br /><br />However...it's still quite fun. The pace is fast, the action good, the acting fantastic (Jolie is hardly my favorite actress, but she does a smashing job in this role -- at its most unbelievable parts, you still somehow believe her). The movie doesn't slow down enough to let you think about the plot...so you don't, and it seems to make sense (until it ends). Once its over, it was so much fun to watch that the plot holes give you pause, but don't destroy your sense of enjoyment.<br /><br />I rate this 3.5 stars out of 5; fun, fast-paced action, with some holes (some of which, I hear, were explained in the extended edition; but I saw, and am rating, the theatrical version). This is the type of movie for those days when you come home from work with a brain that's thought enough already, and just wants to be entertained: Salt will not disappoint.
0393312836|4.0|This book and movie was actually a satire because it examined the reasons why criminals act.  The idea was an experiment that took a criminal and gave him a pill that prevented him from committing crime.  In real life this most likely was tried with hypnosis and brainwashing as well as sedatives that were used to suppress a pedophile's urge to rape young boys.  The results were not always the same anyhow the book did a good job shedding some light on the subject and asking some good questions.

B004E547D8|1.0|I purchased the Movie Only Edition since I was only interested in the movie and not the extras.  Really, NO HD AUDIO TRACK?      I suppose the people in Summit Entertainment's marketing department thought they were clever when they came up with the idea of a blu-ray high definition movie coupled with a compressed dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  People do not pay close enough attention to the available audio tracks when purchasing a blu-ray for it to have an influence on their decision between buying the regular or the special edition of the movie.  It is assumed that any new release will include either Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master audio.  The marketing tactic isn't causing people to spend the extra money for the special edition to get the HD audio, it is just upseting them when they discover that they have been cheated by Summit and purchased a blu-ray with compressed audio.    For the consumers that moved to blu-ray for the video and audio improvements, you'll only fool us once.  I know I'll be reading the blu-ray.com reviews closely and keeping an eye on this in the future.  I know I definitely will not be buying anything from Summit in the future
6301971272|5.0|Took me a while to locate this gem.  This is a remastering of the classic movie that got me hooked on Westerns when I was 8.  We saw this at a drive-in and all I recall from the first viewing was the scowl of \\"Blondy\\" and the gun fights, plus that musical score!    This edition is well worth buying.  The remastered film is stunning, the missing footage solves quite a few holes from the US released version.  I especially love that the film makers went back and got Eastwood and Wallach to ADR the dialogue from the restored footage.  Sure, you can tell the voices were older, but it gave it a nice feel.  It's long, and might be hard to watch in a single sitting, but it's important to try and do this to experience what it was like watching this in the theaters in 1966.      As a film maker myself, I love watching this movie to see how the western genre was redefined by a european film maker.

I don't even know why I finished reading, I suppose I hoped there might be a happy ending.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I'm not one to watch cartoon movies, but my grandson who is almost 2 yrs old just loves this movie so instead of streaming it from Net Flixs I purchased it.<br /><br />I have to say I giggle every time. I never get tired of it. It's so well done, not scary for wee ones at all. We laugh every time. Very enduring too. He can't get enough of watching it, me too!<br /><br />Great movie, so glad I bought it!
0451228731|5.0|The tagline reads \\"Michael Crichton for the information age,\\" and in virtually all aspects the book lives up to such a lofty claim.<br /><br />It's hard to really explain the book (I found myself attempting to do just that to a drunk South African, and coming up short), but as simply as I can: super-brilliant computer genius who's responsible for two of the best-selling MMORPGs of all time dies. He's left embedded in the internet a program - the titular DAEMON, or Disk And Execution MONitor - that can respond and react to news items (such as said genius' death, or the abortive raid on his house). Using the interconnectedness of the global economy, the daemon insinuates itself into daily life, capitalism comes up against the resilient community, etc, etc.<br /><br />Anyways, if it sounds pretty far-fetched...it will certainly seem so at times. The prose is nothing particularly elegant or lofty, but that's not why you read a book like this. The concepts, technologies, and overall contours of the plot are entirely engaging, and this is really a `page-turner' in the tradition of Clancy or Crichton, though with a clear contemporary bent. While the story may come across as somewhat apocalyptic, that's sort of the point - and at this point within the realm of comprehension.<br /><br />In case the technology and concepts of Daemon are a little too mindblowing for the reader, Suarez has handily thought to include a quick rundown of recommended further reading, including John Perkins' Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, P.W. Singer's Corporate Warriors, and the ubiquitous Jared Diamond's Collapse. For the more dedicated skeptic, there's even a compendium of links at the book's website directing the reader towards further information on the technologies depicted in Daemon. You can even subscribe to \\"The Daemon Technology RSS Feed,\\" which is updated infrequently but with an excellent selection of recent technology links.<br /><br />In addition to being a great read - it's always nice to take a break from the really dense stuff and read some fiction - Daemon can also help to understand a lot of the terms being thrown around in the 4GW and milblogosphere, especially in a global economic sense. System vulnerability, swarming and nodes, a global elite class, and 3D printer personal manufacturing all hold a prominent place in Daemon`s world. Its sequel, Freedom(tm), deals far more heavily with themes of resilient communities and a new system, but that review will wait for another day. In the meantime, read Daemon right now.really dense stuff and read some fiction - Daemon can also help to understand a lot of the terms being thrown around in the 4GW and milblogosphere, especially in a global economic sense.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is a great follow-up to the outstanding HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers.  The Pacific takes a completely different path than Band of Brothers, but is nonetheless just as riveting.  My father served in the PTO in the Army in New Guinea and the Philippines, so it was with rapt interest that I watched The Pacific.  As cold and forbidding Belgium was in the Band of Brothers, so too was Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester and Pavuvu hot, rainy, miserable and hellish for the Marines who served in those places. The Pacific tells in graphic detail the remorseless brutality by which the Japanese soldier fought.  The Pacific tells a story of the Marine's bravery and valor that we as Americans must be aware.  The men and women who fought World War 2 truly were the \\"greatest generation.\\"
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I am a great fan of the movie A Christmas Carol and this was a particularly great version.  I absolutely loved it and will be watching it every CHristmas!!!
B000OPPSX0|5.0|Elegant, supremely musical performances; Beethoven himself would have been impressed. Tempi are well-chosen, without the usual pell-mell rush to the end, the performers use their superb techniques to serve the music, and it all succeeds extremely well.
B001BJ6918|5.0|The picture and audio were amazing.  If you are looking for a bluray to show off your hd tv, this is it.  And for a bonus: THE MOVIE IS GREAT!!!
B002N8A14M|5.0|While it is \\"last generation\\", I had opted for a 5th gen IPod when they hit sale prices. The size and shape make it perfect for the gym, but with the rigors of cardio and weights, and the constant shift between gym shorts w and w/o pockets, it necessitated the right case. After searching thoroughly, and buying disappointingly in other cases, I've found that Griffin nailed it. The arm fit is right; the clip is ideal (although I wouldn't stress the plastic for the \\"stand\\" concept); access to the dial, jack and port is simple; and the protection is excellent. If you have the 5th gen or simply trapped in state of the past technology like me because I don't need every new bell and whistle, this is the case for you.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|This film is a futuristic dystopian sci-fi action film.  The basic scoop is that a prosthetics company developed the technology for parapalegics and quadrapalegics to connect with a synthetic body (a robot = surrogate) with which they can navigate the world, and interact with other people without the hiderance of their disabilities.  But, as expected, the technology catches on and it's not long before mass production of the units drops their price sufficiently so that just about everyone an afford them, and uses them, and they don't even leave their homes any more.  Then, of course, there is backlash against \\"the machine.\\"  The up side is that crime drops to nearly nil.  The down side, people are losing touch with reality.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays an FBI agent, and he and his wife are struggling wtih the stresses of losing a child in an accident.<br /><br />When crimes start to happen Willis and his partner are soon hot on the trail of individuals whose goal is unclear, but, well, that's what the story is about.<br /><br />Be advised that while there is actually minimal foul language and sexual content, but there is a LOT of violence.  The violence involves largely the surrogates, and all kinds of damage to them.  Even so, it can get pretty gritty.  So if that troubles you, I advise that you steer clear.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the film, thuogh it is not likely to become any kind of classic.<br /><br />4 stars for an interesting plot and various twists that would be tough to predict.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|First: My usual grip at Amazon for mixing all reviews of the movie and not the product. This review is solely for [[ASIN:B0019NB9A2 Forbidden Planet [Blu-ray]]] and not the earlier DVD release or the two disc anniversary edition. I have no idea why Amazon cannot fix this as they say it is product review.     Anyway the Blu Ray edition is great! The transfer is spectacular, it's almost like seeing for the first time. The special features are very good, even though a cherished 'myth' is shattered (I won't give it away.      This movie was highly influential in many ways; it was the first SciFi movie put out by a major studio as an A feature. The special effects for the era were a very big deal. The sound track was entirely electronic (so much so that the Musicians Union made MGM list them as 'acoustic tonalities' so that they could not be nominated for 'music' awards).     The film was a major influence on Gene Roddenberry for Star Trek and you can see the influence on later film makers in many ways.    All in all I highly recommend the Blu Ray editon.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I don't know about anyone else, but what really got me through this book was picturing Sean Bean as Barrons.  If they make a movie Sean would make a perfect Barrons.
B004HO6HWK|3.0|I was expecting just another Transporter type of Jason Statham movie, but there is a bit more depth here to go along with the typical action storyline. It's all about a hitman getting wronged by his employer and seeking revenge. Wow, so original right? Okay, I just now found out that The Mechanic is a remake of a 1972 film starring Charles Bronson, so don't expect me to compare the two here.<br /><br />Jason Statham is probably the biggest active action movie star right now. I'm not really a fan of his, mainly due to the fact that he always looks, acts and sounds the same in pretty much everything he does. The man does know how to sell toughness, especially during the fight scenes. Also, the \\"I'm going to kill you look\\" that he likes to shoot at the bad guys is quite effective. Ben Foster has more acting range and is quite good here, even though the character as written on paper is nothing special. After his father is killed he gets trained by and then teams up with Statham.<br /><br />What really surprised me were the action scenes. There were a few good hand to hand fights and shootouts, but this character is all about making deaths look like accidents. So instead, we get a lot of fast kills rather than ones that are drawn out like in the Transporter films.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this as a future rental. It's not outstanding, but I would say it is one of the better action flicks I've seen recently. In fact, I would watch this over The Expendables any day.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B002JVWQSW|5.0|We got rid of our cable when we bought our new home, and haven't regretted that as we have had so much to do with the new home - as well as getting chickens! We saw a few episodes of this on the absolutely worthless Hulu Plus, and decided we needed more.  We can't wait to watch them all! Great characters and very funny show!
B0041KKYDS|5.0|It's about time 127 Hours got the wide release (thanks to 6 Oscar nominations) it deserves, so today was the day I got to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I think everyone going to see the film knows the basic facts of this true story. Aron Ralston goes hiking, falls, has a giant boulder land on his arm, and in the end he has to resort to removing his arm with a dull pocket knife to allow for his escape.<br /><br />Even more so than Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco is the movie. There is a brief scene before the fall when he meets two girls and there are a number of quick flashback and fantasy type sequences with other characters, but for the most part Franco is the only person on screen. I remember the days when almost everyone (including me) said this guy couldn't act. I'm talking about his role in the Spider-Man movies. The first time I noticed real acting talent was when he played the stoner in Pineapple Express. I'm here to tell you that this is the best performance by an actor I've seen in any movie released in 2010. I haven't seen The King's Speech yet, but Colin Firth will have his work cut out for him in my eyes. Into the Wild shows another character based on a real person and similar to the one Franco plays here, but rather than a kid who thinks he knows everything about survival and the wilderness, we sympathize and want this character to prevail, mostly thanks to James Franco's likeability in the role. He shows just about every range of emotion and I never for once thought I was watching anything other than the real person fighting for his life.<br /><br />There are two things I didn't really care for. Danny Boyle's style of quick editing felt out of place at times and I could have done without some of the music choices.<br /><br />Other than those minor negatives, 127 Hours is well paced, suspenseful, expertly acted, memorable and easily one of top 5 films of 2010.<br /><br />If you like this movie or if it sounds like you would, check out the one man show that is Ryan Reynolds in Buried for nearly the same claustrophobic intensity. For the man surviving in nature aspect, check out Sean Penn's Into the Wild. They are not at the same level as this film, but both are still worthy of a rental for those with more than an ounce of patience.s in Buried for nearly the same claustrophobic intensity.

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|The last two books of Larsons triology should have been combined as only one book. As in most triologies, the first book was clearly the better of the three. A lot of \\"fill-in\\" and \\"fluff\\" go into making up the \\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest\\". It was worth reading but only barely.
030726999X|3.0|I was dissapointed by this book and find it the weakest part of the trilogy. I think \\"Dragon Tatoo\\" is one of the best books I read in recent years. It was highly original, mesmerising and intelligent thriller. \\"Fire\\" was less tight and had several dragging parts, but the powerful action parts, great plot twists, and shocking ending, still made it an excellent sequel. \\"Hornets Nest\\", unfortunately, is a different matter. The mystery, thriller and action are minimal here and are replaced by much more overt - often simplistic - political text. In many parts of the plot the characters are not talking - they are simply preaching to each other. and in worse parts it is the author who is preaching to us. The charachter buildup - major strength in the first books - is here much more dull and two-dimentional. Good guys are noble, smart and resourceful; bad guys are bigots, heartless and - well - not too bright to be considered true villains. In my view this is the biggest hole in the plot (SPOLIER WARNING): we are expected to believe that the most \\"secret of secret\\" security body in Sweden is running a conspiracy that is amazingly simplistic and amateurish, and that despite their unlimited power and resources they are extremely short sighted and are easily blindsided by a bunch of journalists, street policemen and private security guys. What starts early in the book as a very promising game of strategy between the good guys and the bad guys, very quickly turns into a cat-and-mouse game where the good guys hold most of the cards and the bad guys are stumbling in the dark. I found this very dissapointing and it took a lot from my enjoyment reading the book.<br />Having said all that, this is still a Larson book and as such very readable and in several parts very enjoyiable. If you read the first two books, for sure you want to read this one as well, if only to get a proper closure to the series. But overall it doesn't match the quality and does not provide the unique reading experience of the first installments.rience of the first installments.

0525423842|5.0|My 10 year old really enjoyed this book.  Seems like most of her friends are very into fantasy and Harry Potteresque books- it's never been her thing.  Once she read all of the Beverly Cleary, Ann M. Martin, and the whole Nancy Drew series- she's been hard pressed to find books that she enjoys.  It doesn't seem that is what YA authors are putting out (quality) these days.  This John Grisham book fits the bill.  Wish there were more like it.
B003Q6D27S|4.0|The original Saw with its \\"didn't see that coming\\" twist ending for me was the best of the series.  Now we have Saw 7 with its \\"I really didn't see that coming\\" twist ending. However I had to smile-my leg had been pulled and I enjoyed every tug.    The new entry revolves around Bobby who has made a fortune claiming to be a survivor of Jigsaw. He's a liar and must be punished involving rescuing the syncophants who have helped him in his deception. Too bad he isn't good at saving lives as he is lying. But hey this is Saw--there's no fun if the victim is saved.      But the main attraction of the Saw movies are the ingenious and gruesome deathtraps, and this movie ups the ante in this department with all the blood and gore splatter, sometimes even a bit on the gross side.    The movie does tie up a lot of loose ends from the previous 6 films and be prepared for a doozy of the ultimate twist.
B002VPE1PW|4.0|I bought this sleeve for my Wacom Bamboo Pen Tablet, and it was a good fit. Since the tablet is too slim, it's a little loose, but the straps inside the sleeve are a great solution for that issue.  I'm using it mainly for keeping my tablet protected at home, and to avoid the dust, however, since it's not that cushiony, I wouldn't trust it at all for traveling.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The amount of action and thrill carries the movie alone.  The mix in of cute/funny romance, John Malkovich's character and create lines make this movie one of my favorite all-time action films that will be watch time and time again.
B00433TO52|1.0|Poorly formatted with sentences broken in half and continued 2 lines down. Each dialogue is separated by an empty line - a huge waste of space for Kindle owners. Look elsewhere.
B0006L0LNY|5.0|This movie was a real like story, with very good acting. Very entertaining. Where is a sequel with Halle Berry?
B004DK5CW4|3.0|Why did Disney make the decision to snub those of us who can't afford a Blu-ray player?  I am reading about all the great extras that were not included in my \\"basic\\" DVD.  I would have gladly paid extra for those bonus features, because I loved this amazing horse, and was thrilled to see his story come to the big screen.  I saw this film as my 60th birthday treat with a friend who knows nothing about horse racing.  She loved it.  That tells me this is a great general audience film.  Yes, horse racing fans will spot errors and dramatic license in the narrative.  Keeneland in Kentucky stands in for Belmont on Long Island.  The birth of Secretariat is totally fabricated, including using a bay foal to stand in for the shining chestnut we know as Big Red.  Where is the great Riva Ridge, who was the real savior of Penny's farm?  And I absolutely loathe the creative choice to play gospel music during the stretch run of the most incredible Belmont ever.  I've seen it a hundred times and it still sends chills up my spine and brings tears to my eyes.  Worshipful silence is all you need.  Even so, buy this DVD, and lucky for you if you have Blu-Ray.  I spit on Disney.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|Short and to the point, you HAVE to be a fan of film noir in order to like this movie. (Noir is French for black) It is SLOW, has impeccable acting and cinematography and will keep you very straight faced the entire time because there is not ONE moment of levity in it. If you want to feel good after watching a movie watch something else.
B000UX6THK|5.0|How happy am I to finally own this!?    This remains the ultimate compilation for TP fans.  The special features are fun, but I bought this for the pilot as well as the ability to finally own the whole series (and not on my taped-from-TV VHS collection).
B003QCCS36|2.0|While I appreciate the attempt to create a Music from Big Pink-like homemade vibe, the songs here are wan and dreary, lifelessly played and the production is drab. LaMontagne's voice and the title track have some appeal, but otherwise nothing much here.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I enjoyed the snapshot aspect of this storyline. Instead of being led through each event, you as the reader have the opportunity to integrate your own ideas of what happens. Overall well-written and compelling.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|A magnificent collection of songs echoing R.E.M., the Pogues, Springsteen's \\"Promised Land,\\" the Stones' \\"Country Honk,\\" Gram Parsons, built around a vague changing seasons - themed song cycle. Oh, and Colin Meloy's great antique dictionary of lyrics have never sounded as organic and moving. Beautifully played and produced.
B000002H2Z|5.0|I was first introduced to the Cure several years ago with the stellar, slightly disturbing in it's subject matter, dance pop single \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\" off of 1987's eclectic \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me.\\"  After exploring their sound, as well as the darker, earlier albums, I quickly came to appreciate Robert Smith's quirky pop sensibilities, always laden with that tinge of melancholy and darkness.  For some reason, I never got around to hearing this album in it's entirety for a long time, even though I knew and loved a few of its well known singles, such as \\"In Between Days\\", and \\"Close to Me.\\"  If there is one Cure album to surpass them all, this is the one.  It finds just the right balance of the band's different styles and nearly all of its songs are excellent.    While the album's style is varied, much like its followup, \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\", it is much more concise and has better written songs.  While the aforementioned album was excellent, it contained several filler tracks and songs like \\"Torture\\", which had a terrific melody but too much wailing by Mr. Smith.  In contrast, Robert sounds excellent here, particularly on the haunting \\"Kyoto Song\\" and the closer, \\"Sinking\\", which follow the vein of the earlier dark albums like \\"Faith\\" and \\"Seventeen Seconds\\" but sound much more polished and mature.  Most people who have ever heard of the Cure know of the well known single and opening track, \\"In Between Days\\", which is a short, perfect little slice of dark tinged pop rock.  Other excellent cuts include \\"A Night Like This\\", a grooving rock number which contains a saxophone solo here which has been replaced lately in live performances with a guitar solo, and the \\"Baby Screams\\", a harder rock song with excellent hooks and guitar riffs, which comes off as a much better \\"Shiver and Shake.\\"  \\"Push\\" seems to be a concert staple, and for a good reason.  With the exception of \\"Just Like Heaven\\", this is Robert's best straight up pop song, with an excellent build up section before the catchy lyics come in.  The album's strongest track is the latin tinged \\"The Blood\\".  Not only is the music rollicking and catchy, containing Spanish guitar and pounding bass lines, but it has excellent, quirky lyrics that come off as a poignant criticism of organized religion.  Even the album's weakest cut, \\"Screw\\", it a fun experimental pop ditty not unlike what was found on 1984's underrated \\"The Top\\".    This album had it all.  It seems to be overshadowed by their \\"supposed\\" masterpiece \\"Disintegration\\", which is odd.  If I had to introduce someone to the Cure, this is a much better album to do that with.  This is the real Cure, stripped down without the overbearing weight of that opera styled album.  Don't get me wrong, \\"Disintegration\\" has its spectacular moments for sure, but it simply doesn't outclass these 10 tracks.    Buy it and don't regret it.
0634022296|4.0|This book is a great reference. The only flaw is that the numbering of the finger placement is not present. Other than that it is a fantastic book.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|In the case of the updated original trilogy: who cares? In all honesty, the changes don't take away or augment the story in any way, shape or form. I think of it in the same case as the LOTR extended editions, as they only improved on the story, in my opinion. Does it really alter the storyline if Boba Fett now has Jango Fett's voice, or if Jaba is in episode IV, or if the Emperor in I, II, III, and VI is now the same Emperor in V, or if a few new creatures popped up to give it more scenery, or if the guy who's supposed to be a hero shoots to defend himself only after he's been fired at, or if the RTOJ picnic song was replaced by a BETTER song, or if Hayden Christiansen is now looking at Luke at the end? Not in the least bit. The story, the philosophies, and the themes are still the same.     In the case of the prequel trilogy: OK, I can understand some parts. The dialogue, Jar Jar, and Jake Loyd, sure. I'll give you those. However, the changes in style, such as the use of polished scenery as opposed to the original trilogy, make sense in all honesty. They serve to show how the Empire's presence really deteriorated the galaxy as shown in the original trilogy. And the story, such as the teen angst within Anakin, and how he ultimately turned to the dark side, are more than called for.     The fact is, uptight fanboys just need to lighten up, because the changes are ultimately for the best. Most of what changed the way films are made still remain in tact.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I have been playing the CoD series on the PS3 for a while but never owned a headset.  I *really* wanted to go with the Tritton AX Pro (True 5.1 sound; 4 speakers in each ear cup!) but I could not justify the sticker price (~$150).  So when I started looking at the rest of the options, the PX21 stood out.  Yes, they are 'only stereo', not digital, but they really do a great job.  Game sounds were great in Black Ops and the ability to hear footsteps from a particular direction is priceless.  I also really like the controls.  Chat boost is a great feature and the bass boost gives you plenty of rumble.    If you currently have no headset this is a quality headset for a great price. Consider that Sony wants you to shell out $50 for a bluetooth mic that doesn't mix in game sound and the game sound from your TV constantly feeds back into your mic making your teammates complain.  For less than $20 more, you can get a complete headset that sounds great.  I know there are better headsets out there, but I don't think you can beat the price/performance of the PX21s...
B000UZPIAW|5.0|i absolutely am fascinated with this book, i never knew who nikki sixx was until i started reading a sample of the book i must say i am certainly intrigued. i recommend everyone should read this book and get a taste of reality. and if u have a sick loved one just know they really wanna stop but someone needs to show they care!!!
1433207044|5.0|First of all, I do not understand the animosity of most of the reviews.  The objectivist (artist, own man) character is usually the hero in most books and movies.  This has been true since Greek times.  I think a lot of people are putting in their views of Rand and are not really reviewing the book.  No, she did not invent the wheel.  Yes, it is true she is not the only person that wrote a book with an objectivist type hero and in fact most books and movies have one.  Most cartoons have one.  In fact, they are a little more blatant as far as the message goes.  I am sorry if that upset her in any way to realize this.  And I am sorry to say that to most Ayn Rand fans.  She really did not invent the wheel as far as ideology goes, but she wrote one great book.  What makes this book great is that our hero, Howard Roarke is flawed.  In all the other stories, movies, and books I have read the objectivist type hero is always perfect.  Roarke is far from perfect.  Ayn Rand does not try to make him appear any better than he is, and in fact, she sacrifices his image to prove a point about how society views women.  I would even say she outright smears him.  No writer other than Shakespeare has ever done that to the hero.  That's what makes the book great.  It has a lot of the same themes as Titanic, except the characters are three dimensional and they all have flaws.  Even the Jack/Roarke character.  You even feel kind of sorry for the Peter Keening character (who is like Cal).  He is human, he he does not come off as a bad guy.  In fact, his life revolves around being nice to everyone.  He really admires Howard Roarke, who keeps snubbing him.  He's kind of nice guy that gets in the middle of a game that he never asked for.  Roarke and Keening also kind of start off the same, they go to the same college.  But Roarke gets expelled.  In fact, I think this gives Roarke more respect but it is harder to feel sorry for him because he causes his own demise.  In the end though, he prevails and he doesn't die.  He never dies.  That's great, and it is so original.  In other story lines, like in Titanic, Jack is in the position he is in due to no fault of his own, and he dies.  It is easier to feel for the objectivist type artist when they are downtrodden due to no fault of their own.  It is harder to feel sorry for someone when you give this character respect and allow them live, and Ayn does.  It is just so brave, and unlike anything I have ever read.  I fully recommend it.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book! I read it a few years ago, so i can't give a detailed review. But I do remember that it was a very fun and entertaining book to read! It is a book that takes you on a a fantastical, colorful journey!
B00009AOBI|5.0|One would have thought that after her performance in \\"Silkwood\\" Cher would have received her props in Hollywood. The Academy would later make up for overlooking her in this film by presenting her the Best Actress Oscar for \\"Moonstruck.\\" But it is in \\"Mask,\\"   where Cher proves her acting mettle.    Cher acts and even looks the part of Rusty, the mother of a severely disfigure child; but that is almost a side note. What gives the film its ability to relate to its audience is the tension between this beleaguered woman and her on-again/off- again boyfriend Gar (Sam Elliot, delivering a subtly cool performance); and Rusty and her staunchly old-fashioned parents. Cher takes advantage of the opportunities to flaunt her acting chops without being over the top. It is here where she proves that she can more than hold her own against any of Hollywood's so-called A-list actresses.    Eric Stolz plays Rocky Dennis (upon whom the story was based), and the chemistry between he and his older co-star is unmistakable. Their relationship comes off as real, without any of the parents vs. teenager cliches. Both Rocky and Rusty feel things deeply and it is that trait that binds them. Rusty is a single mother struggling with drug addiction, but never lets it get in the way of loving her child.    Interesting contrast between Rocky's world and the world of the \\"typical teen,\\" so much so that you don't put Rocky nor feel a need to root for him, but you enjoy him. You know that his puppy love will not end happily, but you know that Rocky will weather the storm.    Moreover, her biker friends serve as an extended family to Rocky, who is played by Stolz as a kid who is all heart, and who sees himself not as one desperate to fit in, but who waits for the rest of the world to catch up to him.    Wonderful performances by the actors who make up the biker gang of which Gar is a part of.  They are men of depth and compassion as they embrace Rocky as one of their own.     The climax delivers one ofthe more emotionally charged scenes you'll ever see--comparable to \\"Beaches\\" and \\"Imitation Of Life.\\" It is heart-wrenching without being sappy, showing the depth of a mother;'s love for her offspring.    This is definitely one of my all-time favorite films and a must-see for those who love films that have the power to pluck an emotional chord. Good date flick because it has what it takes to touch men and women equally deeply without beating you over the head with sentimentalism. Cher and Stolz keep it real.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|This product works great, the signal has no loss of quality and does exactly what I needed (positions the HDMI cable to an angle, rather than straight).<br />The packaging, which is an AMAZON issue, needs to be better monitored.  The item is only a couple inches in length, and securely packaged, then the package is re-packed into a rather LARGE box that could have been used to ship a table lamp in...come on AMAZON...think, you are waiting material and money over packaging your products...not to mention, the additional cost of shipping (your customers pay for).  Secure is one thing...but most of the time you folks go overboard and it is wistfulness.

B0045ZAQSM|4.0|If you're expecting Fatih Akin as the serious master \\"The Edge of Heaven\\" and \\"Head-on\\", you won't find him here. \\"Soul Kitchen\\" is a nifty little comedy, set in a seedy restaurant in the seedy bohemian Wilhemsburg district of Hamburg.  Owner Zinos, a young Greek German whose back is out for most of the story and whose girlfriend is off in China, makes junk food that his puffy longtime customers down with beer.  Everything changes, though, in the throes of neighborhood gentrification.  Everything.  Running a restaurant is a thinly-veiled allegory for filmmaking--whether you give people the junk they want, or make fabulous food and find/cultivate an audience to love it.  There's a great love of humanity here.
1400064287|5.0|The book of the week was Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath. I love this book. I am a big fan of how the mind works and this book has so many answers. The main idea of the book is explaining why ideas stick... aka why they are passed around for years and years and why everyone that tells them remembers all the juicy details. For example urban myths... stories about people having their kidneys stolen, the \\"fact\\" that humans only use 10% of their brains, or stories of people poisoning Halloween candy. All of these are myths- there is not a band of organ harvesters that steals kidneys, humans actually use 100% of their brains in a given day, and there have only been 2 true cases of poisoned Halloween candy and both cases were done by the children's own family. The questions this book answers is what do these stories have that we can harness and make our own words 'sticky.'<br /><br />The answer: sticky stories need to have 6 attributes. They need to be Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, and they have to be Stories.<br /><br />Simple: You have to find the core of the message you are trying to send. This will be your one sentence phrase to get the message across. If your reader only reads one sentence, they should still take away the message you are trying to get across.<br /><br />Unexpected: Surprise the reader! Your intention should be to hold their attention and the best way to do that is to tell them something unexpected. One of the best ways to do this is to highlight a 'knowledge gap.' You give the reader enough information to know what is happening. The human mind then has an innate desire to close the gap with more knowledge.  News casters do this with their 10 second commercials telling you what the news stories will be at the \\"9 o'clock news\\"- they will say something like \\"A gorilla escaped from the zoo and ended up at a children's birthday party, find out more at 9.\\" That is a unexpected tag line that fills your head with enough of the story that you crave the rest. That's what we need to do with our message.... have them hungry for more.<br /><br />Concrete: Help people understand and remember. Help the reader paint a picture in their mind. Use words that help them see exactly what you are talking about. You can even make them live it, so they remember better. For example: if you are teaching how to add and subtract. Use props, so the students can see what it is to be subtracted and added. If you just write 40 +20... it's too abstract. However, if you have 40 bricks and you add another 20 bricks... it's concrete. The mind has a picture painted and it will retain that information much easier.<br /><br />Credible: Make them believe. You need some credible details in your story for it to be believable. My favorite way of doing this used in the book is the Sinatra test. \\"If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere\\"- if you are starting a catering business and only have one previous client, but that client was catering a White House event.. anyone will hire you. Use your credentials to your advantage.<br /><br />Emotional: Make people care. My favorite way of presenting this was the Mother Teresa principle: If I look at the one, I will act. Here are two scenarios: 1. (a video of the country of Africa) You could help many people in Africa with your donation.. it would go toward food, shelter, and helping education. 2. (A video of a young girl sitting in the dirt) With your donation you could help Cindy... your donation would help feed Cindy, put a roof over Cindy's head, and help send Cindy to school. Between these two scenarios, nearly everyone would choose helping Cindy over having the money spread over the whole country of Africa.  You have an emotional connection to Cindy after seeing that video, but you aren't as emotionally invested in the whole country of Africa. Make your message specific and tug on their heart strings to draw in your target.<br /><br />Stories: Get people to act. Subway has the Jared story. This is a story that gets people to act. They see a before an after picture of this college student that lost a couple hundred pounds by eating Subway. Well, if I was a 425 lb person I would be encouraged to go to Subway after hearing that story. \\"If Jared can do it, you can do it\\"  is the ultimate message and it works. It's difficult to find these stories, but when you find them you have a gold mine.<br /><br />This book is tremendous. It is probably the best book I have read in several months. The Heath Brothers did their research and did terrific work. There are so many great stories and insights within the pages. I have learned so much this week and I urge you to pick up this book. I guarantee you will have some massive take-aways. As always, if you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.They see a before an after picture of this college student that lost a couple hundred pounds by eating Subway.

B0042816YK|1.0|I will start off by saying that I hated the book.  Hated it!  So, why did I watch the movie?  Good question.  I had hoped it would be better than the book.  Still selfish.  Still boring.      You will love this book if:  you are in an unfulfilling marriage and hate your partner; feel like you should be doing something \\"better\\" with your life; just are not a happy person...    If you love your husband and life, you cannot relate to this selfish person.  Even Julia Roberts could not make her likeable.
031236198X|4.0|The book of the week was Our Iceberg is Melting by John Kotter. Interesting book written about organizations going through change. I'm not sure why I was attracted to this book, but it may have something to do with the fact I was in Missouri for the last week and a half with temperatures over 100 degrees everyday... and this book had icebergs on the cover. In any case, the book was very good. It is a lot like the book Who Moved My Cheese by Spencer Johnson in the way it gives a fable to illustrate how to change an organization.<br /><br />Change is a very important concept. Understanding it and knowing when to do it are very important as well. It is human nature to resist change. It's in our nature to want to keep the status quo and continue on with what your doing. However, as we all know, especially in recent years, we cannot plan on everything staying the same forever. If you turn a blind eye to what is happening around you you'll eventually have to pay the consequence... your iceberg will sink.<br /><br />This book was focused around a colony of penguins and one particular penguin recognized the signs of the iceberg starting to melt. The rest of the book was about him getting everyone on board with what he recognized and making the change needed so all the penguins didn't go under with the iceberg. After much prodding, the majority of the colony was on board with accepting the change needed. There were some penguins that were always negative and we have all experienced other people that are like that. They just worked around these penguins and made changes anyway. Eventually the penguins moved to a different iceberg and than another until they found the perfect one. The first change was a challenge but moving to another iceberg after that was much easier.<br /><br />The focus of the book was on The Eight Step Process of Successful Change...<br /><br />Set the Stage<br /><br />1. Create a Sense of Urgency- Help others see the need for change and the importance of acting immediately.<br /><br />2. Pull Together the Guiding Team- Have a powerful group guiding the change- leadership, credibility, communication, authority, analytical- these are all important qualities to get into the team.<br /><br />Deciding What to Do<br /><br />3. Develop the Change Vision and Strategy- Clarify how the future will be different from the past and how you can make the future a reality.<br /><br />Making it Happen<br /><br />4. Communicate for Understanding and Buy In- Make sure as many others as possible understand and accept the vision and strategy.<br /><br />5. Empower Others to Act- Remove as many barriers as possible so that those who want to make the vision a reality can do so.<br /><br />6. Produce Short-term Wins- Create some visible, unambiguous successes as soon as possible.<br /><br />7. Don't Let Up- Press harder and faster after the first successes. Be relentless with initiating change after change until the vision is a reality.<br /><br />Make it Stick<br /><br />8. Create a New Culture- Hold on to the new ways of behaving, and make sure they succeed, until they have become strong enough to replace old traditions.<br /><br />These 8 steps are great! Study them and use them to create change... The book was short and covered the material in a very effective way.

0316017922|5.0|The book of the week is Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. I think Gladwell is a genius. I reviewed The Tipping Point about this time last year and loved it. There is an incredible amount of great content to his books. The last one I need to read is Blink.. and I have no doubt that I will add it to the bookshelf before long.<br /><br />As much as I loved his book, I cannot give you a lot of information from it. Each chapter has a number of pages and there is very very little repetition of information. What I can tell you is this:<br /><br />Gladwell contends that Outliers, especially when making reference to success are not really outliers at all. But these people are a product of their culture and other chance encounters that made them who they are. He explains the successes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Bill Joy, All-Star Hockey Players, Mozart, Joe Flomm, and Christopher Langan. These people are remarkable, no doubt, but a large reason they are who they are now is because of the time they were born, or the jobs their parents/grandparents had, or the freak chance they received to be able to write thousands of hours of programing code at the age of 13, while some college professors did not even get that opportunity.<br /><br />Let me give you a very cliff-notes taste of what I am referring...For instance: 40% of All-Star Canadian Hockey Players are born between January and March. The researcher that discovered this phenomenon found that it was because of the cut-off for junior league teams. The kids that were born in January had more physical development than any kids born in that year (meaning they were just bigger kids). And the larger the kid the better in hockey. So what happened was the larger kids were the ones chosen for better teams which means that they got extra practice and extra attention. The more hours you spend practicing something the better you become... it has been concluded that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice to become a master at something. If you were a kid born in December, you were already at a disadvantage. That being said, it's not a surprise to see that a majority of the All-Star Canadian Hockey Team had early birthdays. The information in this book is interesting and eye-opening.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this book and this author! I recommend this book for everyone, no matter who you are, because it helps you see where some extraordinary success stems from... As always, if you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.ecember, you were already at a disadvantage.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|The first time I became aware of Nicki Minaj was when Kanye stated that the best rappers out there are currently Eminem and Nicki. As much as I like Kanye and agreed with the Eminem part of his statement, I wasnt about to go out and buy Nicki's CD just on his say so. This weekend, I used up the last of my Christmas vouchers and bought Pink Friday. It is a revelation of an album. She has her own MCing style and her rhymes are certainly more than just vulgarity being spewed out. Her peculiarity is refreshing and she can almost certainly only get better in the future.
B002ZG997M|4.0|The movie was good because Denzel Washington was in it. I am a Denzel Washington fan. The movie was okay, but is not the same without Denzel. Good plot what would happen to the world if everything comes to an end. The ending is good. They talk about a book that the bad guy really wants because with this book the bad guy could have control over the earth; really interesting. I'm pretty sure you already know what book we are talking about, which have the most influence on humans. Well, that's it pretty much; Denzel's mission is to take that book to the west to rebuild the world. Overall good movie thanks to Denzel. He should try to do roles as he did on Man on Fire; what a great movie!
B002ZG994U|4.0|THE A TEAM    When this film was first announced I was really excited for it because one of my favorite Mixed Martial artists Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson would star in it. Of course you know I had tog o see it and own it when it was released on DVD and Blu Ray. So here we are and I am finally going to review it, something I should have done a while back. Still better late than never I always say, or is that some one else's saying, anyway.    This not you're A-Team you may remember from the TV show, no not at all, could be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Me personally I loved this new version and found it to be nothing more than just pure fun. It also didn't hurt that one of my favorite MMA fighters Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson is in this movie as BA. Any way regardless of all that this is a very fun flick that is meant just to be that, fun. So turn the brain off and enjoy what is on the screen.    The story follows a group of men that come together in one hilarious moment after the next and form a new group in the US military. They tackle the missions that no one else can and do it in the most outrageous yet ingenious ways ever. You know, they take on the jobs no one else can or wants to, I love it. Any way they are sent out onto another one of these missions and are successful of course, but there triumphant return is spoiled by the murder of their commanding officer. With no record of him sending them on this mission and the military thinking they killed him they are sent to live out the rest of their days in prison. So after they escape prison, with a little help from a not so trustworthy guy they plan on clearing their names.    The film is just straight up fun, nothing more nothing less, if you try to turn on the brain you may disappointed. Everything in this movie goes bang and everything is pure dumb fun. I knew this going in luckily so I had a great time watching it. Not to mention that mixed martial artist Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson plays BA,love it. He is a very funny guy in real life and it shows here, you can tell had fun doing this. Liam Neeson is brilliant in this and plays his character up, as does Bradley Cooper who is just his plain old self, which is a good thing here. Sharlto Copley is a show stealer as Murdock, way to funny, brilliant job. Patrick Wilson, and Brian Bloom are equally as good here as two of the villains in this film, great jobs on both parts.    It is obvious that I enjoyed this film but I must say that you have to go in knowing what you are getting. If you do I think you will have a good time as well, writer/director Joe Carnahan along with fellow writers Skip Woods and even Brian Bloom himself did a great job making this just pointless fun. I do recommend this film if you are looking for a good, dumb, fun flick for a weekend afternoon or something.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|I have to say it; WHAT A GOOD MOVIE. Yes, it is. First of all, I won't say too much because this is the kind of movie I can't describe; you must go to the nearest theater NOW! I'm not a fan of Natalie Portman. I have to be honest with you I did not know her name until now; I mean I have seen her in other movies but did not know her name. Ladies and gentlemen this girl deserves the OSCAR. I don't know why you still reading this; you should leave your home right now and watch this movie.    This movie is good and very weird but the acting is really good. The ending.. Well.. You have to see it because is one of the best endings I have ever seen for this kind of movie. Watch it; it may have some weird stuff that maybe were not necessary for the movie but still what a great movie.
B004AHNIGM|1.0|Once again the unimaginative and dogmatic - but fashionable - producer T-Bone Burnett has gotten his hands on another icon in American music and imposed his one size fits all \\"sound\\" on him.  This time it is Gregg Allman.   What a huge disappointment after waiting all these years!  T-Bone has applied his usual muffled, muddied retro sound on iconic bluesman Gregg Allman - a square peg in a round hole if ever there was one.  First, it sounds as if the band is playing underwater (i.e., the typical T-Bone Burnett sound).   Second, stylistically the rockabilly sensibilities of Burnett simply don't mesh with the blues sensibilities of Allman.    A great producer should have the ability and creativity to enhance the natural attributes of a recording artist.  T-Bone is utterly lacking in this ability and repeatedly from artist to artist simply imposes his same tired, formulaic approach.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  This time it doesn't.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|it's a great show for any fan of zombies. Is not just about killing these flesh eaters, it also have some drama between the characters. For any zombie fan I highly recommend this show. Is not like any movie; is much more. The series start with a really good plot. They guy does not know where he is, or what just happen. He just starts walking around and tries to put the pieces together; the same way how 28 days later started. The series ending was great; you know there is going to be more. Highly recommended. Don't miss this show.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I loved this movie.  Just finished watching it and felt compelled to write a review as a tribute.  The acting is terrific.  The fierce Hmong grandmother (Chee Thao) who traded steely glares with Clint Eastwood's character (Walt Kowalski); the selfish relatives; Walt's friends - everyone is wonderful.  Not a false note amoung them.  This film also serves to educate viewers about the role the Hmong people played during the Vietnam war and the consequences they endured.  Something I was ignorant of but am glad to be aware of now.  The many dimensions of this wonderful film have already been covered by other reviews so I'll end mine by saying ..... watch this movie.  You won't be disappointed.
0061673730|5.0|Just started Zen and loving author's tone, descriptiveness, and pace!  He's really focusing on those thoughts we have about everyday situations that we just don't spend enough time pondering.  I'm very excited to read further.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is my first book w/ my new Kindle.  I read the other two books in this group and find this one as interesting.  Some places ae slow as in the other books but most books seem to have places where one must muttle through until some excitment comes into play once again.  These books are 'thinker' books where one must put the puzzle pieces together to follow the story line.  I am enjoying it.
0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett has written an amazing novel of people caught up in world events. In this first volume of the Century Trilogy, the author deals with the years preceding, during, and immediately after the First world War. It is a sweeping design but he pulls it off. It is basically the stories of people who are caught up in this events.  He seems to have paid a great deal of attention to ensuring that the events which swirl around his characters are historically accurate.<br /><br />A long but engaging book. In just around 1,000 pages, he captures your attention and you follow along as his characters deal with the events which shape their lives. Through it, the reader gains an appreciation of the history that engulfed the world during those years.<br /><br />The best news of all: Fall of Giants is the first in a planned trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The book had an interesting premise but failed to deliver an original story.  This book strongly reminds me of the Japanese book Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. In Battle Royale a group of middle schoolers are forced by the government to fight to the death on a small island  The major difference between these two books was the characterization.  Suzanne Collins only takes the time to flush out a few characters and even those are left a bit flat.  Takami manages to bring thirty characters to life and makes the killings believable from the characters standpoint. Suzanne Collins has taken the horror and understanding out of the violence she has written.  Too many of the deaths in Hunger Games didn't provoke a reaction in me.  I grew board of the world she had made, it has just too predicable.  If I am going to read a book about the cold blooded state ordered murder of children, I at least want a bit of horror and reaction.  Hunger Games was just too watered down.
0679731725|4.0|Well, this novel definitely adds a whole new meaning to the definition of what a servant's loyalty is. The main character here, the old-school butler Stevens, is dedicated to his master and to his position to the extent which is quite shocking. Literally everything in Stevens' life - his family, the possibility of love, even his identity - is repressed and is secondary to being a good employee, a devoted employee who worships his master and follows him blindly down any path, regardless of how misguided or immoral it is.<br /><br />As with \\"Never Let Me Go,\\" the power of the novel is not in what the narrator does or says, but what he doesn't. The subtle hints at what Stevens buries inside, what he sacrifices to be what he thinks he ought to be, the level to which his own identity is chopped and impaired to accommodate his life choices, all of it without him even fully realizing it - this is what is so heart-breaking about his story.<br /><br />\\"The Remains of the Day\\" is an excellent exercise at portraying self-deceiving nature of human mind and differences between a personal and objective reality.
0545123275|3.0|As a child, Grace was attacked by a wolf pack and might have died, but that she was rescued by a golden-eyed wolf. Since then, she and her wolf have shared an unusual bond--and now a teenager, Grace discovers that her wolf may also be human. Shiver is an unapologetic paranormal romance, which may come as a surprise to readers who are expecting urban fantasy with romantic aspects and get romance with a side of plot instead. Explicit romances aren't normally to my taste, and I found Shiver offputting at first. But the book embraces its genre so enthusiastically that it's difficult to begrudge: this is a story of soulmates, bittersweet and heavy on the heartfelt sighs, and about as indulgent you'd expect. That isn't to say that the romance is particularly moving, but it is aptly atmospheric: in beautiful blue print, occurring in a vivid winter brought to life by lyrical descriptions, centered around true love, Shiver is a cool, dreamy, idealized tale. With dual narrators the beginning is redundant and slow; it isn't until the 60-page mark that things get underway, but once they do, the character interaction is lovely (Sam is a particular delight) and the romance is lovely escapism. The pacing slows again at the end of the book--in fact, whenever plot eclipses romance, the book tends to flag. But Shiver is a romance at its heart, and as a romance it's a quietly successful guilty pleasure.<br /><br />I would have preferred, however, that the characters were out of their teens. On one hand, Shiver is a realistic portrayal of puppy love; on the other, that very thing invites dismissal: these are silly kids, not starcrossed soulmates. The age of characters also dims the sexual aspect of their relationship, so while there is sex most of the passion is reserved for makeout sessions--which, in a story of life, death, and true love, comes across as weak and silly. If the characters were just a few years older, their relationship would still be youthful first love, but it would have passion and meaning too. In both appearance and style, Shiver is a very beautiful book--but it wants to be something more than that. This is atmospheric escapism, a quiet pleasure despite its flaws, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected I would; I give it a moderate recommendation. But it could have been more, and unfortunately what it is little more than pleasant fluff.sion and meaning too.

030726999X|1.0|I bought this book, but couldn't make it through the first two chapters. It was just too boring and hard to get into. Sorry, but I could not even finish it. Certainly would not recommend it. The writing style is just not my cup of tea.
B002VJ0576|1.0|This in all liklihood is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It looks like it was made in a high school video project; the effects are cheesy and low-budget.  This has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes and appears to have been created just to exploit the success of Robert Downey's movie.  Dreadful.
0385341679|5.0|The author's note above warns you that nothing is as it seems in this final installment of the highly anticipated fever series.  That is no exaggeration.  Fasten your seatbelts everybody, you're in for one heck of a wild and thrilling ride!  I cried. I gasped. I oohed and awed.  At one point, I even raged out loud (b@st@rd! You'll know who that is when you read the book). Then I did it all over again! I couldn't put it down. I didn't WANT to be done with the fever world. I want more!!     An aside: I'm sure I don't have to tell you that you should READ THE FIRST 4 BOOKS in the series before reading Shadowfever, but I will anyhow (just in case you are tempted to skip them LOL)!     As the author herself has taken great pains in protecting her fans from spoilers,and possibly (surely?) lessening the readers enjoyment of discovery, I will refrain from re-hashing the plot.  However, I will say this, Karen Marie Moning has a genius writing style!  I am actually shocked with some of these low ratings.  Even if you don't like that not all questions were answered in this book, the writing is fantastic!! She really has such a mastery of foreshadow, that when you go back and re-read the series (and I promise you will want to) that you will laugh with such appreciation for Ms. Moning's creativity.  She draws you into this fantasy world so utterly and completely, you debate with yourself whether to leave a light on while you are sleeping!     But I don't want to scare you, because ultimately, our heroine, Mackayla Lane, does get a happy ending (or should that be beginning...?) - and so, too, does the reader! Did I get all the answers to every question?  No, but I got enough to leave me extremely happy and definitely wanting more....More, I say!  Bravo Ms. Moning! I can't wait to see what you have in store for us next.
0743270754|5.0|\\"Team of Rivals\\" is a great book on the Lincoln's choice of his cabinet, how he came to choose these men who were at times at odds with each other, and his extraordinary sense of leadership.    I have read much less about Lincoln and the Civil War than I would like, and this book was a great introduction, telling the story of the tumultuous times leading up to the Civil War through the lives of Lincoln, Seward (his eventual Secretary of State), Chase (his choice for Treasury Secretary), and Bates (Attorney General).    What particularly struck me about Lincoln's genius of leadership was his understanding at just how far he could push the country and his cabinet to achieve his goals.  In the process, he received great criticism from those on both sides of an issue (such as the abolitionists and the secessionists), but he was able to understand how a small step forward summed with previous and future gains would eventually result in his end goal (of a reunited union with slavery abolished and equality among all citizens).    I heartily recommend this book for those who want to understand one of the most important chapters in our history and to get a sense of this great man who belongs \\"to the ages.\\"
1607886278|5.0|I'd read many reviews of this book and only thought to read (actually listen to; I got the audio book from itunes) after I'd seen it in people magazine as one of the best of 2010.... Well..... it was definitely one of the best I'd listened to.  I am such a fan of audio books and my commutes are often horrible so audiobooks work.  I don't honestly know if I would have enjoyed the book as much if I'd actually read it... The reader who plays Jack was absolutely PHENOMENAL!!!  This book has given me pause so many times and I was wanting more when I finished.  Imagine all the things we take for granted, living \\"outside\\".  While listening to it over the course of about a week, I found myself hugging my own child a little tighter and really appreciating my family, my work, my friends.  I tell you, many of us parents could learn a lot from the character \\"Ma\\".  She knew and understood her son, really out of circumstance, on a level that most parents never realize.  I've never really prayed for a really long life, just that I live to see my daughter grown and independent.  The rest, well is really icing.... Cake is seeing her grown.  I connected so deeply with the lengths \\"Ma\\" went to to create a sense of normalcy for her son and how she really survived because he lived.    The power of this story is that it is told through the eyes of a child.  Makes an adult really take pause and think.  At the end of the day, if you spend any time at all reading (or listening) to a book, it should at the end reach you.  This one certainly does..... to the core.
1596434252|5.0|This book is delightful.  I read/showed it to our kindergarten and first grade classes and the children were amazed at the authors creation of each letter.  They were excited to see the alphabet in a new and different presentation.  My daughter originally bought this book for her 4 year old nephew.  He loved it.  The pages are fragile but well worth the extra care in viewing.
B000GE07WG|5.0|You have not lived until you read or watch this EPIC!  This was a collectors edition I bought as a gift. and it is pristine. What more can be said...It is one of my favorite stories!
0439023513|5.0|This book captures the horrors of war all to well.  I read it in a single sitting and feel utterly drained.  A wild ride and an masterful work of art.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I loved this series..I was a little disappoionted in the fact that Jonathan Reese-Myers was still lean and handsome even in the end, but that was it.  The acting was suburb! ALL did an amazing job! King Henry was such a weirdo..and egotist that he makes for interesting conversation! loved it!!!
B002I9Z8I0|2.0|I did not like the look of this set in dvd. It is true that once you see movies in blu-ray you will not want to go back to dvd.  The view of these movies suck on my Sony 40\\" LED... However, i have three of the movies in this set on blu-ray and they looked fantastic.  I purchased it because i wanted The Original Motion Picture with two others  and I didn't want to pay the $90 on BR so i went cheap and got the dvd... back they go.  There is no enjoyment for me as i am so used to watching so many movies in blu-ray.  I love blu-ray... better cough up the cash or wait for a sale.  I would also appreciate it if Amazon would package our Star Trek movies with more care and respect.  Every other movie or set i buy is always tightly plastic wrapped.  What is it wit' that.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i simply love nicholas sparks! this book sure did not disappoint. waiting on next one. when i read his books it is almost like watching a movie. great readimg after stressful days!
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Actually, I cannot write a review about this product, because I bought it on behalf of a friend, but you keep sending me notices asking me to do a review.  I saw  Madmen on TV and thought it was excellent.  The copy I ordered was second-hand and friend said that one dvd was faulty, but she says she can get it cleared at her local library.
B001HDWKMA|5.0|Lamontagne is brilliant. His music is a throwback to a time when people cared about what they produced and put it out with some thought and effort and meaning. I wish more people would follow his lead and we could overcome this generation of fluff music that has taken over the radio.
B002JVWQSW|1.0|I thought this show was a BLAST after reading the reviews and knowing it won an Emmy for best Comedy Series. So I bought it willing I was going to have a great time watching it.  However, this is the WORST show ever from ABC. It's pure TORTURE to see an entire episode.   First, the format is annoying by the DANGLING camera swings which go continuously.   Second, for the fact that it shows the pathetic life of 3 pathetic families.  Third, the script is obvious and ultra-cliche.   Actors are very good, though the lines, production and script are hideous. Try to watch the pilot before you buy this.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie was great to watch!  I had so much fun, the action and the good funny lines made it worth it. Ms Helen Mirren is very good in her role, and John Malkovich is simply hilarious.<br />I recommend this film if you like light humor with action adventure.
B004AOECUG|5.0|Back in the 1940's, Jake LaMotta was one of the most talented middleweight boxing athlete in America.  Electrifying and scary, his tactic of getting close to his opponent and punishing them with blow after blow earned him the nickname \\"Bronx Bull\\" or better yet, \\"The Raging Bull\\".<br /><br />But as electrifying and fierce as his style was in the boxing ring, his personal life was full of jealousy, obsession, anger, ignorance and eventually throwing a boxing match in order to get himself closer to the mafia in order to earn a title match.<br /><br />Although considered one of the best boxers in the last century, there was more  to LaMotta's life which was captured in his 1970 memoir \\"Raging Bull: My Story\\".<br /><br />With the success of \\"Rocky\\" in 1976, Americans had an interest in boxing movies and what best than to work on a story that dealt with a real champ who had significant personal issues, a full-length movie adaptation of LaMotta's memoir and who best to direct it than Martin Scorsese, who was riding high from the success of his films \\"Taxi Driver\\" (1976) and \\"New York, New York\\" (1977) and Scorsese and De Niro worked together on the 1973 film \\"Mean Streets\\" (which would be the time when De Niro started to persuade Scorsese in considering \\"Raging Bull\\").  The film would be the first for actress Cathy Moriarty and the second for upcoming actor at the time, Joe Pesci.<br /><br />Although at the time of release, because of its violent boxing content and domestic violence, the film had mixed reviews from critics. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won two, Robert De Niro for best actor and \\"Best Film Editing\\" by Thelma Schoonmaker.<br /><br />But overtime, \\"Raging Bull\\" is now regarded one of the greatest films ever made by film critics including the American Film Institute, the British Film institute's \\"Sight and Sound\\" and various newspaper publications.  Gene Siskel has put the film as #1 in his top 10 list, Roger Ebert lists it as his #2 in his top 10 and France's \\"Cahiers du Cinema\\" has it listed as their #8 film in their worldwide cinema top 10 film list.  Most recently, the American Film Institute has it listed as their #4 \\"100 Years....100 Movies\\" list.<br /><br />The film is so well regarded that in 1990, \\"Raging Bull\\" was listed in the National Film Registry during its first year of eligibility.<br /><br />The film would also be recognized for De Niro's ability of playing a physically fit and toned boxer but then gaining 60 pounds for portrayal of La Motta after his boxing career.  As for Scorsese, he had a major hand in the film's editing and mixing as the director thought \\"Raging Bull\\" would be the final feature film he would be working on (Scorsese was going through personal challenges and wanted to do documentaries).<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented primarily in black and white (with only color focused on the montage wedding video clips of Jake and Joey and La Mott).  But the picture quality is fantastic!<br /><br />You can see details of the character, the sweaty hair, the beaten up face, the blood on De Niro's legs, the film looks great!<br /><br />The black and white footage and the contrast levels are perfect.  The blacks are nice and deep, the white and grays look absolutely wonderful!  A fine layer of grain can be seen and no DNR or artifacting at all.  This is a wonderful presentation of this film and \\"Raging Bull\\" looks absolutely wonderful on Blu-ray!<br /><br />It's important to note that I am aware that \\"Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition\\" is the same transfer as the previous 2009 Blu-ray edition of \\"Raging Bull\\" and some are able to see a translucent stripe on the right side of the screen (which reviewers mentioned in their 2009 Blu-ray review).  I didn't see it but this seems to be a 50/50 case depending on one's hardware it appears or because it shows very few times, people miss it.  I didn't catch it at all.<br /><br />But really,I don't think anyone should complain because the PQ is wonderful!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English Surround Sound.  Dialogue coming from the front and center channel is excellent but it's those fight sequences where Scorsese really wanted people to feel and hear the ferocity, the brutality of boxers.  From the leather gloves landing on flesh, the fluidity of the punches and hearing classic to modern announcers talking about the fight, hearing the the flash bulbs from the photographers, everything is captured remarkably well and making you feel the action with the use of audio.<br /><br />And this extends to crowd cheering ambiance as they scream for LaMotta and boo him when he pretty much gives up on a fight.  Every cheer and jeer, you hear it through the surround channels but it is important to note that because the film features a lot of dialogue, it's a film that is more center and front channel driven.<br /><br />Still, audio is crystal clear!<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Filmmakers Commentary - Director Martin Scorsese and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.<br />  * Cast and Crew Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with cast and crew featuring Irwin Winkler, Robbie Robertson, Robert Chartoff, Theresa Saldana, John Turturro, FrankWerner, Michael Chapman,and  Cis Norman.<br />  * Storyteller's Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Marcik Martin, Paul Schrader, Jason Lustig and Jake La Motta.<br />  * Marin and Bobby - (13:35) A new featurette for this 30th Anniversary Edition, both Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro talk about their relationship and how they work very well together.<br />  * Filmmakers Reflection \\"Raging Bull\\" - (12:15) A new featurette for this 30th Anniversary Edition,Directors Kimberly Peirce (Boy's Don't Cry), Richard Kelly (Donny Darko), Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) and Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men) talk about why \\"Raging Bull\\" is a masterpiece!<br />  * Remembering Jake - (11:04) A new featurette for this 30th Anniversary Edition, members of the Veteran Boxers Association of New York talk about their memories of meeting Jake LaMotta and their experiences with him.<br />  * Marty  on Film - (10:30) A new featurette for this 30th Anniversary Edition, Martin Scorsese talks about his passion of cinema and the making of films.<br />  * Cathy Moriarty on the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson - (6:42) An early interview from 1981 with Cathy Moriarty being interviewed by Johnny Carson about \\"Raging Bull\\".<br />  * Raging Bull: Fight Night - (1:22:32) The making of \\"Raging Bull\\" from how the book became a film, the making of the film, the fighting sequences, outside of the ring and after the fight.

DVD is presented in 1:85:1 widescreen, English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English Dolby Surround, Spanish and French Mono. Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Raging Bull\\" is one of Scorsese's masterpiece which may have not done well in the box office because no one knew how to interpret the violence featured in the film but after time, critics and cinema publications worldwide recognize how \\"Raging Bull\\" was wonderful cinema.<br /><br />Where people expected another \\"Rocky\\", \\"Raging Bull\\" was nothing like that film.  Where \\"Rocky\\" made viewers sympathetic to a man that one would root for, \\"Raging Bull\\" was the opposite.  As viewers, we are forced to be sympathetic to a man who is no angel, who had personal issues and really, a guy that had his own personal inner demons.  A guy that many people feared and didn't want to get on his bad side.<br /><br />Jake LaMotta was not a perfect man.  Awesome boxer in the '40s with an iron chin and a fighting style that really scared those who were in the ring with him but this is not a film just about boxing, this is a film about man's self-destruction.  A man who loses it all by bad decision-making and although the film is loosely based on LaMotta's real life but in reality, as Vikki LaMotta told Jake who was depressed about seeing what kind of man he was, when he asked her was he that bad, her answer was \\"he was worse\\".<br /><br />That's what makes \\"Raging Bull\\" so intriguing because for the most part, people never sympathize with a brutal man, an abusive man but through \\"Raging Bull\\", it's like watching an intriguing trainwreck of how Jake LaMotta lived his life and how this man had everything from a wonderful boxing career, made great money, had a beautiful wife but it was never enough for him.  He wanted more money, he was blinded my jealousy and he lived his life day-by-day and eventually got himself in trouble.<br /><br />And to accurately show this man's life, it was going to take remarkable dedication.<br /><br />This was a story that Robert De Niro wanted to be made into a film.  He started pitching it to Scorsese back when they were doing \\"Mean Streets\\" six years before \\"Raging Bull\\" was filmed.  He continued to persuade him year after year and even told him that he would do everything necessary to get the physique of a boxer and be toned and then gain 60-pounds to show Jake LaMotta after his prime.  That's amazing dedication but for Scorsese, this was a man who was going through personal challenges.  He believed he lost his filmmaking mojo and wanted to quite feature films.  He was not feeling good about his life and when \\"Raging Bull\\" didn't become the box office hit like \\"Rocky\\", needless to say, Scorsese wasn't thinking he would have much of a career afterward.  Especially from the unfavorable reviews it received from the Hollywood Reporter and Variety Magazine.<br /><br />Also, professionals advised Scorsese to not use unknowns but he was dedicated in hiring Cathy Moriarty to play Vickie LaMotta and Joe Pesci to play Joey LaMotta and he kept to that decision because the collaboration between De Niro and Pesci would become wonderful as the two were able to improvise and make it feel real and they continued that with \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"Casino\\".  As for Cathy Moriarty, this person was working at a nightclub in the Bronx with no acting experience but she had that style that complimented Jake's character.<br /><br />And while the acting was magnificent, it was Scorsese along with editor Thelma Schoonmaker that really made \\"Raging Bull\\" literally kick ass!<br /><br />Scorsese wanted to achieve perfection.  He knew very little about boxing but he wanted to emulate it the best that he can but also making sure that every boxing match was different.  And while most actors would complain, De Niro was patient.  He wanted the role and he has an amazing repertoire with Scorsese and no matter how many takes it took, they got the fighting down with some matches being nearly an exact copy of the actual fight (using classic footage, Scorsese worked up storyboards) and Thelma Schoonmaker is one of the best in the business and knows what Scorsese wants but knowing hot to piece together every punch, capturing the brutality of a boxing match and making the viewer see the pain that LaMotta was inflicting or getting himself.<br /><br />With \\"Raging Bull\\", this is a film that features wonderful filmmaking, top notch screenplay and magnificent acting that everything comes together perfectly.<br /><br />And as for this Blu-ray release, yes... a 2009 Blu-ray edition with the same PQ and AQ has been released and is available for quite cheap but why upgrade to \\"Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition\\"?<br /><br />For me, if you are a filmmaker who loves Scorsese's work or a cinema fan that admires his oeuvre, these four additional special features show us Scorsese, the filmmaker and Scorsese and De Niro, their awesome collaboration.  It also is nice to see filmmakers come together and show their appreciation and explaining why \\"Raging Bull\\" was a masterpiece for them and then also hearing from past boxers who have worked or were good friends with Jake LaMotta chiming in.<br /><br />Now does this justify the upgrade?  It depends on you.  Are special features meaningful for you?  If not, then the 2009 Blu-ray will suffice.  Otherwise, if you really love this film and love Scorsese's work and De Niro's work, then yeah... \\"Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition\\" is worth it!  And if you haven't purchased this film on Blu-ray yet, then this 30th Anniversary Edition is the way to go.<br /><br />Wonderful PQ, AQ plust three wonderful audio commentaries, a wonderful making of 1.5 hour long featurette and plenty of special features, if you truly enjoy this Scorsese masterpiece, \\"Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition\\" is a must-own and a must-buy!ul cinema.

B004DK5CYM|4.0|The early '70s, a tumultuous time where Americans were fed up with the war, the politics and wanted to see some glimmer of hope.  From the USA losing to USSR in the Olympics in controversial fashion, in 1973, the year proved to be a magical year as many Americans came together to support a race horse named \\"Secretariat\\".<br /><br />Afterall, it's been 25-years since a horse has won the U.S. Triple Crown and there was so much hype going into this Triple Crown as owner Penny Chenery, a Colorado Housewife and daughter of a horsetrainer, came to take over the role that her father once had as an owner and breeder for racing horses.  As many men didn't think she could do it, with the right people, each of them came to put their belief and for Chenery, she gambled everything in hopes that this horse can win that Triple Crown and in fantastic and amazing fashion, she did.<br /><br />Secretariat was the first horse to win this amazing feat in 25 years and an amazing horse that continues to hold the record at the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes.<br /><br />It has been over 30 years since America has had a Triple Crown winner and many have come close but to lose it at the Belmont Stakes (The final competition of the Triple Crown) and many are still awaiting a new champ, and at times wonder if there will ever be a horse like Secretariat.<br /><br />But let's not categorize Secretariat as any normal racing horse, this one was quite special.<br /><br />Not only because it broke records and because how it gained so much attention from fans to non-fans of the sport, his winning of the Triple Crown was remarkable and memorable as it was televised and the story of Secretariat even continued after his death in 1989 as autopsy has found that his heart was twice the size of a regular horse's heart and is known as an \\"x-factor\\" that only special horses have.  Specifically, the race horse Eclipse who had an enlarged heart from the late 1700's (80-90% of race horses today have Eclipse in their pedigree) and research has found that Secretariat had traces from a dam-line to the daughter of Eclipse.<br /><br />The horse was able to read the people around him, he knew when won, he knew when he lost.  This horse had intuition and he loved the attention from photographers (yes, this horse would pose for the cameramen) and had great stature.  Researching this horse, you can't help but be amazed.<br /><br />But as the story of \\"Secretariat\\" was amazing, the story of its owner and how Secretariat winning the Triple Crown may have not happened if it was not for Penny Chenery Tweedy, the daughter of the late Christopher Chenery who breeded race horses but due to his declining health, was unable to continue his duties at the farm and trusted people to watch over his interests.<br /><br />Penny who was a married housewife and dedicated her life to her husband four children was thrust into a position as a businesswoman who was determined to continue her father's legacy and eventually find the right people to train and race this horse.  She left her family behind, going back and forth from the farm in Virginia and back home.  She only had her determination and the belief from those around her that she can truly make a Triple Crown win a reality.<br /><br />Life was not easy as this housewife from Colorado would have to leave her family over the course of four years off an on to make sure the horse was ready to race and take care of operations of her father's business and to make things even more challenging, her brother and even her husband wanted her to sell the business and horses, because their farm was so much in debt.<br /><br />But Penny Chenery was determined in keeping her father's legacy alive and this is the basis of the movie \\"Secretariat\\", a film adaptation of the book \\"Secretariat: The Making of a Champion\\" by William Nack.<br /><br />The film would feature director Randall Wallace (\\"Braveheart\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\", \\"We Were Soldiers\\"), a screenplayadaptation by Mike Rich (\\"Finding Forrester\\", \\"The Rookie\\"), composer Nick Glennie-Smith (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" films, \\"The Rock\\", \\"Con Air\\") and cinematography by Dean Semler (\\"Dances with Wolves\\", \\"2012', \\"xXx\\", \\"Apocalypto\\").<br /><br />The film which was budgeted at $35 million, went on to make over $59 million in the box office and now the movie will be released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 25, 2011.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Secretariat\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Colors are absolutely vibrant and for a film that takes place in the late '60s and early '70s, the presentation looks very good on Bluray. Detail is quite evident with the paint on the stable, the grime on the jockey's faces, the dirt lifting off the tracks when the horses are racing and overall, wonderful cinematography from Dean Semler.<br /><br />But there is crush that does showup from time-to-time and blacks are sometimes muted.  But by no means is this distracting.  The textures are great and I didn't notice any banding or any artifacting at all.  No sign of DNR and for the most part, this film looks absolutely great on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Secretariat\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English DVS2.0 Dolby Digital, French and Spanish Dolby Digital. \\"Secretariat\\" is pretty much center and front channel driven for the majority of the dialogue-driven film.  But once the races start, that is when the surround channels are kicked into full gear as the announcer can be heard through the surround channels, the crowd gasping and cheering for Secretariat and you can hear the horse's hoof's.<br /><br />You can hear the ambiance of the film (may it be the crowd, in the stable), you can hear it through the surround channels.  So, there is good use of surround channels in this film.<br /><br />Also, the film has its share of '70s music and the music comes quite clear through the front channels.  The music composed by Nick Glennie-Smith (\\"The Rock\\", \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" films\\", \\"Con Air\\") is also dramatic and well-done but if there is one major nitpick I did have about this film, it's the final music used during the Belmont competition.  I felt it would have been better served to use an instrumental song to capture the mood courtesy of Glennie-Smith than using a '70s song.  It just didn't seem right for that moment but that is my opinion.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I wished, Disney has been moving towards a 7.1 lossless soundtrack lately and so I was hoping that \\"Secretariat\\" would have a 7.1 lossless soundtrack.  But for the most part, this lossless soundtrack is very good!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Secretariat\\" features the following special features:<br /><br />  * Heart Of A Champion - (14:56) This feature is on the DVD of the film and the real life Penny Chenery and the actual people who worked with the original Secretariat plus the cast and crew talk about Secretariat.<br />  *<br />  Choreographing The Races - (6:27) This piece looks at how director Randall Wallace and the filmmakers used innovative tools and technology to accurately and excitingly recreate the Triple Crown races that make the viewer feel like they are standing on the backstretch themselves.  For filmmakers, this featurette was quite intriguing on the rigs that were built and how risky and difficult it was to shoot this footage.<br />  *<br />  A Director's Inspiration: A Conversation With The Real Penny Chenery - (21:10) Director Randall Wallace sits down with Secretariat owner Penny Chenery to review the movie and some of the key scenes. Penny reflects on what it was like to have been a woman in a male dominated sport and to have been part of horse racing's most exciting moments in history. Definitely my favorite featurette as Penny Chenery talks about how things were in reality vs. how things were in the film.<br />  *<br />Audio Commentary By Director Randall Wallace - Optional audio commentary from Director Randall Wallace who talks about working on a movie that deals with horses and trying to make horse racing and racing choreography work for a feature film.  A pretty cool and informative commentary!<br />  *<br />  Deleted Scenes With Optional Audio Commentary By Director Randall Wallace - Featuring seven deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Randall Wallace: Alternate Opening, Introduction, \\"Are You A Golfer?\\", No Time To Rest, Memories, Seth Joins The Team and Too Soon To Celebrate<br />  *<br />  Secretariat Multi-Angle Simulation - Relive Secretariats triumphant 1973 Preakness race by viewing the race from a number of perspectives as well as listening to commentaries from fans, announcers and even the jockey who rode Secretariat to their record finish.  A very cool featurette as one can watch the actual 1973 Preakness race and also change to watch a computer simulation and more.  Featured are jockey Mike Smith (3:43) who talks about life as a jockey, reporter Brad Free (5:08) who talks about the idiosyncrasies of a horse, Dennis Mills, owner of the Preakness (3:35) who talks about the history of the Preakness, spectator Mike Calderon (4:14) who talks about going with his father and brother to watch the 1973 Preakness and also included is the actual Preakness.<br />  * Music Video - AJ Michalka \\"It's Who You Are\\" - (4:04) Actress/singer AJ Michalka (of 78violet/Aly & AJ) sings \\"It's Who You Are\\"<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Secretariat\\" comes with a slip case cover and also a DVD featuring the feature film and bonus features.<br /><br />The DVD is presented in 480i (2:35:1 - Enhanced for 16×9 television), English, French, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital.

Everyone had dreamed of having another \\"Triple Crown\\" winner and one wondered if it would happen again anytime soon. After all, people waited 25 years until Secretariat would win in 1973.  And in 1997, it looked like it was going to happen once again nearly 25-years later with Silver Charm but it wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />But although I don't take part in the betting side of horse racing, I do recognize the work that these families who own the horses put into breeding them, training them and preparing them for these competitions.  Knowing the danger for the jockeys, knowing the stress and tear that some of these horses go through in a race, but you wonder if there will be anything close to a \\"Secretariat\\" (and I know some of you will respond with a \\"Zenyatta\\" comment).<br /><br />But one has to realize that this horse, Secretariat, was truly phenomenal not just for its time but even impressive when you see these records that were broken and have not yet been beaten today.  Not only was this a horse that knew instinctively how to win, it was like he was born with the magic touch.  This horse wanted to win and those near him would talk about how he was fantastic, not just as a horse should respond or how a horse should race but since birth, he shown a lot of potential and promise.<br /><br />So, I think that \\"Secretariat\\" was seen as an iconic horse back in the early '70s.  People wanted something to believe with the Vietnam War going nowhere, public moral was literally down and so you look to sports for some excitement of that American spirit.  But in 1972, with the US loss to Russia in the Olympics, needless to say, Americans felt deflated.  So, in 1973, when you had a housewife, but a magnificent business woman taking up ownership and showing us her strength as an owner to one of the best racing horses of all time, putting everything all on the line for  horse in hopes that it would win the Triple Crown and accomplishing this rare and magnificentfeat., it's no surprise that Americans who were fans or non-fans of the sport, tuned in!<br /><br />\\"Secretariat\\" the film was a film that I look forwarded to but at the same time, I wondered how accurately can they portray the Triple Crown in a film?  Are they going to show old clips?  And Diane Lane, how would she do in playing the part of Penny Chenery?  So, many unknown factors with this film and that is where I have to give director Randall Wallace and cinematographer Dean Semler some amazing credit for what they were able to accomplish.<br /><br />The amount of work, risk and challenge these two had along with their crew and their jockeys in recreating and constantly reshooting the racing sequence is amazing.  One can watch the featurette included on this Blu-ray release of how it was all done but even watching how it was shot and how close that camera was to the horses and the jockey, I'm really impressed!  Those were risky shots but they wanted to capture the feel of riding with those horses, especially feeling the speed of Secretariat.  Once, again...impressive!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Secretariat\\" is a wonderful, feel-good movie.  One shouldn't expect anything significant as we know the outcome of the race but it relied in making us believe in these underdogs.  Penny Chenery facing the challenge of being away from her family and putting everything on the line in order to continue her father's legacy is very intriguing.  And sometimes when you have these stories of heroic or iconic athletes, you're used to the banality of these films and how one faces adversity and wins.  But to not become too banal, that it needs to stick out and go further than any feature film that featured horseracing (the last was the 2003  film \\"Seabiscuit\\").<br /><br />Randall Wallace was able to successfully create a film that pays the ultimate homage to Secretariat and also getting things right with the story of Penny Chenery, even if he had to take liberties for the sake of entertainment, he didn't go astray too far and if anything, even the blunt Chenery paid her compliments in the special feature included in the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />As for the film, I enjoyed it a lot.  Was there anything that I didn't like?  Possibly the music selection for when Secretariat was about to win the Belmont.  I would have liked to hear a more inspiring instrumental score versus a commercial pop song. It felt out of place.  But that's my opinion.<br /><br />But there are not many things I can nitpick of the storyline.  I felt Diane Lane was incredible as Penny Chenery, John Malkovich also felt right playing the part of Lucien and everything else, from the screenplay to the cinematography worked smoothly.  \\"Secretariat\\" doesn't strive to become polemic, nor does it strive to be anything controversial.  This is a positive, spirit-lifting film.<br /><br />Otherwise, I felt the movie was very good and possibly the best horse racing movie I have seen thus far.  If anything, \\"Secretariat\\" is a feel-good, enjoyable family film of one of the greatest moments in American culture.  I may have not been old enough to appreciate Secretariat's win at the time but watching this film, I do feel it paid a great homage to one of the great racing horses of all time but also giving a positive portrayal of Penny Chenery and the personal risks she took in making Secretariat's success a reality.  Also, a strong and courageous woman who took on a business which is typically seen as a man's world and for this Colorado housewife, she proved her detractors wrong and came out successful.<br /><br />How awesome is that?<br /><br />\\"Secretariat\\" on Blu-ray is recommended!nd racing choreography work for a feature film.

B002L9PQGG|5.0|This album rocks! Not only did I receive it in time for Christmas, my husband absolutely loved it! It's a beautiful album, and the music is unlike anything out there right now. I would recommend it for anyone interested in a melodic change in their sounds, or for anyone just sick of what's being regurgitated on the radio. This band is WORTH IT!

B000XA5K48|5.0|This movie was wild, raunchy, sexy and hysterical!!! Being a 'girl', I closed my eyes at some of the bloody parts but the rest of the movie was pure entertainment!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I'd seen the movie but wondered if owning the DVD version was worth the cost. It absolutely was! First of all, though, information about the movie: Diane Lane plays Penny Chenery (Tweedy), a woman willing to risk everything and face bankruptcy because of her faith in Secretariat. Her strength and determination make for an inspirational movie, particularly for those who love horses. Until she devoted her time to Secretariat, her primary role in life had been as a housewife. Now she had to take on a world dominated by men, the world of horse racing.<br /><br />Even though many viewers may be familiar with Secretariat's history long before viewing the film, I didn't feel that detracted a bit from the movie. The characters are interesting, are more than one-dimensional and John Malkovich is superb as Lucien Laurin, Secretariat's trainer. He and Lane go head to head in some scenes, both of them stubborn and set in their views. Their goal? To train Secretariat to win the Triple Crown and  pay back investors in the horse. So much depends on every race.<br /><br />Now for the DVD: I'd urge you to get it while you can. The extras are simply superb, with the real Penny Chenery and others who worked with Secretariat being interviewed. Happily, Chenery and Lane were able to work together during the making of the film and there is even a small cameo of the actual Penny Chenery in the movie. The bonus documentary, as far as I\\"m concerned, is well worth the cost of the DVD. But there is far more than that. Other extras include deleted scenes and a music video.<br /><br />This is also a family movie, although it isn't likely to hold the interest of toddlers or very young children. It is one of those special movies which is equally entertaining for both adults and children. In fact I'd have gladly seen it without children along. It stands on its own as an accurate historical recreation of Secretariat's history, with plenty to keep adults enthralled.<br /><br />Even though I'd witnessed the actual Triple Crown races where Secretariat ran for glory, I had forgotten - or never known - some of the details. As Diane Lane and the actual Penny Chenery pointed out, other horses who ran against Secretariat were often excellent. It was a bit sad that they had to run against such an extraordinary horse, one whose likes may never be seen again. In any other year, Sham (Secretariat's main contender) may have gotten all the fame. Chenery had great respect for Sham and felt that Sham was a gallant horse. It is also made clear in the film that both Secretariat and Sham seemed to recognize each other and feel a true rivalry -and perhaps an equal measure of respect -for each other.<br /><br />It is relatively hard to find heartwarming movies for the whole family. This one is especially special because Secretariat had heart and courage beyond even what his owner expected. There is also a surprise revealed upon Secretariat's death - but I'll leave that for viewers to learn after watching the film (it is revealed in the extras).aces where Secretariat ran for glory, I had forgotten - or never known - some of the details.

B00127RAJY|3.0|The workouts are great, but what's with the long introduction?  You can't skip any of it. Every single time you start this DVD, you have to listen to her explain how the 30 Day Shred system works and, \\"There are three levels of workouts. One, two and three.\\"  You see?  I've got the damn thing memorized!  If there are three levels of workouts, how ELSE would they be numbered?! The set up of the DVD is all wrong. Workouts are great, but the DVD quality drives me crazy.
0385341679|5.0|Ok, I freely admit that I am a long-time Karen Marie Moning fan. I have been reading her books since the first Highlander book came out.  I was a little worried about the Fever Series because it was such a departure from her Highlander book formats, but it was by Karen, so how could I resist. I bought DarkFever as soon as it was released and devoured it. The same thing happened with each additional book in the Fever series. BloodFever, FaeFever, DreamFever were all purchased on the first release day and devoured to quickly, then had to wait over a year for the final book, ShadowFever. I must say it was so worth the wait. I have never read a series that had so many heart-stopping moments and left you feeling like you were on the biggest roller-coaster ride imaginable. ShadowFever is the culmination of the most fantastic, wonderfully written series I have ever read.  Nearly every question I had throughout the first 4 books was answered. ShadowFever is the \\"road-map book\\" I have been waiting for.  I loved it so much that as soon as I was finished the book, I started reading it over...it's just so hard to say good-bye to a really good series.  Thanks Karen for all the thrills. This was just such a fabulous ride, I can hardly wait to see what you come up with next....bap7249(Bonnie)
B002ZG994U|5.0|awesome from beginning to end. Does not need the heavy thinking that some movies try to come up with along the same line. Pure action and fun. Nice to see each actor explore the goofy side of their craft. You go in with little expectation and surprisingly walk away satisfied. Would recommend
1400052173|5.0|What luck!  As I was leaving the public library, this book was displayed on the \\"new arrivals\\" shelf.  I took it out and after I read it, I knew I had to have a copy for myself to keep.  I was in medical school in the 70's and we were told the name associated with HeLa cells was \\"Helen Lane\\". (At least we were told something.)     This book is the perfect combination of well described science at an approachable level, a soulful story of a wounded family, and a thorough discussion of history of science, ethics, heros and villians.  I recommend it to anyone; I would make it required reading for scientists.
B004AQPPNM|3.0|This album was a real let down for me. My expectations were high due to how amazing \\"Homesick\\" was.  For the most part, they gave up breakdowns and growls for lighter, melody based songs that will probably get them on the radio (not holding that against them).  But, this is not \\"Homesick\\" or \\"For Those Who Have Heart.\\" If you're in to the more hardcore ADTR download \\"Stick & Bricks\\", \\"2nd Sucks\\", and \\"You Be Tails, I'll be Sonic.\\"
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth gets my vote for Best Actor.<br />Geoffrey Rush for Best Supporting Actor.<br />TRIPLE WOW!  What a fantastic movie!
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|First off, I love this movie.  It isn't necessarily a movie about Facebook, but it does involve it.  The movie is all about best friends, jealousy, betrayal, and other common themes.  I first saw it when it was out in theaters, and second time saw it on the blu-ray.  The second time I watched it I began to see how some of the themes inside the movie can relate to how dangerous Facebook is, such as lack of face-to-face communication and obsession.  The blu-ray makes excellent video and sound quality.<br /><br />On the second disk is a boatload of bonus features, including possibly the best behind the scenes documentary I've ever seen.  I was pleased, as an aspiring filmmaker, to see if follow the entire movie-making process, from table reads, to costumes, to post production.  Another great documentary was about post-production and deciding which takes are best to be used and when to go from one angle to another.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie and the product itself.  Enjoy.
B000S5C02S|3.0|I bought this album because I read a few \\"best of\\" lists from Pitchfork and Spin that listed the Pixies as one of the best bands of the late 80s and early 90s.  I'd never heard their stuff, so I thought I better check it out.      The album has a number of catchy songs and I'm happy I bought it, but the critical adulation seems misplaced.  All the songs sound pretty much the same.  Musically, the band strikes me as one more variation on a long history of stripped-down garage rock combos from the Violent Femmes, Gang of Four, X, the Ramones, all the way back to Buddy Holly.  Lyrically, they're not going for much beyond sly disaffection.  Download the MP3's for a few songs like \\"Here Comes You Man\\", \\"This Monkey's Gone to Heaven\\", and \\"Gigantic\\" and you'll pretty much understand the Pixies and their place in pop music.
B002ZG980U|5.0|What can I add that others haven't already said? Do you like Sci-Fi? Do you like action? Do you like to figure things out during a movie?    A while back, a friend of mine pooh-poohed this movie after seeing it in the theatre yet a couple days ago, had a much more positive opinion when I said we watched it. I bought it with some skepticism after what she had told me originally (without her spoiling it in advance).    So I told my wife what our friend had said....before we watched it...  Then we watched it and wondered if our friend had her head up her butt when she saw it.  I can't give it an A+....but it is better than just an A. This movie is almost fantastic. The cast is great. The story is great. The action is fun. There are some things that were a little predictable, BUT since you're so busy keeping up with the movie, you don't mind it one bit, in fact you kind of enjoy the fact you've figured some of it out just a little beforehand so you can enjoy the action.    and near the end....when you get there....you're busy thinking ok...where in the heck were we....and then whoomp you're there just before you recall....which is nice...and there you are...and you finally BREATHE....because you were holding your breath.    and the best part is that question left in your mind at the end....  Is it Live or is it Memorex? which you'll understand after you see it.    Definitely glad I bought this one as it's definitely worth seeing more than once to pick up what you missed before thanks to the fast pace at times.    Buy it, you'll like it.    which reminds me....yet another movie with Michael Caine that doesn't disappoint. I simply can't recall him ever being in a bad movie and he was actually the deciding factor for me buying this.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|STELLAR movie...This is for the romantics of either sex.....Beautiful story of two people meeting and the effect it had on their lives.....A must see for those that are not only romantic but have a sensibility about life...PS, if you love music you will love the songs in this one.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|FYI, this is not the extended cut like you get on Blu-Ray.  So when you buy, keep that in mind. Others have pretty much covered everything else.    I only brought this up because sometimes they don't always say it's the extended version in DVD like with A-Team, it too showed the Blu-ay version as extended. Well the DVD version we got of A-Team from Amazon actually was the Extended version though it didn't say so in the listing on Amazon like with The Town. I was hoping we'd get lucky with this one as well......no such luck.
8498676029|4.0|My book club selected this book for reading and discussion several months before the movie was released in theaters. It was not only the most popular book among the readers, but it also turned into one of the best discussions we have had. There was no point during the story in which the plot line lagged, and the end of the book lead to an interesting discussion on the readers' perceptions of what happened.
B00316DDWW|5.0|Set Fire To The Hive and All I Know prompted me to purchase this CD.  Nothing else on the cd is like these two songs... and that's okay.    The first time I listened to the whole cd (during my commute to work) I didn't think I had the patience for it.  But I knew that it deserved a second chance.    The second time I listened to this cd I realized there was a lot going on, musically, and a lyrical message that I would be missing if I didn't listen to it a third time.    The third time I listened to this CD I realized that I was reminded of a time when I was a child listening to progressive music like, Rush, Hemispheres and the like, and that there was something to this album that is so special. I knew I had to give it a fourth chance.    I've been listening to this darn album for a whole month now and I can't stop.  It's like some kind of silly addiction...    The time signatures, the polyrythms (drummer terminology) the bass lines... it's freak'en awesome.  The whole darn thing is just freak'en awesome.    I haven't loved a CD in so long and I'm so glad I found something that makes me concentrate on the music on my 2 hour commute (each way).  The production is great... the sounds are just fantastic.    I understand there are two drummers on this album but they play alike and I have to say that the drums are a huge part of this album.  An average drummer would make this just a rock record. But the drums here are fusion/jazz/rock and there are some rythms that just stand out and define this album.    Thank you, Karnivool, for making my commute better.
1594202842|1.0|I wish I had known this memoir lacked any depth or true introspection.      Amy Chua is gifted at writing.  But her piece is purely narrative and sheds little insight into Tiger Moms other than outward behavior.  Pleasant enough to read, but in the end, it is a long treatise for the justification of her own type a behavior.    I am Chinese American.  I had a Tiger Mom. Yes, I recognize the cultural similarities.  The author's family is from Fukien, a part of China close to Taiwan. Yes, I have had parents who criticized an A on a paper rather than an A+.         Ms. Chua's \\"insights\\" are merely for show. There is no critical evaluation of her own motivations, nor any attempt at inquiry at whether her children truly are happy.  Merely a laundry list of accomplishments to add to the authors formidable curriculum vitae.  Apart from fights with her children, the reader has little insight into her children.     It is unfortunate that she does not truly honor those Tiger Mom's sacrifices.  Rather her work is merely a piece of self aggrandizement.  She does a great disservice by generalizing to Chinese parents.      A quick read, but don't expect any depth.
B000O3QQ9M|5.0|now, before you start to get mad and say otherwise, hear me out. personally i feel this is Floyd's greatest album, but mainly because i'm a sucker for classic prog rock, and this is probably their most progressive album I've heard. It may only have 5 tracks, but it really doesn't need any more, because when you are able to just sit down and listen to an entire album side and just be sent to all new worlds pulsating with emotion, you don't forget it easily. not an album that i would listen to on a regular basis, but it is definitely one you can sit down with one day and do notihing else but get lost in the melodies. a truly wonderful album, if a bit short.
B0036OS3ME|5.0|Love these boots! Very comfy and water resistant. I love wearing them on rainy days. I wore them New Years Eve on the beach! Perfect for cold nights on the beach as you can hose them off after.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|The mic clip broke in the first 20 seconds!  Sound went out within the next 5 hours of play.  Also very annoying was the fact that the fabric covering the headphones made my ears very, very hot.  I almost had to wear them half-on/half-off manner.    On the positive side - the sound was good and so was the mic from what I could tell.
B004B8DH98|5.0|Make no mistake, this is not an action movie. Neither is it a thriller. This is a brilliant piece in terms of camera work, background score, exotic cinematography and above all, charm of George Clooney. Do not expect twists and turns in the story. Do not expect to see stunts or action scenes. But if you love the art of movie making, you will love this movie. It's a wonderful experience.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I purchased the blue ray version of this one. WOW! Sting is backed by a full orchestra. He displays his outstanding phrasing by incorporating both old and new songs.  Sound and vision are outstanding. Sting still maintains his high brand of excellence. Great arrangements along with a great back up band. Sting does not disappoint.  If you are a devout fan of Sting, you will want to have this in your collection. Awesome CD. Purchase it. It is a five star and worth every penny. You also get the CD   version of the concert which boasts tremendous clarity and sound. It is a great package. Hats off to Sting and his production crew.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|When I watch this movie I cry my head off.  Of course sometimes thats just what I need :)   This movie follows characters from childhood to adult  Genius film making rarely seen ... done with finesse in slumdog.  Depictions in this movie are sometimes disturbing it   makes you think - these things are likely not fabricated ...    its a matter of chance they happened or not to you or other   characters in the movie ... a reflection on stuggles and   triumps from childhood to adulthood with emphasis on how things   that happen to a person affect them for life and influence  the way they turn out ... facinating ... a movie you can  watch more than once .. A requirement for any movie worth  owning  = D Highly recommended by ED
B002N5N5M0|3.0|Thankfully, the characters in Dexter held up season four. Alas, the writers seem to have lost the plot, rather literally. While this show has always relied on a certain suspension of reality to go with the flow of a very subversive character in Dexter, this season really fell off the edge. I don't know if the writers lost interest? Or running out of creative ways to make this story hold together? The whole seasons story line seemed rushed and ham handed. It felt like shock value over took any nuance to core story arcs. I'm not going to go into details of plot so as not to spoil this season for others who may want to draw their own conclusions. Ironically the season felt like many missed opportunities.  Most of the characters and plot lines were fun ideas that could fit with the dark sensibilities of this show. However, it felt like each of the story lines was not thought through and were rushed and sloppy in how things came or fit together. So many twists and change ups in characters and plots that rather than feeling like revealing shadow sides or more complexity to the show just felt contrived. I'm really surprised to see so many comments lauding the stories and developments this season as it felt clearly to me like the weakest story executions of all the seasons. The characters, including Trinity until the last couple episodes, compensated and it was fun to see them almost more fully embody the characters they have been playing for four years now. It would be nice to see the writers give more consideration to tighter writing of the storylines next season, though I don't have much expectations around this. As others have mentioned, it can be really difficult to keep the quality of these shows high after three of four seasons. Though shows like 'The Wire' and others can provide rays of hope for those of us who appreciate the subversive nature of Dexter.
B003L20ICO|4.0|I wasn't as impressed with this as my family, who all loved it.  I thought the acting, characters, and story were all great...  Really this is less of a review than a rant, so you've probably read enough.  ;)  I gave it 4-stars to balance out my 3-star rating with my wife's 5-star rating.    SPOILER ALERT /SPOILER ALERT /SPOILER ALERT - For those that have already seen it:  How do they manage to make the guy the bad guy here?  He was just a friend with no responsibilities in this relationship, and in the family there was cheating, dishonesty, deceipt... but in end the guy comes off as creepy, and the family gets back together stronger than ever.  That reconciliation made me happy, but at the expense of the male lead just left me confused.
1881273989|5.0|When I gave this book to my 23 year old single daughter she threw it on the table and sarcastically said \\"Thanks Mom.\\" A few days later she returned and told me the book was \\"REALLY GOOD!\\"  It was so good that she said she bought a copy for her friend who has gotten two years into relationships several times and then had break ups.  She though the book would help her friend understand what was going wrong in her relationships. I read it after she finished.  I started thinking about my other children and understanding our relationships better.  I recommend this book for every person who just wants to have better relationships with people whether future spouse, family members, co-workers or neighbors. This book was an easy read and worth every minute of my time!
B003ZK58WM|2.0|Disappointing read.  I was expecting a good,long,interesting read like Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  Unfortunately, Fall of Giants was simply long.  I found it difficult to connect or even like any of the characters.  Sorry Ken Follett, but this one missed the mark.
B000002AGN|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of Brubeck's BEST! The title, \\"Time Out\\" is describing the time signatures used in these compositions....not the usual 4/4 found in jazz, or the 3/4 time found in waltzes...for example,\\"Blue Rondo A La Turk\\" is done in 9/8 time, then alternates with 4/4 time during Desmond's solos...The most recognized song from this album, \\"Take Five\\", is done in 5/4 time. Even if you don't understand all this \\"time signature\\" stuff, you're bound to enjoy the music! All great Brubeck and Desmond performances!
B003QO4BNO|4.0|I generally don't like this episode but there is in my opinion one good song. \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" sung by Mr. Schuster & Puck is amazing. Bohemian Rhapsody by Vocal Adrenaline is OK, but I never have liked that song much. The episode includes funny and touching part by Sue but the songs by Finn and Rachel are not that great though.
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|This is the best movir I ever seen.  This show to us the beauty in the american family. How our life be horrible even where we trust in a good life.    The blu-ray come the same color quality in the DVD. the only diferent is the HD video. But the image look like the same.
0061205699|4.0|In the fictional small town of Maycomb, Alabama, Jean Louise Finch (Scout) lives with her older brother Jem and their father Atticus Finch. An African-American housekeeper cares for Scout and Jem, after their mother has died. One summer a boy named Dill comes to visit his Aunt, while Dill is in Makem him, Scout and Jem try to get a look at their mysterious neighbor Boo Radley (A grown man who hasn't left his parents house in years). Atticus Finch defends a young African-American man after being accused of raping a white woman (Mayella Violet Ewell). After Atticus Finch starts defending Tom is when the Finch family is the object of racial slurs and insults. After the court hearing Tom is accused of the crime by the jury even after Atticus has proved his innocent. This book was written when racism was big; an African-American man couldn't do anything without getting accused of something. And when they were accused they would be marked as guilty even if they were innocent. Author Harper Lee was born in Monroeville, Alabama in 1926. To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960.  The main characters of To Kill a Mockingbird are Scout, Jem, Atticus Finch, Calpurnia, Dill and Boo Radley. The story is told in Scout's point of view, the story takes place from the time Scout is aged 6 to 9, but she tells the story as an adult. Scout is a tomboy who would rather solve problems with her fists than with her head. Scout's older brother Jem who ages from 10 to 13 during the story. He is Scout's protector and one of her best friends. As part of reaching young adulthood, Jem deals with many difficult issues throughout the story. Maycomb attorney and state legislative representative Atticus Finch who is assigned to represent Tom Robinson. A widower, Atticus is a single parent to two children, Jem and Scout. Calpurnia is the Finch's African-American housekeeper. She grew up at Finch's Landing and moved with Atticus to Maycomb. She is the closest thing to a mother that Scout and Jem have. One of the few Negroes in town who can read and write, she teaches Scout to write. Dill is Jem and Scout's neighborhood friend. Living in Mississippi, Dill spends every summer with his aunt. Boo Radley is the mysterious neighbor who tips the children's interest. They've never seen him and make a game of trying to get him to come outside.  Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer and the three acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill and the other two kids (Jem and Scout) become fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without going outside. Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and hates it. She and Jem find gifts left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their game, urging the children to try to see life from another person's perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill's last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the act of escaping. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor's house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout's shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents. Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus's decision, Jem and Scout are the objects of abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch's Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches' African-American cook, takes them to the local black church.  Don't judge someone just by the color of their skin but of their character. That's what this book is trying to teach all the people who read it. Tom Robinson was judged by his skin when sent him to prison and ended up in the death of him. All of that could have been avoided if everyone didn't judge people by the first look. If you want to judge someone, get to know them for who they are not what they look like. \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" is the famous saying that describes what this book is trying to teach.  The book was very good, because it teaches people about racism and why no one likes it. Racism is bad nowadays but in 1960 an African-American man or woman couldn't go anywhere without being discriminated against, which is wrong. If you white, brown, tan, or even purple you shouldn't be discriminated against, skin is not what you need to look at. It's the person's character that's important once you know that you can judge them for what they are.
142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero is an intriguing book that continues off the series of the Percy Jackson Books. After reading this book I was amazed at just how much I had covered in a few days. It is very action packed and if you are a fan of the previous series or any of Rick Riordan's books this book will leave you wanting for more. It starts out fast from the beginning, making you explore the book and analyze each word. Like all of Riordan's books this book contains bundles of humor and will keep you laughing every chapter. My overall opinion on this book is that it is amazing and is a must read for a person who likes greek mythology, action, and humor.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I recently saw this film on dvd after watching the original, \\"Let the Right One In\\". It is a beautiful movie to be sure. However, the remake \\"Let Me In\\" is almost shot for shot exactly like \\"Let The Right One In\\", and it is misleading that it be advertised as \\"written and directed by Matt Reeves. Taking out and changing some minor characters and redoing the opening sequence is all that makes this film different from the original. In any case I loved both films.
B00418NXBK|5.0|As a fan of KOL since Youth and Young... days, I realize the way this band has changed. But I'm not of those who think that aren't as good as those days. Yes, Aha shake.... remains as my favourite one, but this is the second without a doubt. Strong as Because of the times, deep as Only by the night, and consistent and fresh as the previous ones. Excelent album! the best ones: Pyro, Mary, Back down south, Beach side, Pony up, pickup truck
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|I guess this isn't necessarily underrated as much as it is just completely under everyone's radar.  F-ing great show.  If you like The Sopranos, The Wire, Dexter, or shows generally like those...or just have generally good taste and high standards you'll enjoy this show.  One of my favorites.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John and Abigail Adams life during and after the American Revolution and his travels in support of the new Republic is detailed extremely well.  The portrayals are excellent. David McCullough's book has been very well translated to the screen.  Adams is a towering figure (albeit his physical stature was not tall) in the history of our nation. Although he was opposed to slavery in principle, he compromised in order to insure the inclusion of the southern states within the union. This is a wonderful and accurate production.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|... one of my usual impertinent, witty, evocative critiques of this film, but I got distracted by reading a bunch of the earlier reviews, both the five-stars and the one-stars. There are enough prosaic summaries of the script of The White Ribbon in the high-star reviews; I won't offer another. Many of the enthusiastic critics agree in regarding the film as an excavation of the roots of Nazism, a kind of cultural self-flagellation by the German director Michael Haneke. Not so many are willing to acknowledge the open hostility to religion that seethes in the film, which does undeniably blame pietist repression for the disturbances that warp the lives of these villagers. Then there's \\"father hatred\\" as another risky subject; four fathers - a doctor, a minister, a Junker landowner, and his steward - are the central characters, and all of them are brutal self-righteous hypocritical paternalists. The only childless adult male is the village schoolteacher, an outsider who serves as the observer/narrator, whose tentative courtship of a girl young enough to be his student is the closest thing to sweetness in this bitter tale. Poisonous inequity of wealth is part of the witch's brew in this hierarchical hell, also. All three evils -- pietism, paternalism, and feudalism -- were historical realities in Germany in the years before World War 1; the film doesn't exaggerate them. There's no need, I think, to lunge from a harsh specificity -- these people, this place, this time -- to an indefensible generality about Nazism and 'the German Character.' The film is more intelligent than that.<br /><br />The five-star reviews here on amazon tend to be lengthy. The one-star reviews, on the other hand, are typically short vituperative I-want-my-money-back howls of baffled anger. It's tediously slow and too much is left unresolved, they declare. [To be honest, if you want frenetic cuts, cinematically enhanced scenes of action/violence, and plausible solutions to the mysteries, this is not the film you want to watch. And that's okay. If you know you won't like it, don't watch it.] But the anger in these hostile reviews seems deeper than mere dissatisfaction with a slow, somber motion picture that makes no concessions to entertainment. It's hostility to intellectualism in films of any sort. Again and again the one-star reviewers sneer at \\"art\\" films and the pretentious snobs -- liberals, no doubt -- who dare to think they're 'better than us' because they can sit through such trash and claim to see meaning in it.<br /><br />Interestingly, both the five-star and the one-star reviews of The White Ribbon include frequent allusions to the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman; those that praise this film compare it favorably to Bergman's films, while those that hate it rant that it's 'just as bad' as another Bergman. The comparison is appropriate, almost inevitable I think, because of the black-and-white cinematography; if you appreciated the camera work of Bergman's collaborator Sven Nyquist, you'll relish the similar artistry of Micahel Haneke's visual team. Likewise, the editing of The White Ribbon is plainly Bergmanesque. Want a helpful tip? If you esteem the films of Ingmar Bergman, you are sure to find The White Ribbon worthwhile.<br /><br />This Bergman association has brought me a small epiphany, an insight into the roots of the \\"culture wars\\" in the USA today. All the rage-filled extremists of a certain age in America were taken or driven to see Bergman films in the 1960s and 1970s, found them incomprehensible and drab, and then were belittled by their more intellectual friends and/or more sensitive dates, and have been seething with resentment ever since. Aha! Don't you see? So-called conservatism is an inferiority complex! Why, I'll bet you could track voting patterns in recent elections by correlating them to liking or disliking Wild Strawberries or Shame. It's all Ingmar Bergman's fault!you want to watch.

B004IB0N0E|5.0|I have been a long time fan of these guys, and have everything they have ever done. Also, have seen them a couple times live, which was extremely good. After Tolkki had left, I figured they might be done (the output at that time had waned significantly). Then came Polaris, which I was glad to see them continue producing music, but considering how that release was pieced together and produced, it showed and the song writing, melodies, and performances (quite honestly was pretty weak). When Elysium was announced, again I was glad to see them continue on, but had low expectations. Then - WOW! After 2-3 listens I realized that this may be the best thing they have done since Visions, Destiny, or Infinite, and one could even make the argument that this could be their best release EVER. Yes EVER - their pinnacle! Just depends what style within this genre you prefer. The vocals are nearly perfect, guitar playing is supreme, and the melodies, hooks, and overall songwriting is cohesive and melodic. The real gem here is the 18+ minute title track \\"Elysium\\". What a great piece of music! It feels like a 7-8 minute song because it flows so well and effortlessly. If you are a fan of metal, power metal, speed metal, progressive metal, etc. this is a must have. Fantastic job to the band for coming back stronger than ever. Now please tour the US again guys! Enjoy!
B0032KNA4I|3.0|Nice effects-   However, please do NOT believe this as real!  It's the end of an age!!!!   not the end of mankind!   peace-  (its like your car milage, once it gets to 100.000 it flips back to 1 - your car doesnt blow up all of a sudden- :)   STOP BELIEVING ALL THE LIES FOLKS!

B004AKCME8|5.0|The animation in this movie is wonderful. We own a parrot and feathers are truely amazing things .They capture them.This movie was a great family movie , even my husband liked as well as the grandkids. Even the teenage ones : ) It had a good story and was interesting. I had recomeneded it to other families. it had adventure , good character, and happy ending what could be better: )
0618526412|1.0|The return for the time invested in reading this book was a big nothing - I regret picking it up.  One of those books you keep hoping the author will pull together and deliver an \\"ah ha\\" moment - she didn't.  The book simply goes no where.
0385341679|5.0|I have read the entire Fever series and LOVED this last book. If I had to say something negative it would be that I just couldn't stop reading until I finished! This is a book with something constantly going on. I have and would recommend this book/series to everyone.
B003TML0VO|5.0|I love the original recordings of many of these songs, however Led Zepp and T Rex are gone. The only way music has lasted over the centuries is by performance. Every day Mozart and and Beethoven is performed and enjoyed by great musical artists. Why should this not apply to the great composers of recent times? Covering a song is not selling out, if an artist does it their way. Santana clearly enjoyed performing these song, and by using current singers he is introducing them to a new generation. I found listening to them fascinating. It's a different but wonderful experience, just like when Ella does Cole Porter differently to Sinatra. This is a fantastic CD. Open your mind and enjoy the incredible talent on show.
0446563048|5.0|This is a very enjoyable book.  Tony's life is really amazing and inspiring.  I couldn't believe how quickly the book sucked me in and how interested I was in what would happen next.  I've been telling my co-workers about the book and they look at me like I'm crazy to think a book about Zappos could be this interesting.  I would highly recommend it to others.  It changes your perspective and makes you re-examine how you've been working and what's important in your life.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love, LOVE this DVD.  I contribute this DVD to my lean looking arms and my firm butt.  Even my hubby has commented on how my butt \\"doesn't jiggle anymore\\".  When I first started doing this DVD, I struggled with the beginner version of Level 1.  Now I can do the advance version of Level 3 ALL THE WAY THROUGH!  I feel so proud of how my body has transformed.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|this movie celebrates and rewards what it should condemn:  shameless female excess, narcissism, and superficiality and feminized heterosexual men (not gay)who encourage it all.  this whole idea that, in order to be fulfilled, married women somehow \\"need\\"  the selfishness/excitement/fun/freedom of the single life - that men never have without punishment - is sickening . . . and destructive.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|Anyone who has ever been on a chairlift has had those thoughts: what do you do if we get stuck?  What would happen if we jumped?  Could we climb the cable to the ladder?  What would happen if the chair or the cable snapped?    This film operates on the premise that every possible thing (and person) that could go wrong will.      The dialogue is mostly filler and, at times, inane.  After one of the characters finds out the result of trying one of the options above and the rather disjointed bodily results because of it he is amazingly coherent and conversational.      While it does a good job cinematically of tapping into that fear that arises anytime a person goes up on a chair lift (just like the fears arise when taking off in an airplane), once rational thought sets in it becomes clear that it is ultimately an exercise in incredulity.    The movie was all but over when the wolves became the main threat in the film...    A ten-minute \\"What would happen if...?\\" would have sufficed.
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss has put together one of the most comprehensive fitness books ever released. It has information on just about any fitness goal you can think of? Want to get stronger? That's covered. Want to get bigger? That's covered. Want to lose weight, get faster, or even get better at swimming or swinging a baseball bat? It is all in there.<br /><br />There is even a couple chapters on preparing for a marathon. There is even a 3 month plan created by CrossFit's Brian MacKenzie that I modified to prepare me for a Tough Mudder.<br /><br />If you are a fitness enthusiast then I highly recommend this book. Even if you are not, this book can help you become the strongest version of yourself you can be.
B000VS6R26|5.0|The video arrived in a timely manner and was in brand new condition as advertised. I am very satisfied with the entire purchase. Highly recommend this seller.
B0049P0A0W|5.0|Being an avid dubstep fan and gogo dancer, i listen and dance to a variety of dubstep from various artists on a daily basis. It was only recently that I had been shown the wonders of Skrillex, and let me tell you I am extremely impressed. It takes quite a bit to send shivers down my spind, however after hearing Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites it did just that. Sonny Moore's grimy dirty beats will get any crowd going. With excellent bass drops and bumpin house tunes, Skrillex will never dissapoint. Skrillex will also be performing at the 2011 Wakarusa Music Festival in Ozark, Arkansas this June! Dont miss it!!!!!
B00005JKNC|5.0|I have no idea why I waited so long to add The Majestic to our home movie library.  I've loved it since the first time I saw it.  Everything about the movie is quietly powerful.  The story, cast, and set locations are genuinely heartwarming.  The patriotic message will stir the heart of everyone who cherishes what the Constitution truly represents.  The insanity of the Joseph McCarthy Era is displayed beautifully. If you enjoy a well told story, get The Majestic.    There is a good reason the movie is not available in Blu-ray.  The DVD transfer for the 1.85:1 aspect ratio on HD looks almost Blu-ray perfect so why offer an upgrade?  A great movie and a sharp transfer, what more could one ask?
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Wow...what a great movie.  Have the DVD but decided to upgrade to the Blu Ray.  Fantastic action and characters....wraps up the series nicely.  I would love to see a sequel but probably won't happen.  Highly recommend the series and this fantastic movie.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Don't buy this unless you like computer animated cartoons inserted randomly throughout the movie you grew up with.  Also, don't expect the same music on Jabba's barge in Return of the Jedi -- it has been replaced by computer cartoons dancing to music written for divas.  Just say \\"No Originals, No Sale\\".
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I've never been overly impressed by Gary Cooper, but here, he really fits the bill as Howard Roarke. While the film can only serve as a summary of a terribly detailed/complex epic, it does a fine job. But Cooper and O'Neal capture the essence of the leads so well, you cant help but get sucked into the story. Cooper's penultimate courtroom scene is dynamic - a true merger of author and actor executing together. While the world of architects may be foreign to most, the spirit of the film cannot be ignored; while the resolution of the film (versus the book) may be rapidly derived, its impact cannot be dismissed. And the use of black and white is brilliant (But for the best Rand adapatition, look for the Italian version of We The Living).
0307474275|2.0|It must be terrible to be the Pope. You spend your entire life as a priest in dedicated service to the Catholic Church, undergoing years of study and pastoral work, working your way through the politics of the Vatican until you finally reach the top. Then, someone takes you aside into a quiet room and tells you 'Oh, by the way, this whole thing, it's about protecting the secret of Jesus' descendants so that we can make lots of money'.<br /><br />'The Da Vinci Code' is a fairly standard example of the conspiracy thriller genre. These kind of stories about secret religious conspiracies, occult ceremonies, riddles and pseudo-spiritual hokum are one of the staples of airport fiction (along with novels about world-weary ex-spies being brought back for one last mission). In this company 'The Da Vinci Code' is actually a below-average effort, with tissue-paper characters (cardboard being too substantial), weak plotting with an addiction to cliffhangers, and a silly story that plagiarises other conspiracy writings (particularly 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail'). But it can be appreciated as a sort of campy fun, a potboiler to while away a few hours. It's certainly very easy to read, which partly explains its phenomenal popularity.<br /><br />However, 'The Da Vinci Code' has had a double-existence as a publishing phenomenon, crossing over to become a true cultural icon. This is mostly down to good marketing, but also these kind of fads come around every now and again when people are looking for a bit of escapism. This novel also drew in a lot of people who don't ordinarily read much, and are perhaps a little more credulous about the kind of historical claims that Dan Brown makes. There's no need to discuss the veracity of the 'FACTS' presented here. If you really believe that the Priory of Sion exists, I have a bridge that you might be interested in buying. This novel also plugged into the disgruntled ex-Catholic market, obviously a lucrative niche. Dan Brown must have prayed nightly that the Vatican would denounce him so that he could sell another million copies.<br /><br />'The Da Vinci Code' is worth a read, as many other novels of this kind are, but it is surely the most overhyped novel in history. If you want a more substantive example of the genre with some true intellectual grunt, try 'Foucault's Pendulum' by Umberto Eco.can would denounce him so that he could sell another million copies.

B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Got this movie for Christmas and watched it 3 times already.    The new A-team cast is pretty good.    Would have been nice to see more from the old crew.
B001NLKT60|3.0|I enjoyed this second book in the trilogy. It had an exciting storyline and it was a faster paced read than the first. I really liked how the beginning of the book left us with questions and slyly answered those questions throughout the story. I even went back and re-read the beginning and it all made sense.<br /> But it was repetitive at times to the point that I would be reading the same exact email twice that Blomvkist and Salander exchanged with each other. That is unnecessary and bad editing. For some parts, the repetition served as a way to see into each character's psyche and I got that, I really did and it did not interrupt the flow of the story much. It was also very unrealistic at times and made Salander into some sort of invincible heroine. This take on Salander is not very becoming considering the rest of the character lineup is SO human. It sort of changes the entire feel of the book.<br />Overall, it was a better read than the first book and I will finish the trilogy.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I really enjoy watching these episodes.  Everything covered in them is exactly what happens in every aspect of politics from the 60's to the present.  Almost cannot tell the difference between the show and real politics.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Very cute movie, entertaining, a welcome relief from the glut of poor, sex laden, violence espousing genere coming out of Hollysleeze.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|The film's camera chillingly stalks Nina's face and the back of her head. It also shows blurry reflections, not direct visualization, of characters in mirrors, very strange. The setting confines itself to Nina's home and the theater. There's little connection with the outside world and about Nina's bio. But this shows that the film is extremely focused on Nina's constant stress and mental breakdown. Thus, the audience can only sympathize her insanity. In fact, the film metaphorically interprets and visualizes her self-created illusions. The film is very cruel in exploring her misguided imagination. Overall, \\"Black Swan\\" will seem unorthodox and uncomfortable. But that's the main point in trying to explore how the amazing human mind can equally develop a dangerous imagination to destroy itself.
0743486285|5.0|I really loved this book, just sorry I read it so fast! The book is very different from the inner artwork to the way it is written.  I do love the insight into addiction from an addict and a now sober addict. Great read and so interesting.
B003J5UIRS|2.0|This book is just that- mediocre. The writing style is average and uninspired. While I suspect the author is straining for the detached and scientific tone struck so successfully by Dr. Ian Stevenson, this author fails.  His descriptions are just boring. His discussions on the arguments for and against reincarnation are overly simplified and annoyingly pedantic. If you're really interested in this field go to the source- anything by Ian Stevenson. I would also recommend Carol Bowman for a more thorough examination of children's past life memories. I actually skipped parts of this book, looking for the more substantive parts- which were few.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Emma Stone has been typecast as a nerdy high school/ college girl. If you have seen her in other movies, her character is the same in this one. Needless to say, she does it very well, so well in fact when she attempts to act sexy, it doesn't work, perhaps a sign that they had Lindsey Lohan in mind for the part. Emma doesn't want to go camping with her BFF's family so she lied about what she is doing that weekend and later lies that she had sex. (I loved the birthday card from the grandparents with $5.00 in it.) This falsehood is spread around school. Later a guy who is gay asks Emma to say she had sex with him so the kids won't pick on him. At a party, she pretends to have sex with him while nearly the entire student body is outside the door listening. Emma is shocked she now has the reputation as a \\"skank.\\" This is a weak plot point that Ms. Stone makes real for us, as well as pretending to have sex for money with half the school. There is of course the Christian crowd who are more loud and obnoxious than in real life (I think), and Lisa Kudrow who did a lousy job as a guidance counselor, or maybe she wasn't good enough to save a plot with so many cartoon characters and plot implausibilities. The movie was laugh out loud funny and that was only because we did watch all those 80's movies. For those who liked this movie, especially the confrontation with the campus Christians, I recommend the movie \\"Saved.\\" Growing up in the 60's we wanted girls who had sex in our school and didn't attempt to get them expelled. Is California really that \\"uncool\\" now?
0385341679|5.0|Wow! Everytime I thought I had it figured out, I was wrong. Spoiler Alert!! For those complaining we still dont know what Barrons is, let me say it, SO WHAT??? We know who he is and what he's been after and why.  Karen has left the door open to explore where the rest will go. I am so pleased with how she finished this part of the series and with the mental picture she left of Barrons grilling steaks. This book wrapped up ALMOST all of the answers and I couldnt be more pleased. I have read and re-read every book she has written and look forward to re-reading this one another half dozen times!!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|An incredible read. Very well written with nice scientific fact behind it, unlike some other series Brook's zombies are realistic. If anyone likes this I recommend World War Z to them.
B001AQO3XS|4.0|This blu-ray (director's cut) is nice. They have done a decent job in converting the movie to digital, but you can see it is a conversion. There are scenes that the image is not perfect. I will still give thumbs up!

He is so loved in this movie and hopefully the same in his life, as portrayed in the movie.  If you love animals and even if you don't, you can't help but love Hatchi.  I recommend this movie to everyone.
0679422714|5.0|This is a meticulously well-researched and very well written account of one of history's most murderous leaders. It is self-evidently true that Mao's legacy is as bloody as Stalin's, and that is a remarkable \\"achievement.\\"<br /><br />A clear portrait emerges on these pages, well documented and thoroughly researched, which shows Mao to be a sadistic power hungry tyrant on a level with Stalin. Absolutely a must read.

This product seems to work quite well, it did the job and my knife is a great deal sharper.  If you're looking for something to work really well with most knifes, I'd say go with this.

B0044RUSZM|5.0|I was looking for a laptop stand that allowed me to use my laptop as a desktop replacement.  This stand is simple, nice looking, functional and contrary to a review I read, stable.  I suppose, there might be a laptop with a super slippery bottom that might allow the laptop to fall if it is bumped by accident, but honestly it is hard for me to envision any laptop falling or sliding off the stand on it's own.  I am currently using the stand with my Sony Vaio 15.6\\" laptop.  In any case, let me return to my review:  1.  The stand lifts the laptop monitor up to a height that is the perfect height for me.. the top of the monitor is just below eye level.  2.  The design of the stand allows it to not have any side rails so that any keyboard, no matter what size, can be stored under the laptop freeing up the maximum desk space when the laptop is not in use.  3.  The stand is very sturdy and stable.  The stand has a very slight angle forward to counter-balance the monitor screen and expose the laptop keyboard to the user.  The high quality rubber on the solid metal bracing provides a sturdy and stable base for the laptop.  As I stated earlier, I can't imagine this falling or slipping off the stand unless the table is not stable or if it is accidentally knocked off or yanked off by a cable, but this is true of most stands.  There are plastic little tabs that stick up on the front of the stands for a super slippery laptop with a near zero frictional coefficient. ;)    4.  The laptop stand looks cool. The laptop floats in the air.  I have a cable that connects to the second monitor and a USB cable for additional storage, but other than that the stand, laptop, second monitor, wireless keyboard, and wireless mouse create a very functional, cool looking, and clean desktop.  I shopped for a long time for this stand and am very pleased with it.  Oh, the amazon price was substantially lower than what I saw this stand for elsewhere (or even with other vendors on Amazon.)  I hope this is helpful.    Rich
0894803123|5.0|I have been making ice cream like crazy since my grand daughter received these two items for Christmas in NC.  I ordered both items as soon as my husband and I came back to North Platte,Ne.  (actually, it was my husband who insisted we get an ice cream maker,he went everywhere in NP looking for one !!!)  He then asked me if I knew how to order over the computer! ( He's a little challenged when it comes to technology, Ha! )  !Of course,little does he know how easy it is for me to order from Amazon!  (considering I have close to 300 books on my archives for my kindle2)  He's going to give me his credit card,not knowing I can buy with \\"one click\\" --- and that's it!!!  Love it, Ha!  Book and ice cream maker are fantastic.  And the basic recipe was no problem to memorize (considering I've been making it for weeks!)  What more can I say?  Customer service is the best ever, esp. for the kindle. My kindle has a mind of it's own,(clicks to buy when I'm still reading the review!!) So needless to say I spend a lot of time with Kindle reps. Not one has been rude, and they all end of laughing at my problems!    Victoria
B000SGRONM|4.0|This is BY FAR my favorite Sedaris book. It is a quick read for the holidays (or really anytime) and every story is funny- one of the few books that I honestly laugh out loud at, every time!
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I wonder what people saw in this trilogy that I didn't. Most peoples' reviews are like book reports: yes, I understand you read the book, so I need no synopsis as proof. As mystery thrillers, I never felt excited reading these books. There are so many detours of useless characters, sidetracked threads ( Berger at her new job),and needless detail that I found myself feeling more of ' What's your point?' than eagerness to turn the page. I am relieved to know there will be no further books so that I can put this writer to bed...so to speak. BTW, this trilogy really revealed the shotcomings of ebooks to me. With all the confusing threads, I found the need but not the ability to page back to review something from previous chapters. Alas, in the Kindle, the pages are not numbered, so searching for something I read earlier....somewhere...is a very daunting and frustrating task. ebooks are a stark black and white experience that feels like eating dry toast - no cover, no artwork, no texture, and every page of every book looks the same. I could barely wait to read a newspaper.
1594202842|1.0|I did read this book, but did not buy it and never will. It is about a woman who is too self-centered to give child-rearing advice.       I really think that this book should be titled \\"How to Raise an Unhappy, Neurotic Child.\\"  It is more about the mother,  and how wonderful she is for never allowing her child to play with others,  do sports, participate in extracurricular activites.  Poor litttle LuLu is not allowed to be a kid. When she explores or experiments (gee, if you go outside without a coat you are called \\"Bad!\\"   How about letting the kid go out,  get cold and learn that it is a good idea to wear a coat?)   I thoroughly believe most children nowdays do not get the discipline they need and are allowed to be ill-mannered brats.  But providing discipline and teaching manners is light years away from constant punishment for normal child behavior.     And where was Jed the father while all this?  Was he grounded for talking to a friend?       There are hundreds of books in the Abnormal Psychology section about people who are taught that they are unlovable,  and this book is about being unlovable- because there is always another task to perform for the Tiger Mom.
B001JEENV8|5.0|I have fallen in love with Maroon5. I intend to purchase their more recent CDs as well. My kids have always liked them and I enjoy a lot of the music they listen to, but this is the first time I have gone so far as to purchase!
1400079144|2.0|I have a love and hate sort of view of Dan Brown's talents.  I find his writing style less suitable for novels but rather for movie scripts.  But until this nonsense (Lost Symbol), at least I enjoyed the stories themselves, if not the way they were written.  That said, there's a lot to dislike about this book, and not only for the way it's written, but for the multitude of simple nonsense he seems to throw it there just so that he can keep the story together.  I'm going to make this short and sweet, but first, let me be clear: this book was a pain to read!  I gave up on it at some points, simply because I didn't want to waste my time on a book that seemed to be written for no other reason but to make the author money.  There's no substance to this novel, no \\"character\\".  Everything is formulaic, artificial - no spirit - it's full of empty promises.  The Da Vinci Code had everything going for it, good story, good twists, good character development, good \\"flow\\" - great facts and highly entertaining misinformation (it's all good, because it was done masterfully), and all those pretty much made up for Brown's mediocre writing skills.  But in the Lost Symbol, it just doesn't come together at all.  He tries, in fact, he tries so hard it's clearly noticeable and that takes away from the magic.  The characters, including Langdon, have been made stupid!  Sometimes you'll forget he's supposed to be a respected university professor who actually knows a thing or two about his field...but, in this book, he's just like a first year student more eager than experienced!  In any event, that's not even so bad, but one thing that really annoyed me to no end **SPOILER starting--> was how a man's hand was cut off, by a non-professional, and yet he can march around Washington at the end acting like nothing happened. It almost seemed like the author and the editor both forgot about that!  I don't know about the Masons, but as for us ordinary folk, if our hand was cut off by some lunatic,I'd probably die from loss of blood, or have some major issues and at the first opportunity I'd be in surgery - but no, according to Mr. Brown, it was OK for his character to show Langdon around Washington as if he wasn't missing a hand <--end of SPOILER**.  And that was just one of the silly mistakes that made this book resemble a teen-suspense book.  The next Brown book I'll just borrow from the library, after the Lost Symbol, he's not getting my money!

0385528752|5.0|Just for the Fundamental Application Error theory alone, this book is worth the read.     The rubric for successful change is written is such a friendly and comfortable prose with such applicable examples seamlessly woven into it, I'm considering getting the audio version too.     If you've ever wondered why you KNOW what you SHOULD be doing, but you still cannot seem to DO it, this book will tell you.     And if you listen and either/all;   1)decide on a plan of action (direct the rider)   2)Make it fun or give yourself a reward for task completion (motivate the Elephant)    3) break it into small steps (shrink the change/shape the path)    You actually might find yourself experiencing successful change.     Best wishes,   Monika   (who was lucky enough to hear about this book from [...] )
0312370849|4.0|I found this a very interesting book. Reminds me to have empathy and to be kind to people as you never know what they are going through. This book questions morals and shows humanity in it's brightest and darkest times.
030746363X|4.0|I read this book fully prepared to toss it aside in disgust at the end. I work in health care and have seen enough goofy \\"change your life with this one trick\\" ploys, especially regarding weight loss,for one lifetime. Usually if something sounds too good to be true, it is. But I have to say I really enjoyed this book. Sure, it's designed to sell, but there's sound science in it, and it's incredibly entertaining. So. Diet and exercise plans have been done to death, the human guinea pig idea has been done to death as well. What this book manages to do by covering a wide variety of areas from the basic (eating, sleep, sex) to the particular (from improving your running & swimming technique, to the physics of swinging a baseball bat) that it gets you thinking -- what would I like to improve in my life? Where can I find the info I need to work on it and how do I want to measure my improvements? It makes you think just about anything might be possible.

B003EY7IRC|2.0|i looked forward to the conclusion of this series and was extremely dissapointed.  Boring would be the word.

1401307957|4.0|I absolutely love this book. Go through it fast because you want to take in aol the awesome drawings and colors that Danny Gregory puts in this book.then, go througgh it much slower. Savor each page, take in the tiny details, the way he portrays colors so fluidly, how he relies on a loos sketch form that just adds full heart into his work- and the best part, is Danny draws everyday things. There truly is beauty in the most ordinary thing. And Danny shows us that through his eyes his life around him is beautiful. I only gave it 4 stars was because I had hoped that there was more of the book in general, but more on his beginnings. He said that he had only recently started drawing, but his \\"rudimentary\\" skills are far more better than mine. But, he's been at this old drawing thing for longer than me. Just keep on keepin on!
B004DTLK8A|5.0|The first time I heard my new album I was at the gym and couldn't fully concentrate on the music to appreciate it correctly. But once I re-listened to it, I was in awe at the work! Elysium (the track) is one of, if not the best Stratovarius song ever made, my brother loves it so much he has listened to this 18 minute song 30-40 times within a few days. My other favorite on this album is \\"The Game Never Ends\\"     As other reviews have said, if anyone used to love Stratovarius but kind of had their love wane a little since 2000, this album is perfect to rekindle you. I have remained a constant lover of this band but I do agree the last 3 albums under Tolkki were lacking greatly. Polaris and now Elysium are some of the best in the power metal genre and while I loved Timo Tolkki, this proves the band can do great things without him. Matias is an awesome guitar player and Jorg Michael has some great drumming in this album, especially in the song Elysium. Lauri Porra finally gets to show off how good he is on the bass! I think Kotipelto has never sounded better too. Jens is always good, never dissapoints.     Overall album score is 5/5, the Elysium track, rated on its own, is a 10 out of 5.

B004HO6HWA|3.0|Dropping the brooding existential themes and rich character development of its source material, \\"The Mechanic\\" ends up being a preposterous predictable tale of betryal and retribution.  Clearly lacking in creative story ideas, the appeal of this film is in its shameless sleeze. The dialogue is needlessly profane, the characters are trashy with more than a few offensive stereotypes, the sex scenes are sweaty and nude, and the constant bloody violence is shockingly impactful. The fight scenes are most memorable; all being incredibly primitive and brutal with lots of painful enviroment interaction that will have you cringing.   Even the gun play has more \\"umph\\" than usual, the bullets slamming into their targets like sledge hammers.      Unforunately, director Simon West is pretty unreliable when people aren't beating the crap out of each other or blowing their brains out.  Working with a huge budget, he piles on the contemporary action cliches of loud music, fast editing, close ups, and shaky camera work....which wouldn't be bad if he wasn't so damn sloppy. Some high concept stunts and car trashing end up being forgettable blurs of color and sound. And sadly, Statham really can't be his lovable self in this one. Straddled with a more serious silent character, he can't wisecrack during the action and his few moments of thoughtful downtime involve him sitting around and looking dumb. Vertically challenged, chain smoking, over actor Ben Foster is bratty and annoying...as usual. Some great unintentional comedy as he struts around his house listening to an ipod, dancing and having some sort of fit.  In a brief but memorable performance, the ancient wheelchair bound Sutherland is surprisingly touching.    -Dan of dangerdiablogik.com (action/horror/cult reviews)

B0032UYFA6|5.0|Having just devoured all three seasons of this show, I am happy to say that Season 3 is the best yet.  So much changes in this show from season to season - one episode from Season 3 can spoil everything from those that precede it - but it is absolutely worth the time and energy to catch up for the start of Season 4.      Bryan Cranston is simply phenomenal in this series (his work in the \\"Fly\\" episode has to go down as one of the best acting performances I've seen on television) and, this season, Aaron Paul's work as Jesse approaches the same level as his character has become more complex.  After watching the last two episodes back-to-back, my jaw was on the floor.  AMC now has three stellar shows in its lineup (between this, Mad Men, and The Walking Dead) and, in my mind, it currently leading the pack in original series (HBO and FX, you're on notice).  For pure entertainment, Breaking Bad is the best of the network's shows.  Get hooked.

0385341679|5.0|I absolutely loved Shadowfever. There were so many twists and turns, some I expected, many I didn't. That's what makes this book and the series in general so special and enjoyable to me. Shadowfever, like the rest of the series keeps me guessing and entertained throughout.     Shadowfever has a slightly different feel to it, but my far my favorite and not just because it's the last. There was a lot in this book and everything came together without it feeling rushed, and the characters stayed true to the very end. There was no sudden change in personality to create a generic happily-ever-after. It was natural. The ending was unexpected but somehow perfect. Now that I've read it, I can't imagine it ending any other way. I felt closure with possibilities, like a door closing but not locked. Anyone can write a generic, predictable ending, but what Ms. Moning did was give her reader's closure without closing the door on this story. I like that, it keeps the characters alive for me. It keeps the story going even if I can't \\"see\\" what's going on behind that door. Yet. :)
B0037KMHRY|4.0|When I saw the first trailer for TRON: Legacy at the beginning of the year I was immediately impressed by the music in it. I then learned the music was indeed the score and then I learned the score was being composed by the French electronic group Daft Punk. Daft Punk is comprised of the duo that is Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo. It's not an unusual sight to see artists from the popular music world foraying into films. In fact almost every great composer came from that background.<br /><br />So, what was the task at hand here with TRON: Legacy? It was a huge one let me tell you that. Daft Punk had to follow what Wendy Carlos did with the original film. Wendy Carlos is considered to be the mother (or father depending on what time you're talking about) of electronic music. Her score to A Clockwork Orange was revolutionary in a way never thought possible. A decade later she brought her style to TRON. Now fast forward 28 years to today. Daft Punk has delivered a mesmerizing electronic/orchestral experience that carries the spirit of TRON and will blow you away.<br /><br />The score is crafted and structured almost perfectly and never wanders or loses focus. The soundscape is a world on its own for the most part. The \\"Overture\\" introduces us to the grand theme of the film. The music has an echoing of the brilliant electronic scores of the 70's and 80's. Blade Runner by Vangelis was one that jumped to mind. Now let's talk about that soundscape. Like I said for the most part this score has an identity all of its own. However, there are moments where it slips heavily into the Hans Zimmer realm. Many people are calling it an Inception clone. Is it? Not really. The score does have signature Hans Zimmer elements in it. The score was mixed at Hans Zimmer's studio and the composers do thank Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell in the liner notes of the CD. So it is possible that some of those stylings could have rubbed off on Daft Punk, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Is it a Hans Zimmer score though? Not at all. The style and approach are very unique in their own respect.<br /><br />The sounds are grand and vivid just as the visuals are. There is a wondrous enormity to the sound of the whole score. It fills the space from wall to wall with terrific simple melodies. I always say simpler is better. The simpler the sound the larger the emotional effect is. The CD is also expertly arranged. The way the score opens, progresses and closes with a reprisal of the themes is fantastic. \\"Flynn Lives\\" is quite the track let me tell you and will give you goosebumps. Throughout the whole experience the score swells up and down to create waves of intense and emotionally driven music. It was a fantastic ride and TRON: Legacy is definitely one of the better scores of the year.y a bad thing. Is it a Hans Zimmer score though? Not at all.

I love this set because the books have a retro style to them. The only reason for the 4 star and not 5 is that the pages arent binded very well- but I guess thats what you get when you get an older style book, you get older style pages!!!

B00000JR29|3.0|The guitar/synth duo from Bath, England named Tears for Fears  have been \\"around\\" or in existence since about 1981, and are  still performing. Therefore I am surprised that a better  re-issue of Songs From The Big Chair could not have been  concocted by the masterful duo of Orzabel & Smith. Along  with the masterful producer and musicians.    At 1 hour 12 minutes long this CD begins to drag, with it's  mixture of \\"extended\\" tracks and different versions of the same  song. It is quite a journey! But..compelling listening. For  myself \\"Head over Heels\\" is fantastic on the 12\\" extended mix.  The problem is...finding a copy.The bass guitar track sounds  like a garage jam with flair. Full of energy. Most of the CD,  \\"Seeds of Love\\" was a full length JAM. And to be honest Tears  for Fears could have been a British version of Pearl Jam.  Unfortunately they bogged themselves down in the studio, or  even live, with an array of artsy intricate music notation.    Tears for Fears need to release a 2 hour CD with Eddie Vedder  on vocals, and Howard Jones on the keyboards/synthesizers. Now  I would definetly purchase that one. As for this CD, it only  contains memories.The music is sub-standard for a band so  meticulous and well respected all over the world. Somehow,  the magic works but not on this re-issue. Sadly I have to  concede and purchase 'The Seeds Of Love' to spice up my  musical collection, \\"after all'.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Publisher -- It is not clear whether your highly unusual pricing policy for the Kindle version of 'Fall of Giants' is an experiment, a market test, or a bone-headed policy, which may eventually diminish your market presence.    What should be clear, by now, is that there are many, many, people who simply will not buy this book in Kindle format until you do decide to reduce the price -- and you've had about four months now, to find that out.    I would like to read Ken Follett's book on my Kindle, but like those many others, I'm not going to buy it until the Kindle pricing makes sense to me. If I have to wait six months, I'm prepared to delay my gratification -- I'll even wait a year or more, since there are plenty of other books I can buy on my Kindle, at prices that do make sense to me. In this case you only have a monopoly on this one book.    If you reduce the Kindle price at about the same time you introduce the paperback version, and you continue to charge more for the Kindle version, than I would have to pay for the paperback version, I will continue to wait. Eventually, I expect I will be able to buy my Kindle version at a price that I consider to be fair. Unless I've lost interest and given up on you by then.    I'm quite sure you have marketing experts who are trying to maximize 'the volume under the curve' -- i.e. your maximum return on this property. I believe those experts are currently leading you astray -- but I guess time will tell which of us is right.
B0043ISH6O|4.0|I know this review is a little late, but later always better than never. Anyway, here we have Trent Reznor making his feature film debut with his friend and collaborator Atticus Ross. A lot of people may think that artists from the popular music scene foraying into film scoring is a new thing, but trust me it's not. Almost every great film composer working today has a band/rock background. Reznor is a bit different because Nine Inch Nails is essentially a one man band. He literally does almost everything since his music is all electronics and sampled stuff. Atticus Ross has been his producer and programmer and Ross has actually started foraying into films. He's worked with The Hughes Brothers on their short for New York, I Love You and then on their next feature The Book Of Eli. Reznor has always been friends with David Fincher and in fact did the opening titles to Se7en back in 1995. Some of his music was also used by his friend Harry Gregson-Williams in Man On Fire.<br /><br />Fincher is one of my favorite directors and his only weakness in my opinion is the inability to stick with one composer. Howard Shore is the only composer he's worked with twice. I just feel the director/composer collaboration is the most significant and by crafting that relationship over a series of films magical things can happen. I understand Fincher hires composers with different styles because almost every film Fincher has done has been different than the previous one he's done. So do Reznor and Ross fit here? Absolutely.<br /><br />The Social Network is some of the best electronic composing you will hear, and by electronic composing I mean it. There is nothing organic about the score. In fact the entire score was performed by both Reznor and Ross themselves. The central theme heard in the first track is perfect. It's only 3 notes and communicates everything that needs to be said. It's reused maybe only one or two more times throughout the score so a thematic score this is not. It borderlines between atmospheric and ambient.<br /><br />The great thing is that it is modern in the best way modern can be. No real source music is used in the score except for 1 iconic piece of music masterfully arranged by Reznor and Ross. The way the score affected me was that at first I felt like it was indeed scoring the character of Mark then as the film progressed I felt it switched to situational scoring. I don't think the characters needed much help from the score because the writing was so damn good. Reznor and Ross did a great job of not having their score trip up over the writing and the dialogue. A hard task by any means.<br /><br />This score is an amazing debut for Reznor and Atticus Ross brings a lot more to the table than you'd think. I mean the score is almost identical to The Book Of Eli in certain ways so in that respect he has a grounded style to offer. I hope Fincher sticks with these two for The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo because I think they could do a wonderful new take on that source material. The Social Network is definitely one of the best scores of the year to one of the best films of the year.tmospheric and ambient.    The great thing is that it is modern in the best way modern can be.

1582701709|5.0|The title of this review is a quote from the Kybalion, a treatise on Hermetic Philosophy, and one of the original sources for the current incarnation of these principles, The Secret.    The Secret focuses mainly on only one of the more general Hermetic Teachings, the Law of Attraction, and touches briefly on a few others.    There are a total of seven main principles in the Hermetic Philosophy, taken from the Emerald Tablet, and an understanding of all of them both separately, and as a sum of their parts, is crucial to a complete understanding of the principles at play.      They can at first be learned individually, one at a time, through media such as The Secret, but to fully understand any of them, they must all be put together to form an understanding of the larger perspective presented.    As summarized from The Kybalion, these are all seven main Hermetic Principles along with the brief axiom associated with each:    1.  The Principle of Mind  \\"The All is mind; The Universe is Mental\\"  2.  The Principle of Correspondence  \\"As Above, so below; as below, so above\\"  3.  The Principle of Vibration  \\"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\\"  4.  The Principle of Polarity  \\"Everything is Dual. Extremes meet. All paradoxes may be reconciled.\\"  5.  The Principle of Rhythm  \\"To everything, an ebb and flow. Rhythm compensates.\\"  6.  The Principle of Cause and Effect  \\"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause.\\"  7.  The Principle of Gender  \\"Everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles.\\"    The Secret uses numerous sources for its presented theory, but most of the sources used are actually interpretations and explanations of these aforementioned original seven principles, which have influenced nearly every major philosophy on this planet, including most of the religions, in one way or another.  They will sound familiar to most of you.      The Secret is a good place to start for most people interested in this sort of philosophy; its more \\"user-friendly\\" than some of the headier treatises on the Hermetic Principles, though not as in-depth, either.      The Secret provides good, general guidelines to transmute the negative thoughts and feelings we experience, by changing our mental habits, which then changes our perspective on life.     If you would like to experience what it is like to see the glass half full for a change, this is one place to start.    Keep in mind that what you get out of it is equal to what you put into it.    Like everything that requires practice to attain proficiency, one must actually DO the practice to attain the results.  It is impossible to judge its effectiveness for yourself without you actually trying it.  The obstacles to results will be equal to the degree of cynicism that you bring to it, how deeply entrenched you are in pessimistic habits, how fatalistic, jaded, etc.    If you are on the fence about it, barrow it from the library or a friend or relative, and take a look.  If it repulses you, leave it alone, it won't help you.    If you have an epiphany, you are ready to begin changing your life via this avenue.    When you have applied it diligently, and are ready for deeper philosophical pondering, I recommend the Kybalion, or any of the other Hermetic collections.  Like Zen Koans, the axioms and maxims and precepts are designed to spark a deeper resonance within the mind.    Its not there to tell you what to think, it there to teach you how to think.
1400049628|3.0|This books was ... well ... ok. It is a good idea, but it tries too hard to sound like a real survival guide. In so doing, it drags on and on and gets really boring. I love a good zombie spoof, and I enjoyed this book for about 10 minutes.    I also found myself getting frustrated with this book in a nerdy kind of way. There are so many plot flaws in this and contradictions that I found myself arguing with the book. It's a zombie spoof. I should be able to just enjoy it, but it tries too hard to sound legitimate that I have to argue with it.    Zen of Zombie is a much better spoof. A lot more fun to read, and ironically since it is so tongue in cheek, a lot more accurate in its homage to the zombie genre.    While this book was ok, I wouldn't recommend spending your money or time on it.

B0043URV8M|4.0|The Harry Potter series has been interesting from a score perspective. The films have gone through different directors and with different directors come different composers. John Williams started this franchise many years ago and \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" has become a staple sound of the series and the character. Desplat becomes the 4th composer to take over the series following John Williams, Patrick Doyle and Nicholas Hooper. Hooper faced harsh criticism with his scores but I always thought they were extremely good. Desplat is a fantastic composer and his style is very recognizable. So what does Desplat have in store?<br /><br />This score is very very good. It is a very fresh approach from a different voice but befitting as a closing chapter to the series. Desplat's approach here is very somber and mellow. He doesn't have big melodies here We start light and get darker as we plunge into the belly of the whale. The score mostly stays bubbling under the surface with some incredible thematic work at play. A lot of people are saying that he is finally bringing back the series to the John Williams style. False! This score sounds nothing like John Williams and I don't know what they are talking about. Desplat has too much talent to be doing impersonations and what we get here is exactly how Desplat would score Harry Potter. He incorporates \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" very minimally giving you that subtle reminder. Otherwise the themes at play build and work to tell the story in a very lush orchestral fashion. Some moments reminded me of The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button but orchestral instead of featuring solo instruments.<br /><br />The only problem with the score is that it is in fact half a score. We do get a lot of music on the release, but with the film structured in two parts the score is as well. So there really isn't a climax or resolution here. I wish there was because it would have been a lot more memorable if it felt like it resolved. Look at how Howard Shore did Lord Of The Rings. Each score was a separate entity yet they still bridged the films together. Then again the films were structured as chapters instead of parts so maybe that allowed Shore to have each of his scores end with a period instead of an ellipses.<br /><br />What we have here is a great start to what I'm sure will be an amazing resolution by Desplat next summer. Since we're only getting half the story it just feels like we're left hanging and when your trying to grasp onto emotional arcs it makes it hard for the score to be memorable.e was a separate entity yet they still bridged the films together.

B003UESJGK|3.0|I had read an article once in which Baz Luhrmann said that the trick to making his extravagant musicals is to take the most simplistic story and to animate it with songs and sets, thereby giving it oomph and life.     It seems that Hollywood romantic comedies these days function with similar criteria in mind: take the most simplistic story of a boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love-with-girl-because-the-girl-doesn't-love-him-back and set it in extraordinary circumstances. The trend seems to necessary extend to including the characters that must have something grand to fight for and to have love conquer it all. In Love and Other Drugs, Edward Zwick, the director of legendary TV shows thirtysomething and [[ASIN:B000TXZVGQ My So-Called Life - The Complete Series (w/ Book)]] (and my personal favorites Relativity and Once and Again) asks his characters to have the kind of love that battles Parkinson's disease.    Although it's noble and wonderful to have this huge emotion of love be the cure for diseases and the reason for world peace, it seems that the French have it better. The French romantic dramedies aren't about saving the world, one relationship at a time; instead they are about characters that most resemble real people, people who have the smallest problems and the smallest inclinations for a sliver of happiness. In non-Hollywood cinema, the story hardly needs to be grand, the only criteria is that the audience cares for the characters.    Unfortunately, it's very hard to truly care for the characters of Zwick's latest film, the script for which was adapted from Jamie Reidy's [[ASIN:0740750399 Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman]]. Even though it takes two hours to tell their story, the viewer hardly knows who these characters are and is instead told to believe that they go through this momentous transformation by having met each other.    The characters are poorly written and the actors who portray them struggle to bring their characters the honesty and the veracity that the storyline demands. Anne Hathaway is quite impressive, but often too much like her [[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition)]] character, as a 26-year-old girl battling Parkinson's disease while trying to go about her daily life. In the end, Hathaway, who plays Maggie Murdock, an attractive, careless free spirit who doesn't have the freedom from her disease or from her unrealistic expectations of herself, doesn't elicit more than a forethought.     Jake Gyllenhaal is Jamie Randall, a drug rep set on sleeping with anything that has the necessary female body parts. Gyllenhaal has never been sexier than in his role here but he is still short of being a convincing leading man. Gyllenhaal, whose talent is unquestionable (watch [[ASIN:B0006GAOBI Donnie Darko - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0000797IO The Good Girl]], or [[ASIN:B00005JNM3 Proof]] for a showcase of his acting skills), doesn't fit the role of a sly, sex maniac, and failed med student who uses hard sell techniques to get laid. In fact, I would almost be inclined to say that Gyllenhaal was miscast in his part here.     Zwick's direction is ever-present. In one scene, Anne Hathaway squats and then leans across to Gyllenhaal, who is sitting in the bathtub. One can just see the director handing out directions of lean left, lean right, don't forget the audience is looking this way in that scene. That's one of the many instances in the film where the action feels unnatural - too staged, too rehearsed, too tried-and-true.     Except for some (arguably unnecessary) nudity between the leads, the too-tired-and-true routine is the story of the film, i.e., there's nothing new in the film that would add to either the genre of romantic dramedy or to Zwick's already extensive career list of adult romantic movies.     The film is set in 1996, and sadly, it doesn't seem that Edward Zwick has ever left that era.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Hands down best IPOD bluetooth transmitter ever made.  I bought this for using my IPOD (7th generation classic 160GB) at the gym with my Motoroloa SD10-hd's and at work with a comfy set of Samsung bluetooth SBH headphones.  There is NO cutout when running (and jostling) the IPOD.  I saw several other bluetooth transmitters having this problem.<br /><br />The best thing about this transmitter is the range.  It is simply amazing.  100' easy through doors and walls.  I can leave the ipod on one side of the house and walk to the other without getting cutout.  It sips power so I haven't noticed a major drain on the battery when in use.  I can listen to music via bluetooth for 9 hours at work before the battery goes dead.<br /><br />Size is great.  It seemed to be the smallest on the market.  It's solidly built with a firm fit.  I plug it in and it pairs to the nearest headset, not much else to it.<br /><br />I'm not sure there are any cons for this product.

B002ZG98UA|3.0|I've finally watched the latest Resident Evil film. It wasn't great, but it had some pretty awesome 3D effects. Besides that, there are only two other factors that make this movie worth watching.     1. Milla Jovovich kicks ass.   2. The film score is dynamite.     Personally, I feel that the movie wasn't all that great because of the way the characters appeared. Their portrays are completely different from the game. Plus the new characters didn't have much of a role. Nevertheless, I love watching the heroine Alice fight. She's the only thing that make these films worth watching. Its without a doubt action-packed, but my overall rating for this film is 3 1/2 stars. When it was over, the ending definitely left one word in mind, \\"sequel\\". Hope the next film is just as good.
1579126278|5.0|This was my second Agatha Christie novel, after being completely absorbed by And Then There Were None. My new favorite is... I can't say. Both are landmarks of the mystery genre and still talked about to this day, and for me, both were impossible to put down. The early 20th century British prose is a treat, and there's a delight in enjoying stories that so many writers after Christie are influenced by.<br /><br />I never guessed who murdered Roger Ackroyd until Monsieur Poirot was ready to reveal the right clues.

B000VZBCWE|5.0|This concert is amazing. The picture and sound quality are just awesome. This is the tour for The Game, and it has everything from their 1st album up to and including The Game...which i consider their last great cd...definitly worth getting the concert dvd...with bonus Live-Aid performance...This concert dvd is probably one of the best ones in my collection.

B00005JLK1|4.0|During my recent doctor-imposed \\"quarantine\\" I watched a bunch of movies while feverishly lolling around. Me? I just wanted to see Julianna Margulies in an earlier role. In \\"Ghost Ship\\" (2003) Margulies displays that central brace of calmness of character in the face of danger that she so deftly shows weekly in her role as [[ASIN:B003FSTN52 The Good Wife: The First Season]], one of the finest series to ever air on network television.<br /><br />I know Margulies as the stoic, loyal, stalworth Alicia, but one who has a secret heart. On this salvage ship she plays a similar character who loses her cool when ghosts make themselves known. It is kind of good to see this character scream like a little girl when faced with ghosts. Even reassuring. Maybe she is one of us.<br /><br />The ghost ship was reputedly lost at sea during the previous century and harbors more gold than the crew can possibly ever imagine spending. Margulies and the captain (the dark, handsome Gabriel Byrnne) want to tow the ship to a safe place where they can safely claim it before it sinks.<br /><br />The trick of the ship--and it is tricked out with ghosts--is to set one particular ghost per crew member, just the one who will tempt the living one into taking chances and dying. It's an interesting premise. The Margulies character gets a child, the captain gets the captain, a lonely man gets the sultry singer, and so on. However, the child tells the tale of what happened lo, those many years ago when betrayal first set the boat's destiny into action. Greed and betrayal, murder and mayhem, an old, old story.<br /><br />The Margulies character sets out to break the cycle of temptation and end the ship's destructive cycle. It's actually a believable story beset with surprises. You won't guess the ending!

0307588343|5.0|:: \\"Anybody can make history; only a great man can write it\\"  Oscar Wilde.    This book gives the reader the ability of both mentioned above. Lehman Brothers made the top lines but the author's are the ones that gave the reader the ability to read not only the facts and figures but also the behind the scenes intra dialogues and commotion especially at the 31st floor of Lehman headquarters.    Good insight on the decision making process that led Lehman to fail. Good touch upon the human aspect, how it played it's part in this mega failure and most importantly how it created most of the financial problems in Lehman.    Greed,human passions, failure of hindsight and COMMON SENSE are the words that brilliantly describe what  to Lehman and are the words that so tremendously present the whole story, what happened and how it came to happen.    Lawrence McDonald's insider view gives the reader action packed first seat and make him fully engaged, just like being in the trading floor. You can actually hear the voices, you can actually feel the pressure and the stress of the certain days that were the final ones for Lehman, you can actually see how the people at Lehman felt when the iceberg was not so far away,but the boat was not steerable anymore. The collusion was sure but for the captain of the ship, Titanic was too big too fail... ::     A must read section of the book: The final chapter

B000OT8GCQ|4.0|dear john was an amazing book. I have read The Last Song, and this book but i own 3 other books from Nicholas that i will read, Because this book was terrific saddly i watched the movie before i read the book(i know fail), so i knew everything going on but the ending surprised me if you're like me who watched the movie first it's different in the book. especially the ending.     If i were you have some tissues handy it was increddibly sad. Well it starts off with John that is in the millitary comes to visit his dad for his 4 week vacation or 5 week sorry don't remember. Well he goes to the beach and meets a girl named Savannah. so that starts the book off it talks about thier friendship and later on relationship.     But as you know Nicholas has a big love problem in all his books so sadly John has to go back to the military for 2 years. Savannah does love him but it's hard to wait for a guy for 2 years.    I enjoyed this book alot but the only thing that bugged me was that John and Savannah were first friends and all of a sudden they're together. For me that annoys me, over all it was a very nice read.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The item is as described. The fan makes loading/unloading memory more difficult in my Asus P7P55D-E Pro. Amazon shipped the items well and fast. Arrived prior to shipping date stated.

1416914293|5.0|City of Ashes is the second book in The Mortal Instruments series and let me tell you, this book does not disappoint. There was so much action and so many twists I didn't want to put it down. It was an absolute rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />I loved that the characters developed so much more and we learn so much more about them. I really enjoyed that there was a lot more focus on Simon because he is one of my favorite characters. I think it's great they found a way for him to become a part of Clary's new world. All of the characters are so complex. There isn't just one side to them. They feel like realistic people.<br /><br />We also get to find out more about Luke and the werewolves and even meet Maia, a new character. We learn more about the vampires and their transition and we also get a little insight into the faerie world as well.<br /><br />The dialogue is probably one of the best parts of the book. There is so much quick witted banter between all of the characters, Jace and Simon especially. I wonder if those two will ever truly get along.<br /><br />Overall I think this one was far better than City of Bones. I was completely captivated from beginning to end. The story was so incredibly well written. I absolutely LOVED this book and would highly recommend it to anyone!
B00000251N|5.0|Jonathan Livingston Seagull is one of my all time favorite movies. The soundtrack is inspiring, uplifting, and just plain wonderful. Listening to this CD brings me feelings of joy, comfort, and lightness. I love listening to it when I'm driving and recently played it while watching snowfall. PURE BLISS!!!!
B003ELOQCK|2.0|The video is amazing, but the problem is the DVD, during the video playing has a little pause and continuing again.
030745455X|2.0|This book is a sort of astonishing mish-mash of story elements that never quite come together believably.  The character of Lisbeth doesn't behave like the personality that was established in the first book at all.  The difference is striking.  This book has Lisbeth pretty much doing nothing for the majority of the book while she monitors the computers of people actually doing the investigation.  The use of the f-word while Lisbeth is thinking to herself through most of the book doesn't ring true either. Her (patterns of speech?) while she is thinking to herself are very disjointed and abstract.  It just doesn't feel like Lisbeth.<br /><br />Another distraction- the amazing amount of brand names cropping up all through this book- were irritating and unnecessary.  I honestly wonder if they received advertising commissions for them. They receive them for tv and movies why not books?  I am having difficulty putting my finger on it, but I don't believe this book was completed by Stieg Larsson. I believe the author left only notes and outlines and this book was completed by a third party.  I won't read the third book in this trilogy even though I have it.  I enjoyed the girl with the dragon tattoo too much to pollute my memory of it any further.<br /><br />Signed,<br />Disappointed Al
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is such an awesome short film for young children.  I had the VCR tape from years ago and wanted to get the DVD version for my niece and nephew. They loved it!
0399536108|5.0|Loved the book! Enjoyed reading a new way to look at living life the way you were raised to live it! We always tell our children that they can \\"do whatever they want\\" and that they can \\"be whatever they want to be\\" and \\"anything is possible.\\"  However, somewhere along the way as we grow-up, we forget this and do what everyone else does or what we think they are doing...... which leaves some wondering \\"what happened\\" and \\"is there more to life?\\"<br /><br />Chris gives permission and great examples by saying that there are things you can do for yourself to make your work fun and life better for yourself and others. He writes what needs to be written in a time where many were raised by busy parents, to go on and become busy parents themselves. Here is the gentle reminder of what needs to be said for happier lives and more fulfilling work. It's a much needed breathe of fresh air for society right now!<br /><br />I also had the opportunity to meet Chris while on his book tour. I was most impressed by his genuine ability to relate and listen to people. His personal style matched his writing. You knew you were talking to the \\"real deal.\\" He was also very open to listening to people's stories and sharing his experiences with others.<br /><br />I have given this book out to many: people graduating from school, people who are rethinking their life plan (this is at any age), and those who have done what Chris did, realizing there is more to life and have begun the search for themselves and gone on their own personal journey.  This book can help you answer the questions about what you would do or at least think about life differently!!  I highly recommend it!!!!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|If I have ever had nothing to read I always read this book. some of my peers are trying to pay to borrow it first!
B000002LCK|5.0|Substance is a great representation of New Order as a whole in the 80's, from their mellow rock sound in the early years all the way to alternative & synth in 1987. You can't really beat the simplest album art they ever used either. A MUST HAVE for any New Order fan! The version of Bizarre Love Triangle on here is completely unmatched...The 2nd disc is mostly full of B-sides and definately doesn't have the caliber of disc one, but I'd recommend it anyway.
B0043EV774|5.0|This movie is sooooo much better in 3D than it is in its 2D format. If you have the 3D tv set up I'd get this 3D format you'll enjoy the move much more.
B003UESJH4|4.0|For those interested in the British monarchy, and in particular the House of Windsor, this is a riveting and even emotional account of the fact that the king who led Britain through World War II struggled with a terrible stammer. The film brought this home poignantly as it makes clear how very traumatic the king's life must have been, especially after the abdication by his older brother. While Firth gives a splendid performance, however, the film was somewhat spoiled for me by the fact that he does not resemble King George VI in the slightest - whereas the actor who plays the Duke of Windsor bears an uncanny resemblance to that disgraced man. It's a small detail, but for those who care about the historical figures in question it's frankly a slight impediment to credibility.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I went to see Burlesque today and wasn't sure if I'd like it.  I actually loved everything about it and left the theater feeling amazing. The storyline was touching, funny and romantic.  Music and choreography was spot-on.  The first time Christina sang on stage, I was overwhelmed, as in chills and teary-eyed.  This happened a few times to me when she was performing.  That voice is intense, dramatic and just insanely mind-blowing, which is why I'm buying the soundtrack today.  You will be tapping your feet and wanting to dance along through every song.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, go.  You won't be disappointed.  The cast is amazing esp, Christina and Cam Gigandet... awesome chemistry.  Stanly Tucci was hilarious and Eric Dane - hot tamale.  Definitely on my top ten musical soundtracks.
B000002L82|5.0|This was my first New Order album, I got it for Your Silent Face, which was at the time the only New Order song I knew. Power, Corruption & Lies is CLASSIC, a MUST if you're a big fan of the band. The first half appealed much more to me than the second half of the disc, but either way it all fit together very well.   BTW I have the 1990 CD version, the one that isn't \\"loaded with errors\\" and has Blue Monday & The Beach tacked on to the end of each side. Personally I don't mind that they threw the 2 tracks in there, they make the album even better! Age of Consent is as I already said, CLASSIC New Order, The Village is a light & happy song, and 586 is my personal favorite, may I even argue that it's New Order's best song ever. I listen to this in my car over, and over, and over again, it can't stop getting me pumped up.
B002MCJZHS|3.0|Not exiting. Fairly mediocre. The album as a whole has a lot of great continuity and you do get a sense of recurring themes throughout but I don't think there are enough tracks that can stand on their own. You could do a lot worse, but then again you -the reader- should strive for something better.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|I read the book, and I watched the movie, hoping it was better.. I Guess Shutter Island just falls short in my mind.. The story is good until about the middle, where it starts to fall apart. and the ending just makes the entire story not make any sense.. With a better ending, the movie could be great, but it simply falls short
B000001EAQ|5.0|I don't think this is a perfect album, but the songs can be catchy and I like how they didn't try to copy Achtung Baby. I'd say Pop is slightly better than Zooropa for U2's second best album of the 90s, after Achtung Baby of course. This is a rock album first and foremost, not a techno album. There are some sounds that you would hear in techno music, but only function secondary and do not dominate. They also have a rock feel. It all works very well together, and creates a different sound from what you find on Achtung Baby/Zooropa. There's a lot going on.    1. Discotheque (10/10) - Their Top 10 single from this album, and I think it deserves that status. This is one of those catchy songs that will stay in your head.  2. Do You Feel Loved (9/10) - Has a great chorus and the background music sounds great. This is one of the songs that is fairly \\"techno\\" sounding, and it works great here. Better than Mofo.   3. Mofo (7/10) - It's fun to listen to, but not my favorite, and probably one of those songs you need to be in the mood for. This is the song that most sounds like it fits in a club, they went full blown with the techno here. Better than your typical \\"club\\" song. Not too memorable, but not bad either.  4. If God Will Send His Angels (8/10) - Very nice song, but not as good as some of the songs before it and right after it on the album.   5. Staring At The Sun (10/10) - The most classic sounding U2 song on the album.  6. Last Night On Earth (10/10) - Might be my favorite song on the album, the chorus is great. You'll want to hear it again right after.   7. Gone (9/10) - This is pretty catchy, and the instrumentals fight perfect with the vocals.  8. Miami (8/10) - This one really grew on me. It's unique and probably not everyone's taste, but I enjoy it.   9. The Playboy Mansion (8/10) - Kind of sounds like a Zooropa song. The lyrics are pretty creative like with Miami.  10. If You Wear That Velvet Dress (7/10) - My least favorite on the album, I don't really like thefirst minute and a half, but does get better. I like it, but compared to the rest of the album it's the weakest IMO.  11. Please (8/10) - Flows nicely and fits with the rest of the album.  12. Wake Up Dead Man (9/10) - A unique song due to it's darker sound and the distorted vocals. Great way to close the album.
B000CBUSWW|1.0|Caveat emptor!<br /><br />This review is specific to the twin-VHS set of EL CID (Italy/USA-1961) manufactured by Best Film & Video Corp. It is a total dog!<br /><br />Recorded in ELP mode (the worst for quality) and with only a linear audio track (no HiFi), there's just a smidgen of tape in each cassette. In the EP mode, two EL CIDs could've fit on a single tape, so this is also a space-waster.<br /><br />Definitely thumbs down!<br /><br />Worst news of all: there isn't a good VHS version available of EL CID. Despite the numerous Ammy listings, all are from fly-by-night outfits like BF&VC.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just happened to open the first page on a Friday night, which is a good thing as this book and its two sequels consumed my Saturday.  I was skeptical about this book -- a giant fight to the death between children isn't generally my thing (while I understand the literary merit of [[ASIN:B000OCXIRG Lord of the Flies]], it isn't my idea of a fun read).  As a female graduate student, I'm probably not a key part of this book's target demographic, but I enjoyed it regardless.      I bought it after hearing one of my classmates rave about it, and as the kindle edition wasn't too pricey, I decided to try it out.  The writing style was not the kind I usually read, but after I got used to the present tense, I enjoyed it.  The story is compelling and probably the best of the trilogy.  The characters are well developed and easy to get attached to.      This book is certainly worth a read, and after finishing the first one Saturday morning, I promptly bought the next two.
6303224644|5.0|I first saw part of this movie on Turner Classic Movies one lazy Saturday morning ... I missed the first 1/2 hour or so so I didn't get to see the whole film ... I had mentioned to a family member that I saw a bit of it and he bought me for Christmas the 2 disc special edition set ... What a beautiful film ... Set in a time that was much more simple then today ... The cast was simply amazing and the songs were perfectly done ... Judy Garland was wonderful and her version of \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" is just amazing ... This is the way American films should be done ... A simple but beautiful fun classic ...
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The added scenes help set the stage, right from the beginning. The quality of the transfer is excellent, in terms of both video and audio. It's a wonderful accomplishment and I can't wait to see what Cameron and Company do for the sequel(s).  The above notwithstanding, I am nostalgic for the first time I saw the film in an IMAX 3D cinema. It was truly magical and if it plays the IMAX circuit again, I'll be there.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time a few hours ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Disney & Pixar have crafted another wonderful movie with positive messages, and this one is a fitting conclusion to the Toy Story saga.<br /><br />Biblically speaking, there is nothing offensive. There are a few scenes that may be intense for those under eight years of age, but nothing over the top (\\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" and other G-rated films contain scary scenes, but nothing worthy of a higher rating). It earned the G rating, and deserves the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Picture that it's been nominated for (the Academy Awards will be in February). I caught myself about to cry during one scene (for fear of revealing a major plot point, I can't and won't say which scene it was). Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the rest of the cast (minus Jim Varney) return, along with all-new voice casting, which includes the original Batman (Michael Keaton) and my favourite James Bond (Timothy Dalton). I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Have some tissues handy, because you'll need them. (I do wish Mr. Pricklepants' role had been bigger, though). Keep watching through the credits.<br /><br />Though the end of the film subtly implies that this is the final installment in the Toy Story franchise, I sincerely hope it isn't. For all three motion pictures, the writing, voice casting, animation and all the other production values have been top-notch, as you would expect from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, there are parallels between this film and the Christian life. SPOILER ALERT. For instance, a toy echoes a non-biblical worldview (something like \\"We can become the masters of our own destiny\\"), but it's clearly shown where that train of thought leads them. SPOILER ALERT OVER.
0618918248|1.0|Having just finished \\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins, I was expecting something earth-shaking on the level that college campus atheists often elate about when it comes to his \\"scientific reasoning and arguments\\".    Instead, what I find is a number of poor emotional appeals and petitio principii arguments, better known as \\"begging the question\\".    Dawkins throughout the book makes numerous ridiculous claims that require some form of proof, such as his naturalistic worldview, and his \\"Ultimate Boeing 747\\" fallacy. also noteworthy, his petitio principii/emotional appeal claims that there would be less war if religion were eliminated (he backs this up with lots of his opinions which he calls \\"scientific evidence\\"; also, I got a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn if you simply take his word for it), and that the concept of god is \\"tyrannical\\" (while completely ignoring the entire Hindu pantheon, which has an almost pantheist concept of a root-god which has no personal attributes).  You could argue that he solely was attacking christianity, but then this book would be guilty of false advertising, seeing as he says he provides reasons why not to believe \\"A\\" god.     so when all else fails, he resorts to argumentum ad hominem: He calls all religious believers \\"delusional\\" and talks of the atheists as if they're some historically persecuted master race, destined to conquer the world.    Don't buy this book. Dawkins doesn't deserve the praise. However, do read it, so you have enough ammo to ridicule the local atheist in your life who gains all his insight from this vapid creature. (or, recommend them some at least decent non-theist philosophy, Hegel, Bakunin, etc.)
030746363X|5.0|I really enjoyed Tim's book.  He offers new ideas on loosing weight that I have not read before.  I am very excited to try the kettle bell as well as the slow carb diet.  I am very intrigued by the Minimal Effective Dose, meaning maximum results in minimal time.

0385341679|5.0|When Darkfever was first recommended to me 3 years ago, I didn't really know what I was getting into.  I had never read any Urban Fantasy and didn't know what to expect.  I certainly didn't expect a series that would captivate and suck me in to the exclusion of so many other books I've read since.  I didn't expect a series that would make me re-read over and over ...that would make me continuely wonder \\"what did I miss?\\" and \\"OMG what does that mean?\\".  I've anxiously awaited Shadowfever for a year and half, just like so many of you.  And I can 100% say that I was in no way disappointed.  In fact it far surpassed my expectations.  I thought I would get the conclusion of Mac's storyline and maybe hints at what was too come.  I certainly didn't think I'd get the twists and turns the story took ...the roller coaster of Mac figuring out what she was.  There were so many things that happened in this book that I didn't expect ...both some that answered many of the questions that I had and ones thats asked so many new ones.  I never thought we would get the answers to all the questions.  Karen has said numerous times that she was not done writing about the \\"Fever World\\" ...so why would she answers every question now?  I have to admit, that throughout the first 4 books, there were times (sometimes many times) that Mac got on my nerves.  And although she did at times in SF, I was pleasantly and remarkably surprised at how much more I liked her and understood her at the end of this book.  I think sometimes we get confused ... we criticize based on how we would act in that situation, yet forgetting that it's a fictional world.  I think of how many times I shook my head at Mac for not admitting that she was attracted to Barrons ...saying \\"My gosh, I'd be all over him\\".  But in reality, if I was a 22 year old in a foreign country, with my whole world turned upside down and Barrons was there in front of me, being so much more than I ever experienced, I can't say I would have admitted any attraction to him.  By the end of the book, I realized that there are elements of Mac in me ...and I was finally able to say \\"you know, I can see know why she did this, or didn't do or didn't admit that\\".    I see criticisms about how long it took Mac to grow up.  I honestly don't know many 22 year olds that \\"grow up\\" in 9-10 months.  I think many people forget that it's only the fans who have waited 5+ years for the conclusion.  For Mac and the rest of the characters it's been less than a year.  And for Mac, considering the time she's been in faery/the silvers and pri-ya it's been less than that.  So in about 5 months she's dealt with her sister's murder, found out what she was, learned she was adopted, was gang-raped and turned pri-ya and still had to deal with 2 domineering men.  That seems a lot to deal with in 5 months.  I also see criticisms about not finding out what Barrons is.  Personally, that was the one question I NEVER wanted answered.  For me, the perfect ending would have been for him to offer to tell Mac what he was and for Mac to say \\"it doesn't matter and btw, I'm staying here.\\"  I can understand the desire to know and understand that the readers really felt that was important.  But with 8 others like Barrons, I'd rather read their stories and maybe learn what he is a little further down the line.  Overall, I think that Shadowfever is an epic end to an amazing series,  with characters that will captivate.  Thank you Karen for an amazing ride!!!
144471449X|5.0|Funny, I read the first 3 reviews by librarians and folks interested in YA literature and they all panned this book.  My daughter loved it and can't wait for the second installment!  Maybe it is more appealing to the kids than the adults...as it was intended.
B0042RJWTM|1.0|This is a great movie, and my review is simply to warn others that the DVD is only 99 minutes long, while the full movie is 106 minutes. Why they cut scenes from movies for DVD release, I don't understand, but most of us who like movies, like the full run time edition. They did the same thing to Blood Simple.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Yes, this film depicts brutal violence (especially towards women),emotional depravity and a procession of lost souls. But there are many touching moments of quirky humor and fleeting tenderness. This film is decidedly not sentimental and is not trying to give the feel-good take-away that some silly, unworldly reviewers on these pages seek. It is, instead, a masterfully created piece of artistic cinema portraying painful realities and real lives that are on the edge. The characters repeatedly just miss on making real connections with each other - It is one of those painful, voyeuristic experiences that strangely makes one appreciate life all the more - and feel grateful that one, at least, still has the opportunity to get things right. Oh, and the acting is ASTOUNDING.
B003ASLJPY|5.0|From the moment I started this film, I was completely enthralled at the contrast between the normal men and the brutal military code that drove them during this hopeless battle.  Regarding the men, there are absolutely wonderful characters.  You have the fictional baker, a seemingly weak man whom the viewer believes will probably survive, who makes friends with a supposed Kempetai he could not trust; the fanatical sub-commanders who sometimes force their men to suicide; the general Kuribayashi, who saw further than his colleagues and had a wider vision of the world yet persisted in his duty to the end.<br /><br />The most important thing for me was that I empathized so much with all of these men.  It may sound strange, but I lived in Japan and came away with an extremely negative view of its society, which enabled me over the last 20 years to take some pretty rigid stances about it.  In particular, I have felt so disgusted at the brutality of their behavior in China, which the Ministry of Education officially covers over (to this day portraying the Japanese as victims of the war), that I felt we were justified in the way we attacked them in the war and to make some blanket generalizations.  This film has gotten me to question my lack of sympathy for the Japanese who fought, even the misguided fanatics who killed their own men for nothing.  Yes, the Bushido code was twisted to the designs of a militaristic regime, but until now I have wondered how human their soldiers were.  This is the gift that only great art can bestow.<br /><br />REcommended with enthusiasm.
0439023521|5.0|Okay, this book? Amazing. I found myself really getting to know Katniss and Peeta, and actually sorta dislike Gale (I prefer Peeta's character, haha).    Rue... There aren't words to describe what emotions ran through me when I read her death scene. I'm a sixteen year old male who doesn't cry easily, and I almost did.     I'm excited for the next book, which I'll hopefully get today.    In short, it's got the action of a sci-fi novel/movie. It's got some dry humor. But, to me, most importantly, it has thoughts. Katniss and Peeta don't just kill the others and feeel happy. They have actual emotions, and I think that's what Suzanne Collins impressed me with the most.    A must read for anyone who loves books.
B004I9TQLI|5.0|Outstanding film. 10/10.    What a heartbreaking, brutal example of an important point that unfortunately needs to be reiterated often.     The Holocaust is a testament to what happens when a person dehumanizes someone who they perceive as worthless, a lesser being and/or some kind of threat.     Propaganda is a powerful tool that can fuel the smallest battle - between a few individuals or even the majority of a nation - by convincing them that they need to conquer someone else.     To strip someone of their most basic human rights by enslaving them under the threat of death is the epitome of evil. It's terrifying to know that it has been a reality so many times throughout history. It can happen to anyone.    Racism and narcissism are alive and well. Who are we to decide that someone is less valuable and important than we are based on their appearance, life circumstances, religion or ancestry?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's simple. No original versions of the first three films, NO SALE. And for those who actually think it doesn't matter, they obviously have no concept of film history. These remakes are NOT the movies we fell in love with all those years ago. The three original films deserve to be released in the new format. What is so hard about including both versions in the boxed sets??????
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I have left comments agreeing with those who were not overly impressed with the latest fever novel.  However, I feel the need to put my weight behind the ratings, as well, indicating I was not enraptured with the final book.  Not tight enough, too much going on that had no real relevance other than to mention characters from previous books.  It was okay and that's the best I can say.  Just didn't do it for me.
B004L9HXJW|5.0|I love the Vampire Diaries. All of the episodes are great, but this episode was sad,because it showed that damon cared for someone else besides himself, katherine, elena, and stephan. I loved the euthanasia type scene when he killed rose to relieve her pain and misery. The Vampire diaries is waaaaaaaaaaay better than Twilight and true blood. I hope they make a motion picture movie one day.

B004KPQK2S|4.0|This is about a horse which is probably the greatest.  Record breaker in every triple crown race.    Something here about how everything coalesces owner, trainer and groomer.  This makes a team that makes the talent (the horse) even better.  If you have ever worked with a horse or trained a horse, you will enjoy this movie.  I'd also recommend that you watch the Belmont Race on YouTube and see what this horse did.  For others outside of racing, I think you would get an understanding of what a team can do and how to put together a team.  For those who are a member of a team, I think you can see the accomplishments of a member of a team.  For those outside of racing, I think you can see a little bit of what people admire about racing, a horse that does the spectacular.  Not all are Secretariats, but on a good day you can see a horse do something beyond their capabilities.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This sequel of BAND OF BROTHERS lives up to the original with flying colors.  The hd is dazzling, the characters finely drawn, the action scenes riveting, and the total experience extremely moving.  It is a great example of the modern anti-war genre that probably started with PVT RYAN and THIN RED LINE, continuing on through the two excellent Clint Eastwood Iwo Jima films. This new breed of epic looks at war in a far more realistic fashion than the old Hollywood propaganda-filled comic book imitations that had John Wayne saving the day with some super-human act of valor, this mini series recreates moments of battlefield history with incredible detail.     A lot of strong performances and consistent leadership from a collection of directors makes this fall strongly in the winner's column. Big Spielberg/Hanks production values are everywhere. A wonderful extra is the enhanced viewing option, which replaces a conventional commentary. It has newsreels, interpretation by historians, and a ton of picture-in-picture interviews with the actual people who inspired the characters in the film.  It adds layers to the film and emphasizes how monumental the undertaking actually was. But it increases the overall running time of the set from ten to twenty hours.  But, when it's over, the urge to start it all over is three. Very impressive.
B004FN16DS|4.0|The author of this book, a professor of economics at Cambridge, is decidedly pro-capitalism.  He just sees some of the inefficiencies and problems with the orthodox economics that bills itself as neoclassical and enjoys much prestige in the academy and in the halls of government.<br /><br />Ha-Joon Chang is a Capitalist, but he wants capitalism with a human face.  In each of these 23 separate \\"Things,\\" he challenges economic orthodoxy.  He sets it up with the common knowledge at the beginning with a section of \\"What they tell you\\" and then spends time refuting the common knowledge with a \\"What they don't tell you\\" section.<br /><br />Each of the Things is targeted and precise.  He knows what he is writing about and he writes it well.  You don't even need to read the book chronologically - he even sets up ways to read the book according to your own line of inquiry.<br /><br />If you are familiar with heterodox economics, many of the issues raised will be familiar.  In fact, the will be familiar to both Austrian and Marxian critics - they're similar in source but your own heterodoxy seems to stem from the conclusions you draw from the deficiencies in the standard model.  Mr. Ha-Joon Chang finds the middle way, and that is admirable but in a way acting as an apologist; there are problems, but we only need tweaks on the edges.<br /><br />I find myself on the edge in evaluating this book.  For me, it is a fantastic repository of information that could serve as a quality reference.  However, I feel that several of the \\"Things\\" could be expanded to further their argument.  A couple of them called out for books of their own.  I still don't know if that is good or bad.
0385341679|5.0|I have to say 1st I have been a KMM fan for SO  many years ~~~ and how very upset I was when she went with the series, because not only was it in 1st person, but it was more urban fantasy than romance, with no HEA in sight.  I resisted, and didn't read the series until this year.  And OMG, what I had been missing out on!!<br />The Fever series is amazing, and totally broken open my expectations for myself of what I enjoy reading.  It takes you to a world ~ our world, only not ~ where the walls between Faerie and reality have come down, and we walk beside beings as old as time.  I loved every minute of the adventure, and fell in love with MacKayla Lane, her benefactor Jehrico Baron's, the whole cast of family & characters we come to know over the course of the books ~~ and was thrilled with this last book, with how the tale is wrapped up, the way our questions are answered, and the possiblilites that are left open.....  I was SO sad to finish this book.  My first thought was no more Barons?  I fell in love with him, and can't imagine not getting more of him in another book.<br />Don't make the mistake I made, thinking because you're a romance purist you won't enjoy these books ~~ they're wonderful, magical, and filled with a story that will whisk you away before you know it.  And the romance IS there ~ it just builds slower.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Unlike some of the reviews, I find this latest Morton book completely satisfying on so many levels. Ms. Morton's talent in putting words together in an intriguing fashion, in taking the reader back and forth from era to era, and the way in which she leads the reader deeper and deeper into the lives of the Sisters Blythe, Tom Cavill, and Edie and her parents makes for a lovely read. I must admit, I didn't see the ending coming. I got to the last several pages, and the tears began flowing. I thank Kate for a enthralling trip and eagerly look forward to her next book.

Whether it's science, curiosity, or humanism that brings you to read reviews of this book, don't let is pass. Just get it and read it and let it change you. :) Peace
6304806426|1.0|Everyone in the entertainment business knows that there is a sucker born every minute and you can sell them a lot of product. Nonsense that pushes certain buttons can succeed spectacularly. In this movie, a 99% burn patient is dragged with the army, from Egypt to the front line in Italy. For several years. Never getting better, never getting worse; but surely using up all the morphine. In fact, he must be addicted. You see, usually, you evacuate patients somewhere far beyond the front lines? You don't bring them with you? You leave them behind. Then an army nurse decides she has had enough of whatever it is and is not coming to work anymore with the army. They can carry on whatever it is they're doing advancing north on Germany. She is taking the morphine and is going to live in a villa in Italy, and take care of one patient only; the one they have been draggin around for years. Some one does say: Desertion. Well, it's, desertion? That's, desertion, question mark. In this army nobody knows anything. She knows what this is all about and she says: fiddlesticks! Well, that's the army for you. When you have had enough, just pick a nice villa and commandeer it for yourself and tell your commanding officer to shove it, they will just have to carry on this bothersome war without you. Now the people who thought this was a great movie, should watch \\"Black Narcissus.\\" Another fairy tale for the young at heart, but actually on a higher artistic level, and even much nuttier!

If you're an audiophile and have a critical ear, then give these a shot.
B00005ASGG|5.0|A pure masterpiece by Ford on how the Wild West was replaced by civilisation.     Fresh from law school a naive Jackie Stewart arrives in a minor town where he expects his work as a civil servant will be close to life on the East Coast. To his surprise he discovers that he is going to cover a very large area where the law currently is not worth the paper it is written on.     The town continually suffers from a gang led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), who is only held in check to some degree by a few individuals like John Wayne.     This is one of John Wayne's saddest movies as he slowly and painfully becomes aware that he is a man of the past - just like the Liberty Valance he despises.

0380789035|5.0|I have bought 4 copies of this book since it came out. The first three have been passed around and read so many times that they have all fallen apart. This story isn't for the impatient by any means, at 624 pages you have to commit. It does drag in places but the ending alone PLUS the characters you meet along the way are really great and you cant help but cheer for shadow as the book goes on. It isn't the greatest thing he wrote but the book is great.
B0009NSE2E|4.0|The Italian Job keeps you hooked the entire time you are watching it.  I like to think of it as Oceans 11 lite.  The all-star cast gives the characters even more depth and range.  The action scenes are good, the comedy keeps the movie from feeling like a revenge saga.  Over all, one of my favorite feel-good comedic action films.  Worth the price of a ticket.

B003YK42LQ|4.0|Just five albums into their recording career, Kings of Leon is a completely different band than it was seven years ago. With the 2003 release of their debut album Youth and Young Manhood, the Kings emerged as the latest torch-bearers for Southern garage rock. They sounded like a combination of the Strokes and Lynyrd Skynyrd, with often unintelligible vocals and a straight-ahead rock sound. They honed that sound on the 2004 follow-up Aha Shake Heartbreak and reached new heights on their best album to date, 2007s Because of the Times, which showed them experimenting with new sounds while maintaining their heavy-rock sound (Black Thumbnail, McFearless, Charmer and Camaro are tremendous ass-kicking rock tunes).  While achieving great success in England, the band basically maintained a small but devoted following in the United States. That, of course, was until 2008s blockbuster on both sides of the Atlantic Only by the Night made them international superstars.  Buoyed by U2-esque anthems like Use Somebody and Sex on Fire, Kings of Leon sounded little like the rough and tumble rockers of their first two releases. Many longtime fans used the dreaded word \\"sellout\\" when describing the more polished sound. I'm actually a fan of both versions of the band, but I actually prefer the Kings' last three albums over their first two, simply because the songs are more developed and catchier as a whole.  Their latest release,Come Around Sundown, continues Kings of Leon's progression into a huge arena rock band. The first single \\"Radioactive\\" is the type of tune U2 used to turn out with ease but hasn't mustered in at least a decade. Big guitars reminiscent of the Edge coupled with a massive singalong chorus give it a bit of a gospel feel, and it's one of the best tunes on the album. There are a few stylistic departures, including the doo-wop flourishes on \\"Mary\\" and the down-home country charm of \\"Back Down South.\\" The Followill clan (brothers Caleb, Nathan and Jared with cousin Matthew) keep maturing as a band, with the rhythm section of Jared on bass and Nathan on drums giving many songs a needed kick in the arse. Caleb has always been a dynamic frontman, adding an emotional edge and theatrics to tunes like \\"Pickup Truck,\\" \\"The End,\\" and \\"No Money.\\" The one thing that Come Around Sundown and its predecessor don't really do is rock, and each album could have used a few stompers like Black Thumbnail to add more variety. But U2 (who they seem to aspire to be) often didn't rock hard but wrote majestic anthems that have stood the test of time. Kings of Leon aren't quite there yet. Lyrically, Caleb is no Bono, but they keep getting better as a band and hopefully will come up with another album as good as their third sometime soon.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I ordered this based off of reviews from others, and just started watching it today.  I have already watched two episodes and am HOOKED!  The first episode is basically introducing the characters, but still has an entirely wonderful sense of wit, while the second one really gets the ball rolling with the story line, foreshadowing, and laying out the show pattern.  There are clever lines, and wonderful actors all the way around.<br /><br />Really glad I found this little gem, and looking forward to watching more of it!<br /><br />I'll post more updates as I watch it, but I'm really thinking this might just become one of my new favorites!  I'm also a fan of The Middle, Better of Ted, etc.<br /><br />-Hannah
0439023513|4.0|i discovered the hunger games over a week ago and i was hooked. i started late tuesday night and finished the trilogy by saturday morning. i can honestly say i fell in love with the characters and i wanted everything to work out for them.    what i WISHED someone would have reminded me is that this is NOT a love story. it's not. it's about war and what's left over after war. it's about how you move on, can you move on?     so for everyone looking for a happy ending to the gale/katniss/peeta... don't hold your breath.     i HATED this book when i finished. i was depressed for the rest of saturday. for the next week, i went over the entire book in my head. i was obsessed even though i was so angry.     what helped was going onto forums and looking at what other people had to say and how they felt about it.    it was such an incredible book for it was able to affect me in such a strong way. after a week of thinking about it and even rereading some chapters, it turns out that i loved it. it was a great book and i ABSOLUTELY recommend it to everyone.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Damon Medic Says \\"Toy Story 3 is an outstanding movie! It is full of surprises, that to share, would spoil a lot of the movie for first-time viewers.  There are some hilarious exchanges between Barbie and Ken, and there are some tremendously suspenseful moments as well, that I believe are too intense for kids under 10 years old. For more mature children and adults, it packs a punch that is a great addition to the Toy Story Legacy, with everything set up for another sequel!  ---Damon Medic
B00328G4V6|4.0|It's amazing Jimi Hendrix produced so much music in a very brief period of time. Forty years after his oh so untimely death, new albums are still being released. OK, so many of these posthumous releases are somewhat repetitive, but at least the music is in the proper hands to do these releases justice. A few years ago, the Hendrix family acquired the rights to his music, resulting in tasteful packages that would make the master proud.  Janie Hendrix, the legendary guitarist's stepsister, said there's enough material for a decade worth of releases, and if they approach the quality of the most recent album, Valleys of Neptune, which came out earlier this month, I'll be on board.  Hendrix put out just three studio albums in his lifetime (all re-released in pristine sound quality the day \\"Valleys\\" came out), with the last one, Electric Ladyland coming out in late 1968, almost a full two years before his death.  However, Hendrix was constantly recording in the final two years of his life, mapping out which direction he wanted to go next. He broke up his power trio, The Experience, (the final days of that band are documented on nine of the 12 songs on this album) in April 1969, eventually teaming up with Buddy Guy in the Band of Gypsys and recording a bevy of blues numbers in this time.  He also was working nonstop on his next studio album, which never saw the light of day because he passed away before he could release it. He had two albums worth of material, much of it haphazardly released over the following decade in inferior packages such as The Cry of Love, Crash Landing and War Heroes.  This was finally taken care of in 1997, when Experience Hendrix put out the wonderful First Rays of the New Rising Sun which is reportedly what Hendrix wanted to call his fourth album.  But I'm getting off track here (easy to do when talking about a true legend). The music on Valleys of Neptune provides a snapshot into everything Jimi did best. There are re-recordings of some of his earliest work, which he felt was rush-released and needed tweaking. New versions of \\"Stone Free,\\" \\"Fire,\\" and \\"Red House\\" are every bit as good as the originals, and in some ways better. (He takes out the cheesy \\"move over Rover\\" line in \\"Fire\\", for instance). There are blistering blues originals like \\"Hear My Train A' Comin\\" and \\"Crying Blue Rain\\". A few songs are clearly skeletal versions of more popular tunes. \\"Lullaby for the Summer\\" is an instrumental based on the kick-ass riff that would become \\"Ezy Rider,\\" one of his finest latter-day tracks. And \\"Ships Passing in the Night\\" contains elements of the later tune \\"Night Bird Flying.\\"  Also included on the album are a pair of wonderful covers. Jimi takes the Experience through a version of Elmore James' \\"Bleeding Heart\\". He even tells the band \\"I'm gonna do this just like Elmore James\\" in the intro of the song. Hendrix also leads the band through a blazing instrumental version of Cream's signature song, \\"Sunshine of Your Love.\\"  But perhaps the best thing on the album is one of the rarest tunes, a song available only to the shrewdest of bootleggers, \\"Valleys of Neptune.\\"  For a song I'd never heard of, I didn't expect a ton. But it's a great tune, with fully realized spacey lyrics about a far-away land and of course, the always present mesmerizing guitar work.  For Hendrix fanatics, the album is a must. And for those who have never heard the master, it's a decent place to start (although any of his four studio albums are still better). More than anything, it proves that even when Hendrix was messing around in the studio, he produced better music than most people on their best days.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|When I was four years old, My parents took me to the theater to see \\"The Sound Of Music.\\" The effect it has had on me, my life, and my dreams is something that cannot be measured!  I bet I have seen this movie at least 30 times (no lie) and I have loved it as though I am seeing it for the first time all over again! Julie Andrews is absolutely wonderful, and who cannot get choked up when Christopher Plummer sings \\"Adel Weiss\\"?  The music overall is touching and well-written, and never fails to pull at the heart strings!  \\"Climb Every Mountain\\"  is a message that holds true for dreamers of all ages.  Buy this three disc set to show your children.  Maybe their lives will be forever changed as mine has been, because I never stop hearing the \\"sound of music\\" in my heart!!  --Damon Medic
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Slash has recorded four albums since he left Guns n Roses - two with Slash's Snakepit and two more with Velvet Revolver - but this self-titled release is the first bearing his name only.  Since Slash can't sing, he went the Santana route and recruited an All-Star roster of singers, mostly in the hard rock/metal vein. He did throw a few curveballs into the mix, like the track \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" with Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas and \\"Gotten\\" featuring Adam Levine of the pop group Maroon 5. But there are the usual suspects you'd expect - Ozzy, Lemmy Kilmeister, Iggy Pop and Chris Cornell, to name a few.  The proceedings kick off in fine fashion with \\"Ghost,\\" a track done with Ian Astbury, former lead singer of The Cult. It's a driving rocker with a kick-ass groove, one of the best songs on the album.  Ozzy's song \\"Crucify the Dead\\" could have been better. Slash's playing, as it is throughout the album, is spot-on, but this song doesn't really go anywhere. It's not a rocker, it's not a ballad. It falls in the middle ground, and while Ozzy's singing is good, it's just not what it could have been. Maybe my expectations were too high.  On the flip side, my expectations couldn't have been lower for his track with Fergie. Usually, I like her work about as much as a root canal followed by a vasectomy, but the song actually rocks. Yes, it's a bit poppy (as you'd expect from Fergie), but the track drives along well and is quite catchy with plenty of hooks. One of the better efforts on the album.  \\"Back from Cali\\" is the first of two efforts with former Alter Bridge singer Myles Kennedy, and it's a decent track - nothing all that great although Kennedy certainly has an amazing vocal range. The second song with Kennedy, \\"Starlight,\\" is much better and really gets stuck in your head.  \\"Promise\\" with Chris Cornell is another song I expected a bit more from, only because I'm a huge Cornell fan. This song is quite good, a little on the softer side. Although I would have preferreda rocker from Cornell, this song is a solid effort.  Another big-time highlight is \\"By the Sword,\\" an epic track done with Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale. This song could have been a lost Led Zeppelin track, it starts off with a bluesy acoustic riff and eventually morphs into a heavy dramatic rocker, and Stockdale delivers the ham-fisted vocals with typical flair.  Needless to say, \\"Gotten\\" with Levine is the worst song on the album. Way too wimpy and boring, it's a ballad that literally goes nowhere until Slash momentarily saves it with an awesome solo.  Luckily, Lemmy livens things up with the next song, \\"Doctor Alibi.\\" A hard, grimy rocker as you'd expect from the Motorhead singer, it gets things back on track in a hurry.  The only instrumental on the album \\"Watch This Dave\\" is another heavy dose of rock provided by Slash, former GnR bassist Duff McKagan and Dave Grohl. The song goes through a few cool musical changes and rocks all the way through.  \\"I Hold On\\" could have been an outtake from Kid Rock's last album \\"Rock N Roll Jesus.\\" It has the feel of many of the slower songs from that album, and while it's solidly performed, it doesn't leave much of an impact.  \\"Nothing to Say\\" with Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows is another heavy burst of rock. It's got some awesome playing from Slash and Shadows is a fine vocalist for this kind of track. They work well together and it's another highlight.  \\"Starlight,\\" as mentioned before, is a real vocal spotlight for Kennedy. A bit bluesy at the beginning, he really wails as the song goes on. It gets better every time I hear it.  \\"Saint is a Sinner Too\\" features Rocco DeLuca and some cool acoustic Spanish guitar playing from Slash. Unfortunately, the song isn't all that memorable. DeLuca has a good voice, but that can't save a boring song.  The album closes with the simply awesome \\"We're All Gonna Die\\" with Iggy Pop. A true F-you kiss-off song, it rocks in every way. Slash's playing is fierce on this one, and I'm glad theyended the album on such an adrenaline rush. Classic stuff.  There you have it, a track-by-track run through of Slash's album. There were three or four tracks I'd consider filler, but the rest of the album is very good and a few tracks really kick ass. Overall, a fine solo effort from the man with the top hat.
B001L4NJIO|5.0|The Police play the songs perfectly while breathing new life into the material.  They are still a remarkable trio and now sound more seasoned.<br /><br />Sting's contribution appears flawless he sings the songs to letter (his voice sounds great) while playing meaningful bass.  There are also passages where he really leans into the bass running some serious notes.  Andy Summers covers the gamut from down right fierce to subtle and melodic, incredible multifaceted playing on his part.  If you are familiar with The Police music then you know Stewart Copeland plays a gazillion notes using his entire kit.  Mega fills, accents and poly rhythms etc. at sometime blazing speeds.  In this show he does not seem to miss a nuance and looks like an Einstein professor type while doing it, awesome!  They really look like they are having a good time playing together.<br /><br />The staging and lighting is no nonsense, clean set up and well lit.  Good collective footage of the band.  Also, the photographer captures each musician realistically and focuses long enough for you to get a good understanding of their individual contributions. The video quality is excellent.  The extras are shot well and give you a decent behind the scene understanding of how the band interacts.<br /><br />The audio quality is superb.  It is potent and natural, crisp highs, clear mid range and the low frequencies are done exceptionally well.  Notes from the bass guitar and kick drum/s (when Stewart throws with the double pedals) are deep and articulate.  The surround mix is tasteful making for a realistic concert experience. The CD recording of the show included with the package also has great audio quality.<br /><br />Whether you are or not a Police fan this is an excellent concert blu ray to have in your library.  It is so nicely done that you will watch it time and again, use it to entertain and as reference material.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|There aren't too many songwriters around whose unreleased output comes close to matching their well-known works. Bob Dylan is one, as evidenced by his \\"Bootleg\\" series, still going strong today. Another is Bruce Springsteen, who left some truly outstanding work on the shelf for years because the songs didn't quite fit into the themes of the albums he was working on at the time.  He gave fans a glimpse into that treasure trove of rarities with the 1998 release of the four-disc box set, Tracks. That set spanned his entire career up until that point, and most of the songs held up extremely well to the ones that were released.  Now comes the much-awaited release of The Promise, a double-disc set of leftovers from 1978s classic release Darkness on the Edge of Town.  Darkness was an extremely important album for the Boss, the follow-up to his first megasmash album, 1975s Born to Run.  The follow-up took three years to generate, mostly due to contractual problems and difficulties with his former manager. That three-year wait between albums allowed Springsteen to record four albums worth of material. He eventually pared things down to 10 songs for the album's release, leaving behind a plethora of worthy leftovers.  Some of these were given to other artists to record, such as \\"Fire\\" (a huge hit for the Pointer Sisters) and \\"Because the Night\\" (a big hit for Patti Smith). Others finally saw the light of day on Tracks, and finally we get to hear 22 more on The Promise.  Let's just say, it's well worth the wait for any Springsteen fan. Included on the set are Bruce and the E Street Band's versions of \\"Fire\\" and \\"Because the Night,\\" as well as an alternate version of the Darkness standout \\"Racing in the Street.\\"  The other 19 tracks are completely new to me (although diehard fans have heard them on bootlegs through the years), and most of them are first-rate.  Overall, I prefer the first disc over the second, as more of the upbeat tracks are on Disc 1, including \\"Gotta Get That Feeling,\\" \\"Outside Looking In,\\" and \\"Rendezvous\\". Overall, the second disc has more of the slower, brooding numbers, but they are all very well done, and many of these are growing on me. I especially like the album's closer \\"City of Night,\\" an honest interpretation of what life must be like for the cab drivers and ladies of the night in major cities.  While The Promise might not be as good as classic discs like Born to Run, Born in the USA, Darkness on the Edge of Town or The River, it shows Springsteen in peak songwriting form. Several of these could have been hit singles, but they just didn't fit thematically for Darkness. I'm glad we get to hear them now, as The Promise takes its place in the Boss' canon as the great lost Springsteen album.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|The series itself is great, and being able to watch the episodes in the correct order is a treat. The DVD format is a pain in the but there isnt a play all option and you have to hit the enter button like 3 times to view an episode. All in all its a quality purchase if you are a fan despite the annoying DVD menus
B00192IV9U|4.0|I still find it strange that Michael Jackson is no longer with us. I grew up listening to his music, and genuinely felt bad for the guy as he suffered a tremendous fall from grace with multiple scandals involving alleged child molestation (I really don't believe Jackson did anything wrong except use bad judgment, as he should have known just about any family of his many Neverland visitors would want to extort money from him).  All the negative press and Jackson's increasingly bizarre behavior often obscured the fact he was one of the greatest entertainers of all time, and throughout the 80s and into the early 90s, the true King of Pop.  In the last decade of his life, Jackson retreated from the music scene, occasionally releasing new tunes on hits collections or boxed sets, but no album since 2001s largely forgettable Invincible. At various times, it was reported Jackson was crafting a follow-up to that album, but no music ever was issued.  His death of a drug overdose robbed him of the chance to put out an album the way he would have wanted, as he was notorious for taking time between releases until he got things just the way he wanted them.  Following his death, Sony announced a 10-album deal with the Jackson estate to start putting out Michael's unreleased tunes.  The first of these albums, simply titled Michael, came out today. Many of these tunes were his most recent songs, although a few date as far back as Thriller.  It's a concise 10-song album, certainly not vintage Jackson, but much better than Invincible. For one, the album's 10-song length makes it feel more focused than the meandering 70-plus minute mess of Invincible. 1995s History and to a lesser extent, Dangerous, also could have used editing, as chopping off schlock like \\"Childhood,\\" \\"Gone Too Soon,\\" and \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" would have made those two albums considerably stronger.  The one thing those three albums did have over this one were true killer songs, as there's nothing on Michael that screamshit single. Some of the production by Teddy Riley, John McClain and \\"Neff U\\" Feemster is a bit dated, but it's awesome to hear Jackson's voice in full glory again.  I've listened to the album three times, and there's not a weak tune here, although there's no kick-ass tune either. Jackson explores his problems with fame and tabloid journalists in tunes like \\"Monster\\" (featuring a welcome rap by 50 Cent) and \\"Breaking News.\\" This was a common theme on Jackson's last two releases, but it doesn't come off quite as bitter as it has in the past. (I Like) The Way You Love Me has a catchy hook, and the Lenny Kravitz penned (I Can't Make It) Another Day is the lone rocker on the set, featuring Dave Grohl on drums. The last two tracks, \\"Behind the Mask\\" and \\"Much Too Soon\\" date from the Thriller era, and they're two of the best songs included. \\"Mask\\" includes many of Jackson's trademark \\"hee hee\\" vocal inflections, while \\"Much Too Soon\\" is a simple ballad featuring Spanish guitar, harmonica and even a touch of accordion.  Michael is more an album for fans, and longtime admirers will be happy with what was done here. Hopefully, the coming vault releases will be done just as tastefully.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|Some music is best heard in stereo; Pink Floyd comes to mind.  I love old mono recordings, too.  I have fond memories of AM station KOMA breaking through the airwaves late at night with its \\"One Hit Wonders\\" show.  That mono sound had a warmth that just can't be reproduced in stereo.  The Original Mono Recordings presents Bob Dylan's first eight albums -- the bedrock of his legendary canon -- in mono.  So, the music is classic.  Is it better served by stereo or mono?    The answer is, in my opinion, both.  I find that some of the mono versions, particularly most of the rock tracks on Bringing it All Back Home and almost all of Highway 61 Revisited, have a drive and punch lacking in the stereo versions.  And, I must agree with many reviewers regarding the mono John Wesley Harding.  It is superior to the stereo version, bringing out the bass without being overwhelming and giving these songs even more of an Old Testament feel.    Some songs are better served in stereo.  I felt that the mono versions of \\"Queen Jane Approximately,\\" \\"Just like Tom Thumb's Blues,\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" fell flat.  While the mono Blonde on Blonde is good (hey, it's Blonde on Blonde), the stereo version is far better.    Mono is often not necessarily better than, or worse than, stereo; it's just a different way of hearing music.  The Original Mono Recordings is a worthwhile purchase for fans and neophytes.  It's a fantastic way to get some of the most important music of the last fifty years in one package.  I enjoy the differences in sound and will probably trade off between my mono and stereo cds as the mood strikes.  Well, except for John Wesley Harding; I'll probably stick with mono on that one.
B00004RE0E|4.0|This album represents a trip down through the 80's stadium rock/power-ballad era for those of us who may care to remember those times. Interestingly, certain songs have found favour once more in the popular mainstream (Don't stop believin') and upon hearing again actually sound quite good (in a \\"guilty pleasure\\" kind of way). This album I can imagine being played by hundred's of our American cousins in their cars cruising down the freeway with this at volume as the tracks are all relatively car/radio-friendly. Fair to say, they don't really make albums that sound like this anymore. Whilst the SACD version does indeed breathe new life into the album's sound (if you are fortunate enough to have a SACD player) with extra headroom etc... I can't see the remastered version being that far behind in terms of sound quality. Either way, do give the album a try - if only so that you can hear Steve Perry's voice (how he managed to reach those high notes on Don't stop believin' suggests perhaps a \\"much too tight stretch-jeans\\" accident at some point!. If you like singing along you'll have a great time with this track - a great vocal!). Do be careful though - you may find yourself starting to mumble some of the melodies in company after a few plays; &/or provide funny but certain proof that most mere mortals just don't have that sort of vocal range!!
B00000I07P|5.0|I was sitting across the street from a neighbor's house while at my sister's, and I overheard them blasting that song. \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" was the song that opened my mind to listening to rock and roll stations. Thank God for Bon Jovi, and thank God for that moment of musical apprecation because before then, I wasn't much into rock. I mean, I would briefly check out the 80's channel on Satellite, but that was about it.<br /><br />At first, I didn't like this album that much. I couldn't wait 'til it was over. However, like other Rock albums, it grew on me. I don't care much about objectivity with regards to them now because I'm here to inspire others to take another step and get another CD, or hinder them from doing so.<br /><br />Hardcore rockers are \\"Let It Rock,\\" \\"You Give Love A Bad Name,\\" the track I began this review with, \\"Raise Your Hands,\\" \\"Social Disease,\\" and \\"Wild In The Streets.\\" The two love songs are \\"Without Love\\" and \\"I'd Die For You,\\" the lowest point of this album.<br /><br />If you don't bang your head while listening to this mostly hard record, then you won't enjoy it much. Appreciate the music. That's what I did.<br /><br />Also, there's a lyrical booklet featured. Enjoy!
B0041T7FS6|5.0|WOW!!  This collection is great.  Really gives you respect for these guys.  My favorite stuff, other than the music, is that they just left the intros and outros here.  You hear Tony count things off, studio chatter, and other goodies that make you think it's these guys just hanging out in the studio, playing together, and having a blast.  Also love the extended versions of songs like the stuff by Fonzi Thornton.  Hope we can hear more from him on future releases!!    The Dimitry from Paris stuff was ok.  Personally, I wish they would have used to space to dig a little deeper into the vault.    Most of this stuff has been released elsewhere.  As this seems to be an import-only set, you might want to check for certain songs on their Rhino compilation or other disco boxes.  If you're a true Chic fan though, go ahead and spring for it.  A great set and a great tribute to both Bernard and Tony!!
0446386898|2.0|Ordered this as a replacement. Searched everywhere for a particular version ad thought I found it. Unfortunately, it's the right issue but wrong cover art. :(  The picture shows exactly what I was looking for and I didn't get that.
B002OSUUPQ|5.0|This CD set is outstanding; I had heard it before on cassette and Ruiz' concepts were life-changing then, and this reminder again brought affirmative nods from me.  Peter Coyote remains one of my favorite narrators.
0805047905|5.0|When I first started reading this book to my daughter, I would read the first part \\"Brown bear, brown bear what do you see? I see a red bird looking at us\\". Then my daugther would \\"read\\" \\"Red bird, red bird, what do you see?\\" then I would read the next sentence and so on... It was fun because she was involved in the reading too. Now she just lifts the pages to see what's comes next, that way she can \\"read\\" the entire book by herself. She loves it!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The product came in a timely fashion and was in perfect, unused condition. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B00368Q3UY|4.0|I purchased this speaker MP3 player for my Grandson. He is happy with it so I am happy I bought it for him.
B004KPYQXI|2.0|Last year you could download amazon videos into your i tunes.  This year, they are making you download their own player, which is horrible.  The downloads take forever, the player doesn't work half the time, and it's one extra app on your machine you don't need.  My advice is wait for the dvd or download single eps from i tunes!
B0032JTV6U|4.0|It's ok
B001UN1KVE|5.0|Spaceballs!! It's Star Wars gone mad! If you have seen this movie, you really don't need a review - you already know that it is just a bunch of crazy fun! If you have not seen this movie, prepare to laugh out loud! I ordered this for my 15 year old son after being unable to find it in any stores locally (it's an older one!) He is a big Star Wars fan & both he & his friend were laughing throughout the entire movie. I had forgotten how silly & fun this movie is, until we all sat down last week with a bowl of popcorn & watched it together - fun, fun, fun!   The only \\"warning\\" I might add before purchasing or viewing this movie with younger children is the \\"G\\" rating. It really should be a \\"PG-13\\" as there are several instances of mature language (not overt) and one or two sexual references. Not as over the top as most movies nowadays, but you may want to preview the movie before sharing it with the youngsters.
0735619670|3.0|I bought this book because everyone was talking about it being such a great book.  I am halfway through the book and plan on reading it cover to cover.  Overall it is written well and I'm picking up some good points but the content is more than ready for revision 3.  Very little mention of .NET and code samples go back to classic C.  Alot of the studies quoted are from the seventies and eighties.  I suppose maybe I should have looked at the copyright before I bought because it is just getting a bit dated.
B00192IV9U|5.0|All the songs are great. Like to hear more soon. There's only one king of pop and that crown can never be replaced.
