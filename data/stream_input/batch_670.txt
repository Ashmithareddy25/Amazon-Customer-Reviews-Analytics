Most of the advice is commmon sense, I liked how he pointed out that a CEO mindset should be humility. Your job is to realize that there are smarter people than you, harness the power of those individuals to help you where you're taking your company. It was a fun read.

0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson has written his impressions of England as an American, and his impressions of the U.S. as a longtime British resident, and here he travels to the corners of Australia to chronicle his impressions as a wide-eyed outsider. Bryson is the kind of writer who has no ego. He makes fun of himself as quickly as he does everyone and everything else he finds absurd in this vast, sun-baked country-continent. His sense of humor varies from gentle to wicked, and he educates even as he jokes, sharing his wonder that there are such rare animals as monotremes, a species which gives birth through the same hole (the \\"cloaca\\") it uses for defecating. Coming upon an echidna, a monotreme, in the wild, he is, as he puts it, \\"thrilled right down to my cloaca.\\"     Pick up any Bryson book and you will find yourself laughing soon, and learning more than you thought you'd be interested in on any given subject. He makes facts and figures, usually about how fast our environment is being thoughtlessly ravaged by humans, so easy to swallow you don't even notice you have learned something. Bryson is one of a kind.    George Waters  [...]
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Casio Royale as a movie is 5 stars all the way. The pacing is fast. The action is raw and gadget-free. The whole texture of the film has artfully moved the Bond genre forward into a grittier vibe and is congruent with the trend to revisit the Cold-War Cool type of spy-dome. <br /> <br />BUT... this review is merely aimed at dampening your enthusiasm about the \\"90 minutes\\" worth of extras they tout in the 2-disc widescreen version. It's not \\"bad\\"... but it's not what I was anticipating. I had hoped to see some deleted scenes, maybe a few interesting outtakes and some real video from the set.  <br />What I got was a tightly scripted, controlled, fat-free, glossy, E-Entertainment, pre-packaged TV special about how great Daniel Craig is as the new James Bond and the vague process of figuring out who they were going to cast [BTW, they say several times that \\"Pierce Brosnan was too old\\" is why they didn't choose him. Sounded like sour grapes.] <br /> <br />The only other \\"extra\\" is a much more interesting, \\"behind the scenes\\" but again, highly polished, made-for-TV, sanitized mechanical effects piece. Besides that, all you get is the movie trailers. No outtakes, no deleted scenes, nothing really interesting that you couldn't get on TV or the internet. Don't bother paying extra for the Extras is all I'm advising.
038572179X|4.0|***WARNING : SPOILERS!***    Atonement is the first Ian McEwan book I've read, obtained at an end-of-year sale for ten bucks. But now I'm more than willing to pay 30-plus for his others (I heard Amsterdam and Saturday were world-class).    Atonement is about love torn asunder. The story is begins on the eve of WWII and revolves around 3 characters: robbie the son of a maid-servant who works for mr tallies (also his generous sponsor for his time at Cambridge University) whose daughter, Cecilia, Robbie is half-infatuated, half in love with. McEwan conveys perfectly the back-and-forth, I-love-her-I-love-her-not tensions in Robbie as he struggles with trying to say it to her 'officially'. Not unlike a salman rushdie, however, the 'truth' does come out via a quirky turn of events, leading to ultimate disaster. The calamity is wrought mainly by Briony, Cecilia's fantasy-filled idealistic younger sister who via a twist of coincidences, self-delusion, disappointment with the day's plans, somehow engineers the destructive reversal of Robbie's hopes (to put it mildly - and as the book's synopsis didn't in much detail what happened, I'll leave it out too; kinda like THAT knowing 'Spidey wins in the end' isn't enough, one has to find out HOW).    The above, all happening within a few hours, takes up a third of the book. And I half-thought it would be an all-in-one-day book.    But Atonement is also about war. The second-third has Robbie fighting both his inner demons (of unforgiveness towards the Tallis family) and running from the Nazis' and towards what any WWII buff would recognise as that miraculous sea evacuation on the coast of Dunkirk. This where McEvan's behind-the scenes portrayal of the build-up to Operation Dynamo merits brief comparison with Sebastian Faulks' vivid presentation of the Battle of the Somme in Birdsong.    We're transported to the beaches of Dunkirk where we witness the anguish of retreating men largely indifferent to the plight of the civilians and furious to the point of numbness at the non-existent support from the British airforce, waiting for a rescue which may not occur, fearing an end-all attack from the Nazis' which would meet far-below-par resistance from men desperate for water and medical care.    McEwan also brings to life the terror of the dive-bombing and strafing Stukas, like dragons swooping down on fleeing civilians and soldiers. Here we we'll find no high-tech technical-manual narrative a'la Tom Clancy, just sheer breath-taking suspense as the characters duck, run, take shelter, scream, lose hope, or are bombed to dust (where they stood transformed into an empty crater). I swear I heard the sound of the Stuka siren in my living room.    Probably due to my literary ignorance, I couldn't understand the point of certain scenes involving Robbie on the beach (his helping a woman and her pig, co-saving an RAF man about to be torn to bits by a mob of his fellow infantrymen, etc.). I doubt it was just to fill up the page quota. Was it to depict redemption during the hopeless minutae of war? Were we to being persuaded of Robbie's, and perhaps the British army's, inherently neighbour-loving nature? Maybe our feelings were being manipulated to achieve the, \\"Robbie, you're a really good person!\\" effect, a kind of prolonged characterisation process? Or was McEwan experimenting (with almost a third of the book) with a character who's had his life more or less ruined by a little girl but who yet manages extraordinary acts of kindness in the midst of war, albeit acts stained with thoughts of revenge, self-survival and hatred? Is there a 'key point' besides a prolonged process of characterisation which has almost no link between the first and last parts of the novel? I'm gonna need a tutorial here...    The book climaxes (don't think the word applies very much in 'serious fiction' anymore) with a transformed Briony, experiencing the most gruesome of war casualties and fatalities from her vantage point as traineenurse. The vividness in *this* section reminded me of the obligatory gore in many a war movie, only that reading about it has a granulatity and shock-value of its own. McEwan does a splendid job of giving us a virtually brand new Briony, so different (yet the same) from the girl we met in the first hundred pages. Trainee nurse Briony is a less confident, more authentic, more other-centered person - perhaps this depicts the process of atonement, which happens not at once but through a lifetime and brings the burden of doubt, failure, pain, sorrow as one wouldn't feel if one had no remorse over one's crimes against another.    Atonement, of course, must be about atonement i.e. a 'dealing with', covering, paying for and/or absorbing cum cleansing of sin, whether that of others or of one's self. To this end the novel explores, among other things, the creative forms which atonement can take, not least of which is fiction i.e. Cecilia and Robbie have been separated for good and have died tragically, so what better way for Briony to make amends by immortalising an alternative (and certainly more happy and fulfilling) account of their lives? This brings up questions about the institutional memory of those we don't know personally and how their biographies can be changed so - whatever the truth is - the world remembers them in a positive light and that - i.e. the memory - is what matters.    Oliver Stone's Alexander also played with this theme of fictionalising those whose lives (and deaths) we'd prefer others to remember fondly or proudly. In this movie, though, the 'truth' was presented first - that of Alexander dying from a mosquito bite whilst trying to conquer India - with the scribes changing the story later. The key issues here would be the validity and value of fantasy's role in not only masquerading as history, but in performing atonement (of whatever kind).    Given how history has often (if not always) been written to preserve and sustain vested interests and power, perhaps Briony's act may be seen as redemptive and subversive, opening the doors to future fictional re-writings which at least have altruistic and other-centered purposes in mind (cf. Foucault's deliberate 'distorting' of history to make a point). Re-writing the past may be more than a childish imaginary act; it could be an act of imagination that aims at a transformation of the present, the counter-part of the many direct lies told by insidious parties.    If the power of the memory of Cecilia and Robbie's relationship can be compared to the actual relationship, then perhaps the tragedy of the latter can be swallowed up in the triumph of the former. This kind of atonement, therefore, seeks not to stop at atonement, but pushes all the way towards a sort of redemption, too.    Were sins, then, really atoned for? Briony/McEwan doesn't give a definitive answer, except to suggest that writing may be a form of atonement - or not. And thus Atonement is also about literature and the limitations upon the writer in relation to word-acts towards the other. Perhaps the question asked all along is, \\"What can writing do to life?\\" In the face of death, sins and stukas, is a story, no matter how good, of any value?    From a literary perspectives, of course, I'm assuming the 'reality' of all that Briony wrote other than the parts she said she made up. Of course, the wonder of McEwan's (as opposed to merely Briony's) novel is that this can hardly be taken for granted.    If Briony made the final portion up, then maybe she made up some critical parts of the earlier sections i.e. it's impossible to delineate some acceptable level of fantastical 'contamination'. And besides, how could Briony know about some of the private conversations between Cecilia and Robbie? More importantly, what else could Briony have missed from the start and how much of it has been re-written or re-imagined or re-imagined yet believed to be true? And therefore doesn't this render the very nature of the 'facts' being presented suspect in its very constitution? Since everything was from Briony's point-of-view from the very beginning, are we even entitled to ask the question of what 'really happened'?    Standing back even further, what about life, history, the world and reality themselves? Who tells these stories? Why do we believe the truths we believe? And - just like how realising that one of the characters was telling the story from the start - would our understanding of our world change with the recognition that it's we ourselves doing the story-telling? And if not us, then who?    A sure improvement over Faulks' Birdsong (which is also about love, war, redemption, etc.), this book is surprisingly easy to follow, though without any shortage of literary brilliance (there's a great section in which a publisher gives feedback to Briony about a book she submitted which had some superb hints for would-be writers[!], plus many of Briony's ruminations and corrections on her plays and writing).     In these days of work fatigue and reduced leisure time, people like me crave for easy-going, profound, dramatic and insightful novels. Atonement sure does satisfy.
0618680004|5.0|The drumbeat of reason was like a clarion call to me. I feel awake, alert, after reading this book. It's like being let in on a conversation that I was not privy to hear for many, many years - the other side of the argument. It was then I realized just how much the religious leaders of my childhood tried to poison the well and seal off young minds from questioning, and reason. The dark well of ignorance that I crawled out of was startlingly dark! <br /> <br />As a spiritual person (not religious though), I was a little skeptical at first. How does he know, with certainty, that God does not exist? But I was curious what drew him to that conclusion so I read the book. His arguments were logical, yet not in-your-face about it. He goes step-by-step into detail about how all the living things on earth came to be, without the hand of a \\"designer\\", and dismisses myths commonly used to try to discredit the scientifically sound evolution. The second half of the book is about the danger and threat to society of fundamentalist minds. The holy book is rife with instructions (and encouragement) for genocide, homocide, racism, violence and oppression against women and other horrible crimes, told to children as fairy tales. Those sorts of things may have been acceptable in the 1st century, but it isn't now! The fact that there are people out there who are trying to renact 1st century standards of morality makes me more vigilant about the separation of church and state than ever. The survival of our civilizations depend on reasonable people speaking out and organizing against fundamentalism.  <br /> <br />Read it and be awake.

B000000WJZ|5.0|Those who often wonder why the Smashing Pumpkins were so highly regarded back in the day need look no further than their second effort, 1993's \\"Siamese Dream.\\" Not only did it prove to be a commercial breakthrough for the band, but it was also breaking new ground musically  and set a standard for many bands to follow onward. While [[ASIN:B000000W6F Gish]] got the band started on the right foot, this is truly the album where the Pumpkins' signature wall of sound was created, paving the way for the many experiments the band would exercise in it's troubled future.<br /><br />Sure, you coud attribute this album's greatness to a lot of smoke and mirrors, due to the studio wizardy of Butch Vig, who creates an orchestra of guitars on many of the album's meatiest songs. But even at the core, the songs are still strong on their own. Whether \\"Siamese Dream\\" was recorded by layering electric guitar over electric guitar or simply put to tape on an acoustic guitar, the end result would have been equally as effective. In between massive rock songs like \\"Cherub Rock\\" and \\"Geek U.S.A.\\" are the more tamer, lyric-driven \\"Mayonaise\\" and \\"Soma\\" which stand as proof that the Pumpkins can still keep it together stripped down. \\"Today,\\" the album's biggest hit, is a perfect testament to Corgan's gift of crafting the perfect song, with it's infectious pop chorus driven by heavy guitars and seemingly sunny subject matter. Elsewhere, on the ironically titled \\"Quiet,\\" Corgan digs into some old school Sabbath riffing, with it's guitars tuned lower than low, creating a signature sound. One thing that Smashing Pumpkins never got credit for is the riffs they created, and \\"Siamese Dream\\" is chock full of some of the best of the 90's.<br /><br />Front to back, \\"Siamese Dream\\" is the kind of album you will keep coming back to, years and years after your first listen. Even fourteen years later, it's still an impressive piece of music that stands alone in it's genre. If the rumors are believed to be true, and Billy really did record all the strings himself, then he deserves a massive chunk of credit for crafting a perfect record which still sounds fresh today. Since the Smashing Pumpkins have reunited without reuniting, perhaps we don't have to worry about Billy messing things up. Regardless, \\"Siamese Dream\\" remains a cornerstone of any rock collection. Since it's not as dense as the sprawling [[ASIN:B000000WA4 Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]] or as edgy and experimental as the latter day albums, it's definitely THE album for new fans to discover the Pumpkins.eally did record all the strings himself, then he deserves a massive chunk of credit for crafting a perfect record which still sounds fresh today.

1932100660|5.0|How nice to see a well-organized and well-written book that is not another FAD diet or program.  I have never read a book with so many references to research studies and articles.  I work at a large university and can't wait to access some of the referenced articles to read even more detail.  A lot of this information was new to me although I read a great deal on diet and nutrition. My family gave up milk years ago when we saw the research linking casein to Autism and ADHD. So seeing the research on calcium, the true causes of osteoporosis, and the negatives of dairy were not a shock, but just affirmation of what I have seen elsewhere.   <br />Dr. Campbell does an excellent job of putting his research and that of others in easy to understand terms along with adding examples.  I almost put the book down when I saw that he promotes a vegetarian lifestyle.  Let me tell you, I am so glad I went against my initial instinct to avoid hearing negative information about diets high in animal products and read the book anyway.  I would encourage anyone to read this book with an open mind.  You will be in awe as you read...I couldn't put it down and actually read it while on a cruise last week in the Bahama's.  Sure did make that fresh fruit on the ship look even better!  Seriously, this is a must read.  I also recommend books by Dr. Colbert if you are interested in healing through nutrition or detoxification.

B000N6TX1S|1.0|Hippies save the world from \\"evil fascists\\" (TM).  Nothing further needs to be said.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|\\"Resident Evil\\" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparant deaths of hundreds of employees;  at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandoes.  Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the \\"Resident Evil\\" series of video games. <br /> <br />   With \\"Resident Evil\\", it was far from a given that it could make such a good transition into a movie, to me at least.  It's not like \\"Silent Hill\\" (which has also generated an excellent movie) or \\"Fatal Frame\\" (which I'm still waiting for the movie version of), both of which had lots of identifiable movie potential from the beginning.  The \\"Resident Evil\\" games are a bit different, almost nonstop action, most of them not as developed along character or story purposes (these aspects have begun growing in some of the more recent Resident games).  They needed to fill in some areas for the movie to be as good as the games.  Most of the games pit S.T.A.R. (a highly trained law enforcement organization) agents against hordes of ravenous zombies, occasionally teaming the S.T.A.R. agents with other characters.  It's made a lot of great games, but could it move into just as great a movie?  One thing they did was split the focus up among more characters of different backgrounds - you've got the S.T.A.R. team, you've got the amnesiac Alice - whose nature is kept a mystery until near the movie's end) - as a main point-of-view character, there are the Umbrella (the name of the corporation that owns the underground facility) people and you've got another major character coming into it from outside the main 'groups'.  (This trend of character diversifaction has continued with the \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" sequel, and some of the more recent entries to the game line)  It takes longer to build into where the zombie carnage really starts flying, which is fitting for the first entry of a movie series. It introduces the elements at a pace that's equally good for longtime fans of the games and books as well as for viewers who've never even heard of the concept.  All in all, the transition was more successful than I thought it could be - this is a great, hi-octane horror-action movie which succeeds in establishing good characters and a great 'edge-of-catacylsm' air.  The ending flows directly into \\"Apocalypse\\"; and a third \\"Resident Evil\\" movie is coming in Fall 2007. <br /> <br />  Great beginning to what's shaping up to be a great, and long-running, horror saga.

B00005JNEW|4.0|I have read so many spectacular reviews of the TV series FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHT that I decided that I needed to watch the series myself.  But I first wanted to see the film that the TV series was based upon.<br /><br />This is a carefully crafted film about the somewhat dubious role that football is allowed to play in the lives of small town Americans.  What many people seem to miss in seeing the film is the deeply critical aspects of the film.  While the struggles of Permian High School to overcome the loss of their star player Boobie Miles -- who is portrayed as a 1988 high school equivalent of today's Darren McFadden of Arkansas (like McFadden, Miles is portrayed as someone who is spectacularly fast, a great receiver, and even an accomplished passer) -- take center stage, there is also a quiet but pervasive criticism of the role that football is allowed to play in people's lives in this small town.  There is the sadness of several former players who have never been able to find meaning in their lives after hanging up their cleats.  There is also the poignancy of people utterly obsessed with the failure or success of the local high school team, as if there was some connection between the quality of their lives and the fate of the team.  From the beginning to the end of the movie there is a sense that these are people without lives, so that while on one level we celebrate the victories of the team on another we experience a deep sadness.  I kept thinking of something Kierkegaard wrote while watching the movie.  He distinguished between the comic and the tragic, characterizing the latter as regarding with finite interest that which ought to be of eternal interest, while identifying the comic as regarding something finite as of eternal interest.  In this sense, the movie is at its heart a tragicomedy.  The movie doesn't explore precisely why these people have such sad lives, but it leaves no question at the end that they do.<br /><br />This is a very slick movie, which is impressive given that it was essentially a low budget film (it was made for around $30 million) with a very large cast.  As a result the film has pretty much a no name cast, the only actor that most people would be familiar with being Billy Bob Thornton.  But the film never reveals its low budget.  From beginning to end every aspect is highly polished.<br /><br />I mentioned the way that the movie criticizes our obsession with football and how this obsession is contrasted with the fundamental emptiness in the lives of the characters in the film.  The two characters who most display these aspects of the film are the aforementioned Boobie Miles and former star Charles Billingsley, played by country music star Tim McGraw.  The only thing that Miles has going for him at the start of the film is his athletic ability and as we hear him struggling to read a recruiting letter we realize that he is borderline illiterate.  When he learns that his knee injury is far worse than anyone imagined he realizes how little life has to offer him.  He is a man with rapidly collapsing horizons.  Billingsley, on the other hand, has only his memories of having starred for Permian.  He relentlessly drives his son to achieve a similar kind of success so that he can relive some of it vicariously.<br /><br />This film in the end is not a celebration of football, but a paean on our excessive obsession with what is, in the end, only a game.  It does not mean that football is devoid of all redeeming values, but it does mean to point out that there is more to life than football.hich is impressive given that it was essentially a low budget film (it was made for around $30 million) with a very large cast.

It does not mean that football is devoid of all redeeming values, but it does mean to point out that there is more to life than football.

B000H0MKGK|4.0|I LOVE John Mayer and the soulful diversity of his music. If you love Continuum, you have to get Try because John Mayer live is soooooooooooooo FANTASTIC on and Try proves how dynamic he really is!
B000NA77YO|5.0|Just to start off,I am a big fan of Dio,as a solo artist.More familiar with Ozzman as the leader of Sabbath,but do like Dio's stuff with Sabbath. Don't have any Sabbath with Dio,besides this album,I just purchased.But that will change,now. Pretty much,only familiar with \\"Neon Knights\\",\\"Heaven & Hell,\\"The Mob Rules\\",\\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" & \\"Children of The Sea\\".But after listening to the new and old tracks,I never heard,am a new,big fan of Dio's Sabbath days. \\"Ear In The Wall\\" is my fave new song.The other's are cool.So,if you are a Sabbath,Dio,Rainbow(w/ Dio,of course) fan,I would suggest picking this one up.I am a fan of slow stuff and fast,so it pleases me.\\"Mob rules\\",will probably start my collection of Dio's Sabbath stuff.<br /><br />D I O !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000GRUS22|5.0|Most detractors here seem to lament that there's nothing new in A Posteriori. The assumption being that the lack of novelty in and of itself is reason enough and reason alone to dislike an album. Heck, that may well be the very reason I even consider buying a composer's works -- because I want more of what I like! If you're after something rip-roaringly unusual, pulsating cuts such as \\"Feel Me Heaven\\" may highlight why Michael Cretu is known for his vision in music; the sounds are wild, unprecedented. This is clearly a softer, slower, more sublime compilation than, say, Return to Innocence, but Enigma has rather ably weaved together, yet again, the spiritual and the carnal, the ambient and the vocal. I am not sure why many listeners seem to echo the theme of \\"night music\\", perhaps because \\"A Posteriori\\" means \\"What comes after\\"? Or maybe because the sounds would make for an excellent background to a relaxed drive in the night. There aren't a lot of vocals for you to worry about, as your Latin and French are probably as rusty as mine--these could be prayers or amorous songs of devotion. Use your imagination. But if you have ever enjoyed Enigma's trademark music, grab a copy of this. It makes for an excellent accompaniment to, um, several things of beauty.

B00005JPMC|2.0|All these stars of recommendation -- are you kidding me! For a movie that starts with so much promise, this sure turns into Bollywood in about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Danny Glover sports a lisp. The plot sports a brain malfunction. Politicians are easily located and live in houses that are sorely under-guarded, their meager protection coming from patently inept soldiers who cannot shoot straight, ever. The music and direction are painfully juvenile, such as a heavy metal backdrop with drums and cymbals when our oh-so-cool protagonist, suitably named Bob Lee Swagger, drops a clever line and swaggers away in slow motion with his shades on.<br /><br />This protagonist and his whiz partner (suitably Hispanic, to cater to a global audience, because the African American crowd was already covered with the villain, and the Chinese/oriental with an FBI agent) go on to jointly defeat an army of about a hundred soldiers who're heavily armed with machine guns and everything else. The massacre takes place around a house, completely surrounded, but not to worry. Our hero has some real killer stuff that he and his pot-bellied aide have pulled together from groceries from the local supermarket, such as salt, sugar, and straw. There was also a plier, which should have greatly helped.<br /><br />Then there's the scene on the top of a rather high snow-capped mountain where snipers are conveniently located and camouflaged in white fur, waiting for a certain helicopter to arrive before they start shooting each other. How did they get there in the first place? Perhaps they were serious rock climbers and spent two days to get to the peak, or of course, they could have been escorted in a cable car. Failing that, if the only plausible alternative was to take a helicopter or some other aerial route, how was it that they did not spot each other earlier?<br /><br />Action trumps logic here.  The villains are cardboard evil, never really striking any meaningful chord of fear. Wahlberg, who was stunning in The Departed and still manages to contribute the screen presence in this farce, really ought to reconsider doing these B-grade movies before he becomes the new Van Damme. The exploding bombs and energetic car chases may appeal to a couple of freckled teenagers, but overall it's a predictable mess of a film.tunning in The Departed and still manages to contribute the screen presence in this farce, really ought to reconsider doing these B-grade movies before he becomes the new Van Damme.

1881273156|5.0|I knew the five languages before I read the book, thanks to many references from various venues.  Therefore, I didn't exactly rush to actually read it.  However, now that I've read it, I wish I hadn't waited so long to do so! <br /> <br />The book begins by opening your eyes to the need for understanding people's love languages.  It does this partially by explaining the difference between the \\"in love experience\\" and actually loving someone.  It also explains that there are various dialects to each love language, which keeps them from being really restrictive, boxed in, and cookie-cutter-ish.   <br /> <br />Chapman doesn't pretend this book is all you need to navigate relationships successfully; instead, he suggests you apply what you learn from it to what you absorb from other books, articles, and seminars.  It can make other information out there on marriage and relationships even more helpful.  While the book can be helpful for dealing with all types of relationships, it is primarily addressed to married couples (hence the \\"How to Express Heartfelt Committment to Your Mate\\" part of the title).  However, one of the later chapters addresses parents. <br /> <br />Chapters 4-8 describe the five love languages - words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch - in detail with stories to help illustrate them.  While the love languages seem fairly self-explanatory, you might not understand them properly until actually reading the book.  This was the case for me.  I thought acts of service was close to the bottom on my list of love languages only to discover that it's actually a co-primary love language for me.  I won't attempt to summarize the languages for you; I don't want to spoil the read! :) <br /> <br />After explaining the love languages, Chapman helps you assess your primary language by pointing out various indicators.  He then explains how love is a choice not a feeling by revisiting the concept of the \\"in love experience\\" vs. loving someone.  The book gives you hope through a few success stories mixed all about; but most importantly, the book is realistic.  There is a chapter called Loving the Unlovely that addresses the fact that not everyone's mate will be open to learning and growing.  While the chapter does list yet another success story, it clearly states twice that there are no guarantees that your mate will respond positively to your attempts to speak his/her love language. <br /> <br />At the end of the book there is a quiz for him and a quiz for her to assess your love languages.  Personally, I felt the quiz was poorly constructed.  My personal recommendation would be to take the quiz with your ideal in mind.  For instance, if one of the statements says, \\"I know that my husband/wife loves me because he/she surprises me with gifts,\\" I would read it as, \\"I WOULD know that my husband/wife loves me IF...\\"  I think your results will be more accurate this way as they will not be impacted by what your mate actually does or doesn't do. <br /> <br />The real value in this book is that it not only helps you and your mate understand and assess your love languages, but it gives you some specific ways you can develop ones that are not primary or natural to you (yay, application)!  The whole \\"love tank\\" illustration was a little cheesy for my taste, but I suppose it is a clear and simple way to help you visualize the amount of love others are actually feeling from you, regardless of how much you're giving in your own way.  Overall the book is a well-written, easy read that is both helpful and hopeful.  I highly recommend reading it today!
0399224459|5.0|Three kids after we first received this book, we now give it out as a standard \\"new parent\\" gift basket.  With no words, this book is all about the wonderful pictures and the parent's ability to make up the story to go along with the images.  It allows for a personal connection to the story.  As the kids get older, they can also move past the main theme of the images and look for little consistencies like spotting the rising balloon or the stuffed toys in each animal's cage.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|at first i thought maybe this movie would not be as good as the other five, but after seeing it i should have realized it was going to be just as great, i am not ashamed to say that i cried through the entire movie, rocky and adrienna are one of those couples that should never be apart. the reason i gave it 4 stars is, because i did not like the idea of the young lady being friends with rocky. but all in all i would recommend others to watch this movie, especially if you have been a fan of the other rocky movies.
B000063JDE|2.0|I loved Mulholland Drive so next on the \\"Lynch\\" list for me was Blue Velvet. It started off with some interesting things happening but just sort of spun its wheels and rather abruptly ended with a pretty standard, pre-canned movie ending that took some steam out of it so to speak. <br /> <br />The acting was OK. Laura Dern looks damned young here...and, well, she was young here.  The problem is that her acting wasnt very polished. She has grown leaps and bounds since this so thats good.  Kyle McLauchlin was decent but he didnt have any or portray any of that small-town goodness which he needed to show more of to be more believable and to add a sense of \\"wow\\" to this whole caper. Dennis Hopper was his usual obnoxious self.  He had some funny moments but became rather annoying towards the end as his crazy guy \\"act\\" was becoming tiresome.  Isabella Rosellini is pretty hot and does a great job with a very tough role so hats off to her. She was easily the best character in the movie. <br /> <br />The plot grabbed me from the beginning but nothing really came of it. It just sort of built itself up and then dissolved into the same old stuff without much fanfare. I was expecting some more interesting twists (like Mulholland Drive) or at least a little deeper plot arc.  It never came though and before I knew it it was over and that was that. Nothing really notable or revealing here, just a pretty basic movie. I get the whole \\"Even in small-town USA there are crazy thing going on\\" message but to be honest, maybe the film doesnt age well since nothing I saw was even that amazingly bad or disturbing. The \\"rape\\" scene had its \\"ohhhhh\\" moments but even that had some tongue-in-cheek(meant to be silly) antics which killed the \\"horror\\" of it or the \\"disturbing\\" nature of it. <br /> <br />Go ahead and try it out but I was rather underwhelmed by this effort and after the mind-blowing Mulholland Drive, this was mostly a let-down. <br /> <br />Only Recommended as a rental...
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I bought this CD despite the fact that an \\"actor\\" is the creative mind behind the music.  I was surprised.  It is a solid rock album.  Jared Leto wrote the lyrics/music and plays guitar.  And he's actually good.  Wow.  What a concept.  I half expected to hear something similiar to that produced by the vomit-inducing crappola artists that Disney is spewing out in mass (Lohan, Duff, etc., etc., etc.)  But not so.  Deliver me from the endless onslaught of pop tartlets and sappy male pop bands (what's with all the male singers with high-pitched girly voices?)  This CD is a relief from all that.  Leto's vocals growl and soar.  I am not a Jared Leto fan (trust me) but I do admire his passion for his craft, which is obviously music.  This CD from 30 Seconds to Mars convinced me that there are still bands who have rock and roll coursing through their veins...bands who aren't afraid to bleed rock and roll.  Loves it.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|I'm a big Will Smith fan and love feel good movies so was very excited about this one but this one bored me almost to tears.

1878424114|5.0|A few years back I had a heart attack.  When I asked the doctor what the most effective things I could do to live a prolonged and happy life in the future, he recommended three things:  Eat right, Exercise, and Learn to manage stress.<br /><br />While eating right and exercising are merely choices that one either decides to do or not, learning to manage stress is much more difficult.  That's where The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success came to the fore-front.  I have found the Laws to be on target and an immense help in both learning to manage stress as well as in enjoying life to the fullest.<br /><br />As a side note, I am a born again Christian. While my beliefs deviate from Deepak's in a couple of areas, for the most part, I found these Laws to be pretty consistent with the teachings of Christ... particularly as laid out in the 'Sermon on the Mount' found in Matthew 5 thru 7.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men begins with the death of the youngest person on the planet, baby Diego, who was 18 years old. Not a single child has been born since. This massive sterility has flung the world into paranoia and finally war. In the first minute you'll see a montage of all the world's great cities, all either bombed or in social disorder. While this tumult isn't explained, it does seem justified, especially if you stop and imagine a world where no babies had been born in twenty years...the infertility would reach beyond a woman's womb, that's for sure. Britain is the only place left on the planet that isn't in a terrible state of anarchy, yet offers state sponsored suicide pills.  <br /> <br />Because it is the sole center of relative peace in worldly chaos refugees (or fugees) flock to Britain, but find themselves not allowed and put into encampments where they face incredible brutalities and occasional violent purges. <br /> <br />Clive Owen plays an ex political radical who is drawn by his ex-wife, a member of an terrorist group trying to get the government to recognize the refugees, back into the struggle. He has to Shepard a young and very special woman to the coast so that she can presumably save the world. <br /> <br />The movie doesn't really stop. It is always moving, stringing one elaborate chase sequence after another. Some of these sequences are mind-blowing, without pause, and leave you wondering how they could've possibly pulled them off. I saw this movie in a packed theater and in the moments of silence not a person whispered. I found my legs getting tingly and dead because I wasn't breathing enough. <br /> <br />I will say quite seriously that this movie has the highest stakes of any I've ever seen. They are both universal and deeply personal. While I wouldn't disagree that this movie is political, calling it \\"liberal propaganda\\" would require a fair amount of projection. For the sake of not ruining the movie I won't be specific, but the liberals in this are NOT the good guys, nor is the conservative and fascist regime. <br /> <br />This is one of the most socially relevant movies in years. Children of Men explores a society on the verge of breaking, where promise and hope have completely decayed. The world of Children of Men is built on means but without an end, and if this doesn't sound familiar I'd say you should clean your ears and open your eyes. This film certainly isn't conventional. You'll find no sweeping romance, no blatant slap your face redemption, there is no patriotism (for anything aside from humanity), and it doesn't end in a field of tulips or worldwide peace. You won't be left with all your questions answered so you can go to sleep as you did the night before. This movie might give you a little indigestion, but working through those cramps is a good thing. <br /> <br />Though this movie is in many ways punishing on the senses it does go easy on you sometimes. Michael Caine provides excellent comic relief as a burnt out intellectual who took refuge deep in the woods. Cilve Owen of course shines, playing a depressed drunk extremely well. Julianne Moore's role is small, but well played and the cast of characters that come and go in this movie run a beautiful spectrum of humanity; from the profane to the profound. <br /> <br />The presentation of the future is incredibly tasteful. You'll find no floating cars, hover boards, or holographic scanning devices. This isn't Total Recall. Everything is subtle and struck me as very plausible. <br /> <br />The music is very well used, FOR ONCE, particularly the Penderecky at the end, which made that final sequence unbearably tense, making you fight with the chair you're sitting in. <br /> <br />Alfonso Cuaron is a very talented director and I look forward to his next project (as I did for this one; I've been a fan since Y Tu Mama Tambien). He has really done the impossible. A hopefully movie set in the most hopeless world imaginable. This isn't your usual sci-fi picture with aliens coming to wipe out a multitude of faceless people you really don't care about. It attacks at the heart of things and will certainly have you thinking for days. <br /> <br />ONE FINAL NOTE: <br /> <br />This movie is tied with Blade Runner as my favorite science fiction film of all time. If that isn't a good recommendation, I really don't know what is.
068987474X|4.0|This book is for every woman in a relationship with a man. Read the chapters: does he pass the test for being into you, or is the book right on about some of his irritating behaviors? Well then, dump the MF (I'm a fan of Dan Savage, too). You deserve better. (I'd give this 5 stars, but the writing is repetitive and a bit lacking in places. Still, very worth reading.)
074356619X|4.0|These cds I found even better than the dvd of the Secret, they are full of practical ideas and examples and specific problems to overcome. I would recommend them to anyone who wishes to be able to focus and change aspects of their life. Money well spent.
0618680004|2.0|This  is an interesting and thought provoking book. Although written with a very strong prejudice against religion in general and Christianity in particular, it nevertheless raises some valid and challenging questions. It would be good for Christians to read the book carefully and thoughtfully before rubbishing it as complete nonsense. Certainly there are times when Professor Dawkins' anger surfaces and objectivity is sacrificed and he opens himself up to well deserved criticism. In any case there are quite a number of objections and counter arguments that can be brought against Dawkins' book and opponents of Dawkins would do well to think through some of the issues raised and give a reasoned response to them.  <br /> <br />There are two major premises that this book is based on. <br /> <br />1. That the complexity of the life is such that it could not possibly have come about by chance (here he agrees with creationists) but that \\"natural selection\\" not intelligent design accounts for this. <br /> <br />2. That because we live in a physical universe, reality exists only in that physical universe.  He therefore discounts any real \\"spirit\\" world. Prayer, angels, demons and God are therefore nothing more than products of the human mind - hence the title of his book. <br /> <br />To take the first premise, it is a pity that Professor Dawkins does not deal with this in any detail - perhaps he feels he has done this in his other books. In this book however he deals with the question of intelligent design in a rather superficial manner without getting down to some really basic issues. In the end he dismisses ID by simply saying that if you accept it you then have an even greater problem in explaining the origin and complexity of the designer. This is true but it is certainly no proof against ID. This is a very feeble argument and one is left wondering why an intelligent man should resort to it. Let us accept for argument's sake the concept of evolution by natural selection, we still need to go back a step further and ask how does this work in practice. The answer is found in the encoding of the DNA in a living cell. Here we find a program for the immensely complex structure of the human body with its trillions of cells and its 200 different tissue types. How did this program, which in the words of Dr Francis Crick the co-discoverer of DNA, is equivalent to 4000 books with 500 pages each, come into existence? Even Richard Dawkins at one time stated, \\"it is uncannily like a computer!\\" Has anybody ever heard of a computer that was not intelligently designed? Surely the real question here is not \\"how?\\" but \\"who?\\" programmed the living cell?   <br /> <br />Dr. Crick  quotes Salvador Dali as saying, \\"For me this is the real proof of the existence of God.\\"  Why did Dr. Crick hide behind somebody else's words I wonder. Contrary to what Professor Dawkins claims there are a growing number of eminent scientists who have expressed similar sentiments. <br /> <br />Let's take the second premise.  The last dozen pages of Richard Dawkins book were for me excellent. Here he briefly touched on quantum mechanics and explained how as humans we see through such a narrow window as we look on our world and universe. There was a time not so long ago when we had no idea of the reality of radio waves and gamma rays but now we have the means to \\"see\\" and understand things previously unknown. The strange thing to me is that these last pages seemed to go completely against the title of this book and showed that there could be realities including a \\"spirit\\" world which may not as yet be identified by scientific instruments. Indeed there are millions of people throughout the world who insist that they are in touch with this world, and have come to know the reality of \\"God\\" through Jesus Christ. The \\"faith\\" that so many dismiss as blind belief against reason, may actually be as the Bible puts it, \\" the substance of things hoped for, the EVIDENCE of things not seen.\\" (Hebrews 11 v. 1) Think about it! <br /> <br />Regarding Dawkins' claims that science has rendered religion obsolete, consider the following words of Max Planck, founder of quantum theory, spoken during his Nobel Prize acceptance speech: \\"As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear-headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research into atoms this much. There is no matter, as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of the atom to vibration. I must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter\\" <br /> <br />In addition to these scientific facts, we are told that the universe is incredibly finely tuned in order to exist at all.  Tuned in fact to the degree of one part in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion.  Anyone who believes that that is the product of chance and not intelligent design has the most incredible, blind, unreasoning faith !!  100 years ago most scientists believed the universe was eternal, or in other words that it had always existed. Nowadays scientists know that the universe had a definite beginning. The opening words of the Bible are, \\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\\" (Genesis 1 v.1) Blind faith or scientific fact? <br /> <br />It is a pity that Professor Dawkins has such a poor understanding of the Bible and Christian theology. Ironically he accuses Christians of \\"cherry picking\\" texts of the Bible, but that is exactly what he does himself. Even worse is that he makes no attempt to investigate either the historical or cultural background and ends up with an incredibly gross distortion of the nature and character of the loving, gracious, patient, just and holy God of the Bible.   <br /> <br />Read this book by all means.  Richard Dawkins must surely know it is very one sided, but of course he is very much entitled to his opinion and can express itas he sees appropriate. For those who would like to see the other side I would suggest the following books all obtainable from Amazon and all written by scientists. <br />The Naked Emperor (Anthony Latham); Evolution under the Microscope (David Swift);  Dawkins' God (Alistair McGrath) For those of an atheistic persuasion, test your open-mindedness by looking at both sides !

If you love great comedy films, buy this one now!!!!
0670038040|3.0|Sir John Mortimer is a source of wonder to me. Despite declining health, he still manages to put pen to paper, fingers to keyboard and compose new work. The latest installment of the \\"Rumpole\\" series is serviceable effort but has the feeling of a \\"paint by numbers\\" approach.  Mortimer knows Horace Rumpole so intimately that he can almost channel him (no doubt employing the ghost  of the inimitable Leo McKern to facilitate his efforts). Mortimer has long been a champion of civil rights, an outspoken  defender of the golden rule of jurisprudence, that the accused is innocent until found guilty by a jury of his/her peers.  Sir John's dismay at the increased police powers contained in Britain's onerous anti-terror legislation registers on every page and redeems and ennobles a lesser effort in a worthy, long-running series.
B000NA28I4|2.0|This movie was entertaining and well produced.  Acting, production, cinematography, costume, story - all better than average. Thats were the good stuff ends.  No suspense. Bad character development.  Poor plot development. Rush Rush Rush.  Everything happens too fast.  If done slightly different this movie could have possibly been the next Star Wars. Or at least a highly popular franchise.  I just do not understand what the thinking is behind the trend to make movies like video games.  Do the producers really believe the general viewing public is that brain dead?  I will not tell you what happens in the end. There is a scene that happens in a period of 5 seconds. Yes 5 seconds. Very important scene. I was glad I had the dvd so I could back up and see it again.  If you were in the move theater and reached over to grab your drink you would have missed it. <br />The only thing the movie did for me was kindle my desire to read the book.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|a classic.. nice to hear the kids sing these classic tunes watching it!!!
0441172717|4.0|I love the concept of this book, and the story is out of sight, it's that great.  However, I can't give this 5 stars.  First it's because of the unpronouncable names and various other proper nouns.  I wouldn't complain if it was only a smattering of hard to read words.  But in this cast of thousands, its impossible to go more than 20 pages without a new person place or thing called something close to jibberish.  And I read mostly sci-fi and fantasy novels, so I am used to a strange name here and there, but this book is chock full of them, maddeningly so.  Second, the amazing political machinations are enough to make a reader have to create a flow-chart in order to keep up.  I don't mind political intrigue, I like it.  But Lordy!  Everyone has an agenda, everyone plots behind the scences, it's incredibly complex.  I'm not that fond of the super-complicated plot lines.  Those are my complaints, and these two thing make it difficult to read.  But read it I did, and I do say the images are great, a reader can visualize everything clearly and accurately and the story is great.  Shakespeare would be awed.  Read it, but take notes.
B00000420F|4.0|I feel like recommending this compilation to people wanting to listen to some old arias to learn if they like this genre and to singing students as well:<br /><br />Ms Bartoli's voice is not particularly beautiful, but her technique is quite good especially on record. Here and there her voice gets harsh, flat, losing brilliance and warmth, but most of the time one can concentrate on the accurate rendering of these old and beautiful arias.<br /><br />She wisely decided to follow the letter of Parisotti's score, therefore meeting the need of all singing students of having a reference for their study. The agility is outstanding but pronunciation and expression, as well as the perfect gusto in presenting the phrases, are what make this compilation worthwhile. Not a word goes wasted or neglected but her being Italian and her sensitivity manage to avoid overkill.<br /><br />One could wish she would publish compilations of single authors of the xvi and xvii centuries, edited according to philological criteria or else other compilations of the dated but still useful Parisotti edition.
B00005LC1H|5.0|As a teenager back in the late 80s early 90s, my parents had at some time bought some vhs tapes of some of the Faulty Towers series. We used to watch them over and over again. Finally, I noticed they had come out with a complete season series on dvd. My wife and I purchased it as soon as we found out they were available on dvd. As my wife had never watched, let alone heard of this show, weve had many hours of intense laughter on the couch together watching Basil and crew mess up everything over and over again.
B00005JPLU|4.0|Finally saw it last night after anxiously awaiting its arrival for well over a year and I came away from the film being somewhat impressed by certain features of the film, but by no means is this one of the greatest films ever made since it leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />Acting wise '300' works, if only slightly above average. The cast is actually well chosen in terms of having the right look as the men are very muscular, much in the same way one imagines the Spartans were. The women were the classic beauties but felt like not much more than window dressing, except for the queen, King Leonidas' wife. She's the only one who had any kind of meaningful presence in the story. Sadly, despite the acting chops of everyone involved, they were limited by the cookie cutter dialogue. The dialogue wasn't stilted, but nevertheless it wasn't something that hadn't been seen a thousand times before and for that it left a gap by those wishing to gain a little more insight into these brave characters.<br /><br />One thing that kind of puzzles me is that with the precedent set by Gibson in 'The Passion of the Christ' in which the actors speak Aramaic and Latin, and in his latest 'Apocolypto' the actors speak Mayan, so why not have Greek actors speak their native tongue? Or at the very least incorporate some Greek phrases or words into the dialogue, that would've added to the feel of their culture.  Of course this missing feature does not detract from the film's value but it would certainly have been a substantial contribution to the essence of the film.<br /><br />Aesthetically speaking, the movie is a masterpiece. Many of the scenes were quite breathtaking and looked incredibly realistic, and I say this because everyone may not know that the entire film was shot in front of a blue/green screen, so all the nature shots and sweeping cinematography of various architecture was all digitally animated or super-imposed. Many of the monsters, leppers and hunchbacks were digitally enhanced as well, some were completely done by CGI, and it's easy to tell. There's much to be said for the strengths of CGI in this day and age, but I still have a major problem with it being the backbone of a film's environment and atmosphere, since there's that part of my subconscious that's telling me it's not real and that kind of ruins the plausability of the context. The wolf scene, which was pivotal as foreshadowing, is a prime example of this. A real wolf would have been far more convincing and the impact of the scene would have been much more poignant if this were the case. There are other instances of this, but because of the nature and importance of this one in particular it really stands out in a not so positive way.<br /><br />As for romance, there wasn't really much as there was gratuitous sex, which I didn't mind per se, but it did nothing for the story and for any epic tale there has to be true love and sadly the little that was there was superficial.<br /><br />Story wise it was very straightforward. There was no beating around the bush about who the Spartans were, what they were capable of and what their intentions were, so at least the exposition was effective. There were a fair amount of plot devices but they were rather cliche' and despite the ultimate outcome of the battle as most movie goers probably knew beforehand, much of the secondary plot was so elementary that it was too predictable. The plot behind the scenes of Spartan politics could have elevated the film to a more serious status, but it felt tacked on and honestly it could have been cut out of the film and it would have felt no different. Essentially it served as an excuse to give the main plot a pause, to slow it down a bit because of the intense nature of the battles, so for the sake of pacing, which is important in any film, it worked, but it added little depth to the overall story. The sub-plot definitely needed some fleshing out for it to be truly effective on its own.<br /><br />Now for the action itself. The fighting choreography was excellent, no doubt about it. It's not the best I've seen, but it was certainly thrilling, shocking and gruesome, notably some viscious encounters with freaks from the Persian army. There were a few moments were the fighting was incredibly intense, but throughout the film I wish there had been more of a focus on the actual battle formations and strategy employed, since it was not strictly their fighting prowess that made them legendary but also their brilliant tactics.<br /><br />The interpretation of King Xerxes was unusual, granted it's based on a graphic novel that was inspired by the historical battle, but it worked. It didn't feel entirely original though, since it seemed to borrow heavily from the sci-fi flick 'Stargate' in which an ancient Egyptican god was somewhat androgenous with a contrasting deep, booming voice surrounded by numerous slaves. The look, feel, makeup, jewelry and voice was more than reminiscent of that.<br /><br />Throughout the film the score was relevant, helping to accentuate certain moods and themes, and at times it was completely captivating. The mix of more modern rock music during battles was appropriate while the more classical compositions better suited the moments of silence or reflection of a scene's message.<br /><br />It bears mentioning to point out the freaks and monsters that permeated this film, which added an air of mystery to the events, but with the same token it was kind of distracting since those instances felt so out of place. Of course this goes back to the film being based on a graphic novel which tends to be more liberal with its interpretations than films are, traditionally, but nevertheless it didn't quite work as it should, perhaps this is just my personal preference. Artistically it was intriguing, but as far as making the film any better I'd have to say no.<br /><br />Despite all of it being CGI, the cinematography was of high caliber. A very grand scale was at the heart of the technique and I must say it is impressive how far the technology has come. Some real world locations though would have been even more fascinating. If it would have been filmed in Greece itself, that would definitely have given the film more legitimacy and believability.<br /><br />On the topic of cinematography, the color scheme was too monochromatic, although it was an interesting experimentation with variations of a few key hues such as gold and grey. This again falls back to adapting a graphic novel to the silver screen and I'm pleased to see Hollywood step outside of its comfort zone.<br /><br />All elements considered, this film feels more like an epic poem and the execution was poetry in motion, words put to very fluid action and a rapid, almost non-stop pace, but it's the kind of poem that lacks profoundness and does not challenge the intellectual side of us. Instead, it appeals to our sense of beauty, and not just the traditional form of it, but the beauty that can be found in the grotesque as well as the flawless. Essentially '300' was deeper and more unique than the average war film, particularly with its avant garde visuals and special effects, but nevertheless it fails to break the upper echelon of war epics, such as the likes of 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator'.<br /><br />On a scale of 1-5, I'd have to say 3.9. For me it's not the kind of film I will see again and again, but it's definitely worth watching at least once./> <br />Now for the action itself.

B000HC2LIK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever, and certainly the best film Harrison Ford was ever involved with. Ditto Rutger Hauer. No, on second thought I'd like to edit that to read 'ESPECIALLY Rutger Hauer.'  <br />    <br />\\"Say there, Roger Ramjet!\\" you're probably thinking. \\"What kind of banana oil are you peddlin', bucaroo? Cuz you're in the wrong shop if you're shoppin' fer a sucker!\\" Allow me to explain. Everything about this movie worked. The sets, the cast, the music--everything. This film looks as fresh and evocative as it did when it first aired in the early 80s, and easily gets my vote for 'Most Atmospheric Movie Ever Award'. I can't think of another film that drags you so quickly into it's Reality with the exception of  Star Wars, whose opening scenes gave the audience it's first glimpse at the overwhelming might of the Empire. <br /> <br />I think everyone takes something a little different from Blade Runner. For some it may be a question as to what it is that truly makes us Human, others may see it as a Space Opera romance, others still may find it a chilling warning on current societal trends. The point is that it stimulates thought in almost everyone who sees it, and I find that a wonderful quality given the pre-digested pap we tend to get nowadays. I don't know a great deal about Phillip K. Dick's personal life. He strikes me as being a bit paranoid with an unhealthy fear of the passage of time, but for all I know to the contrary he may have been frequently found with a lamp shade on his head, entertaining the neighbors with comic songs and tap dancing. Hard to say, but either way the man had a tremendous imagination, and this story is among his best.  <br /> <br />Blade Runner can be clinically shown to be the only legitimate example in history of a film that is slightly better than the book it was based on. I give Ridley Scott the credit for that; it was the director who created this convincingly sinister alien landscape for us. I never tire of thismovie, and seem to catch new and quirky details each time I see it. The dialogue is wonderfully surreal in parts, and it's a treasure trove of quotable lines for you and like-minded friends. <br /> <br />The only criticism I could bring would be on the version available on DVD. I did not see Blade Runner in a theatre; my introduction to this classic came by way of the ancient VHS tape. That version contained the commercially released voice-over by Harrison Ford, deleted and seemingly unavailable on any DVD version I can find. I may be in a very small minority here, but I think it was a terrible mistake to cut the VO. Not only did it splash an indispensable aura of Noir chic over the landscape, it was a handy tool for rendering a complex plot into a form more easily grasped by the casual viewer. I sincerely hope that one day a proper DVD will be made available featuring both versions, theatrical release and Directors' Cut. Please allow your fans to also enjoy it in the form they remember it, Mr. Scott! <br /> <br />
B000008LUN|5.0|Back in June of 2000 when I first heard this album, I told myself that it's the greatest hard rock album of all-time.  Of course things change, but I still can find lots of stuff to like about it.   <br /> <br />First of all, even though UFO is probably more of a party rock band that likes to rock out, that's not entirely what the band is about.  The lead singer has an emotionally hoarse and pleasing voice, and it really elevates these hard rock songs to a new level.  If the band had a different lead singer, these songs wouldn't have been nearly as good.  He's a really gifted singer and really wants the listener to experience a feeling of love, instead of just feeling like \\"rocking out\\".  He's all about emotion.   <br /> <br />Also, the guitar playing is really good.  I mean, REALLY good.  Just like the lead singer, he can be emotional on his instrument.  He's also extremely melodic and consistently-pleasing throughout the entire album.  Sure, the guitar solos on this album are a bit longer compared to what other hard rock bands were doing at the time, but remember, everything about this band seems to be about emotion and taking their music a bit further than other rockers at the time. <br /> <br />My favorite songs would be \\"doctor doctor\\" \\"crystal light\\" and \\"queen of the deep\\".  By the way, my version of this album begins with the song \\"too young to know\\" and I recommend you find the version with this song as the opening track because this track order is better, in my opinion.
0060935456|3.0|My sister adored this book. I believe she read it several times as we were engaged in the haphazard pursuit of arriving at maturity and adulthood. I see it's rated nearly 5 stars based on close to 1,000 votes. And yet here I am, making it known to all and sundry that I just never saw the appeal of this book. I tried to read it several times--once out of curiosity, once because of a vague and mistaken impression I had to if I wanted to be 'well-read', and at least twice in my teens because I thought it would show common interests with girls I hoped to impress. I failed utterly on each occasion, flinging myself from the ramparts to escape the relentless patter of furry feet bent on prosecuting their War of Tedium.     It's difficult to analyze this dislike. I enjoy fantasy and sci-fi; it's not as though I find sentient rabbits a very big leap from hobbits and Stormtroopers. Or very big hop, if you will. It's well written in the sense that the words he chooses are pleasantly deployed and harmonious, I just can't march to the tune he's calling. This may well be a love it or hate it kind of book, so the curious reader will have to decide whether or no to gamble. I apologize, sometimes that's just the best I can do. I rated it three stars in recognition of it's fans' abiding love as reflected by the votes here on Amazon, though obviously I enjoyed it from more of what may be called a one star perspective. Never let it be said that I'm not meticulously fair in my ratings!
1582406723|1.0|A friend gave me the first four volumes of The Walking Dead as a birthday gift, knowing that I loved good zombie stories.<br /><br />The story starts by completely lifting the beginning of the film 28 Days Later.  This book started only a few months after that film came out, so I guess Robert Kirkman figured people who enjoy this genre would just forget about it.<br /><br />Kirkman's writing is presentational, convoluted, and overly worded.  Big shock that he's a huge fan of commas.  He has his characters speak about what they're going to do at length, then complete the action in no time; no doubt to leave more panels in the book for Kirkman's brillant (in his mind) dialogue.<br /><br />The pacing is poor.  The characters are trite.  This is nothing new.  You've seen it before and done much better.  How this writer sells books amazes me.  Wake up, people.  The real zombies are the ones who continually read this guy's stuff.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|Damon was acting!? I could have sworn I just spent 3 hours watching someone imitating a fence post with enormous success, but apparently he was meant to be included in the plot. Man, talk about egg on MY face!    Damon plays the same wooden, expressionless character in every paint-by-the-numbers film he appears in; people have become so conditioned to jumping onboard and proclaiming a celebrities' 'brilliance' regardless of quality that he continues to enjoy the inexplicable reputation of a thespian. A proper vehicle for his talent would be to shoot 'Weekend at Bernies 3: Unwatchable Attraction'. He has shown us in 'The Good Sheperd' that he can imitate a lifeless and uninteresting corpse with the best of 'em! No doubt Matt Damon is a pleasant enough person in real life, but I think everyone would be happier if he found himself a job on a road crew or something.       This film was badly edited, and that's putting it mildly. I suppose it was intended to add a sort of 'layered' effect in the plot, though I admit I could easily be wrong. In any event, I found the incessant jumping through decades to be an irritant throughout. The film dragged on and on and ON, introducing characters and plot devices the writers didn't seem to know what to do with . Another problem here is that the characters are, without exception, extremely unlikeable people, and I found myself unable to generate an ounce of warmth for any of them. About 20 minutes into this Marathon of Mediocrity ( Just 13 miles, folks!) I found myself fervently hoping that everyone involved would go away and be drowned together. This hope was, alas, not realized.     Won't somebody please give John Heder a gazillion dollars to make a movie? His vision is fresh and original, two adjetives unconnected with Hollywood since Buster Keaton decided to retire.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|I watched this most amazing pop portrayal of global politics last year. I just had to buy it even though it was so disturbing that it gave me sleepless nights. The acting is flawless, the politics may have some flaws but then, this is part fiction. Nighy and Fiennes are amazing  as usual and so is the main woman protagonist - Rachel. Hard-hitting and worth keeping for a not-so-relaxing watch.

B00004RFFS|5.0|\\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is bar none, one of the best vampire films ever made. Based on the first novel in The Vampire Chronicles, by Anne Rice...Interview is directed by Oscar winner Neil Jordan ('The Crying Game') and scripted by Rice herself. I remember the first time I saw this movie, 6 years ago, and immediately reading the first book. Not only is it a great vampire film, but it's also a terrific literary adaptation. Rice only removed things from the novel that weren't completely necessary and, in doing so, created a brilliant, passionate script. The film stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, and Christian Slater. Seeing these names doesn't really shout \\"masterpiece.\\" Incredibly, every actor is suited very well for their role. <br />The film opens in modern day New Orleans, where a vampire named Louis (Pitt) has agreed to give a reporter (Slater) an interview. The story then jumps back to the late 1700's, where Louis was a 24-year-old, suicidal plantation owner who had recently lost his wife and child in childbirth. His invitation to death is open to anyone, but it is Lestat (Cruise) who accepts his offer. Lestat kills Louis and, before he dies, offers him the chance to live forever. Louis accepts. This offer means that Louis will live forever and stay eternally youthful, but must stay away from sunlight and must feast on the blood of others. Unable to take the lives of humans (something Lestat does with ease), Louis begins feasting on rats and other animals; When Louis ends up taking the life of a young girl, Lestat turns her into a vampire and she becomes Claudia (Dunst), the daughter/lover of Louis and Lestat. Louis and Claudia become a kind of Romeo & Juliet type, but they remain complete opposites. Claudia is more like Lestat, deadly and cruel...Odd, since she hates Lestat. Jumping ahead a bit, Louis and Claudia eventually end up in Europe where they meet Armand (Banderas), the self-proclaimed \\"oldest living vampire\\" and head ofa theatre troupe called The Theatre de Vampyre. I don't want to say much more about the plot to avoid spoilers. When Cruise was cast as Lestat, Rice publicly critisized the decision but later recanted her comments when she saw the film. On the DVD, in the bonus features, she rants about how good Cruise was. And he is incredible, this is one of his best performances. I've only read the first book (I'm currently reading \\"The Vampire Lestat\\"), but Cruise captures this character so well. He's charismatic, good-looking, but capable of being cruel and evil as well. Pitt delivers one of his best performances too as Louis. Louis is a complex character, who needs to a complex performance to really capture him. Pitt handled that completely; Watch his eyes throughout the film and watch how they go from young and youthful to world weary and sad. Dunst, who was thirteen when she made the film (I think), also delivers a spectacular performance. Since the character begins as a child and, by the end of the film, is still a child but with an adult mind; Dunst showed incredibly maturity in the role. Few child actors could have captured the emotion she did. I can not rave enough about this movie. Vampire/Dracula movies are the most cliched and overly used stories out there, but \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is bursting with originality. It's not a horror film, despite it's subject matter. It's really a drama and much of Louis's story is heartbreaking. The gothic look that Jordan gave the film works very well to set the tone and atmosphere of the film. Even if you're a person who despises horror films or movies about vampires, I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B000MNP2KI|5.0|One of the best Bond films if like Bond you will love this.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Murder, incest, and ghosts (?). Sounds like the making of a new horror movie, right? Instead, it's \\"Volver\\" a moving family drama, written & directed by Oscar winner Pedro Almodovar (Best Screenplay, 'Talk to Her'). I've heard of many of Almodovar's movies, but I've never actually seen one. \\"Volver\\" was instantly hailed as one of the best films of 2006, with Penelope Cruz picking up many nominations for Best Actress including an Oscar nod. Cruz plays Raimunda, a Mexican woman with a young daughter Paula and a husband who seems to have an inappropriate attraction to his daughter. Raimunda and her sister Sole are still getting over the death of their mother and father in a fire 4 years ago and now find their aunt (also Paula) dying. Then, Paula (the daughter) suddenly kills her father and Raimunda is forced to get rid of the body. At the same time, Paula (the aunt) dies and Sole comes face to face with her (supposedly) dead mother. Apparently, the mother has come back from the grave to be with Sole and talk to Raimunda...Almodovar doesn't come right out and tell us, but prefers to make us wait. Meanwhile, Agustina, a friend of the family, is dying of a terminal illness and determined to find out what happened to her mother...Who disappeared the same day as Raimunda's mother supposedly died. It's an odd little movie, but it's quite good. Almodovar is working with an almost all-female cast and the ear he has for female dialogue is impeccable to the kind of film he's making. All these characters (I mean, if you ignore the fact that some of them are supposed to be dead) seem very realistic. All the performances here are great, but the real surprise is Penelope Cruz. In America, she's stuck playing the side-kick/love interest in various movies like \\"Sahara\\" and \\"Vanilla Sky.\\" The only time she's really had a chance to show her acting chops was in \\"Head in the Clouds\\" and he character wasn't even in the film that long. In this film, she truly shows what a terrific actress she can be. \\"Volver\\" might not, by my synopsis, sound like your cup of tea but it's a really good movie. I don't know if it's one of the best films of 2006, but I enjoyed it enough to recommend it. <br /> <br />GRADE: B

B000002IAZ|4.0|Buffalo Springfield only had one big hit \\"For What its Worth\\" but their influence was felt beyond their impact on the charts or the sales of the few albums they released.  They helped keep the folk/coutry-rock movement moving and launched the careers of Stephen Stills and Neil Young.  This is a good overview of their brief career, but it is just a song-for-song reissue of the vinyl LP.  They could put twice as many songs on a CD.  It is time for an update with some bonus tracks or an all new release.
B00005JP9V|2.0|Let the buyer beware.  \\"Based on the novel\\" is a remarkably loose interpretation of what one might expect.  As so often in film versions of good books, the plot and characters have been radically altered to suit the vision of a director with no interest in faithful adaptation.  P.D. James' novel contained no Nuclear War, almost no terrorism in England and a distinctly Christian emphasis.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|While this is an excellent collection of some of Young's best work, it is not really a greatest hits collection.  While it includes his biggest hits(Heart of Gold, Old Man, and Only Love Can Break Your Heart), it omits some of his other hits and includes songs that were never even released as singles.  I am a bit surprised that they included both \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" and \\"Southern Man\\" on a single CD, since they are very similar musically.  Of the two I always liked \\"Cowgirl\\" better, \\"Southern Man\\" is clich&eacute; ridden and perpetuates anti-southern stereotypes.  All-in-all this is a solid collection for the casual Young fan.
B000002HPT|4.0|Boy, you people aren't wrong when you say that Dream Theater went a bit commercial on this one because boy did they. I, within the last year or so have really become quite the Dream Theater fan and this was one of the last DT cds to get outside of the Change of Seasons ep and I have to say I was pretty dissapointed. Not that they have to be but I found that Dream Theater was a lot less heavy on this CD outside of the final track and a couple others in between. Thing is, Dream Theater has always been one of the bands that wouldn't give in to the demand of industry standards, etc. because they just want to make good, solid music but they disobeyed themselves with this. Not that they can't do good short songs because they can, it's just a lot of songs on here don't feel like Dream Theater songs. Another thing I feel is that the CD could've cut a couple of the tracks. The early parts to the middle of the CD really has quite a bit of filler; however, I do find that the CD picks up near the end.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm sort of rambling now so I'm going to end it. Basically in a nutshell, this is still Dream Theater so I can't say it's a bad cd but don't expect the usual high par musicianship you generally will get with Dream Theater. This is their weakest effort by far.
B000002KD9|4.0|While this is not one of my favorite Neil Young albums, it is a solid effort.  It was a top ten hit on the US album charts and produced his first solo top 40 hit \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" and the minor follow-up hit \\"When You Dance You Can Really Love\\".  It includes probably his most overrated song, the clich&eacute; ridden \\"Southern Man\\", which is really just a remake of his excellent \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\".  It was popular primarily because it helped perpetuate anti-southern and anti-Christian stereotypes (the only two groups that it is still politically correct to stereotype).  \\"Tell Me Why\\" is a very good song as is \\"After The Gold Rush\\", though Young's vocal limitations are very apparent on this song as he struggles to hit the notes.  \\"Till The Morning Comes\\" is good but sounds like a song that he started but could never finish.  All-in-all, a good album but not a great one.
1427202303|4.0|Child soldiers. A 12 year old carrying an assault rifle and carrying on a tradition of carnage, fear and destruction. It's almost hard to imagine, but you don't have to use your imagination to trace the steps of a boy inducted into a brutal civil war in an African country. His childhood is replaced by a game of life and death where the victim is the child soldier. Ishmael (the author and narrator) tells his life story of death, mayhem and the loss of innocence. Walk with him as he steps into a world a child should never see.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I've given this movie more repeat views than maybe any other movie ever, for two reasons. Firstly, there is the incredible soundtrack--I was not a bluegrass fan until I fell in love with this movie, and the songs were good enough to win me over. Secondly, the dialogue is hilarious. Every time I watch it, I catch a little bit I may have missed before. Coens at their best. Made me rethink my opinion of George Clooney, as well.
0143038419|5.0|I have been a spiritual explorer all of my life, (and food and love), and have had experiences that make the average nasty divorce look like a fun birthday party by comparison.... but this book has helped me tremendously, and all I can say is- thank you Liz for writing it.....
B000FUF6QS|3.0|Much better than the remake. Wanton nudity, song, festival, and it actually seemed as if it were trying to explore religious themes rather than merely present you with a Missing Persons drama. Watch this, and skip the new one.
0340822783|5.0|This book is not your average read, and some people won't enjoy the level of focus it demands.  But I felt that every page was worth it. David Mitchell's talent as an author is so effortlessly sophisticated; I was just more impressed than I remember being about a book in a long time.  I've read others who come across as contrived and 'try-hard', but this author rings true.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is also an incredibly timely book, with current concerns about where we, the human race, are headed being of intensifying focus.<br /><br />Truly excellent stuff...
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|I'm not a fan of gore or violence. I wasn't sure this would be my thing. It is one of the most audacious and shocking things I have ever seen, and I found myself liking it in spite of myself. I've never seen anything quite like it. It is like the most vividly captured nightmare ever.

B000096IBI|5.0|Good laughs. My favorite scene is that with the feeding machine. Even my boyfriend who hates old black and white movies was laughing out loud. Genius.
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|I ordered this movie for my husband. He LOVES it! It's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over. No big plot - but it's got it's moments. I'm quite sure there is something for every European to be offended by... So keep a sense of humor and enjoy.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|It was a well made movie, I'll give it that. But I just wasn't very engaged by it. If one really wants to protect someone, not just make a premise for a movie, I think it is typically a better idea to keep them well-informed than to keep them bumbling in the dark. The ethics of drug research is an interesting topic to me, but it was somehow dulled by the drama.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. <br />I have been a fan of Dennis Quaid ever since Innerspace! The movie is (of course) Hollywood-made and hence over the top. But it's nice entertainment and you can't complain about that!
B00080Z53O|5.0|I avoided this movie for a long time even though it looked like \\"one of those movies\\" I'd like, because the description just sounded so dreary and depressing. Yeah, I shed a few tears, but it was a beautiful movie. I shouldn't have put it off. Give it a try.
B00009RGBS|5.0|This is the musical for people who hate musicals!  My kids and I all belt out the words when the songs come--each song is so unique and original.  This really is an incredible film--the acting is perfect--I love the casting.  Catherine Zeta Jones is so powerful, as is Renee Z.  Ruchard Gere is at his best, as well, which was a cool surprise!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I originally saw this in the theaters because it seemed like a funny premise and Will Ferrell's comic straight man seemed to be a good fit, but I soon realized that this movie was NOT a comedy even though there are several funny parts.  This movie is dramatic.  It is an emotional film that I believe did not get the recognition it deserves as one of the best films of recent years because of preconceived notions about Will Ferrell.  The story is engaging and interesting to begin and completely engrossing and truly climactic at the end.  Emma Thompson and Will Ferrel are brilliant.  I bought this movie on Blu-Ray after watching the movie in theaters and watched it for the second time last night and I can safely say that this is a movie I will watch again and again.  Don't rent this movie.  Buy it!
B000MNP2KI|3.0|What we got here is Rambo meets james Bond. The best Bond for me was Sean Connery and Roger Moore since they both possessed charm and a subtle ruthlessness.. Craig on the other hand is to blunt and rough around the edges. The story overall lacks a big villain. I never got the feeling that Bond was saving the world as was the case with most other bond flicks. The story was interesting enough to keep my attention. The romance was'nt believable. His love interest looked way to conservative to sway a guy like him.
B00005QW5X|5.0|My daughters bought this film and both enjoyed it for its weirdwildness. I can't say that I did, but it's a generational thing I guess.  They especially liked the music, but again I can't say that I did although I'm a musician myself.  Clearly inventive movie making and excellent musicians doing exactly what they want to do, but... I guess it's a generational thing.  I don't particularly like Andy Warhol's flicks, or Broadway musicals, or Wagnerian opera, or John Coltrane, Philip Glass, or Modest Mouse indy music either.  What's an old classical guitarist to do when the Bach D-minor partita is pulled off the music stand and the cross-dressers appear? The topics are not quite my style, although emotionality is the same across the entire human race.  Inventive, wild, weird, very well done, but not my style. <br />Dr. Dude
0141439831|5.0|I picked up this book, and groaned at the sight. 700 pages of dense small text?! Numerous minor characters to remember? Arghhh... <br /> <br />But then, when I finally got enough time to read it, it is brilliant. Thackeray is a great social critic-and many of his criticisms of the upper class could be applied to high school and situations today. The novel is an epic, a journey to be sure, and is better than a current day soap opera, as some of the reviewers said. I thought it was more like Jane Austen - romance + criticism + 5 more families + many more minor relationships.  <br /> <br />I'm definitely looking forward to rereading this book again (maybe not for a while though-it's a LONG book!) when I'm older

B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is the best album, by a band who makes great albums. I guess I am showing my age by calling them albums, but I don't care! <br />This album is great from start to finish, and of any artist, not just U2, that is a hard thing to find. If you can think of your favorite artist of all time, and if you can think of artists whom many consider to be the greats, I challenge you to show me more than 5 albums where the songs are absolutely great from start to finish. This is one of those albums. Inspiring, fun, exciting, and all around great music is what you will get from this purchase. It would be hard to find something better! <br />Joseph Mullaney <br />Brooklyn NYC
B00003CXAT|5.0|What do you get when you mix the collaborative efforts of Steven Spielberg, John Williams, and Stan Winston? Simply put, the greatest film ever made! The directing is superb, the music is unforgettable, and the visual effects are never to be matched. \\"Jurassic Park\\" brings it all to the table in an adventure film for the ages.   I will never forget going to see this movie in the theaters when I was nine years old. For a nine year old to sit down and watch this is mind-blowing to say the least. It was in that moment that I realized I was a \\"movie person\\". I was already a huge fan of Spielberg's \\"E.T.\\", but now I had another movie to love. This is THE MOVIE!

B000EDWKXI|2.0|I always thought it would be a good idea to make a comedy about young Casanova - his incredible adventures, love stories, his struggle with church. Casanova was a fascinating historic figure, a soldier, spy, diplomat, writer, adventurer who will also be remembered as the greatest seducer and lover the world had ever seen (if only from his own words). His life and mystery surrounded him has made him an ultimate hero for many novels, plays, and movies. Sadly, not all Casanova's movies are good and Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m's comedy belongs to the long list of not successful movies. Sure, it is gorgeous to look at - it is 18th Century Venice after all, and locations, photography, Vivaldi's music, costumes, wigs, make up are first class but beyond all this is just another typical chick flick or romcom with Heath Ledger whose Casanova is not that brilliant and fascinating figure but just a cute guy - no more, no less.<br /><br />2.5/5
B000G759LW|5.0|What a great CD!  Love every song, it is better than I thought it would be!
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|The original \\"Thomas Crown Affair\\" directed by Norman Jewison is one of the coolest movies ever made and great fun for all of its 100 minutes - a clever bank-heist caper combined with the sensual romance where both participants (the brilliant bank robber and his match, the sultry and shrewd insurance investigator) are sophisticated, quick-witted and oh so cool. The split-screen technique really works well in this movie and I should mention the song \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" by Michel Legrand that very deservingly received an Oscar - and it does not happen often in the best song categories.<br /><br />The chess game between \\"King Of Cool\\" Steve McQueen and 27 year old Faye Dunaway in the most provocative dress possible is one of the sexiest and most exiting without actual sex involved (my favorite kind of scenes - let my imagination work, let everything happen in my mind) scenes ever filmed. IMO, the 60s was one of the best dressed decades ever with the first wave of mini (and I mean it) skirts and elegant suits and dresses.<br /><br />From Faye Dunaway's interview to \\"USA Today\\" about working with McQueen, \\"We had the most magical spark. Our hearts and souls combined. There was no romance off screen but on screen it was like a smack.\\"
B000HBK3MM|2.0|Didn't really like this CD, not a favorite of mine.  Corinne Bailey Rae fans will like it.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Short review:  must have for bond fans.  Brilliant.<br /><br />First: the product - the packaging, presentation, and extras are wonderful.  Its pretty standard fare in terms of extra content, but its still a \\"must have\\" dvd in my opinion, if you're a Bond movie fan.<br /><br />Next: the bond movie franchise -  I'm a complete Bond snob.  I think Connery is to be commended for helping define the role and \\"give it some meat\\" so to speak.. but I heartily disagree with him being the best bond.  Most prolific, certainly...  but not the best.<br /><br />I'm the type of Bond fan who thinks Roger Moore was just silly - even though I enjoyed his films...  I'm the type of Bond fan that thinks Lazenby captured the spirit of the role the best, and Dalton was the absolute best acted Bond, but was saddled with very poor writers, and a 80's drug war inspired plot line..  weak.<br /><br />I'm neutral towards Brosnan.  I thought he was good - not great, in Goldeneye, but the fact that the storyline was AMAZING only made his own role better.  The rest of his films slowly decline into forgettable, with the last entry being an absolute mess of a bond film.  Where the hell did the writers come from??<br /><br />Now this movie:  I won't bang it as the \\"best bond movie ever\\" - as so many bandwagoners will do - thats doing a complete injustice to earlier films...  But i will happily call it the most \\"complete\\" bond ever.  In this single movie, a debut performance by Daniel Craig...  the spirit, energy and intent of Ian Fleming's bond was captured more completely than the whole of the other performances, save for connery who really started \\"getting there\\" after his fourth bond film.  It wasn't a far reaching plot - the most intense parts were in a small room, centered around a game of no limit, and without much action - and yet it stood you up, called you to attention, and forced you take notice.<br /><br />I'll agree with the many other reviews with one word.  Brilliant.<br /><br />Craig is a refreshing look at bond, reminding me of my favorite, Dalton...  with just the right amount of imperfection to make him human.br /> <br />Craig is a refreshing look at bond, reminding me of my favorite, Dalton...  with just the right amount of imperfection to make him human. <br /> <br />
0743289412|3.0|Pretty good book, a little hard to follow in the beginning.  Not scary, but a pretty good read.
1402720602|5.0|This book is an example of passion with the guitar. It's well written, beautifully photographed covering all steps of classical guitar construction that follows a high grade standard. Even if you don't want to build a guitar, buy it just for the beauty of its pages. I have bought a lot of books about lutherie, but this is one is far the best. <br />It makes evident in every detail how Mr Bogdanovich loves what he do. Seems to me he had a very good time written it. Go deep!

I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone!

0374105235|5.0|I saw an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and was impressed by how well spoken the author was. Reading this memoir is very emotional.  You step inside the world of war in a way that has not been done before.  It is very sad to learn about the life that these poor children have had to endure.  The book was written in a frank, honest nature and I couldn't put it down.  It was very touching, and I would highly recommend it.
0671042858|4.0|I just finished it. Very realistic read. Didn't scare me, but it entertained me well. Stephen King is still keeping up that great writting style of his. I would recomend this to fans of his, but if you want to see a great king book, check out, Christine, Carrie, and Salem's Lot. Still I recomend it though.

B000N3ST7K|5.0|Any time a new Tarantino movie comes out, I'm amazed at how much I love the music. Even though the music is rarely in my preferred genre. I'm a hard rock lover, and Tarantino's tastes lie more in the field of pop/rock. Usually older, lesser-known pop/rock. He has an amazing talent for plucking these forgotten songs out of obscurity and using them to stunning effect in his films. Death Proof is no exception. As usual, it contains of wide variety of musical styles. The soundtrack features the likes of T. Rex's Jeepster, Jack Nitzsche's The Last Race, Ennio Morricone, and a wonderful pop song from forgotten '60s pop group, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich called Hold Tight. The real gem on the soundtrack, in my opinion, is April March's Chick Habit, which appears over the end credits. As one reviewer previously stated, once you hear it this song will remain with you for a long time. But that's okay, it's a great song. Where does Tarantino find this music? He's a great filmmaker and a genius with soundtracks. Check out this music, it's the perfect companion piece to Tarantino's excellent film, Death Proof. The better of the two [[ASIN:B00005JPNF Grindhouse]] features in my opinion. One of the reasons that Death Proof is so good is this wonderful, distinctive soundtrack. Fantastic from beginning to end.

B00005JNX0|4.0|The movie was cute and made me laugh in several places.  As with most kids movies these days, it has some entertainment for the adults.  As mentioned before the \\"I like to move it, move it\\" song part was fun and entertaining.  The one part that I found to be disturbing was the spitting out of water and worry that my little one will mimic that.  Overall I would watch this movie and if you like it, buy it, I think there will be those that will want to keep it.

006056251X|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I couldn't wait to finish one book so I could start the next in the series.  I highly recommend reading them in order as each book starts where the last one left off.  The first is \\"The Secrets of a Summer Night\\", followed by \\"It happened one Autumn\\", then \\"The Devil in Winter\\" and finally \\"Scandal in Spring\\".  Lisa Kleypas makes these characters come to life and makes you feel that you are part of their adventure.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is such a great, nostalgic film. Napoleon Dynamite is one of those characters you don't quite figure out at first glance, but slowly gets you. Him, his geeky bother, his way-too-stuck-in-1982 uncle and his not-quite-there friend Pedro are here to stay.  See the movie, it's worth it.  The soundtrack is also a fantastic selection you will love and, finally, don't go missing the special features included.  They are an inspiration for those wanting to make way into filmmaking.
0143038419|1.0|Pure unadulterated drivel. I couldn't even get to page 20, let alone page 48 with the political faux pas several readers have complained about.  I am soooooooooo thankful I checked this out of the library.  I would have been sad to have wasted one penny on this twaddle.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Not that I am one, but I so wish I were.  The Big Lebowski is, in my opinion, the wittiest feature by the Coen Brothers.  I've seen it so many times already, and yet find new gags every time I look at it again.  Almost 10 years after its launching, this film is expanding its charm to a very loyal and very dude-like group of excentric Costa Ricans!.
B000002UA2|4.0|let's get right to it: the title track kicks things off, music rumbles up from out of the ether, spacey guitar licks join in, nice little instrumental. music with a bit of tension. track 2 is not as good, a pretty forgettable instrumental. luckily it's short, you'll most likely live through it and discover the better stuff that lays beyond. track 3 is the first vocal on the album, a soft gentle breezy piece. not bad at all. track 4 finds the gang getting into a hard rock groove. nice guitar solo. fine enough. track 5 nice vocal, beautiful acoustic guitar melody. mid-tempo, full of lazy grace. very good. track 6 is the best instrumental on the album. starts in a dreamy haze, breaks into some fine guitar work, then synthesizers and the guitar swirl around together a bit until more guitar soloing closes things out. excellent. track 7 is a fine song that sounds more like the pink floyd known to the general public. a gilmour vocal and a great gilmour guitar solo. this would sound right at home on later, more famous pink floyd albums. it really would. track 8 is the best song to be found here, an extremely catchy little ditty about aging and death and that sort of thing. very hummable. fun despite the subject matter. rocks hard at the end with some searing guitar licks. track 9 is a fine mid-tempo number, sweet and sentimental. no complaints. and finally, track 10 is an instrumental with a vague melody. spacey keyboards and synthesizer stuff. the album ends with what sounds like children and old people chanting not all that pleasantly in some language i never bothered to learn. so that's it. that's \\"obscured by clouds\\" by the great pink floyd. if you are only going to own one or two of their albums i would say don't bother with this. they have better work out there. however, if you already have their classics and want to add on to your collection, this is a good album. i'm not sorry i got the thing. not a bit.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|Not being a James Bond addict this viewer approached CASINO ROYALE in the quiet of the home with the DVD form of the film.  For the first time the unique appeal of this 007 character makes sense under Daniel Craig's interpretation.  Prior Bond films with the varied actors who have portrayed him have gone for the slick, tricky, smart killing machine whose eyes seemed  always on the outlook for the next gorgeous babe he treated with little respect except for physical favors.  The various villainous characters seemed to blend and the stories appeared to be more interested in that tired musical soundtrack theme and carnage than they were in character development.<br /><br />Enter Daniel Craig, all buff and uber-masculine, and the beginnings of James Bond's character are explained in a touching manner, making this machine-like concept a deeper being.  Of course, credit must go to director Martin Campbell working with an intelligent script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade which travels Craig's Bond from Uganda, to the Bahamas, Miami, Montenegro and Venice.  The chief bad guy this round is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who complete with scarred blind eye and cruel gaze is Bond's nemesis.  Judi Dench turns in another strong performance as the ubiquitous 'M' on charge of 007's ventures and along the way Bond meets such good/bad characters as Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, and the very elegant and stylish French actress Eva Green whose complex character provides all the information we needed to know about James Bond's view of women.<br /><br />CASINO ROYALE is a strong 2 1/2 hour film that for this viewer makes James Bond an interesting character in addition to being a suave stunt/lady-killer man.  Daniel Craig is in fine form (literally) and proves his mettle here.  This viewer will see the next Bond/Craig film in the theaters!  Grady Harp, April 07
B0009IW88A|5.0|Great movie and Great soundtrack - if your a Batman fan buy both
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have seen most all the James Bond movies. My favorite actors have been Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnon, but Craig Daniels has surpassed them both. Because the story was about a person with some indepth story line. It was intense and active, but Daniel Craig was the reason. It was the best 007 movie yet. I hope the producers continue in this vein.
0800141601|5.0|Not alot of critics liked this movie and it didnt do great but I loved it- I am playing it on my new Toshiba HD dvd and it is great on that machine.

The first with the horses running across the field at night is great. I lost my first copy after 25 plays or so and bought another on Amazon.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|I actually against tradition  liked P. Brosinan better than S. Connery and this new Bond is very physical and is actually pretty good BUT he is shorter and even though built well and handsome in a rugged way still doesnt strike me as a ladies man so I am having trouble buying him as Bond - Maybe in time - the movie is very good and I will watch a few more times to let it grow on me
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I found this film to be one of the most confusing I have seen in years. The story line was extremely weak and by the end of the film I was wondering why it was even produced.
B000GZULEO|5.0|This watch is even more beautiful than it looks in the picture. It has only one detail that was a surprise for me and it is that the coloured details on the sides are plastic, but they look nice anyway.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|What's so great about this miniseries?  For me, it was that the storyline isn't utterly vapid - it's not a complicated, deep film, but there are several plotlines and many things happening to make you think.  The credit goes to Miss Gaskell, of course, but Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe do a fantastic job interpreting their characters.  I was enthralled from start to finish and cared as much for the peripheral characters as the leads.  It's not better than Pride and Prejudice - it's equal to it, at least production-wise.  North and South simply fills a different need.  Highly recommended.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|I had fairly high expectations for this movie.  It seemed like it might be interesting. <br /> <br />Im glad I saved my money from going to see it at the theater.  I'm out $2 from the video store.  Thats $1 more than it was worth. <br /> <br />I was very dissapointed in the movie.  The story was just plain bizarre.  It didn't seem to flow very well.  Characters that you would have expected to have larger parts, die, early on. It did not seem very well thought out. <br /> <br />After wondering about this so called \\"Human Project\\" thing the whole movie, we are left hanging at the end as to what it really is.   <br /> <br />I should have got the penguin movie instead.......

B000MQC9H4|2.0|This movie was a big dud.  Trying to pair Jack Black up with any reasonably decent looking women (including Winslet) just isn't believable.  Trying to portray Jack Black as a serious guy...just doesn't work.  All Cameron Diaz can do is smile her big giant, goofy grin. She has no substance to her acting and her characters are usually fairly dull and/or ditzy. <br /> <br />This was a waste of time. <br /> <br />

B000NDIAWO|1.0|Beyoncé is a prime example of what has become of the music industry as a whole: profit over artistic integrity. One has to seriously question the timing and the genuiness of her ventures in recording in Spanish, featured in this \\"Deluxe Edition\\".     As a recent television appearance proved, Beyoncé has virtually no knowledge of the language and had to be taught phonetically to sing the Spanish lyrics. This hardly sounds like someone who has a long time  appreciation for the language.    This may be an opinion held by only a few, but these Spanish language tracks are nothing more than a business move and a shameless attempt to capitalize on the recent surge in sales of music made popular by Latino audiences. She is only fleecing this sector of the music buying public.    It would be almost a certainty that, if music popular with Russians was currently dominant on the charts, Beyoncé would be on TV expressing she has always had a love of Russian culture and \\"this is for all my Russian listeners!\\" If there should be a lull in Latin music popularity in the future, she will quickly change her tune.    As detestable as it might have been, it would have been better for Beyoncé to confess that this Spanish phase on the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is a mere marketing ploy instead of disguising it as a sincere love for the culture. The title of her recent single may aptly describe Beyoncé at this point in time: a \\"Beautiful Liar\\".

B0007VZ9DK|5.0|i looooooove this movie. Bob DeNiro is SO good in it. and Joe Pesci too. and of course especially Sharon Stone. wow, didn't realize she could act until i saw this. amazing acting. even down to the extras its good acting. it feels so real. and this movie has my all time fave scene; when Sam sees Ginger for the first time, and Mickey and Sylvia's \\"Love is strange\\" song comes on, and Gin makes a scene, throwing chips, and Sam, who can obviously stop and throw her out doesn't, but just stares mesmerized at her. and she know she's got him. she leaves looking at him and laughing. that scene is SO SEXY. this movie also has some good, old time songs. Scorcese really took his time to make this. but major WARNING: seriously, it's NOT FOR KIDS. even i can't watch manyo its scenes they are so realistic and gruesome. that's the only thing that i don't like about it, that it's violence makes it unwatchable some times. but isn't that still good b/c it shows what great acting it is?! if u don't watch this u haven't watched a real movie. one of the bset movies ever made!

B00005JMJG|4.0|<br />I've never been a big fan of Jim Carrey....the guy is just a little too mainstream, too glib, and too cocky most of the time for my taste. <br /> <br />Having said that, in this film, he actually plays a pretty likeable character. <br /> <br />The story is about a guy and his girlfriend who separately decide they want to erase each of their memories of the other.  This process is supposed to be painless and \\"invisible\\" to the patient, but for some reason, Carrey's character, Joel, experiences many of his memories of his girlfriend as they're being erased, and tries desparately, but unsuccessfuly, to hold on to them. <br /> <br />The \\"undoing\\" of Joel's memories is often surreal and mildly disturbing.  In the end, as fate would have it, both Joel and his girlfriend meet again, now without the memories of each other.   <br /> <br />The movie does a nice job of conveying the message that it's easy to become complacent in a relationship....maybe to think that \\"the grass is greener somewhere else\\".   <br /> <br />All too often, it's not until later that one realizes what one had till it's gone.

0143038419|4.0|This book is an interesting recount of the author's year-long journey to Italy, India, and Indonesia to find inner peace and fulfillment after enduring personal hardship and strenuous circumstances.  While Gilbert can be raw and seemingly arrogant at times in the narrative, she puts a lot on the table for one to consider and makes many insightful points along the way.  Of particular interest is her time in India where it seems like true healing is beginning to take hold.  The spiritual transformation that takes place during the course of the book is apparent yet accessible and gives hope to those navigating through their own personal battles that it is possible to recover and move into a higher place spiritually and leave all the baggage of this world behind.   <br />
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is one the most powerful movies I have ever seen. The story of Scotlands fight against Brittish imperialism. The concepts of freedom and living under bondage presented in this movie, really opened my eyes to what it means to be controlled, and the fact that it is ultimately up to you ,there are always other options. Fighting against your oppressors, begins in your mind first. The fight scenes are incredible and ultra violent,so you may want to becareful with little ones.From, sad heart wrenching loss ,to stand up and cheer,a fine movie. About the will and determination and strength of the human spirit.
B00003CXC6|5.0|In the Bible, Pilate asks, \\"What is truth?\\" and, as Roger Bacon puts it, \\"would not stay for an answer.\\"<br /><br />I felt a bit the same way after seeing this remarkable film by Japan's celebrated film maker, Akira Kurosawa.  It is set in 12th century Japan, and while most viewers would say it examines the nature of truth and finds it slippery, I think it more properly examines the nature of the feudal Japanese society.<br /><br />We have as representatives of that society, a priest (Minuru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) sitting out a rain storm in a place called Rashomon.  It might pass for a ruined Greek temple except that its pillars and roof are made of wood.  The priest and the woodcutter declare that they just can't understand it.  They shake their heads and stare at the ground.  Along comes a commoner (Kichijiro Uedo), a cynical man who asks what it is that they cannot understand.<br /><br />They have witnessed an investigation into the death of a samurai, Takehiro (Masayuki Mori).  He is in some ways the equivalent of a medieval knight.  He has a horse and lady, Masako (Machiko Kyo).  The accused is an infamous outlaw named Tajomaru (played brilliantly by Toshiro Mifune, who obviously had a lot of fun with the part).  He tells his story.  He admits to having his way with the lady, but lets the court know that she liked it so much that she began to embrace him while her husband was tied up watching.  Afterwards he says that she insisted that they fight over her.  Tajomaru obliges.  He cuts the rope holding Takehiro and they sword fight.  Tajomaru wins.<br /><br />Next the wife tells her story.  It is different of course.  This causes the court to get a medium (Fumiko Honma) to tell the story from the point of view of the dead Takehiro.  His story is different yet again.  Finally the woodcutter reveals to the priest and the commoner that he saw the whole thing, and he then gives his version, again different of course.<br /><br />The commoner has some terrifically cynical lines.  Here are three:<br /><br />\\"It's human to lie. Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.\\"<br /><br />(To the priest:) \\"Not another sermon! I don't mind a lie if it's interesting.\\"<br /><br />\\"Man just wants to forget the bad stuff, and believe in the made-up good stuff. It's easier that way.\\"<br /><br />He speaks for the natural or animalistic man.<br /><br />His counterpoint, the priest, opines, \\"If men don't trust each other, this earth might as well be hell.\\"<br /><br />He speaks for moral man.<br /><br />Near the end of the film a baby is discovered crying.  The woodcutter, who has five or six children of his own, takes the baby home.<br /><br />He represents civilized man.<br /><br />Masako represents the samurai's view of the nature of women when she is heard to say, \\"A man has to make a woman his by his sword.\\"<br /><br />What impressed me most about this film is the way Kurosawa was able to create an emotional atmosphere in each of the sittings.  \\"In the Grove\\" we feel the trees and the light that sparkles through the leaves, and the disturbed serenity.  At Rashomon in the rain we feel the men isolated and waiting, and in the sterile court scene we feel the severity of the tragedy.e three:     \\"It's human to lie.

B000NA28IE|3.0|Having not read the book I can't say how well they did in comparison, however I do have to agree that it felt very underdeveloped despite my ignorance to the original story. It had such potential to be great but ended up mediocre. I'm not sure if Edward S. is a bad actor or badly directed. I'm leaning towards the latter since he did manage to pull it off at times. The wierd \\"eye widening\\" that happened oftem didn't seem genuine and when he made his way to the fallen Saphira after the final battle I almost laughed at the way he \\"struggled\\" to reach her. It would have been better if he'd crawled a foot or two, then dragged himself to his feet then hurried as much as his battered body would allow until he collapsed at her side. Typed out is sounds just as lame as what actually happened but in the mind it looks better than both. <br /> <br />Plus, what was with the funky editing? Are we telling a story or a series of scenes? It got better as it went along but at the beginning it was a bit painful. <br /> <br />And fianlly, the final battle. Was there actually a battle or just a dragon burning everything in site? As it was told in the movie, I fail to see how having a dragon on their side made any real difference. Where's the give and take? Where's the back and forth betwen the bad guy getting ahead and the good guys getting their shot. Where's the sudden burst of inspiration that leads to an unexpected twist that finales in a win for the good guys? <br /> <br />Maybe I expect too much after LOTR. As my sister said, this was no Helm's Deep. A poor man's Helm's Deep.  <br /> <br />I don't feel the original writing was that bad. I get the feeling there was more to the battle but we didn't get to see it.  <br /> <br />There's forshadowing and then there's just giving away the end. <br /> <br />That said, Eraon was entertaining to watch,as I said, if you've never read the book , which I haven't.  <br /> <br />Once again. Lots of potential but very underdeveloped plot and characterwise.
0307346609|3.0|Not literature by any means, Max Brook's editors have crafted a decent laugh in exploring the contingencies that might occur if a mass zombie outbreak were to occur simulaneously accross the earth.  Most of these steps are fairly logical, and the oral history that outplays gets better at engrossing as it goes along.  The actions of Israel in particular are noteworthy, though perhaps in real life it wouldn't have happened so easily, but i also must note that the futures of some nations such as cuba are unintentionally hillarious. <br /> <br />This was not the book i wanted, as a concept, when i started reading it, and it did not fufill the promises i gave to it.  It would have been nice for this to be more literate, i mean, for it to be literature, but what we do have is still a decent, polished if not grand, collection of parables about surviving or not zombies. <br /> <br />If you;re just a person casually intersted in zombies, pass this up and go watch DAY OF THE DEAD to actually FEEL all of the things that Mr. Brooks writes about his characters feeling in this book.

B00003CWNR|5.0|If you read John Irving's books, you'll encounter quotes like these from time to time - all humorous, serious and significant to the story. Irving 's orphan heroes are made to feel that despite being 'unwanted' by society, they were given the most regal title by Dr. Larch so they know they are loved and important. Dr. Larch knows about people and their flaws, and life and it's inevitable tragedies and miracles. You have the same chance of being brought up in riches as you do being raised in an orphanage. Circumstances create all kinds of situations where your life (or death) could change with one mistake or 'choice'.  <br />Irving himself grew up a princely comfortable life in New England, and many of his stories take place in his home state (New Hampshire) and surrounding Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts. He often depicts likeable, quirky characters brought up in 'provincial' New England. That being said, I can attest that Irving is no snob. He's a brilliant writer and his books are among my favs! A Prayer For Owen Meany is a treasure! ~ Enjoy this book and 'spot on' screenplay/film!  Jayne Tyau

B00002Z88D|5.0|This album transforms all of the Metallica classics into works of art while at the same time introducing new cuts into the mix. The addition of a full orchestra to heavy metal hits is remarkable and elevates Metallica to a place that no other metal band has ever been before. This is truly one of the best rock albums to come out in a long time. All of the greatest hits are played to perfection and the recording is top-quality. Songs that were released by Metallica in the 80s and early 90s have new life. A must-have for all heavy metal rockers!

B000MCIBE8|5.0|Taken from last year's \\"Perception\\" box set,the groundbreaking debut album from Jim Morrison and company is yet again remastered/remixed,but this time its done at the correct speed-the previous LP/CD versions ran at a slower pace,thus its pitch was different than it was intended until now.In addition,the mix is clearer,punchier and more directness(especially the vocals and guitars) than even the fine 1999 remaster had.Plus there's a colorful,informative booklet featuring lyrics,rare photos,notes from Doors engineer Bruce Botnick and an essay from famed rock writer Ben Fong-Torres.Since there is no dispute of the quality of the music contained here(honor roll:\\"Break On Through\\",\\"Light My Fire\\",\\"Soul Kitchen\\",\\"Crystal Ship\\"and the 11-minute epic \\"The End\\"),this is simply a piece of music history no rock fan should be without.And this is the end of my review.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|\\"Planet Earth is quite simply the greatest nature/wildlife series ever produced.\\" This quote by Amazon is an major understatement.  This series is the best production of any kind ever produced and or distributed for TV - period.  No words that I am capable of using would adequately describe this must-see series.  Mark Twain would have been flaborgasted and speachless!  It is the reason to own a HDTV.  I have a 70 inch HDTV that made this production all the more enjoyable.  I do not yet own a HD Disc player as I have been appalled by the HD format struggle.  I give the HD DVD format a big thumbs for lowering their player prices much quicker that the Blue-Ray format and will purchase their version of this BBC Series - as soon as a dual-format player is competitively priced.  Every person on this planet should/must see this series.  God Bless the BBC.
0060931736|5.0|This is a profound, but surprisingly amusing novel set in Edinburg, Scotland during the early twentieth century. The main character, Jean Brodie, is a spinster and something else which you do not figure out until later. She has an unorthodox teaching style that pits most of the staff of the Marcia Blane School for Girls against her. The Brodie Set are six girls who get her special attention and are molded to become prototypes of their role model. Each one of the girls is known for a special talent or quality: Monica for anger, Sandy for her eyes, Jenny for her beauty, Mary for her stupidity, Eunice for gymnastics and Rose for sex.     I thought this book was funny and very profound and as a short, but fascinating read I highly recommend it.
B000O178BY|5.0|With all the innovative and creative precursors to this album, I'm sure Trent has been on the spot to deliver a product that could match the anticipation.  And wow...I have no words to describe how amazing this album is.  Never have I heard a concept album that envelops you like this (dare I say, it's better than Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\"!).  Year Zero is a noisy masterpiece that will define rock music perfection.  You'll have to listen to it several times just to make sure you get all the lyrics and messages...just to make sure you capture the essence of the \\"characters\\" in this record. <br /> <br />The \\"noise\\" in this album is tastefully done...enhancing the music rather than making it noisy for the sake of being noisy.  The flow of the record, in typical NIN fashion, has been carefully thought through.  The result is an experience of a bleak, torn future full of despair and injustice.  I'm not going to point out any individual tracks...because they're all equally important in this story.  However, you won't be disappointed.  There really isn't a single weak song on this album. <br /> <br />Buy it...you'll be glad you did!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you want to see an intelligent and informed documentary on global warming, I highly suggest this movie.  This documentary was well done and Al Gore was very compelling and impressive.  Mr. Gore has surpassed my previous expectations and in my opinion, has positioned himself to be an even more worthy candidate for president in the upcoming 2008 eleciton.  I challenge you to compare the well spoken abilities and highly competent attributes of this man with the clueless and misinformed cretin currently holding office.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|It is rare that a film comes along which not only appeals to my fascination for the surreal but can also be watched by my mother-in-law.  This is one of those. <br /> <br />Will Ferrell is not in bizarre comic mode like in many of his other films.  In this he plays a boring guy reacting to strange situations like pretty much everyone else would, and he does it brilliantly. <br /> <br />My only criticism is that the humour is mostly reserved for a few laugh our loud moments and is absent for much of the rest.  Plus Queen Latifa's character is pretty redundant and adds nothing to the film other than to get the writer to talk about what she is thinking. <br /> <br />All in all, a great film <br />

It is another of the Disney hits that keeps both children and parents interested and has stuff for all age groups within the movie.  All four of my kids, 11, 7, 5 and 3 love it!  Both the boys (11, 3) and the girls (7,5).   <br /> <br />A great movie on how to get along with others and not focus only on yourself.
B00005JP1C|5.0|Not since the movie Stigmata has there been an amazing religious-themed thriller such as The Reaping that once again challenges Christian belief!  Look past any controversy this movie dukes out with Bible thumping crazies, and try to appreciate it for it's true cinematic pleasure.  You will NOT be disappointed.  This movie is a white knuckle thrill ride for those of us who enjoy a good scare.<br /><br />Hilary Swank plays a former Christian missionary who now specializes in debunking religious phenomena, who has been called upon to investigate a small Louisiana town which seems to be suffering from the 10 Biblical plagues. Kudos to the film crew staying down south in between Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita to continue filming! At first, the small town of Haven seems like any Maple Drive all-American town but I had trouble believing we were deep in voodoo country.  Hilary's assistant is the only black man in town!  But all that is quickly thrown aside when the two accompany officials to take a look at the town river that has turned red.  The Spanish moss-laced scenery is breath taking and you will soon be settled in for a good chill that doesn't go away so easily.<br /><br />One by one, the ten plagues start to affect the town and are linked to a backwoods family shunned by the towns folk.  Hilary and her assistant investigate but have trouble dismissing the plagues with the help of science.  It all builds up to a magnificent locust attack scene that you MUST see on the big screen.  I haven't seen anything as fun since Hitchcock's The Birds, and can't wait to see it again on DVD.<br /><br />With a twist at the end that you will never guess, there is hope for a sequel!

B000MXPE7O|3.0|This movie is a fictionalized oral history of the genesis of the CIA, from its early days as the \\"Office of Strategic Services\\" through the Bay of Pigs debacle.  Its real story is the sacrifice that its protagonist \\"Edward Wilson\\" (Matt Damon) makes in order to serve the agency.  The Wilson character is a loose fictionalization of real-life former CIA Deputy Director for Counterintelligence James Jesus Angleton.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, and it is full of atmosphere, good dialog, and interesting historical background. There are lots of minor appearances by big stars such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, William Hurt, and others. What this film sorely lacks is a solid plot.  There simply isn't one, which is surprising.  Essentially the film takes the Wilson character at about the Bay of Pigs time frame, into a series of flashbacks, as we see how his entire life has centered around his devotion to the CIA to the exclusion of all else.  The \\"plot\\" if there is one, is simply this theme: that Wilson sacrifices all, family, fatherhood, his marriage, to serve the CIA.  During World War II and its aftermath, he simply disappears to his new wife for six years, and when he abruptly returns, he is not surprisingly a stranger to her.  This indifference to family in favor of career and devotion to duty is the real theme of this film.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film for its atmosphere and subject matter, but the lack of a plot is impossible not to miss and regret, because this could have been a great movie.  Cold War espionage offers limitless possibilities for telling a solid story (i.e. one with a plot and solid storyline) and the story of James Jesus Angleton is a fascinating one that would make for a superb film, properly done. This piece, however, does not succeed in being that film. That is truly unfortunate.<br /><br />Angleton fought for years to prevent KGB infiltration of the CIA, and this caused an awesome amount of turmoil within the Agency.  After Angleton left as head of Counter-intelligence, a series of catastrophes ensued within the CIA.  We were treated to the Walker spy scandals, Aldrich Aimes, the Hansen betrayal, and other counterintelligence debacles of the type that Angleton prevented during his watch.  He truly was \\"The Good Shephard.\\"  Unfortunately, this film fails to really tell this story, and leaves the viewer wishing for more plot and less atmosphere.left as head of Counter-intelligence, a series of catastrophes ensued within the CIA.

From my understanding, (and like I said I have not finished reading the book) it has the concept of \\"Name it, Claim it\\". \\"If you picture it, you will have it\\"  If it were that easy, don't you think we would all be living the grand life?  I did apply the concept of \\"picture it and you will have it, and what do you know, it didn't work.  If God does not have what you want in his plan for you, then it is just not going to happen.  I guess, when I finish reading the book, I could make a better assesment of what I understand the book to be saying.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|If you like romance, English accents, and \\"clean\\" movies you will like this one. I love Jane Austens books. It is definately worth every penny you spend to purchase it. I highly recommend it.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Absolutely loved this CD.  The slow songs are less than desireable.  But the variety on the album is great.  Especially the Map of the Problematique is the favorite off this CD not only for myself but for others I have played the CD for. Skipping the two or three slow songs are worth the price you pay.
0800141660|5.0|This is one of the BEST movies ever. If you are like me, I have a hard time finding \\"clean\\" movies to watch. This is one of those. It takes you back in time. I live with a house full of guys, they won't sit and watch it. So I save it for some \\"me time\\". The actors are top notch. Highly recommend.
B000AMPZF8|3.0|This CD is an obvious beginner for Muse.  A few songs are ok, but overall, get their newer stuff.  Especially if you are new to Muse.  Took a risk on this one and it didn't pay off.  Some may like it, but again, personal preferrence.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I own John Mayer's first two albums, but hesitated to buy this one. I was a FOOL. This may be the best one yet. If you like bluesy, groovy music with great lyrics and you don't mind a bit of love-lorn navel gazing, this one is for you. My favorite is \\"heart of life\\" - try it out and see if you're hooked!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm becoming more of a Muse fan after purchasing this CD.  Black Holes and Revelations was my first Muse CD and Butterflies and Hurricanes was my first Muse song experience (which is on this CD).  This seems to be a great compilation of Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, and Queen inspired music.  Highly recommended.  Can't bring myself to like their slower songs on any of their CD's, but this is personal preference.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|I received the product exactly in time, I was so happy. It was a present and the person really like it. The presentation was the same I saw on the review.<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the product.
B00009YNGA|4.0|I love this album by Britney. Lost of great music. The whole album makes you want to dance. If ypu like Pop music this is the album for you.
B000O178BY|5.0|The title pretty much sums it up, but more specifically...Since The Downward Spiral, this is the type of CD I've been waiting for from Trent.  I love all of his music he has been making since The Downward Spiral like you wouldn't believe.  The Fragile, a master piece, W_T has some excellent songs on it, but this is the CD I've been waiting for for a long time, and Trent came through.  Heck, he always comes through, but this CD is amazing on a whole new level.  Take time to listen to this YZ several times over, each time it gets better.  I find great CDs will do that.  Trent explores a whole new realm of music style that is just mind blowing, and artistic beyond words.  Noise has never sounded so good.  Songs like God Given, Capital G, Good Soldier, and Me I'm not are amazing.  Sum Zero is a very low key (relative to the rest of the CD), yet powerful song almost anyone will like.  W_T was a good CD (though has some amazing songs on it), but YZ is a great CD.  Buy it!
B000MCH5P4|1.0|The concept for this film was a good one.  But the execution of the concept was dreadful.  Brad Pitt can't act so he was not given much of a part.  However, even if he could act, it wouldn't have saved this film from the trash can that I put it in.   <br /> <br />I felt sorry for the \\"wife\\" of Brad Pitt.  She spent the whole film face down in the dirt.  For someone who was shot she did manage to bleed very little  and hung on until she could be rescued. There was a lot of gratutious sex, which--if it fit into the story wouldn't have been so bad--but it seemed that it was just something that the film maker put in because the story line was so weak.  It was a poor choice and I hope the screen writers find work picking vegetables and leave the stories to those who actually have writing abilities and imaginatiion.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Neon Bible is the second album from this group that blows me away. Their first album \\"Funeral\\" may be a little better than \\"Neon Bible\\" but I can't put it away. This group is very creative, has a big sound and uses every instrument know to man. I love the use of an orchestra on several songs. Keep the Car Running, Black Wave, The Well and the Lighthouse and No Cars Go are incredible songs that demand to be listened to over and over, the louder the better. I have heard some of my peers complain that there is no good new music, forget that and listen to Arcade Fire.
1416914285|1.0|So I borrowed a copy of this book from my friend, who hadn't bothered to finish it.  Beyond its convoluted, almost-unreadable prose and flat, predictable dialog, City of Bones is a book begging for an editor.  Any editor.  Worse than the misused words within the novel, there are misspelled words that weren't corrected before publication.  Everything's been written before, but everything in City of Bones has been done better elsewhere.  The glaring parallels to Star Wars, in particular, can't be ignored.  If you're jonesing for poorly edited fiction full of recycled ideas and featuring a lead character who serves as a wish fulfillment proxy for the author (Clary? Clare?), [...]
B00005JNS0|5.0|Adorable! Enjoyable for car lovers of any age. Action, adventure and romance, set in beautiful and imaginative scenery. The animation is incredible. The plot is simple, but entertaining.
1845761502|5.0|Of all the books I own this one satisfies my passion for monster movies as well as my passion for art. Filled with gorgeous high quality photos and in depth insight into each creature and character this book is better than watching it in a movie! The hard work and creative inspiration that goes into each creature of Stan Winston's is truly awe inspiring. It makes me want to work in his studio!
B000MXPE74|5.0|There really isn't much not to like about the Fratellis.  They have a unique style, in your face but in no way uninviting.  While most of the lyrics will need to be read over before they are audibly understood, the general pop and feel of the group's over the top tunes are what keep you interested.  Can't wait for more of this stuff.  I think I've listened to it every day since purchasing it.  The EP's great, too.
B000002MU3|4.0|CD arrived on time and the CD itself is in excellent conditon . The price was good BUT the CD case was damaged .
0823003590|2.0|I did not find this book very helpful to me. I did not like the pictures .They did not provide good examples to follow.
0525457585|5.0|I have always been one of those people that sees a movie and must read the book.  Well since I had grown up watching The Neverending Story on the Disney Channel, it had never really occured to me that there maybe a novel of the same title, so I must admit my surprise when browsing through a bookstore, I came across this fantastic book.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves being captured in a story.  I first read this novel when I was in 6th grade, and now that I am about to graduate college, I have probably read this book 10 times since and everytime I find another reason to love it.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|Excellent DVD to own.  Daniel Craig is outstanding.  Move over, Sean Connery. The female touch of Barbara Brocoli is evident especially in the opening credits and throughout the film.  Even the theme song is by a male.  (Althogh I would have chosen an Alison Goldfrappe song any day!!!  Absolute perfection for a James Bond  film).  Daniel Craig emerging from ocean (not once, but twice) is sight to behold.   <br />Excellent film - non-stop action and some incredible special effects particularly in Venice.  SHOULD HAVE WON AN OSCAR OR BAFTA FOR FILM AND ACTOR.   <br />Definately worth purchasing because of the second DVD with all the extras.
B00005176F|4.0|A few years ago, I heard Blur's single \\"There's No Other Way\\" for the first time...then, I rushed out and bought 'The Best of Blur'! When I listened to the whole compilation, I recognized 'Song 2' and 'Girls & Boys' as radio singles but, aside from the those aforementioned songs, I was unfamiliar with the rest of the material. Compared with their \\"rival band\\" Oasis, I don't think Blur got the sort of exposure they deserved in America but, hey, now's the time for people to get 'The Best of Blur'!     This compilation includes nearly all of Blur's singles released from 1990-2000, \\"This is a Low\\" (an album-exclusive track from 'Parklife'), plus a single exclusive to 'The Best of Blur': \\"Music is My Radar\\". Though the track-listing of 'The Best of Blur' does not run in a chronological order, it has been arranged to flow quite nicely from song to song. I generally prefer hits collections to have the songs ordered year-by-year. However, this particular compilation was organized so effectively that listening to it from start-to-finish seems more ideal than listening to it in any other order!     So, what singles are missing off of this collection? \\"Bang\\" (from 'Leisure'), \\"Popscene\\" (non-album single), \\"Chemical World\\" and \\"Sunday Sunday\\" (both from 'Modern Life is Rubbish'), \\"Stereotypes\\" (from 'The Great Escape), and \\"M.O.R.\\" (from 'Blur'). Because 'The Best of Blur' was released in 2000, the three singles from Blur's 2003 studio album 'Think Tank' are not included here (\\"Out of Time\\", \\"Crazy Beat\\", and \\"Good Song\\").     Buying this album ended up causing me to buy nearly all of their studio albums, since I enjoyed the songs I heard so much that I wanted to hear more! Blur had a knack for combining British sensibilities and styles with a very modern pop/rock sound in a way I haven't heard with many bands from the 1990s-2000s. It has been interesting to see members of Blur go on to do work in separate areas, especially Damon Albarn's involvement in Gorillaz and The Good,The Bad, and The Queen. Additionally, there have been rumors circulating through the music press about \\"final\\" Blur album to be released by the band sometime in the future. I've been pleased with much of what I've heard from Blur thus far, so I'd definitely be looking forward to that possibility!
B00009P1O2|5.0|Wow-- DVD at home--with Bose sound sure beats the 8 tracks and wedge speakers in my 69 Mustang.  Beats the turntable and nickles taped to the needle and giant home made speakers (thank you Radio Shack).  Always liked Queen-- this is my first Queen DVD and it is great.  Nice variety.  Freddie whips up the crowd.... goose bumps.  Program the DVD to play REPEAT.  I like this better than vinyl-- Night at the Opera.<br /><br />Another One Bites the Dust-- good for pregame in the locker room.
B000MGUZMU|4.0|The deluxe edition of Neon Bible is cool. It comes in a little box with two flip books, a separate slip for the CD, and of course, the liner notes (CD booklet).<br /><br />Concerning Neon Bible itself: I think Win Butler said it best himself: Neon Bible is best listened to at night by the ocean.  It's very very different from Funeral, their debut album. I'd say the only similarity Bible has with it's predecessor is that you still rock out, even with this new sound.  When you listen to it, don't think \\"What happened to the sound of Funeral?\\"  Different album, different sound.<br /><br />My favorite tracks from the album are \\"Ocean of Noise\\" (the words, the last few minutes - superb), \\"Intervention\\" (spine-tingling), \\"No Cars Go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Keep The Cars Running\\" is a good song too. I just wish it was longer.
1932100660|5.0|After running through my long list of health concerns, a friend recommended this book to me. If you are looking for factual information about how the American diet is directly affecting our health, you need to read this. I've bought copies for friends, and having been sharing this info as much as possible without having people think I'm nuts. But it's that important. After having cancer once, and a pre-cancer diagnosis a second time, I figured I must be doing something wrong. Dr. Campbell told me exactly what I was doing wrong, and provide excellent suggestions for improving basic health and longevity.
4770030096|3.0|These books are actually very handy learning tools. What frustrates me is how many version there are!! I got the romaji verison of volume I a few years back, but I grew frustrated with all the English characters in it. After all, the only way to practice kana is by reading it. So I recently decided to order volume I in the Kana version, but it's not even remotely the same book. How often to they change this book, like every year? It's completely different material!! It's confusing to know which workbook goes with which volume and so on and so forth. I wish this company would be more clear about all the different verison available and what goes with each volume, b/c the exercises in them are really helpful.
0307346609|5.0|Here's the deal--if you see a book or movie about zombies (especially the Romero-type zombie movies or books), you KNOW that they're for entertainment.  They're not going to win Oscars or things like that. <br /> <br />This book is a surprisingly good and quick read.  Mr. Brooks has done an excellent job, in the tradition of Studs Terkel's \\"The Good War (to which he pays tribute in his acknowledgements),\\" of writing a very plausible oral history for an implausible event. <br /> <br />The characters are well thought out, and some of the twists are surprising (a Powell/Dean Presidency?).  Each of the characters stays true to their culture and their stories flow nicely.  Mr. Brooks leaves no part of the earth unturned, even going to the international space station for one of the vignettes. <br /> <br />I bought the book on a Friday night and finished it on Monday night.  It's a quick read and the mental imagery is vivid.  You can see the characters remembering this stuff (like the beginning of the \\"Band of Brothers\\" shows), then the scene would flow into the events happening.  I'm actually disappointed they're doing a movie, I think an HBO miniseries would be a much better treatment of the storyline. <br /> <br />I've even gotten to the point where I'm thinking of writing an \\"autobiography\\" in this genre, inserting myself into the storyline as a bit player.  I'll probably work on it for the next six months or so. <br /> <br />I've been thinking of buying the Survival Guide, this book makes me want to even more now. <br /> <br />If you're looking for entertainment, give this book a read.  You'll go thru 50 pages before you set it down!
0374105235|5.0|I saw Ishmael Beah on the Daily Show and became instantly interested in his story. The book did not disappoint and while it was fairly simply written I think that that added a lot to it and made it come across as a very real, down to earth account of a horrific situation that most of the world seems to ignore.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to all!
B000N6U0DS|5.0|Outstanding!  A real life \\"Grisham\\" kind of story.  This character was taken through the ringer, and just when you know nothing else bad can happen to him, he has his breakthrough.  A tear jerker!
B0002X314C|5.0|This is one of those wonderful CDs that is a complete listening experience. Every song on the album is wonderfully written and executed, so I really enjoy it. In fact, this album is so well produced, you'd think he was a Jackson!
B000MV9026|4.0|Very entertaining with a moral at the end.  Happy feet reminded me of people I talk to and see every day. A \\"must have\\" for your dvd collection.
B000I2J79K|5.0|Talking about a great concert...this is it! Very entertaining with some old but excellent groups. A must buy! PQ and AQ is SWEET!
1582701709|5.0|This Author has taken all those sayings I have heard all my life and put them into a way of understanding HOW to use your own energy in a productive way. I am a better woman for it.. Thank you!
B000N6UERK|3.0|Mr. Washington needs to find a new story line...Deja Vu. Same old stuff!
0143036556|5.0|I liked Guns, Germs and Steel, and I thought this was also good.  It's a little more accessible (GG&S could be dense at times), but focuses only on one issue - what things (esp. environmental damage) can lead to the downfall of societies.  Definitely a good read.
B000MXPE74|5.0|If you live in the Philadelphia area, you should be familiar with WXPN, and Jim McGuinn's new show way-y-y on the left side of your radio dial. <br /> <br />Back in December, he played \\"Chelsea Knife\\", and I went nuts (and this was well before the iPod commercial that features \\"Flathead\\")wondering who the hell these guys were. <br /> <br />\\"Costello Music\\" is probably going to make my \\"Top Ten of '07\\".  <br /> <br />If you're into a bit of ska, a bit of punk, you're going to love this one!  <br /> <br />Oh, and the songwriting ain't bad, either! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CWNR|1.0|The orphanage is neat, and is portrayed in a nice, familyish way.  The care that is shown there is touching.  Beyond that, I search for someone that stands out as true, genuine, and responsible, and I don't find one.  The meaninglessness of life without God is starkly portrayed.
6305882592|5.0|I love to watch this movie when I need cheering up.  That may sound strange when you consider that death is a major theme, but Maude's love of life is so wonderfully uplifting.  The writing is witty and the acting so well done.  There are so many memorable lines.  Don't miss the trailers - the second one has a surprise.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I would have easily given it a 4.5 if only for how much I dig this band. But the half star rating does not exist in this system and therefore I went 4 instead of 5. Arcade Fire \\"Neon Bible\\" is as good as funeral in many more ways than one. This band really gets down and the members are obviously highly virtuosos (is that a word right there, what did I just do?) beginning with the lead vocals. This guy can sing so beatiful is like a magnet to the senses. Instrumentation is varied during this CD but what really gets me about this group is their ability to set a mood of brilliant design over the duration. There is something about Arcade Fire that distinguish them as a truly original act. It appears to me the band is seriously bonded in their music. Hey, it don't matter anymore where any band comes from, there are just too many great bands worldwide that is a welcome fact for the music we so much need to live and enjoy! Arcade Fire as their name implies are Hot to Trodd and it is almost my sure expectation that they will only get better, it seems to be the only way they can go. One thing is for sure, this album requires repeated listens to unveil its true potential, which is what I love the most about the best albums, the songs are not immediately appreciated. On my way to Vegas I sparked a you might know what and I listened to \\"Neon Bible\\" and I only played it half way. On the way back after loosing some money in my fool proof gambling method I played it again and it was like night and day. These band gets better after repeated listens! What a friggin voice! and the lyrics not too shabby at all! What I respect the most about Arcade Fire is their sense of melody, mama mia!! Like Bright Eyes the future of music is already here and the best of the best will always find a way to rise to the top of the heap! Only the best need to apply! 4.5 for the \\"Neon Bible\\".
B000GUJYRE|4.0|These recordings have outstanding sound quality, as other reviewers have said. None of them are less than worthwhile, and I think the rendition of the Eroica is sensational, the best I've heard. The 9th is also among the best. The 5th, though, is not in the same class. Another reviewer has commented on the tempo of the first movement, which I agree is too fast; unfortunately, so is much of the rest of the piece. (Bernstein's 1990 recording with the Vienna Philharmonic is much better.) Still, no one could fault the LSO's playing, or the sound. Worth the money for the Eroica and the 9th alone.
0316548189|5.0|There are all kinds of inspiring biographies and autobiographies.  This one is unique.  Most biographies lean toward the spiritual and base their inspiration on some divine energy or God.  This is the most grounded in life biography that you can read. Not much about God, just about his own passion for equal rights. Even mindedness, even in the face of incredible pain.
B000NA28IE|4.0|I read and liked the books okay but they weren't edited enough and become boring and the ending of Eragon was disappointing and rather anticlamatic to me.  So I wasn't expecting much from the movie and was pleasantly surprised.  It is rather short and I do see why people complain about the changes, but had I not read the book I would have liked the movie even more.  It is full of action and was entertaining and the ending was much more exciting than the book.  If you have read the book and loved it don't expect this movie to follow the story faithfully, but if you enjoy sci fi movies forget the book and enjoy the movie for itself.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|The product was received in great shape, and I play it every morning with my breakfast.  I love the girls.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|A coach who insists that his players strive at success in the classroom as well as on the basketball court. May their tribe increase! Ken Carter accepts the job as coach of the California based Richmond Oilers, an inner city high school team. He makes the students sign contracts where they agree to maintain at least a 2.3 GPA, attend classes, and sit in the front row. <br /> <br />But as good as the team is becoming on the court, they are not all living up to the bargain in the classroom, so Coach Carter cancels team practices and games until the student athletes show improvement in their studies. This gets the coach in a lot of hot water with the community.  <br /> <br />This is a hard hitting, gutsy movie that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. The movie starts to become a bit predictable by about the halfway point, but that doesn't man that the film isn't any less satisfying. <br /> <br />This is simply great film to own on dvd! Every high school basketball team should se this movie because it teaches priorities, especially the priority of education above even sports.
B00009TB5G|3.0|Well, this is by far the BEST DVD box that i ever bought, as a fan of tolkien those extra cenes just blown me away, i feel like it was a new Lord of The Rings movie.If you're a fan of Middle Earth this dvd is a \\"must have\\" in the dvd section. <br /> <br />One of the extra scenes show the relationship of Boromir and his brother Faramir back at Gondor, and what happens before Boromir travel to Rivendell to join the Council of Elrond and the Fellowship of the Ring, just stunning. <br /> <br />Buy the Return of the King and Fellowship of the ring too, you will not be dissapointed.
B000667GFK|5.0|Your collection of Luis Miguel just is not complete without this disc.  Classic and passionate Mariachi combined with that wonderful voice - my oh my!!  How can you miss?!  A great CD.  \\"Motivos\\" is my personal favorite - makes you feel the passion of first love all over again.  Of course it helps if you understand the words, but even if you don't, you can't help but fall in love with his voice and the wonderful music.<br /><br />I totally disagree with the reviewer that states that his voice is not strong enough for Mariachi Rancheras - he comes through powerfully and does not disappoint this seasoned listener of classic Mariachi.  One of my favorite collections.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is an outstanding documentary. Every man,woman and child in this <br />world should see it.  Specially every person in every government in the whole world, to create a conscience of the great danger this good earth <br />where we all live in is facing.  <br /> <br />We should all ask Mr.Al Gore to run for President again.  I am sure this <br />time around he will win.
048623231X|5.0|Book arrived in promised condition, and in a timely fashion.  I would buy from this seller again.
0679720200|4.0|To some, \\"The Stranger\\" is of the same mold as Kafka's \\"The Trial\\".  With an exestentialistic perspective, Camus tells a story that is more of a reflection of society than a true novel.  The feel that Camus strives for seems to fall short as the main character is not sympathetic.  In reality, the character just seems stupid. <br /> <br />Monseiur Meursault is not saddened when his mother dies.  This disturbs the jury just as much as the fact that he killed a man.  With no remorse or guilt, the jury sentences Meursault to death.  The main character seems maddeningly silent throughout the course of the story until his speech no longer matters.  Visited by the chaplain in prison, Meursault finally spews his sad diatribe for virtually no one to hear. <br /> <br />Just as the main character seems unable to connect with his world, I was unable to connect with the story.  I understand where Camus was leading the reader in the story, yet I feel that he did not deliver the anticipated effort in taking me to the point.
B00005QZWI|4.0|I really enjoyed the 3 series of The Lord of the Rings movie so I wanted the music.  The soundtracks are good but if you like the movie the soundtracks watch the movie.  They remind you of certain parts in the movie like the song Concerning Hobbits.  The song is whimsical. Enyna has a great voice, very haunting. The Ring Goes South is another favorite of mine. I can enjoy these soundtracks as classical or dramatic music. I bought them because I loved the Lord of the Rings which has many similarities to Braveheart. Bravery, courage, strength, honesty, selflessness, love and other good human qualities people try to attain and admire them in the people and movies they view.
1582701709|5.0|I anxiously awaited the arrival of, \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne.  It is not a long book, so I read it rather quickly.  About a week after I finished the book, I ordered the DVD and have watched it twice.  You truly have to believe in \\"The Secret\\" in order for it to work.  The book is not for skeptics. One cannot be doubtful of its power.  It is amazing how the power of thought and visualization work.  The book was ordered in the middle of March and it is now the beginning of April.  In less than 4 weeks, I have received three personal checks in the mail that I did not expect, got an order that I had placed over a month and a half ago, and received a $1000.00 check at work, totally unexpectedly, from a company that wanted to donate to an educational program I have been involved with. <br />I would highly recommend both the book and the DVD to anyone with the power to believe and who are grateful for what they have.  Good luck!
074356619X|4.0|I have enjoyed listening to these CDs, the message makes sense. <br />However, at times at times the narrator can be corny and condescending, like she's talking to a group of 5 year olds. <br />It seems that some very pertinent information has been left out of the CD's that I got by going to 'The Secret' website and listening to the speakers on the CDs expand on the subject. <br />All in all a good message that really makes you think.
032147404X|5.0|This is a perfect beginners book.  It is as if he takes you on a shoot.
1582701709|2.0|Based on the marketing blitz this book received after Oprah gave it her seal of approval,  I purchased THE SECRET thinking I might have missed something really spectacular along my path of self-discovery. Having read THE SECRET, I can personally say that I discovered the message of this book long before this book was published thanks to the works of Dr. Joseph Murphy, Wayne Dyer, Louise Hay, John Gray and many many of their contemporaries as well as my own inner teacher. If you are not well read in the works of the aforementioned authors/teachers, then you will most likely find the information contained in this book very helpful.
B00005ATQF|5.0|If you like Jar Head or Mail Call, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />It's a raw, great commentary piece on the Vietnam War, seriously a must own!!!
B000AAP7FI|4.0|This compilation appears to start out in chrono order.  Disk 4 is more big band style.  Some songs are duplicates of others on the set.  Some covers of more famous versions but mostly original.  Very low background noise.  This set lets you hear how it started out and influenced the later artists that we have now in blues/rockabilly and other genres of music.  The production isn't as good as today, but it's still worth the cost to hear what the early pioneers did with the tunes.
0553382179|5.0|Wonderful book (and website)!  Really helps you get organized, so that your home isn't so cluttered and housecleaning is a breeze.  No special insights; just lots of common sense.  Highly recommend.
0307237699|5.0|The members of \\"Turning Pages Book Club\\", were greatly impressed by this story about aspirations for  positive political cohesiveness in America. The storyline weaved historical, personal, social and group interests together while also teaching you the history behind American politics. <br />This book was both personal and educational because of Mr.Obama's excellent writing style. Which was described by the book club members as being; \\"very smooth, easy to read, while also holding your interest in a subject that is generally difficult to understand when it is being delivered verbally, let alone reading about it in a novel\\". <br />The chapters of the book identified with topics that everyone could easily relate to and be easily drawn into Mr. Obama's passion for that particular topic, weather it is about \\"Faith, Values, Opportunity, The World Beyond Borders, Family or Politics\\" to list a few of the favorite chapters. As the reader, you became so drawn into the subject matter that your passionate side over takes you and you want to help Mr. Obama find a solution for the problem or situation. <br />When you can take a stoical subject such as politics and remain  optimistic in your writings, then you are bound to draw positive responses from your reading audience. <br />Kudos, to Mr. Barack Obama, you have a very optimistic attitude and it will take you to the top of every mountain you attempt to climb, just keep climbing, you will reach the top!

0151012768|3.0|Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is an original novel. The plot revolves around an absurdist plan by a devoutly religious sheik and fishing aficonado who wants to introduce salmon into his native Yemen. He comissions Alfred Jones, a gentle mannered fisheries scientist to assist him, and the vulnerable, pretty Harriet, an administrator, to make the plan work. Salmon are a cold water fish, the chances of them surviving in a desert climate are remote. The plot sounds ludicrous - and it is. Even more so once the story swings into political satire mode when the Prime Minister, spun a merry dance by his odious Press Secretary, Peter Maxwell (anyone familiar with the 'Little Britain' comedy series - think Sebastian!), becomes involved as a means of getting positive coverage out of the region to deflect attention from the Iraq conflict.<br /><br />The story, told in fragmentary style through emails, diaries, memos and extracts from unpublished books, becomes complex, as several plots unfold involving Harriet's fiance posted on military duty in Iraq, Alfred's marriage to workaholic sourpuss Mary who is similarly on duty - to her job - for a bank in Geneva, the machinacions of political spin and Al Quaeda, who oppose the project as it is ungodly. All of this is right on the topical money. The story of Harriet's fiance, Robert, in particular has special topical relevance in light of the March 2007 hostage crisis in Iran when British servicemen were accused of straying into Iranian territory. The quality of the prose sags in places, and its tone is somewhat Pooterish in the style of those gentle oh so polite English novels of the earlier 20th Century, much satirised by Cyril Connolly. 'I was somewhat alarmed to discover that...' Elmore Leonard, this ain't. However every time I thought the plot would descent into lunacy or cliche, the narrative swoops back up with a fine stretch writing. For me the sections involving descriptions of salmon fishing, Alfred's marital communication with his estranged wife - saying much about modern professional couples, and the descriptions of the Middle East - the smells, the Muezzin call to prayer, gathered from the author's own experiences working in industry in the region, are superior to the political plot sections, which had a lot to say about the modern spin culture in politics but was fairly weak, obvious satire full of cheap jokes.<br /><br />I think the author's true strength, on this evidence, lies not in satire but in light comedy with a heartwarming message. This is achieved by the end of Salmon Fishing, which becomes a fable about the necessity of belief (carefully avoiding the sickly mawkishness of religious 'faith'). Write about you know, so the saying goes, and Paul Torday has gathered his experiences and passions, pulled them through his artistic consciousness, and produced a light, witty and original page turner.tranged wife - saying much about modern professional couples, and the descriptions of the Middle East - the smells, the Muezzin call to prayer, gathered from the author's own experiences working in industry in the region, are superior to the political plot sections, which had a lot to say about the modern spin culture in politics but was fairly weak, obvious satire full of cheap jokes.

B000FDFVZ6|4.0|I read this book about a year ago.  It was a rather beautiful story about a young girl that gets murdered and how the family copes with, first, her disappearance, and then her murder investigation. All throughout the book the young girl looks down at the life of her family from her heaven. I think this book was well written and offered the reader a fresh and different perspective of heaven than I had ever heard of. It was easy for me to get into the story, and I even to related to the characters well. However, at the end of this book I was slightly disappointed. I felt like something was left unresolved in the story. Nonetheless, that doesn't stop me from considering this a very good book.
B0000020C4|5.0|The first time I ever heard Les Miserables, it was on the Original Broadway cast CD.  That CD had great vocals, but I didn't realize how much I was missing until I saw the show in NYC.  What sets this recording apart from many others, including the OBC version, is the fact that, like the musical, it is through-sung.  The complete symphonic recording is also this way, and has all of the music.  Although this CD is lacking a few parts, most noticibly a shortend Lovely Ladies, missing a section with Javert, and Gavroche's death, when looked at in terms of the completeness and vocal abilities, this is the best.   <br /> <br />Regarding the cast, Colm Wilkinson is THE Valjean.  I love his vocals and the expression he puts into the character.  Armstrong, as Therniere, is great, as is Jenny Galloway (Mme Therniere).  They are both great actors and convey the comedic nature of the parts well.  Hannah Chick, as young Cosette is splendid, especially in the fact that she sings right through the accidental gun shot noise in the middle of her song.  Gavroche is priceless.  The best I've ever heard.  Ruthie Henshall does an absolutely brilliant Fantine, incredibly moving.  Michael Ball (Marius) also has the supberb vocal ability and expression so prevolent in this cast.   <br /> <br />Now, my two favorite characters, Javert and Eponine...Phillip Quast (Javert) is practically flawless.  I personally don't like his interpretation of the prologue, but that's just me.  Other than that, perfect.  He more than makes up for that with his rendition of Stars, and his soliliquy in which he dies.  You can visualize him going mad and jumping from the bridge just from his voice...amazing.  Lea Salonga's vocal ability is unmatched.  Her rendition of A Little Fall of Rain is tearjerking, and you can fell Eponine's pain and anguish throughout the entire CD.  Anything with her in it is worth buying.   <br /> <br />Finally, this CD has a recording of One Day More sung by the Valjeans from all overthe world...amazing to hear.   <br /> <br />To conclude, this is the best recording of Les Miserables you can buy.

B00008DDSC|5.0|This is a movie that is not for everyone. It is rich in emotions and goes way beyound some people's comfort levels. But I enjoyed it because there was a such an amazing finale that shouted originality. The 2 stars are perfect together and you totally want them to end up together. Maggie takes a job as a secretary- she has extreme self esteem problems and was just released from an institution. She starts working for Spader and he goes completely nuts when she makes even the most trivial mistakes and starts his own form of wierd erotic punishment. Most people would freak out but she starts to want it- and thus we have the start of a beautiful relationship full of wierdness. This is a love story and it is one of my faves because it is just soo different and lovely.<br /><br />If you are a fan of James Spader then you should totally see this, and if you haven't seen Maggie Gyllenhaal you NEED to see this. I left this movie wanting to see it again and again.

The only bad thing about it (at least for me) was that I thought all the discs had Spanish subtitles and that was why I bought it, but then when it arrived home, I noticed that only the movies had the subtitles, the other discs with all the bonus features didn't. <br /> <br />I think Amazon should specify which discs have subtitles and which discs don't, so we -all the customers- know what we are going to get. Is it so difficult to write something like: AVAILABLE SUBTITLES: English, Spanish and French (only in discs 1, 3, 5, and 7).

0743277708|5.0|I picked up this book after finishing Tolkien in a state of looking for something to read. None of the trite fantasies available at the time would do, and I was skeptical when my father recommended a book about rabbits, but I was not let down. Watership Down is an incredible piece of literature that will have you staying up until dawn, no matter what your age. The odyssey of the main characters is a fascinating journey with a rabbit's idea of utopia at the end, kept alive with brilliant animorphing of hares and other creatures along the way. Excellent beckground, personification, and storytelling make this title shine. And unlike many modern YA and fantasy writers, Adams knew when to stop. Too much of a good thing can be the death knoll to an author's work. The lack of a sequel does not stop readers from looking back on this work throughout their lives, and most will probably read it several times through.<br /><br />J.

B000FIMG68|5.0|I'm a latecomer to Lost - I discovered it early in the 3rd season, after my son bought me the first season DVDs for my birthday. I generally watch very little television -- the Daily Show and Colbert, and the occasional SNL are about the sum of it. That is, until I discovered \\"Lost.\\"  It is brilliant and gripping and fun...with a level of complexity and creative intelligence that rivals a great modern novel. Oh, sure, there are some facile elements, some convenient coincidences that will raise the occasional eyebrow. But for TV -- this is as good as it gets. Now, regarding the 2nd season per se: a few have complained that it's too complex. Some have complained that it doesn't have the quality and cohesion of the 1st season.  I utterly disagee -- the 2nd season is taut, fascinating, exciting, and completely coherent, IMO.  The \\"Hatch\\" story line was totally absorbing, and the character development proceeds apace, throughout the season.  I do think it's easier to take in the 2nd season on DVD, as opposed to watching one show per week. It's more gratifying, that way, too. So buy this collection. You will be glad you did, whether you're seeing it for the first time, or reviewing, or catching up, or \\"hunting for Easter Eggs.\\"  And if you have a family to watch it with, make it a bonding experience with them. I've watched all of \\"Lost\\" with my wife and kids. We've had a great time with it. <br /> <br />One note of warning: always \\"Lost\\" episodes in order! And certainly, watch the first season before purchasing this set.

B00005JPMX|4.0|The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came to huge national prominence during my early teenage years and my youngest brother was a huge fan of the original cartoon series.  Therefore, I won't deny that part of my attachment for the Turtles is rooted in nostalgia and sentimentality.  However, the concept of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a very interesting one and is full of ripe movie making possibilities.<br /><br />Attempting to pacify fans of all the various incarnations of the Turtles (comics, original cartoons, live action films, new cartoon series), TMNT incorporates CGI action more similar to the new animated series.  However, the storyline of the film begins approximately a year after the events in the live action film TEENAGE MUTANT TURTLES III.<br /><br />Since once again defeating Shredder and traveling through time, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have returned to a New York City that isn't as violent and crime-ridden as it used to be.  For all intents and purposes the Foot has been disbanded and violent crime in the city has dramatically dropped.  In short, the city doesn't seem to have any use for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right now.  Their sensei and father, the giant rat Splinter, knows that the current peace that pervades the city will not last.  The Turtles seem to be growing apart and perhaps sensing his own mortality, Splinter wants the Turtles to work and fight together as a unified team and become a true family.  Therefore, he sends Leonardo to South America to train and become a better leader.  The brothers miss Leo, but they move on:  Michelangelo works as a children's party attraction, Donatello has started a tech-support business, and Raphael, unbeknownst to his family, prowls the night as the hooded vigilante Knightwatcher.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a cosmic alignment is on the verge of occurring for the first time in 3,000 years and seems connected to the appearance of various giant monsters appearing in and around the city.  There's also the sudden revival of the Foot clan.  Through their connection with April O'Neil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Casey Jones (Chris Evans), who now are dating, the Turtles learn that the events are all connected to the philanthropic billionaire Max Winters (Patrick Stewart).  With the help of O'Neil and Jones the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have to figure out what the connection between Winters, the Foot, the monsters, and the stone warriors is and in the process save the city from destruction on an apocalyptic scale.<br /><br />As far as CGI animated films go, TMNT is pretty good.  Freed from the constraints of live action animatronics or costumed people, TMNT tells a much more action oriented story.  The animation is vivid and sleek, but has an overall visually dark tone reminiscent of the original Turtle comics.  The storyline of the film combines elements of both historical fantasy and science fiction and successfully connects the stories of the live-action Teenage Turtle Ninja Turtles movies to the newer animated series.  Some might find the general plot a bit unwieldy, but for anyone who grew up with the Turtles, the plot doesn't seem all that far-fetched and actually is more grounded than some other turtle stories (TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES III anyone?).<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed TMNT.  I thought the filmmakers did an excellent job of tying together all the different strands of Turtle canon that not only unites it in a coherent film, but also makes a good movie that appeals both to fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the general public.  I especially liked seeing the action sequences where the Turtles, Casey Jones, April, and Splinter fight together.  Seeing Splinter in action reminded me of seeing Yoda fight for the first time in ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  I also liked how April wasn't as prissy as she was presented to be in the first live action Turtle films; she's not afraid to fight in this movie and brings an additional asset to the team instead of a liability.  The movie also has a great soundtrack and score.  Highly recommended for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fans, but also has appeal to anyone who enjoys well developed animated films.<br /><br />As an extra, listen for Kevin Smith as the voice of a Diner.  It's one of the few PG rated performances he's ever given on film.am instead of a liability.  The movie also has a great soundtrack and score.

B000AP04FG|3.0|As far as movies go, MR. AND MRS. SMITH is essentially an action movie containing a snippet of intrigue. However, sentiment for the film will remain high because MR. AND MRS. SMITH will always be looked upon as the film that brought stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together (despite having probably been involved together before working on the production). The film opens with John and Jane Smith (Pitt and Jolie) discussing their life together and looking back on the rather bored domesticity they shared in the early years of their marriage. Originally they found each other attractive and compatible. But, more importantly, the marriage was a convenience for both John and Jane are top international assassins. Their relationship enters completely different territory when both John and Jane are both sent to assassinate the same target. They end up getting in each others' way and the man they were sent to assassinate gets away. They vow to get rid of the other assassin. Upon discovering that they are trying to kill each other, John and Jane have to decide whether the love they have for each other is real and worth fighting for or to keep fighting until they kill each other.<br /><br />MR. AND MRS. SMITH is slightly better than the usual action flick. Much of this is because of the film's stars. As much as I hate to admit it, Brad Pitt is a decent actor and Angelina Jolie is not a terrible actress. They are both known more for their looks than their talent, but unlike many of the pretty faces that show up in movies they have some acting chops. However, looks and talent aside, the real reason that MR.AND MRS. SMITH stands out from other similar action movies is because of the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie. The weakest scenes in the movie are when their characters try to prevent each other from finding out what they really do for a living and when each of their characters &#34;struggles&#34; with how they feel for each other. They like each other. They like each other a lot and their passion is white smoking hot.<br /><br />Not being a fan of either Pitt or Jolie, MR. AND MRS. SMITH wasn't a film I was very excited to watch. I will admit that it was slightly better than I thought it would be. The story isn't especially strong and there are some scenes that make many James Bond films seem plausible and realistic. The acting is much better than in many action flicks. I especially enjoyed Vince Vaughn's supporting role as one of John's co-workers, Eddie. Even though I know most will be drawn to the film because of either Pitt or Jolie or both, I was more impressed with the secondary actors in the film. Unfortunately, they receive very little screen time at all. Highly recommended for fans of Pitt and Jolie. If you just enjoy watching action films, you could do better, but you could also do much worse.lot and their passion is white smoking hot.<br /><br />Not being a fan of either Pitt or Jolie, MR.

The soft, upbeat songs like \\"Pieces of Eight\\", \\"I'm O.K.\\", and \\"Lords of the Ring\\" are contradicted perfectly with the heavy songs like \\"Blue Collar Man\\", \\"Queen of Spades\\", and \\"Renegade\\" (which is one of my favorite songs of all time).

B000NGV9EW|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith's \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" is an entrancing work of fiction. Smith's lively prose and witty humour is set in a rich backdrop of exotic Gaborone and the Kalahari, replete with witchcraft and crocodiles, missing daughters and philandering husbands all flowing to the rhythms of Botswanan life. But the most endearing is the character of generously proportioned Precious Ramotswe, of traditional build as she puts it. Mma Ramotswe is human in her uncertainties and self-doubts and has a background and skills quite unlike any other fictional detective. She isn't Miss Marple, but her canny intuition, warmth and unreserved wit has created a character which already has contributed more to tourism in Botswana than the tourism promotion efforts of the local government.<br /><br />When her father dies, Precious Ramotswe sells the hundred and eighty cattle she inherits and sets up as Botswana's only female private detective. The beginning is tough but as she solves her cases in her own unique manner, her reputation spreads and cases start coming in. There's no single big mystery that runs throughout the book, but rather a variety of small cases: a wayward teenager daughter, a missing husband, a strangely behaving doctor and a kidnapped boy. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is the first of eight books about Mma Ramotswe.<br /><br />Greatly recommended reading for its heart-warming quality and natural wisdom.

B000002UYZ|5.0|Some great early hits and of course a fine cd, afterall it is the Beatles
B0002S947K|5.0|Great songwriter and music!  If you have a soul you will like this CD.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|The CD is fantastic.  I wish it had been released shortly after the concert.  We should not had to wait this long.  However, the DVD is poor.  There are some interesting clips but the picture is grainy and there are only pictures of a reel to reel tape deck for much of the production.
1582701709|2.0|I can't believe the popularity of this book.  Let's first set aside the ridiculous notion that we can all control the universe.  If we could all control the universe, it would be chaos.  When you boil the notions of the book down, it has a few very simple messages. Think positive, do what you should do, visualize your dreams.  HEY RHONDA!  That's no secret - its been rehashed by every self help author for over 100 years.  For you to take credit for it is just silly.
B000002UAO|5.0|This has been my favorite Beatles cd since the 60's and nothing has changed.  What an incredible set of music.
B00008MJ33|4.0|I am not a very erudite reviewer of movies. I know however how highly praised this film is . I can understand why. Great music, and an amusing drama in which Envy plays a central role. The much wiser and worldly Salieri envies the dumb Mozart who produces works of genius that Salieri cannot. Salieri's intriguing and betrayal , his angry passion are at the heart of the story.<br /><br />I however watched the film wanting and waiting to understand where Mozart's genius comes from, and how it works. The point or one point of the film is that it is 'dumb genius' entirely.<br /><br />This is not true to Mozart's life as we know it. And in this I found the film wanting.
B000JJRIO8|3.0|Well its certainly better than that \\"Loyal To The Game\\" episode, though its a very mixed bag. Tracks like the lead single \\"Pac's Life\\" are pure garbage. However tracks like \\"Dumpin\\", \\"Playa Cardz Right\\", \\"Don't Sleep\\" and Soon As I Get Home (The only original on the album) are well worth listening to. Though i do hope the soundtrack for the upcoming movie coming out that Pac wrote in jail, will be the last as Pac's legacy is starting to get pretty greedy. <br /> <br />R.I.P. Tupac Amaru Shakur
B00005JPCF|3.0|I could hardly wait for this DVD as I do not go to the movies. I was expecting a nothing but Happy movie - this was no Shreik- I think a movie geared tward Childen should be nothing but happy sillyness- leave the moral messages to Al Gore, I actually found the movie more sad than Happy, yes there are some great scenes which made me smile but too many hidden messages which probably went over most little kids heads. Some I hope did. Too deep to be a fun movie for me. Bring back funny goofy kids movies like Toy Story or Shreik.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|Everyone in the world owned a vinyl copy of this album once it hit big. At the time I thought it was a tad over rated and of course you couldn't escape MJ or his videos and Thriller is the opitime of how music was forever changed by MTV - not only did his videos sell the album, they were able to launch a total of 7 singles off of one 9 song album, unheard of at the time. When someone becomes huge and overplayed, I usually lose interest quite fast and instead of the popular songs find myself going towards the lesser known tracks. At the time Thriller broke my favorite song was actually \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" but now listening to the song, the lyrics are quite awful but the beat, oh yes that beat is still golden. My copy of Thriller is the awesome remastered special additon with bonus cuts and audio about the songs by producers and arranagers, so it's really quite interesting. But it all boils down to the music itself and I must admit twenty some odd years later I am impressed with the album. I love the singles with equal passion - \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Human Nature\\" (my current fav), \\"PYT\\", \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" with Paul McCartney(which is a song I used to loathe but now isn't quite as bad - though I still cringe when they talk to each other at the end, \\"oh paul I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter\\" umm okay Mikey) and the title track which you would think sounds like a dated piece of cheese but amazingly enough it's a very entertaining song. There's still the question as to why this of all the albums released at the time is the best selling album (or close to the best selling album) of all time, but it is a fun piece of music though it's a tad sad to think about what Mr. Jackson has done to himself in recent years. You just have to forget all that and look at the cover of what he used to be and hear the songs. Though once again I question who this damn Billie Jean is, if you recall she shows up in \\"Wanna Be...\\" as well. He really had it in for this girl.For the record, I always knew he wasn't the father of her baby, I had no doubt. In fact I have severe doubts he's the father of the kids he dangles off of balconies as well. <br />
B00005JPPL|1.0|This movie isn't even out yet and already I'm sick.  I am a big fan of Philip K Dick, I've read almost everything that has been published, and I cannot believe what people do to his work.  The only \\"adaptation\\" that was of any value was \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", and I don't understand why it was made into animation.  It did nothing for the story.  Now we have another story \\"based on\\" a PKD story that has nothing to do with the original.  If you want to know what this story is about, read \\"The Golden Man\\", and forget the movie.  In fact I recommend the short story collection entitled \\"Second Variety\\" by Citadel Press.  While you are at it, read Dick's comments on the story \\"The Golden Man\\" in the Notes at the back. It is a better use of your time than going to see the evisceration of another one of his excellent stories.  I wonder where Dante would put the \\"writer\\" who adapted this one?
B00005AQGH|5.0|It does seem more of a compilation than an album to me. It basically has songs for everything he had done in his career so far, for introspective we have \\"Krazy\\" and \\"Hold Ya Head\\", for political we have \\"White Man'z World\\", for outlaw we have \\"Life Of An Outlaw, for diss songs we have \\"Bomb First\\" and \\"Against All Odds\\" and so on. All in all its a classic album  though ranks as my third favourite (behind Me Against The World and All Eyez on Me) The production shines once again and Pac never dissapoints. Highly recommended to all Pac fans who don't already own this
0399230033|5.0|My students love this book and it is useful for so many goals, I actually purchased a second copy when I couldn't find the first this fall.  Now I have two copies and my student get really, really excited when they notice there are two gorilla books. <br /> <br />The version I have is a lap edition, board book, which is extremely sturdy and large enough to read to multiple students. <br /> <br />This is a book with humorous elements, repetitive themes, and so many ways to creatively explore.  One thing small children enjoy so much is voices.  When all the animals chime in with their \\"good night\\", each one can have its own voice.  <br /> <br />I, too, add this to a baby shower or new baby gift.  It is so versatile that it is a book that can be read to a small baby through kindergarten.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I leanded how to pilot a plane at Hemet Ryan Field in Hemet, CA and I know that the PBY in this film belonged to Venable Flying Serive and that MAKES this film more special to me than anything........
B000MGUZMU|4.0|This is the second album I bought from these artists and although it is not The Funeral, which happen to be, I think, there best work, it is just as original, just well crafted and arranged.  There are not that mann bands with that many members that can put music together like the Arcade Fire.
B000005Z0G|4.0|But still not on classic level. On the lyrical side Pac spits flames throughout the album. But for me it doesn't match up to other albums such as Me Against The World and of course All Eyez On Me. So it gets a 4 stars, meaning its well worth listening to.    The album kicks off with the venomous \\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\\" Pac gives 3 verses of pure fire with a very hypeful beat. \\"Pac's Theme\\" is an interlude with Tupac responding to then vice president \\"Dan Qualye\\". \\"Point Tha Finga\\" is more fire. Pac hits hard about the media and other things. I Love \\"Something 2 Die 4\\" its definitely my favourite interlude ever. Pac talks in his soulja's voice over a very relaxing beat. \\"Last Wordz\\" keeps the venom going but this time he collabrates with none other than Ice-T and Ice Cube. All of them drop excellent verses. \\"Souljah's  Revenge\\" is another of my favourites with more of Pac's soulja voice. \\"Peep Game\\" has a very interesting beat with a nice guest appearance. \\"Strugglin\\" featured mostly the live squad and most of them did a good job (though certainly not spitting on par with Pac) \\"Guess Who's Back\\" is similiar though a solo with only 2 verses. \\"Representin 93 is another standout which should have been a single. \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" is the best on the album hands down! One of Pac's most brilliant recordings ever. \\"Strictly 4 my niggaz\\" was a very long song with a kind of a darkish beat and hook. \\"The Streetz Of Death Row\\" definitely should have been a single. Pac spits 3 verses of pure fire about the streetz. \\"I Get Around\\" takes us to Pac's play full side. With a nice laidback beat Pac and The Digital Underground spit some nice verses about having fun. \\"Papa'z Song\\" is another venomous song. Pac talks about fathers leaving their children. \\"5 Deadly Venomz\\" is a magnificient way to end the album. The beat is full of hype and and Pac and The Live Squad again hit hard.
6305181810|5.0|I will not dwell on the details of this John Grisham story that puts the insurance industry on trial.  The purpose of my comments are to let Amazon viewers know that Paramount has set July 24, 2007 for release of this wonderful movie as an anamorphic Special Collectors Edition.  For those of you contemplating buying this DVD, wait until July for a nicer version without those black bars.  I hope this is of help to my fellow Amazon viewers.
1582701709|5.0|I've read \\"The Secret\\" several times and each time, I take away something new. It's inspiring, it's full of hope, and yet it seems timeless. Like something you've heard all your life but never paid much attention to. I would suggest that anyone, looking for something to get them going, take-up this book and delve deep within its pages. If, like me, you find it too simplistic, I suggest you read it several more times to grasp the true meaning. This IS your life and you DO have control over it. I'm still struggling, to put the full concept into play, but have faith I'll be successful. And, in the end, isn't that what we all strive for...success? Put any name you want on it...hopes, dreams, achievements, pie-in-the-sky...whatever...success is exactly what it truly is.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I purchased this product since I do love all things Final Fantasy. Yes, the Movie remains the same but the extras are things that most serious colectors should not do without. The anime feature \\"Last Order\\" is one of the main reasons that I picked this up as it explains a lot about Cloud's past. The overall presentation of the box set is beautiful. 5 stars for the FF fanatic and 3 for the casual fan.
B000005Z0E|4.0|Unlike Snoop Dogg, Biggie, Nas etc, it took Pac 2 albums to get to classic. But this album is still a good effort. While production lacks a fare bit on most tracks, Pac's very intelligent rhyming and story telling make this well worth listening to. Its certainly alot different to his others but i still recommend it well. It is unfortunate that like \\"The Main Man\\" said, it wasn't appreciated until years after his sad passing.    Top 5  1. Brenda's Got A Baby - Another of Pac's very heartfelt tracks, whether based on a true story or not its an excellent song  2. Soulja's Story - Very good storytelling  3. Words Of Wisdom - A decent beat with very political lyrics  4. If My Homie Calls - best beat on the album  5. Violent - like soulja's story, Pac tells a creepy story about police brutality
0740748475|5.0|This is the ultimate collection.  Very funny and lots of fun for kids age 8 through 108.  Definately something for those Calvin & Hobbs fans in your household.
074327931X|5.0|I love this book, very transparent and organized by topic sections. First, you have to answer three to four questions, and the solution with detailed explanation is just two pages ahead. I really like it, it's a lot easier to begin to study with, than for example official guide or Princeton review which I consider more as a drill where questions are not as neatly organized as here(it's more test like)...Hope this helps!
0753820250|5.0|My heart broke turning the last page and knowing I would never see the characters again that I had grown to love and cherish.  A must read.
0743289684|4.0|I'd give it five stars but I feel like that should be reserved for the greatest book I'll ever read (whatever that might be).  This book surprised me: I'm an older man and I didn't think that this story from a young African woman would interest me that much. But it was easy to read, always interesting, and pulled me through it in just a couple of evenings. I read it to try to get more understanding of Muslim ways.  I not only got that out of it but also got as interested in this woman's story as if it had been an action novel.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a super writer who can not only tell a story but also inject humor, slang, and enough human interest so that I felt like I'd gotten to know a new friend.
B00008972S|5.0|I was present at the cast and crew reunion around 2002.  I believe it was just about Robert Wise's last appearance.  Rita Moreno was just as vibrant as she was forty years ago and it was found seeing surviving cast members tell their stories. <br />But I digress from the actual product itself.  Great transfer, I loved this movie as a boy and worshiped Natalie Wood as Maria.  I loved hearing her actual voice trying to sing those songs, with a Puerto Rican accent, no less, which the dubbed voice did not have.   <br />But this never was a realistic protrayal of street gangs either.  Real life is so much more unfair, violent and downright nasty.  It was brave enough to have the race card played, three deaths, the last a cold blooded murder and an attempted rape of an Hispanic. <br />Bernstein and Sondheim made a great team and Jerold Robbins and Wise made a masterpiece.  One of those rare moments when everything came together just right. The \\"America\\" is one of my favorite sequences but it all works for me. <br />Just one more brief musing.  I saw \\"The Searchers\\" after I saw \\"West Side Story\\".  I do remember as a boy seeing Wayne about to shoot Natalie Wood and I yelled at the screen \\"Oh my God, don't shoot Maria\\". <br /> <br />\\"I just kissed a girl named Maria....\\"
B000005RST|5.0|I had the original version and it was my second favorite Enigma CD (\\"The Screen Behind the Mirror\\" being number one).  But with the remixes, this vaults to the top.  I cannot take it out of my CD player!  I cannot explain how much I love this music; I love(d) rap, but it has gotten far too commercial and obnoxious for my taste, while pop/rock/soul has done nothing for me lately either.  This music seems made for me.  I can listen to it no matter my mood.  I've read reviews from people who were disappointed by some Enigma offerings; you're not going to see that here.  This stuff is on the same level as early 80s Prince -- absolute genius, as far as I'm concerned.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|Too much violence in a movie with good actors and a working plot.
B000JBWWRY|3.0|Peter Pan and old time classic... I saw this movie with my wife and grand children and one of the childrens name is Wendy which made the movie very special. Love captain hook and the crocodile... the graphics we have today spoils a person and the graphics in this movie is disappointing, but the story line remains great... the games are ... so, so... overall slightly above average satisfaction.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Seven Samurai is one of the best films ever made.  I've seen it several times and get a new insight each time.  A new insight I had is the famous last battle the viewer actually does not see most of the bandits getting killed.  A parade of empty horses convey that when they pass the three surviving samurai.  The commentaries are very well done and you have to be a total geek to hear Kurosawa speak for ninty minutes in Japanese (not my language, also I'm white).  However, he covers just about every main topic that I'd associate with him.  I truly found his talk about surviving World War Two and discussion of Dostoevsky just fascinating. <br />There's also a good overview of Japanese samurai films.  I had a lot of fun with this.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I doubt I would watch this film more than once, but it's one of the best acted films I've seen.  The cuts between scenes are rough and didn't play well at all on my MacIntosh.  At points, I had to use the menu and just play scene-by-scene.  The documentary portion of the set is very interesting, but I do not believe that any of the deleted scenes would have made a better film.
6305327084|5.0|One of the best and a collectible & worth watching the movie for just this part <br />\\"Supermodels are beautiful girls, Will. A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, like you've been drinking Jack and Coke all morning. Se can make you feel high with the single greatest commodity known to man--promise. Promise of a better day. Promise of a greater hope. Promise of a new tomorrow. This particular aura can be found in the gaze of a beautiful girl. In her smile, in her soul, how she makes every rotten little thing about life seem like it's going to be okay. The supermodels are bottled promise. A beautiful girl is all powerful, and that's as good as love\\"
B000MXPE7O|5.0|If you love movies involving stealthy government mumbo jumbo then this movie is definitely for you. I think Matt Damon did an excellent job playing the part that he did.<br /><br />I must say though that my girlfriend thought the movie was a bit slow. I have heard the same from a couple other people as well. To me it stayed interesting through out the entire movie though. I would easily recommend this to anyone into conspiracy theories and CIA movies.
B000OY8NII|4.0|I liked Eureka, the series that premeired on Sci-Fi last summer.  It was a very refreshing look at super-geniuses and their special problems that they face while hiding from the world at large. Colin Ferguson plays the now Sheriff Jack Carter, of the wonder-town who looks at these eccentrics with a cocked-eye and tongue firmly in cheek humor but who realizes that they must have their freedom to conduct their sometimes planetary projects.  The show is blessed with a solid cast that has only tapped into what they can achieve. While Carter views their 'eccentricies' wide-eyed, I wonder how long that will continue. They also need to create a good adversary for him, along with problems that could confront super geniuses. So far the problems they have dealt with have been X-Files like in concept and the show needs to develop problems that would humble super geniuses.  That doesn't mean it isn't a good show, it needs a storyline to follow through now.
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is Africa.    Every time something of value has been discovered in Africa, the people have suffered.  That includes ivory, rubber, gold--and now, diamonds.      This is Africa.     Press gangs of rebels conscripting men at gunpoint, taking them away from their families and forcing them to work mining for diamonds.     Rebels handing guns to young children and turning them into soldiers.      Young women selling their bodies on the street assuring the customer they are free of HIV.      Diamonds being sold by rebels to finance wars to overturn the government.     The governments only staying in power long enough to rob the treasuries and then going into exile elsewhere.      Mercenaries playing both sides of the fence.      Diamond companies tacitly financing the war by buying 'blood diamonds' from rebels, then storing the diamonds to limit their supply so their profits are still high.     This is not just the story of one mercenary and Sierra Leone native's quest to retrieve and sell a large carat pink diamond.  It's the history of a country.      The story's hard to watch, but very real and worthwhile.  James Newton Howard does an amazing job with the soundtrack, which touches the scene in just the right way to emphasize the director's point.
0399208534|5.0|This has been THE favorite book of each one of our children, beginning with our son when this book was published and is now with our third child who is a year old. The story is simple and real. The artwork is amazing to look at, and the little holes the catepillar makes in the pages while eating are fun for a little one to put their fingers on and feel. When we bought the book for our oldest in 1994, the book we bought came with a stuffed version of the catepillar that was about 8 inches long and was the favorite toy of our son's for some time until it was lost. This is an item I have had a hard time replacing as we have reintroduced this book to our youngest and is our second copy purchased for our middle daughter after our son wore out the first. We have many other Eric Carle books, but this is the most beloved.
B000FA57RG|5.0|On this CD/DVD combo there is a hidden treasure.  A treasure that I feel is worth the price alone.  Madonna pays tribute to a beautiful song, sung as only she can.  Prefaced by the comment that we all need to try to make a better world, Madonna does a wonderful rendition of John Lennon's timeless \\"Imagine\\".  A song so suited for Madonna and what I feel she attempts to stive for...  making the world better. <br /> <br />I recommend this for that song alone.  Everything else is Madonna standard fair.  Top notch sound quality and food for thought.
0802136834|4.0|Very informative, sometimes a bit wordy but its vey hard to give the details of certain events without explaining what occurances led up to the fact so well worth the read.
B000LE1FAY|3.0|I was excited for another record from one of my favorites from the past.  However, Belinda's sultry voice is best showcased on english tunes. Romance, Parisan flair, and sensuality were all but lost.  Quel dommage. A bit disappointing, but saved by \\"I Love Him\\", \\"La Vie En Rose (english version)\\" and some jazzed up acoustics.
B000GPIPTW|5.0|I collect Beach Boys & this is just another example of the best album The Beach Boys ever put to wax. After they released the CD the first time it contained the mono/stereo versions (which I prefer the mono) with a bonus track. Then a box set devoted to the album. Now they release it like the single CD but, with a DVD to further cement this album as one of the best ever released. I highly recommend this one if your looking to check out what the fuss is all about. Search \\"Judemac Forever\\" on msn.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|First off, the sound and video quality on this collection are first rate.  Madonna definitely puts on one of her most rememberable performances.  I tend to not be shocked by much these days in terms of music.  But this concert is beautiful.  I have watched this over and over about 5 different times and cannot get over the sound quality of this DVD/CD combo.  I won't detail my favorites, but there are many.  Madonna revamps \\"Like A Virgin\\" in this concert with guitar riffs that really update this song into something worthy of a current release.  It sure would fit in on today's radio.  Madonna looks great and the images provided throughout are simply breathtaking.  I would recommend buying this for the \\"Live To Tell\\" performance alone.  She, once again, shows us all how 1 can affect many.  Not just music, but lessons.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00005JLR2|4.0|What a wonderful twist on the classic Treasure Island. Silver is a cyborg and young Jim is a typical teen looking to find his place. Morph is a wonderful addition and will grab you and pull you into the adventure and fun.
0743496728|4.0|I love Jodi Picoult and I have read all of her books. \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" was just too much like \\"The Pact\\" and \\"Tenth Circle\\": troubled teens, protecting secrets, lots of angst. Her best by far is \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" in which the characters, also teens, are more developed and have lots of soul. I'll keep reading Picoult, though, because I like her style and the plots that inevitably twist at the end.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|i owned thir previous cd and concert dvd and this one is as good or better,no complaints and will buy their next one when it comes out as well !
1569242739|5.0|I look through this book several times a day just to dream about all the different lovely cup cakes. So far I've only made the Coconut cupcakes with Lime icing but they were enough to make me want to make every one in the book.  My non-vegan family were too busy asking for seconds to ask about what was in them instead of milk and eggs.  I can't recommend this book enough to anyone, vegans, vegetarians, the lactose intolerant, milk protein allergies, egg problems or even if you can eat every food in the world, you want this book. I hope they come out with a sequel! Until then, I'll be baking.
0142404128|4.0|A Must have especially if you have the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Not a funny or as long as its prequel but a classic in its own right.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Ordered as a gift. Shipped immediately. Received sooner than expected. <br />Excellent service.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|i owned thir previous cd and concert dvd and this one is as good or better,no complaints and will buy their next one when it comes out as well !
B000002HRE|5.0|Load is my favorite Metallica album, and Reload, its cousin, is almost just as good.  I play this one almost as much as Load, and it contains some of Metallica's greatest songs.  The opener, Fuel, is a scorcher, and I love The Memory Remains.  Marianne Faithful's vocal really does add to the song.  The Unforgiven II is better than the original, with some of the most moving, powerful lyrics of Hetfield's career.  The closer, Fixxxer, is another great Metallica epic, but the song I deeply admire here is Low Man's Lyric.  It's the most moving, haunting song Metallica has ever recorded, with the hurdy gurdy giving the song an immense amount of depth that most rock stars wish they had.  Hetfield's lyrics here are as good as anything he's ever written, and the song is a true classic which deserves to be better known.  For those who condemn this album as some sort of \\"sellout\\", screw off.  I find it ridiculous when people want the Metallica of old, the Kill 'em All Metallica.  That Metallica is gone.  The band has grown up.  We should admire Metallica for doing things their way, just like many great artists have done before them and after them.  When they did \\"go back\\" to their thrash roots with St. Anger, it was pretty much a disaster.  That album isn't as awful as many think it is (there are a few good songs there), but it pissed off those very fans that it was supposed to please.  Metallica should keep expanding their sound.  The fact that they're still going when other bands from the 1990's have gone away is something they should be proud of.  Metallica rules, and all their albums (even Anger) have something worthwhile in them.  This is one of their best, period...
B000LC55F2|3.0|Ok movie - a little slow to start but it opens up to be quite interesting.
B000FOQ1EA|2.0|Caveats first:  I've only heard the Fourth and Fifth from this cycle, and I disqualify myself from commenting on the Fourth because frankly I've just never understood the piece.  Suffice to say that Blomstedt & co. didn't help me come to terms with it, whether through their fault or mine.<br /><br />That said, the Fifth here is really just terrible, and a disservice to one of the great achievements in the history of music.  Don't get me wrong, the SFSO is a terrific band, and all the notes are there if that's enough for you, but I came away wondering if they had rehearsed this symphony before recording.  The players are constantly disagreeing among themselves as to note lengths, articulations, and the dynamic contour of longer notes.  Listen to the different wind soloists in the opening, for example, or to the \\"wgwgwg\\" of the violas at the start of the finale versus the \\"tktktk\\" of the violins that follow.  Rhythms are pretty much accurate, but not clearly enough delineated, and some of Sibelius's accents are completely missing.  The result is that Sibelius's stark gestures and clear structures are rendered wooly, his crystalline textures opaque.  Compare the playing of the Philharmonia with Ashkenazy (also on Decca); whether or not you agree with the tempos, and I don't always, in terms of attention to detail and unity of purpose there is no comparison.<br /><br />Blomstedt's tempos are unobjectionable, I suppose, but the \\"Andante mosso, quasi allegretto\\" feels rushed and lacks charm, especially at the beginning; and the closing pages of the symphony, which should be a thrilling, searing, devastating experience, instead induce a shrug of the shoulders.<br /><br />The Ashkenazy I mentioned is available as a set, with tone poems & violin concerto tossed in, [[ASIN:B00008CLIG here]], or slightly cheaper (w/o the violin cto) as two separate \\"2fer\\" issues; the 5th is [[ASIN:B0000042GW here]].  If you like your Sibelius more sedate there's Colin Davis & Boston on Philips, which last I checked was also available as two 2fers.  Spend the extra five bucks.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I didn't realize how much of the Video would be Indian music, but was pleasantly surprised. I found myself enjoying the rhythms and flowing melodys. It touched me to here Ravi express his feelings for George. The best surprise was Anoushka Shankar's solo, I didn't know anything about her, but she blew me away, what a talent. I was so impressed that I am attending an upcoming concert of Ravi and Anoushka.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I first saw this concert the day before my birthday on PBS and I was hooked. I hadn't seen Celtic Woman before, but I knew of them through my music teacher, so this second concert was the first I'd seen. My mother got me the CD and I listen to it all the time. It's in my car, on my mp3 player, on my computer, and I watch the DVD all the time. The girls sound like angels and everything is so tasteful and beautiful it really does spoil you for all other types of musical performances. CW was just recently in my home town and I wasn't planning on seeing them in person, but a friend of mine was so my mother and I got togehter with my friend and her mom and I was BLOWN AWAY! Everything was PERFECT! The songs, the beautiful dresses, the instrumentalists, the lights, everything! So now I'm on a Celtic Woman high and hopefully I never come down off it. It's so wonderful and peaceful. You have to see this and if you get the chance to see them live, go for it. The new addition of Hayley Westenra is lovely, too. I am now a big fan of hers. She stands out quite a bit among Meav, Orla, Chole, Lisa and Mairead. Check all of their solo CDs out too! You'll be pleased!

014027409X|5.0|(This review covers the 21-chapter version.)     A Clockwork Orange could so easily have been atrocious. Instead, it is a classic, and deservedly so. Burgess has crafted a brilliantly original novel, with a distinctive and unique cockney-Slavic idiom. Aside from the novelty, and the aesthetic innovations, A Clockwork Orange is also an enjoyable book to read. I got the sense whilst reading, however, that, in lesser hands, a novel with similar aspirations would most likely have fizzled into overly-self-aware pretension and gratuitousness. That Burgess pulled it off is testament to his talent.    I do think that the 21st chapter seems a bit tacked-on, and the coda of the 20th, to me at least, is a better, more apposite ending. But this is a minor quibble, and most people like to end a book with optimism anyway.
1582701709|4.0|This book is a quick read.  It compiles all the things you have read or heard before into one nice neat location, and gives you reason to pause and consider the possibilities. I have begun to put some of the simple principles into action. All you need to have to read this book is an open mind and a willingness to make yourself a better person. It's about personal growth and development and obtaining those things that you sincerely desire for your life. <br /> <br />Peace
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have been a Jane Eyre fan since I was 15, and I can honestly say that this is the best adaptation of the book I have ever seen.  Ruth & Toby are phenomenal, in my opinion they give a dimension to the characters that may be even better than the book!  (I can't believe I'm saying that!  But it's true!)  Parts are so marvelously intense, you may need to stop the film & take a breather before continuing.  Buy it!  In fact, buy it for ever woman in your life, they will love it!

For those that need to be enlighten as to how to make their life better this a one of the many books to read.  Also, read Joel Olsteen's \\"Your Best Life Now\\".  Both books reaffirmed that we reap what we sow, be it in actions, thoughts or words.
B00080ETV8|5.0|In describing my thoughts and feelings for the movies Jane Eyre and Middlemarch, it's like telling someone of an old friend. I love to watch these movies over and over again, just to get the raw education and great historical lessons from the land of my ancestry. In Jane Eyre, you have Mr. Rodchester slinging out so many ten dollar words that are not so commonly used in our American discourse, that you feel like you've just been to college and your among the elite in society. You also have the typical themes of the Rich verses Poor, and unprincipaled verses the godly and chaste. But what I like most about Jane Eyre beside the education, was how that one line spoken by Mr. Rodchester seemed to sum up what happened, and what would eventually turn to his good. He said: \\"fate has out maneuvered me or providence checked me\\" and to that the minister said Amen! Mr. Rodchester's fate of trying to force a marriage with a godly sweet angel before it's time, was rewarded at the end of the show by the Providence of God. God allowed him to be judged by fire, but then answered his hopes and prayers by letting the whisp of his anguish travel over the air, hundreds of miles to the awaiting ears of his true love. And with Jane about to enter into a marriage with a steely cleric with no heart of love for her, she received the message on the wind from God and from Mr. Rodchester just in the nick of time, and she fled to her fulfillment. I highly recommend Jane Eyre for viewing over and over again, it's an education and a heart throbbing love story all wrapped up into one. Now as far as the history lesson of MiddleMarch is concerned, time and space will not allow enough to be said about this show. It was not your typical English film, this is a series of many plots and sub plots, which show the true nature and character of a growing nation. A snippet out of time, a viewing of the developing countryside society of England's heart land. Once again though, the English protray the villian as a clergyman, and the so called good clergyman, was a pool playing, card playing, pub attendee. But the other plots of love and of riches carries well, and one wishes that Dr. Lidgate would have married Dorothea. This film has many of your favorite English actors in it, and is the kind of movie that you have spend a lot of time with and engross yourself in, to really enjoy......When we want to watch an old favorite, MiddleMarch is right up there with Pride and Prejudice, Emma and Sense and Sensibility. You'll be enriched and educated if you spend time with both of these films. We loved them!as a clergyman, and the so called good clergyman, was a pool playing, card playing, pub attendee.

B000I2JKEC|4.0|I remember superman since I was a kid. It was huge back in its day. This definitely brought back memories - but I'll stick to the quality of the movie in terms of the HD version. <br />So I thought I would do it justice and watch it on my 1080p screen. I was not disappointed. For a film of its time, I think it looks fantastic in HD. <br />It will not have the clarity and sharpness of today's HD films, but seriously this movie is as old as I am, and back then a Sony Trinitron was the best you could have. <br /> <br />I think its worth the money and definitely worth having in your HD collection. <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|the funniest dirty old man ever and a very funny script make this a winner <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites.  The story was so good and the scenery was very pretty.  This is just one of those movies you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it.  I thought the love story was very heartwarming and the love is so innocent, the way it should be.  I highly recommend this movie.  I love drama and this movie is rated 2nd among the movies I like.  I just love every minute of it and it leaves you feeling good.
0143036238|5.0|I really enjoyed the sense of humour and the plot. The action is developing very slow so if you are not fond of this kind of a plot you might not like it.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|Its an great epic about WW2 Submariners. Always a good story line. Made great in this movie. If you have a good home theater. The depth charge scene is going to really test the limits of your system. Enjoy the movie like I did.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|I am not a music critic.  I am just an ordinary music lover, of the eclectic variety.  I absolutely loved the first album.  Do like the second one, especially with a different setting.  But my one disappointment is that several songs from the first album were repeated.  Would have preferred all new songs.  These women have such pure tones.  A true joy to listen to and the fiddler is just fun with her antics.  All eye candy and not bad on the ears either.  How old is Chloe now?  I do spend some time looking at the designs of the gowns and critiqueing the style for the body.  That is another topic, though.
B000JVSUS4|3.0|The back story blows! But of course the Action sequences of the actual battle are what makes this movie worth watching. Who ever wrote the back story should be gutted then burned. What could have been a great movie was ruined.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Although I thoroughly enjoy all of Norah Jones's CDs, I think that this is still my favorite Norah Jones CD. I love her pretty romantic songs; and she has such a sensual & beautiful voice. I highly recommend this CD!

B000NA2776|5.0|Kids love the beat, my daughter requested it for her 15th birthday and was very happy.
B000MRA5EM|3.0|This film barely rates 3 stars. The photography is good, but the content is limited and the title \\"Deep Sea\\" is really a misnomer as most of the photography is shot at a depth of 50 feet or less. At 40 minutes, the film is too short to show much diversity and it is actually much shorter because the director also uses valuable footage to make a case that we are overfishing the ocean by showing dead reefs, etc.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|Best album of 2007.  A heavily textured, energetic album that is great from beginning to end.  Each and every song has its own disticnt feel and sound.  A very, very talented band with a tremendous future in front of them.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Okay at first you thought \\"Oh god what's going on?\\", well that's what I thought when I heard Girlfriend. But you know what? I love it now! It's a whole new style, not only that it shows avril in a new light. It's obvious from the album she's having fun and seems...happier than ever before. I especially love the power ballads. <br /> <br />-Girlfriend is a catchy song, nothing serious, just a fun song to sing ( annoyingly addictive too) <br /> <br />-I can do better reminds us of the old avril lavigne, no she isnt dead, it's a great song, not my personal favorite though. <br /> <br />-Runaway is one of the best on the album, very catchy tempo and suits avril's voice especially well. I love the chorus, i can really identify wih this song. If you're not happy when you hear this, by the end of the song you'll probably have a stupid smile on your face. <br /> <br />-The best damn thing was not what I expected, it starts very cheerleader like, this is something she's fond of and I am not really but it works with her voice. But seriously the lyrics are great, it just shows what avril is all about and how she got what she always wanted \\"her own cinderella story\\". <br /> <br />-When you're gone is a strong power ballad, which apparently she hadn't intented but it is beautiful, not as original as I thought it would be though. It doesn't make me want to cry as much as Innocence. <br /> <br />-Everything Back but you, this is another \\"old avril song\\", similar a little to her last album, very rock and rebel - it's good but not shockingly so. <br /> <br />-Hot, Now I loved this song. Not only because of the lyrics but of the tempo and the melody. It's an amazing song, she's able to work her lyrics really well into the song, it's the type you'll want to sing and won't forget. ( did I forget to say, it's probably about Deryck)  <br /> <br />-Innocence, this is my favorite song of all the album (I like them all really), it's a powerful ballad. It reminds of myself a lot, it picturesa certain stage in your life which is precious - it shows how versatile Avril can be, i love this song. <br /> <br />-I dont have to try, well this is the first song Im not that keen on. The high pitch screams are a little much for me, they don't work that well. This rocky fast song combined with cheerleader vocals might appeal to some people but the \\"die\\" scream at the end ... well you'll see. <br /> <br />-One of those girls, you can already imagine what it's going to be about knowing Avril's style. The rythm and melody is still catchy, it's a good song really but i don't think it brings anything to the album. <br /> <br />-Contagious, the beginning reminds of one of Blink 182's songs. This is a great song, and I agree it's probably about her husband (weird saying that now huh?!), mix of rocky and punky.  <br /> <br />Keep holding on well has nothing to do with the album really but it's still a great power ballad. It just doesnt reflect the album.  <br />All in all it's one of the best album of Avril lavigne so definitely worth buying. Punky, rocky, fun and powerful is what I'd use to describe this album. So what if it isn't the old gloomy style? It's a great change and way more upbeat album, I can't wait for what she has in store for us!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Overall I think the album is excellent. Powerful lyrics and great arrangement.
B000I5X81K|4.0|My first impression of this album was that it was not as good as the previous. I found a couple of the cuts to be 'dark and depressed' and others to be a  bit too 'preachy'. But there are some great pieces on the album as well. It is unfortunate that he did not include the title cut \\"Awake\\" on this CD. It is absolutely beautiful and, in my opinion, should have been released before \\"February Song\\".  <br /> <br />I have all of his albums and I have seen him in concert 4 times, the most recent being April 7th in Las Vegas. As I've come to listen to this album and understand the stories behind the songs, I have come to appreciate it more. I do like the tempo changes and the challenge to reach out to different styles of music. I think this is the Josh of the future as he continues to expand into different genres of music. I just hope he sticks to his roots and doesn't reach too far.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I tried to watch this twice. To see what the hype was. I fell asleep both times. Not funny just slow, boring, and stupid. WAY OVERATED!
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|If you like the music in a scene that just blends in and makes the scene even more emotional or suspenseful, that is what the scores from season one do on this cd.  I initially bought it to for the prologue (cylon music) and the two main titles (U.S. and U.K.) but after listening to the entire cd, I have become completely addicted to it.  The titles of the scores usually give you a hint of the scene and the liner notes also tell you the episode that they are from but the soundtrack has definitely made rewatching season one an even more intriguing experience.  The scores with words, are written by Bear and are in various languages, but the words, especially the opera piece, are actually so dead one with the scene and in this specific scene hilarious.  I love this soundtrack.  If you are someone who is addicted to really grasping everything that happens in this show and watch and analyze it beyond face value, this is an added bonus to have in your collection. I highly recommend it!!!

B000KX0IOA|5.0|When I first saw this film in 1982, it reminded me of one of David Lean's epics.  Like Lawrence of Arabia or Dr. Zhivago, it tells a story of nations and political movements from the perspective of a single person.  The cast is top notch, the acting is superb (Ben Kingsley is amazing in this role), and the photography is gorgeous. <br /> <br />So it's a must-see film, but what about the dvd?  In a word, terrific!  The sound and color all look wonderful, and the extra features are informative.  I cannot say how this dvd edition compares to the one that came out about five years ago, but if you don't already own a dvd copy of this film, you won't be disappointed with this one.

B000002J2F|5.0|For me \\"Duke\\" is the last truly great Genesis album. Although I find bits and pieces that I like in the band's \\"commercial\\" years in the 80's and early 90's, I think this is the last time that the band put a total album of great songs together.  The album was a huge commercial success and vaulted the band into major radio airplay with the singles \\"Misunderstanding\\", and \\"Turn It On Again\\".  The first 2/3rds of the album are shorter songs, but most of them are solid.  The album ends with \\"Duke's Travels\\" and \\"Duke's End\\" which rank up with the band's best progressive rock work.  Tony Bank's keyboard solo on \\"Dukes Travels\\" is especially impressive.  The shorter songs are mostly good here too.  \\"Behind The Lines\\", \\"Duchess\\", \\"Guide Vocal\\", \\"Man Of Our Times\\", \\"Cul De Sac\\" are all great songs.  Collins was going through a divorce from his 1st wife during the writing of this album which becomes the subject of \\"Please Don't Ask\\".  Drum machines show up for the first time on this disc and are especially apparent during \\"Duchess\\".  They would continue to be a part of Genesis music for the rest of the band's career.  Even with the machines Collins drumming is up front throughout and powerful as ever.  \\"Duke\\" was very much a transitional album for the band, but enough of what originally made them great was still present to make this one of their top ranked albums.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Great TV series for adults and teens.  Some material may be inappropriate for children. &Uuml;
0596007124|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It is fun, easy to read and understand and gives a good, though informal, introduction to design patterns using Java for samples. This doesn't mean the design patterns explained can not be applied to any OO language. It gives a good explanation of the problems each of the design patterns is intended to solve. Overall - a very good book.
B000MM1F5A|5.0|The cd of the concert was excellent, but the dvd documents and illuminates the history of the beautiful fado music of Portugal in such a meaningful way.  Truly a masterpiece.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is a good companion to Neil's Unplugged record.  They are both live, acoustic sets (Massey Hall is solo, no harmonica), and many of the same songs are played.  I like both his mature, gritty voice of the 90's and his more pure falsetto of the early 70's.  Neither is better; both are great. <br /> <br />He recorded this album before the release of \\"Harvest\\" and was playing many \\"new\\" songs from that upcoming album.  It's fascinating that the audience has no reaction to the (now) familiar opening chords of some classic songs, not knowing that these unfamiliar tunes would go on to become classics.   <br /> <br />The dvd is great; not a traditional concert film, probably because the pictures available are dark and grainy with usually only a close-up of Neil's face...but the film makers took advantage of this and wove in home movies and other video with the same grainy look.  I felt like I was there in Toronto 36 years ago.
0374105235|5.0|A Long Way Gone is powerful testimony to the vulnerability and resilience of childhood.  Every time I thought Ishmael's life couldn't get worse, I tried to put the book down yet was renewed by the photo on the back cover.  His story is one I will never forget.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|The two stars of thie performance are the top of their fields. Both have excellent voices and are very good actors. The music is delightful and full of humor. A great combination.
0439813786|4.0|I teach children's lit, and I don't really understand all the hype about this book.  It is good; it may make children interested to find out more about the early history of film.  But it certainly isn't the greatest book ever.  Look at a library copy before you rush out and buy one.
B000065V3H|3.0|This is another good teen comedy from the 80'. It's a shame that the DVD release is fullscreen. This movie deserves a deluxe DVD treatment.
032147404X|3.0|The book might be good for beginners. I don't even think it is enough for amateurs. The book does describe what you need to do step by step, but for the price, I would expect more technique and tips. I am not saying the book is not good, but the information is just too little (for its price).
B00005JMEW|5.0|I ain't picky regarding looking for tiny little flaws. I just like Kill Bill 1 and 2.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I am a life-long Bond fan.  I am one of the few Bond fans I know of that actually has positive things to say about all of the Bonds.  Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all were different and brought what the producers thought they needed to bring to the franchise.  But, Craig was a great addition to the franchise.  I don't care if he's blond-headed and blue-eyed.  He is a great fit for where the Bond franchise is headed. <br /> <br />Also, the movie plot, action sequences, direction, etc. all took huge leaps in the right direction.  I was very concerned about the future of the franchise after the horrible computer enhanced, over-the-top unbelieveable garbage they pulled in Die Another Day. <br /> <br />Casino Royale is what Bond films were and should be!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This quite simply is one of the best concerts I have ever enjoyed on dvd. <br />All of the women featured here have incredable voices. Their harmonies on several of the numbers are as if you had one person's voice spread out into 5 parts. Mav on the violin is a delite to watch flowing all over the stage and is still able to play the complicated songs she performs. Add in a big screen tv and you are in the front row center. My wife and I have watched the concert at least twice a week sense we purchased it. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves the arts.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|You normally would expect a gospel based sound on an album which is inspired by a religious theme. On the contrary this album even has a more \\"dark\\" sound than it's ancestors ('One' and 'Questionmark'). It is unbelievable how Neal Morse can combine those - for me - completely contradicting 'styles' into an consistent sounding progressive rock album. The man must be a genius I guess?!

B0009QTS1M|5.0|Russell Crowe and this picture deserved their Oscars for this terrific movie. I wish they could make another. This was undoubtedly Ridley Scott's best turn as a Director since Alien. He also deserved the Oscar. <br />A rare movie gets a great story which includes not only action but love and presents both to good effect. The set offers many great insights to those of us who need to know how things work. So buy it if you need to know, I did and was not disapointed other than to want even more! Again I say a 5 Star Bravo for this movie and an additional Star for all the variations and extras it contains.
074356619X|5.0|After viewing the DVD of \\"The Secret\\", I knew that I wanted to exercise the ideas that were presented, but experienced difficulty in execution.  I needed more details in order to awaken the genie within.  Just by chance, I was reading through the reviews of others here about this audiobook version of \\"The Secret\\" and realized that the detail that I was missing has been abundantly assembled.  I have applied the details and HIGHLY recommend this version.  The 4 CD's total over 4 hours of information, and with application, will supply you with your heart's desire.  One of the complaint's about the DVD is that there wasn't enough detail.  Well, here it is, in all it's glory.  Do the work, and you will receive abundant benefit.  Kristian Alexis Perry, April 2007
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have observed Bond first in books and then on screen from the beginning. After Connery no one compared until Craig returns Bond to his real roots. Dispassionate killer. The suave part is only the thin veneer of civilization that  the \\"real \\" Bond uses as a cloak. I am looking forward to the my twilight years with the return of Bond as I grew up knowing him as a model for every hard man both in body and spirit that is portrayed in literature. I give this movie and this collection a 5 Star Bravo.
B0004Z33G4|4.0|Even if you haven't watched rambo in a few years or this is your first time watching it the trilogy is one of the most action packed collections you will find around.  First blood is probably the best of all but the other two are very good.  I highly recommend giving these a look.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is a very interesting story, with an unexpected end. It's a collector's item.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Short Bus was nothing short of amazing.  I can't even imagine how to describe it.  I'll just say it must be seen to be believed.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I just bought the single \\"What I've Done\\" off iTunes and at first I didn't like it. It sounded a like a boy band. But it did grow on me and after several times listening to it, I have to say I can hear part of the old Linkin Park in it. I'm a die hard Linkin Park fan so I hope their new Album will be equally great as the single. I'll think of this single as the mellow Linkin Park. I don't know what the rest of their album will be like but I will surely buy this album just because I'm a loyal fan. Hopefully it won't be dissapointing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" is the type of series that \\"grows\\" on you.  I remember that the first time I watched it on T.V., I could not quite get it at the time.  This was until I saw \\"Serenity\\".  \\"Serenity\\" actually made me go and purchase the complete series.  I would recommend it to anyone, who likes SciFi movies other than StarWars (flashy). <br /> <br />It's hard to describe why one likes it.  You either like it or hate it.  I fall into the first category. :-)
B000088E6D|5.0|What an amazing talent !!!!  My wife and I have been in the music performing business for 35 years.  We both know a great singer when we hear one. <br />Ed & Rosie Butler
1401302378|4.0|This is a look from the inside as to the operating strategies of an Internet business.  <br />It is quite illuminating about this form of retailing although occasionally tedious due to the detail. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it is well worthwhile and when completed, I had a very good understanding \\"how the watch worked\\".
B000NA77YO|5.0|Despite some missing songs, this cd rocks. My only complaint,I wish there could have been more of 1992s \\"Dehumanizer\\". All in all you really could hear why Dio was such a much needed shot of creative adrenaline Black Sabbath needed after Ozzy Ozbournes departure in 1979. Vocally and lyrically Dio took Sabbath in uncharted waters, and left a no bull legacy with Sabbath. From 1.1980s \\"Heaven And Hell\\", 2.1981s \\"Mob Rules\\" and 3.1992s \\"Dehumanizer\\", Dio was large and in charge with a no bull attitude, with energetic pulsating lyrics and blistering vocals. The three new songs recorded on this cd with Dio made me get this cd. 1.\\"Devil Cried\\", 2.\\"Shadow Of The Wind\\", 3.\\"Ear In The Wall\\" have grown on me and let me know Dio has still got his magical touch. Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler still play an awesome guitar. Ozzy Ozbourne will always be the lead singer with Black Sabbath, but believe me, Dio is incredible with Black Sabbath as he has added and still adds his own style to the band. I also picked up a couple of Tour 2007 t-shirts. Man I'm glad Ronnie James Dio is back touring live with Black Sabbath. This cd is an excellent Ronnie James Dio with Black Sabbath history lesson.
1577314808|5.0|This book contains enough wisdom to last a lifetime. In fact, if one could choose a book with which to be stranded on a desert island, I'd vote for The Power of Now.   Eckhart Tolle clearly has a deep understanding of the mystic life and the ability to express it in a simple and straightforward fashion, with a wry humor as well.   <br /> <br />The book is universal so that readers of all religions and those without any religious orientation can equally benefit.  A truly inspiring work that will be read and re-read and capable of effecting change in lives, and thus in the larger world. You'll find your copy dog-eared and a favorite companion. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. A great gift for those seeking a deeper understanding of their lives.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|First of all, I hate most of John Mayer's albums.They are full of shlocky love songs that I detest. But I saw John on \\"Austin City Limits\\" with Buddy Guy and he blew me away, great guitar work, great voice, and he could rock - Hard. Like Stevie Ray Vaughn, but with a better voice.  <br />So where was this guy on all these other albums? Well I found him on this album, Smokin guitar, funky as hell, the whole package. This is, bar none, the best work John Mayer has ever done. I wish he would put the pop crap aside and do more stuff like this.
1582701709|1.0|Both my husband & I have read \\"The Secret\\" the book has inspired us in how we look at situations in our lives; yes, it is what we already know but we often loose sight of the positive ways to live our lives...We also purchased the DVD and enjoyed watching it, after reading the book....the DVD was the frosting ont he cake, so to speak, with listening to each person tell their story in person, being a visual person as I am it really clicked for me, both of us could identify with stories.... <br />We were so inspired with the book & DVD that we purchased 10 books and sent them to family and friends, they too enjoyed the book, we all have adopted the philosphy of \\"The Secret\\" and look at life in a whole other way.....we have passed One DVD on to all and once they view it they pass it on to the next couple...also other friends we spoke about the secret to have gone out to purchase the book and they too enjoyed it... <br />We need more positive approaches in our lives and world...thank you,  <br />M.E.

B0000VCZKW|5.0|I've taken to reading the source material of a lot of movie adaptations with my seven year old (who has read E.B. White's Stuart Little and Trumpet of the Swan, both of which are shadows of the original stories albeit entertaining fare despite that).  Not only does this adaptation stay true to the story, it does so without losing any of the impact of Matilda's quest to find her place in the world. <br /> <br />What I particularly like is this strong female protaganist--I don't think there's a child who will watch this film who doesn't wish he or she were as strong, brave or gifted as Matilda.  <br /> <br />Both of my boys love this movie, although the little one hides during the assembly sequence (not that I blame him, it's pretty gross), and my older one insists that I sit with him during the Trunchbull's chase scene. <br /> <br />Good family entertainment--this is one children's film that parents can and should watch with their kids.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Jason Reitman`s \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" would make an interesting companion piece to \\"Lord of War,\\" since both are sharp, acerbic satires about industries - one tobacco, the other small arms - whose practitioners are often referred to as \\"merchants of death.\\"<br /><br />Based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" centers on Nick Naylor, a smooth-talking lobbyist for Big Tobacco whose job it is to counter all the medical charges leveled against cigarettes so that people will go right on using the product despite the fact that Americans are dropping dead from heart disease, cancer and emphysema at the rate of well over 430,000 people a year.  The triumph of the film is that it resists the temptation to paint everything in broad strokes or to reduce all its figures to the level of simpleminded caricatures.  Naylor may be an amoral cretin in the profession he has chosen to pursue, but as played by the brilliant Aaron Eckhart, he also has a bit of a conscience and the semi-redeeming traits of insecurity, vulnerability and a deep and abiding love for his devoted young son.  Writer/director Jason Reitman \\"humanizes\\" the characters even as he skewers them mercilessly for how they have chosen to live their lives.  Naylor, for instance, is part of an informal group labeled \\"the Mod Squad,\\" - short for \\"Merchants of Death\\" - consisting of Naylor plus two other lobbyists, one from the alcohol industry and one from the gun manufacturers, who meet regularly at a local bar to bemoan their standing as social pariahs and to argue over which of the three industries scores the most deaths per annum.  These characters could easily have been overdrawn and turned into callous villains, but we find ourselves actually liking them - much as we do Naylor - partly because they remain loyal to their buddy when the going gets tough for him and his world threatens to fall to pieces around him.<br /><br />Indeed it is this feeling of ambivalence we have towards Naylor that makes \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" more than just an anti-smoking jeremiad, for the movie beautifully approximates the seductive power of men like Naylor and makes us aware of how easily we too fall under their spell.  Eckhart is so charismatic, charming and convincing in the role of Naylor that we find ourselves in the unusual position of practically rooting for him to prevail, even though, intellectually, we can pretty much see through the speciousness of his arguments.  The filmmakers are to be commended for not softening the material by turning Naylor into the conventional anti-hero who eventually sees the evils of his ways and does everything in his power to make reparations for the damage and suffering he has caused.  For even though Naylor does have a \\"soft,\\" likable side to his personality, it isn't always enough to make him do the right thing in every situation or to make all the politically correct speeches the audience believes should be coming from the mouth of a reformed wrongdoer.  The filmmakers make it clear that Naylor \\"reforms\\" only up to a point, for there is still a great deal of flimflamery lurking in the core of his genes.  Moreover, Buckley and Reitman don't let the anti-smoking forces entirely off the hook either.  The movie often shows them as both extreme (one group even kidnaps and nicotine-poisons Naylor to get him to stop what he's doing) and insufferably self-righteous and petty (one senator wants to digitally erase all the cigarettes from old movies).<br /><br />Eckhart, who has always been a very fine actor despite never having achieved superstar status in Hollywood, should have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his dazzling, finely-tuned turn here as a man it is easy to criticize but hard to hate.  He is bolstered by an outstanding cast that includes J.K. Simmons, Maria Bello, David Koechner, Kim Dickens, William H. Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe and Sam Elliott.  Special note should be taken of young Cameron Bright (\\"X-Men 3\\"), who brings spirit and depth to the role of Naylor's impressionable but clear-eyed and levelheaded teenage son.<br /><br />\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" is a rarity among American films in that it provides genuine food for thought while amusing the heck out of us at the same time.ngs spirit and depth to the role of Naylor's impressionable but clear-eyed and levelheaded teenage son.      \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" is a rarity among American films in that it provides genuine food for thought while amusing the heck out of us at the same time.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|One of the best Bond movies ever - this goes back to what James Bond is supposed to be.  Daniel Craig is right up there with Sean Connery.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The 007 series has been the most successful and longest running series in history. What began as a series of books by Ian Fleming, has lasted for fifty years. It has been immortalized by Sean Connery & Roger Moore. It has been kept current by Pierce Brosnan, but as time goes by, the old stale formula can't continue to draw interest or box office returns.<br /><br />So, what do you do? You give the world of Bond a curveball. You keep the spirit of Bond; the ladies man, the gadgets, the high risk stunts, the adrenaline pumping action, the bow tie, the suit and the cars, but you give the man a new personality. This is the genius of CASINO ROYALE, and the very thing that is gonna keep the spirit and the series alive for lord knows how much longer.<br /><br />The one thing that all the Bond movies have done in the past is give James Bond the same personality. We have numerous changes in the actor, but the personality of the character is always the same. CASINO ROYALE kept most of the character of Bond, but with Daniel Craig, they've given the series an adrenaline jolt with an unlikely Bond and a slightly skewed Bond.<br /><br />The first twenty minutes takes you into the fast paced, well-thought out thrill ride and introduces you to a character who isn't as clean cut as the suit may suggest. The world has changed around us. We live in an age of danger, terrorism and war and knowing that, the BOND series required a man to fit the part.<br /><br />James Bond is in tact and I can't wait to see what more they're gonna throw at us. The series continues to be the most energetic successful gotta see more series in history, thanks to a knife toting Daniel Craig.<br /><br />This is one of the best action movies to come along in a long time. I'm a tough nut to crack, and I was sitting wide-eyed and bushy-tailed, popping popcorn, eager for more and disappointed when the credits rolled.
0590259385|5.0|We have kind of a family in-joke about llamas, so when I saw this book, I had to get it for our daughter.  Since then, I'm so glad I did!  She loves it, and I love reading it to her...the rhyme and rhythym are excellent, and the illustrations are classy and amusing.  I love all the different animals, and the introduction to the different behaviors. <br />My daughter is one now, and she still enjoys this book; I imagine she will for years to come.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This movie just gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling. It is a good movie to watch snuggled up on a couch with some hot chocolate or something that effect. It is the first movie that I saw Jude Law in and thought he was a hottie. A definite added bonus.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|As a fan of documentaries I have to say this is one of the best I've ever seen. It really puts a human face on the horrible suffering of war. The understated narration of Laurence Olivier and the tastefully sparse use of mood music make a far bigger impact on the viewer than another approach might. Small wonder this documentary is perenially shown on TV.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|wow this was one of the most disappointing movies i've seen in quite some time.  i'm shocked at the critical acclaim and despondent about the prospect of another decade or more with this dried lump of poo in the 007 role.  yeah he comes off as \\"a blunt weapon\\" as advertised, but where's the charm?  also, an exhaustive survey of women has revealed that actual living breathing human beings do not as a general rule find daniel craig's face at all attractive.  i will say the opening action scene was cool and promising, but after that you find yourself watching like an hour of what appears to be a lame high-stakes international texas hold'em tournament : .  meh, I say we dump the bond series and make a ton of transporter movies instead!
1582701709|5.0|I loved the secret it truly changed my mindset and thinking about life.. Having a positive out look in life and loving yourself then others makes all the difference. Thanks to the Secret I have felt a burden lifted off my shoulders for good.

B000N3SS80|5.0|Jennifer Lopez is at her best with her first ever full length spanish album Como Ama una Mujer is just amazing!! I'm not a Latino nor do I know Spanish but, I absolutely love this album!! You can take this album and dance to it in a club in my opinion!! There are some very beautiful ballads on this album. I have all of Jennifer Lopez's albums and I love all of them but, I think Como Ama una Mujer is by far the best album that Jennifer Lopez has ever done and worth of dollar!!! Everything about this album is just a amazing!!! This is by far a must have album for any Jennifer Lopez fan!!!!
B000BFH2S2|5.0|A truly great album and even better DVD to watch the show live.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I have always loved this movie, and you don't have you be young to enjoy it. This DVD is a great family film with comical and entertaining performances by Danny DeVito and many others. Great buy!
B00005JMYI|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you truly are missing out.  Not a single person I know who has seen it, doesn't like it.
1598561634|5.0|This edition of BHS is beautiful, hardcover with cream-colored pages, a ribbon marker, and a good size Hebrew font (with diacritics). Introduction is in German, Latin, English, French, and Spanish. Notes on each page give various information, including Greek examples from the Septuagint (my favorite part). The book although nice is not oversized, at about 7 1/4\\" X 5 1/4\\" or so, very convenient. If you are a student of Hebrew you will get your money's worth.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|When this Bond film opens, it's evident that this is NOT going to be like any of the Bond films since Connery. There is NO opening snow skiing sequence...instead we get a riveting (and I mean riveting) action sequence that takes us high above an African city, into the construction cranes of an under construction building. <br /> <br />Then, it's a bit of Bizarro world....If we accept that Dame Judi Dench is the M we're familiar with from the past couple of outings, then we have a bit of a jolt when we realize that Daniel Craig's James Bond is not yet a double O. He has yet to earn that (he quickly does). So based on Judi Dench's presence as M, we're warping backward in time to see Bond reinvented. <br /> <br />It's a small price to pay. Dench is great as M and Craig....well, Craig completely reinvents the character. He's bold, brash, callous and reckless. He doesn't play at all the same things Roger Moore (way too foppish), Timothy Dalton (too jaded - but up until now far better than Moore or Brosnan), and Pierce Brosnan (a bit to flippant for me) did. <br /> <br />This film also holds the distinction of having the most cohesive and believable of plotlines of any Bond film in recent memory. There are no satellites with death rays. There are no super sci fi plastic surgeries or silly villains (Jaws). This plot has Bond searching for a man who is financing terrorists by very plausible means, who ultimately must risk everything to secure money he lost in an ill fated attempt to sabotage a publicly traded company's newest product. It works. It works absolutely. Is our villain wicked and weird? Oh yeah. But he's also suave, quiet and handsome. Then there's a very underplayed medical condition that causes one tear duct to weep blood. But it's subtle and yet creepy. <br /> <br />There's no Q. Bond wins the very famous Astin Martin in a card game. He doesn't care how his martini is made.  <br /> <br />Connery invented the character as a playboy who was suave, subtle and deadly. He was stealth embodied. Craig is only slightly suave, not the least subtle, and recklessly deadly. It's our old James Bond amped up for the modern era. <br /> <br />Connery's Bond was comfortable with the Rat Pack set (and still to me), but with all the societal changes that have taken place since then, Craig's Bond is a welcome change - one who, I suspect we will see, will evolve into a more refined spy than we witness in this first outing. <br /> <br />It's an evolution I'm looking forward to seeing.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|Even though the acting was quite skillful this movie just made me sick. As someone who has experienced real adversity, I found the worship of money and the platitudes in the film completely sickening. What about all the countless people who have had to use shelters and food banks who don't have an opportunity to be an intern for a stock brokerage firm? Are their lives useless? People get comfort from their religion or friends, not from a bunch of yuppies who work in a job that makes money from money. And who gives a (bad word inserted here) if he founded a brokerage firm and made millions selling it? Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn
B000000XB9|5.0|I heard the song \\"Put a Light in the Window\\" while driving one day and loved it, had never heard it before but recognized the group.  Never thought I would find it but did on Amazon.  It is an amazing CD and the price was excellent.  I suggest anyone who was a CCR fan back in the \\"olden days\\" purchase this classic.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I was so dissapointed in Babel.  Just because a movie is filmed well doesn't mean that it is a good movie.  If you want to fall asleep fast, take some Babel.
0061150142|5.0|I heard so many people tell me how amazing this book was. How they couldn't put it down. Got it, (of course, knowing me, I was already reading another book.) My sister told me we were going to read it in 12th grade, but I had already waited 2 years, and nothing was going to stop me now.<br /><br />I sat down and opened this book, its flimsy pages hanging off the side, and couldn't take my eyes off of it. The first little paragraph, what an eye opener. Jodi has such a way of drawing her readers in and feeling the characters feelings. Couldn't put it down. I wish I could give this book ONE MILLION stars, and, in my mind, I do. There has never been a book like this in my life, even when some come close. My mind is full of feelings left over from Chris, Emily, Gus, Melanie, Michael, Jordan, and, even Selena. What happens afterwards? Will they ever be friends again? These questions filling my mind, no answers, just my intuitions.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is astounding, her writing so moving. I will, from now on and always, gladly read any of her books.<br /><br />Read this book, and I gurantee you will fall in love with the author and, more importantly, 'The Pact.'
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|You will have to have seen the movie to appreciate the music...but once you hear it you will want to put it in our vehicle and drive down the PCH or any long trip to sing with it all over and over...and who doesn't love Hugh Grant and want to sing along with him? ha ha...
B00009W0U4|5.0|was forwarned about this one..but wanted to experience it myself. the directors camera style was very hard to take but overall added to the feeling of control being taken from you. great performances by all the actors. the reverse storytelling was used to great advantage. subtitles not to hard to follow..overall a shocking unexpected experience i would give 5 outa 5 to.

B000MCIBAW|5.0|\\"Strange Days\\" was The Doors' sophomore effort, the attempt at bringing back for another round the kind of feverish, poetic magic attained in their classic debut. Few follow-ups have achieved the kind of artistic, sonic accomplishments The Doors got here which is why many consider \\"Strange Days\\" their best effort, second only to their first album. Now in light of the 40th anniversary of the band's introduction to the world, Doors engineer Bruce Botnick has taken all their albums and remixed them from the original master tapes, what he achieves here, as with the remastered debut, is a complete resurrection of a classic recording. The album now breathes and screams with fierce energy and detail. The opening title track is now a true gothic opus as the effect of the first synthesizers is better appreciated in Jim Morrison's menacing delivery of a world gone insane. John Densmore's drums are heavy and intense while Ray Manzarek's organ is more defined. \\"Love Me Two Times\\" is a ferocious blues rocker with a killer bass now more audible while the creepiness of \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" a spoken-word piece Morrison wrote in high school, is more striking this time as many of the layered effects are clearer. \\"Moonlight Drive\\" has better piano/organ parts. Some purists have been scoffing at the remixing, claiming these are not the same albums. This is a wrong analysis, what Botnick has done is create a more clear, defined piece considering the older recordings suffered from the original technological setbacks of the 60s and in the case of the first album even the speed was off. Solos and instrumentals are easier to hear now and the sound quality is superior to anything previously released. This is the same debate that was sparked in 2002 when \\"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits\\" was released and was also bashed for taking the original masters and remixing them. These are the same songs, same vocals, same instrumentals, simply put back together to sound as they were originally intended to sound. \\"MyEyes Have Seen You For Example\\" has a sharper bass and piano section. Morrison's voice never plowed under, it is even more ferocious in this mix. The great epic \\"When The Music's Over\\" is a glorious powerhouse of musical expression and poetics mixed with rock. Morrison's frantic screams are brought up and Robby Krieger's masterful solo is also more detailed here. The song is a timeless work that is fitting for our current, uncertain times. In it Morrison speaks for a world caught in a war and a youth culture waiting to explode. If only he had known that in the Bush/Iraq era, his words would still be perfect for the times. \\"Strange Days\\" itself was originally released in 1968, right when Vietnam was starting to heat-up and more and more young Americans were returning in bodybags as others took to the streets. And yet what sets The Doors apart from other bands of the era is that their music is fitting for all times, all moods, because darkness is an ever present reality. Morrison was ahead of his time, this is more clear now than ever. His black leather-clad image of a wild, poetic frontman has been emulated countless times over, even his stage attitude was a precedent for Iggy Pop and Punk, listen to \\"Horse Latitudes\\" and you can see where Patti Smith was spawned. \\"Strange Days\\" is one of those great rock n' roll albums that will live on as long as there is music in the world, Jim Morrison will remain an icon for generations of rebels and the sound the Doors produced is set in stone. Now remixed and remastered, this album lives again, more potent, more dangerous than ever.
B000J103PC|5.0|A great movie and if you love Meryl you will love this movie, a keeper on DVD until Blue Ray or a microchip imbedded in your brain takes its place.
B000OW77UU|4.0|Yes, this movie is depressing...but it's REAL.  It's a movie about being human, but also about refusing to give up, and about sacrificing immediate comfort to see a dream through to its fruition.  Will Smith proves he can act and he doesn't need that stellar smile to sell a film.  The movie is slow and sometimes extremely depressing, but Smith's performance is so gripping that I couldn't help but cry and rejoice with him throughout the film.
B000KJU182|5.0|There are a number of classic historical novels that transfer well to movies without actually losing the story. Herman Melville's \\"Billy Budd, Foretopman\\" is one such classic. <br /> <br />In addition to being an outstanding story with great, solid characters, this is based on the actual events that occurred within the British Navy during its war with France. The major mutiny at the English port of Spithead, had word reached the sailing fleet, would have undermined Britain's stand against Napoleon and a potential French invasion. <br /> <br />Billy Budd, a simple lad and merchant seaman, is pressed into service in the Royal Navy on the high seas, a common practice of the time. Out of the entire merchant crew, he is the only one who says he will keep his knowledge of the Spithead mutiny to himself - a mutiny that eventually brought major changes to the treatment of British sailors. <br /> <br />The backstory, as are so many, is one of good vs. evil. However, without hitting the reader or viewer over the head with unrelenting morality, the story itself, the acting by classic actors and the direction by Peter Ustinov, who also stars as Captain Vere, work together to bring that essence to the fore. <br /> <br />The entire story takes place on a British Man-o-War in 1797. In addition to Peter Ustinov, Terence Stamp makes his major film role debut. Other stars include Robert Ryan, Melvin Douglas and a very young David McCallum (Dr. \\"Ducky\\" Mallard on TV's NCIS). There are also many other well known actors in supporting roles. <br /> <br />For anyone who enjoys a great story, this is a movie to watch. For anyone who enjoys great historical fiction, especially on the high seas, this is a must. A well produced version of the story that, in black and white, was transferred extremely well to DVD. <br />
1582701709|1.0|Just think of all the tangible good that could be done in the world with all the millions upon millions of dollars the authors of The Secret are making through the book, the DVD, the CD, the speaking gigs etc. etc. Why, there would be millions up millions of dollars to help build wells in Africa, help those with Aids, find cures for diseases, eliminate homelessnesss.... <br /> <br />Not to mention, if every person who plunks down $20 -50 for the Secret also got out of the \\"me\\" syndrome and started to think about others.   <br /> <br />The Secret is no secret.  It appeals to our society who believes happiness is found by getting what we want all the time.  Life isn't easy, and some of my greatest life lessons have been learned when I have faced challenges and struggles.  I believe the real secret to joy and contentment is to turn our attention off of ourselves once in awhile and use that energy and those resources to love and help others.
B00003CXV4|5.0|This movie has a sweetness and softness that I love but it still has some laughs and irony.  It is a nice mixture which also includes tears and as a whole it is a movie that I do recommend.  Romanticism is definitely the main ingredient.  Charlize Theron has a wonderful portrayal, not usual with her.
B00009NHC5|5.0|This movie is great in several ways - all Audrey hepburn fans would love it.  She shows that her talent is more than just a beautiful face. <br />It is also a front runner, because it shows the artistry of a great filmmaker, who can build suspense and tension merely with the use of light, of staging, without resorting to the cheap tricks of excessive violence.  The film's use of light and shadow is amazing. The timing of the characters exits and entrances is like watching a finely tuned play.  ( this was a play actually.)   This one will have you on the edge of your chair. The famous ending scene will take your breath away every time, even if you've seen it before! When Suzy's husband finally gets home and realizes what has happened, his reaction is lame - they should have rewritten that one. But that is only 2 minutes, so don't let that keep you from watching this one.  Rent this movie for your teens who like suspense thrillers - they will enjoy it.  <br />
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|Fantastik and magical, like a vintage wine and it gets better with repeat listenings!
B000HT2P9S|5.0|I was absolutely amazed by this book. Suitably dark for the author of the comic Sandman, this book incorporates the world of myth into the present reality. Anyone who enjoys mythology will love trying to figure out who all of the gods are before they are revealed...and enjoy their places within the story. Those who are not mythology fans will simple enjoy a well-written and certainly creative story.<br /><br />Anansi Boys, also by Gaiman, is next on my list...
0446691437|5.0|This book will get you to identify and conquer Resistance.  I think it is one of the best 'self help' books that I have read in a long time.  I will get you out of your rut and back to doing your work.  In today's society we have so many distractions that many of us do not do our work, we just bounce from one distraction to the next.  The distractions can be TV, Internet, Email, Cell phones, IM's are all forms of Resistance.  This book will help you identify and overcome Resistance.
B000784WMW|4.0|I like this version, its very passionate and sweet but at the same time, I am sitting there thinking.  If Timothy Dalton is supposed to be ugly, heaven help.  :)  Even when he was scarred by the fire I was like, still a fox.  I thought it was very detailed with her youth, although they were very careful not to talk about Helen's death too much.  I like the lady who plays Bessie in this version and I really and truly thought she did justice to the character in this part.  I still prefer the Masterpiece Theatre version, sorry I just do.  There are things that I like in both though, the actor who plays St. John was exactly what I thought of when I read the book, he was handsome but stern at the same time.  Oh, Mr. Brocklehurst was great too.  I like the fact that the mention the headmistress in this version as the reason for Jane's leaving Lowood School.  Its a good movie for a rainy afternoon.  I wish that they hadn't left it in episode format thought because that's rather tedious going through full credits every hour or so.  I thought that the cut off points were good however.  When she is in school however the clanging of that awful bell drove me to distraction.  I though it very good though, terribly eighties also, but I still watch eighties shows so who am I to point fingers.  :)
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I am so glad Disney re-did this movie! It looks great and there are great DVD features as well
B00000269M|3.0|This Record is O.K..... Nothing compares to \\"thriller\\".....\\"Dirty Dianna\\" is the high point. Other gthan that its just O.K.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|WE CAME ACROSS THIS MOVIE BY ACCIDENT WHILE WE WERE CAMPING & JUST LOVED IT SO WE CAME HOME & PURCHASED IT RIGHT AWAY.  IT'S SUCH CARING MOVIE ABOUT AN OLDER MAN WHO LIVES WITH HIS DAUGHTER, PLAYED BY SISSY SPACEK, WHO IS A LITTLE MENTALLY CHALLENGED.  IT TELLS OF HIS JOURNEY TO VISIT HIS BROTHER WHO HE HAD A FALLING OUT WITH SEVERAL YEARS BACK.  BECAUSE OF HIS YEARS & BAD EYESIGHT HE CAN'T DRIVE SO HE TAKES HIS JOHN DEERE LAWN MOWER TO DRIVE TO HIS BROTHERS HOUSE.  NO CURSE WORDS, JUST ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT YOU SAY \\"DARN, THAT WAS GOOD\\"
B000A2RRF4|2.0|This performance is allright...The guy is obviously a talented performer but it's really hard to get past that gold jock-strap thing. Who told him that was O.K.? I wish there was a video available from the \\"thriller\\" or \\"bad\\" tours....
0684857219|4.0|Arnold has covered the body building history and how to start training for competition. If your like me though, I bought this book for weight-training insights, pure and simple. And of course, the book delivers. Arnold has a great workout schedule and exercises that anyone novice or expert can use to their benefit. This book is full of information. Enjoy.
1582701709|2.0|This book does not live up to the hype it has received.  There was no \\"a-ha\\" moment ... just a bunch of \\"see it, believe it and it will come.\\"  Yeah ... right!!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|My entire family loves this movie and can't get enough!  I watched twice in one day just to enjoy a good, funny, clean, family friendly movie!  Our favorite character is by far, Tow Mater!
B0002YJ29O|5.0|I have never heard such an assembly of keyboard greats in such a magnificent<br /><br />endeavor as this.  There is nothing but perfection, musically and technically.  My favorites were the Bach Concerto for four keyboards and the Mozart Sonata for piano duet.  It would be so difficult to single out any one artist above the others.  Every true piano afficionado should treasure this one disc.
074356619X|5.0|It is an amazing audio cd to have. If you have ever seen the movie the secret it is twice as better than that. It gives so much more detail and helps you put the the into effect in your life.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig does an excellent job on presenting a new generation James Bond. I am British and grew up with the Bond Movies. No one ever seemed quite able to take the place of Sean Connery, there have been many pretenders to the throne! <br />However,Daniel Craig brought his own Bond into this movie, I was NOT disapointed, well done.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Peter Pan is a story for all children and adults to watch. It would be hard to imagine life without Wendy, John and Michael traveling with Peter to Neverland. Or that Trademark pixie Tinkerbell with her magic gold dust that makes the children fly. Add in a group of lost boys, and the legendary evil pirate Captain Hook, and you have a classic tale for life. This story has magic, pirates, and imagination beyond all belief.<br /><br />The two disc set is nice to have in your collection. Watch the second disc, its loaded with stuff.<br /><br />Stephen John Beccia<br /><br />author of The Treelanders
1594200823|3.0|Omnivore's Dilemma:  Intriguing and thought provoking. I enjoyed most of the book.  The book is divided into three parts, the first two being--for the most part--intriguing and thought provoking, and the third ...  The first part (Corn) is painstakingly investigative, with one face-slapping truth after another.  The second part (Grass) is the rational other extreme, with a skillful dichotomous flow from the preceding part.  The last part (Forest) ... well it closes far from it's beginnings.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|If your a floyd freak, this is what their all about!!!
0064410935|5.0|I never liked spiders and I've never been especially fond of pigs, but EB White's tall tale of Charlotte and Fern and Wilbur the Pig is and always will be one of the best books ever written. Why I don't classify this masterpiece as a children's book is because there's so many life lessons to be found in it, so many universal truths that this books should be mandatory reading for every person on the planet.<br /><br />I always cry at the end. The loss of friendship is something (once experienced) that will always affect the human soul. This is one of my very favorite children's books, but as I already said, it is also one of my favorite books of all time.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is one of the best pink floyd albums ever. I only hope they do it one more time.!!!
B000025H0Q|5.0|How in the friggin' hell can anyone give this album one star?!  Seriously - yeah, it's not in the typical melancholy, stark, just Nick-and-a-guitar mode, but you know what, if we're going to juxtapose it with everything else that's out there (not just Nick's other stuff) there is no way that this album deserves less than four stars.      Not that I am against the more melancholy Drake at all - \\"Pink Moon\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time - I love him when he is in that element and one has no musical ear if they fail to realize how brilliant and exacting his guitar playing is; but to say that his genius stops there is just not right.  I was in no way displeased with this album and consider it another Drake masterwork.  He sounds good in a happier mood.  Yes, it is a bit more produced than the others, but it's completely true to the nature of the album and it works perfectly as it is; I wouldn't change it at all or call it 'over'-produced, it's just 'more-produced'. Orchestral arrangements are done again by Cambridge friend Robert Kirby, who branched out a bit from \\"Leaves\\" to include brass and woodwinds.  However, in writing them he was ever-mindful of Nick's guitar; it serves as an anchor to all of the orchestration rather than completely obscuring it.  A bit more of a jazzy feel here (that, honestly, can get a bit loungy and dentists'-office-waiting-room at times, especially with the flute).
0790742780|5.0|A man pushed to the edge. But the way he finds a temporary reprieve from his situation...............is a roller coaster ride in itself. Michael Douglas steps out of his clean cut, do everything right image and what he does will leave you breathless...................
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The must wounder-full DVD I ever saw! I esspesialy admire the voilin player, a butterfly is what she is. My favorite song, I think, is At The Ceili.
0893860220|2.0|This is a book that must be trudged through.  Seemingly contradictory at times.  After a couple of chapters, I decided to wait a few years to attempt it.  A lot of assumptions that the reader is familiar with all sanskrit words, but even after being a \\"student\\" for over 30 years, there was much that left me in the dark. <br />Not much fun
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Like RV with Robin Williams it was funny, outrageous, different in every aspect (dysfuntional families), and heartwarming in the end.
0898159156|5.0|If you are going to buy one book to help you out with growing your carnivorus plants then this is it.  It is the number one best reference book to cultivating, caring, learning and just about anything else you want to know about carnivorous plants.  This book has been my bible and I never make any changes to my Carnivorous plant arrangments without consulting this book first.  This is the king of all Carnivorous plant books.  It has even made me want to take a trip from Phoenix, Arizona all the way to Sebastopol, California where this authors Carnivorous plant nursery is located.  Not to mention that Peter D'Amato's nursery is supposed to be the largest Carnivorous Plant nursery in the US.  If you are looking for a book then stop right now and choose this one.  You'll be glad you did.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|THE STRAIGHT STORY is a brilliant adaptation of the true story of Alvin Straight, a 73 year old man who made a (nearly) 300 mile trek, solo, on his John Deere lawnmower, to be reunited with his brother, for whom he had a bad parting of the waves.<br /><br />Richard Farnsworth plays the title character with quiet and meditative dignity, while Sissy Spacek give a wonderful, understated performance as his (slightly) retarded daughter, Rose.  On the course of his journey, which takes six weeks, Alvin encounters several kind people, and he touches their lives with his insight and wisdom.  It's hard to believe that director David Lynch, best known for twisted works, like BLUE VELVET and LOST HIGHWAY, brought such respectability and beauty to this little film, without being cynical or dark in the least bit.  What's more, it was beautifully shot and we see the rolling valleys and peaks, in Alvin's peripheral, as he travels along the dusty roads, and gazes up at the night sky to share his thoughts with the cosmos.  Richard Farnsworth earned an Oscar nomination, for this role, probably one of the most beautiful of his career.  Not to be missed......
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I am 52 years old and mostly listening to christian music these days because I am a christian, but also because there is not a lot of good clean \\"other\\" music for me to listen to. I love jazz and that soulful sound that reminds me of the 70's and 80's when I was younger. This young child (woman)is amazing ! If anybody has seen the music award shows or Oprah or turned on the radio lately you probably know that. I have bought the CD for a few people who also appreciate music that will minister to the soul. Corinne's voice is like that of an angel and we can expect her to go far. But, if she never does another CD, this one will stand the test of time.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This was the first James Bond movie I have ever watched and I loved it.  It had unbelievably great action scenes and suspense in it.  It was one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen and hope there is more of these to come with Daniel Craig starring as Bond.  I actually didn't want the movie to end!
B000N6TX1I|1.0|I used a free Blockbuster coupon on this movie and still feel ripped off--that's how bad this movie was. <br /> <br />I'm not much for politics in my movies. That said, I didn't mind the portrayals of liberals picketing, etc., I just tuned them out. They didn't bother me as they seemed to have bothered some of the folks reviewing this dog. This is just a poorly-done movie. The book must be better.  <br /> <br />Clive Owen just can't act; he dragged us through what little potential his casting offered, into the dreary discussiont of \\"is there anything on HBO tonight?\\". The plot was thin, and the ending somewhat \\"inconclusive\\". Most folks like a cut and dried \\"this is what happened\\" ending. That wasn't my objection. There wasn't enough of a storyline, coupled with high school drama-class poor acting, redundant violence, and a sorry dialogue. <br /> <br />I want my free coupon back. How do I recover 2 hours?
1582701709|1.0|I wish I was rich. I wish I could write a book, no I wish I knew famous people who say positive yet non-profound things. Next, I wish I could string their quotations all together.  I wish millions of people would buy my book and video, and wow (!), my wish comes true. I am positively happy and rich. This is an over-hyped book with content overshadowed by the mantra, \\"If you think it will happen, and it's a good thing, someday, someway, it will happen.\\" After all, people and the universe are \\"one\\" and share harmony through positive vibes.  Essentially, it is a stoic philosophy answering the question \\"how should people live?\\" Answer, \\"Seek happiness.\\" What's that? \\"Excellent activity of the soul.\\" Stoics believed a person could be happy even while suffering.  The book itself is a poorly assembled \\"director's cut\\" of her movie. In the end, it made me laugh because positive, wishful thinking is so much healthier than abundant whining.
0743298020|2.0|This book did not captivate me and made me wonder what all the 5 star reviewers have read previously. I enjoyed the beginning and the description of life in the bookstore. Other than that it it fell flat for me and was rather predictable. The twins needed a good spanking and maybe the author too.
B0001I562I|4.0|I have been looking for this movie for awhile and i am so glad to been able to purchase it.  Wonderful family movie.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|V825CLD <br /> <br />Put it in it cleans it up :) <br />My problem ended up being a loose wire. Glad I chose to open up the camera rather than toss it. Minimum labor cost more than the value of the camera. :( <br />It works like new now.  <br /> <br />Amazon was great, good price, quick shipping. Got it for less than it was selling for on Ebay too...
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I saw this film in an Art theatre before it became popular.  It is not a magic show (I am a Shrine Clown and magician), but rather a fascinating story that will have you applauding in the end.  DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT.!!!!  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, BUY IT NOW!
B000G0O5N2|4.0|This was a launch BR disc, so I didnt expect the best quality out there. Keep in mind, BHD in Blu Ray is fantastic. The quality is better, clearer, more contrast, sharper, etc...compared to standard DVD. But for the price I spent, I have to say I was a little disappointed. I bought the DVD for $4 used on Amazon. I got the BR version for $15 on Amazon. But I am a cheap person. For those who have a BR player, an HDTV, and dont have the DVD to BHD - this is a great pickup. For those who have the DVD, wait for a price drop on this.
B000MZHW40|5.0|I didn't get to see this movie in the Theatre, but I am glad I purchased it.  Fast action, great acting, good story kept me rivited to the screen. <br />Violence is a part of the story, but it is done extremely well and opened my eyes to a part of the world that I knew little about.  AAAAA++++
B00005LC1H|5.0|A very funny must have collection for those who remember watching this show on on the public broadcast channels
B00001ODGR|5.0|Styx still ROCK!!! This is a great concert, a must have for all Styx fans.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|This movie brings back the good ol' days! Granted, the storyline is kinda bland, but the writing for it is well placed. The voices fit all of the characters perfectly, along with the special cameo appearances by some big name actors. At first, I was a little disappointed when I heard they were making this into a CGI film a couple years ago, being that most CGI films I've seen, I didn't like at all in the slightest. The other problem is, I was worried that they were going to follow the FoxKids animated series, which had horrible voice acting, weird style of animation that didn't fit too well with the characters, and horrible one-liners that made me cringe. I went into this movie expecting to be bored, perhaps even walk out halfway through the film, like I did with Ice Age II. Well, I'm glad I didn't, because I left the movie theater with a big grin on my face mainly from the fact I was dead wrong about this film. I'm 25 years old now, and I might be biased, but when I was watching this movie, I really felt like I was 9 years old again, and it felt great! 5 Stars all the way!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I really liked Pierce Brosnan as Bond, but Daniel Craig did an excellent job.  This movie shows how Bond became Bond.  I don't want to give anything away, but the director has a list of expectations viewers have about Bond (ex: Bond always must have an awesome car), and uses that list to develop the story and the character by going away from these stereotypes.  Any Bond fan will love this movie.
1881273156|4.0|This is a small fast read with lots of good advice on how to show you love somebody and how to realise when your partner is showing you love in ways you didn't realize. I would say any couple who has some wires crossed in the love department should take the time to read this.
B000002O51|5.0|This is my third copy of this production over the years. Need I say more?<br /><br />Classic Boston sound. Brad Delp's soaring voice will be missed!
0783240287|4.0|The value of this DVD is great.  The brothers are a Motley Crew and the interaction of the Narrator is also original.  I do feel that some of the musicality and singing is compromised by the dubbing of some of the voices.  Also the soundtrack is more exciting than what we hear when watching the movie.  However, the stage settings are great and I really enjoyed the special feature of the history of Joseph.  You should not pay more than $15 for this DVD.. Making it a great value.
B00008G9JN|5.0|I bought the original while stationed in Iceland and the Wood sounds much better today. The song \\" Pibroch \\" reminds me of medival acid rock. Each song has it identify and flows freely.
B00015YVD6|4.0|This movie holds up good, and is timeless in so many ways. The DVD extras are resent and have background stuff you would not otherwise know about. Plus, that Daryl Hannah can swim like a fish.
B000M341QO|5.0|It's about time a movie came out that made you think. <br />Great acting!! <br />Loved it!!
B000002OR4|5.0|Most wonderful music ever written by John Williams, soothing, yet powerful.  The music can bring tears to your eyes and joy to your heart, at the same time.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I have to say I have always been a fan of THE WHO. One of my first memories was my aunt taking me to see TOMMY when I was about 7 years old. Ever since then I have been a major fan of THE WHO. I have to admit I never purchased the original version of Live at Leeds but had listened to it. I had various other albums they put out, particularly TOMMY and QUADROPHENIA - my favorites, but never got around to buying LIVE AT LEEDS. Once I saw this deluxe version available with the live version of TOMMY I bought it immediately. I now have listened to it at least 50 times if not more. It is one of the most powerful - adrenaline pumping collection of live music I have ever heard. The full version of TOMMY is incredible! The band never took a break between songs during the opera leading immediately into each song. As Roger Daltrey mentioned in an interview, The Who found their voice/style the first time they performed TOMMY live. Here we have a recording less than one year from the first live performance of TOMMY with all the power of a WHO performance in their youth and prime. I recommend this to any WHO fan. You won't be disappointed.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I'm not sure why this movie has been \\"banned\\" in the U.S.A. Maybe our Federal Censors, A.K.A. the Gubment, consider the premise to be controversial, mainly the Government policy of having children fight to the death. I'm not sure how far-fetched this really is; it's not much different than our Student Loan programs, but enough of my political opinions... <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE KICKS A**!!! The only thing I found annoying was having to read subtitles: They were able to dub English over Godzilla movies; why not do it here? Luckily, the dialogue isn't too deep, so if you find yourself simply watching the movie, and stop reading for a while, you can pretty much keep up with the plot. I do suggest you watch this movie with your surround sound system turned on; the audio portion is much better when loud.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor: Spend the $20 bucks to make this movie a part of your video library. I'm glad I did.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Was sent with the sound track, unfortunately it was not packaged very well and the CD case was cracked in a couple places, some bubble wrap would have been nice.  The DVD is fine, though.
0345308239|5.0|I had read two books by Barbara Tuchman prior to this one and was already one of her fans. With \\"The March of Folly\\" she outdoes herself. I am also mad at her for dying too soon, before she could enlighten us more. She illustrated perfectly in this book the stupidity, madness or folly that those on power are so prone to get. That, together with arrogance have caused a truly unbelievable amount of destruction and suffering to  billions throughout history, and up to this day. It seems that the lessons of the past are useless to those in power, and they are going to make the same mistakes over and over again. Barbara is in this book, the perfectly rational mind, dissecting folly like a surgeon. There are few like her that can analize so knowledgeably history and geopolitics at the same time. The last part of the book, about Vietnam, is a treasure of wisdom, because of obvious similitudes with current situations. Why is it that truly intelligent people like her almost never have a chance to be in a position of power? My conclusion is that the populace have a long way ahead before they know who to promote to power. And most governments through history are not too enthusiastic about a very educated and reasoning people.
B000N0W9WO|4.0|A beautiful transfer of a delightful film to Blu-ray and DVD. This film brings a breath of fresh air to the movies after the intensity of the several Oscar nominated movies this year. The cast is absolutely perfect and beleivable in this romantic comedy which intentionally or not contrasts life situations of two couples during the Holiday season in London and California. I think everyone will mark this movie as one of their new holiday favorites. I did!
B000JBWWRY|1.0|I recently bought Disney's Peter Pan DVD for my 3 year old son. I am a very protective parent and  do not allow my kid to watch just any kind of programming. Being Disney the reputed company that it is and given that is has a \\"G\\" rating, I blindly let my son watch this movie with its Spanish audio track, since my kid speaks Spanish only. To my surprise, it is full of racial slurs against native Americans and violent language content. It seems that Disney has edited the English audio track to make it \\"politically correct\\" and eliminating offensive content, while not doing so in the Spanish track. For example, in the scene where the kids and Peter Pan are talking about having happy thoughts, little boy John says (in the English track): \\"I think I'll be an Indian brave\\", while in the Spanish track it says: \\"Yo muchos indios voy a matar\\" (\\"I'm going to kill lots of Indians\\"). This is just an example of an array of violent language content included in this DVD. I lost count of how many times the word \\"kill\\"  comes up in this movie. No surprise that now my 3 year old is going around saying \\"I'm going to kill you\\" to anyone. This is an outrage and I wonder why English speaking kids deserve to be protected from this kind of language, and Spanish speaking kids don't. This is a terrible, terrible mistake. Disney is a company for kids everywhere in the world, no matter what language they speak. I am now weary of buying additional Disney movies for my son. As a mother I am deeply surprised, disappointed, and saddened by this fact.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|In 1984 or whenever, Michael Mann and Company invented a realm of pastels, grime, crime, and deco that captured the imagination of the world.  I can remember hitchiking across rural central Germany and drivers asking me where I was from in America.  \\"Miami,\\" I would say, to which the reply was, \\"Miami Vice.\\" I'd put on my Wayfarers and they'd say, \\"Don Johnson,\\" to which I would laugh, heartily.  Over the twelve years that I lived in Miami, reality began to emulate and improve on the \\"art\\" of Mann's creation.  What was mostly fiction in 1984 was mostly real by the time \\"Vice\\" left the air.  The 2006 release of \\"Miami Vice\\" is an homage to a style and a way of life found \\"only in Miami.\\"  Watching this film is almost as good as being there.  Thank you, Michael Mann. Your film is beautiful beyond words.
B000MM1F5A|5.0|If you like Mariza, if you like  the Fado, you will love this combination.  The CD is rich and pure, the DVD is wonderful, like being there. This may be the best yet Mariza , even with the applause....
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I bought this for a friend of mine for his birthday. I've never seen it but he says it's a great movie. I'll take his word for it!
074356619X|5.0|If you are looking for answers in your life - about anything - listen to this audio book!  Amazing piece of work.  It re-enforced everything I believed in and gave me support that is often hard to find in the world we live in.  Wonderfully written and exciting to listen to.  I am on my second listen at this time.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this CD!  It's like the Beatles, Elton John, and the Bee Gee rolled into one (with a little bit of the B52's sprinkled in there).  The songs are so different from each other and it's such an upbeat CD that I can't help but shake my booty each time I listen to it. It's definitely a mood lifter!
B000F1IQMS|5.0|THIS MOVIE SHOWS WHAT MAN KIND CAN DO TO EACH OTHER
B00005JPCF|5.0|I pre-ordered \\"Happy Feet\\" from Amazon for the English department at my school and we love it! Shockingly, it arrived faster than ever expected! It was brand new and in outstanding condition! Amazon is Awesome!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I've been a James Bond fan for years, but this film was so refreshing and exciting. The scene in Madagascar is one of the best chase scenes in movie history! Incredible. Seeing James evolve in this film was not only entertaining, but believable. Sometimes the stunts in Bond films are so out of reality that it's almost funny. In this film, you almost feel the pain of Bond and it's more realistic as he goes through both physical and emotional pain. While the ending could have been more drawn out, the film is an instant classic. Well worth the price to own. A must for any action film collector.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Not everyone I watched it with or spoke to about it liked this movie but I'm a big Ben Stiller fan and I thought this spoof on male models was hilarious! I guess it just depends on your sense of humor!
0823016285|5.0|The author and artist did a superb job in explaining the theory of emotion, and then his actual drawings provide an excellent guide to these basic emotions. This is a rare and unique combination.
B000NA28I4|3.0|Imagine the plot of Star Wars set in Middle Earth, with the Dragon Riders of Pern substituted for the Jedi and you've got \\"Eragon\\" in a nutshell.  Yes, Eragon rips off these great fantasy classics big-time.  Yes, many fans of the book think this film is more abomination than adaptation.  But if all you're looking for is an entertaining way to spend a couple hours, Eragon should fit the bill.  Good special effects and engaging performances make up for some of the plagiarism, and the result is at least fairly diverting.    The performances are pretty good, though the characters are fantasy genre cliches (by the way, I DARE you not to laugh when John Malkovich says \\"I suffer without my stone\\").  The character of Arya, however, seems miscast, and looks to be about 10 years older than Eragon, her potential love interest.    A pleasant bit of sword-and-sorcery fluff, \\"Eragon\\" rates three stars.
0596101996|5.0|Comprehensive reference, not overly technical yet not wanting for detail. I've checked out numerous books from numerous local libraries and even bought some only to sell or give them away after a few weeks. After studying this book i can say this is a resource i will wear out.
B000E41MS6|5.0|My family recently discovered Dr. Who by chance and was quickly hooked. We had not seen any of the original shows, only parts of Series 2 and were somewhat hesitant about a \\"different doctor.\\" Series 1 was outstanding! Now we can't decide which Doctor we like better. We had to force ourselves to watch only one episode at a time so that we could spread the pleasure out. Season 1 is very well written, acted, and produced. I cannot believe that it is a children's show; it can be enjoyed on many levels. I enjoyed the gradual unfolding of the relationship between Rose and the Doctor and also the frequent glimpses into the Dr.'s complex emotions. The series sets the framework for several recurring themes and characters making it a must for people like us who are new fans. I also enjoy that the show has no bad language, and minimal, subtle sexual content. The overall message of a \\"better way to live\\" is a great thing to share with your family; a nice contrast to the narcissism prevelent in so much modern entertainment.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This movie is every bit deserving of the 5 stars.  very well made with a good message if you look deep into.  Rather than promoting child violence, you leave this movie with the feeling of how awful it is.  The way things are portrayed in this movie show how awful violence can be.  Wonderfully made with an excellent story.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is a great Bond film and a satisfying reset to the franchise. However, I can't believe it got a PG-13 rating. This is a very violent film with some disturbing images of death and torture - much grittier than previous Bond outings and far more reminiscent of Flemming's novels. IMO, it should have received an R. Be that as it may, if you're a Bond fan, I suspect you'll love Casino Royale.

B00005JPLU|5.0|I saw it in IMAX. I had to. And you should see it that way, too, if you have the chance. If not, watch it at your friend's house - the one with the awesome home theater system. You might wonder why seeing it in IMAX was such a big deal when there were intentional cinematic techniques used to blur the screen - why do we need to see that more clearly in IMAX? You don't. But IMAX also offers superior sound. And if you really want to experience this movie, you need to be able to get lost in the sound.  <br /> <br />As far as epic war-movies are concerned, this is not the most original. If you try to make the comparisons to the great movies in this genre, you will be off base. 300 was not made to compete with the storylines of Braveheart or Gladiator. There were even many things borrowed from those two movies. Ignore that. 300 was a set of books, well a set of graphic novels (there is an important distinction), by Frank Miller which he wrote as his adaptation of the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC. His adaptation. That means if you try to analyze the movie from a historcal standpoint...again, you've missed the mark. <br /> <br />Frank Miller's Sin City was popular enough that it would seem movie makers became interested in his other work. And comic book movies have been so popular lately, why not try graphic novels?  <br /> <br />Here is where I draw the line between comic books and graphic novels: In comic books, people die. In graphic novels, often times you watch it happen. The word \\"graphic\\" was not chosen by accident. I am generalizing, but I think my point can be summed up that way. And it is not always violence, but there is a greater degree of grown-up content. If comic books are PG or even PG-13, Graphic Novels are R or sometimes NC-17.  <br /> <br />Without that understanding, more people will want to see 300 than maybe should - ladies, I'm looking in your direction (and again, I am generalizing). It looks like an exciting movie about a few battles with 300 menin peak physical condition. Oh, and there is an incredible amount of (computer-generated) blood shed.  <br /> <br />There was a lot of shouting and Spartan pride. Some people feel that this was overly repetative and glossed over the genius of the movie, but many times I even found myself laughing slightly maniacally (out loud) at different action sequences and taunting comments made by the 300.  <br /> <br />I could not help the feeling of primitive energy that coursed through my body. Don't blame me. Blame 300. Or better yet, celebrate 300. Go see it and enjoy it as much as I did.  <br /> <br />Back when I played high school football, the night before gameday we would meet at one kid's house and either watch the end of Braveheart or The Program to spike our adrenaline. If only 300 had been available then... <br />

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have been a Bond fan from the beginning, and must agree with several other reviewers that Craig is the best Bond since Connery. He brings a toughness and believability to the role which has been missing for a long time. Real secret service operatives who do what Bond does are often ex-military special forces types, not dandies who worry about whether their martinis are shaken or stirred. This hard edge comes through in many of Ian Fleming's books: Casino Royale captures that tone, as did the early  Bond films with Connery. Many of the other films with Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan seem almost cartoonish by comparison.

0143038419|4.0|I had high hopes for this book after Julia Roberts recommended it in an article that I read...it fell a little short of my expectations, but not too far.  While I loved Gilbert's writing style and her sense of humor, I did find some parts to be a little repetitive and whiny.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first segment on Italy (it really made me want to go there!), was less enthralled with India (although this is where she discovers true spirituality, I think this section dragged on and on and on), and was pleasantly surprised by Indonesia ( a place where the joy and humor seemed to re-enter Gilbert's writing).  All in all, it's a book I would recommend - not as a self-help manual, as some have suggested - but as an entertaining memoir that draws attention to several universal truths.
B000JVT09C|2.0|This movie was a huge let down. It goes from good picture quality to bad back and forth the entire movie. Its hard to believe that a new movie would be released with such bad quality. This should be a $16 movie not a $22+.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|This album, along with current albums by Kings of Leon and Modest Mouse, has renewed my faith that rock can still be a memorable, exciting, and thought provoking medium that can lift my spirit to the heights.  The hypnotic melodies draw me back again and again to this recording.  It is a mature achievement in conceptualization and, as far as I'm concerned, is worthy to take its place among the classic conceptual albums such as Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, and whatever other albums you may personally feel belongs in that list.  I am a 61 year old man and find much of modern music rather vapid and stylistic such as Panic and the Disco and Fall Out Boy.  I just do not relate to these type of bands probably because of age but every so often an album like Neon Bible enlivens my love of rock n' roll and I hope these type of artists never give up trying to return rock to the glories it once enjoyed.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|Ok... there is no doubt this is one heck of a show that I have ever seen. Just like many of us, I am after purchasing the video. What I am confused about is that the normal DVD format contains a set of 5 DVD and many uncut content that was not shown on Discovery. However, when I looked into the HD-DVD version, there are only 4 DVD and does not mentioned anything about additional content. Am I missing something?
6305841861|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it when I was 17, and I love it even more now. The main character, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell, is iconic in his hilarious idiocy. The creatures are lovely, the plot is very entertaining, and lots of people die in creative ways, and/or are tormented by an evil detatched hand. Don't watch this movie expecting complete slasher action, though. The blood content is high, but the direct gore factor is much lower than in the first one (and fortunately, there are no tree-rapes). I also recommend watching the behind-the-scenes mini-film, \\"The Gore the Merrier,\\" for an entertaining look at what went into the film. Fans of the series will definately enjoy this film (I actually saw \\"Army of Darkness\\" first, and worked my way back). Also, fans of actor Bruce Campbell, or director Sam Raimi will enjoy this film. Also, if you're a hard-core Ted Raimi fan (like I am), you'll probably enjoy watching him struggle around in a full monster body suit as the possessed Henrietta (the poor thing). All in all, a great horror movie, with more than a bit of dark comedy, and all around great fun to watch.

6301792734|5.0|The original Star Wars trilogy will always stand in first place for my sci-fi loving heart, when it comes to classic, wonderfully told space adventure. The special effects were groundbreaking at the time, and today, are just as powerful, though we would do them differently now. The characters are multi-dimensional, and the story of good vs. evil is masterfully played out. For anyone who loves sci-fi, this needs to be at the top of the list.
B00007GZR5|4.0|This movie is one of if not the best examples of the bond real love can make that has ever been put on film
B000M5AJQS|2.0|How Scorsese won for this and not Goodfellas is beyond me.  Unless it was a \\"make-up\\" Oscar.  This movie tries too hard to be like other movies.  From the beginning long shot with Nicholson voice-over to the Joker-esque facial musings, Matt Damon sounding like he just stepped off the Good Will Hunting set, it was just kind of sad.  There's some spirited acting but that didn't help the story.  There was nothing scary or disturbing about this picture.  Maybe I'm just desensitized but Marty should have stopped at Casino.

1586210912|4.0|I listened to this on audio CD. The advice is sound, but I frequently wanted to hustle the story along to get to the point. The author uses a story form comparing advice about money handling from his own dad, who was relatively poor, and conflicting advice from his best friend's dad, who became wealthy.<br />He points out that US schools educate us for careers, but never teach us what to do with the money we make. We become slaves to our jobs with the paycheck, mortgage, and our poor spending habits keeping us trapped.<br />He explains how to make your money work for you and reminds us that indulging ourselves beyond our means will result in money problems throughout our lives.

1582701709|5.0|After empirically testing several of the theories put forth in this book, I can assert, without reserve that \\"Secret\\" is the single, most transformative read I have ever experienced, and I have experienced innumerable volumes. I highly recommend it, but only to those willing to enjoy peace, joy, love, and abundance in all facets of their lives. \\"Secret\\" is a quantum leap to a new reality, one that is infinitely more rewarding to what is presented on the evening news. Amazing! Joyous! A caviar for the spirit and caveat of the soul!

B00005JLWN|2.0|Equilibrium is a curate's egg - its best parts are not good throughout, and its worst aspects make erratic appearances. The acting is really the least of its problems; the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up.<br /><br />Equilibrium, however poorly, aspires to be a dystopian film, and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike. Such a formula was employed magnificently in Michael Radford's adaptation of George Orwell's 1984. Contrarily, films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by Alfonso Cuaron's junky adaptation of P.D. James' The Children of Men. There are essentially three parts to this formula. First, there must be a depiction of a believable society, and plausible justifications for its existence. The author or script writer must paint vividly, yet remain nuanced, since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer, without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it. Second, two-thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist, which formally unveils the ethical dilemma. Here, the protagonist offers his alternative, usually an acknowledgement of the humane. Third, the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist's choice: he must surrender to the system, rebel against it, or be conquered by it. The ending, if it is not tragic in the classical sense, must be ambiguous; if it is ended happily, it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers' thoughts: the problem has been resolved, and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it.<br /><br />Libria, the society depicted in Equilibrium, is a post-apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings, and the actions carried out on their behalf, represent the fons et origio of man's inhumanity to man. The objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace. Is this believable? Ultimately, it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist, no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved. However, a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war, and aversion is something we principally feel. A more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings, but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent. The protagonist (John Preston, a member of the Grammaton Cleric, an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so-called `sense-crimes') marries, begets children, hesitates in killing his partner - what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling? And, if we are being generous, and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say, \\"You can never entirely eliminate feeling,\\" it fails still; because if the denizens of Libria weren't completely devoid of feeling, they couldn't be as cowed as they are depicted. Instead, countless times throughout the film characters make comments, statements, enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion. To have had characters who were truly apathetic, or for whom the fictitious drug Prozium was effective, they would have had more in common with Star Trek's Borg. The backdrop for this dystopia, then, lacks subtlety or nuance. From the first fifteen seconds of film, the viewer ethically objects - it remains tediously Manichean throughout. The viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen.<br /><br />In Brave New World, it is Mustapha Mond's conversation with John the Savage. In 1984, it is O'Brien's talk with Winston Smith. In The Children of Men, it is a debate between Theo and the Xan. In Equilibrium, the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout, culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the Matrix three years before. Here was the moment for the \\"talky\\" bit of the film, the sophisticated counter-punch, the moral awakening, the vindication of the human; instead, the viewer is given another low-brow, Hollywood denouement. John Preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo - there is no bit of dialogue with Father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that \\"Feelings are essential to thought,\\" or that \\"peace has been obtained at a terrible price.\\" All the loose ends, littered liberally throughout the film, are never addressed: Why have art in Libria? Why does Father intonate, and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film? A better film would have acknowledged these scenes, and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between John Preston and Father (or DuPont as it turns out).<br /><br />The conclusion of Equilibrium can be summarized as follows: \\"Good guy kills bad guys, sixty-second revolution ensues, people can feel again, hero smiles, time to go to bed.\\" There wasn't ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway: what was wrong was obviously wrong, and what was right was intuitively right. The viewer never believed the reasons Libria came to be, or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found Huxley's, Orwell's, James', Zamyatin's, or Koestler's explanations. In Equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal, unoriginal action movie to follow. The plot, then, was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft-core porn films: they needn't be sensical because no one is interested in the story, but rather for the titillation, arousal, and amusement. Many viewers of Equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences (a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest); but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience, Equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment. During the film a woman asks Preston, \\"Why are you alive?\\" Preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer, \\"I'm alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society. To serve Libria.\\" \\"It's circular. You exist to continue your existence. What's the point?\\" she asks. And, what's the point is exactly the point about this film.before.

B000068FWC|5.0|You should know that it is nearly impossible for me to review this album. So great is my love for this classic that I can only find good things to say about it, and 'review' implies that one is at least partially impartial. How's that for a contradiction in terms? Well, let's get crackin', shall we?     This album has been a part of my life since the first time I switched on the radio in 1979 and heard 'Goodbye Stranger' pouring forth from the tinny speakers of my sisters' transistor. (If I ever started a band I believe I would call it Sisters' Transistor. 'S got a ring to it, don't you agree?) I have owned this in every format it was made available in, with the exception of 8 track, as I was too young to own an 8 track player before they were discredited and laughed off the face of the earth. These tunes have permeated my subconsciousness to such an extent that when I pop this disc in and hit Play I am instantly transported to the late 70s, just as if no time had passed at all. Just as if I could simply call up my buddies and we'd trudge down to Kovac's for a Marathon bar once again. This isn't so much music as it is nostalgia, but I confessed from the outset that I'm not an impartial judge of this recording!    'Gone Hollywood' makes it clear that Supertamp viewed American culture with wry and witty bemusement at best. The previously mentioned 'Goodbye Stranger' features the finest example of whistling to ever appear in pop music coupled with an unforgettable hook, and 'Just Another Nervous Wreck' should have served as an anthem for Underdogs everywhere. If only music this intelligent and durable were still in high demand now! 'Breakfast In America' stands as a snapshot of a vanished musical milieu, but like all genuine classics it transcends it's time and place in order to delight the ears of music lovers of all places and all centuries.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is the first Bond movie since \\"You Only Live Twice\\" (the last of Connery's \\"good\\" Bond movies) that didn't bore me witless - I basically threw in the towel after that one.  The producers and writers hit on exactly the right strategy here: showing Bond on the way up, still a bit raw, and displaying an edge of savagery that gives his choice of career some context.  Craig hits the right note bang on the nose: edgy, his cocky self-assurance actually a drawback rather than an asset to his job, still learning the ropes, and complicated.  And, despite performing the usual complement of nonsensical physical feats, he manages to remain human.  The difference between Craig's Bond and Connery's Bond is that Craig is playing an extraordinary man, while Connery was playing a ridiculously unreal one.  Connery, through sheer intelligence and physical magnetism, brought the unreal man to some sort of life; Craig brings the extraordinary man to life.  The Bonds in between don't count, and that includes Pierce Brosnan.  There are no other Sean Connerys - his was a unique persona in a unique physical package.  Trying to find another one was a pointless exercise.  Craig, by contrast, is not remotely handsome, but he's very hot, a product not of the arrangement of his features but of his controlled intensity, conveyed in the first black and white fight scenes of the movie.  Although there are plenty of Pretty People onscreen, it was a relief not to be hit over the head with an endless parade of also ridiculously unreal women falling into Bond's arms like clockwork.  The plot actually held some interest on its own, and the required action scenes were - well, just as they should be.    The rest of the cast is also fine, including the Danish actor Mads Mikkelson as the villain. My one complaint is that the sound was a bit problematic.  I often lost the second halves of sentences.  This was particularly true of Eva Green, who appeared to be trying to pitch her voice to a very low and throaty timbre.  The result was that half the time I couldn't understand what she was saying.  This happened with the rest of the cast, too, but more often with her.    The final frames of the film were delicious, as the old (that is to say the \\"future\\") Bond theme creeps into the score - a nicely done bit of foretelling.  I found myself grinning.  A terrific film and congratulations to all hands.

B000KX0IOK|3.0|HALF NELSON is a bit of a conundrum. It has something fresh at its core and a stellar performance from lead actor Ryan Gosling (it earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor last year), but the story is so loose and vague (especially the ending) that it will drive many watchers to distraction.<br /><br />The freshness comes from the fact that this isn't a story about some great white hero coming to a downtrodden, black school in order to lift their educational spirits and thus their chances of breaking out of the drug ring mold so often affiliated with this genre (see THE PRINCIPAL or DANGEROUS MINDS as prime examples). This is the story of a teacher named Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) who's drug problems spill out of his personal life and into his professional one. This is noticed one day by one of his students named Drey (Shareeka Epps), a thirteen-year-old who's in Dan's history class and part of the school's girls basketball team, which he coaches.<br /><br />Dan's teaching-life begins to show cracks as he rambles off on inane topics during class and eventually, in a more physical manner, when his nose starts bleeding spontaneously.<br /><br />Drey has issues of her own, trying to deal with a brother who's in prison (for selling drugs), a mother who works so much that she's turned her daughter into a latchkey kid, and the advances of a local drug runner named Frank (Anthony Mackie, FREEDOMLAND), who wants to use Drey as one of his delivery folks. All of these things pull at Drey and we see her struggle to understand why the world around her is so terrible and how someone she's looked up to (her teacher) could be a part of it.<br /><br />Both Dan and Drey try to save each other in their own way, too. Drey by waiting for her teacher after school so that she can distract him from his self-destructive ways, and Dan by confronting Frank and asking him to leave Drey alone.<br /><br />Gosling's performance of a drug-addled and lost soul is spot-on. His win at the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Actor was well deserved, as was his Academy Award nomination. Young Shareeka Epps plays well beside the towering Gosling but wasn't quite up to his level.<br /><br />The big letdown, however, was the loose reins of the story as a whole. We never witness what happens to Gosling's character at the school after a substitute comes to replace him (we might assume that he went into a recovery program or was fired from his job or both, but we don't know; he may also have just quit in order to save his students from his destructive behavior but, again, we just don't know).<br /><br />The ending sequence is interesting if, again, a bit too vague. We're not privy to what becomes of Gosling and Epps' characters. They're left sitting on a sofa staring at the camera, making one believe that either things aren't going to change or that great changes await them. Which it is is anyone's guess.His win at the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Actor was well deserved, as was his Academy Award nomination.

B000NA28IE|4.0|The movie had something for everyone. There was the touching bond between Dragon and Rider yet there was plenty of action to keep it fun. There was even Magic to keep you guessing and a happy yet undefined ending leaving room for a sequel.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|Altho there are some good action scenes in Casino Royale, and Daniel Craig is an excellent actor with an interesting face, he does not convince (this viewer at least) as Bond. In fact he behaves more like a Jimmy Bones than a James Bond. This is largely due to the silly 'soft centre' of the plot, Bond's love for Vesper Lynd. Eva Green, who plays the character, often looks beautiful but lacks appeal, sexual or otherwise, and their exchanges are mechanical, totally lacking in the kind of chemistry that should exist between two people attracted to each other, or who are antagonistic.  <br />The best Bonds are still Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan.  <br />I was a little surprised when the dvd began with previews, which is to say, ads, of other movies before going into the main feature. Wish it didn't.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is yet another great Bond film.  The action and cinematography are stunning.  Casino Royale seems to be a little more tragic than some of the other Bond films, as it deals with how Bond got his start, and how he developed as a person.  I loved the urban running scene in the beginning of the movie, and Daniel Craig fits in well with some of the other Bond greats.   <br /> <br />My only complaint was that the movie slows down considerably at the end, and although most of what it shows is important, I felt that the pacing could have been better. <br /> <br />However, overall, this is an absolutely wonderful film.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Loaded with superstars, Love Actually is an enjoyable, funny romantic comedy.  It's definitely entertaining but lacks substance.  Yes there are serious bits intended to tug at the heart strings, but they're all but swallowed by the comedy.  At the risk of sounding anti-American -- I'm quite the opposite -- much of this film's charm is that it's very British.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, there's quite a bit of Four Weddings and a Funeral in Love Actually.  It follows that same formula.  If you're looking for something fresh and original, this film's not it.<br /><br />Others might chide me for being prudish, but some of the nudity and adult language, especially the cursing by young Sam, was entirely unnecessary.  Some of it, though, was  funny.  No matter how you feel about that sort of stuff, the movie's probably not suitable for younger viewers.<br /><br />This is a movie that both men and women can enjoy, especially if you're looking for something light-hearted.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|This movie ain't that great. The only innovative part of the whole movie was when Jamie Foxx flew in an Adam Air (is that correct?) very light airplane only feet behind another small airplane while working undercover to create the 'cloaking' effect and fool the radar screens in South Florida. Much of the rest of the movie wasn't innovative at all-like when Tubbs and this underworld criminal sneak into Cuba by boat (uh huh yeah right) and then hang out in a bar and order drinks with funny slang Spanish-language names. It doesn't even look like Cuba it looks like a cardboard prop! They spent $125 million making this? This movie lacks the thumping music from the TV show as well. When I say 'innovative' this movie was nowhere near as innovative as Michael Mann's 10 years earlier 'Heat' [[ASIN:B00000JGHM Heat]] Heat was truly a landmark movie the music and all. Miami Vice barely lasted a week when it hit the Dollar theaters in Texas. AWFUL MOVIE!

B000N6TX1I|5.0|This film is a technical marvel.  I don't mean technical as in \\"George Lucas technical\\" where there's a big green screen and lots of FX.  I mean the cinematography, the mathematics of the shots, all of it is quite brilliant.  The director has made a minimal amount of cuts in this film, and the result is long, realistic shots, intricately choreographed and rehearsed.  The military sequences at the end are as complex, stark, and captivating as Saving Private Ryan.  The \\"car mob\\" scene is an amazing technical feat (watch the bonus features to see what they had to do to get a camera inside of the car for a long, complex, stunt-filled scene). <br /> <br />People in other reviews are claiming Owen's acting is bland.  His acting is spot on; he plays a defeated man in a defeated world, and he's just trying to wake up to the possibility of hope as the film progresses.   <br /> <br />The sets and design are superb as well, showing a very realistic future, bleak though it may be. <br />The film is a great study of foreground versus background as well (philosopher Slavoj Zizek says this the bonus features, but you're sure to notice before you get to him).  In normal, mundane scenes you can relate to, something disconcerting and shocking is typically in the background.  The film always draws you in with the comfortable and makes you squirm a little with the bleak future existing all around the scene. <br /> <br />One final note is that the bonus features are amazing.  I typically hate bonus sections and watch a few uneven deleted scenes and eject the disk.  These, however, are smart and illuminate the literature of this film.  There are great looks the this future, politics, and some world renown philosophers weigh in on the issues.   <br /> <br />I must admit I've yet to read the book (it's in my shopping cart right now).  But as a film standing by itself, this is a must-see.  If you're looking for a sci-fi pic with car chases and kung fu, got with Bruckheimer.  If you want a cerebral, gritty, unflinching look at a sterile future, this is the film for you.

1847370292|5.0|Have you ever had a moment when you couldn't get a negative thought out of your head and it seemed that the more and more you thought about it the more the negativity built up inside you? If you answered yes to this question and you are a genuine person with integrity, a burning desire for life and are tired of the negativity that surrounds us all every day then this book is for you. <br /> <br />From the start of reading this book I have felt positively charged as if nothing bad can effect me. My outlook on my personal realationships and life in general has changed for the better. I have always read \\"self help\\" books that have touched on the idea that thinking negatively causes the negative to happen. This book teaches from the opposite angle and better yet how to control it. After reading this it also got me thinking about things like prayer and the \\"frequency\\" that it works on. That is not to say that this book is relegious by any means, it's just what it got me thinking about. <br /> <br />If you need and want to feel good and have good things happen to you then this book will teach you in the ways of the secret. You can make it happen and just ignore any of the negative reviews that some may leave. You get what you think about.
1400032717|4.0|I worked in the Special Education class at our local high school for several years.  While there, I was involved with many different autistic kids.  None of them were alike.  I always wished that I could understand the way they thought so that I could help them better.  This book, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is great.  I felt that I was truly seeing the world through the eyes of an autistic boy.   <br /> <br />There are times while reading this book that I just wanted to cry out \\"Tell them (the cop, the lady, ect) the whole story, you are not explaining yourself!\\" It is frustrating and that is exactly the way if feels when one is around autistic children.  Their thought processes are very unique and this was well demonstrated in the book.   <br /> <br />I believe that you will love this book for several reasons.  It is not like any other book you will read and Mark Haddon does a great job of putting us inside the head of an autistic boy.  The author has had a lot of experience with disabled children and it shows.  The story line has a surprise to it and some unusual twists. While the thought processes of autism are confusing, the book was well organized and yet let you feel what it must be like to have this disorder.  Very enjoyable, fast read, interesting and mildly exciting.
1401302378|2.0|I found it amazingly redundant, but the information fascinating.  I do think it was probably better left as a magazine article then a book, but I don't regret reading it.  I wouldn't think it worth paying for though.
B00005JKGO|5.0|Considered by many to be Federico Fellini's masterpiece, \\"La Dolce Vita\\" is a nearly 3-hour long film that's low on plot; But is, without a doubt, a masterpiece. The film marks the first collaboration between Fellini and actor Marcello Mastroianni (who also appeared in \\"8 1/2\\"). <br />\\"La Dolce Vita\\" claimed the Palme D'or at the Cannes Film Festival and feels surprisingly modern, especially since it's 46 years old.  <br /> <br />Mastroianni plays Marcello, a gossip columnist who lives the nightlife, scoping out various clubs and hangouts while getting dirt on various celebrities. This movie is what gave the world the term \\"paparazzi.\\" In truth, the word \\"paparazzi\\" is never used, but \\"paparazzo\\" is uttered many times. Anyway, the plot doesn't follow a linear line of events. Instead, we follow Marcello on what amounts to a series of episodes almost like on a TV show. He meets a woman (Anouk Aimee), with whom he spends the night at a prostitute's house. We see his relationship with his suicidal girlfriend. We watch him meet the Swedish actress Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), lust for her but never actually get her. We watch as he goes to see a supposed sighting of the Madonna. Then as he visits an old friend...Despite being 174 minutes, I'm finding myself at a loss of words over the actual plot. That's one of the great things about a Fellini film though, the spontaneity.  <br /> <br />The script is written by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Tullio Pinelli...To me, the biggest influences on the film are Fellini and Pasolini. It's got Fellini's mood and atmosphere; anyone could recognize it as a Fellini film. However, unlike \\"La Strada\\" or \\"Nights of Cabiria\\" it has that same pacing, slowness that looms over Pasolini's \\"Salo\\" and \\"Teorema.\\" The title la dolce vita translates to \\"the sweet life.\\" The title fits the film so well. Throughout the film, we watch the hopeless protagonist Marcello search for the sweet life. By the end of the film, he has realized thatthere's no such thing. If you put this film in-between \\"La Strada\\" and \\"8 1/2\\" you realize something strange. \\"La Strada\\" has a childish innocence to it, \\"La Dolce Vita\\" has a young man transitioning into a world-weary state, and then \\"8 1/2\\" has that world-weary man in the form of a director. It's interesting to notice; these three films play almost as a trilogy. This is a 5 star film all the way, a fact that owes thanks to the score by Nino Rota. I don't know anyone who could compose a Fellini film the way Rota could. \\"La Dolce Vita\\" is a masterpiece. It's long, but it's worth it. <br />GRADE: A- <br />

B00000IYWH|5.0|\\"Elvis Is Back\\"...is one of the most appropriate titles of any album ever made.....back from the army and ready to reclaim his place at the top of the charts..Elvis shows that his 2 years in the army weren't spent marching and peelin potato's...he's back with a newfound vengeance..and an amazingly more rich and sophisticated vocal style. I could go through the song-by-song, but it suffices to say that he cements old ground on tracks like \\"make me know it\\", pushes the envelope on \\"such a night\\" with it's highly suggestive moanin, and groanin, of a one night stand.Then put's the Bobby's and Frankies away with \\"girl of my best friend\\"....but! the piece de resistance is his flawless version of \\"reconsider baby\\"..this album is probably his best!

1402573219|5.0|A seemingly normal family consisting of 2 parents and 3 children is faced with making life-and-death decisions that no family should have to make.  Each member is, at times, pitted against another and then, just as quickly, finds him/herself supporting that same person as circumstances shift and awareness dawns on each person at different times and in different ways.  The writing is beautiful, descriptive, emotional, and brutally honest in the context of this difficult topic.  <br /> <br />The main characters take turns narrating the story, so a single situation is often seen from multiple perspectives.  This makes it easier for the reader to understand each character's position, but much more difficult to deem any character \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"...which seems to be our typical inclination in any adversarial situation.  As readers move through the story, they will experience love-hate relationships with all of the characters, making it hard to determine who's right and who's wrong and, ultimately, leading the reader to question his/her automatic tendency to dissect even the most complex situations into such simplistic parts and pieces. <br /> <br />This book is a great read that engages both the reader's heart and mind.  At the least, it is an enjoyable way to pass the time; at the most, it may actually change how the reader perceives controversial or adversarial situations by making it a little more difficult to assign fault or blame without knowing or considering the \\"whole story.\\" <br /> <br />
B000H4TX9I|5.0|If you are reading this review you probably already know that Firefly is perhaps the best modern sci-fi series ever produced.  It is without doubt captures the best elements of the genre - drama, suspense, comedy and even a hint of the romantic. Expertly written and cast.  This series will leave you wondering how a network could ever cancel a program that is this good.  This show compares favorably with anything on TV today.  I urge you to do yourself a favor and give Firefly a chance. You will be glad you did.

B000MXPE7O|5.0|It is very difficult to be impartial with this film: either you love it or you despise it. Almost three hours long, complex plot, no action, low key characters ... The movie reminded me a lot the early John Le Carre books. A story about the real lives of the spies. <br /> <br />If you come to this work expecting to be easily entertained, I guess this movie is not for you. This is no Bond/Bourne flick. No glamour here, although there are plenty of stars. No likeable characters. No special effects. No cheap baits to atract audiences. <br /> <br />For me, however, the way the life of the spy is narrated by De Niro is fascinating. Since his childhood, Edward Wilson's character is forged through extreme, even dramatic, decisions. From his father death to the love of his life, not forgetting the death of his mentor. Tough choices modelling a person who, apparently, never hesitates. Regretless. A man quietly merciless with his enemies, colleagues and wife. America over all with one only weakness: his son. A study of ethics under an apparent dull and grey existence. <br /> <br />Plot and direction are inmaculate. Good acting. Superb cinematography. <br /> <br />One last comment: although I reckon that this is a movie for minories, I cannot understand Amazon editorial review by Jae-Ha Kim. It shocks me how far he is from the target (understanding what is being narrated). It misleads potential viewers. The movie is excellent, the best I've seen in the last year. As I said before, if you liked John Le Carre Smiley's books, this one is for you.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  There is nothing undone, left out, or unfinished.  Sylvester Stallone brings back to life the heart and spirit of Rocky as no one else can do.  All the love, faith, hope, desire, and raw guts are presented in this film to stir the heart and inspire the soul for a life time.  Growing up with the Rocky films, I found this one to be particular dear to my heart and soul because, reaching middle age, this picture shakes up the indominable spirit within to remind me (us) that it ain't over till it's really over.  Sly does all his stunts and choreography in the fight scenes plus brings in some spontaneous adrenalin filled punches that has him and opponent going at it.  There is bonus features like the stuff behind the scenes including boxing sparing and Sly's weight lifting routines which would normally kill other people.  The movie makes no pretenses, and does not try to make an old guy look young like so many other movies do when they have old stars come back with their hair dyed and gut sucked in.  No, in this movie, Rocky IS Rocky, a guy in his sixties, gaunt, beat up and wracked by life's  pounding, but full of heart, courage and a rekindled fire.  This movie isn't about an old guy trying to prove himself to the world but about a fighter who rediscovers himself, revisting himself back to his roots as a fighter, and doing the only thing he knows how to do and what he was made to do- fight!  In fact, there are no villians in this movie as we see that both Rocky and his opponent, Mason Dixon (a real professional boxer by the name of Antonio Tarver) are driven and motivated for different reasons which leads them to the final battle field of the boxing ring.  Sly did it again and did it well. Great writing, great casting, great directing and acting, this is one of the best movies out there ever.  This is unfortunately the final chapter in the Rocky series - unfortunately the final bookend.  Wish it weren't so!
0060855924|5.0|This is truly an inspired piece of writing. Right from the first page where we are introduced to A'Tuin the Great, to the last page where Rincewind the failed wizard is for the umpteenth time facing certain death, I was enthralled and entertained and left begging for more.<br /><br />Consider the brilliance of the conception of Discworld itself: A world that is flat, where if you get to close to the edge you fall off, where the sun and moon orbit the world, where Gods are real, have character and flaws and are constantly competing with each other. A world that is full of Dwarves, Trolls, Wizards, Heroes, Witches, Tyrannical Despots, Thieves, Assassins and Monsters of all descriptions. A world that is supported on the back of Berilia, Tubul, T'Phon and Jerakeen, four enormous elephants that in turn stand on the back of A'Tuin the Great, the cosmic turtle, who swims forever through the vastness of space.<br /><br />Yes, these are things that Terry Pratchett has taken from all manner of ancient and modern writings, with a hefty dose of Dungeons & Dragons thrown in, but the genius of the conception is that he has taken everything that is patently untrue and used it to mirror the truth. It is this bizarre juxtaposition that provides the rich vein of thematic material and humour that Pratchett has been mining so successfully for more than 20 years and more than 25 novels.<br /><br />I have read about 10 of the Discworld series and in my opinion \\"The Colour Of Magic\\" is the best. Although the series is consistently entertaining and each book offers something new, yet they do get a bit samey after a while, like a pair of comfortable old slippers: you know what they will feel like when you put them on. But that is not true with the first of the series. It is new, it is fresh, the inspiration is red hot all the way through.<br /><br />All the characters are new: Rincewind, (Pratchett's favourite anti-hero), the failed wizard, who cheats death again and again, who plays the hero against his will, not by courage and skill but by great, bizarre, strokes of fate. Twoflower, the medieval insurance clerk who becomes the world's first tourist, who enjoys all the danger and adventure with the fearless, good-humoured aplomb of someone who is only watching. And, of course, The Luggage! Sapient Pearwood! Loyal, ferocious, fast, strong, bloody minded and indestructible, who will also keep your clothes freshly laundered and neatly pressed. Now there's some rich and unique characters!<br /><br />Terry Pratchett's inate philosophy of life comes through clearly in this volume, just as it does in all the other books in the series. All his characters are flawed, most of them deeply. Few of his heroes actually want to be heroes, those are do are invariably dumb as dishwater and are soon killed or made to look foolish. Rulers, whether of countries or organisations are generally paranoid, selfish and cruel. Happiness is only found by those without ambition who are blessed by fate. And, of course, books are special and must be preserved!<br /><br />Pratchett is one of the most successful writers in the last 50 years. Every bookshop in the world has a rack of his works, and they are greatly loved. If you read a few you will quickly see why. The combination of magical adventure, clever humour and humanist wisdom put together by a master craftsman is a winner.<br /><br />Yet every successful series has to start somewhere, and this is the first... and the best!ays the hero against his will, not by courage and skill but by great, bizarre, strokes of fate.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is the best show on television. Full of snarky dialogue and the kind of subplot that takes 2-3 viewings to get everything, it will constantly shock you with just how good it is. Veronica is instantly the kind of complex character that is simultaneously admirable and fallible- and all the while hilarious, with jaw-dropping dry comments so fast you'll find yourself hitting rewind just to make sure you understood it all. I have no idea how the writers accomplished the kind of character development that typically takes several seasons in one pilot. Pure genius. If you like stories filled with smart, strong female characters, you're gonna love it.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|I'm an unapologetic Metal Head (Have nearly every Iron Maiden CD! Love Dio, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Malmsteen, Helloween, etc.), and have to say that Tenacious D captures the heart of Heavy Metal in short, succinct masterpieces.  I know the CD is a \\"soundtrack\\" but the music could definitely be incorporated into a Rock Opera on the order of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  The movie wasn't great, but the music more than makes up for it, no matter how short some of the songs are. <br /> <br />Especially cool: <br />Kickapoo -- Killer song.  The riffs are driving, even the acoustical ones! <br />Classico -- Sweet little 1 minute song comprised of Bach and Mozart tunes.  It's good to see honors paid to the only form of music that's better and rocks the hardest: Baroque/Classical. <br />Beelzeboss -- Worth the price of the album, IMHO.  It has all the components for a mini-opera.   <br /> <br />I grant that there's a LOT of edgy and offensive language, but if you can handle the F bombs then the experience will pay off in spades. <br /> <br />Musically satisfying.  Get it!
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Jody and Mike are two brothers who find out that there's something strange with their local mortuary; the tall mortician lifts and puts a casket in a hearse by himself, hooded dwarves play hide and seek on the grounds, and a flying ball sucks the blood out of a poor man. With the help of their friend Reggie, they'll investigate the Tall Man's doings and what goes on behind close doors at the mortuary.<br /><br />A chilling cult classic from Don Coscarelli (Beastmaster, Bubba Ho-Tep), Phantasm has everything a horror fan wants. The film has just the right atmosphere, tone, and creep factor. They sure don't make them like this anymore! Coscarelli has created such a memorable film and an eerie antagonist you won't soon forget in the Tall Man, played to perfection by Angus Scrimm. Michael Baldwin, who plays Mike, does a great job with his character and must've had a ball riding that motocross and running around with a shotgun. There's something for everyone in this fast paced flick; sex in graveyards, a car chase featuring a 1971 black Plymouth Barracuda (I want that car!), dwarves running around in dark basements, ice cream trucks, severed fingers oozing yellow blood, an appropriately sinister score, and an awesome climax. The only let-down you might find is with the twist ending; the first time I saw Phantasm, I was actually disappointed with its ending. But as time goes by, you get to appreciate it and it does fit the film.<br /><br />The Anchor Bay DVD features the amazing original poster for its box cover; again, the kind of artwork for horror films that you don't see often these days. Included is a wonderful documentary that will take you back in time with the cast and crew, trailers and TV spots, home movies, interviews, and deleted scenes. Pick up a copy, boooyyyyy, you won't be disappointed!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I bought this for my wife for her birthday. It is 6 discs and is 22 hours + bonus material. My wife watched it all in 3 days.
B00004R99U|4.0|this film is great. Historically it is a little inaccurate. However it is a very well done disney film.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I am 57 yet I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and as a result bought the soundtrack.  It plays in my Subaru's CD and has songs that remind me of childhood, songs that are fun, and others that make me want to move to the beat.  It takes you through the movie and I find myself recalling little scenes from the movie.  It was an outstanding performance by Tom Hanks and he puts just the right amount of train conductor and wise sage in the cuts he does on this soundtrack.  I am glad I bought it.
159562015X|4.0|I've been using the StrengthsFinder assessment for some time with my career coaching clients.  We have not encountered any technical issues in taking the assessment (as some reviewers have noted).  While the book is not nearly as in depth as Buckingham's \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths,\\" I don't believe it was intended to be.  The real benefit is the updated and more useful reporting available with version 2.0. <br /> <br />Finally, I noticed that some reviewers did not believe their results were 100% accurate.  We need to remember that this assessment measures TALENTS which can become strengths, if they are not already developed.  Perhaps that's the case with some of those folks.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Casino Royale was one of the better James Bond novels. This movie is no where near as good a story.<br /><br />The acting is fine, but there is little cohesion in the movie. Even at this early date of seeing the DVD, I can't find any memorable scene to re-visit.
1582701709|4.0|I love the look and feel of the book.  The pages and images are very appealing.  I like that the author used other people's thoughts throughout the book.  Although the message gets a little repetitive, it was still a nice addition.  I would recommend this book to others. [[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]].
006112429X|5.0|This book gave a chilling portrayal of a mother's worst nightmare.  Shriver used events from real life, such as the tragedy at Columbine High School, to make the story feel like a biography, as opposed to a novel.  The book will leave you wondering if a child can be truly rotten to the core, despite loving parents that provide for every need and want.  This is an excellent book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|You don't need the HD DVD version unless you have the HD DVD player!  A Progressive Scan DVD player is different.  This version will play to your HDTV's specs. UNLESS you have the souped up newer technology, don't waste your money. <br /> <br />I was relieved to learn this version has a different narrator than S. Weaver.  The footage in this series is simply remarkable and from my very first viewing of it on the Discovery Channel I've been baffled as to why they chose her to narrate.  She is so dry and scripted.  I'm anxious to hear this original narration.  I'm pretty confident that it will undoubtedly be better. <br /> <br />Bottom line, I think this is a must have.  And don't be fooled by the other HD DVD and Blu-Ray versions unless you own that new technology.  And be happy that it's narrated by someone other that Sigourney Weaver.  That's my two cents worth!
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Well, after comparing the disks, to what I have in my vhs archives, here's what I've got.  First of all, I am pleased, in general with the release of the dvd.  That being said, I caught a few note-worthy glitches. <br /> <br />1. All concerts, excluding the \\"Winterland\\" performance, are overdubbed with \\"crowd response\\", assumingly, to give the viewing that massive crowd appeal.  I prefer the raw, untapped audio of the crowd, as it was.  To hear the \\"fake\\" crowd response, is like listening to a \\"live\\" cd (which is rarely \\"live\\"), or better yet...like watching a fight on ESPN Classic, listening to two commentators calling the fight \\"after the fact\\", as opposed to listening to the commentators calling the fight, as it happened! <br /> <br />2. The Summit '77 concert ends with a \\"spliced\\" version of \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\".  Two shows were performed,and video archived at the Summit, during the Love Gun tour.  Since the RARAN guitar solo is omitted from the original recording of the second night, the editors of the dvd (possibly Tommy Thayer), spliced in the guitar solo from the first night performance.  Obviously noticeable due to the difference in lighting; the first night performance was much darker in lighting than the second.  Even more noticeable, the splice in was way too soon, for it begins with Gene singing the second set of verses twice, before getting to Ace's solo. <br /> <br />3. The \\"bonus\\" disk I have is of the Madison Square Garden '77 performance.  It is a much reduced version of the bootleg; 27 minutes in all.  Due to the poor audio quality of the opening number (Detroit Rock City) from the original video recording, the audio was over-dubbed with the Budokan performance, up until around the end of the first set of verses. <br /> <br />4. The Gene /Paul audio is practically worthless.  I was expecting something more along the lines of insite on each performance i.e. \\"This is waht I was thinking before this performance\\", or \\"Ace was smashed during this performance\\", or \\"I wanted to kill Gene, when he forgot the words to this song!\\"  Check out Motley Crue's dvd music video collection; they critique every music video they ever made. <br /> <br />On the positive, the quality of the dvd's (audio / video) is waaaayyy better than the boots, which makes up for the \\"wining\\" points I make.  Also, there are nuggets of goodies throughout.  No need to mention them; they're listed above. <br /> <br />And one last thing; what's the difference between this KISSology dvd listing and the other one, \\"Kissology: The Ultimate Kiss Collection, Vol. 1: 1974-1977\\"?:-) <br /> <br />Can't wait for Volume II!
B000002AGE|4.0|\\"Birdland\\" [first track] is an unbelievable masterpiece.  Jaco Pastorius on the magnificent four string bass (before we knew what a 5 string bass would sound like he previewed the sound with a 4 string). And add Wayne Shorter on Sax and you have 4 or 5 really decent tracks for the 'jazz- heads' among you.  I was lucky enough to have witnessed this magic live in Austin Texas about 1977 at the old Paramount Theater.  It was the 'Heavy Weather Tour' and they opened with \\"Birdland\\". Other than a small tech. bug in the synth at the beginning of the show it was great.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The movie is impressive, and the disc is equally so, with fine picture, and very well done surround(I listened to the Dolby). The extras are not ample(compare to the mind-blowing pinnacle for extras:The Abyss-Special Edition!),but they are of impressive quality. 2/5 of the extras as well as the menu on the extras disc are in 16x9/widescreen, something of a rarity, in my experience! Having bought a budget widescreen HDTV last year, I find this detail significant and impressive. I don't know if this rates being a demo-disc, like 'The Fifth Element' was 8 years ago, but it might be, and so, I heartily recommend this set to every Bond fan and any action fan; you will NOT be disappointed! Because it truly is \\"Bond, James Bond\\", at its very best!
B00004U680|5.0|Just like \\"majicRay\\"'s review, Alice Cooper and Suzi Quatro was my first concert, 1975, Richfield Colieseum in Cleveland Ohio. Suzi rocked then, and listening to the first album again, she still rocks. Definitely the forerunner to the hard rocking women in music. Simple songs but very effective.
0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper highlights many different perspectives on an important ethical issue within the realm of modern day medicine. She gives her characters such a realistic voice by illustrating the complexities that lie behind many different types of relationships. Beautifully written, with a unique style, I could relate to every character in this book. Her constant connection to astronomy helped unravel an even deeper meaning of her work.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Do not buy/rent this movie unless you want to feel terrible about life. It has no moral value and is a POS in my opinion. 4 people all hooked on drugs with no real determanation to stop using but get more. It has a crappy ending that leaves you feeling terrible for those involved and put me in a bad mood  for wasting approximately 2 hrs. of my time when i could have watched somthing different. So unless you enjoy terrible movies that leave you feeling sad/depressed do not rent/buy.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby does an excellent job taking the regularly complex tasks of photography and cutting them down to super-simple bite-size pieces that anyone can digest and understand. <br /> <br />The book doesn't only cover techniques on \\"how to shoot like a pro\\" but also have invaluable sections such as \\"how to avoid problems like a pro\\" which cover everyday issues like avoiding red eye (w/ external flash), shooting in  the cold, etc. <br /> <br />Awesome book to pick up when you need quickly accessible nuggets of digital photography wisdom from a pro that doesn't feel like he needs to sound like one :)
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Gwen Stefani, love her or hate her, is all about money. On the front of 'The Sweet Escape' we are shown a dolled up Stefani which is exactly what we are presented with on this record. Don't get me wrong, I never thought Stefani was 'real' or anything but this record is just so plastic. Stefani tries to remake \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby\\" with the neptunes as head producers but ultimately fails.The songs are set to similar beats of \\"Baby\\" but none of the songs are as catchy.<br /><br /> The album opens with \\"Wind It Up\\", a very obvious attempt to remake \\"Hollerback Girl\\" with a few added yoddles. Unfortunately the yoddles make the song extremely annoying and Stefani's rap style verses are unintelligent (whats with everyone doing that now anyway?). Although the next two tracks make up partially for the bad start, the album doesn't run smoothly and becomes tedious. \\"The Great Escape\\" (song) is plaudable, even if very bubblegum and \\"Yummy\\" is clever enough. \\"The Wonderful Life\\" gives us the highlight of the album, with its clever dark lyrics and catchy chorus. These moments in the record are few and far between. We can see several attempts to remake \\"cool\\" from her last album, all ending up sounding cheesy (\\"Early Winter\\", \\"4 In The Morning\\"). And those songs are good in comparison to most of the Neptunes produced tracks. While \\"Orange County Girl\\" is appealing and catchy, some of the songs with the Neptunes are totally generic (\\"Breakin' Up, \\"U Started It\\"). Stefani's voice sounds unfocused and there is no clear goal seen through this album, except, well, her!<br /><br /> The occasional good points of the album show promise that Stefani can do work much better than this. This is further proved by the excellent \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby\\" before this record. Stefani needs to reform herself more for her next record, or else she'll just do another even worse duplication of this album. While \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby\\" felt epic, this album felt like it was strung together in a weekend. Be wary!<br /><br /> Download: \\"The Sweet Escape\\", \\"The Wonderful Life\\".Download: \\"The Sweet Escape\\", \\"The Wonderful Life\\".
B000N6TX1I|2.0|I am really, truly stunned by the critical response this movie has garnered. The praise for \\"Children of Men\\" just goes on and on... did we see the same movie? <br /> <br />I will say this in the movie's credit: the cinematography is, as has been said, spectacular. The action/suspense scenes will leave you clinging to your seat, feeling like you are really there. <br />The acting, likewise, is superb. Perfect actors, perfectly in character, throughout the whole movie. <br /> <br />But, people, that does not make a movie! It seemed to me like Cuaron got this cool idea in his head: \\"What would the world be like if there were no more children?\\" That, in itself, is a great premise to a movie. <br /> <br />The problem is, he took it nowhere. It was as if he couldn't decide whether he wanted to make a suspense/thriller, or a political/philosophical movie, and he succeeded at neither.  <br /> <br />Some movies can be vague about what's going on, or what's behind the scenes, and it makes the movie more interesting. \\"Children of Men\\" is not one of those movies. There are far too many unanswered questions, and rather than making the plot mysterious, it just left it empty. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I gave it two stars just because of the acting and visuals. For me, that's not enough to make a movie. I need plot.
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy is Pete Townsend's classic rock opera.  It tells the story of a boy born deaf, dumb, and blind, and his eventual coming out and triumph. The music is tremendous with great soaring pieces, well crafted lyrics, and an interesting story line.  Plus, it's the WHO; probably the best rock band ever. This is the album the include I'm Free, Pinball Wizard, Amazing Journey, and We're Not Gonna Take It. Actually, I really like the Overture. <br />This was one of the first albums I bought. It was my introduction to the WHO.  And, I play it quite frequently. <br />It is a classic album, and well worth the listen.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|The Limited Edition is worth the money for any FF fan. The extras you get are nice as well as you get a little more background info on the characters between the game and movie. In my opinion it was worth spending more for the LE set over the regular 2 disc set. I would recomend the LE set to any collector or FF fan.
0743496728|4.0|I picked up \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" solely on the review from Entertainment Weekly; they gave the book a grade of an A-, and their issue average for new books is a B-, so I figured this one had to be something special.  And I was not disappointed.   <br /> <br />\\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is an amazingly heartbreaking tale of some very lost individuals and how they each cope with their insecurities.  While the story flutters back and forth in time, it focuses on a small-town judge, Alex Cormier and her daughter Josie and their connection to a quiet, sensitive, young boy who walks into the high school one morning and kills ten people, injuring over a dozen others.  However, the actual event of the shooting is not the focus of this story: in fact, the account of the shooting is told in a very displaced, chaotic manner, making the reader feel as if he or she actually stood in the hallway and experienced it for his or herself. <br /> <br />What unfolds after those infamous \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is truly a story about growing up: not just for Peter, the shooter, who has to come to terms with what he did when thrown into jail and later on trial, but also and especially for Josie, who is almost Peter's counterpart.  She was his childhood friend who still talked to him behind her popular crowd's back, but she wasn't truly there for him when he needed her most.  While Peter never cared what people thought and therefore was bullied and harrassed for his independent and therefore deemed-odd behavior, Josie was overtly aware of others' eyes upon her, something inherited from her mother, the judge.  Josie is forced to come to terms with her actions (or inactions) and treatment of this boy everyone called an outcast.  As the defense attorneys like to claim, maybe the blame for the shootings does not rely solely on the one holding the gun.   <br /> <br />The story goes back and forth in time to really get into the psyches of the characters: to see what they have gone through and how far they've come...and how far they've fallen.  Peter may be the shooter, but he is not the villain.  Each and every character, including the seemingly untouchable Judge Cormier, is flawed, and because of that, the reader becomes acutely aware of the thin line between the characters.  Ms. Picoult takes a stance on the whole nature vs nurture controversy by saying that circumstance and environment play a strong role in molding a person.  Really, anyone can snap. <br /> <br />Ms. Picoult writes with an air of suspense: she doesn't reveal all of her cards right away, and little bits about Peter's actions and motive emerge as the page count grows.  At times this tactic becomes repetitive and leaves you wishing she would just spill the truth earlier, but when it finally does come, it is worth the wait.  Ms. Picoult explains what she needs to for any given moment and allows the rest to come naturally, as it would in the course of an investigation.  In a way, she allows the reader to become a character, too: maybe a jury member who is priviied to a LOT of background on the suspect and victims. <br /> <br />\\"Nineteen Minutes\\" should be optioned and made into a movie as soon as possible.  While the events of Columbine have faded in our society's collective consciousness, the fears and insecurities dealt with in Ms. Picoult's novel are still ever-present and are that which can be related to by generations across the board.
0880796863|3.0|ok so I was always interested into the occult. I always read about it, did some online versions of tarot, but I felt that I did not get the full experience. So after some research i got this pack for b/c i wanted the orginal version of the cards.  <br /> <br />the deck overall is  good, but the cards are WAY TO GLOSSY. I wanted that nice paper feel between my fingers, but all i feel is plastic. the pictures and quality are what i expected them to be, but just the way they feel was a real downer. its ok though, I am still having fun doing my own spreads and figuring out the meaning myself.
B000065BPB|5.0|The Sennheiser HD-280 have great sound, and they cup all the way around your ear, cutting out most ambient sound. They worked great on a plane or at home. The only down side is they make your ears a little warm, and they are a little heavy.
B00005NG9Z|4.0|This DVD was my first [[ASIN:B00005NG9Z Alice in Chains - Music Bank - The Videos]]real visual experience of band that I have been calling my favourite for 15 years. In a way it answered so many questions. What an experience? To watch the bands video clips back to back, told the story of the band and ultimately Layne's last years. I can't imagine getting the same perspective sitting there watching music video clips on TV over the years. Here you saw the talent grow continuosly,  coupled with the rise peak and fall of Layne and his relationship with drugs..... It was so compelling I showed my 13 year old - this is what drugs do to you. I loved the DVD, but then again I love Alice in Chains,  but shame about the Audio quality
B000BTC5LW|5.0|You know the music,now see the most awesome light show I have ever seen.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|After years in production, and the mounting anticipation from fans worldwide, Mike Patton re-emerges with \\"Peeping Tom\\" which as you may have heard by now is his take on what pop music should be like and what should be on the radio.  I have now had the album for about a month and now I feel it is time to way in on what this album is all about! <br /> <br />The first track listeners will hear is entitled \\"Five Seconds\\" which is an awesome way to open an album.  The vocals  that Patton does on this track are amazing and will make you wonder how he did it with the editing techniques.  \\"Mojo\\" follows, which is the first single.  Pretty rockin' song that gets you pumped. <br /> <br />Other stand-out tracks that I felt drawn to were \\"Don't Even Trip\\" \\"Getaway\\" \\"Your Neighborhood Spaceman\\" and \\"We're Not Alone\\".  The last song is just incredible with its mix of soft and hard beats and harmony!! <br /> <br />If you have liked any of Patton's earlier material, check this out.  It is different, but you will not be disappointed!
2253150711|5.0|A wild, wonderful book! Would recommend \\"The Stranger Next Door\\" by the same author as even wilder!
B0002SROT0|4.0|Elliott's final album (until New Moon that is...) manages to sum up all his amazing talent in 15 songs.  It definitely takes on a grittier side of Elliott with album opener \\"Coast to Coast\\", \\"Strung Out Again\\", and \\"King's Crossing\\" incorporating heavy distortion and the expected lyrical sadness as only the brilliant Smith could pen. But he also makes time for the beautiful acoustic moments.  \\"Let's Get Lost\\", \\"Twilight\\", \\"Last Hour\\" and \\"Memory Lane\\" are some of the standouts on this album.   <br /> <br />While I've noticed a lot of fans favoring his older stuff from Roman Candle and self-titled, \\"From a Basement on a Hill\\" is a fitting way for Elliott to be remembered. He was an incredibly brilliant musician with plenty of variety from rocking guitars to the acoustic softer side.  Anyone who is anyone should pick up this album along with every other album he's made. R.I.P Elliott, see you soon.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This is a great movie that keeps you guessing until the end!  I saw this movie on the big screen and had to buy it as soon as it came out!  This movie is worth the money and then some!  Enjoy!
1582701709|3.0|I belive in the main premis of the book in that positive thinking does help bring positive situations to you. I belive you also need to do something to get that positive action going, not just wishing it true which is what the book seems to say.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|I was very disappointed with this movie. The sound could have been a lot better.  The action was very pridictable and slow.  Give it a miss.
B000J10EQU|2.0|In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.<br /><br />Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:<br /><br />Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.<br /><br />Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.<br /><br />Once said \\"continent\\" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.<br /><br />Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?<br /><br />Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.<br /><br />The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.<br /><br />Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.  Superman has been co-opted to be a Christ-like father-son parable and on the way Bryan Singer forgot what made the first Superman movie so great: it was FUN!<br /><br />I could have made a better movie with my camera phone.ne!

B000002J0N|5.0|If your a CSN fan you will love this collection.  One of their best!
B0007LXPBI|5.0|The product was exactly what we ordered and arrived in a timely manner. It was even on sale! A first-class transaction from beginning to end.
B000002L9M|5.0|I just got the remastered disc with the dvd and extras. This will be a great purchase for the hardcore DM fan. Too many great reviews already on here to go into song by song specifics but I will add (my opinion anyway) that this album made DM. There is just something so beautiful, honest, bleak, emotional, naked, and truthful about this collection of songs. Sure they had made it big by this time with People are People and could have rested on their laurels and made Some Great Reward again and again (paging the Rolling Stones and bands like them...) but they really pushed themselves to new ground here. As Gareth Jones says on the DVD (he is great on the DVD) that this album was such a far cry from Just Can't Get Enough. I look at this album (and really all DM albums) as the alternative to so many things in society... guitar wanker bands, sappy love song bands (don't we have enough), hedonistic hippie love, boring overplayed top 40 music, etc. These guys have had one of the most inexplicable careers in music history. They sell out stadiums with next to no radio play in the US. Anyway thanks DM and thank you Martin Gore (the true anti-rock star) for the great, courageous music.
B000N3SS80|1.0|Wow.<br /><br />I didn't know music could get this bad. I just didn't.<br /><br />No words can describe how awful this CD is, but criticizing it is too easy.<br /><br />Let me list the reasons why you should not buy this travesty of an album (even the word \\"album\\" is used loosely - at best, this collection resembles a group of theme songs from various C-Grade Telenovela series):<br /><br />1. THE VOICE :<br /><br />There is no voice. Granted, JLO was never known for her vocal ability, but having taken vocal lessons and practice from husband Marc Antony, one would think she would sound better, but NO. If anything, Jennifers' weak voice is showcased as being even more weak as she literally whines her way through over an hour of the most godawful caterwauling ever heard this side of the Nanjing Massacre.<br /><br />2. THE MUSIC :<br /><br />There is no music. The first single \\"Que Hiciste\\" has some Spanish sounding instruments thrown in for that \\"authentic Mexican experience\\" (yeah, right), but from then on out, its one disgusting ballad after the other. There is no melody, and at one point, I was wishing that SOME poor B-side from her \\"On the 6\\" album would pop up to put me out of my misery. Let it be clear - the music on this is non-existent, and Im not just saying that for effect.<br /><br />3. THE ACCENT:<br /><br />JLO is not a genuine native Spanish speaker, but she has definitely worked on her accent. However, its a bit sad when Beyonce's new Spanish version of \\"Irreplaceable\\" sounds more authentic than anything on this godforsaken CD. Jennifer sounds very forced and gimmicky here, enunciating her Rs and Ts with gusto and a very misplaced conviction. The efforts only lead to what one can call an overwhelming sense of underwhelmingness (the term has come into existence upon the release of this CD)<br /><br />Jennifer, what went wrong? You had the best producers (though, when you think of it, Marc Antony's only claim to fame in the US is his horrendous \\"You Sang to Me\\") and enough moolah to pull this off. Inexcusable.<br /><br />More than that, it proves that the global Spanish revolution that sort of began in the late 90s with the Ricky Martin craze, is definitely over. Jennifer is done with, and when I start respecting her lesser, more vapid counterparts such as Thalia, its a sad day indeed.<br /><br />True Spanish language albums have CLASS stamped upon them - the only shining example of this is 'Fijacion Oral Vol 1' by our girl Shakira. This album still gives me goosebumps two years past its' release.<br /><br />'Coma Ama Una Mujer' is a failed effort for all concerned. And if you respect music and your money, you will definitely need to look elsewhere for fulfilment.<br /><br />Vaya con dios, JLOrrendous \\"You Sang to Me\\") and enough moolah to pull this off. Inexcusable. <br /> <br />More than that, it proves that the global Spanish revolution that sort of began in the late 90s with the Ricky Martin craze, is definitely over. Jennifer is done with, and when I start respecting her lesser, more vapid counterparts such as Thalia, its a sad day indeed. <br /> <br />True Spanish language albums have CLASS stamped upon them - the only shining example of this is 'Fijacion Oral Vol 1' by our girl Shakira. This album still gives me goosebumps two years past its' release. <br /> <br />'Coma Ama Una Mujer' is a failed effort for all concerned. And if you respect music and your money, you will definitely need to look elsewhere for fulfilment. <br /> <br />Vaya con dios, JLO
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This is the second album of theirs that I have purchased.  I must have an Irish background somewhere because I just love their music and after seeing them perform on PBS I had to have more.  You can even sing along as the lyrics are in the case.  Nice surprise.  I highly recommend this if you are into this type of music (my boyfriend hates it) !
B000J3EEBY|3.0|As an avid Loreena fan for years now, I am left feeling a bit underwhelmed by this album. Loreena has set such high standards for herself, so its a bit understandable that she would fall short, but the magnitude of this is amplified when you realize this is her first CD in years!<br /><br />Consider this Loreena's equivalent of Enya's comeback album \\"A Day Without Rain\\" (another mediocre effort from an otherwise superior world music artist).<br /><br />If you're familiar with Loreena's music, you should know one thing - tracks start off softly, with an overture that sets the tone of the whole tune before the actual intruments kick in (uillean pipe/sitar/tabla/drums), and then its pretty much verse-chorus-verse-chorus, unless shes singing a poem or sonnet, when she breaks with convention to go without any meter whatsoever. This works sometimes, but on \\"An Ancient Muse\\", the sum isn't quite what one would expect.<br /><br />Also, the album suffers from what I would call the \\"World Music\\" syndrome, where an artist so desperately wants to sound eclectic and world-wise, that they throw in instruments and sounds from every part of the globe. This may work for some people and artists (see end of review), and has even worked for Loreena (especially on \\"The Mask and Mirror\\"), but it does NOT work here. If you disagree with me, please play either her songs \\"Marco Polo\\" or \\"The Bonny Swans\\" and then listen to ANY track from this CD to see the noticeable difference.<br /><br />If you must complete your Loreena collection, then get this. However, if you're interested in true world music (now that Enya and Loreena are no longer trustworthy with this genre), check out the following CDs - they truly are masterpieces of their genre:<br /><br />1. Wes - \\"Welenga\\" (African Forest Hymns meets Electronica - AMAZING)<br /><br />2. Susheela Raman - \\"Salt Rain\\" (Traditional Religious scripts from India sung to modern jazz melodies)<br /><br />3. Kate Price - \\"The Isle of Dreaming\\" (I have always felt her to be better than Loreena, but strangely enough no one knows of her music. An unheard gem)always felt her to be better than Loreena, but strangely enough no one knows of her music. An unheard gem)
B0000A5A0T|5.0|i have actually met people who live without this album. whenever i think about that, i shake my head in wonder. i don't know how they do it.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|At first, I refused to listen to this cd. It was much different from Iowa and there self titled LP. They stopped swearing, but they are still heavy. It took me awhile to get use to this cd but it grows on you after awhile.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|Neal Morse constantly impresses me, the music is so sound, and tight.  The whole album is a fantastic mix of fusion, and metal.  I love anything that Neal does, and any project that Mike Portnoy is on.

1582701709|4.0|Although I am in the process of reading the book, so far I've found it to be  relaxed easy reading of general knowledge which we tend to either ignore, forget about, or simply dismiss.
0800141601|2.0|This movie is GOOD, if you do not think of the traditional Arthurian story.  But, unfortunately, to those of us who like the original Arthurian story, this is really a bad movie.  Also, Richard Gere's character fits his real life attitude and so he really didn't have to act in this movie....  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, as a movie, BUT, it has little to do with the King Arthur legend...  much like the more recent movie about King Arthur.  Because of this, it is a major let down to real Arthurian lovers......  So, I am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true Arthurian buffs down..... so, I will give it a 2 star rating....
B0002F6AH0|4.0|I first saw some of these programs as a child on TV.  It is a great review of the war through the lens of those who participated.  No modern look could ever be as compelling because of the volume of first hand information contained.  Good price too.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Ahh, Daniel Craig, lovely, lovely... <br /> <br />Casino Royale is a good, very good Bond movie.  Good plot, Good characters, Good action, a little long.  <br />I have enjoyed pretty much all the Bond movies, each having something in them to like, and its nice to get to know a character.  <br />It was hard, then to get past the anachronistic nature of Casino Royale.  We are told early that this is a young James, not yet a 00.  However, we all know James was young in the 50's, and while he has aged very well, its hard to get past the young Bond in the next millenium, with a boss who appeared fairly late in the series. I like Judi Dench, both as an actor, and in this part, but there is no mistaking her for the original 'M', she is the next 'M'.  So it is hard to put her with early 007.  It furrows one's brow, and so does irritate, just a little, while watching the movie.  <br />Now, make this James an illegitimate son(certainly possible!) of the James we know and love, and I think you have something.  I am sure this has been thought of before.  <br />The action and chase sequence had a Bourne series feel to it, as if trying to maximize what 2 characters can do and go through without actually being a video game, very riveting.  <br />Leading lady was very complementary.  The explanation of why she did what she did still left questions, and wasn't very satisfactory.  <br />We love the campy or serious extra characters on the side of good, we like them to be personalities, and colorful, and we got some of that in the CIA guy(don't know his name) and Mathies. <br />
1582701709|5.0|Loved it, everyone needs to read it and take it seriously.  It's a quick, easy read and very interesting.  It's written by and with very successful people and they certainly have something important to say.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This cd, along with the other ones he has put out has caugt me in a spell.  this cd goes along the lines of the Oregon trail and leaves you at the end of the Trail of Teas in music sences.  What I am trying to say is that dont pass this cd by, its like a fusion of rap and pop.  With most song radio frinedly i would describe this cd as a popy doo whop style that heards in your ears for a trippy ride.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|We bought it and watched it with our daughter last weekend and I found it to be AWFUL.... I grew up with the Mary Martin LP and was IN a performance of it when I was in about 3rd grade, so admittedly I know it better in the musical version and would not tolerate any deviation well, but YE gods. Cartoonish, offensive caricatures of Indians, pirates, busy dads, women and girls, a portrayal of Tinkerbell as homicidally jealous of Wendy, and not even the redeeming \\"Clap if you believe in fairies\\" line - that was completely left out. I do not remember this version from my childhood and ended up sorry that it was my daughter's introduction to the story.
0143034901|1.0|This is not a good book.<br />The story's premise is interesting enough with a young man intent on discovering the details of the life of a mysterious author.  His search eventually and improbably involves a throng of people far older than himself.  Only one character is very likable.  The rest, including the young man are bland or disagreeable.<br /><br />All of the characters in this book are extremely exaggerated.  The tormented are completely consumed by grief.  The loyal are unquestioning.  The feeble are totally helpless.  The world is dark.  Death is the only relief to suffering.<br /><br />This story is played out by one caricature after another.<br /><br />Bad guys have no redeeming qualities.  One bad guy \\"stares unblinkingly while licking his smiling upper lip.\\"  Apparently the author wishes us to envision a wolf.  However, this same character is most fond of spiders.  \\"They spin their webs and wait for their prey to become ensnared before pouncing\\".  How ridiculous.<br /><br />The main character eventually receives a letter from a woman he has met on two previous occasions.  The letter thoroughly explains all of the stories subplots.  Any loose ends are clean and scrubbed making the characters and their deeds fall nicely into place.  How clever.  Where did the author learn this technique?<br /><br />Zafon's writing is as flowery as the book's title portends.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Matt Damon basically played a character who had one facial expression the entire movie.  <br />It was a 3 hour movie that felt like a 4 hour movie, but shoud have been a 2 hour movie.

0744547814|5.0|This is a must have on your book shelf. We have had this book for at least a year and it's an old time favorite.
B000N3ST8Y|4.0|Here's DM's third album with the hits \\"Everything Counts\\" and \\"Love In Itself\\". This is also Alan Wilder's first album with the band writing two tracks: \\"Two Minute Warning\\" and \\"The Landscape Is Changing\\". This time the band would record sounds of the environment and incorporate it into their sound. Although there are nine tracks listed there's actually a tenth track-a short reprise of \\"Everything Counts\\". Artistically, this is an improvement over their last album with hardly a weak track. <br /> <br />On the DVD: <br />-A Short Film-Depeche Mode 1983:Teenagers growing up, bad government, and all that stuff. (38 min.) <br />-Album in 5.1 and stereo <br />-Additional tracks (stereo only): <br />Get The Balance Right <br />The Great Outdoors <br />Work Hard <br />Fools <br />Get The Balance Right (Combination Mix) <br />Everything Counts (In Larger Amounts) {an extended mix also on \\"People Are People\\" U.S. only album.} <br />Love, In Itself.4 {an acoustic track} <br /> <br />
0800177177|5.0|Ok you bunch of no taste bums! lol! First, the only word I could have ever associated with Dracula before I watched this movie was TACKY. The big capes, the really bad accents and the bats on a string, were all so overtly horrid, I could never bear to watch those movies. This movie was a dark love story with superb special effects and a truly superior performance by Gary Oldman as Dracula. I swear, I think that man can be anyone! I grant you, Keanu did have a poor grasp of the Brittish accent and Winona struggled a bit in the passion area, but their performances were above adequate and Winona was a perfect straight man to Oldman's lavish Dracula performance. Anyone who could insinuate that Anthony hopkins was even capable of a bad performance, should be strung up in the town square and tickled mercilessly until unconscious! lol!! <br /> <br />All the world is a critic and for my money, as long as I enjoyed a movie, the whys and wherefores aren't really that important. Maybe this kind of movie is not your cup of tea. If not, don't ruin it for the rest of us by your crude and mellow dramatic reviews. Take my advice, buy this movie! If you want to see the real love story behind the Dracula myth, without all the \\"bluck bluck, I come to bite your neck\\" stuff, then this movie is for you. If you want \\"Blade\\" in the 1800's, this is probably not for you.
B000002L68|5.0|I love Prince and the movie Purple Rain, so naturally I would get it.  The cd is worth every penny, I love every song on the ablum.  It's truly one of those albums where you can listen to the entire thing without having to skip over songs you don't like which is rare.  I recommend this cd to all Prince fans and Purple Rain lovers.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Like I did the first time I watched it.  I just happend to watch A Scanner Darkly for the first time before also watching this movie for the first time.  What better 2-movie combo to watch for the first time late at night while high as a kite?  I tell you none.  Eraserhead is the creepiest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen alot.  I'll let you watch it for yourself to agree, and spare you the details.
B000004286|4.0|I bought the cd for my boyfriend because he's a huge Braveheart fan. We listened to it together and it's very good! It's something I would listen to while doing homework because most of the songs are very peaceful while there are some that are more dramatic. It's not something I would drive around in the car listening to, but it's good just the same!
B000G0O5N2|3.0|I had high expectations for the Blue-ray version of this excellent movie, but I was disappointed as the picture quality was merely slightly better than the DVD version. In my first viewing I could not even tell the difference between this version and the regular DVD version that was released years ago. <br /> <br />I cannot comment on the audio side as I am yet to test it on a 5.1 audio setup. I'd only recommend buying this disc only if you don't own the DVD version already. <br /> <br />My HD set is 1080i if you are wondering. <br />
B000MNP2K8|5.0|This was by far the best James Bond in years. Plenty of action,not a great deal of sex that would embarrass me in front of my kids. There were not as many gadgets which I missed. Overall a great movie that I will watch over and over.
0066620996|5.0|Best business book I've ever read...with tremendous relevance to your personal life as well. A must read!
0140120416|5.0|Alright, i'll break it down for you. This book gives you EVERYTHING you need to learn how to speak russian fluently. The book itself is broken down into lessons and throughout the lessons its broken down further into Exercises. Then, at the end of the lesson they have anywhere from four to six exercises. Make sure your actually DOING THEM! they will help you immensely. At the end of the book they have a Russian to English and then after that an English to Russian vocabulary section that covers most of the common words in russian (the vocab. takes up the last 200 pages). DONT BE INTIMITADED, stay open minded, ask questions (if you have the resourses), have fun and enjoy it. Russian is an awesome language!
0783227434|1.0|The only thing reedeemable about this movie is the beautiful Embeth Davidtz, without her, the movie is pathetic. Honestly, this movie is one of the worst I ever witnessed. \\"The Mummy\\" doesn't even equal its patheticness, and that is saying something!!

075662472X|5.0|My son is a huge Spiderman and Super Friends fan. He asks questions constantly about certain characters, their powers, are they good guys or bad guys, etc. For Christmas, my Wife gave me the DC Comics version so he and I could look up all the characters and know the who's and what's of each. Great time spent with something we both enjoy. I bought the Marvel version as a companion resource as he really is in to Spiderman more. <br />One Note - the Marvel world is  abit darker as far as the look of characters, and how they got their powers, etc. Some of these did scare him a bit, but after we talked about how this is all made up, someone's imagination he was OK. Just know if you child scares easily, you may want to see a copy first before showing it to him/her.
0451457994|1.0|I know a lot of people love this book, but I thought it was not that great.  I give it one star because the first 20 pages or so were really good.
B000MV9026|5.0|This is such an adorable, cute and fun movie!!  It has already become a family favorite!
B0000VD04M|4.0|A movie about a cross dressing director?  Sounds crazy, but \\"Ed Wood\\" is a wacky, sweet, and endearing movie propelled by the incomparable genius of Johnny Depp. The subject of this movie, supposedly the worst American movie director of all time, is a truly complex character, a man torn by his love of angora and of telling a story on film.  It would be easy to make Ed Wood into some kind of lunatic, but through the master touch of Mr. Depp and the skillful direction of Tim Burton, the viewer comes to understand and even empathize with Ed.  This movie also has an excellent supporting cast including Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and a brilliant portrayal of Bela Lugosi  by Martin Landau.  The friendship between Bela and Ed is a sweet, endearing thread that is woven throughout the movie.  I had heard about this movie long ago, but watched it only a couple of years ago.  I am so glad I did, and so glad I purchased the DVD.  If you want to watch an artistic, entertaining, and true story about a truly unique character, purchase this film.  It will easily become one of your favorites!
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is a movie that every golfer should see! Well done with great special effects for enhancing the golf matches. Authentic and true to the book and history. Captures the real mental and physical strategy of competitive golf.

1582701709|5.0|The Secret is an excellent book, simple, straight forward and easy to understand.  Filled with profound thoughts about life that you suspected were true all along.  Well worth reading, not a new subject, but certainly one of the easiest and quickest to read on the subject of creating our own reality.  This book gets and A+ for being uplifting!
B00003CWLF|1.0|This film was a real let down. Jodie Foster was wasted in a familiar tale that wasn't told the way we remember it.  Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner keep their titles of Anna and the King.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Great movie. A classic Disney movie that is finally available in platinum edition.

B000KJU1HI|4.0|Great inside look at some legends from our youth.  Those were great times in which to live.  There was so much hope that we could make a difference and Dylan became the poet/catalyst for a generation of individuals who became a movement for social justice.  We could use some of that power today. <br />             peace and love, <br />                               Harve / Miami, FL

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig is easily the best Bond of all time.  He delivers his lines with great precision, and while Pierce Brosnan said his lines in pure cheesiness, Craig nails it.  You believe every line he is about to say.  He is funny and scary at the same time, and let's face it: that torture scene...can you imagine any other James Bond trying to pull it off?  I haven't been much of a James Bond fan due to how corny it has always been, but if Daniel Craig is Bond, I am a convert.  This could be the start of a great series!
0931838401|5.0|No, that's not a typo - no matter how astute a camera collector or photographer you may be, until you look through this book you just don't know what you don't know!<br /><br />I found the organization of the book a bit obscure at first (it is alphabetical by manufacturer and then within that roughly alphabetical by model, which can be tricky if you don't know the manufacturer).<br /><br />Soon enough I was able to find most any camera I set out to identify and discovered in the process a number of other interesting cameras that I didn't know existed, and tons of trivia about cameras that I do know.<br /><br />While it is difficult to produce a truly comprehensive guide about something as exhaustive as camera gear, this book does fairly well though it is at times really heavy on some areas (like Leica for example...) and conspicuously light in others (like Asahi Pentax...).<br /><br />Notwithstanding all that, it is a terrific book to curl up next to the fire with and while away a few hours.  That is of course if you have strong arms or a book stand!

B000JIHP88|5.0|I love this mobile so much that I ended up buying one for my 3 month old niece.  They love it too!!  This is one of the best mobiles because of the movements and the colors as well as the fact that you still have a little night light with a music box when you detatch the mobile part.  Not to mention that it plays music for close to 20 minutes.  My 13 month old loves it (and so does my 4 year old).  He is just mesmerized by it when he's tired and amused with it when he wakes up and turns it on after he's done sleeping.   <br /> <br />I was a little reluctant about this mobile when I read some reviews about it being too quiet.  I wanted to set the record straight.  The mobile is quiet...but it's for a baby and you are trying to lull them to sleep so how loud do you want it to be?  I think that the volume is perfect but if you prefer to make it louder or the house is loud you can switch it to a louder volume but we always keep it on the softest and it's just fine. <br />I highly recommend this mobile.
B00063F8B2|5.0|We give it a strong 5 stars.  Young and old alike will love this movie.  Nothing in it is offensive, and it has a great message of hope.

B000002KIK|1.0|\\"Never Say Die\\" is the very worst Sabbath album.  Black Sabbath is the very best heavy metal band, and also the fist, but this was their worst hour. <br /> <br />Checkout \\"Master of Reality\\" or \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"Volume 4\\" or \\"Black Sabbath\\" (self-titled) or \\"Sabbatage\\" or \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\".  Those are the very best heavy metal albums of all time.   <br /> <br />After \\"Never Say Die\\", the next worst Sabbath album is \\"Tehnical Ecstacy\\", but its really a cut above this fart.   <br /> <br />Albums from the non-Ozzy eras (Dio, Gillan, Hughes, Martin) have very solid and innovative guitar playing and the absolute \\"most\\" signature riffs from the original inventor of the heavy metal guitar riff, Tony Iommi.  Tony Iommi really makes quality music, apart from \\"Never Say Die\\" and \\"Technical Ecstacy\\".   <br /> <br />I've listened to every Sabbath album from 1970 to 1999.  On \\"Never Say Die\\", the guitar player, Tony Iommi seems to have stopped practicing altogether.   <br /> <br />The guitar playing on ANY other album by Sabbath is really good.  Really, you can't go wrong with any Sabbath album from any era, except for this one.  Apparently, Tony thought they could make it as a pop/glam band with no guitar riffing.   <br /> <br />A good lesson for all of us, Do What You Do Best, and only then expand from there!  I am glad Ozzy left the band!  The albums from the next two vocalists (Dio, and Gillan) were some of the the heaviest innovative albums for the genre!   <br /> <br />Look at it like this:   <br />1978 - Black Sabbath is making glam-rock that isn't even catchy. <br />1979 - Ozzy quits <br />1983 - Black Sabbath is making music so heavy that Death Metal bands are still covering it twenty years later. <br /> <br />See what I mean?
0684874350|4.0|I thought this was an amazing memoir that really shows the reader that there are so many things in our present day lives that we take for granted, while there are so many people all around us that barely have enough to survive. Frank McCourt tells the reader about his own very scarce childhood in Ireland. He retells how he lived as a little child and eventually grew up into a man by making sure that his family was provided for as best he could provide as a teenager. As he grows into a man he begins to realize how important his contributions are to his starving family.  <br /> <br />In this very personal recollection Frank McCourt shows the reader true pain and suffering. He really brings you into the situation and makes you feel the cold and the damp. Although this is such a heart-wrenching story this is by far one of the best books I have read recently.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This has been one of our best purchases in a long time, with value for money. The anniversary edition far surpasses the normal dvd, which we had before. In addition to having the movie (a classic) - the special features are amazing, educational, insighful, entertaining. To see and hear the original cast members chat about their experiences and memories during the filming of the original movie is fantastic. You get to see the real Maria on whose life the story was based, and discover that she had a small appearance in the actual movie. There is so much to learn regarding the background of this movie. Our 8yr old thoroughly enjoyed it as did my 5yr old, and it was nice to have something suitable to look at with our children. Very pleased with this purchase!
B000MXPE7O|5.0|Incredibly low key and tense story of the CIA. Great perforances, if somewhat understated. Cinematography is superb. Jolie is the weakest link here.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I bought this cd with accompanying dvd (the making of Awake) for my 8yr and 5yr old daughters who have started a collection of Josh Groban cds and dvds. They really enjoy classical and opera, and have locked on to his music. My husband and I have grown to like Josh's music through our daughters. Although we had already bought the cd, we decided to buy this product with the accompanying dvd on the making of the album. It was well worthwhile. The folder contains the cd, song booklet, and dvd which is very enlightening and allowed us to see a side of Josh Groban that we have not yet seen before. One of the things I find disappointing in all the cds we have bought so far is that there are no accompanying english translations in the song booklets - this one does not have it either. While we have learnt a lot of Italian, Spanish and French songs from Josh's cds, it would be nice to know what we are singing - so if an english translation were side by side with the foreign one, it would be nice. <br />My daughters enjoyed seeing the backgroud story on the dvd and were quite touched to see him both working and playing - especially coloring with a little girl and his sense of humor. The main thing we like about it is that it is clean entertainment that our whole family can enjoy together. I was a little taken aback at one point to see that he uttered what seemed to be an expletive but it was \\"beeped\\" out, thankfully, and my daughters were none the wiser. I hope that he doesn't allow that to happen on any of his future projects. The songs are wonderful, his singing range really comes out on this album, and the variety of music is refreshing. A daring but successful dive into other rhythms - African. It is a nice addition to our collection!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is the best Bond movie ever, and I started watching them when Dr. No was released in the early 60's. Not everyone will agree, but this Bond can move and looks the part more than the dreamy actors who played him before. The action is first rate, and almost believable for a change. The naked torture scene hurt even watching, but this Bond apparently has gonads of steel. And not since Bond got married has there been any better emotion peeking through Bond's surface toughness. Great cinematography as well.
B000002UB3|5.0|I've said it before- the Beatles (well, Lennon and McCartney, at any rate) are the equivalent of J. S. Bach. The melodies are lovely, the harmonies complex, the variations wonderful. Their commercial success is well deserved. They are head and shoulders above any contemporary classical composer.<br /><br />I am a professional traditional musician and a published and recorded song-writer. If you don't like the Beatles nothing I can say will change your mind. And if you do like them this review is pointless.<br /><br />But I wanted to say it anyway.
B000M341QE|4.0|Damon, Wahlberg, and DiCaprio complement Jack Nicholson nicely in this mob drama. The violence isn't overdone, but the plot is. How can so many cell calls be made unnoticed? Well OK, it's fiction and well done. But best movie???...I think Brokeback should have won! Oh yeah, that was last year. It is still better movie than this one.
B000BYCAJE|4.0|Hear some hidden tracks in this remaster and hear 4 new-old pearls. If you like to collect CSNY oldies do not lose this one.
B00005JPMX|4.0|This is the turtles for the new generation.  They have taken away most of the wry humor of the comics and the 3 live action movies and made things a bit darker.  They also don't call them teenagers or mutants either.  They are simple ninja turles.  The story is fairly simple with the tutles being in disarray and longtime villain Shredder dead.  The new bad guy is an immortal trying to gather together 13 monsters.  The animation is very good and if you like karate action, then this is for you.  Some of the storyline is a tiny bit intense for the really young ones, but there is no blood, swearing, and a kiss at the end is the only thing sexual.  It is worth a watch.
B000002MK8|4.0|I've never been a Rod Stewart fan, having hated his mid-period 'If you think I'm sexy' stuff and then just gave up on him until I heard this. A superb unplugged session from the early 1990's.<br /><br />Starting with a fiery version of 'Hot Legs', you know immediately this is Rod Stewart going back to his early 70's rock 'n' roll best. Track three is 'Handbags and Gladrags', now very familiar in the UK as the theme to 'The Office' that it came as quite a shock to here somebody sing it. I haven't heard the original version but this must push it close.<br /><br />Its not a perfect album though. Rod should have left Tom Waits 'Tom Traubert's blues (walting matilda)' well alone. Once you've heard Tom Waits original version nothing else is worth listening to. If you don't know Tom Waits, he has a voice that makes Rod Stewarts sound like an operatic soprano!<br /><br />Fortunately Rod saves the best until last and 'Mandolin Wind', 'Highgate Shuffle' and 'Stay with Me' are all rock 'n' roll Rod from the early 70's - absolutely superb. Sadly the DVD of this isn't available, but it was filmed, and hopefully it will be released one day.
B000002GB9|3.0|I'm old enough to remember when this album was first released in the 70's - It wasn't as good as I remember it back then, but is still a good example of the classic (?) Styx sound (high vocals and keyboards, and progressive rock drumming), and has some of Styx's most memorable songs (Grand Illusion and Fooling Yourself).  I'm not a big Styx fan and purchasing this CD kind of reminded me why - it's OK to listen to, but at the end of the day, the songs sound too much alike and I can only take it in short bursts.  It's a good addition (a must?) to a 70's rock collection, but beyond that, it won't leave you wishing you had more songs to listen to.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Even though it is already out on DVD, I'm glad I saw it on a proper cinema screen. No doubt I'll get the DVD, but it's one of those flicks you'd want to see at 'the movies' at least once.<br /><br />Warning: SPOILERS FOLLOW, but nothing that gives the plot away too much.<br /><br />It's difficult to add to the good things said about this movie, but I'll try, leaving the most important bits till last.<br /><br />About the cinematography. Beautifully done, but not cloyingly so, or in a way that makes it get in the way of the story. After the intro, which is rather long and arty--this isn't a criticism, just an observation--the images become unobtrusive. The way it was done was reminiscent of the way Ridley Scott used images in The Duellists; effectively and many had the quality of paintings, but they always enhanced and never distracted or occasioned that annoying \\"what great cinematography\\" effect, which usually takes you out of the story for sometimes distractingly long periods.<br /><br />The story. It matters, but the whole effect of the 'surprise' has been overemphasized in most reviews that talk about it. It's not about sudden revelation, but about completion of a carefully spun web is deception. Personally, I wasn't surprised, and I wasn't looking to be surprised. I just loved the way things came together in complete closure--not just Eisenheim's deception, but also the strands of inevitable cosmic justice and a sense of final equipoise and closure. Anybody watching with any amount of sensitivity should see it all coming, and those who don't see it will still sense it. It's all very subtly done; and as such it creeps up on you, and you don't even know consciously that it's there. So, it's not the 'surprise', such as there is, that matters, but the wholeness of it all and the watching of it unfold.<br /><br />The whole 'mystery' thing and its 'supernatural aspects was also been overemphasized in many reviews. There is, to my mind, no suggestion that an interpretation allowing for a life-after-death explication of the whole story was intended. If anybody thinks there is, they should consider themselves a part of those members of Eisenheim's audiences who thought that his tricks were evidence for the survival of the spirit. This is evidenced clearly by a single and unambiguous statement of Eisenheim to Sophie, which was as much a declaration of his love for her as it was a denial of the validity of the 'supernaturalist' or 'spiritualist' interpretation of his tricks and the denouement of the story. Reason why people miss it, is that the context of the statement distracts from its significance with regards to other areas. It's one of the ways in which this movie is very subtle and devious about revealing itself. A truly masterful script.<br /><br />There's a social theme interleaved into all of this, usually described as being a 'class' issue. I would not put it that crassly. It does however have to do with democracy, in the sense of the notion that in some way everybody has a right to be heard, no matter their social standing may be. This again is brought out clearly in the Crown Prince's final soliloquy, when faced with Inspector Uhl's revelations and his imminent fall from grace. Here, too, though, subtlety and focus on character took the place of pat social proselytizing.<br /><br />Romance is the driving force of the movie. Nothing at all would have 'happened', and Eisenheim would never have returned to Vienna, had it not been for Sophie.<br /><br />Eisenheim: I was meant to return. I just... I kept thinking I'll find around the next corner.<br />Sophie: What?<br />Eisenheim: A real mystery. I saw remarkable things but the only mystery I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you.<br /><br />Nothing more need to be said about that. The other stuff was just backdrop and devices. The fuel for the fire was love; not some social or spiritual agenda nonsense.<br /><br />In line with the rest of the movie, the one and only love/sex scene between Eisenheim and Sophie was both subtle and yet intense, both in terms of interaction as cinematography; making everything that happened there unabashedly romantic and therefore intensely erotic without requiring over-explicitness. There is an inherent difficulty in movies--and novels--where two characters come together in a love scene, as we know they must in order for things to proceed. (Unless the event is placed at the end as the denouement, but his was not the case here). The characters have to at least confess their love; probably do more and kiss; maybe go beyond that and 'consummate'. The danger of making this whole process almost perfunctory--as in it being necessary, and so it just has to be there; which takes a lot of the zing out of it--is great. And there's always the danger of there either being too little, which leaves the viewer unsatisfied, or too much--especially of explicit sex--which in this context would have been out of character for the tone of the film. There's also the danger of a love-scene just being a sex-scene; a common failing nowadays, in film and novel alike.<br /><br />The Illusionist gave us exactly what was needed. A lead-up which made us expect something of what was about to happen, but nobody quite knew what shape it would take; a coming together after the briefest of recrimination for a past disappointment; a panning away from the act itself with some fairly non-explicit and very creative pans across part of nude human anatomy; and, most importantly, an after-the-fact lingering, not just on the romance, but on how it connected to everything else, past, present and future, disappointments and hopes.  And never in all that was there a moment's doubt that this, and nothing else, was what the movie was all about. Which means we end up actually believing--even if a twitch of \\"oh, here it comes\\" is there at the start, with maybe a \\"are they going to screw this up?\\"--what these people are doing, and despite the apprehension lurking in some of us, like me, about being taken out of the story because this is another sex-scene, we come out of it realizing that it is in truth a love-scene and one that seamlessly connects to everything else in the story.<br /><br />Lastly, cynics be warned: The Illusionist is at its core a cunningly-disguised feel-good-movie. It doesn't have a cynical bone in its body, even though it doesn't see the world through rose-colored glasses either. But one doesn't have to, and one can still not be a cynic.<br /><br />There will, of course, be cynics who love this movie, though they'll probably strenuously deny that they were captured by its charm, rather than its intellectual messages, arty cinematography, crafty plot--or whatever cynics think they need to put up as good explanations for liking this flick. Sentimentality is unfashionable among the 'educated' and enlightened who know what's real and what isn't. The Illusionist is an excellent antidote to the poison of deluded intellectualism--ironically working its effect by a pretension of appeal to the intellect.in terms of interaction as cinematography; making everything that happened there unabashedly romantic and therefore intensely erotic without requiring over-explicitness.

0375831002|5.0|This is a special book--one that I will recommend to others for a long time.  The poetic writing creates vivid pictures of a war-torn Germany.  We learn to care so much for Liesel Meminger, her Mama and Papa, her best friend Rudy, and even the crotchety neighbor who lives next door.  I was so sad to see it end, as I will miss these people and their world.  This would be a great book club book as there is much to discuss.  Don't miss it.
0805066691|5.0|This book is highly readable even though its actually &#34;stitched up&#34; from original official source documents.  I got the sense of who were the true environmentalists in contrast with the &#34;savages&#34;.<br /><br />For those who'd rather see a movie, watch &#34;Geronimo: An American Legend&#34; an untypical complicated western that skillfully manages the interplay of battlefield action, suspicions, misunderstandings and genuine dignity. The movie gets close to paying tribute to one of the chapters in this book.<br /><br />A precedent for the Kyoto protocol is clearly illustrated in the way some American tribes consider the impact (for several generations) on the use of their natural resources. Environmental accountability and stewardship at its best.<br />The carbon offsets derivatives market is an attempt to monetise environmental impact accountability. It's scandalous to think of who benefits financially as the derivatives broker making a commission on each transaction. But it maybe the best way to put a monetary amount for the value and make the incentive for environmental conservation more clear and actionable on a quarterly basis.<br /><br />I saw a recent History Channel documentary about Custer's Last Stand and I couldn't help but feel that the continual dramatisation of Custer's story was ridiculous...when contrasted with the struggles and betrayals experienced by Native Americans.
B00003CXC6|4.0|Sometime during the 12th century in Japan, three men, a woodcutter, a commoner and a priest, find themselves under the ruin of the Rashomon as they seek shelter from the heavy rain. As they wait for a break in the weather, they discuss the trial of the bandit Tajomaru, accused of killing the samurai Takehiro after having raped his wife. But was it what truely happened? The more we listen to the witnesses, the further we seem to drift away from the truth....    As I read reviews here and there, I quickly realized that there were basically two sides: the enthusiasts (the majority), some of which almost implying that there just can't be anything to complain about since this movie is widely considered as one of the most important in cinema history. And then there are those who are quick to argue that this movie is overrated, even boring. So, are the former just name-droppers in select parties, hoping to pass for the artsy-witsy type? Or are the latter either ignorant or trying to be hipper than hip by going against the greater number's judgement?    I think the main issue here is that those two sides just aren't talking about the same aspects of the movie. If there's one thing that's undeniable about Rashomon, the movie that truely revealed its director to the world, earning him a Golden Lion in 1951 at the Venice Film Festial and a honorary award at the Oscars, is that at the time of its release, this movie broke grounds both technically and in terms of story-telling. Maybe the most famous of those technical \\"innovations\\" is the pointing of the camera directly at the sun: to us now, it may comes as completely anticlimatic, but this was breaking one of the biggest taboos at the time    But maybe the one aspect of this movie that immediatly impressed the most was the storytelling, this presentation of several perceptions on what happened that fateful day, leading us only to accept in the end that the factual truth, because we couldn't experience the events first hand butonly through the eyes of the various witnesses who all played a part in them, is forever lost to us. Such use of subjectivity to present a singular fact to the audience, therefore shaking their confidence in what they have actually seen, continues to this day to influence movies. Surely, if Rashomon hadn't been made, another director would have done just the same, but the first happens to be Kurosawa, and whatever one's appreciation of this movie is, the fact remains that, for those reasons alone, it deserves our utmost respect    But does it deserve our love? Now that's the hard one. It is certainly not an emotionally engaging movie: you're never really brought to care for the characters, which is probably the one reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars, no matter how much of a piece of history that movie is: I just need to emotionally connect with a movie at some level to be fully engrossed in it, and Rashomon just doesn't do that for me. However, it definitely is an intellectually engaging movie, and relatively short. The multiple layers in the visual, the acting, the philosophical statements all almost make up completely for it, and it ends before the lack of emotional ties leads you to lose interest in the story    Also, if you are after a Kurosawa movie which will entertain you from the word go, you would be far better off watching \\"Seven Samurai\\" or even \\"The Hidden Fortress\\". Rashomon lacks this fun factor - on the surface: dwelve on it some and the irony of the woodcutter's second tale, between Tajomaru's child-like glances and the swordfight's parody, which come in direct contrast with the others' tales, and in particular Tajomaru's own, can definitely qualify as funny, although it is much more likely to bring a soft chuckle rather than an outright loud laugh out of you    You may be put off by other details: the lack of dialogues for one. I would however argue that more dialogues wouldn't have been necessary, nor would they have shed anymore light on the case. What the director wants us to know without being put into words transpires through clever camera work, precise use of space and of the elements the environment provides (weather conditions, light, shadows of the foliage, etc). What may also grate on your nerves is what may pass as overacting (in particular in Mifune's and Machiko Kyo's cases): that being said, for one, acting standards in Japan are slightly different from those in the West. What I mean by that is that what they consider good acting may often be considered as unnatural and overacting by us. There's also another explanation: we aren't witnessing the facts as they actually happened. In a sense, the characters involved in this deadly affair are all, as they testify, performing, hoping to convincingly present the events in a way that will best serve their interests and, in the words of the others, they are but mere puppets who are made acting to suit their needs. No wonder therefore that a sense of surreality permeates these performances    Another point that may be annoying is the lack of resolution: sure, the image the woodcutter walking away with the baby under sun that is at last shining forth provides for a hopeful note. But the movie, through the camera angle during the testimony scenes at the court, puts you in the position of the judge, of the person who is there to seek out the truth. Yet you are forced to admit in the end that you'll never find it     But then the next question should be: do we need to know? Tajomaru, whatever the role he played, has, from what we are told, killed other women already: even if his role in this affair remains unclear, his fate, now that he is in the hands of justice, shouldn't. The samurai's wife, whether she has encouraged this violent act or not, will live a life of shame, a fate maybe worse than death. The samurai will cannot be brought back to life anyway. As for the woodcutter, even if he has taken the dagger to resale it, his generosity towards the child certainly more than redeems the theft    Interestingly enough, Kurosawa, it seems, never thought of Rashomon as of one of his best movies. And as for myself, I tend to agree with that statement, if only because it isn't too engaging on an emotional level. Still, Rashomon remains a movie that should be watched by any aspiring film-maker as well as any person more or less interested in the art of film-making in general. But I would also definitely recommend it to anyone not afraid of rather depressing yet tinted with hope, philosophical statements, and willing to spend the necessary time to reflect on it afterwards and possibly treat themselves to more than one viewing    A last word on the DVD itself: I've only watched the Criterion Collection edition of this movie, and I don't think I'll ever need another one. The restored transfer's quality is absolutely superb, even though I am tempted to say that the image faired better than the sound. The translation, from what little I can judge, is adequate; I have, however, only listened to the English dubbing for a hanful of scenes, so I can't say much, apart that it seemed terribly out of sync sometimes. The extras are all insightful, be it Robert Altman's introduction, the documentary extract on Kazuo Miyagawa, the cinematographer, or the audio commentary by Donald Richie. Also, the booklet that accompanies the single disc contains the two short stories on which the script was based, which is a most welcome addition

1582701709|5.0|This is a great book.  The message of the power of positive thinking is one that everyone most likely is aware of, but it helps to have it reinforced throughout the book by highly regarded authors and speakers.  There are also numerous examples throughout the book of how positive thinking has specifically worked in people's lives.  The one thing that I found disturbing about the book was it's highly secular slant - the idea that we are in some way \\"our own god\\" or can reach the level of the highest power of the universe (i.e., God).  But I think the author deliberately left out the mention of God in the book so that it would appeal to the masses -from atheists to strong believers, and everyone in between.  If you have a strong religious persuasion, you may find the idea that \\"you create your own universe\\" disturbing.  But, overall, I really loved the book, and it has a message that everyone can benefit from hearing and living.  If we all lived according to the law of attraction and the power of positive thinking, and our actions were truly governed by love (which I was glad to see the book stressed the importance of), our world would be a much happier and harmonious place.  I highly recommend this book.

But the 47 minute-long runtime definitely leaves you hungry and feeling that they could have done more before releasing a new album.<br /><br />I concur with some of the other reviewers that the special edition is not really worth the money: you will probably be equally satisfied with the regular edition. As for tracks worth noting, obviously \\"Intervention\\" and the new version of \\"No Cars Go\\", but also the intimate \\"Ocean Of Noise\\" and \\"Windowstill\\", one of the most [[ASIN:B0002IVN9W Funeral]]-like tracks on the album along with \\"Intervention\\".<br /><br />All in all, I give it 4.5 stars, mostly for leaving me wanting so much more.

It draws the reader into the narrative and keeps the tension growing toward the inevitable ending. It is an eyeopening counterpoint to the America-centric view of the world today. The novel should allow the reader to explore his/her preconceived notions and develop a broader understanding of other peoples and cultures.

With classics like Lucky Star (still one of my favorites), Burning Up, Holiday, Everybody, and Borderline, this album was just the beginning of things to come from this trailblazer, daredevil, and fashion icon. This is not a perfect album but it's worth buying.  Madonna is one of my favorite female performers, I recommend everyone of her albums and concert dvd's. She's been ruling the world for the past three decades and may she continue to do so for as long as she lives. God Bless you Madge!

B000M341QE|5.0|After watching this movie you are in doubt as to who is the protagonist of the movie. Is it DiCcaprio, is it Matt Damon or Jack Nicolson? You wonder. Such is the finesse of the director. Martin makes even other co-stars Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and others such as Jack Nicolson's men and Vera Farmiga as the Psychiatrist stand out with their performances making you feel that almost everyone in the movie is important. The acting is brilliant and almost everyone delivers.  <br /> <br />And if you thought all the villians were played, Jack Nicolson just proves you wrong. It is amazing to see that he can still go on delivering memorable performances for his age.  <br /> <br />One of the finest scenes of the movie is the conversation scene between DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson after the latter suspects a rat in his band of men. This is a scene that will send your heart pounding even if it was just a simple scene of two people talking. Full stars to DeCaprio and Jack. There are several other notable and dramatic scenes exuding brilliant performances from the stars bringing the climax to a heart pounding finish. <br /> <br />It is also difficult to believe that this is a retold story of another movie. Similar movies have appeared in the past notably Donnie Brasco and LA Confidential but Martin's treatment of The Departed proves there's more to such stories.  <br /> <br />Action is gory and language will not be appropriate for watching with children.  <br /> <br />On Oscar night, if George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Capolla had to be on the stage to present Martin with the Oscar for best Director, it was not without reason.  <br /> <br />Five stars.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|In the 1950's and 60's America got tired of hearing those words as it related to space flight. The Russians launched Sputnik before we had anything remotely resembling a satellite. Yuri Gagarin launched into an Orbital flight over a year before John Glenn achieved the feat. Names such as Titov, Leonov, Komarov, and Tereshkova (The first WOMAN in space) overshadowed names like Grissom, Shepard, Glenn and Lovell.<br /><br />And then came Armstrong...<br /><br />Well before his Historic Apollo 11 flight, Neil Armstrong made news (not to mention NASA history) when he and Dave Scott piloted the first docking in space with an Aegena booster.<br /><br />After that, the race was over.... or was it?<br /><br />Clearly the goal of being the first to the moon was accomplished. America won the first leg of the space race.<br /><br />What this series really points out, however, (if you look deep inside the meanings of the stories) is that the race truly isn't over. It's human nature to want to go a little bit father. A little bit faster. A little bit deeper. We only need the challenge of competition.<br /><br />Today, though we are working in conjunction with the former Soviet Union to colonize space, we still have the competitive spirit which compels us to be first at this, the only to do that or the ones to do this the longest (or most number of times.)<br /><br />Space records were made to be broken. Gherman Titov still holds the record for the youngest man to enter a space craft. John Glenn (at 77) broke Storey Musgrave's historic record of being the OLDEST person in space.<br /><br />The spirit of adventure is alive and well... and From The Earth To The Moon does a wonderful job of capturing the birth of this spirit and the development that continues well into the 21st century.<br /><br />It's more than a documentary. It's not merely a chronicle. It's an appeal to the world... an appeal to embrace the majesty that is space exploration.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Great movie. Hard, gritty and fast moving very much in the british tv tradition of underplaying the hero in <br />spy and police dramers.This movie has the feel of a mtv music vidio with fast changing camera angles and <br />radical high and low shots. I liked this movie because this is Bond, but with a 21st Century feel. Daniel Craig <br />brings a unique interpretation to the role of bond and deserves much praise.To conclude, see this movie, acting, stunts, fx, and direction are superb. This is one of the best Bonds. Bond has come of age in the 21st Century.
1582701709|1.0|After having read such books as Eckhart Tolle's new book(\\"The New Earth\\" which has been ambitiously promoted by Oprah), one is left to the inescapable conclusion that it's counter productive to entertain thoughts even if they are positive, otherwise we remain captive to the ego created stories/illusions such thinking fosters.  And by this narrow focus on what the conceptual \\"I\\" can accomplish for \\"me\\", this process remains forever intact.      Best to liberate ourselves from identification with thinking altogether as much as is humanly possible!

If you like echoes, they are there. <br /> <br />To the director, when you read the book (you did read it, didn't you?}, the information is presented in a logical order, building credability as the story progresses.  NOT as you did it: showing a brief history at the beginning of the movie in an effort to fill in the backstory.  This just made the move moot.   <br /> <br />Where is the continuity?  Where is the wonder?  Are those manniquins really dwarves?  I thought elves had pointed ears (like Mr. Spock, you friggin' idiot!).  Where is the bonding between Brom and Eragon?  Why does Saphira grow to adulthood in a few seconds?  How improbable is that?  Is this your first film?  If so, quit now.  As a director you lost the entire story. <br /> <br />My advice?  Read the books.  DON'T buy the DVD.  Especially if you don't have a home theater. <br /> <br />I'm sorry I did.
B0001US8EO|5.0|I don't care what others think, I believe that it's acceptable to compare this movie to Tombstone, starring Kurt Russell. I do not believe they set out to make a truly accurate movie with Tombstone. I believe their goal MUST have been simply to entertain, a la the spaghetti western...<br /><br />Costner and Kasdan set out to make an epic hollywood movie about a historical figure... to tell his life story in as interesting (but factual) manner as possible. Yes there were some inaccuracies, such as Virgil being shot on the same night Morgan was murdered, but they were minor compared to the TRUTH that went into this adventure...<br /><br />Wyatt Earp would likely be proud.
0374105235|5.0|Many times we insulate ourselves against the horrors of the world we live in.  This book exposes us to one of these horrors, mainly, children that are forced to kill in order to survive.  This is not a \\"feel good\\" book, but after reading it, we must all look around us and feel so grateful that we were not robbed of our childhood and forced to live in an adult world hell bent on destroying itself.  The turmoil of Sierra Leone is devasting, but the inhumane life of \\"boy soldiers\\" is even more tragic.  How Ishmael Beah or any other child can have a normal life after their experiences is beyond me.  GOD BLESS THESE CHILDREN!

1400049628|5.0|Desde que me enter&eacute; de la existencia de &eacute;ste libro siempre tuve la intenci&oacute;n de conseguirlo; como fan de los zombies y su universo gore, creo que un manual de c&oacute;mo sobrevivir y su intenci&oacute;n de apoyarte en tu supervivencia ya hac&iacute;a falta en el mercado. Es una inversi&oacute;n asegurada no s&oacute;lo para los que les gusta el mundo zombie si no que tambi&eacute;n como curiosidad es un excelente texto que te entretiene y te hace meditar sobre qu&eacute; acciones a tomar en un caso supuesto de una infecci&oacute;n.<br /><br />Definitivamente Brooks hizo su trabajo y la tarea con la que termin&oacute; la mayor parte del libro (me refiero a la segunda parte que es donde vienen casos en varias partes del mundo) es el broche de oro con la que cerr&oacute; su obra. Ahora no puedo esperar para comprar su otro libro \\"World War Z\\" que s&eacute;, como &eacute;ste, ser&aacute; una excelente inversi&oacute;n.<br /><br />El idioma est&aacute; en ingl&eacute;s pero su uso del lenguaje es tan sencillo que a&uacute;n con un ingl&eacute;s b&aacute;sico captar&aacute;s excelentemente bien el hilo de la historia. As&iacute; que el idioma no debe detenerte al considerar la compra de este magn&iacute;fico libro.<br /><br />******************<br /><br />Since I heard about this book I say: It's mine. As a zombie and gore fan I always think a complete survival guide was an imperative. A pretty asured investment not just for the fans but for the curious as well: it's interesting and makes you think about yourself in situations like that and the actions you'll aquire to survival.<br /><br />Brooks make his homework in all his work, and whit the second part (histories about situations over the world) he makes it all. I can't wait to buy the \\"World War Z\\".<br /><br />(This is all my review, the other things I write it's for spanish speakers only, good stuff... I just translate the essential has a good will thing.)
0783219695|5.0|There were a few \\"hollywood\\" inaccuracies that bothered me. For example, it was Meniere's disease, not an ear infection that plagued Al Shepard. Furthermore, it wasn't Menieres that kept him off Apollo 13. It was an administrative decision based on the need to give him and his rookie crew more time to train.<br /><br />Other than those minor nitpicks, I REALLY enjoyed this film. I didn't obsess over the missed details, mind you. This is, after all, a hollywood adaptation of Jim Lovell's recounting. Facts are going to be skewed a bit here and there. As entertainment value goes, it was wonderful! Suspenseful, emotional and, all-in-all, pretty close to the reality of the situation.<br /><br />As historical movies go, it actually wasn't too bad on accuracy. And what it lacked in accuracy, it more than made up for in sheer entertainment value.<br /><br />Jim Lovell's cameo in the end was the icing on the cake.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|I'm going to start off with this... as much as a LOVE comic books movies I originally didn't want to see this movie becasue of Katie Holmes, i'm not the biggest fan of her acting, and when i did see this movie she didn't impress me then either, but the rest of the cast is great!. <br /> <br />Batman Begins s a movie made for a home theater system, it has great visuals and an even better plot. Don't worry if you've never read any of the Batman comics, or if god forbid your only experience is with the previous Batman movies, since this is a reboot there is no previous history. <br /> <br />But why should you buy this edition instead of the one disk edition... two words, bonus features! I adore bonus features. The set includes mini documentaries galore, the trailer that helped get us pumped up months before the movie came out, and a mini comic book ( mini in size not length). However this movie is missing one of my favorite DVD features, the commentary, be it from the actors or the director i love watching movies with commentaries.  <br /> <br />All that being said, its a good buy, and i don't think you will be dissapointed.
1564148793|5.0|We don't assume that our \\"good intentions\\" will protect us if we run a red light or if we grab a live wire.  We don't think that \\"perfect love and perfect trust\\" will save us from injury if we jump off a cliff.  And yet many modern-day magicians think that the spirit world is utterly safe and exists only for our benefit, aggrandizement and ultimate Enlightenment. <br /> <br />Jason Miller knows better.  His  *Protection and Reversal Magick* gives the reader real protection against real threats ranging from spiritual nasties to vengeful exes.  If you're going to practice magic seriously (and if you aren't, you shouldn't practice at all), you will need to know how to protect yourself when things go wrong.  Reading Miller's book can save you the pain of learning spiritual warfare in the trenches.   <br /> <br />Miller's approach owes a great deal to his work in Hoodoo, his relationship with the Goddess Hekate, and his training in ceremonial magic(k).  This may raise some hackles among some who favor a more \\"Love and Light\\" centered approach.  But it's fitting for a book which is designed to teach you how to avoid getting psychically (or physically) injured by the nastier denizens of the spirit world.  (Miller also avoids becoming dogmatic: while he concentrates on Hekate, his methods can easily be adapted to working with other pantheons or deities).  <br /> <br />There are lots of Pagan books published every year: this one is a keeper.  Recommended to anyone who practices magic.
B000IU3Y3W|4.0|I like Neil Young. A lot. I will buy all of the performance series as they come out. The thing is if you have a fairly complete Neil Young catalog, or at least the major releases, you have already heard various live versions of everything on the CD. It is perhaps the original line-up that makes this group of songs any \\"different\\" and the historical context of the concert. Interesting to the hard-core fan; maybe not so to the casual one. As to the DVD, there is NO live footage on it. It's all photgraphs, although some good ones, faded in at out accompanied to the music on the CD. Special DVD features give you full screen stills of all of the performance pictures and pictures of some memorabilia from the concert like buttons, ticket stubs, play lists, hand written lyrics, etc. There is also some biographical info on the band members that's kinda cool. I had no idea that Crazy Horse's members figured so prominently in music, period! All in all, if you are a hard-core Neil Young fan and like everything by him live no matter how many versions you have previously heard, by all means buy this. The few extra bucks for the CD/DVD version is worth it if you are interested in the content I described above. If you are a casual fan and/or just like the music, buy the CD only version and save a few bucks. If you feel you already have enough Neil Young with your half dozen \\"major\\" albums by him, given that this content has all been covered in other works already, you could pass and not miss a thing.
B00062J00S|5.0|Forget your action movies, comedies and dramas of the 21st century. This classic film of a common, down on his luck \\"Everyman\\" who wishes he'd never been born is, by far, the best movie ever made!<br /><br />After a slight misstep by his bumbling Uncle Billy, George Bailey's \\"Building and Loan\\" comes up short 8,000 dollars. In a moment of desperation and depression, George Bailey considers throwing away God's greatest gift, his own life. Instead, Clarence -- an angel wishing to get his wings -- intervenes, hoping the good deed of saving George Bailey will cause a bell to ring...<br /><br />Why? Because \\"every time a bell rings... an angel gets his wings.\\"<br /><br />Instead of helping George take his own life, Clarence guides George through a \\"Christmas Carol\\" type story, where George is given a chance to see what the world would be like without him in it.<br /><br />Throw a pebble into a pond and the ripple effects are seen for quite some time. They grow and grown, covering more area, spreading farther and wider until they eventually reach the ends of the pond, lake, or ocean in which they sprang. In this tale, George Bailey gets a first-hand glimpse at exactly how far and wide the ripple effect of his own existence has reached.<br /><br />You can't buy that kind of spirit...<br /><br />(Note: Look for Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer as Frankie Othello in the Dance scene.)

B000053V7Q|5.0|Elvis in his prime,with more concert footage than the original, if I am not mistaken.  That's the Way It Is is also my favorite Elvis album.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas stands next to \\"L\\" as the most underrated rapper ever. I mean this album only went like 2 platinum, it should have gone diamond, at least!!! I don't think anyone's ever made rhymes better than these ones (though i prefer Tupac and Biggie to Nas) Nas is an incredible battler, and certainly in my top 5. Absolutely no filler here, all 9 tracks are amazing, with my favourite \\"NY State Of Mind\\".
B000006TRV|5.0|For those dissing The Wall, maybe you had to be there in the winter of 1979 when this came out.    There had already been Dark Side of the Moon and I was nearly obsessed with Animals - probably played it every day for two years.    But NO ONE saw this one coming... For crying out loud, Pink Floyd was about to have a NUMBER ONE single in America?!?    It changed everything. A masterwork, number one in America for nearly six months, the biggest selling double-disc album in history, the greatest rock album ever made...

0940985691|4.0|This was an interesting introduction to the subject and gave me some sense of what vedic astrology is about.  Like most of these books, it doesn't give you a guide to star gazing, which I think would add to the experience.  It also made it obvious to me that the subject is far too involved for one quick book reading.  I don't have the time or inclination to learn it in depth, but I would consider getting a software program that did most of the dirty work for me.
0553582461|5.0|I've been reading Robin Hobb's books since Assassin's Apprentice first caught my eye.  I've loved the world throughout and hope to see more of it in the future.  I believe that we may have seen the last of some of our most Beloved characters and I am desperately sorry for that; however they must have their Grey Haven.  There comes a point in any good story where it must end and Ms. Hobb's closes this one gracefully and in a manner that while unexpected fits the story.  I was not too enthusiastic about the first two Tawny Man books and Fool's Fate sat on my bookshelf for awhile before I got around to reading it.  I'm glad I did.  I trusted Ms. Hobb to see all her finely drawn characters safely to the end of their tale and she did.  She writes such real and vital characters at times I found myself sobbing on their behalf.  At one point I put the book down in despair, feeling like Fitz must have at that same time (and no, I'm not telling - you'll just have to read the book).  Anyway, the end is worth the wait.  My only disappointment is the bittersweetness of the whole thing.  I love the ending, but I will miss Fitz, the Fool and all the other so much.

B000M4RG42|3.0|This film would be hard to follow if you have not read the book.  The confusion over claims that the photograph was staged is included in the over long treatment of the bond tour without any explanation of the how and why this confusion occurred.  The subject should have either been fully explained or deleted from the movie.  Letters from Iwo Jima is a much better effort.
0743454537|1.0|This is the first of Jodi Picoult's books I've read and it will probably be the last.  Her \\"ripped from the headlines\\" subject matter provides the dramatic tension and she embellishes it with unbelievable characters and portentous language.  She tells this story with several voices of each of the major characters and all of the voices sound the same.  The character Anna sounds much too mature for a girl of her age.  The mother Sarah is  so singularly focused on her daughter Kate at the expense of the rest of her family, and so unable to recognize or respect personal boundaries as to be unrealistic and unbelievable.  The end is a cop-out--no hard decisions have to be made and no one bears the consequences of his or her decisions or actions.  I admit to a few tears and mild interest in the relationship between Anna's lawyer and her advocate ad litem, so the book was not torture to read.  I'd peg this below a John Grisham book.  His books are entertaining and satisfying beach books; this was an annoying and pretentious one.  Definitely not in the same camp as Sue Miller or Jane Hamilton.
006112429X|4.0|I have recently read and reviewed Jodi Picoult's book NINETEEN MINUTES and some of the other reviewers of that book had referred to WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN and since I had seen the book before and by-passed it, I thought now would be a good time to read it and compare.    While both books deal with a teenager who has committed a school mass murder, that's pretty much were the similarities end.  Picoult's book is told from the perspective of several different characters, Lionel Shriver's is told from the perspective of only one.  While Picoult's Peter is the victim of systematic bullying throughout his growing up, Shriver's Kevin is a \\"bad seed\\" from the day he's born.  While we know why Peter commits his crime, we are never quite sure why Kevin does it.    I found this story gripping.  Eva, Kevin's mother, explains in a series of letters to her husband Franklin her thoughts, feelings and opinions of life as Kevin's mothers.  Her reluctance to have a child, her inability to connect with Kevin and her ability to see Kevin for what he really is when her husband can't is incredible to read.  I found it interesting that she was so in love with a man whom represented everything she despised about America.  This is a story that is intense, powerful and disturbing.    I do have a couple of minor complaints, however.  I agree with what other reviewers have stated about the character of Celia.  We know very early on what Kevin is like.  Why bring into the story a sibling you know he will torture.  Celia was not a necessary character.  Also, I did find some of the writing to be incredibly pretentious (\\"Kevin's cynicism equally assured him that a malign, sadistic pedagogy would pitch him nothing but chaff.\\")  Whether this is merely Shriver's writing style, or she simply wanted Eva to come across as pretentious, I'm not sure, but it did get tiresome at times.    As for the twist ending, I had actually figured it out early on, than kept second-guessing myself.  When I found out I was right all along, it was still a shocker.  I recommend this book highly, as I do NINETEEN MINUTES.    Please read both.

0895260131|5.0|Westerners need to read this book.  We often make the mistake of thinking that those in the Arab\Muslim world think as we do, so we negotiate with them in like terms, hoping to achieve a peaceful coexistence.  However, if you're not one of them, all you are is an infidel and they will take any opportunity they can get to put themselves in a position of subjugating you - submission by volition or by force - the great battle cry of Islam.  To that end, nothing is taboo: stealing, killing, lying... you name it.  If this is a religion of peace, how is it that they are involved in EVERY current conflict worldwide.  Freedom loving people everywhere need to wake up!

This is truly a soul-wrenching, gorgeous, humane description of India and its people...and we are led into this journey by a man who is fearless and courageous in facing his fears to see the humanity that lies behind the fearsome poverty and chaos. <br />And so glad to see it's being made into a movie, by a director no less than Mira Nair and starring the talented Johnny Depp (a person who has the authenticity and sincerity to do full justice to linbaba, the affectionate name bestowed on the author by his best friend/Guide in Mumbai).  <br />This is a must read for anyone-whether just for a good story, or a rousing adventure, or a serious look at the Indian soul...or any soul for that matter. You will be changed and enlightened.
B000067J1I|5.0|BIG,is indeed 1988's highest-grossing film. Laverne & Shirley veteran Penny Marshall directs Tom Hanks in this comedy about a pre-teen boy who wishes he was taller than his actual four-foot(estimate) height. The juvenile Josh Baskin,played by an infamous actor,is at a carnival with a buddy or two,and makes the aforementioned wish. So when he goes to bed that night,he wakes up as the adult Josh(Hanks). Suddenly,he's working at a white collar business and falls in love with a female colleague(Elizabeth Perkins). Josh's mother(Mercedes Ruehl) suspected that the kid Josh was kidnapped by the adult Josh! The adult Josh tries to explain to his 30ish-40ish mother that his height increased suddenly. In the final scene,Josh is back to his kid self. Great support from Saturday Night Live veteran Jon Lovitz(MR. DESTINY,CITY SLICKERS 2). Interestingly,this film was theatrically released twice in 1988,first on June 10 and again on December 23. This was one of the very best of Hanks' film career,inarguably. Hanks' fans loved him also in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE,YOU'VE GOT MAIL,SPLASH,THE MONEY PIT,CAST AWAY and of course,FORREST GUMP.
B000I5XOVY|5.0|Although I have seen the movie years ago when it was on cinemas across the world and of course on dvd several times, I bought the blu-ray version in order to see the difference. I must admit that the experience was incredible and during the scenes that John Travolta was firing to the FBI agents and Hugh Jackman was driving, it was like that I have been on the street, in the middle of the crossfire. <br /> <br />If you want to experience the blu-ray difference, I strictly recommend the movie. That's how you see the development from DVD to Blu-Ray.

B0000009OU|5.0|In my quest to redisover the bespectaled one, I found a used copy of reissue 1 of Elvis' second album - if you know anything about the latest record biz reissue craze, it's that they keep remastering and reissuing some classic albums over and over again in slightly different forms; for Elvis he is on his third round of reissues, but I'm just buying used for now. This Year's Model found our boy a tad more angry than on his debut and with the help of newly recruited the Attractions, he found some keyboards and jumpy punk rock. Arguably, the roughest and loudest of Elvis' albums, featuring the cynism and adorable aggravation of Elvis, the album contains some of my favorite Elvis songs ever like \\"Pump It Up\\", \\"Little Triggers\\", \\"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea\\" and with this re-release, the single \\"Radio Radio\\". If you haven't started investigating early Costello yet, I may have to stop talking to you... next on our Elvis list is what will probably be my favorite Elvis album Armed Forces if for nothing other than I think \\"Oliver's Army\\" is the ultimate Elvis song.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I first heard The Fratellis back in the Late Summer/Early Fall '06 on BBC-1 radio on my computer. I thought-clever, whimsy,strong Scottish beats, they have a retro feel but from unknown era. New Punk Pop. \\"Chelsea Dagger\\" reminds me of a T-Rex anthem and fun to learn the words to. \\"Baby Fratelli\\" makes you feel like your sitting in a pub with a pint in a big sing along. \\"Whistle for the Choir\\" is a calmer ballad that just gets in your head for days. The popular favorite \\"Flathead\\" makes you want to jump and dance (just like in the IPod commercial). I couldn't wait till the album was released in the States. If you like the Scottish punk pop wave...you won't be disappointed.
B000P6PVLC|2.0|My wife and I looked at eachother with one eyebrow raised basically saying \\"huh?\\" The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because a couple of the stories were actually interesting, however, they just didn't go anywhere and I was left disappointed.

B000EGDC14|3.0|I wanted to love this album I really did. After all, Goldfrapp's last album Black Cherry is so good I can't help but drag it out of the CD case at least once every couple of months but instead of taking the brilliance of that last album and moving forward instead it's like they just stopped progressing or even worse regressed a little. \\"Ooh La La\\" opens the album in a fairly promising way but after that it all becomes a bit samey; the highlight to me is the raunchy-ish sounding (in title and music) \\"Ride The White Horse\\" but the lyrics aren't exactly what I thought they'd be. The problem with Supernature isn't that it isn't a good album, because it is, but it's not anywhere near as good as the last album. Where \\"Strict Machine\\", \\"Train\\" and \\"Twist\\" from Black Cherry are practically this millenium's dance anthems, everything off of Supernature just falls flat compared. If you are looking for some Goldfrapp my advice is to avoid this and get your sweaty dancy hands on Black Cherry because that album doesn't disappoint in the way Supernature does.

B000089RV6|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time and if you don't believe me check any registered music critic's top 100 list and you'll see it there somewhere. Not only is it a fun album and one that brings constant memories of high school flooding back to me; it really is a very well put together record. Coming off the death of lead singer Bon Scott, the Young boys and their co-horts hopped onto the Brian Johnson wagon and headed into the studio. With the fists to the air and groin to the ground \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" this album was off and running all over the world. The sound on the remaster is excellant and so are the liner notes some of which make you really listen to the album. The mixture of old blues and hard rock is more evident than I originally had even thought of and just the hard rocking fun of the title track, the grinding \\"Rock & Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" and \\"Giving The Dog A Bone\\" is just plain exciting. If you haven't heard it in a while I highly suggest you throw that old cassette into the boom box and give it another go - or better yet get this remaster, I know you want it.
B000002J3W|4.0|Honest magazines of the time agreed that this rocked mightily. But it was 1995 and they were few and far between as it was basically illegal to like Skid Row at the height of grunge and alterna-rock hegemony.<br /><br />But bugger the mainstream - this rocked! A mature slice of corporate metal still with Bachs trademark pipes soaring and growling their way through tunes that had more in common with Slave to the Grind than the debut. Which is as you'd expect. Heavy rockers abound here as hard riffing is the order of the day, personal faves bein the lead cut My Enemy, the title track and Medicine Jar. That's not to deny the impassioned Bach efforts on Frozen or Beat Yourself Blind. And the band weren't above a few gimmicks, such as the single Breakin' Down being issued in two versions, effectively trying to double sales for the single. But hey, Maiden relentlessly issue all sorts of versions of everything to siphon the last cent (or pence) from their fans wallets and let's not even start on KISS! So I can forgive 'em and really this solid metal outing should of sufficed to silence critics and to ensure the bands survival.<br /><br />Other tidbits you may find helpful in making your choice would be A) bob Rock production, B) nifty foldout packaging on the initial pressing and C) a defiant will to win. Though to be fair, reasons not to buy this would be A) not quite the kill factor of Slave to the Grind, B) knowing the band were disintegrating from within - yeah it's a downer and C) the absence of chilling slower numbers - there is nothing approaching In A Darkened Room, Wasted Time or Quicksand Jesus.<br /><br />Still, recommended metal.
B000M3452Y|4.0|Yeah, so there are a lot of late 70's and 80's influences. If that frightens you, take a stress pill and relax like Frankie. It's the good stuff, the stuff that made us press rewind when that meant something. Is it deep? No. Is it The Best Album Of the Decade? Probably not. Is it the most fun you'll have for slightly less than an hour, for many hours, of the kind you thought no one made anymore? Hell yeah, son. And try not to dance. I dare ya.
B00000DGUM|3.0|Sebastian Bach took no part in this project stating he didn't feel the band who put out three studio LP's and a couple of EP's could be encapsulated on a single disc. I bet he didn't say no to any royalty cheques though. For all his great singing Bach is wrong - with 16 tracks on show it shoud of been easy to put together a platter which would of blown up stereos worldwide. The band has the back catalogue to do it that's for sure.<br /><br />But the release of what purports to be the hard rock cum metallers most killer cuts is effectively hobbled by the track listing. The first ten tracks rip righteously. Youth Gone Wild, Monkey Business, Slave to the Grind etc are all present and accounted for. But criminally none of the towering tryptich of disturbing ballads of the Slave to the Grind album are here - no Wasted Time, In A Darkened Room or Quicksand Jesus. It's not like these were obscure tracks - they were singles with videos done for them - you'd expect a bands singles to be on their 'best of' wouldn't you?!?<br /><br />The other major problem found herein is the seven odds 'n' sods tracks. There are uneventful/rubbish remix or demo versions of songs plus a live take of Been Yourself Blind from the Subhuman Race album. Now it's pretty good, by why not put stuff like that onto the Jap EP Subhuman Beings on tour EP and make a full live album? Of course we get a couple of unreleased toons - a demo from the Slave to the Grind sessions pluse a number from '88 - Forever. The point is nothing here adds anything to the story of Skid Row and takes up the room that should of been given to their actual great tracks.<br /><br />This album scores three stars for the first 9 tracks (OK - the unreleased Forever is pretty cool in a numbskull teenyrocker way) but what frustrates me is how awesom this collection could of been if it was a genuine best of. Which this band so thoroughly deserve. Now 16 tracks of their best numbers - THAT collection would score five stars with no dramas at all.o dramas at all.
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|THIS IS GOING TO BE A CLASSIC. It shocks and amazes. Truly a masterpiece. <br />The fact that this is a combo disk, is also brilliant. Can't wait to see who wins the HD DVD / BLURAY fight.
0783226837|5.0|What a hoot!  A great cast that plays this crazy story perfectly straight.  They get us to buy into every bit of the story no matter how wrong every \\"scientific\\" premise of the story is.  Each of the characters is colorful and we root for them in the way they individually deal with the crisis of these \\"new\\" creatures attacking their valley home.<br /><br />Valentine McKee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are the closest thing to heroes and normal among the males in the movie.  They become the leaders and the ones the plot leans on.  The most colorful characters are Burt and Heather Gummer (Michael Gross and Reba McEntire) as the survivalist couple with enough food storage and weaponry to stand for five years against an invading army.  The Michael Gross character is the one who is in all four movies and a few episodes of the TV series based on the movies.  Although, a few others lasted through one or more of the sequels (think of Tony Genaro's Miguel).  However, this is the best of the series.<br /><br />Victor Wong, whom we greatly miss, is terrific as the local shop owner, Walter Chang.  In every role I have seen him play, I enjoy his presence and think he makes the movie better.<br /><br />I guess the whole \\"Dune\\" series made the idea of large worms that could move through dirt as easily as a fish through water more believable.  And the monsters in this movie are quite good.  Because they are underground we believe that all the moving dirt, floors, walls, and machines to be the results of those things being down there and threatening not only the characters, but us!  We don't want to get eaten by them any more than they people inhabiting the movie.<br /><br />And while things get worse and worse for the cast, we still enjoy their inventiveness in trying to get out.  That worms are as intelligent as these seem to be does require another leap of faith.  But we are willing to make it for this story.<br /><br />Lots of fun!

1594481938|1.0|It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.  <br /> <br />I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so.

He has to get these diamonds from Lao Che (Roy Chiao), but Lao poisons Indy and it becomes a brawl for the diamond and the antidote.<br />  Seems like Indy has a new lady partner for this adventure as he takes a hold of her hand and jumps out a window and ultimately is saved by his trusty 11-year old driver, Short Round (Ke Huy Quan, now Jonathon Ke Quan).

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Has a great selection of songs from the 1st season.  I like show/movie CDs that you can picture the scenes and emotion of the actors when you hear the song.  The Celtic underlays are great, and the Taiko drumming style is very well used for building intensity in the music.  If you really like the series, you should probably really enjoy the music as well!
B00004TVG7|5.0|This music is almost like hearing ghosts.  In a way the listener does hear ghosts, for the music has been saved from oblivion, and experts do not know everything about it.  As much as possible, traditional instruments have been reconstructed based on pictures found on documents like vases and paintings.  Sometimes you hear only a little fragment of something, about a minute.  It's intriguing to think about who may have sung/played this music.  The notes explain some of the technical details; musicologists will find that interesting.  Because I know little about music, I wish for better notes about other things.  For example, I would like more information in English about provenance, titles, and lyrics--as far as they are known.  I wanted to know the words I heard sung.  Other than the shortage of helpful notes, this is very interesting music.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Buy this movie and I dare you not to turn around and buy some of Wood's films.  I saw this movie years ago but did not care for it because at the time I was too young to appreciate the humor.  Now that I have seen it again for the first time, I immediately went out and bought Wood's box set.   <br />As far as the movie is concerned, Burton turns the sad and macabre into light humor.  Bela Lugosi is portrayed, if you've even seen his movies before, very well by Landau.  Depp is perfect as cross dressing Wood.  And my personal favorite:  Watch for Murray's speech about his trip to Mexico.  I about died laughing.

I do believe that we need to learn a lot from the way they were dressed going back home. Africans of the past were very modest people they did not show their skin in public. The story needs to be redone with better and truer facts. Africans were the founders of civilizations dress is important to civil behavior.
073510073X|1.0|I feel for the HSPs in the world.  In many respects, I am one.  However, this book had a pervasive pointlessness to it.  Despite the promising title, the book offers little of substance.  What's worse, it thoroughly confounds two separate traits: emotional sensitivity and sensitivity to one's environment.  The two are vastly different and jamming them into one trait, \\"sensitive,\\" misses much ground for exploration.  I was excited to start the book the first time I started it...and I never got very far.  I started it again a year or so later wondering, \\"why was it again that I never got very far in this book?\\"  I figured that out rather quickly.  I doubt I'll pick up this book a third time.

B000MGUZKM|5.0|It is amazing that this great collaboration took until now to happen. There was magic when Randy recorded the hit \\"Steet Life\\" with Joe Sample when he was still with the Crusaders back in 1979, and now we can enjoy an entire album of this terrific musical chemistry.  Randy is one of the best and most underrated R & B/jazz singers, with her warm vibrato, fresh <br />phrasing, backed up by Joe Sample's distinctive piano style - aggressive, <br />yet spare enough to complement rather than override Randy's vocals. <br /> <br />The title song \\"Feeling Good\\" is a fresh and upbeat reinterpretation of the original standard, and better than anyone else's version I have heard. <br />From  \\"Rio de Janeiro Blue\\" to \\"Sealine Woman\\" Randy spins her tales with <br />a quality that has no limits, and, although these are my favorites, every song on this album is a gem. <br /> <br />If you want to witness Joe and Randy live, check out the studio session on Youtube of \\"Street Life\\".  It appears to have been done recently, about the same time as the making of this album.
B00022M518|2.0|Although this album pretty much started the Indie music genre that we know today, it just really isn't, umm, ANY GOOD!

B0002IQEHI|5.0|This is by far one of Cary Grant's best films. We now own the collection of most Alfred Hitchcock movies and actually play a game while watching them, for invariably he appears during his films. We watch and see who can spot his cameo appearances... my favorite is when Mr. Hitchcock is part of a portrait... so we had a devil of a time finding him during the movie. <br /> <br />North by Northwest was produced in 1959 and it has a recipe of romance, intrigue, thrilling action, and mystery that produces a brilliant performance by Cary Grant. <br /> <br />Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, an advertising executive who is erroneously kidnapped by enemies of a certain George Kaplan, supposedly a United States undercover agent. Mr. Thornhill is drugged but escapes and a fascinating series of events start to shape the plot. During this film, we see the appearance of great actors from Mission Impossible, the Man from Uncle, and other shows, which keep us at the edge of our seat with their mystery, thrilling action, and romance.  <br /> <br />Eva Marie Saint plays the part of the woman Cary Grant falls for. She is sexy, elegant, poised... and the two engage in some of the most interesting dialogue, which at some point, culminates in the most interesting of romantic kisses ever produced by Hollywood. <br /> <br />The filming in New York City allows the audience to travel through Manhattan in the 50's and it is amazing how it all remains the same, and yet due to security... it is all so very different, especially with regards to visiting the United Nations, where there is a stabbing not to be missed for it is something that could not take place in today's terms. <br /> <br />The end of the movie is a classic cliffhanger that takes place atop the stone faces of Mount Rushmore! Do not miss this movie! Cary Grant at his best!
B0002U0UKS|4.0|Joe Hisaishi will never cease to amaze Miyazaki watchers. His music is as beautiful as ever, with the lovely themes and the wonderful tracks. This score, while perhaps not as good as \\"Spirited Away\\", or as darkly fascinating and memorable as \\"Princess Mononoke\\", is light and lovely in its own way.<br /><br />Each theme is beautiful in its own way. The \\"Merry-go-round\\" theme (which repeats itself in some form or other throughout most of the songs and is drop-dead gorgeous) comes in the form of plucked strings, a bassoon, high woodwinds, and the piano. Some songs take advantage of specific instruments, like \\"Wandering Sophie\\" and the bassoon, or \\"Secret Cave\\" and the beautiful flute opening. Some songs take on that lower, darker quality that Hisaishi used in \\"Mononoke\\", and achieve it beautifully (once again, \\"Secret Cave\\"). The trumpet gets a solo, too, in \\"The Boy Who Accepted a Star\\".<br /><br />\\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" incorporates many themes and types of music, making it diverse, lovely, and wonderful. If only it didn't cost such an outrageous price! It's worth it, but should be offered for less.

0451191153|4.0|\\"The Fountainhead\\" was the first of Ayn Rand's works that I read. After reading \\"We the Living\\", I understand her a little more, but I think that this still lags behind.<br /><br />Ayn Rand is a good writer, but even lovers of long fiction will find this to be a little extreme. Rand took an interesting idea and puffed it up into a huge novel. It was fascinating. It was good. But still? There were times where it was just \\"wow, ease up a bit\\".<br /><br />The thing is, I didn't find it boring for a moment. I was sucked in from the first word and I wasn't able to put it down until I finished. The story constantly moved and shifted, and if a part was boring, it was because someone had decided to have a four-page long monologue. A bit long-winded, a bit dull.<br /><br />For the most part, though, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is fascinating. I thought the characters were interesting because they were so vivid and different. I liked the plotline, and I liked the characters. I thought the ending was interesting. It's a good piece of fiction, though it would probably be better if Rand had cut back on some of the too-long speeches some of the characters are prone to giving. I didn't find it as well-written or good as \\"We the Living\\" (which I actually read after this, and really liked), but this is still good. It's a challenge any serious reader should take on.<br /><br />If you read \\"We the Living\\", know that this isn't as good. If you're new to Rand and want to take on the challenge, start out here. It's a good jumping off point.
B0007OASII|5.0|The Black Halo is the second part of a story based around German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's version of Faust, following main characters Ariel, Helena, and Mephisto. The first part was Kamelot's previous album, Epica, and as such is basically mandatory listening for anybody who really wants to get the full experience out of The Black Halo. However, for the stubborn among us - Epica covers Ariel's abandonment of everything he has known in order to begin pursuit of the answers to the great mysteries of life. Unfortunately, things don't quite work out for him in the wide world, and he begins to long for the promising days of youth. This subsequently leads into his meeting with Mephisto, who - being the devil in disguise - arrives in the shape of a beautiful woman when Ariel is at his lowest and offers him all the pleasures a man could want. Ariel temporarily succumbs to Mephisto's offers and abandons his search. He indulges in \\"the life\\", as it were - food, drink, women, et al - and goes on to sign a contract with Mephisto that will turn out to be the proverbial deal with the devil. After all of this, he encounters his childhood love - Helena. They share a moment together, and Ariel learns that she is pregnant with his child, but Ariel ends up pushing her away in fear that the deal he had just made with Mephisto would bring her too much suffering... and as a result, Helena drowns herself in the river. Ariel becomes trapped between Mephisto's malevolence and Helena's goodness (who reappears as an angel), and Epica essentially ends there. The Black Halo, in turn, starts off with a depiction of the absolute peak of Mephisto's power over Ariel. The album sees Ariel given another chance at love (which he also rejects), and consequently descends into a dark conflict that takes place entirely in his mind. Several enlightening realizations bring him to a final confrontation with Mephisto, a tragic reunion with Helena, and ultimately culminate in a scene that portrays his death and takes the listener back to the very beginning of the overall saga. There are many little details, nuances, twists, and turns to discover along the way, but I'll leave that up to you. Suffice it to say, the concept is very well thought-out and quite moving. <br /> <br />The album features various guest musicians, including -  guitarist Thomas Youngblood's wife Mari as the voice of Helena, Dimmu Borgir's Shagrath as the voice of Mephisto, Epica's Simone Simons as the character Marguerite, a full blown professional choir (dubbed the Kamelot Choir), the Rodenberg Symphony Orchestra, Stratovarius' Jens Johansson on keyboards, and more. <br /> <br />Impressive. Most impressive. <br /> <br />The music is rooted firmly in a power metal aesthetic. However, this is the most plausible form of power metal I have ever heard. I'm not even a fan of power metal - I could never get into the trite and boring high fantasy themes, extreme falsetto vocal nonsense, flat and predictable musicianship, and overall feeling of dreadful cheese. Kamelot, on the other hand, seem to take this inherently disastrous genre of metal and completely drop everything that makes it so laughable, substituting instead a sincere sense of sweeping power, genuine emotion, and soaring drama.  <br /> <br />The band, from an instrumental perspective, manage to not completely fall into the trappings of their chosen genre. Save for a few essential performances from Jens Johansson (for example, his lead in the middle of \\"March of Mephisto\\" which is supposed to act as the devil's instrument), there aren't any obnoxious keyboard leads to be found here. The drums extend past incessant double bass marathons, offering moments of impactful glory (also best exemplified on \\"March of Mephisto\\"), and even some time signature changeups. The guitars range from high-speed tremolo riffing to mid-tempo work that can be quite heavy but never grates on the listener's ears; the guitar leads are highly melodious and fitting to the atmosphere of a given song and its place within the progression of the story, never really descending into pointless wankery. However, the real gem here is vocalist Roy Khan. He has immense range, but chooses to hang around the mid vocal registers for much of his delivery, which makes those moments where he extends up high or drops down low that much more moving. Those allergic to power metal shouldn't get discouraged by the \\"up high\\" comment... he doesn't indulge in the kind of over the top vocal acrobatics many have come to expect from this genre; he simply changes things up occasionally to keep a dynamic flow and stay with the mood of the song. Furthermore, his voice is filled with a fiery passion that's perfect for getting across the feelings and depicting the internal conflicts of the main character, Ariel... and he has several absolutely breathtaking performances throughout - namely, his duet with guest vocalist Simone Simons on \\"The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)\\", and his bone-chilling delivery on \\"Abandoned\\" that's multiplied ten-fold by the stellar backing of orchestra and choir. <br /> <br />There are three interludes during the course of The Black Halo that aren't really songs, but serve as transitionary performances that bring to light critical aspects of the storyline. The second of these, \\"Interlude II - Un Assassinio Molto Silenzioso\\" (translates into \\"A Very Silent Murder\\"), features Italian singer Cinzia Rizzo who's performance is of note. The third interlude, dubbed \\"Interlude III - Midnight, Twelve Tolls For A New Day\\", is also quite significant in that it depicts Ariel's final glimpse of Helena approaching him just before the moment of his death. His pained uttering of her name brings the album proper to a close. There is another song to be found afterwards, though. \\"Serenade\\" isn't part of the album's story, but is a joyous and upbeat song that is essentially a glorious celebration of life. <br /> <br />There are several other moments I'd like to briefly discuss. <br /> <br />The first is the opening track, \\"March of Mephisto\\". This song is just so unbelievably powerful. It's meant to represent the peak of Mephisto's influence over Ariel, and it gets this feeling across admirably as the united, methodical pulsing of drums and guitars sounds like a massive mustering of Mephisto's armies and their inevitable march to war with Mephisto himself snarling at their backs. As another reviewer said, it's like a freaking revolution. I can only imagine what kind of reaction this song garners in a live setting. <br /> <br />The second is the track \\"Memento Mori\\". Being the longest song that Kamelot have written to date (at around nine minutes), it sees Ariel, Helena, and Mephisto together one final time. The staple of this song is the line \\"I am the God in my own history\\", where Ariel finally realizes that he has the power to control his own destiny and casts Mephisto from his mind. Powerful performances from Roy, Mari, and Shagrath. <br /> <br />...and that's about it. <br /> <br />The Black Halo is like the \\"anti-power metal\\" power metal album, or maybe it's the purest embodiment of what power metal was always meant to become. Either way, it's a stunning, gorgeous, and intelligent album that I would recommend whether you're a fan of metal or not. <br /> <br />Not to be missed.

B00009RDG9|5.0|The Hunted is one of those films that might not be defensible. It might no practical, ethical, moral reason to exist. Except, of course, that it is thrilling, involving, brutal, gory, and highly entertaining.<br /><br />The Hunted involves a Special Forces assassin, played by Benicio Del Toro, who begins to kill people in the Oregon woods using his highly evolved knife fighting and tracking skills. The FBI calls a former Special Forces tracker/knife fighting trainer, played by Tommy Lee Jones to help find the assassin. He meets up with the assassin, and discovers that it's one of his old students.<br /><br />From here, the movies involves into a classic cat-and-house game between the two men with the FBI in the middle. The knife fighting is realistic and intense. Yes, this film is full of machismo and violence. But it's also full of heavy-duty emotions connected to issues of service, guilt, and betrayal.<br /><br />The Hunted is certainly not for everyone, but many will find it appealing and engrossing.

0812550757|3.0|Initially I liked this one better than Ender's Game, but the ending... well, it kind of petered out. It was a slower paced book, with a lot smaller and less impressive climax. By the end I was getting that \\"okay, okay, get on with it!\\" feeling. The concept of a \\"speaker for the dead\\" is very interesting and compelling, but that was explained at the end of Ender's Game and so it lessened the impact it might have had in this book had it been the first mention of it. I had time between the books to think it over and draw a lot of my own conclusions. I did, however, like the character of Jane quite a bit, despite her small role. I guess the AI personality was just very intriguing as a evolutionary concept. I'd still highly rate this book, but I'm back to thinking Ender's Game was the better story.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|The arm is entirely adjustable and clears my desk area with a simple push. <br />One defect that I noticed is the ratchet adjustable verticle swivel point is loose at the connection and there is no apparent way to tighten it.
1904233023|4.0|Far, far better than Enchantment, I do have to say that this is pretty heavy for a juvenile book. The ideas and concepts presented about war are interesting, and the ending is really amazingly well done. The \\"speaker for the dead\\" concept is different from what we hold to now (no one ever seems to saw anything bad about the dead) but I think far better. I'm not sure if the second book can live up to the first, though I will read it as I am very curious to see how Ender's life progresses. Not for the faint of heart, but a thoroughly thought-provoking book.
B00067BBQE|5.0|recently seeing Amy Lee and the boys in concert, i had to have a live cd, and find out more about them.....i have loved there music since there 1st album and love it more now..this DVD was amazing to me, i liked every aspect of it, it showed behind the scenes and live conserts and videos....i enjoyed it very much, just like i did their consert....i wouldnt have it any other way. <br />This is haunting music that is different in everyway, its like eveytime i listen to any of her songs, i am swept away to some sort of crazy/mixed up fairytale..... <br />Buy this DVD, and enjoy Evanescence for yourself over and over in your own home....u have my word u will like it!!!!! <br />
1400079179|1.0|This was, to me, a mildly good action-adventure book that took the \\"suspense\\" a little too far. After awhile, the \\"on the edge\\" excitement got wearing and it would have been nice to have a breather. The mini mysteries were fun, but most of the religious symbolism was lost on me. I wouldn't say it was anything grand or amazing, but I don't feel cheated out of those hours of my life, either.
B000002UDB|5.0|I love this Cd. Even though the horrible movie, this is a cd that is worth to have, because it has pretty good songs. If you are a passing by beatles fan or a hardcore beatles fan, you must have it
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This is a great package esp. with the bonus tracks. It can be invigorating and also relaxing.
1932100660|5.0|There are many ideologies based on our current pyriad-model of nutrional thinking; we have been born, raised and taught to raise our children with this model.  I had know idea how inaccurate this model is.  I am a high school teacher and I was amazed, make that, appalled, at our government's continued cover-up that perseveres for corporate-profit sake when our nation's health is at stake.  I applaud Dr. Campbell for having the courage to stand up to these powerful forces who at times can hold your very future in their hands. I applaud Dr. Campbell for having  taken a stand to let us know what the truth is so that we as rightful individuals can make INFORMED choices about our health and nutrition!  This book is for EVERYONE, parents, teachers, and those who want to take control of their health and not leave it up to chance any longer.  This book was reccomended by my husband's doctor for him to read and I am the one who couldn't put it down.  If you would have told me that I would be drinking soy milk and eating only plant-based, whole foods (even on my 11-day vacation in the Dominque Republic!)based on one book I would have told you you were crazy...but it is true.  This book has truly changed our family's lives.  Thank  You. <br /> <br />

B000AYEL6U|4.0|North and South co-mingle the beauty, elegance and virtue of one part of England's past, with the cruel reality of it's industrial other side. On the one hand you have the godly, chaste and beautiful Miss Margaret Hale, and on the other, the beast, in the person of John Thornton. I love the display of reality that was present during the cruel days of Englands inner city life, with the hardships of life in it's poverty stricken areas. But I also relished in the beauty, the scenery and manners of the middle and upper classes, where civility reigned. The only reason I couldn't give this excellent film a 5 star rating was because it was a little long, it was a little too focused on the harshness of the Mill and their workers. The love story and juicy parts came towards the middle and end of the film, where you know the beauty and the beast just had to break their respective independent hard shells, and start falling for each other. I also liked the fact that the Parson of the story was not presented in a negative light, but just as another bloke that was struggling to make ends meet. The female character of North and South Miss Margaret Hale, occasionally showed the cracks of her humanity but overall, she was articulate, beautiful, chaste, and very lady like. The character of John Thornton was steely, hard, and at times mean. But once you get to the point of discovering why he was that way, and what he had to go through to pick himself up by his bootstraps, your opinion of him will gradually change. But throughout the whole film, you want these two to get together, but only when the conditions are right. And then, you'll agree that they were made for each other.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Pretty much for anyone who ever loved, liked, or mildly enjoyed The Who.  It's a rocumentary that just blows every other in its genre out of the water!
0374105235|5.0|Wow, this book is raw, real and eye opening to those of us who sit in our cozy homes. I had to keep reminding myself that I wasn't reading a story that took place centuries ago. It's recent, it's today, it's happening all over the world. My heart ached for Ishmael as I turned each page. He was only a young boy witnessing and participating in such terror. He is an inspiration to me and I know to many who have and will read this book. I hope one day to have an opportunity to hear more about him and his success as a thriving young man here in the United States. Thank you for opening my eyes to the real world.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|This is definately Amon Amarth's best album to date, and that is saying a lot.  I've been a fan of these guys' Viking influenced Death metal for a long time.  What really sets Amon Amarth apart from typical Death metal is the fact that they have a lot of melody to their work.  There's a lot of high tremolo picking and whatnot.  Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of double bass to go around, there's just an overall epic feel to their sound.  So what makes this album so special?  It just seems as if they pushed their song writing up a few notches.  You can pretty much understand their singer and everything he's saying.  The solos have gotten alot better.  These guys really set it off with this record!  This is definately up there for one of the bests of 2006.
B000MV8ABS|2.0|Yep, like many viewers I watched this when I was too young and was scared for like weeks on end and couldnt get the tall man image out of my head. Well, when this got re-released I just \\"had\\" to have it figuring it would bring back memories and really allow me to get into once again. Unfortunately because I am now older and hopefully a little wiser, the film ends up being a rather cheesey horror movie with a mix-mash plot and NO tension or scary moments whatsoever.    Hey, I wasnt looking for a Dustin Hoffman like performance in a horror movie but geeez the acting was pretty rough and forced. The plot started off pretty cool but then began to not know what to do with itself and got almost silly towards the end. The mausoleum itself was eerie but the dwarf guys (Star Wars Jawas?) were pretty funny and the whole thing just didnt add up. As always in horror films a quick call to the police is all it would have taken to stop this Tall man, but no.... lets grab the trusty shotgun and take care of it ourselves...... c'mon.    The scene with the plastic bug in the jacket made me laugh outloud and I rewound it just to get another laugh. The film makers had to know how silly this looked.... didnt they?  I hope that scene was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek or the film makers need to rethink their film careers. And of course, the thought process of the characters just didnt make any logical sense. I wont go into details, you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.  Oh yeah, the mustard-covered fingers was also a classic laugh moment.    The silver fyling ball is still cool as hell and that alone earned the movie an extra star rating from me. I do like Jody, he tries to do the right things for the most part and has that waaaay cool 'Cuda that he drives around.  Little Mike was just a young kid and you almost felt bad for him losing so many people he cared for.... it had to be tough.  However, that doesnt excuse the inherent silliness of the movie or the plot that just doesnt unfold correctly or logically.  Maybe I expected too much, maybe I've become an overly-critical movie watcher, but nontheless, I cant recommend this other than for a quick watch.  Rent it, dont buy it since it has really zero redeeming qualities or multiple-viewing value.    This could have been soooooo much better with a the proper direction and a little more time put into the films flow. It was  a great concept for horror. Sci-Fi thrown in with mystical elements as well. Great starting point and it was refershingly different as opposed to the usual \\"10 kids go camping and get hacked by an ax murderer\\" [...] that you always see. Again though....it was NOT polished at all and just didnt work well enough.    Sorry If I've burst the proverbial bubble of the movies fans. But, its a \\"cult\\" classic for a reason. Much like the Rocky-Horror Picture Show, the event is the real attraction for the fans...the movie itself is horrible and pointless but fans dont want to face that fact so they hide behind the \\"cult classic\\" label.  Hey, whatever.... :)    By the way: The DVD quality is only average.  I expected a better transfer but on my plasma based Home theater, it was pretty grainy and not up to par with  what a re-release should be, IMO.    [...]

B00005JMXX|1.0|What made this movie a \\"disaster\\" in and of itself was the miserable acting, ridiculous characters, aweful casting, and worst plotwork I've ever come across. An attempt at using the \\"Independence Day\\" movie-making formula that went way too far. Even the movie cover picture seems borrowed from the original Planet of the Apes. I won't get into the science or politics because that's not why I watched this movie. There are plot-spoliers ahead. Altough, this plot was already spoiled on its own.    Watching Quaid awkwardly trying to choke out big scientific terms was like watching Homer Simpson trying to recite Shakespeare. All of the other actors, except for Iam Holm, were even worse to the point of ridiculousness, and not just the characters that were -supposed- to be ridiculous.    In the span of 24 hours we have a global iceage disaster. Scientist Dad in PA gets out his snowshoes and promises to walk to his teenage son in NYC in the middle of the nightmarish weather onslaught that is wiping out billions of people in 150 degrees below zero with storms and floods.  Right. And what does he plan to do if gets there and if is son is still alive and if he can find him? Freeze to death together? Give him a sandwich? Take a nice stroll to Mexico in 150-below-zero?  With millions of people at hand, his son either would have been with some of them surviving already without the help of hero Dad, or he was dead like everyone else, or he relocated.   But no. We have our hero dad plodding along on foot unscathed in in the middle of an ongoing planetary disaster, the only person out of millions capable of doing this and surviving, to find sonny-boy and his cutesie friends, who just happen to be the few survivors in the city because dad was a smart enough scientist to tell them to light a fire and stay warm. I won't even bother listing the all the other unbearable shortcomings of this movie.    The final stake through the heart was the escaped-wolf nonsense, which takes the cake as one of the stupidest most desperate attempts at plotwork or adventure I've ever seen. 3 unrealistic computer-generated wolves just happen to escape the zoo, survive the overnight destruction of the whole city and its population, make their way across the city to find our little heroes and harass them the instant they stick a toe out the door. If they had replaced the wolves with looters it might have been believable.    This movie is so far gone its no longer even about \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" or \\"fun entertainment\\". At serveral points I had to force myself to avoid shutting it off and snapping the DVD in half. The fact that people can give a movie like this 5 star reviews is a testament as to how far the viewing demands of the movie-going population have fallen. But then, what should I expect from an industry so messed up that it has someone like Anna Nicole Smith as an icon.
B0000636UN|5.0|Cd was in perfect condition and came fast. Thank you!!
B000N6U0E2|3.0|Listen, the message in this movie is a great one.  Work hard and you will succeed.  I am shocked at how many people seem to think the only thing this movie promotes is earning money.  What about the dedication Chris displayed to his son?  What about the earning self-respect by finding something important and meaningful to do with your life.  <br /> <br />The only thing that bugged me about the movie was that it could have been a more honest portrayal of the real man.  He wasn't the saint that we see Will Smith portraying him to be.  People are flawed (I know I am, because I haven't found a man who will commit to me yet) and Chris Gardner or whatever his name is is not an exception.  He was honest about it in his book, but the movie makes him out to be this absolutely perfect angel.  What a crock.  <br /> <br />But all that said, to live a comfortable life we all have to earn money.  It makes the world go 'round and we all need it.  Period, end of story.  Chris made a lot of it and that doesn't guarantee him a happy life but it sure makes the journey smoother.  Shame on those who prefer socialism (i.e. - communism) to the brand of capitalism we practice here in the great United States.

0385040253|5.0|I personally know very little about knots and can only tie a square knot or a granny knot.  This book was a birthday gift for my son who works on a tug boat.  He wanted this book more than anything else in the world for its thoroughness.  The book exceeded his expectation.  Sure, you can find many other books about knots that are cheaper.  But every once in a while it's nice to buy something that is the best at what it does - this book is the best book about knots available.
0060594888|5.0|Excellent condition and fast shipping.  Very good service !!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Hard to believe this is a blast from the past.  My son is learning some of the guitar solos so I've had a chance to listen to the disc quite a bit lately.  It really shook up the rock/metal scene, didn't it?  In some respects, this is not a five star album.  I mean, it's a classic and I love it, but as an album, it is not as consistent as a five star disc should be.  I can appreciate Atomic Punk for what it is, for example, but it disturbs the flow.  On Fire never did much for me, sorry to say.  But the good is really good.  The playing is incredible and Dave's singing style fits the music.  Michael Anthony was a highly under-rated background vocalist.  These guys were such a great band and the evidence is all right here.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies ever made.  Christian Bale put on one of the greastest performances by actor that i have ever seen.  He really deserved an oscar for the role.  As far as the picture quality of the movie for blu-ray, I would have to say it is outstanding.  One part in particular stands out, when Patrick Bateman Peels his facial mask off his face I think the picture jumps thru the screen.  Its as though your looking right at him.  Go Buy this movie and you won't be disapointed.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|I thought this could have been a GREAT movie. It had a really good story, and the effects in it were very good. But even with that said, I can't give any credit to the makers of this horrible movie.<br /><br />What could have been great turned out to be very underdeveloped and left me wanting a LOT more. The characters seemed thrown together. The storyline seemed to drag where it should have been full of action, and seemed to rush by when it should have been full of MUCH needed story. I can understand why people like this movie (there IS a very interesting story to it, the sets are very well done, the editing was good, too). I just didn't like it. It didn't make me feel anything, and when a movie doesn't captivate me and make me FEEL something, then I label it as a terrible movie.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me most about this movie? I sat through it, hoping that it would get better. Hoping that they would maybe develop the story more as the movie got closer to the end. I waited and waited. And waited. And do you know what happened? The movie just ended. Without warning. It was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a movie.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Everyone should have this dvd and watch with paren ts, grandkids!!!! It 2was an Easter gift to one grandchild and to my husband (80 years young)JUST GREAT
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This DVD sums up our past, present and future environments. It shows what has happened/changed in the world and the speed with which these changes occur. It is a great movie/presentation. Very well done and reflective of our needs and what we can do to help, in addition to enlisting governments in the healing process.<br /><br />It is passionate, warm, thoughtful, sober and educational, with humor sprinkled in.
1582701709|3.0|The book is a rehashing of the bible. It is a mirror image of biblical quotes. Granted the messages can be useful and helpful for those who have not had the opportunity to learn how beautiful the bible can be. However, for practicing Christians I urge them to go back to the original genuine article The Bible. It has everything you need including many of the same quotes and messages found in the Secret. There is only one God and He is the one who gives us blessings and mercy.
0316030058|4.0|At first I wasn't into it, but the more I read, the more I came to care about John and Savannah.  I really loved the way Savannah opened the door for John to understand his father and his disorder better, bringing them closer together.<br /><br />I liked Tim so well that, in spite of John losing Savannah, I was glad she married him because he was as good a man as John and--in some ways--maybe even better.  Talk about switching places!  This is a beautiful story that lives up to the old saying, \\"If you love somebody set them free.\\"  You know the rest.  This is one of Nicholas Sparks' most well-structured and touching novels yet.
0743289684|5.0|In broad terms this book describes Ayaan Hirsi Ali's transformation within the liberal culture of Holland from a Somalian refugee steeped in Islamic mysticism and clan tradition  into a secular westerner in less than ten years. In that same time frame it also describes how Holland has had to confront many of the attitudes it has to multiculturalism when faced with deadly violence from its Muslim immigrants, whenever their mysticism is challenged. The murder of Dutch film maker Theo van Gogh, being of particular note.    As well as this, the book concentrates on what it is for a woman to live under Islam, from the draconian attitudes of Saudi Arabia to the comparatively less draconian attitudes of Somalia. There are many virulent critics of Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Mostly Muslim men for whom Islam works very well indeed.    Ayaan Hirsi Ali has clearly demonstrated that Islam can be effectively countered if women choose to not accept life under its constraints and humiliations. And if western governments actively protected Muslim women's rights as individuals, Islam would be much less difficult to confront.
0596007124|3.0|I picked-up this book understanding that it used C# and Java for examples, yet under the impression that the concepts would easily generalize to the world of C++ (which C# and Java are descended from).  I find that this is not the case, as not only does class inheritance work dramatically differently in these languages as compared to C++, the explanations of the design patterns are written in such a manner as to be incompatible with any other language.  This is not useful as a general guide to design patterns, and due to the style of writing it strikes me as not very useful as a reference once aware of the fundamentals of the design patterns.  This is a sort of read-once and throw away sort of book.  Not my cup of tea.
0743496728|5.0|I have to admit that I never picked up a Picoult novel because the covers reminded me too much of chick lit. But I kept hearing great things about her writing. Intrigued by the premise of 19 Minutes, I picked up the book out of pure curiosity. Now, I'm mad at myself for not having discovered this amazing writer sooner. <br /> <br />19 Minutes affected me greatly. Being a teacher, school violence is a problem I have to deal with every day of the year. And 19 Minutes presents teenagers and their problems and issues in a very natural, very realistic way.  <br /> <br />When Peter, a young boy who has been bullied all of his life for no reason, walks into his high school with guns and bombs, a nightmare scenario no one thought possible happens. After his 19-minute rampage, Peter has killed 9 students, one teacher and has injured a series of others. The killings themselves are never graphically presented (a wise choice by the author). Instead, they are retolled through various narratives. We have Josie, a girl who used Peter's friend when they were children but who became one of the popular kids as he grew up (but as the story unfolds, we soon realise that she's hurting as well). We also meet Jodie's mother, a judge who might very well sit on the case. We have Peter's lawyer, who is trying to defend this boy as best he can. And we have Peter's mother, who can't help but blame herself for what happened even though she's always been a loving parent to Peter. <br /> <br />The book is a perfect example of what can happen if a child is put aside, forgotten, teased and hurt every day of his life. You can't help but sympathize with Peter. To him, what he did was an act of self-preservation and self-defense. And after you learn everything that has happened to Peter, you start seeing his point of view and undestanding why his idea of what happiness should be is all messed up. <br /> <br />The book presents both sides of the medals, while remaining impartial. Picoult's writing is tight and precise. She knows exactly what to say to hit a nerve. And she's not afraid of keeping things secret and slowly revealing them to her readers. This book is 450 pages long but has enough surprises and twists to keep you reading well past your bedtime.  <br /> <br />19 Minutes is the best book I've read in quite some time. I can't wait to read Picoult's other novels. After just one book, she's already made a new fan out of me!
B000002IST|4.0|5 years elapsed between the release of \\"Invisible Touch\\" in 1986 and \\"We Can't Dance\\" in 1991.  In between Phil Collins continued to milk his outlandishly successful solo career and Mike Rutherford had platinum success with Mike and The Mechanics.  \\"We Can't Dance\\" ended up being another huge commercial success for the band and covered the most variety of musical ground in their career.  The material varies greatly with pop, ballads, rockers, and progressive rock all being represented.  For me there are moments of greatness on this album, but also moments of extreme mediocrity.  Collins and company have their share of sappy ballads and lesser pop songs that are not necessarily bad, but not up to Genesis past high standards either.  Songs fitting into this category would include \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Never A Time\\", \\"Tell Me Why\\", \\"Hold On My Heart\\" and \\"Since I Lost You\\".  In the middle are several songs that although not classics, are good solid tunes including \\"No Son Of Mine\\", and \\"Way Of The World\\".  The really good stuff tends to be the ones that play to Genesis strengths as instrumentalists, and are generally the longer tracks on the album.  \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\" is a good one as is \\"Living Forever\\" with it's extended instrumental section.  \\"Driving The Last Spike\\" is an epic about railway workers in England.  I very rarely hear this song mentioned by Genesis fans as a classic, but I think it ranks up with the very best that the band has done.  Musically, lyrically, and vocally it is a top notch cut, and for me the highlight of the album.  The album closer \\"Fading Lights\\" is also very good and can be seen as a metaphor for the band's career at the time.  Instrumentally this is another highlight with Banks, Rutherford, and Collins all turning in fine performances.  Collins would leave the band after this album to concentrate on his solo career not returning until the reunion tour this year (2007).  Overall I really like about 2/3rds of this disc, and it is worth owning for \\"Driving The Last Spike\\", \\"Living Forever\\", and \\"Fading Lights\\" alone.

B000BB1MI2|4.0|I like the original and I like this remake. Tim Burton is a master at creating fantastic visuals, however he is not as good at telling a story. This is a much better movie than I thought it would be. Depp is great as usual and the DVD transfer is excellent!
B000ICL3KG|3.0|In the interests of disclosure, I note here that I am on the opposite side of Mr. Gore on almost every issue. With that aside, this movie is a good one. Gore is entertaining, even endearing in some points, and passionate throughout.  <br /> <br />The substance is a different matter: Many of Mr. Gore's conclusions and  implied conclusions are factually incorrect, and some of the data he shows actually subvert his belief that rising temperatures are the product of  rising CO2 levels, anthropogenic or not. His sophisticated presentation is actually extremely thin on hard, scientific facts.  <br /> <br />I spent $20 on this movie, in the interests of listening to the other side, being entertained, and maybe having my mind changed. Only the first two happened.
B00005JNQS|5.0|This is such a beatiful looking movie that I don't know if it matters that it is also a very good movie too. The animation is amazing and will have you checking out every little detail. The story is funny and moves along at a good pace. The DVD is an excellent transfer and this is a must have for family viewing.
B000002B1M|4.0|It was written was a pretty strong follow up to the 94 classic ILLMATIC.  As always Nas delivers with sharp lyrics and creativity, as heard on tracks like \\"I gave you power\\", where he raps from the perspective of a handgun.  The track, which was produced by DJ Premier, shows the chemistry between Nas & Premo.  My only gripes with the album are that certain tracks could've used better production, such as the Dre-produced \\"Nas is coming\\" in which I thought would've been better considering the track record of the legendary west coast producer.  Also, the song \\"Silent Murder\\", which was included on the cassette version is not included on the cd.    But still I would say that this is one of the best albums in the Nas catalog.  My personal favorite songs: \\"Street Dreams\\", \\"I gave you Power\\", \\"Black Girl Lost\\", \\"Live N*gga Rap\\", & \\"The Message\\".

0007205236|4.0|I liked this book because it was real and didn't hold back on the reality even though it was too harsh to believe.  It is hard to believe people actually lived this way. <br />The way this family dealt with what they were given goes to show people that you can get through anything if you just keep going.  People aren't always going to give you something when you ask for it.  Sometimes you just have to take what you need in order to survive.  Frankie wasn't afraid to assume the role of father when his father left.  He may have been scared, but he did what he had to do because otherwise his family wouldn't have survived.  Even though his eye infection was bad, he kept working because his family needed the money. <br />The times when he was forced to the brink of anger and hatred for certain people and he couldn't hold it in because he couldn't bare to see his family treated like that, he still went to confession after because he still wanted to be a good boy, he just had to make some tough decisions. <br />The fact that he never truly lost his dignity, but still wasn't so hard-headed as to be too stuck-up as to put his family in danger made him mature faster than any boy his age. <br />He didn't just not care about the bad things he did and he didn't make excuses that his life was hard and that was why he did those things, but he still felt guilt and that his life wasn't so bad to the point that he couldn't still try to be respectful of the world and people around him. <br />Despite the fact that life only seemed to hand them poverty and nothing went well for them in the end, they still tried to be something.  Frankie never gave up on his dream of going to America even though they were extremely poor.  They made their own good fortune and luck. <br />Sara, Sandia Prep
B00004TWZF|5.0|What can I say, the scenery and the music just makes this movie wonderful!
0307276902|4.0|An unoriginal subject, but nevertheless a unique narrative. Whether it's honest or not is regardless of it being a good read and a strong warning of drug addiction. Is it such a tragedy that one minute detail was altered in this non-fiction book? I think not. It's quite ironic that in our time in U.S. history when politicians lie over weapons and links to terror that never existed, which led us into a wrongful war, that we ignore these brutal truths. Yet we attack a man who has risen above, beat the odds, and did not hurt one human being by altering a detail of his courageous story. This book is horrifying, comical, and saddening at times. It demonstrates the darkness of addiction and the emptiness that consumes so many addicts. The negative criticisms of the book only further demonstrates the alienation that substance abusers must deal with.
1582701709|3.0|I am finding the Secret interesting, even though at times I really think it is just going around in a big circle of thinking positive thoughts.  If everyone could focus totally and be happy the way they say you can, we would have a perfect universe.  So in that sense, it find it a bit unrealistic!
B00000637V|4.0|...but I can't give it anymore than four stars in good conscience. Which I think is weird. I mean, Lou Reed was great at reporting from the darker side of life. Ever hear The Velvet Underground and Nico? If no, then it's a dark album, and a just classic, partially because of Reed's lyrics. Berlin is even DARKER, but also weaker. How did this happen? In part it's the producer's fault. Bob Erzin went overboard, dragging in horns, strings, keyboards, backup singers, piles of guitars and whatever else he could find. So instead of the \\"Phil Spector with as little instruments as possible\\" situation set up by VU & Nico, we get \\"Let's one-up Phil Spector in the overproduction department\\". In other words, this is completely pompous, ruining the effect a more stripped-down arrangement would have, and hurting a few of the otherwise great songs - Lady Day, where Lou gets a great vocal, is a fine example. So is The Bed, for that matter.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is Reed's 3rd best solo album, behind Transformer and The Blue Mask. Caroline Says I & II, How Do You Think It Feels, Oh Jim, The Kids and Men of Good Fortune are among Lou's best songs. And he touches on subjects such as suicide, drug abuse, S&M and death with his usual poetic grace. So it's hard - but not impossible - to fault Berlin.<br /><br />I'd also like to comment on Sad Song. Why is this so revered? I'm sorry, but it's a boring repeat-a-thon far from one of his best with a stupid title to boot. Doesn't do the job for me.
0743487486|4.0|Alfie Kohn has a lesson for all parents.<br /><br />Parenting should always come from a place of unconditional loving. Sounds like common sense? Right! However, time out, consequences as well as praise and reward come under scathing attack (backed by adequate research) as Kohn gives parents a well earned wake-up call. As an educator of Youth At Risk I see on a daily basis the negative results of punishment, consequences and reward. It is easy to label an adolescent as \\"uncontrollable\\" who has even failed to be \\"pulled into line\\" by a Behavioral school. However, treat this \\"uncontrollable\\" youth with respect and the modelling of community values not based on punishment and reward (pain and pleasure) and one generally sees a young person with limitless potential.<br /><br />Unfortunately the makeup of the \\"real world\\" means that it is also necessary for us to introduce our children to competitive ways otherwise they will be at a distinct disadvantage. They need to know the games people play - the way workplaces are structured etc -- however if they have been raised in a situation of unconditional love they will be motivated from within rather than from the pain or pleasure experienced.<br /><br />Excellent reading for parents and educators alike. As always the key is to learn from others, read widely and seek more than anecdotal evidence in order to develop your own parenting style.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This was all I expected and more! I had heard the title track but rest of the CD was just so dreamy.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|In the film Gibson adds the scene where Christ tells his Apostles \\"There is no greater love than to give one's life\\". Now that I'm an adult, if I could watch how much my own parents have endured with unselfish sacrifice, sleep deprivation, worry, and suffering to raise me in the best unselfish way they could to make me a better person, I guarantee you, I would be thankful. In fact any child would want to run to their loving parents with a tearful embrace asking their forgiveness in taking them for granted. To watch what another endured for me inspires me to be unselfish in raising my own children and in going out of the way for others without complaint. This is the essence of Christianity and this is the message The Passion delivers.
B00005JPGO|4.0|This movie is intense, cinematically beautiful, and exceptionally well acted. Strong supporting performances from Jennifer Connolly House of Sand and Fog, Requiem for a Dream) and Djimon Hounsou (Alias Season 3, Amistad) highlight a sublime performance from Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, The Basketball Diaries). DiCaprio has been churning out really good performances since his Oscar-nominated role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? It's a shame that he was thought of as just another pretty boy and that most people consider his mediocre performance in Titanic the highlight of his career. His performance in Blood Diamond should solidify his status as one of the greatest actors of his generations (and those muscles should make even more women swoon).  <br /> <br />The subject matter of the movie is captivating and heart wrenching. This is a story that needs to be told; that must be told. And Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai, Glory) does it justice in this film.  <br /> <br />After watching this film, I am justified in what I've been saying for years - I never want a diamond as the stone in my wedding ring or any other sort of diamond.
0596007124|5.0|Makes absolute sense ... easy and clear to understand! Must have!
B00000IWVS|5.0|Only one word: Excellent. <br />Though someone might have different feeling, I'm crazy on this 1965 recording.
B000002540|5.0|Nowadays we can look back and see that BOC have released at least 4 live albums, \\"On Your Feet........\\", the first in 1975, Some Enchanted Evening in 1978, Extra Terrestrial Live about 1980 en finaly in 2003 Long Days Night. Each of them proves the strenght of BOC as a live act, with a very good show that is equally impressive as say a show of KISS with different kind of effects. Being Dutch I had the honor of seeing them way back on several occasions in Holland and Germany. They were a somewhat mystic band with tremendous players, for instance Donald Roesers way of guitar playing is more fluent than Ace Frehley. \\"On Your Feet ....\\" is an epic document of their show and setlist midways the seventies, after having released the 3 black and white studioalbums, with nonalbumtracks such as \\"Bucks Boogie\\" (now is the studiorecordering as bonus available), the Blues Brothers song \\"I Aint Got You\\" and Steppenwolfs showstopper \\"Born to be Wild\\".  Every track is outstanding and gives you the idea of being part of the audience. With 5 musicians on stage, some of them playing different instruments (i.e. guitar and keyboards) and 4 of them singing lead this must be a hell of a job to record but the band succeed in it.  They had often incomprehensible lyrics which adds to their mysterous aura. Sometimes the music is utterly chaos, among them \\"ME 262\\" which culminates in \\"5 guitars\\" but beautiful recorded. A very strong album, simply one of the best live rockalbums ever made.
0792846443|5.0|This is one of my favouites movies ever....the movie was in perfect condition when i got it and i just finished reading the book so i thought that since the book was so good, i would watch the movie again...the movie is so good i actually bought it...its a cheap way to enjoy your friday night!
0307341542|5.0|I simply could not put this book down.  I started it late one night, and only stopped because it was 5 a.m., and I had to be somewhere at 9!  The author's ability at describing anything, everything, is almost uncanny for a rookie novelist.  I could perfectly see every character, smell every scent, feel every emotion she described.   <br />The story revolves around a serial killer, but it is the most forgettable part when you reach the end.  I don't have the greatest relationship with my family, but boy oh boy do they look sane now! <br />Definitely would recommend this book to anyone.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|After seeing this presentation on PBS, I just had to buy it for my continued enjoyment! I was pleased to find it reasonably priced on Amazon.<br /><br />As far as the content of the DVD, these Ladies are SO talented! Individually and collectively, their melody is impeccable! Each contributes exactly what is needed to have produced such quality sound.<br /><br />With the 23 cuts on the DVD, there is something for everyone.<br /><br />The extra feature that shows the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" work that went into this production enhances the enjoyment. Seems that there were over 200 people involved bringing this excellent concert together.<br /><br />I'm moving to Ireland!
B000002IFP|5.0|i listened to 'a new flame tonight,' as i finally found the copy i lost long ago.  it blew my mind, just as it did the first time i ever listened to it when it first came out.  i can't say enough about this cd.  it is beautifully done - mick's vocals are flawless - he can make his voice do absolutely anything!  it is so rich and soulful, powerful and gentle all at once.  there is honestly not one bad track on this cd.  i agree, SR's version of \\"if you don't know me by now,\\" is incredible, but the rest of the songs deserve just as much attention and praise.  really - i can't pick one song that outshines the rest, because they are all that good.  it is a perfect mix of jazz, r&b, blues, rock and a bit of pop thrown in, just to keep things interesting.  along with \\"picture book,\\" \\"a new flame\\" has got to be simply red's best.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|A more intelligent film than your average box office draw and more demanding of its audience.  <br />  <br />I was warned that the film was depressing, and its larger message is grim, but the way the film plunks us down in the daily life situations of two Third World and one First World, but very foreign, country, and the up-close-and-personal stay we make in each of those places, is rare in Hollywood movies.   <br /> <br />A previous reviewer dismisses the characters as \\"stupid people doing stupid things\\". What's engrossing about this film is that the characters who engage in such folly are so lovingly drawn and portrayed, reminding us that perfectly well-meaning folks can commit grave mistakes with broad repercussions due to their own lack of foresight and the irrational reactions of the larger world around them.   This is a movie that makes you think AND feel.  You can't help but cringe at the missteps that take the characters into disturbing places and experiences.   <br /> <br />Even more troubling is the fact that people do these sorts of things all the time.  People do pack themselves into air-conditioned busses to drive through the countryside (and rejuvenate their marriages) with little or no understanding of the circumstances of life for the people they pass along the way.  When they are forced to get down from the bus, it occurs to them to be scared of the locals, whom they might well imagine to be terrorists.   <br /> <br />As for the acting, while it was nice to see the box office draws of Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett, the lesser known actors were even more compelling.  Gael Garcia Bernal and Adriana Barraza are terrific; Rinko Kikuchi, Koji Yakusho and Yuko Murata also put in very strong performances; and the choice to cast local unknowns in Morocco was a refreshing addition to the use of Hollywood stars.  <br /> <br />When the character of Cheiko, the angry Japanese teenage deaf-mute who seeks love through sexual advances, stands naked on the balconyof the penthouse apartment she shares with her dad, and looks out over the urban landscape of postindustrial Tokyo, the human predicament is poignantly presented.  Other viewers read sexual innuendo into her father's embrace, but instead it seemed more of a father's belated and feeble attempt to comfort and protect the daughter who is fast growing beyond him into a woman. <br /> <br />
0743496728|5.0|WOW! Nineteen Minutes is without a doubt one of the most amazing books I have ever read. It traces the pre and post lives of those affected by a Columbine-like shooting, bringing hope and insight to a terrible tragedy. Picoult shines in her best novel yet, portraying a shocking-but-true situation and its story. Read this book, it is one you will never forget.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is one of my alltime faves.  I listen to this cd at night sometimes when i go to sleep, it is very calming.  For a dvd, i would suggest \\"live at the greek\\"  his voice is so clear and concise.  My favorite is 'remember when it rained'.
B000003TBP|5.0|My first Beck and the first time I heard him period. I bought it on a suggestion from relatives I can trust. Boy I am HAPPY!! Anyone just wants a taste of Beck this album has no set style but I am always tapping my foot or humming melodies. The lyrics of Zappa and musical capabilities of Mozart. Open your imagination and enjoy.
B0000TB050|5.0|This is such a great DVD, I purchased for my friends for their anniversary, being devoted U2 fans themselves.  I have also persuaded many of my other friends to purchase. <br /> <br />Following the band since I was 15, they have never let me down!  When my friend and I were in college, we spent many a friday evening watching our very well-worn VHS tape of Rattle and Hum.  IMO this is the best live DVD performance of U2.  I promise, U2 fans out there, you will not be disappointed!
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I've always been of fan of the Jane Eyre film starring William Hurt, so I didn't think I would like this as much. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this film was well done. I liked the way that the relationship that developes between Jane and Mr. Rochester was portrayed. Although there were parts of this story that I compared to the William Hurt version and preferred that one, i.e. I thought that Anna Paquin did a better job playing Jane as a child, I thought the older Jane and Mr Rochester's characters were very believable.
0671027344|5.0|Honestly, I promised myself I would not read this book.  For the simple reason that all my cynical teenage friends told me this book was \\"raw\\".  Meaning edgey, sarcastic, darker....you get the point.  So i assumed it was just another average teen fiction book.  And lately I have been looking for more than just that in my readings.  But after hearing so much about it for almost 2 years I decided to give it a try.  I guess the fact that I couldn't put the book down and have read it 3 times since I've purchased it would tell you that I had a very poor judgement of it.  Absolutely amazing. Enough said.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I knew nothing about Howard Hughes before watching the movie, and I think this movie did a good job of introducing me to this historical figure.  DiCaprio did an amazing job, his acting talents never cease to amaze me!  Wonderful movie!
B000002L7J|4.0|In today's day & age of artists releasing albums with the frequency of presidential elections, it seems almost inconceivable that a smash-hit debut could be followed one-year later by another equally-impressive album.  But that's exactly what The Smiths did in early 1985 with Meat Is Murder.  \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" and \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" are the two main standouts, however \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\", \\"Nowhere Fast\\", and \\"I Want The One I Can't Have\\" rival anything off the band's self-titled release.  Morrissey continues his heady and socially-conscious songwriting, while Johnny Marr takes his guitar-playing up a few notches - which is ultimately showcased on \\"How Soon...\\" (the rhythm guitar-track was conveniently sampled on Soho's 1990 hit \\"Hippie Chick\\", and one could make a case that Marr stole the main bent-chord from Jimmy Page's riff on Led Zeppelin's \\"The Rain Song\\").  Even Andy Rourke gets into the act with his funky bass line contribution on \\"Barbarism Begins At Home\\".  No weak spots on this gem, which will surely spark your interest from start to finish.  If not, you don't know what's good for you.
B000060OFT|5.0|I remember watching this movie in the theather when it first came out.  I was in high school at the time, and we had been studying Shakespeare.  This movie founded my love for this amazing playwrite.  The modern spin on the movie really makes the characters more relateable, and makes the Shakesperean language easier to understand.  It is fast-paced and dramatic, and watching it 11 years later, I still teared up.  DiCaprio and Danes were both remarkable, and I applaude the directing.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This \\"concert\\" was a magnificent return of the \\"original\\" members of the \\"Celtic Woman\\".  The magnificent blend of voices is overwhelmingly what makes the concert so gripping.  The purity of voice and clarity of tones are  rarely found and, in my opinion, unsurpassed.
0671027344|5.0|This book is written in the voice of a 15 year old teenage guy. The writing is very true-to-life. This book deals with many complex issues. The ending is extremely shocking. And you go back and flip through and realize there were little clues throughout the entire book that were leading up to such a shocking ending. I thought about this book for three hours after I read it. It's definitely a favorite of mine.
0930289234|5.0|Believe everything you hear about this book. It is without a doubt the best comic ever created.<br /><br />I overlooked this title for years because I wasn't interested in the bronze age artwork. Once I started reading it, that foolish prejudice quickly vanished. Watchmen changed the way comics were written, and rightfully so. There are few titles that can match the depth of this book, there are certainly none that I would place anywhere near it in terms of character examination and story development.<br /><br />I picked up Watchmen because I felt that I could not honestly call myself a comic book fan, even a super-hero fan, without reading the classics from writers like Moore and Miller. How right I was. Sure, read [[ASIN:0930289528 V for Vendetta]], [[ASIN:1401207529 Year One]] (my favorite Batman book) and [[ASIN:1563893428 Dark Knight Returns]], but Watchmen is really in a class of its own. Not just a great super-hero story, but a reflection of society, our culture, our government, and why we create super-heroes, past, present, and future.<br /><br />I will say that younger readers that did not experience any of the Cold War, or the political culture of the 70s or 80s might be somewhat disinterested. But a bit of historical knowledge and an appreciation for the history of comics and super-heroes is entirely sufficient.<br /><br />If you haven't read it, do so now. Your time will not have been ill-spent.
B000002KAT|5.0|If there is a single record album that has been most important in my life, this is it. If there has been an album that never grows stale, no matter how many times I play it, Astral Weeks is the one. If there are songs that have always been important to me over 39 years and counting, it is the songs on Astral Weeks.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can even tell you why. Partly, it's the jazz-rock fusion. Partly, it's Richard Davis's strong bass leads in many of the songs. Partly, it's Van's voice. In some of the songs, it's the lyrics (\\"I shall never grow so old again...\\"). In others, it's Van's phrasing that make otherwise mundane lyrics meaningful. The lyrics are elliptic, but never obscure.<br /><br />Certainly some of the pleasure comes from the sense of attending a jam session, and just listening in. The imperfections give it a live quality, and sense of intimacy. Others criticize the mistakes, but for me they are an important part of the emotion the album conveys. And maybe that's the heart of it: this is a cycle of songs about emotion. It never slips into cheapness or insincerity. It never condescends. It's never shallow. Whether it is the simple joyousness of \\"Sweet Thing,\\" the guilty anguish of \\"Cypress Avenue,\\" or the gender-bending of \\"Madame George,\\" the emotions are pure and genuine, and expressed uncommonly well.<br /><br />I have delighted in this album for years. It is in many ways a great artist's greatest work. My very highest recommendation.

B0002ZYE1Y|2.0|Being a fan of hard rock bands with female singers (Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, and yes, even the dreaded Evanescence), more people than I can count have told me to check out Nightwish, with \\"Once\\" being the album most recommended.  So I did ... and came away from the experience unimpressed.  Tarja Turunen does have an absolutely beautiful voice and the band rocks extremely hard, but the juxtaposition of the two sounds like Renee Fleming geting lost on the way to the Met and ending up in the studio with Iron Maiden.  It just doesn't mesh.  Tarja is now out of the band so perhaps the band will get (or has gotten) a singer that's not so technically perfect.  I can see where the music would have appeal, but it's just not for me.  Your mileage, of course, may vary.
B000002UAO|5.0|Relentlessly, like Secretariat in the Belmont Stakes, The Beatles kept pushing and pushing, constantly expanding the distance between themselves and the pretenders. On this landmark LP the lyrical and musical bars are elevated to new heights. The traditional boy-girl themes still dominate. However, the themes are more interesting and the manner of expression less direct. There is poetry here. Dylan and the Byrds are clearly having their influence. Instrumentally, too, new ground is broken - harmonium (The Word), piano (on four tracks), Fuzz base (Think for Yourself) and sitar (Norwegian Wood). George, although featured on several \\"minor\\" tracks on earlier releases, has two standout songs, the aforementioned Think and the Roger McGuinn influenced If I Needed Someone. The latter song together with the lovely In My Life are my favourites.<br /><br />Again the UK version of the LP trumps the US one. Here in North America we \\"lost\\" Drive my Car, Nowhere Man, What Goes On and If I Needed Someone in return for It's Only Love and I've Just seen a Face. It wasn't a fair exchange!<br /><br />After Rubber Soul the band, amazingly, continued to evolve. Revolver came next and it is a tremendous record. In many top 100 albums of all time lists it finishes in a higher position than Rubber Soul. Q (2006) has Revolver at #1 Soul at # 29, Rolling Stone readers #1 and #23, Virgin #1 and #34. For me it's a toss up. They are each amongst the greatest of all time, along with the \\"White Album\\", Pepper and Abbey Road.
B000I5X80G|5.0|Amzing this collection is. A must have along with Live at Massey Hall. Neil sounds like you remember especially if you saw him with Crazy Horse at the late Bill Graham's Fillmore East a favorite with the hippies in New Yorks Greenwich Village in the late sixties time of flower and beads! . A young Neil Young voice, rather than the mature version that comes with age and mileage. An incredible collection of well produced and well performed live tracks that can only bring you back to thw Woodstock era. Well worth the listen!
B000002OX7|5.0|Ask a Who fan to name his or her favourite song from the band and you will, of course, receive a variety of answers. What is remarkable is how often the nominated track is from this LP. Baba O'Riley, Bargain, Song is Over, Getting' in Tune, Goin' Mobile, Behind Blue Eyes and Fooled Again are all killer songs. The remaining two are pretty good too!<br /><br />Undeniably, this record makes my list of top twenty albums of all-time.  In no particular order are some of the others. There are fewer than twenty - the list is fluid - but the following have been included for years:<br /><br />Astral Weeks<br /><br />Abbey Road<br /><br />Are You Experienced<br /><br />Dark Side of the Moon<br /><br />Sticky Fingers<br /><br />The Band<br /><br />What's Going On<br /><br />Blue<br /><br />Pete Townsend wrote some memorable lyrics for this record.<br /><br />From Goin' Mobile:<br /><br />I don't care about pollution<br /><br />I'm an air-conditioned gypsy<br /><br />That's my solution<br /><br />Watch the police and the taxman miss me!<br /><br />I'm mobile!<br /><br />From Bargain:<br /><br />I'd pay any price just to win you<br /><br />Surrender my good life for bad<br /><br />To find you I'm gonna drown an unsung man.<br /><br />From Getting' in Tune<br /><br />I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well<br /><br />With the chords I'm playing<br /><br />I can't pretend there's any meaning<br /><br />Hidden in the things I'm saying.<br /><br />Although Next is a rock and roll album this is not just A rock and roll album. By 1971 The Who had been innovative and experimental for a few years. This record continued the trend. Townsend plays his familiar electric guitar with a flourish. He also plays some introspective acoustic. There is the violin solo on Baba O'Riley. The synthesizer is used to good effect on several songs. The overall sound is spectacular. Even now, 36 years later, this remarkable recording sounds as fresh as it did when it was released. It demands five stars.

0375714669|4.0|Ms. Satrapi was about eight years old when the Islamic revolutionaries took over the government in 1979 in her native country of Iran (she now lives in Paris). In these books (Persepolis and Persepolis 2 - Persepolis is an ancient name for Iran) she tells the story of the revolution as she saw it -- her Communist parents were highly involved in anti-Shah protests -- and what happened afterwards. When she was 14, the situation had become so dangerous in Tehran, her home, that her parents sent her to Vienna, thinking she'd be under the care of a close friend of the mother's who had emigrated earlier. The friend instead dumped Marjean, who spoke only Iranian/Arabic/Persian and French, at a Catholic boarding house, from which she was soon evicted. <br /> <br />Satrapi eventually took up with a group of friends who had similar breaks in their families and eventually entered the artistic/bohemian world, always with a strong interest in politics born by the events she witnessed in her childhood. <br /> <br />There is so much of interest in these two volumes -- which are in the new, fashionable, comic-book format -- I hardly know where to begin. They definitely provide information about Iran that never reached the US. For example, there is no mention of the US diplomats who were taken hostage -- as I recall, the news led us to believe the Iranian people were obsessed with them. Instead she tells a story of how \\"the new boss is the same as the old boss\\" - to the point that the revolutionaries' chief torturer is the same man who held that position under the Shah. Nor is there even a mention of the Ayatollah Khomeni. <br /> <br />At the same time we see the intense meaning that family has for the Iranian people. Overall, the books are revelations and quick reads, set in chapter/short-story format. As for the comic-book format, Satrapi is a terrific illustrator and some of her drawings convey her feelings more powerfully than any words could. <br />
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I would suggest this CD to anyone who enjoys good guitar and rockin' beats. Mark Knoffler and the band have such a broad array of sounds. Romeo and Juliet has to be my favorite. For any Dire Straits fan, I'd say this is a must have. I also purchased the DVD \\"One Night Only\\", and \\"Brothers In Arms\\" CD. Dire Straits is by far one of the finest all round rock bands of all time.

Instead she tells a story of how \\"the new boss is the same as the old boss\\" - to the point that the revolutionaries' chief torturer is the same man who held that position under the Shah.  Nor is there even a mention of the Ayatollah Khomeni. <br />  <br />At the same time we see the intense meaning that family has for the Iranian people.  Overall, the books are revelations and quick reads, set in chapter/short-story format.  As for the comic-book format, Satrapi is a terrific illustrator and some of her drawings convey her feelings more powerfully than any words could. <br />

0060589469|2.0|I don't really care for chatty writers, and Pirsig likes to palaver on like it's nobody's business. Just get to the point and back it up with facts. The first time I read Zen was when I was teaching college at the time it was published. There was a lot of buzz going around about the book. Some profs were assigning Zen to their students, while almost everyone was praising it as the book of the century. So I had to read it. It didn't live up to the hype. There's nothing really deep or novel here unless you're a fan of syncretism, in this case the meshing of Eastern thought with Western thought. It's my view that both are mutually exclusive, and that any attempt to combine them dilutes both of them. But I'm biased. I'll take the Greeks, Augustine, Aquinas and the rest of the Western tradition any day.

If I had known of the hype surrounding it, I probably would have shied away from it, but I just happened upon it in the bookstore on a sale rack and tossed it in my basket. A very enjoyable read.
1416524800|3.0|After having read Angels and Demons, and DaVinci Code, I expected this earlier book to be good, but not as polished as Brown's earlier stuff. I was right, actually disappointed. Brown's writing style is very readable, but he's never going to win an award for great writing. The plot to this book is predictable. It's a page turner, but not because you want to find out what's going to happen next (that's pretty easy) but because you hope something interesting happens next. Fortunately its one of those books you can fly through. I guess it entertaining but by page 500 I was reading it just to finish it. The characters are so thin in this book you start making up personalities for them based solely on their names. I mean Corky is going to be a quirky, science loving nerd who supplies the odd comical bit. There are dozens of better thrillers out there. The only reason this one gets 3 stars is because I finished it.

There is no concept such as crime or morality anymore, just what comes naturally. <br /> <br />Anything goes, and we need look no further than our local loony liberals whenever we need guidance in regard to meaninglessness, our purposes or even our mortality. <br /> <br />At the same time, of course, the victims of crime are suffering the most unendurable hell.

B000N3SS80|1.0|There's no use beating about the bush: With crooner husband Marc Anthony at her side, Jennifer Lopez has at last made her big splash into Spanish-language pop. A splash of soulless stagnation, that is. \\"Como Ama Una Mujer (How a Woman Loves)\\" makes a better coaster for dinner parties than a CD for the stereo. Bought digitally, it would be truly worthless.<br /><br />Granted, everyone knows that Jennifer Lopez is no Julie Andrews when she opens her mouth, but she is no Jimmy Durante either. And what was the secret to his success as a singer? Not vocal agility, but a strong personality, the ability to inflect emotional depth and sincerity and an indefinable passion that makes a performer unique. Lopez lacks these attributes here, so the output has no worth.<br /><br />Though her debut album \\"On the 6\\" is a pleasant if already dated look back at late 90's English-language Latin pop, her subsequent records have been guilty pleasures at their best and pop schlock at their worst, with the latter predominating. In fact, no trace of genuine Latin instrumentation has been heard since that first album, doubtlessly due to Ricky Martin being the flavor of the month at the time of its release. Accordingly, the transition from the faux-urban hip-pop and slinky Middle-Eastern tinged radio drivel that marked 2005's \\"Rebirth\\" is indeed an eyebrow-raiser.<br /><br />That she is not fluent in Spanish certainly shows in her vocal delivery, but the tepid songs don't help. Lead single \\"Que Hiciste (What Did You Do?)\\" sounds promising when it bursts into a rhythmic riot of Spanish guitars and winning instrumentation but ultimately sinks like a pound of lead. Going off in too many directions at once, it becomes embarrassingly scattered and awkward.<br /><br />A few songs in, it becomes evident that the disc is too heavy on the ballads; nearly every song sounds like a banal Telenovela theme, and most drag on for so long they can only be described as cumbersome. The six-minute title track drifts away like cotton candy, and the more urgent ballads sound more self-important than sincere, reaching their culminations with nary an impressive moment. \\"Tu (You)\\" in particular is significant since Lopez attempts to hold notes that require sufficient vocal flair. The result is the sound of a train as it fast approaches a station, screeching against the rails.<br /><br />The disc concludes with \\"Adios (Goodbye),\\" a supposed live recording with a super-imposed crowd and a giggling Lopez. This is ironic from a singer who has never toured and has cracked her voice during numerous televised performances. This selection would be a fine listen in the hands of a more capable singer.<br /><br />Love her or hate her, Jennifer Lopez has star quality that shines through on even her most mediocre projects, but that lucky streak has hit a grinding halt with \\"Como Ama Una Mujer.\\" A much better purchase would be \\"Amor Prohibido (Forbidden Love),\\" the final full-length album from Selena, whom Lopez was privileged to portray in her eponymous 1997 biopic. For something more current, \\"Fijacion Oral Vol. 1\\" by Shakira, who deserves commendation for being her own writer, still sports dizzying musical heights two years after its release. The difference is not just in the material, but in the sincerity.the more urgent ballads sound more self-important than sincere, reaching their culminations with nary an impressive moment. \\"Tu (You)\\" in particular is significant since Lopez attempts to hold notes that require sufficient vocal flair.

0553278223|5.0|At the very worst, The Martian Chronicles is a fantastic piece of Fantasy/Literature. At it's best, it is a masterpiece that simply succeeds at everything. While it may be a collection of short stories, Ray Bradbury molds all of them together beautifully into one coherent whole. This book is very dark but has a surprisingly optimistic and happy ending. The Martian Chronicles should be required reading in all high schools. <br /> <br />The Martian Chronicles is my third favorite Bradbury book after Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes, though in some parts it was more enjoyable than both books. <br /> <br />FIVE stars. Keep writing masterpieces, Ray.
B000M06K5C|2.0|I was very disappointed with this latest album. There were only one or two songs I could find any redeeming qualities in.  Stick with \\"Silent Alarm.\\"
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I would actually give Plans 4.5 stars, but I am rating it a 5 to help pull the overall rating to a 4.5.    This was my introduction to Death Cab For Cutie by a friend. She made me listen to \\"Soul Meets Body\\", and I was in love with that song. I purchased the album, and to my surprise, there were a few tracks I liked more than \\"Soul Meets Body\\". There are a couple of tracks that don't work well (\\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\", for instance), but when it does work well, it's a mellow and beautiful listen.    Standout tracks: \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\", \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\", \\"Crooked Teeth\\", \\"Soul Meets Body\\", \\"Summer Skin\\", \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room\\".

0920668372|5.0|My mother was a pre-school teacher and she bought me a copy to read to my children when they were young.  I would sit them on my lap and rock them back and forth on the parts of the book where the mom is doing this.  Each time I got to the part where the son is rocking his mom, I would choke up a bit and being the softy that I am, the kids would smile and tell me it was ok and they would finish it.  My children are now grown with kids of their own and each of them have the book and read it to their children.  When I get cards they always put on there, \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always.\\"  To comment on two of the negative reviews here that I read, there are many children's book that if you take them out of their context and make more out of it than what is there it can seem a bit odd but they are old time favorites and always will be.
B000000JO3|5.0|Years after its release, these tracks still have all their immediacy and power.  <br /> <br />This is quintessential DC hardcore, and of course the first \\"straight-edge\\" band. Whether or not you agree with their philosophy, the music that emerged from it is tight, smart, sometimes funny, and frequently ironic. There are times when the tunes seem almost electrically charged - and like an electric shock, they're short and to the point. Whether with \\"In My Eyes\\" (one of the hardcore classics) or the searing \\"I'm Seeing Red,\\" these guys aren't mouthing words.  <br /> <br />This is DC hardcore at its purest. It's one of those essential records that time can't seem to touch.

B000028U0Y|5.0|Well, of course this is a classic - the first of two \\"prison\\" live LPs that would help solidify Johnny Cash's \\"bad boy\\" image in contemporary culture. As such, this record is more of an event, or even a story; Cash's intros connect to the crowd in a special way because everyone knows their unique situation, and can to a certain extent identify. It's a brilliiant concept for one of the most thrilling live recordings ever. <br /> <br />Missing, oddly, is the classic \\"A Boy Named Sue,\\" which appeared as a single. A usual with Johnny Cash, it takes several records to finally end up with the ones you like.

B00005AAFS|5.0|My first exposure to Rammstein was through the Lost Highway soundtrack.  I wrote them off as a two-dimensional metal band that couldn't go beyond monotonous chords and an even more monotone voice.  It was only upon paying attention to the lyrics (I speak German) that I gave them a second chance - thank goodness! <br />Rammstein is an underrated, overcriticized band in Germany.  Fact is they love to provoke, not only through lyrics, but also in sound and appearance.  I find this is a role they grew into, and that the albums 'Herzeleid' and 'Sehnsucht' were just a precursor to their later accomplishments.  'Mutter' perfectly captures a maturer tone and style  without sacrificing what is uniquely Rammstein - strong, addictive chords coupled with a strong, at times spooky voice.  Links 2, 3, 4 is an example of their defiance to being pigeonholed as neo-nazis, while Adios and Nebel display 'calmer', more lyrical talents.  Yes, Till can actually sing well and not just chant! <br />I can only agree with the other reviewers that this is the best Rammstein album.  It does not disappoint the more hardcore fans, while it opens the door to those who want more than just mosh-pit rock. And you don't need to speak German to get a lot out of it!
6305428050|4.0|When seventeen-year-old Chris Parker's boyfriend cancels their big date, she reluctantly agrees to baby-sit for Sara and Brad Anderson. Chris thinks she is too old to baby-sit but Brad doesn't mind - he has a huge crush on Chris. When Chris gets to the Anderson's, she has just settled in for what she thinks will be a very boring evening when she gets a phone call from her friend Brenda who is stuck at a bus station in \\"The City\\". Chris agrees to pick up Brenda and has to take Sara, Brad, and Brad's friend Daryl, with her for what she hopes will be a quick trip. Instead, a flat tire leads to all kinds of adventures including a crazed tow truck driver; a stolen car ring; a gang fight; a visit to a Blues Bar; a frat party; a meeting with \\"Thor\\" (Sara's hero); and a heart stopping chase down the side of an office building. Suddenly, what looked to be one of the most boring nights of Chris's life turns out to be one of the most exciting.<br /><br />\\"Adventures in Baby Sitting\\" is a good fun movie, the kind you can watch without thinking too much about it - the kind of movie that keeps you smiling the whole time you are watching it. Nothing in it is to be taken seriously (for one thing Brad is way too old to need a babysitter) and while there are bad guys, they are never too scary and the kids easily outsmart them. The film is non-stop action and there are a lot of fun scenes in the movie. The scene in the Blues Bar is an instant classic. This is a good family movie, but parents should be aware that there is some colorful swearing (but in a very funny scene). The acting is good. Elisabeth Shue shines as Chris; Keith Coogan is good as the love struck Brad; Maia Brewton is wonderful as Sara; and Anthony Rapp is sufficiently annoying as Darryl. Of the supporting cast, Calvin Levels is a standout as Joe Gipp, the not so bad car thief.<br /><br />\\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" is a great comedy/action film.

B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica-...And Justice For All *****<br /><br />Forget the production. Forget that you can not hear the bass. Forget that the person playing the bass to which you cannot hear is not Cliff Burton. Just listen to the music and soak it in and realize that dispite all of those things ...And Justice For All is one of the all time best metal albums ever. Many people say that Master Of Puppets was the last Metallica album or the last great Metallica album, well that just is not true. This and even a few of the rock albums the band made were really well.  James Hetfield still wrote killer songs and played the best rhythm guitar in metal here. Lars Ulrich was still making the songs heavier then need be. Kirk Hamett at this time was still playing guitar solos, and good ones at that. ...And Justice For All is still a really great metal album.<br /><br />The guitar playing on this album is some of the best Metallica ever played, surely some of the best of thrash and metal and of guitar playing in general, and 'Blackened' is a perfect example of that. The song is the perfect track to start the album. It is a radio staple even to this day. A true Metallica classic. The title track '...And Justice For All' features some of the bands best set of lyrics of their entire career. Hametts guitar playing on this track is out of this world. The song contains at least ten different riffs through out. The tempo changes frequently so that the ten minute time length does not get boring at all. This is truly one of the very best songs in metal history, the thing that blows me is that they were able to play the song live and perfectly at one time. The first time that I heard 'Eye Pf The Beholder' I was not that thirilled. Lets just say I was not that big of a fan of the song. Now that I have got more into guitar playing and listened to the song while expanding my musical horizons so to speak the song has grown on me. Production on the song while still rather poor sounds really good here with the vocals. 'One.' Yes the classic 'One' the song that either won you over or made you turn your back on Metallica all together. Because it was the first song that Metallica released a video for they lost a lot of their fan base because they all said Metallica say it. Metallica has no loyal fans because to hear them tell it the band has sold out on say ten different occasions. Well the point is that the song is one of the bands all time best and it conatins Kirk's best guitar solo ever, as well as one of the best of all time. It is killer song about a soilder who loses it all, literally. Lars' drumming is that of legend during the climax of 'One. 'The Shortest Straw' is one of the few lesser known tracks on the album that does not recieve much radio play if any. Not because it is a bad song or anything like that just on this album it does not really do much to stand out. This may also be because of the two songs in which it is between. 'Harvester Of Sorrow' is another radio classic, one of the bands all time best, and maybe the best song on the album. Great chorus, and chugging guitar sure to get your attention. When you listen to the album the entire way through and hear this right after 'The Shortest Straw' it really sounds good. Truly a phenomonal song. 'The Frayed Ends Of Sanity' is a killer song with an outragous intro. The \\"yo-ho\\" from the monkeys in The Wizard Of Oz is the intro to what becomes and absolutly brutal song thanks to Hetfields guitar and Ulrichs drumming. 'To Live Is To Die' has many tempo and riff changes during the song. It starts out slow but builds. Not many lyrics to this song so it is mainly an instrumental so with ten minute length you would think it gets boring but it is so good from start to finish that you do not even realize the length of the song. ...And Justice For All closes with yet another Metallica classic and radio staple, 'Dyers Eve.' One of the all time great songs in Metallicas cannon is Dyers Eve. \\"Dear Mother, Dear Father\\"instantly recognizable.  A song about child abuse, and among the thousands about the subject I would say it is only second to Aerosmith's 'Janies Got A Gun.' A killer song that ends and already amazing album perfectly.<br /><br />...And Justice For All may have very raw production compared to their other albums but it is still one of if not the bands greatest album. It sure is their greatest acheivement. Think about it they lost who may have been teh greatest bass player in metal and all of rock music for that matter and managed to come back with a killer album with almost no bass involved, not any that is auidable anyways. This is an album that no Metallica fan can own and have the nerve to call themselves a true Metallica fan. This is a trash, and metal landmark that is a must own for all collections.ar Father\\" instantly recognizable.

B000N3AXQU|5.0|This is a great end to one of the best franchises of my life time.  I saw the movie at a prescreen and loved it.  I left the theater thinking \\"Rocky Should Have WON!!!!!\\".  I had the same feeling I had after not watching number one for awhile and going back and seeing it. After watching the movie again on bluray and doing something ive never done before (watched all the extras)I decided I think the ending is just fine.  There is another ending of the movie that is in the extras that while it felt good it didnt leave the same depth and contentment that the movie version had.  I must say this is one that should have been made instead of 5.  (even though I liked 5)
B0000035E7|5.0|Nirvana-Bleach *****<br /><br />Nirvana's realt debut, yes there was a band before the over hyped Nevermind. Bleach is a phenomonal album, it's Nirvana at their most honest and pure, not to mention raw. This is their most true to punk album, really the heart and soul of what would become grunge. This along with the earliest albums by Soundgarden and Alice In Chains debut Facelift and the Mudhoney albums were the real start of grunge as a respectable genre.<br /><br />Here on Bleach it is clearly not the classic lineup that made the band famous. Dave Growl is not on drums, Chad Channing is, and Kurt Cobain is not the only guitar player. No at the time the band also had Jason Everman to play lead which is why the guitar playing on this album is better then the rest of the other Nirvana albums because Kurt does not play lead here, just ryhthm like is is good at. While this album much like the lineup are not that famous it is truly a classic and gave us some of the most memorable songs of the bands short lived career.<br /><br />'Blew' 'About A Girl' 'Negative Creep' Mr. Moustache' and 'Downer' are all NIrvana classics. 'Negative Creep' actually inspired Slash to form Velvet Revolver. 'About A Girl' has really become a radio staple since Cobains death, and has really just become an all around rock n' roll classic. lesser famous songs like 'Paper Cut' 'Big Cheese' and 'Love Buzz' are also great songs, actually some of the best on the album.<br /><br />Kurts vocals are very raw here and much more personal. On 'School' you can here he is really singing about something he is passioned about. Because the production on the album is horrible compared to Nevermind and In Utero the band sounds more authentic and personal. This album is by far the best Nirvana album. All of the bands albums, this, Nevermind, In Utero, and even the rarities Incesticide all do not contain one bad song, but this album has the best songs. This was when Cobain wasnt whigging out about the pressures of fame or what ever his personal crisis, and he wasnt totally currupt on drugs so his mind was under control of what ever he was on at a given time. This is the most true to blue album of what Nirvana really was, even Cobain said they completly changed and sold out after this album. So if you want a real Nirvana album, and a real poetic experince from Cobain, then this is the way to go.he pressures of fame or what ever his personal crisis, and he wasnt totally currupt on drugs so his mind was under control of what ever he was on at a given time.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|After reading many of the reviews on this site I can't help but think that there are some people out there who are in denial about what is really happening with our world.  It seems that when it comes to Art that provokes thought, there is always a vocal minority that would have it labelled as \\"rubbish\\".<br /><br />Not that this movie represents what is happening on Earth and in the World, but it does beg the question: Who are the people of the World and who are the people of the Earth? Sounds redundant, but there really is a difference between people of the World and people of the Earth. Are they mutually exclusive of each other? They seem to be at odds. Can they co-exist? This is not only a great film, but a very important film. This is the kind of film that should be studied in Film Schools. It is an attempt at highlighting current events, as opposed to covering them up with technological gatchetry and tired Sci-Fi set designs.<br /><br />The film works on many levels. It is allegorical, spiritual, political, melodramatic, comedic, and ironic. It's not really Sci-Fi. It's disguised as such. Some of the best Science Fiction is really hyper-Realism. Children of Men can be typified as Hyper-Realist, or multi-realist, or poly-realist. Examples of this genre can be seen in movies such as Crash and Babel.<br /><br />Children of Men is not Blade Runner. It is part Blade Runner, part Brave New World, part War movie, but mostly it is a sad and beautiful fable with a desperate message of Hope. But it is a Hope that is not tied to any of our so-called traditions, or systems. It is a free-floating Hope, much like the boat at the end with Tomorrow written on it. The message seems to be that we must all begin to recover our sense of connectedness with each other as physical beings and not as members of some exclusive club that will somehow outlive everyone else.<br /><br />This movie has a dystopian facade, and has been done over and over again, but underneath its symbolism one can barely see the outline of a different take on Utopia.e outline of a different take on Utopia.
B000002KD9|5.0|Neil Young-After The Gold Rush *****<br /><br />Neil Young released his seceond classic solo album in 1970. This time he elected to go it without the help of the grea Crazy Horse. Though he did use every member of the band at one point or another during the recording of After The Goldrush this was largley a solo album. A much softer and lighter album then it's predicesor Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, and actually accesable compared to the debut selftitled album. After The Goldrush is a much more personal album with more hearfelt lyrics and a far less dry recording then that of his previous albums.<br /><br />By this time Neil Young had already made a large name for himself working with the legendary Buffalow Springfield, the success of Everbody Knows This Is Nowhere, and he was beginning to work with Crosby, Stills, and Nash, so it was only logical that this album be a massive success.<br /><br />Songs like 'Tell Me Why' and the hit 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart' and 'I Believe In You' are very personal songs that have to be heard to appreciate and when heard one can since and feel the longing in Youngs voice for love. The cover of the country classic 'Oh, Lonesome Me' really sums up the entire feel of this album and Neil mood at the time, he was in a very low place and was longing for companionship of some kind. While tracks like the short 'Till The Morning Comes' and the equally as short 'Cripple Creek Ferry' seem up beat and peppy they are the shortest moments on the album and by the far the only half way forgetable ones on this classic. 'Southern Man' is a classic and it was destend to become so the moment it was recorded. Establishing Neil Young as a certified first rate guitar slinger, and the Godfather of grunge all at the same time. 'Southern Man' is one of if not the single most contraversial songs Young ever recorded causing a rivalry between him and the southern rock band from Alabama, Lynyrd Skynyrd. The title track on the album 'After The Gold Rush' is another Young classic and one of his all time best songs. It is a song about the renissance, the 1970's, and the future and how the world is changing and not changing and what we could be doing to fix things but are not doing. It is a calssic song that is for sure. 'When You Dance You Can Really Love' is one song that has always be given a bad rap and for what I do not understand the song is wonderful and one that I personally get lost in everytime I hear it. 'Birds' is without a doubt one of the most beautiful songs Neil Young or anyone has ever written and it is heart wrenching to listen to. You relaly must hear to understand what I mean. 'Dont Let It Bring You Down' is possibly the best song Young ever recorded. The melody line and the vocal layering is wonderful. The lyrics are spectacular, quite simply amazing. Do sit and write in a little review how amazing 'Dont Let It Bring You Down' is, is just frankly impossible. Just listen is all that can be said.<br /><br />After The Gold Rush has gone down in history and one of the all time greatest rock n' roll albums ever. Many best of, critics, and music fans alike. After The Gold Rush is an album all Neil Young fans and all rock n' roll fans around the world should own. It's an album of songwriting, and much more tendor then most of the other albums in Youngs cannon, Highly recomended.ld Rush' is another Young classic and one of his all time best songs.

'Birds' is without a doubt one of the most beautiful songs Neil Young or anyone has ever written and it is heart wrenching to listen to. You relaly must hear to understand what I mean. 'Dont Let It Bring You Down' is possibly the best song Young ever recorded. The melody line and the vocal layering is wonderful. The lyrics are spectacular, quite simply amazing. Do sit and write in a little review how amazing 'Dont Let It Bring You Down' is, is just frankly impossible. Just listen is all that can be said. <br /> <br />After The Gold Rush has gone down in history and one of the all time greatest rock n' roll albums ever. Many best of, critics, and music fans alike. After The Gold Rush is an album all Neil Young fans and all rock n' roll fans around the world should own. It's an album of songwriting, and much more tendor then most of the other albums in Youngs cannon, Highly recomended.

B000005IU2|4.0|Iggy And The Stooges-Fun House ****<br /><br />Fun House was the second Stooges album. Released in 1970 Fun House along with The Stooges two other albums Raw Power and the self titled The Stooges became what is now known as proto-punk. The stooges were the precursor to punk. But what is interesting about that is the band had the punk attitude but their music was sometimes lengthy and often contained horns, and jazzy time signatures, all of which are not in the punk genre usually. But that in itself is what makes it punk because The Stooges did what they wanted weather it was acceptable or not.<br /><br />Iggy Pop, Dave Alexander, Steven Mackay, Sott and Ron Asheton are at the top of their game here. While this was Steven Mackays last album with the band he sure went out with a bang. Mackay wasnt an official member of the band really but he was always listed on the album up until Raw Power. But anyways the band was nothing less then amazing here.<br /><br />On the bands debut, The Stooges, they had a song called '1969' which went on to become a classic, well here they have '1970' which while not as good as 69, is an excellent song and what do you know it also went on to become a classic. 'Down On The Street' which opens the album and does so brilliantly. It's a hard rocker with lots of energy and great guitar. 'Loose' is a lot like 'penatrate' from Raw Power. The titled refects the feel of the sound of the album. The song is about sex obviously. 'T.V Eye' is one of the better songs on the album, and Iggy gives a fantastic performance. 'Dirt' drags on a little long but is still a great song. 'Fun House,' the title track is one of the best songs on the album. It is rich in Saxophone. This is a longer song as well, almost eight minutes in length. But it never gets boring. The album ends with 'L.A. Blues' is well just noise. The album could have been better with out it. Iggy just growls and the band just plays random notes and scales as if it is a jazz improvision. Completly aweful way to end a otherwise great album.<br /><br />Fun House has gone down in history as one of the all time greatest albums in punk, rock n' roll, and music in general. Fun House is an album that no collection should be without, and an album that no collection is complete without. If your a fan of Iggys solo work then you will love this. If you are a fan of punk you will really love this because you can see where they all drew influence from. Truly a great record that I would recomend to all who are interested.vision.

B00000FCBC|5.0|Metallica-Garage Inc. *****<br /><br />So Metallica decided to record an album of covers to pay homage to some of thier idols, and once again their fans had the nerve to say they sold out....again. This is what the tenth time they sold out supposedly. Everyone wants to make an album of covers becuase you start out playing music to learn to play songs you love, and somebody made you want to play those songs. Metallicas roots being in classic hard rock, early metal, punk, and the new wave of British heavy metal you would think thats what they would cover, and they do but also throw other genres in for good measure like R&B, and Southern Rock. Discharge, Diamond Head, Black Sabbath, Bob Seger, The Misfits, The Bad Seeds, Mercyful Fate, Blue Oyster Cult, Thin Lizzy, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Holocaust, Killing Joke, Budgie, Blitzkrieg, Queen, Anti-nowhere League, Sweet Savage, and Motorhead are all covered on this album. I just wish they would have covered an Aerosmith song since all the members of Metallica say they are one of their greatest influences.<br /><br />Disc one contains new recordings the band had made for the album in 1998. Disc two contains their Garage Days Re-revisited from 1987. It also contains Garage Days revisited from 1984. B-sides from 1988-1991. And finally the Motorheadache from 1995.<br /><br />Songs like 'Its Electric' form Diamond Head and 'Die, Die My Darling' from Misfits are done so good at times I do think they may be better then the original. The bands cover of Thin Lizzy's 'Whiskey In The Jar' completly owns the original. Easily the best version of the song, and actually the band scored a minor hit with the song as well. The odd cover of 'Tuesdays Gone' by Lynyrd Skynyrd while out of place is none the less a great cover that the band pulls of flawlessly. With John Popper of Blues Travaler on harmonica the song is a sure win. Bob Seger And The Silver Bullet Bands 'Turn The Page' is done wonderfuly. The use of guitar instead of saxophone was a nice touch and original, but the bands video adaptation of it being about a stripper is aweful, the song is about a struggling musician trying to make it in the early 1970s. 'Breadfan' totally owns the original and is NOW a metallica classic. The band won a grammy for their cover of Queens 'Stone Cold Crazy.' They did it better then Queen did with the exception of the vocals for obvious reasons. All the Motorhead covers are done well. It is clear that they all use to play a lot of Motorhead. 'Last Caress/Green Hell' are both killer Misfits songs originaly but Metallica seem to even manage to make them better.<br /><br />None of the authanticity is taken away from the songs when the band covers them. They do them all justice and I am sure that all the originators of the songs would be proud to have a band of Metallicas stature cover their material. This was the last great thing we heard from Metallica before they started to get full of themselves. I will never say Metallica sold out because they didnt. But they are very full of their own opnions and as long as they are making music they care about I will continue to support them beucase I am at heart a true Metallica fan.ne was a nice touch and original, but the bands video adaptation of it being about a stripper is aweful, the song is about a struggling musician trying to make it in the early 1970s.

1582701709|1.0|I couldn't finish this book.  I only bought it because everyone was talking about it being so wonderful.  It was a waste of money.  Of course good things are going to happen to you sometimes in your life, unless you are just the unluckiest person in the world.  All this book was about is positive thinking.  I've been thinking positively that I was going to win the Lotto, but I haven't yet.  This book is just a load a bologna.  Maybe I can sell it on Ebay for a $1.
B0000019PA|5.0|I just wanted to nitpick a little... though the reviews for ITAOTS are mostly gushing (as they should be), it surprises me how often people mention that Jeff Mangum \\"doesn't have a good voice,\\" or somesuch. True, he doesn't have a voice I'd cast an opera around, but his phrasing, warbling (for lack of a better term), and intensity are superb, he's fun as hell to sing along to, and he has the lung capacity of a sperm whale (threw in that sperm reference just for you, Jeff). I just wanted to bring that up and make the point that the vocals are one of the album's greatest strengths, not its only weakness. As the featured review says, they become endearing after awhile.

And Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit sets a modern standard for zany.  It's just a shame that Disney went cheap on us so we can't have more Roger Rabbit tales (NYUK, NYUK, pun intended).  Get the dip for the fuddy-duddies that let this classic character slip through their hands.  More Roger Rabbit!

B000E5KUK6|4.0|Well I enjoyed this film, it was a fun night out, when I firsts aw it theatrically and to this day I still pop it in for good entertainment. Is it the old Godzilla, no not by far. I love old Godzilla I really do, but I'm no crazed fanatic. I have all of the movies featuring Godzilla, and they are all fun, some not so fun like SOn of Godzilla-really bad film. BUt they all have they're charm.  I know that Godzilla fans hate the remake or revision. But lets be realistic, if your going to remake Godzilla go all out and make it different. The special effects were great, still are as well as they hold up even today. While I consider Gojira a full blown classic, I'm glad they went somewhere different with it here in the remake. There are some good laughs and cool action scenes. The overall story is weak but not bad, and the new look for Godzilla and lets be realistic fits, while I wanted a full blown fire breathing monster, at least we got a giant monster. I wish this would get a sequel. But I know most people will hate me for giving this a good review but yknow so what.  A man in a rubber suit doesn't cut it anymore people, I'm sorry. Thats probably why I don't like any of the modern films that came after this remake. They are just sad movies.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|By any measure this is one of the finest dystopian works of art ever made.  It easily takes its place alongside other visions of the future such as novels such as 1984, FAHRENHEIT 451, and BRAVE NEW WORLD and films such as BLADE RUNNER and BRAZIL.  But unlike most of these other dystopian masterpieces, CHILDREN OF MEN ends on a hopeful, mildly optimistic note.<br /><br />The movie, set approximately 20 years in the future, begins shockingly with an announcement on television news that the world's youngest person has died at age 18.  A few seconds later the fast food place on whose TV we have been watching the news is destroyed by a terrorist bomb.  The two shocking events set the tone for the rest of the film.  We get a picture of a society in rapid decline, a dying world in which one widely advertised project is Quietus, a reference to the peace that Hamlet might receive if the fear of an afterlife did not keep him from suicide.  In this instance it is indeed a medication for ending one's life.  The film is set in England, which is the last orderly spot on earth and which has become both armed encampment and police state, struggling both to control the populace at home and keep the rest of the world out.  The world crisis has been created by the sudden infertility of all the women in the world.  I normally would hestitate to reveal the next detail, but since advertisements for the movie have been giving it away there is no point in playing coy.  Theo, played by Clive Owen, is recruited to help assist a young black immigrant girl to a location where she can escape from England by vote.  The reason she is so important is simple:  she is pregnant.<br /><br />I won't spoil anymore of the plot.  I think this is a film that is best seen with minimal knowledge.  I will say that I have never seen a film that is more viscerally real than this one.  There are numerous action sequences that feel so realistic that they almost feel real than rigged.  This is not typical movie special effects, which usually are exaggerated to make it more theatrical.  The action is more muted, but also vastly more realistic, so that you almost feel that it is happening around you.  It is not always an easy movie to watch.  As Theo and Kee, the young girl played wonderfully by newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey, wend their way through the chaos around them, you feel at times that the world is on the verge of collapse.  Some here have criticized the ending.  I found it moving and deeply touching, as well, as I mentioned above, quietly optimistic.<br /><br />Almost everything about this movie stands out.  The design of the film is outstanding.  It feels both futuristic and yet still very much like the world we live in now.  The cinematography is outstanding and the special effects as good as you will see without using CGI (there was CGI, but what I'm praising are the non-CGI effects).  The direction by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is deft throughout and on the heels of such diverse successes as Y TU MAM&Aacute; TAMBI&Eacute;N, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN (still by far the best film in that series), and THE LITTLE PRINCESS further establishes himself as one of the world's most fascinating directors.  And the acting is impeccable.  Clive Owen is simply one of the world's finest actors and this is his finest performance yet.  The film is buttressed by a number of supporting performances.  Although he hasn't yet had a break out performance to establish his popular reputation, Chiwetel Ejiofor has through a number of fascinating performances established himself as one of the worlds most versatile and gifted actors (try watching this film along with his performances in SERENITY, KINKY BOOTS, and DIRTY PRETTY THINGS and you'll get an idea of his talent and range).  Michael Caine is superb as a hippy journalist.<br /><br />I rarely like to comment on DVD special features because I don't think most people watch them and partly because it is never why I buy a DVD anyway.  But this disc has some of the best special features I've ever seen.  They explain how they performed some of the amazing special effects in the film.  I definitely recommend watching them.<br /><br />Just a word or two about astonishingly low rating this film is getting here on Amazon.  If this isn't a five star movie, the rating makes no sense.  Critics have been beside themselves in raving about this movie and ordinary fans and viewers are not giving this low ratings elsewhere.  On IMDB.com, for instance, it currently has a 8.1 User Rating and is #149 on the list of the 250 most highly rated films.  It really is that good.  I can only speculate on who is giving it such low ratings, but let me caution potential viewers that this is not a blockbuster adventure film.  If your idea of a great movie is SAHARA or NATIONAL TREASURE, you will find this to be a shocking disappointment.  But if you enjoy more artistically rendered films, like art films, and like more serious rather than merely commercial films, you will love this.  In my opinion it was, along with PAN'S LABYRINTH and THE LIVES OF OTHERS, one of the three truly great films of 2006 (though it went into general release in 2007, it had a limited 2006 release).

I like everyone else heard \\"Home\\" on the radio but nothing else so i took a chance and bought the CD. the song that i really loved was and is \\" Quando,Quando, Quando\\" with Nelly Furtado. i have played \\"Save the last dance for me\\" at several weddings and it goes over great. other covers like \\" can't but me love\\" and \\"I've got you under my skin\\" are GREAT renditions that do the original more than justice. This CD is a can't miss with anybody out there who enjoys a different sound then what today's music has 2 offer.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I actually own eight different versions of Jane Eyre on DVD, and this is the one to own.  When a beloved novel is converted to film, a lot of choices have to be made.  I feel that most directors make specific choices to see their personal vision realized while trying to stay true to the novel in order to appease the Literati.  Each version I've seen has certain aspects that are admirable and certain problems.  Since this review is not about those other versions, I will just say outright that this  Jane Eyre is the first one to successfully capture a genuine chemistry between Jane and Rochester.  Yes, it deviates here and there from the novel, but all the most important aspects are there and the relationship between Rochester and Jane is nothing less than magic.  Finally we can comprehend the complex emotions between them, and we can understand where the mutual attraction comes from.  I have a certain fondness for some of the other versions (Orson Welles for movie length and Timothy Dalton for mini-series) if you want only one Jane Eyre, this is absolutely the one.

0684830515|4.0|\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" helped to put Pamplona on the map and showcased the sport of bullfighting to the world.  Although the sport certainly was thriving in Spain before Hemingway's novel, it was he who helped introduce bullfighting to the world.  Yet, his book could not have had such an impact if it was not imbued with a compelling story, vivid descriptions, and powerful imagery. <br /> <br />Hemingway explores the aimless lives and sexual exploits of Jake and his fellow compatriots in 1920s Paris.  Veterans of World War I, these are members of the \\"Lost Generation\\", who spent their youth in foxholes in abominable conditions and have never fully recovered.  Jake, literally, is impotent from a war wound, and the others show scars in their emotions and relationships with each other.  Although there are no flashbacks to their horrific experiences, it is evident that the war weighs down on their minds and has had a profound impact on their philosophy of life.  Although on the surface their carefree, promiscuous lifestyle may lend a sense of joy and fulfillment, despair and depression lie just beneath their surface, as evidenced by their excessive alcohol abuse.  It is rare that either Jake or one of his cohorts are not intoxicated. <br /> <br />Although Jake may be literally impotent, the other male characters show a symbolic impotence in their approach toward their lives.  The sexpot, Brett, has a tenuous hold on them, as she is the reason of the moment to live.  Yet, their affairs with Brett ultimately leaves them cold and distant.  Cohn, an ex-boxer and currently a writer of Jewish descent, is a scapegoat for all that goes wrong in their lives.  Although he is no choir boy, Cohn becomes a punching bag for the others, both literally and figuratively, as their frustrations mount.  The heightened sense of hostilities between Cohn and the others is not because of his Jewish heritage, but because of their own insecurities with their manhood, a direct result of the life-altering war. <br /> <br />Hemingway uses a direct, no-nonsense approach in his writing.  There is neither flowery prose nor endless paragraphs of illustrative descriptions.  Hemingway's words are power-packed and provide the most poignant imagery in the least amount of words.  Hemingway does not mince words.  It is his direct style that is, perhaps, his greatest asset, and that which has gained him fame. <br /> <br />Hemingway is at his best when describing the fiesta and bullfights with all its pomp and splendor.  Even without a detailed description of the gore involved in bullfighting, Hemingway delivers to the reader a vivid and imaginative description of the event.  A detailed picture is given of how the bulls are driven to their deaths, yet Hemingway maintains a tactful and elegant approach in his prose. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" provides great insight into the \\"Lost Generation\\", while providing an entertaining account of the Pamplona \\"Running of the Bulls\\" and the ensuing bullfight.  This may be one of Hemingway's earlier works, but it is certainly one of his best.  Superb. <br />
1577312082|5.0|Strong words but if you listen to the news, read the paper, go to a mall, look around you, you'll have to agree that something needs to change. At the core of all spiritual teachings is Presence. Presence is our natural state. However at some point in our evolution, perhaps as we bemcame more occupied with controling our environment, we developed our mind. What our prehistoric ancestors started with keeping a few burning embers glowing evolved to present day power plants and as a large club may have been the first weapon, today we have weapons of mass destruction. These advances have been made through the use of our intellect, our minds. When we are using our mind, ie. thinking, it is impossible to be present for we can only think about the past or the future. And most all of us spend our entire lives in a state of habitual repetitive thought, one after another, the vast majority of which is needless. This \\"addiction\\" not only consumes energy, causes stress and anxiety but it cuts us off from the wisdom which we all possess. We have reached the point where our minds are no longer serving us. In fact, as Eckhart Tolle explains, if our species is to survive we must make the transition to a state of being which is beyong the mind. Tolle gives advice on simple things one can do throughout the day to connect with the present moment. Through consistent practice one begins to notice moments of stillness and peace and a deeper acceptance for what is going on in your life at this moment. We find a new sense of connectedness with ourselves as well as those around us. But this can only be done \\"Now.\\"

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card follows young boy Ender Wiggins, who at the start of this book is a six year old genius.  Young Ender lives in a future Earth which has unified by treaty in the aftermath of a war versus an enigmatic Alien enemy.  The war versus the \\"buggers,\\" as the Aliens have come to be called due their insectoid appearance, took place 50 years previously and would have destroyed Earth if it were not for the heroic actions against nearly impossible odds by one Starship Commander, Mazer Rackham.  Earth is in preparation for further conflict with the Bugger menace and is in desperate need to groom soldiers who can protect humanity from extinction.  Thus, it is a glorius honor for children to be selected for the military.  Hegemony leadership has put strict limits on the amount of children that can be born, and many are genetically engineered for the purpose of serving in the military. <br /> <br />Ender is the third child of his family and thus is the recipient of the scorn of others that comes with his outlawed status. He and his siblings, an older brother Peter, and older sister Valentine have been born at the behest of the government and military and therefore monitored all of their lives for their potential.  Peter has been found too vicious and Victoria to pacifist and thus rejected, however Ender has not and he is sent to battle school. <br /> <br />Ender's game is a story of isolation, innocence, ruthlessness and ultimately compassion.  Ender is a manipulated pawn, a great and intelligent leader in the body of a child, who although mature in intelligence is still just a boy.  Ender's innocence must be sacrificed that the world may be saved.    <br /> <br />Ender's story is utterly contemporary.  Ender displays his complete humanity and the ability to demonstrate great compassion, while at the same time knowing that to defeat great evil, one must crush it completely.  He faces great challenges which threaten to tear his mind apart and snuff out his soul and it is in this journey and the universally understood themes that make this a very, very compelling book. <br /> <br />Ender's Game is considered one of Science Fictions seminal works, winning both a Nebula and Hugo award and a New York Times best seller, and it is well deserved.  This book connects strongly with the reader and its spectacular ending is thoroughly memorable.  Card has crafted a book whose themes are thought provoking and at the same time definitive in universal and moral truths.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|First, i like science fiction, i have since i was a child. i also like dysutopic visions of the future so added this to my listmania on this topic.<br /><br />Second, get or rent the 2 disc set, the commentaries are not the usually shovelware, but rather thoughtful pieces put together for the DVD from interviews with philosophers and other thinkers about the movie and it's ideas.<br /><br />There are lots of good reviews talking about the filming-spectacular, the actors-excellent, Michael Caine as a gray long haired pot smoking hippy with a brain dead wife-more than cute, and a few about how the movie tries to bite off more than it can really chew, or us for that matter. some of the reviews here are particularly good and worth reading.<br /><br />I first encountered the world without kids in my several summers walking in China. During the days the only time you see kids is if you pass by a school. Even on the weekends there is a noticable lack of kids. Analogous to a yuppie supermarket versus the nearby Spanish speaking low priced store. No kids in the yuppie aisles of wines and frozen food, lots of choices, but no kids. Now image a world where the youngest person, who is 18 dies. That is the setting.<br /><br />The world is more than a bit threadbare, fraided about the edges, worn and tired.

B0007G89G4|5.0|Hailed as one of the essential coming-of-age films, \\"Stand by Me\\" has stood the test of time to become a classic. Since most of the other reviews talk about the plot, I'll just talk about my opinion of the movie. <br /> <br />The first time I watched it, I was in awe as the credits rolled. It has since gone on to become one of my all-time favorites. Everything about this movie was executed perfectly--the writing, the performances, the direction, the score--EVERYTHING!! It made me want to be a kid again, and not many movies make me feel like that. I could relate with the characters, especially Gordie, and that's another reason this film stands out in my mind.  <br /> <br />I don't want to keep running on, so I'll just sum it up--buy this film, you will definitely NOT be disappointed!
B00005JPAO|4.0|It's easy to see from Helen Mirren's performance why the Best Actress Oscar category was really no contest this year.  Still, the subject matter still has some feel of tabloid sensationalism, with its dramatization of political scrambling in the aftermath of the shocking death of Diana, Princess of Wales.<br /><br />No one the movie seems to care about the tragedy itself - only how to secure their personal positions in the eyes of the public. There was no real grief for Diana, and that is indescribably sad.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"The Queen\\" goes back to what Ms. Mirren said in her Oscar acceptance speech: that Elizabeth Windsor has weathered so many storms in her 50-plus years on the throne. The movie certainly does justice to Her Majesty's indomitable strength, and the legacy that she is leaving for history.
6305546789|5.0|This is one of the greatest horror films ever made and deserves a place on every horror film fans shelf. Made on a showstring budget of about $300,000 it went on to become the most successful independent movie of all time.<br /><br />The film is directed by John Carpenter, who at this time was churning out cult classics every year or two. Carpenters use of the camera as the killers view set a trend that continues to this day. Of course 'The Shape' as he came to be known, is a truly nightmarish creation. He wears a mask, which apparently was originally a Captain Kirk mask which one of the crew adapted! He's virtually indestructible, totally inhuman and one of the scariest killers ever.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis is pretty good, but the main reason to watch this from an acting point of view is Donald Pleasence who plays Dr Sam Loomis. Pleasence's role is crucial to the film, as some of the lines he has to deliver are, well a little clunky, such as<br /><br />\\"He's gone from here, The evil is gone\\".<br /><br />However Pleasence delivers them, good or bad, with conviction and gives a fantastic performance.<br /><br />Another reason this film works is Carpenters creepy musical score, which racks up the tension at all the right points.<br /><br />I'll give the final word to Dr Loomis:<br /><br />\\"I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face and, the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes! I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil!\\"
B00007AJF9|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It is amazing to watch the character visibly grow up from a young frightened girl to the powerful queen whose riegn is called the \\"Golden Age\\".  The music and costumes are both amazing, the dialogue is witty and the use of historical quotes brings a sense of authenticity to the film.  If women such as Elizabeth I, Catherine the Great, or Cleopatra interest you this film will definately be for you.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|Don't expect this to be a foot tapper-dinner-party-mixer. Yes, there are some beautiful passages and softer moments. But, put the kids to bed because the band jumps on it hard and it gets jagged, manic, vocals straining-splitting-piercing. Demonic organ blasts and double saxaphone passages all beautifully arranged and held together by exquisite drumming. So, If your a prog rock fan and you don't have VdGG in your collection. I'd say this album and \\"H to He who am the only one\\" are the places to start when considering VdGG's earlier albums. Later release's like Godbluff, World Record, Still Life, will make their way into your collection in due time.
0439813786|5.0|One day driving home, I heard Brian Selznick on NPR saying \\"his pencil sketches carry the story forward\\" while referring to 'The invention of Hugo Cabret'. And then the interviewer drew parallels between his opening sketches and the beginning of a movie. That piqued my curiosity about the book. <br /> <br />That very evening I requested the Title from my local library and had the 500-page heavy, black fore-edged book with me in a few days. The size was daunting, it almost matched the latest JK Rowling's output in thickness.  <br /> <br />But then the size was misleading. There were pencil sketches, many many many sketches (hence the blackened fore-edges) through out the book - they carry the story forward beautifully (and increase the thickness of the book). For all its thickness, you can run through the story within a couple of hours (but then that way you would miss out on the beauty of those sketches). If you can't wait to get to end, you should revisit the pencil works later..Some of them zoom you in into details - giving you the feel of movie maker's camera moving from an extremely wide angle shot to an extremely close-up one, no cuts in between. Awesome!  <br /> <br />The story is fun too. Its about a talented orphan finding a home and a vocation. (100 year old French movies also work their way nicely into the story.) Simple when stated that way, but 'the how of it' is very interesting. If you dig comics and good stories, this one is definitely for you.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I went into this movie with the most negative attitude<br /><br />and came out a born again baby! First I love Bond and<br /><br />have seen most of the movies from 60's till now.

B000008I4Z|5.0|So after CLUTCHING AT STRAWS, singer Fish left the band. In comes Steve Hogarth for 1989s SEASON'S END, a terrific balance of staying true to their art and moving forward. Next came HOLIDAYS IN EDEN, an obvious attempt by he band and the record company to go for popular appeal. HOLIDAYS has some terrific material, and I would that all pop had its level of musical integrity. So what did the band do next? A friggin concept album--and guess what? They scored a huge hit with the fans. BRAVE is what Marillion listeners were waiting for since MISPLACED CHILDHOOD. BRAVE is moody, depressing, tragic, touching and rocking. It may make you cry. It certainly will hold your attention if you let ot sink in and if you really listen. I bought the CD upon its release many years ago. I listened to it several times and some tracks caught my interest while others did not. That's fine. Many years later I began to give the album as a whole more attention. The full picture began to develop for me. Generally, BRAVE will show up as one of the top Marillion albums among fans, and it deserves to be.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Instead of a new Sabbath album, we get this.  Now I know a new Sabbath album is in the works, but that's just what the fans want to hear - new material.  Nevertheless, Dio's greatest hits with Sabbath is still a swell purchase.  Odds are if you are a true Sabbath fan, you already own all the Dio-era Sabbath, but now you can own all the goodies in one CD.  Post Dio Sabbath was mediocre at best, so you can be rest assured that Dio Sabbath is as good as it was going to get.<br /><br />After reviewing the tracks on here, I'm a little upset that Southern Cross was not on here.  If there's one song that pulls out the best from Iommi and Dio, it's that one.  It's got edge, balls, and guts.  However, the rest of the tracks are pure classics and definitely do not disappoint.  So, if you're a fan, you'll probably by it cause you like to collect things.  If you already own the previous albums, the choice is yours.  The only discernable difference that I can tell is the obvious production value.  Mob Rules sounds horrible on its own, and the few tracks from Mob Rules will sound great on this disc.
B000N3ST9I|4.0|Well, that's 2 great albums in a row from this band that had at one time abandoned its greatness in favor of the trendy nu-metal/rapcore sound.  Remember Robb Flynn with the spiked hair?  And the music to go along with it? Forget it!! It is now well in the past! <br /> <br />The Blackening is another return to the groove-laden thrash sound they first put out on Burn My Eyes.  Any nu-metal tendencies you might have thought were present on Ashes of Empires are now gone.  Pure, down-tuned,groove-thrash!  THIS is what nu-metal SHOULD have been. <br /> <br />A few years ago they were playing with bands like Saliva and Powerman 5000 (yikes!).  I just saw them open up for Trivium and Lamb of God.  Redemption, pride, and honor -- all hail Machine Head! <br /> <br />
B000H5V8DG|5.0|This box set is incredible. It's a must-have for any Alias fan! If you're a collector, you'll love this set. It's the most unique box set I own. The lid is magnetic, and the sides of the box flip up and magnetize to the lid. The design of the box even references the show with Irina inscribed on the lid. This set is well worth the money.
B00000IWVS|5.0|A most interesting history in the liner notes and a fabulous recording. One of the best for a piano CD collection.
1581806574|5.0|A great book. Starts from the basics and gives good easy to understand directions. Recommended for anyone that would like to learn to draw dragons and other such creatures.
B000MV9026|4.0|This movie started much as I expected. I took my 9 & 11 year old boys and hoped that it would be at least somewhat entertaining for me as well as them. The emperor penguins are, save for Mumble the main character, all blessed with beautiful R & B singing voices. The characters played by Robin Williams provide a great deal of comic relief. Mumble and his new friends, all single and on the prowl, have great fun sliding down mountains and cutting each other up. But the second half of the movie switched gears and showed a more serious side as Mumble begins his search for the answer to their food shortage.     Unfortunately we (humans)are the bad guys as our overfishing has put them in peril. The movie presents a lot of good talking points to discuss with your children. This movie should be included in any family DVD collection. It has a lot more substance than most every other similar film.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|Being new to Brandi Carlile and therefore judging this album on its own, I would call this Americana 2.0: revised and updated.  More than many of the bands that typically get the Americana label, I think Carlile really comes close to summing up the best of American music over the past century.  In these songs you get flavors of appalachian folk balladry, grunge rock edginess, Nashville country pop, even a tinge of punk rock, and lots more.  The lyrics are direct and introspective, no symbol-hunting type poetry, just laying it all on the line.   <br /> <br />Perhaps that barebones attitude is one reason Carlile shines the  most when she strips down the production and goes with just a couple of guitars and a vocal.  This arrangement produces what I think are the most tight and poignant tracks (\\"Have You Ever\\" and \\"Josephine\\"). <br /> <br />So overall, I think she's a promising artist who has a rare ability to create a niche for herself in the space between many different styles, and hopefully we will see this come together even more on subsequent albums.  In the meantime, she puts together a folk-rock hook as good as anyone, and that alone is worth the price of the album.
B00005JPMZ|3.0|If anyone is close with Raphael and can snatch a few smoke pellets from him, throw one in front of this new TMNT movie. Chances are, movie-watchers who aren't fans of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles probably won't enjoy this one. Thus, I only recommend this movie to fans of the turtles. Even as a fan of many years, I was somewhat disappointed, but I was entertained regardless.<br /><br />Pros: the animation and visuals are stellar, and there is plenty of action.<br /><br />Cons: the jokes and dialogue are cheesy, and the story isn't exciting.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I had heard good things about Blokus and all of the awards it has won, but it is hard to know if a game will be good without playing it. Eventually I purchased it on faith, and was not disappointed. The rules are easy to learn, even for my four-year-old son and my grandmother. Everyone who plays the game loves it. The game seems to be contagious.
B000M341QE|1.0|I ordered this the night of the Oscars. I will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy. There wasn't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging. It looks like a bad VHS transfer. I should have returned it, but it would've been more trouble than it was worth. <br />I thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately, in my case, I have to add: buyer beware.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|This album is quite a bit of a departure from Avril's previous records. Complete with handclaps and cheer-like chants, The Best Damn Thing is somewhat reminiscent of the girl band pop craze of the nineties though some choice expletives and influences from mainstream pop-punk culture sort of complicate the comparison. This is no masterpiece lyrically or musically and demonstrates an overall lack of maturity in Avril's music when most would expect the opposite from the now 22 year-old, newly wed artist. Even still, this album is quite cute in the catty dance-around-the-room-in-your-underwear sort of way, and I suspect it will serve mainly as the guilty pleasure hidden under beds and in drawers. This album could easily have served as the soundtrack for the movie Bring It On  and falls into the category of the pop group the Veronicas. Pass this up if you're looking for something profound, this one is strictly just for fun (if you're brave enough to admit it)...

0765348276|5.0|John Perry joins the Colonial Defense Force, at the age of 75. The CDF takes the elderly Perry and turns him into a killing machine that any Starship Trooper would be proud to see. While amazed with his new body, he struggles with being less than human. Perry goes off to war fighting the enemies of humanity and deals with the horrors of war.<br /><br />Fans of Heinlein should find Scalzi's style and story highly entertaining. He manages give Old Man's War the air of a hard sci-fi story without the technical jargon so many others use. There is no need of a degree in rocket science to understand this book. However, the explaination of the science involved does not seem to have been dumbed down or overly handwavist (if such a word exists).<br /><br />Old Man's War is with out a doubt the best sci-fi novel I have read in well over a decade. There is plenty of action and the character developement gets you invested in the story.Scalzi's crystal clear and easy to read style makes Old Man's War a great new entery into the sci-fi genre.
B000005RFQ|4.0|I loved the dark feel to this cd. The guitar solos sparkle and Gillan's voice is awesome. I think it ranks amongst his best. 'Trashed' is killer, 'Disturbing the Priest' and 'Zero the Hero' are haunting. 'Digital Bitch' is a driving, cool song. The band sounds revived and fresh with Ian G singing. This CD has gotten better with age.<br /><br />Wont break every song down, but this is a must have. Probably one of the heaviest cds of the 80's. Overlooked in Sabbath's catalog.
075640407X|5.0|Don't really know what to say, so I'll let some other eggheads ramble on about characterization, plot development and all the other literary crap you're supposed to put in a review.

B000H5U832|5.0|Got the movie for my nephew.  He loved it.  So did I.  Needless to say we are all \\"cars\\" now.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Fans of any of the Final Fantasy games will likely enjoy this movie, as will fans of the realistic computer-generated films, including this one's predecessor, 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within'. I never played the games, and I had no major problems understanding the plot of the movie, as there is a fairly helpful voice-over intro that explains the basic world and the current problem and nemesis. For those who need more background, watch the Special Features Disk first; it has an overview of most of the games, done in sprite format (seems to be cut and pasted from the different major cut scenes). It will fill in a lot of gaps, for those who want to know what's going on in more detail before they watch the film. The character designs are lovely, and the plot is engaging. I am generally a fan of subtitles, but in this case, both the Japanese and English language versions are equally pleasant and 'in-character' for lack of a better word, with the exception of Sephiroth in the English (he sounds sick). Overall the movie is visually stunning, with a detailed enough plot and interesting enough characters to make it worth watching over and over.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|Great soundtrack to the 80's era cable special.  Carl shows the boys a few tricks in a fantastic jam session.  Don't pass this up.
1932907009|5.0|I have published plays and fiction, plus a few nonfiction items, but I have always wanted to be a successful screenwriter and have been struggling mightily toward that goal for five years or so. Like so many other would-be screenwriters, I've read books from the masters, and most of them were excellent books.  However, I hadn't really yet come across a book that seemed to speak directly to me until I came across Save the Cat. Not only is the book packed with lots of useful, practical information, but it's written in a style that's a joy to read.  Humorous, practical, and above all, useful.  I know other reviewers have said this, but I wish I had had this book when I started screenwriting. Snyder covers everything from the logline to beats to practical ways to troubleshoot your script.  One of the most helpful things to me was the glossary in the back.  Every \\"Hollywoodish\\" term Snyder uses he gives a simple definition for in the glossary.  For the first time, I believe I can actually understand the lingo. Some chapters that were especially helpful to me were chapter two, a discussion on genre; Chapter four, a section on structure; and Chapter six, common sense screenplay rules.<br /><br />These are just my favorite chapters; I found helpful information in every single one -- no exaggeration.  In discussing genre, Snyder doesn't just use the basic ones like romance or science fiction. Read \\"The Monster in the House\\" to see just one example of a genre.  He also writes on such topics as \\"The Pope in the Pool.\\"  I could go into a lot more of the book, but you can't get the benefit of it unless you read it yourself.  I have had consultations, I have had coverage, and I have even taken one of the best online screenwriting courses out there, but I could have bought this book and saved myself a lot of money -- not that the other experiences weren't good ones because they were.  This book just brings all you need to know right in one spot.  I am going to be ordering the sequel to this one right away.  By the way, Snyder gives you his email in the book, and yes, he did answer me when I dropped him a note. I don't know if that would mean anything to you, but it meant a lot to me.o this one right away.

B000GFLKF8|5.0|Director Spike Lee hits box-office gold with a New York heist thriller that never lapses into cliche. \\"Inside Man\\" also makes some telling social observations while delivering plenty of surprises. Lee provides a fine acting ensemble (Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer) with an inventive screenplay from Russell Gewirtz and excellent cinematography by Matthew Libatique. The result is a crackerjack entertainment and one of Lee's most accomplished films.
B0007R4TAS|1.0|The film would be interesting and the acting is good, but there are lines streaking the film and odd bursts of green color and the general color is faded and there are skips in the film as well. It is so bad it is hard to watch.  Amazon sent me a second copy and it was just as bad in exactly the same way.  It didn't seem to be worth it to bother again for the $5 cost of the DVD and I like Amazon too much to want to charge them for the postage.  I have never received a DVD with such awful quality.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is the best Bond Movie to date. The new bond has a real edge to him. Not as many gadgets in this film but the action and plot make up for it
B000N6TX22|5.0|This movie is phenomenal. It blew me away. My husband and I rate it in our top 5 of all-time. It really is cinema genius the way this movie was put together. Just because the movie did not give you a happy ending or perfectly tied up all open-ended questions when it ended is no reason to tear it apart. I think the people knocking this movie are probably the same people who enjoy \\"Scary Movie\\" and \\"White Girls\\".<br /><br />Don't miss this movie.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|This movie was surprisingly good. I went into it, not expecting much after recently watching the Fantastic Four movie. Ghost Rider starts off with a young Johnny Blaze, teamed up with his father, who is sick. He makes a deal with the Devil and sells his soul to heal his father. Unfortunately, the Devil never strikes a bargain with fairness in mind and Johnny is left to wait for the Devil to call. When the Devil calls, the special effects were actually amazing. The story was a bit on the short side with an ending that left a bit to be desired. Overall, this IS a fun movie to watch and the action is consistent throughout. This one will be added to my library when it's released. Enjoy.
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins does an excellent job of building a strong case for atheism by using logic and science in \\"The God Delusion\\".  He shows the logical fallacies of the so-called proofs of Gods existence.  He debunks the myth about religion being the source of morality and ethics, debunks other myths about the immorality of non-believers.  He exposes some of the logical inconstancies and errors within the religions themselves.  All in all, he does an outstanding job of explaining why atheism is on much firmer ground than any of the major religions. <br /> <br />There are some problems with the book as well, but before I go into those it is important to note that this is definitely a good book for religious people as well as atheists and agnostics to read.  It gives a good explanation of why atheists don't believe in a god or gods, and probably deserves an overall rating of around 3.75 stars.  So while I will go into some more detail about what I thought was not so good about the book that is merely because it is necessary to be more detailed about the problems than it is to be about the parts which are well done. <br /> <br />The weaknesses of the book all stem from one source, and that is that Dawkins, like everyone, is too close to the subject.  It is probably impossible for anyone to take a completely dispassionate look at this subject, as we all have had to deal with various religions throughout our lives.  On several occasions, Dawkins ventures out from his base of logic and science to make assumptions which are based only on his thoughts and not facts.  For example, in Chapter 10, \\"A Much Needed Gap\\" he implies that religious people should be happy when a loved one is about to die, and goes on to imply that because they aren't it is somehow significant in the argument.  However, people grieve for a variety of reasons, and not necessarily because they don't truly believe in heaven.  As an atheist, I grieve for the absence in my life of a loved one, and there is noreason to believe that religious people don't feel the same sense of loss, regardless of whether they believe that person is going to heaven. <br /> <br />Another example is in Chapter 5 on \\"Why There Almost Certainly Is No God\\" where he correctly states that \\"since we are alive, eukaryotic and conscious, our planet has to be one of the intensely rare planets that has bridged all three gaps\\", or in short that it doesn't matter how improbable our existence is, because we exist we must have beaten those odds.  What he fails to do though, is accept that same argument for the improbability of the existence of God.  One could just as easily say that if God exists, that it doesn't matter how improbable its existence is.  Of course, we don't have proof of God's existence, but the point is that if we are here because of the existence of a God, then its probability becomes irrelevant.  The argument works in both cases, and while it is fair to say that the case for evolution is more probable, that doesn't prove that God doesn't exist. <br /> <br />Probably the worst chapter is Chapter 9 on \\"Childhood, Abuse and Religion\\".  In this chapter, Dawkins argues that bringing up a child in a specific religion is a form of abuse.  However, he really offers no way of solving this supposed problem.  Would he have the State take children away and raise them?  Would he require that people be at least 18 before they are allowed to attend services?  And if so, how would he monitor what the parents tell the children at home?  He ignores the fact that everything that parents do in raising their children can be for good or ill.  They might spoil them with gifts or be too strict.  They might teach them bad eating habits which will lead to health problems.  The entire argument is based on emotionalism and is irrational, and it offers no answers.  The vast majority of parents do a very good job of raising their children, whether they raise them in a specific faith or not. <br /> <br />Now that Ihave beat up on the book a little, let me finish by saying once again that despite its flaws, this is a very good book and enjoyable to read.  The vast majority of the material is presented in a rational way.  Dawkins really grabs the reader's attention, and I am sure that religious people would enjoy debating in their minds the points Dawkins makes just as much as I did.  This book is a much better look at atheism and the problems with religion than Harris' \\"The End of Faith\\".  It is not perfect, but I have no problem rounding \\"The God Delusion\\" up to four stars. <br />
006074815X|5.0|Die Nadel/Henry Faber, a Nazi spy placed in London, England, was the best German agent. He was supposed to go to a large base in southern England. The base was just a fake, an attempt to try to fool the Germans into an attack at Calis, France. The invasion really took place in Normandy.  <br /> <br />I really enjoy reading about World War II, especially anything involving the Allies. This book put me into Faber's shoes and I wanted him to succeed. I recommend this book very highly. It was really hard to put down.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Djimon Hounsou, who has an impressive life story himself, offers an intense performance of Solomon Vandy, a man separated from his family when the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) invades his village in Sierra Leone, killing women and children, and taking many young boys captive to serve as RUF soldiers (which has actually happened. It is estimated that some 120,000 children are currently involved in armed conflicts across Africa). Among the boys taken is Vandy's son Dia. <br /> <br />Solomon is put to work by the RUF, standing knee-high in a river, sifting through silt, panning for diamonds, which are traded for arms. A fellow worker is shot immediately by the boss when he is seen taking a small diamond from the pan and placing it in his mouth. Shortly after, Solomon finds a rather large diamond and, realizing that a diamond of such value could change his life and save his family, he carefully places it between his toes to hold beneath the water. <br /> <br />He is caught trying to bury the diamond moments later, but a sudden military attack on that particular RUF diamond operation buys him some time to run and bury the diamond a short distance away. Moments later he is captured and jailed by the government forces along with many RUF soldiers. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio does great job as Danny Archer, a former mercenary from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) who served in the 32 Battalion of the South African Defence Force. He is now a diamond smuggler who works for his former commander, Colonel Koetzee, played by Arnold Vosloo. Having been caught smuggling diamonds into Liberia, Archer is arrested and placed in jail. There he hears Solomon and his RUF leader, who had seen him take the diamond, shouting about the diamond which Solomon denies knowledge of. Archer's interest is piqued and upon his release he arranges the release of Vandy, and meets with him to learn more about the diamond. <br /> <br />Vandy at first resists, but realizing that Archer may be his best chance at seeing his family, and getting his son back, agrees to take him to the diamond. <br /> <br />With the help of journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) they locate Vandy's family, but not his son. Soon they realize that the boy may have been taken to fight with the RUF <br /> <br />Archer and Vandy pilfer some supplies from Koetzee's installation, and head back to locate the diamond. They stumble upon an RUF outpost and Vandy spots his son. Dia, brainwashed by his captors, seems to not recognize his father. Vandy creates a scene and Archer takes cover in the jungle, escaping detection as the leader, Vandy's nemesis from his original capture, enters the scene. Vandy is tied up and faces certain death, but Archer had previously contacted Koetzee to arrange an attack, which quickly ensues.   <br /> <br />An armed helecopter flies over the outpost, guns blaring, as Archer races in to rescue Vandy and his son. They escape, and continue on to locate the diamond. <br /> <br />Finally the diamond is retrieved, and after a struggle in which Koetzee attempts to take the diamond, the three make their way to an area where Archer has arranged a plane to pick them up. Archer is wounded along the way, and sacrifices himself to help Vandy and his son escape toward the air strip. <br /> <br />Archer also contacts Bowen, with whom he had developed some romantic interest, and asks her to do one final favor for him. The emotions play out as she realizes that he is giving up, not seeking assistance and ready to die. But she agrees to assist Vandy in selling his diamond to the company she will ultimately expose for supporting Conflict or \\"Blood\\" Diamond operations in Africa. <br /> <br />The intensity of Blood Diamond cannot be denied. The action is incredible. Great cinematography, great effects, and great acting, especially by Hounsou, who began his acting career on episodes of Beverly Hills 90210, and went on to appear in films like Amistad, Deep Rising, Gladiator, and many others, more recently Constantine and Eragon. He has also made television appearances in episodes of ER and Alias. An actor to watch for. <br /> <br />I've never been a real DiCaprio fan, but after this I think I'll have to give him a second chance. He was right for this roll. A great performance, and I have to give him credit for the accents he had to learn in order to play his part. <br /> <br />Blood Diamond, while dramatically entertaining and full of action, is also an eye-opener, raising awareness of the uprising that ocurred in Sierra Leone between 1991 and 2002. Things shown in the film -- child soldiers, severing limbs and hands -- actually took place. Tragically our greed and desire for such a beautiful jewel can be the root of unimaginable evil and devastation.
B000148KK2|5.0|I have been following and enjoying Diana Krall's career since her debut at the Monterey Jazz Festival. Her amazing talent has been stunning and her ability to interpret and re-interpret jazz classics in immensely pleasing to her fans. I always wondered if she was really enjoying her gifts as much as her fans. This album reveals a multidimensional original talent, exploring her talent and finding her creative voice. I loved it the moment I heard a couple of tracks. I hope we hear many more original and collaborative pieces in the future. This seems like an intimate glimpse into the artist and is a gift to us all.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|Another Ridley Scott triamph. An excellent story told well and filmed magnificiently. Have just visiy=ted the south of France and this movie drought it all back. A good people story. Wonderful
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Even though it won 9 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and despite the fact I've been fond of Anthony Minghella's work in the past...I wasn't expecting much from \\"The English Patient.\\" It's just really not my kind of movie. It takes place during World War II; a majority of the film takes place in the desert, etc. Actually, it's a fantastic movie with fantastic performances that is not only a great film but very entertaining as well.  <br /> <br />Ralph Fiennes plays Almasy, a mysterious man who's is found in a fiery plane crash burned to hell. The man doesn't remember his name and remembers little about himself, but he's soon taken in by a young nurse named Hana (Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her role) and slowly begins to recall his past. But he may be hiding something and that's why a man named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) suddenly shows up, wanting to know more about the mysterious man.  <br /> <br />The movie is simultaneously a war movie, a love story, and a performance piece that gives every actor time to shine. Despite claiming the only Oscar for acting, it isn't even Binoche who turns in the best performance. Feinnes is absolutely fantastic, Dafoe is great as well, and Kristin Scott Thomas as the woman Almasy falls in love with is fascinating to watch. Feinnes, who is wearing heavy makeup to simulate burn scars, gives a very layered performance here and probably deserved the Oscar for this performance (I say probably because I don't recall who won that year). Anyway, even if \\"The English Patient\\" doesn't sound like your cup of tea, rest assured that it is a great film that one should not miss. Great story, fascinating acting, steady-handed direction. It's a real winner. <br />GRADE: A-
B000002WNP|5.0|Great collection of Elvis 60's music. Be sure to treat yourself to the 50's and 70's collection to complete your collection.  There are several songs not included on other cd's.  You won't be disappointed.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is truely a Neil Young in his prime. Its funny how over the years you think to yourself that his voice has never changed, or at least you don't always notice the transition from then to now.. but then you go back to 1971 and you hear how crisp and on the money he was. Especially live stuff from the early days. Neil Young did most of his best recordings live...<br /><br />This is right in the middle of his most creatively jam packed years... you find yourself just before the release of his most succesful Harvest album,... right around the time he was doing songs from Time Fades Away, another great live album that for some reason has been lost to vinyl and 8-track tape for ever to come (two songs are done very nicely here JOURNEY THRU THE PAST and LOVE IN MIND) and still riding on the success of his CSNY stuff.<br /><br />Together you get one hella mix... mostly on the softer side, but there is still a shinning intensity. Also, this may be the coolest DVD I've seen in the Neil Young file.. yet.<br /><br />Not to long ago, Neil released another lost live tape... the one with Crazy Horse around the same time frame. That one has the crunchy extended rockers... this one shows what the people really ate up back in the day... the intimate, acoustic Neil Young. This collection shows, they ate up with good reason. Very nice.
B000002WMH|5.0|Do yourself a favor and order this collection along with the 60's & 70's.  There are songs you won't find on other CD's, and hear Elvis as a regular \\"guy\\" just makes you love him more.
B00004RD54|5.0|Was actually listening to a little Velvet Underground the other night with some peeps, and we got to talking about them. I personally have always enjoyed some of the stuff they did, but have never considered them to be as great as others make them out to be. The banana peel album is pretty cool, real trippy like.. other albums are iffy (though I will say there are goods on them). And what about Lou Reed in general? eh. Solo stuffs not my favorite.<br />Rock and Roll Animal though... This disc rocks the face off the whole VU, Lou Reed thing entirely. If these tunes could be heard once and only once, I would make damn sure that these versions were the ones to be heard.<br />It's not as trippy sounding as the original versions.. the band is very skilled, like a quality jam band would be.  Lou Reed sounds like he took more dope than ever tonight, but he uses it to his advantage. He's right on the money. This is what you want to feel when you do Lou Reed. Dark, and twisted up. Raw, dirty guitars. The songs work together in a whole different way than before to take a on new life... its a rock and roll classic, that many have tried to acheive, but no one has matched.<br />Think Ziggy Stardust? Sorry Bowie, not even close.
B000002WUD|5.0|A great collection of Elvis music.  A must have for any Elvis fan.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|To Joe: <br />Good catch, also some of the songs are from Chester's old band \\"Grey Daze.\\" (See my previous review)  I, too, am tired of all this claiming to of heard the new album knowing that they are all listening to the fake. <br /> <br />Wait until the album comes out.
0743289412|5.0|Those of you who are fans of Stephen King's \\"fantasy\\" novels, rather than the horror for which he is traditionally known, are in for a real treat. The language in Lisey's Story is reminiscent of the dreamy, allegorical style used in \\"Rose Madders\\", whilst the narrative itself literally takes us to another land, (\\"Boo'ya Moon\\").Likewise, the atmosphere of Boo'ya Moon itself seems to echo King's short story \\"Mrs. Todd's Shortcut\\", that same sense of other, stranger worlds, just a hair's breadth away... <br />Other reviewers refer to the \\"impenetrable\\" language of the novel. For me, this \\"secret language\\" only emphasized a sense of wonder and mystery, of entering new worlds - literally, in the instance of Boo'ya Moon, and metaphorically - the marriage of Lisey and Scott. This story-specific use of language also served another purpose - it contributed to my sense of leaving something behind when I finished reading - that sense of wishing to know more of these people, whose secrets I had been privy to, and whose lives I had touched upon for a moment.  <br />This ability to create a private vocabulary and to use it seamlessly to evoke a sense of intimacy and disclosure, is King's greatest strength. The plot itself contains moments of skillfull insight; haunting, sometimes frightening imagery,(\\"...the Long Boy, the thing with the endless piebald side...\\"), and, tied together with that intricate delicate web of language only King can spin, it becomes probably the best, most memorable book he has ever written - and my own personal favourite.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I loved this movie, but I felt that Infernal Affairs was a much better film.  Infernal seemed more edgey, but that's not to put down Departed.  I loved the actors of Departed who all played their roles so well, but if you asked me, the original HK version was just a bit better.
B000NNPT8C|1.0|Deleted movie from my TiVo within 5 minutes (of starting it).  lol  I guess I got what I deserved.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|Burt Lancaster gives one of his finest performances in this piercing adaptation of the John Cheever short story, his impressive physique & bearing providing an ironic & painful contrast to his crumbling self-confidence & disillusion. The film passes like a souring dream, compressing a lifetime into a single searing day, as Lancaster's Ned Merrill is inexorably brought up short by the realities of his life. Piece by piece his illusions & aspirations are stripped away, a process reflected in the increasingly harsh & unflattering lighting of the film.<br /><br />When did it all go wrong for Ned? There are hints that even as a child, he pursued an unreachable ideal. Was he simply too sensitive from the very start? Or were his childhood ideals subsumed in his ego, in the privilege he took for granted? Somewhere along the way, he lost himself in the facade of success he wore like golden armor, which couldn't protect or console him in the end. This is the fate of the American man who buys into an empty dream ... it can only dissolve in the taste of wet ashes. Midlife strikes brutally & unforgivingly for such men.<br /><br />The film is 40 years old, but its message is just as timely as ever. If the superficial trappings of success have changed a bit, their hollow essence remains the same, trapping the latest generation of those who buy into the glittering lie. A cautionary tale to be sure, scathing & terribly sad. Most highly recommended!
B000LAZDQA|4.0|John Cameron Mitchell's SHORTBUS is that rarity, a film that manages to be both clear-eyed and idealistic about sex.  The screenplay was developed through improvisational exercises with the actors, and that process shows; at its worst, scenes can feel like being stuck in an acting class that's simply not working.  But, at its best, which is pretty frequent, the proceedings have a unique point of view and a fresh, funny voice.  The cast is enormously likable and fearless.  No matter their orientation, there's bound to be something here that will strike sparks of recognition and amused chuckles from most viewers.  Mitchell's to be applauded for both intentions and achievement here.  Recommended.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|You will not be disappointed - nothing sophomoric about this album. I feel like AF is channeling Springsteen's Nebraska in this album in a way that's much less depressing but just as powerful. If for some bizarre reason you don't like the album IMMEDIATELY, listen to it at least 10 times before you make the call. Love, love, love it.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|I LOVE CLUTCH.  They just keep making awesome music. They are one of the hardest working, most talented bands around, and yet it disturbs me that they haven't become one of the biggest bands in the world. I have all of their releases, and this is a welcome addition to a discography that does not include any mediocre albums. Every release makes you beside yourself while basking in the glory that is Clutch's blues-metal divinity.  <br />Seriously, if you want mind-shredding guitar riffs, thoughtful-meets-psychotic lyrics/vocals, and toe-tapping rhythms, you've come to the right place.

B000FBGBPC|5.0|I enjoyed their debut album quite a bit, but this effort is vastly superior. \\"Animal I Have Become\\" and \\"Pain\\" have been getting the attention as singles, but I believe every song on this album to be worthy of getting radio play.  <br />For the hard rock genre, I think these guys are ushering in the new generation of hard rock. Out with the old (Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden, Alice IN Chains, etc.) and in with the new. While their will always be a special place in my heart and music collection for those old school hard rock/grunge bands, the new hard rock scene is in some capable hands with 3 Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, and others.
