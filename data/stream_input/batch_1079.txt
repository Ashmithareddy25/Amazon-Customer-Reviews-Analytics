B001P9KR8U|5.0|I never felt compelled to see this film, but I saw it one night when nothing else was on HBO.  I am so glad I watched it.  While parts of it made me uncomfortable, it is brilliantly acted, has a moving but uplifting storyline, and is all-around well-crafted.  You will be glad you saw this one!
B003ES61EE|5.0|This simple device consists of two basic parts: a retractable brush and two felt cleaners. The brush is a typical soft synthetic fiber brush. The only problem I had with it was a few fibers falling out in the initial moments of use, but this seems to have stopped.  The felt cleaners are just two very small soft pieces of black chamois treated with a dry cleaning agent. They are useful for removing chunks too sticky or large for the brush.  It seems the only proper way to clean the felts is to wipe them with a dry paper towel. The brush can also be wiped as well as rinsed and wiped dry. The retraction mechanism works well along the same lines as a retractable box-cutter.
1449389627|4.0|The Myths of Innovation covers many misunderstandings of how innovation occurs with examples the reader should be familiar with. While covering the misunderstandings it gives insight into how to enable innovation.    The Myths of Innovation does a good job covering the topic in a way that someone not familiar with innovation should be able to learn important details about the processes of innovating and the examples do a great job of supporting the authors points. One of the key messages being it takes a lot of hard work to create innovative products and you wont get there unless you get started.    While reading I found it quite clear what my organization does right and what areas we need to work on. The downsides being many of the topics were obvious and it seemed like the topic could have been handled in fewer words.

B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blindside is a movie everyone should see. You see a family giving. You see a young man who overcomes horrible circumstances. If you are NOT inspired, take a gut check. Great true story.
0399536108|5.0|Great book. If you are on the road of living like only less then 1% of the world buy and read this book. Come join us!
031603438X|5.0|This book has honesty, intelligence, and warmth. I like that. Richards has a captivating personality and his life makes for a fun read. My favorite parts include: How the band got started. Musical techniques Richards came up with that form part of that trademark Stones sound. Insight into a life on drugs. The inner workings of the band. How he and Jagger compose. How their concerts work. The alpha male psyche -- this guy is a force (and a mind) to be reckoned with. Only a little rock starism, fortunately, mostly very down-to-earth. The bangers and mash recipe is brilliant. One of the best autobios I've read, so good I've already read it twice. Highly recommended.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Excellent movie, got to watch the digital version before the movie even shipped. I only payed [...] what more can you ask for.
B003ZDZ1WG|2.0|I bought this CD because I like the bands new song being played on the radio \\"If I die young\\". However, after purchasing I found out the rest of the songs are not to my lighting. I love country music, but usually stay away from hillbilly type music and that is what fills the rest of this CD. Hopefully, because they are a new band, any future music will be better and I will continue buying it. I usually don't buy an entire CD just because I like the title track.
1400031524|3.0|In this the second book by Henning Mankell, the setting starts in Sweden but then moves to Latvia just as this country is breaking its bonds with Mother Russia.  Mankell attempts to bring the reader into the depths of despair of the newly forming Latvia, but he does not quite execute.<br /><br />The story starts with a life raft carrying two murdered Eastern Europeans landing (with some help) on the shores of Sweden.  It is a very slow and uninspiring first 100 pages.  The characters are paper thin and the story just doesn't beg the reader's empathy.  As the story moves to Latvia, the plot thickens and picks up dramatically as Mankell seems to be on top of his writing as this second phase of the story unfolds.  Detective Wallander is asked to come to Latvia to continue the investigation that was begun in Sweden.  The writing turns to a \\"Le Carre-like\\" spy story and the reader is treated to a myriad of protagonists and possible suspects.  The reader is immersed into the \\"stab in the back\\" Russian sympathizers and their own anti-revolution sentiments.<br /><br />However, the last 100 pages revert back to lame writing and a story that just does not want to end.  This reader can see the potential building in this author, but in this novel, Mankell oversteps his comfort zone too much.  He fails to bring the reader with him throughout the book and turns a promising premise into a somewhat boring effort by simply failing to edit the last 100 pages.<br /><br />I am enjoying reading Mankell knowing that he develops into something special and experiencing this after the fact by reading books written nearly 20 years ago.  This one could really be skipped.  The initial offering was more interesting, but the sophomore slump hits Mankell in this one.
B00003CXA6|5.0|When I was a boy, there were still a sufficient number of Civil War Veterans to lead each Armistice Day parade although the bulk of  the Veterans, most still in their forties, were from the Great War. The War was a living memory partly for that reason but also because the crisis of The Great Depression had generated a need to revive heroic  American myths to reinforce commitment to the American Way as a set of values whose Truth was testified to by the blood spilled to create and preserve them. When last I checked, some decades ago, the estimates varied from 40,000 to 70,000, as the number of Civil War books which had been published. Whatever may be (the essentially unknowable) correct figure, the stream has not diminished. Not a Civil War buff, I have still managed to read new books by the noted British military historian, John Keegan, and by the distinguished American historian, Stephen Sears, who added Gettysburg to his works on the great battles of the war. The point is that few Americans to whom the Civil War still has significance can watch a film such as this without doing so through a conceptual framework which strongly influences what we see. Taking account of the impact on my own interpretive framework as I approach anything on that war,  I can only say that, despite the inevitable limitations and defects, this serious and sober effort to make the battle a moving experience, succeeded for me. No,it is not reality, but it is sufficiently suggestive for an American mind to use it as a springboard into the realities that cannot be shown.  For me, for example, hovering over the nightmarish suggestions of what it means for live men to confront real artillery and real hand held weapons (only a few had the new rapid firing rifles) was the thought of the tens of thousands of Union (and to a lesser extent, Confederate troops, who fought on the defensive) dead who bloodied the soil of Virginia as Grant took command and won in the only way possible, by paying for each step toward Richmond with union corpses and severed body parts.   All in all, this is a good film suitable for almost any American audience.
B0012RCMH4|3.0|this typical album is heavy and ok--but,dont waste yor money on this 2 cd set!!!the songs are not very melodical,and nothing is special--only true fans of hellhammer should buy!
014241543X|3.0|I read this book two years ago when I was in 6th grade.  I was pretty doubful when I read the back of the book, and expected it to let me down and not be the best.  But I stuck through it, and once I got into it a bit, It turned out to be pretty good.  I will say It didn't hook me very well, and parts of the middle of the book made me want to stop reading it and pick up another one, but I finished it and I'm glad I did.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|I pretty much only buy soundtracks fro movies I really like, as do most people, I suspect.  I like soundtracks that move, that are grand, and that tell the story of a movie, without being boring or overly intrusive to other tasks I am doing.  This soundtrack does all of those things.  It matches the feelings and visuals created in the \\"TRON\\" universe.  No regrets on this purchase.
030746363X|5.0|I loved this book, just as I loved his first one.  Tim's fun and irreverent style and personal anecdotes made me want to try the same things. I immediately went out and bought a scale and tape measure and put a chart on my wall to track progress.  \\"Whatever gets measured gets noticed,\\" has always been my mantra at work; now I bring it into my personal life.  I look forward to reading this book several times - I just start slow and add things as I am ready for more.  Thanks Tim.
0452295548|5.0|In May I had two strokes at the age of 30.  In rehab they recommended this book.  It wasn't until after I was out of rehab that I really had the focus and the energy to read this book.  I really should have had someone read this to me or had it on audio because it would have helped me understand more of what was happening and may have given me more strength to push harder. My idea of recovery was to gain what I had back but reading this book helped me understand it is a process of rebuilding your mind and after a stroke you are a different person.  Even though may family members and doctors told me similar thing it just really help to hear it from a person with the actual experience of having a stroke.  Thank you Jill for a great book.
B000UBONPW|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King (R.I.P to both), what else is there to say? Albert King, one of the original three \\"Kings\\" of the blues along with up and coming new master, at the time, Stevie Ray Vaughan. This album will turn even the biggest blues skeptic into a blues loving nut. Listen to the music created by these two while the master, Albert King, listens to now matured \\"little Stevie\\" Ray Vaughan during a live recording session taped in Canada back in 1983. Albert at times is astounded at what Stevie does with his guitar to the point that he pretty much just sits back and watches/listens in amazement. At one point during the recording you can listen to Albert passing the blues baton to Stevie saying \\"I'm about to give this thing up and turn it over to you\\". In effect saying I'm ready to retire, you got it now, take the blues to the next step and show em all whats its about.<br /><br />If you love screaming hot guitar solos and appreciate the blues, you have to add this to your library. If your not a blues fan and want to know what it's about, this is the one to get. It'll turn you on to some awesome blues jams and classics from Albert's Born under a bad sign to T Bone Walkers classic Stormy Monday (One of my personal favorites) and many in between.<br /><br />Sit back turn up the volume and jam out to this one folks, you will not be disappointed. Oh BTW get the DVD and you can actually see them during this jam session. A great buy indeed.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|This review will not critique 300 the movie.  Rather it will be a critique about the blu ray movie quality.  This is not the first time I purchased a blu ray movie and was disappointed by the picture quality.  For some reason, when this movie is played, there is a grain pattern throughout the whole picture.  It really makes watching the movie a disappointment.  I already owned 300 on DVD, so I expected the Blu ray to be a step up in picture quality.  Very disappointed.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I needed a replacement and this was it. Came promptly and was perfect. I have nothing but positives to say. Very great deal as well.
B003U9TDII|5.0|Well, I loved the movie, and I like that the soundtrack takes you there, while still being broad and interesting enough to listen to anytime.  I tend to use soundtrack music as background for other tasks....I like them to be interesting but not overwhelming.  That said, I always look forward to listening to the songs on this soundtrack.  As someone who has many soundtrack albums and songs, I recommend this as one of my new favorites.
0740748475|5.0|Hi. I can't review this item becouse I didn't receive yet. Altought Amazon promised me it would be at my place until December 24th, it's not here yet. Shame on Amazon.
030746363X|1.0|Let me preface this by saying I loved the 4HWW. Although it was rehashed info and nothing new... it was a good product and worth the 20bucks .. the 4 hour body however, is at best MISLEADING. The results are 'real' but YOU WONT GET them? why because they dont give you the whole story. ex: 28 lbs of muscle in 30 days, sure he  (RE)-gained muscle, after getting his body to unnaturally low levels of muscle, water, and glycogen...but he doesnt tell you that. So if you are planning on buying this book. DONT EXPECT TO GET THOSE RESULTS OR EVEN THINGS CLOSE TO THEM WITH ONLY THE INFO GIVEN... the average person will not benefit from this book at all. the experienced person will only feel cheated. The naive person who knows little about the body, and looking for a magic spell will buy this book, be happy and comforted but ultimately not get anything close to the insuated results....as a ferriss fan (previously) I am very dissappointed in this book, 1. because he has set the bar high for it and it does NOT deliever AT all. 2. because although not technically lying, i consider it a total FRAUDUCT. im returning this book to barnes and noble. something i have never done. . . i read at least 1 book a week. SHAME on you TIM, but you are a great marketer and i salute you for that!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This was a resonable price for these cables.  HDMI cables may go down in history as one of the biggest retail rip-offs ever.  No difference between these $8 cables, and the $100 cables at Best Buy.  Even Walmart is over-priced on these cables.    Shipping was fast, and the cables are perfect.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|This is a great western. I think it's one of Clint Eastwood's best. It is a solid 2 hours long and I would recommend it to others to purchase.
B003Y8YXH6|1.0|This was a very poor effort.  At least half the work is unlistenable.  Does not stand the test of time.  A breif fad.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I really liked the Hunger Games.  But this book just seemed like a slightly different version of it, like the editors decided the company needed to make more money off of the same idea.<br /><br />I can't even remember the reason for it, but Katniss ends up having to go back to the arena with some other Hunger Games winners. They do the Hunger Games thing: fight, die, etc. Nothing stands out about this book.  Honestly, I think it was just a bridge to get from book 1 to book 3.<br /><br />Check this book out from the library before spending money on it.  If it turns out you love it, then good for you: buy both it and the third book, Mockingjay.  But, if you're like me and it just seems like a slightly edited copy of the Hunger Games, you'll be glad you didn't waste your money on it.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I wouldn't dream of not seeing this as Harry Potter, whether in print, audio or film, has been a most wonderful experience for me.  However, I did wonder after seeing this movie, whether it had been a mistake to divide the last book into two parts. This is because the pace is slower than either the novel or the other six movies.  No one ever divided the other movies into two parts, however.  This made the other movies not waste a second whereas in this one the pace is a bit more leisurely.<br /><br />That being said, this otherwise brings the novel faithfully to life.  Harry, Hermione and Ron are on the run as they hunt for the horcruxes to destroy Lord Voldemort.  There is an added wrinkle they learn though when they hear the story of the Deadly Hallows from Luna's father and Hermione.  This added wrinkle is told visually with what may be puppets and is the most visually arresting part of the movie.  Whoever did this sequence did an incredible job.  It is a fabulous piece of art and storytelling.<br /><br />Lord Voldemort as played by Ralph Fienne is absolutely magnificent.  Every time he is onscreen, the story is just wonderful. The makeup and prostheses used on him also recreate the oddly disfigured creature he became when he returned to the world.<br /><br />If the second part is extremely well done, then the two parts, when viewed together, may end up being a 5 star experience.  As it is, one is left a bit unsatisfied at the odd truncation point of this seventh film, a part one rather than a whole film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B003ASLJK4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I read the book years ago and keep reading it over and over.  It is such a touching love story.  I finally had to buy the movie. I highly reccomend this anyone that loves a true love story. Have bought this as a gift for friends as well. The romance in this is thrilling.

0684857219|5.0|If you're an Arnold fan in any capacity, this book is for you.  Plenty of photography and information. This book is huge!   In addition to getting Arnold's take on how to train, it provides an interesting historical perspective on the body building phenomenon.  Well worth the $$$.      Also, hilarious coffee table material that guests couldn't dream of passing up!  haha

B00005LOUP|1.0|How do you stretch a short, children's picture book into live action feature film ? You can't. At least you can't given the evidence of this abortion of a feature film directed by Ron Howard of all people.    What is there to say about the *snicker* Dr. Seuss' *snicker* How the Grinch Stole Christmas and it's plot ? It's the very epitome of how a feature film throws in costumes and special effects to cover the fact that it has so little source material to go with. The film strangely decides to make one incidental character featured in the book and film into the main protagonist, Cindy Lou Who. Remember her great personality in the Seuss book and Chuck Jones' cartoon ? Yeah, me too. The little non-entity is fusterated during Christmas time because she feels that there is something more to the season outside presents and decorations. Yes I know, it sounds like the protagonist in every Christmas tale ever made. The town she lives in is called Who-Ville and I guess it's suppose to be a \\"larger than life\\" location not be found in reality. I will admit this is not reality, it's TV sit-com reality with a bigger budget. Who-ville is nothing more than your common white-suburbia you see on CBS every night in the guise of faux-Seuss. You have the common workman, jealeaous neighbors, etc. .To describe the inhabitants of this community would be a total waste of time.       Now we arrive to The Grinch. Hello Jim Carrey. I see your flailing to earn that pay check once again. The Grinch is suppose to be a legendary horror figure residing near by in a isolated mountain hide away. This \\"Grinch\\" really is nothing more than a comical fop who does nothing but prance around around and yell. I love Jim Carrey but like any other great preformer who ever lived, he NEEDS something to worth with. For some reason lousy writers and, in this case, a great director who is showing a huge lapse of logic, seem to be believe Jim can just bounce around a picture and that qualifies as entertainment. Still, Jim Grinch is given some substance. Grinch was appearantly rejected by the Who-Ville community as a child and escaped to hide in a mountain that is actually like shaped like The Grinch's head and face. Yeah, go fig. If this thing was a character as oppposed to just a bouncing marketing tool, I may have actually felt sorry for him.     Simply put, this is a terrible film that clearly was trying to cash in on the reputation of a classic children's book and cartoon. The costumes and make-up are butt-ugly, there is a mess of special effects to substitute a plot and developed characters, and a avalanche of cliches. Stay away from this film by all means.
B003UYUR10|4.0|I found Prince Of Persia a fun time. A good \\"popcorn movie\\" because it kept my attention with its acting, story, music and cast of characters. Gyllenhaal and Arterton deliver in the action genre and Molina (as usual) steals the show with his quirky role. Worth a try!
B00337KM2S|5.0|This hybrid comedy-drama-romance is a rare treat that honestly addresses job loss, love and relationships without resorting to common cliches or contrived situations. George Clooney and co-star Vera Farmiga are reminiscent of Cary Grant and Deobrah Kerr in An Affair To Remember.     Vera Farmiga is the strong, female co-star Clooney has long needed. She is beautiful, sophisticated and restrained, similar in many aspects to Brigit Bardot and Sophia Loren. She is Ukrainian but was raised in America. However, she did not speak English as a child which probably explains her elegant restraint when speaking English. Men will truly enjoy the brief but wonderful scene of Farmiga naked in Clooney's motel room. Wow, what a hot body.    Clooney is superb as a confident, insensitive but charming employee terminator during the economic collapse of 2008. Clooney works for a corporate consulting company based in Omaha, Nebraska that performs the dirty work for spineless business owners. It is a thriving business during the 2007-2009 recession. This movie was released during late 2009.     Clooney as Ryan Bingham boasts that during the previous year he spent 322 days on the road, flying from city to city in pursuit of victims. But, one day while sitting a hotel bar, he initiates a conversation with Vera Farmiga playing Alex Goran, a fellow road-warrior and corporate shark, equally consumed by frequent flyer perks and privileges. They end up in bed but the traditional, cliche love story never evolves.     The script is superb as is Farmiga who previously appeared in The Departed by Martin Scorsese and the 2004 remake of the Manchurian Candidate. Obviously, she is not an obscure actress but this role was meant for her. She plays her character with incredible charm, grace and sexual vitality telling Clooney \\"Just think of me as yourself with a vagina.\\" Although captivated by Clooney's charm and appearance, Alex always remains his alter-ego much to his dismay.    In the end, Clooney isconsumed by a life free from personal responsiblity and the daily toil of earth-bound inhabitants as he pursues his goal of becoming the seventh person in the world to achieve 10-million frequent flyer miles. I don't know if American Airlines paid a fee to partially sponsor this film but it is a long-form commercial for American Airlines elite frequent flyer awards program which bestows unique privileges to a select group of travellers.    The screenplay by Sheldon Turner and director Jason Reitman was adapted from the 2001 novel by Walter Kirn. It should be studied by screenwriting students at cinema schools because it is a rare example of honestly addressing difficult issues such as job loss and life without love. And, Jason Reitman should be applauded for honestly presenting the devestating effects of economic collapse while simultaneously entertaining us. It is both rare and rewarding to see documentary film seamlessly interwoven in a fictional story. Instead of resorting to token cliches, Reitman gives us real victims expressing their rage and anguish after losing long-time jobs.    This film is a tribute to great writing, acting, directing and producing. It successfully embraces comedy and tragedy and is truly enjoyable to watch.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|This CD is a bit different. It's a bit more Bluegrass. (?)  Great, I love every song! It's just different.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|I put this movie right up there with all of the Christmas Carol movies. It leaves you with a great holiday feeling at the end. It has an older more nostalgic feel about it which is refreshing in this day and age. A must buy in my opinion. You wont be dissapointed.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this on television but really enjoyed watching it all together with no week delay in between.    This movie got here on Christmas eve and I didn't expect to see it until New Years eve.  Thanks Amazon and USPS for getting it here in time  for Christmas.  My husband had very few things on his Christmas list and this was one of them.      I had seen the Band of Brothers and really enjoyed the stories of the soldiers and their hardships and reality of how war is really so hard on these men.    My appreciation for a soldiers as well as their family's sacrifices is now thoroughly entrenched in my memory.    The more stories I hear from soldiers the more I hate war. How it changes them
B000002N2P|4.0|When Green Day exploded with Dookie, it seemed almost flukey. After a decade of being music everyone ignored, their Ramones/Buzzcocks derived power-punk was 10 times platinum, and the expectations for \\"Insomniac\\" were sky high. While the album is pretty good, it follows a near perfect one. \\"Insomniac\\" sounds rushed, and even if the band was already on their fourth album, this sounded like a sophomore slump.<br /><br />The main diferences between \\"Insominiac\\" and \\"Dookie\\" are the arrangements, which aim for a harder rock sound. \\"Brain Stew\\" kicks off with a riff AC/DC would be proud of, and \\"Panic Song\\" revs up an extended introduction that jumps off the short/sharp/shock formula of the earlier punks. Which is something \\"Jaded\\" - at a machine gunned 90 seconds - sticks to. The album's best songs stick to the formula for the most part, and \\"Brain Stew,\\" \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" and \\"Panic Song\\" have become deserved classic radio staples.<br /><br />The band was evolving, and the major change is at the end. \\"Walking Contradiction\\" starts to hint at the intospection that would fully bloom when Nimrod's<br />\\"Good Riddence/Time of Your Life\\" became a major hit. \\"Insomniac\\" could have used a few more of these change ups. The snotty juvenaillia that made \\"Dookie\\" such a suprisingly charming album sounds forced here, and puts \\"Insomnia\\" somewhere in the middle of Green Day's catalog.
031603438X|4.0|Absolutely loved this book. Such a candid account of what life was like for Keith and the Stones 40 years ago. The kind of book you finish and feel like you've just spent hours talking to Richards yourself. Highly recommend.
B001GCUO16|2.0|The Digital Copy code given does not work. I get invalid code error when I tried to do the Digital Transfer on both iTunes and Windows media player.
B004EDH4OY|4.0|I have to preface this review with something... I absolutely love Duffy, like ridiculously. So this review is more about me liking the artist rather than this particular work of hers. I know other reviews have not been kind to Duffy on this album. I have to be honest and say I think she can do much better than this. Evidence - Rockferry (which is one of my top five albums). You have to keep in mind this album is not at all like her first record, if you can get that bias out of your mind when you are listening to this you may be kinder to her. It is definitely an album that takes a few listens to grow on you. My four stars for Endlessly are more for Duffy as an artist than this particular album, but it does grow on you. For me Duffy's voice is best suited for lonely-breakup-rainy day type songs, not to say she can't sing some upbeat songs (like Mercy); but this album just does not seem to fit her like a glove as her first one. I'm all about supporting your favorite artist in new sounds they try; in my opinion this sound did not work for her as well as others she has done. I look forward to her next album (hopefully the wait won't be as long as this one), and here's to hoping it's different than this album. All that to say, there are some great songs on this album - Well, Well, Well, Don't Forsake Me (probably my favorite), and Endlessly. Keep your fingers crossed for the next one.
030726999X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander rises from the bed to avenge her enemies, with help from the usual suspects. A fast-paced ending to the saga.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is in a hospital bed, recovering from being shot in the head, shoulder, and hip. While waiting to be charged with attempted murder, and in all likelihood also facing the prospect of being declared a mental nutcase and locked away for the rest of her life. Which of course, is what the Zalachenko club wants. Blomkvist and co of course are not going to have anything to do with it, and set about trying to uncover the details of this nefarious plot, without having access to Lisbeth Salander, who, of course, is lying in a hospital bed, with no access to any phone, computer, or the internet. Or is she? Berger is off to the Swedish Morning Post as editor-in-chief, where she has her hands full with a tough-to-handle news editor and a possible stalker. Blomkvist's sister is a lawyer, and has the unenviable task of getting Salander to open up to her, which as we all know, is not exactly a walk in the park. The Zalachenko club is not playing fair, of course not, in making sure that evidence is destroyed, witnesses silenced, and testimony prepared to send Salander off to prison. And several other subplots that intertwine to give the reader a rip-rocking thriller.<br /><br />This third book moves at a much faster pace than the second book, and is simply unputdownable. We know the characters, and there are really no new twists introduced here, but this is still one heck of a novel.<br /><br />One can only wonder what exciting fare Stieg Larsson would have dished out had he still been alive.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|One of the best scores for a film, I've seen. It is currently one of the other film score I went out and bought right after seeing the movie, just because it was so memorable. If you are looking for ordinary Daft Punk songs, this is not it. As others have stated, if you are looking for Daft Punk dance music this is not it. You can tell Hans Zimmer and the old Soundtrack has influenced this newer score. That is not to say Daft Punk did try to bring in their own style into the soundtrack because that would be an understatement.
1400079144|3.0|The motion picture industry got the order all wrong.  The first book of what has become (so far) the Robert Langdon Trilogy was Angels and Demons.  That was followed by The DaVinci Code.  The third book of the trilogy is The Lost Symbol.  Tom Hanks as Bob Langdon?  Spot on!  Author Dan Brown, the imaginative mind behind these three sometimes controversial books, has written other novels (Deception Point and Digital Fortress), but neither of these garnered the attention nor raised quite so many eyebrows as the Robert Langdon Symbologist books.<br /><br />Never mind that they all give the same disclaimer, \\"This book is a work of fiction.  Names, characters, businesses, organizations, places, events and incidents are either the product of the author's imagination, or used fictitiously.  Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is entirely coincidental.\\"<br /><br />If you struggle with this disclaimer as have so many who have read Mr. Brown's books, let me spell it out for you.  Here's what it means; here's what he's saying: \\"NONE OF THIS IS REAL.  I MADE IT UP!\\"  If you're still struggling with this, or you still find the meaning unclear, perhaps it's time for you to go back to those Golden Books.  Like Angels and Demons, and The DaVinci Code, Mr. Brown has once again told a rousing good tale.  It is a page turner of the highest order and will keep any reader glued to their chair for a good night's reading, or longer, depending on how fast a reader you are.  But it IS fiction.  Not a word of it is true.<br /><br />Which is a good thing, because Mr. Brown proceeds from two faulty premises throughout all three of the manuscripts.  First, the writer assumes that the Holy Roman Church (the word `catholic': L. catholicus literally means `universal') is representative of the universal worldwide Christian church.  It is not.  Second, writing from the apparent position of an agnostic or perhaps atheistic point of view, the writer first prefers, and then dismisses the spiritual understanding of the very faith and supportive writings (i.e., the Bible), believing that a humanistic intellectual theoretical understanding is preferable.<br /><br />But then, I must remind myself that \\"this book is a work of fiction\\" and nowhere claims to be a theological treatise, nor the writer anything but a clever story teller.<br /><br />In The Lost Symbol, we are reintroduced to Harvard Symbology Professor, Author, Public Speaker, Folk Hero and all around Good Guy, Robert Langdon, whose specialized field of obscure knowledge once again comes to the rescue and saves the world, putting him on the fast track to catch up with another fictional universe savior, James Tiberius Kirk.  This time, Langdon's quest is to decipher the mysterious Freemason's Pyramid, in time to save the girl, rescue his friend, and secure national security.<br /><br />Even though Langdon is an old hand at this, and we know that somehow he'll pull it off without being converted, Brown tosses in a few monkey wrenches that caught this reviewer completely by surprise.  One such wrench so blindsided me that I almost just set the book aside out of displeasure for this `novel' twist.  Instead, more out of stubbornness than anything else, I persevered to the end only to find the clever plot twist un-twisted by an even more clever story device.  Telling you even that much walks the thin line of almost giving you too much information and transforming (key plot related word) this review into a spoiler.<br /><br />If only because Dan Brown needs to move on from the Catholic Church and find someone else to turn into a `work of fiction,' The Lost Symbol gets 3 ½ stars out of 5.hen dismisses the spiritual understanding of the very faith and supportive writings (i.e., the Bible), believing that a humanistic intellectual theoretical understanding is preferable.<br /><br />But then, I must remind myself that \\"this book is a work of fiction\\" and nowhere claims to be a theological treatise, nor the writer anything but a clever story teller.<br /><br />In The Lost Symbol, we are reintroduced to Harvard Symbology Professor, Author, Public Speaker, Folk Hero and all around Good Guy, Robert Langdon, whose specialized field of obscure knowledge once again comes to the rescue and saves the world, putting him on the fast track to catch up with another fictional universe savior, James Tiberius Kirk.

B000BZISTE|3.0|I have always been a fan of the late Robert Altman's work as a director. A couple of his films that have withheld the test of time, Nashville and California Split, come readily to mind. Those slice of life films still \\"speak\\" to the subjects at hand, the glitter of country music stardom and its underside reality and the fight to get rich quick at the gambling tables. No so this film, M.A.S.H., a film that on first viewing I was very impressed with. On a recent re-viewing I found myself distracted most of the time. Not that the film's \\"follies of war\\" theme in a front-line Army medical unit (then the Vietnam War, although the earlier Korean War is the thinly-veiled locale of the film, and not to be confused with the handful of American wars since then) has lost its significance. If anything that theme is more relevant that ever. What has lost power, and punch, is the notion that through the antics, and frankly this thing is filled with antics, that would embarrass even the lowliest \\"frat rat\\", can draw those lessons about the folly of war. Sex, sacrifice, more sex, some off-hand skilled surgery, more hi-jinks and booze, and then off to home (and presumably a soft, country club life) do not make that same impression that first drew me to the film. Even Elliot Gould, who was great, and still is worth seeing, in California Split and as an understated Phillip Marlowe in the film version of Raymond Candler's The Long Good-bye got on my nerves. Enough said.
B004B8K2C8|5.0|This is without a doubt the best new series since Mad Men.  Each episode is a movie of its own, beautifully shot, cleverly written, wonderfully executed. The only complaint possible to level against this one is that there is not nearly enough of it.  I cannot wait for more.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|It was easy to believe I would hate this movie because it was so wildly popular, and I do not like anything that is broadly appealing to middle America, me being an outsider to white middle class rural America, innately, inexorably, in every way.<br /><br />And yes, while the movie wisely omitted nudity and violence, there were some deplorably sappy scenes that I could have done without (deep breathing and moans in the dark - a few minutes too long - yuck - I am fine with just implications that they had had sex).<br /><br />However, the sum total is this: life is mediocre and boring not only in the Midwestern farm country but really anywhere in the world, lots of us are stuck in our dull but completely serviceable work and family lives.  Most of us will die without really being in love and will never know what we missed.  A few lucky (or depending on your view, deeply unlucky) ones will fall in love at middle or old age.<br /><br />And we will not be able to jump ship from our dull lives because we are afraid that the new lover will tire of us soon enough.  Or it won't work.  Or we feel too attached to the familiar and prefer the numbing as opposed to the stimulating.  Or we do not have the financial means to do whatever we want.  Or we love the kid though we do not love the co-parent.<br /><br />This movie captured very well the truly imperfect choices we have in love and life.<br /><br />I think the only happy ending for this couple would have been joint death by suicide or accident.  The real life ending portrayed is all too true: death by long dull regretful life.  A life sentence, not a merciful execution. Only a few of us are blessed to die young or middle aged and beautiful, after an ultimately blissful experience.
030746363X|5.0|I challenge anyone who gave this book less than three stars to do 75 swings with a 45 pound kettle bell. This book is fun to read, practical in real life, and eye opening in places. It's not for everyone.  Alphas wanted, betas need not apply.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is a classic and anyone that has ever \\"worked\\" will appreciate it. It has some familiar faces and some not so familiar ones that give it some interesting combinations..
B003UYV08E|3.0|Almost always sequels, especially action-packed sequels, suffer by comparison with the first production. That is the case here with Iron Man 2. What made the original Iron Man interesting, beyond the finely-tuned performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the \\"frat brat\\", poor little rich boy, Tony Stark, out to find his place in the world, and incidentally act as the sole defensive shield necessary to save the old U.S.A., was the creation of Iron Man and that first struggle against the world's evil metal. IM2 already figured to extend that monster metal notion, although harking back to the old Cold War days with a Russian antagonist (Mickey Rourke, as Ivan Vanko) out to revenge old hurts was a curious twist. Iron Man, naturally, despite a few aging \\"heart\\" problems single-handedly (oops, double-handedly, he has a partner here). The plot left me with this feeling-Ya okay, what of it.             As for the boy meets girl aspect (Downey and his administrative assistant, Paltrow), or I should say \\"boy met girl\\" since they already got kind of moony-eyed in the first picture, an aspect that is always sexually and romantically understated in these comic book-drawn movies (Spider Man, Super Man, etc.) they continue that chaste romance here. What I don't get is why a sensible woman like Downey's \\"Girl Friday\\" would have anything to do with a, well yes, a good-looking guy with a zillion dollars, with some \\"boss\\" fast cars, and with access to all kinds of techno-gadgets. A no-brainer, right?  At least, serious, chaste, \\"kick butt\\" governmental agent Scarlett Johansson didn't fall for all that superficial stuff. And she trashed his performance (not a team player) as well. Smart woman.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this cooler to go with a AMD Phenom II X4 955. Although the stock cooler that comes with that processor is pretty beefy on its own, I intended to overclock the processor so I wanted more cooling headroom. This cooler definitely provides that headroom. Even overclocked to 3.8 from 3.2 at stock voltage, the processor idles at around 35C and only goes up another 10 under full load. At full load, the two 2000rpm fans I have in a push-pull on the 212 stay around 1500rpm. This is with the included thermal paste, no less. For this kind of performance, one could expect to spend double or even triple the price. Cooler Master definitely has a win with this product, one that should be considered by ever budget minded builder and overclocker.     The only issue I could find with the cooler was the installation, which was tricky. I definitely recommend watching the youtube video as a supplement to the included manual before attempting to install the cooler. Cooler Master does earn points back for a revamped fan mounting system, which is now being included with the 212. Although the system is now made out of black plastic, I found the mounting system to be very easy to use and more secure than the old metal clip system.
0316098337|4.0|I don't read much Adult fiction, but my mom handed this to me right after she finished and told me to read it now. I had heard quite a few amazing things about Room and decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did. This book was unlike anything that I have ever read. Room was haunting and stunning, while uplifting and hopeful. It keeps on just coming back to me. I can't imagine being in a room for my whole life and not realizing what I was missing. Jack was the original naive character as possible. He didn't know what was outside his world. I really adored his courage and strength through out the book. Ma also had a lot of strength and I loved how she made up these clever \\"games\\" on ways to get the neighbours to notice this shack. While she seemed selfish, I haven't had to deal with the horrors that she has. It was epically original. Donoghue created a unique and interesting book that I loved. Jack's world was powerful and unique. I recommend that you go buy and read this book now, you won't regret it.
4770031246|5.0|I've been following Makiko's JustBento and JustHungry blogs for a while and this is a great supplement if you love cooking and/or bentos. It was an early Christmas present for myself and it was worth it. The pictures are excellent and the instructions very detailed but not overwhelming. This is a must have for bentoists and cooks and serves as a good basis for experimentation. Use your imagination and happy eating!
B004498KPU|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of the short films.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who is a fan.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Loved this movie.  So action packed it flew by too quickly.  I wish there had been more character development with her husband - but other than that I enjoyed every action packed moment.  Looking forward to a possible sequel.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|The stage, instruments, video,fireworks, light shows, etc. were wonderful, but you can barely hear any of the vocals on this DVD.  On record the vocals on DSOTM jump out at you, on this DVD you can barely make out what they are singing. If you were not a Floyd fan and knew the lyrics, you will be greatly disappointed by the weak vocals on an otherwise wonderful performance.  Who or what the hell happened here? I want to hear David and those sexy backup singers sing the lyrics over the other instruments, not be drowned out by them.  Who can we crucify and blame for this significant problem with the vocals?
B00361DR4Q|4.0|This was the blu-ray disk by which I was going to benchmark my new blu-ray and HDTV set up.  It did not disappoint: the picture was sharp with vibrant colors, and the DTS sound was absolutely fantastic.  However, I also have the 1994 Covent Garden DVD version of this opera with Angela Gheorghiu as Violetta.  I think her voice was better then, and her acting more natural, more passionate, more appropriate to her character.  This new production at La Scala is elaborate and not as spartan, from the stage settings to the supporting cast, but I still like to watch the older version.  It does not have all the niceties of blu-ray picture and sound, but it is a classic which is more pleasant to watch and to listen to.
B00000G3PL|5.0|This is my fiance's and my dad's favorite series. They have all of them memorized. I think my dad should be Danny Glover's character and my fiance is Mel GIbson's character. lol. These are great movies!
B003V52OO6|5.0|I'd never really thought a Will Farrell would become a holiday classic, but [[ASIN:B0002F6BRE Elf]] is a wonderful Christmas treat. The story is simple enough: a human is adopted by Santa's elves, but then returns to New York to find his birth father. As expected, what ensues is one major culture clash. It's absolutely hilarious, with Farrell walking around New York City in an elf costume and getting into all sorts of trouble. My family watches it every Christmas Eve. It certainly beats the usual sappy holiday specials.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|As with the other remasters, the sound quality is distinctly improved on Sgt. Pepper.  It is especially exciting to listen through headphones to hear the mix that they so painstakingly worked on.  The historical notes on the recording as well as the making of the cover give insight into their creative process during this time.
B004BEMC6G|1.0|I'd really like to rate this -3 stars, but 1 star is the lowest I can go.     Zero plot, zero character development. Entirely predictable. The movie is basically 2-3 overly long, boring chase scenes with some dialogue and shoot-em-ups stringing it together. I'm guessing there was maybe a 10 page script for this? I'm really surprised Angelina Jolie went for it. Truly a bad film. She's much better than this, as is Liev Schreiber. I don't think anything could have redeemed the script and overall story. It's simply a bad movie.

B00180R06I|5.0|VAMPYR is an excellent film to watch in between the original NOSFERATU and DRACULA. It's the perfect bridge for the silent and sound age. Watching this movie is a macabre treat, as we are shown images of vampires, spectres, and living shadows that add to the overall dreadfulness (in a good way!) of the story. The atmosphere is thick and foreboding, like a nightmare on celluloid. The character of Allan Gray is iconic, and his \\"ghost walk\\" and \\"coffin-view\\" scenes are incredible! If you love vampires, horror, or just enjoy classic movies, VAMPYR belongs in your collection...
B000002AVF|4.0|Every song on this album is worth the listen. By the way, you won't remember hearing her high-pitched vocals after listening to this CD because they're quite sparsely employed on here. The related lyrics are included in the booklet.<br /><br />\\"Daydream\\" opens up with the catchy upbeat \\"Fantasy\\" that takes you to a beach with its rhythms. The next track, \\"Underneath the Stars,\\" slows down the mood a bit and is what \\"Fourth of July\\" was to the album \\"Butterfly:\\" a noteworthy gem. The former song remininsces on a couple's night. \\"One Sweet Day\\" made history. This duet with Boyz II Men was fantastic although sadly nostalgic. I didn't like the cover of \\"Open Arms\\" that much. \\"Always Be My Baby\\" is an upbeat song that expresses optimism of an everlasting romantic bond despite one's departure (not in terms of dying). \\"I Am Free\\" is a spectacular short ballad that talks about salvation from a miserable past. \\"When I Saw You\\" is another decent ballad of love's enticement. \\"Long Ago\\" is a Hip-Hop sounding song with a nice beat but complains about an ex still existing in mind. Produced by Babyface, \\"Melt Away\\" is an awesome ballad expressing attraction. A very beautiful track, \\"Forever\\" talks about the aftermath of breaking up and it's quite similar to the song \\"Butterfly.\\" \\"Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix)\\" is appealing and of course uptempo. Finally, \\"Looking In\\" is a feminine security song that was okay.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Daydream,\\" but it's not Mariah's opus.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|This is a very beautiful and unique music collection by a one of a kind singer. Like many reviewing this collection, I was taken in by her song \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise it Up)\\". I also saw the video to this song on youtube, and my interest in the song increased even more (the video to this song is definitely worth checking out as well).  I admit that I am still making out the full meaning of the \\"Rabbit Heart\\" song. The best that I can make from the meaning of the song is that the symbolization relates to some type of passionate love affair that she must be emotionally strong about. She gives reference to King Midas (which many know to be about the story of the king who turned everything to gold with his touch). She mentions in the song \\"this is a gift\\", so the meaning of the song most likely implies something positive. There are other gorgeous songs in this collection such as \\"Cosmic Love\\" and \\"You've Got the Love\\" (which is another song that I like). There is also the catchy and energetic \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" (which is a great poppy song). The music to this collection is very original and a great symbol of the eclectic mix of music that is coming out of the current British music scene (as many know the leader singer Florence Welch hails from England). This is a music collection worth checking out if you are open to listening to eclectic music from Europe.
0399536108|1.0|Like many others, I read about this book and had high hopes for learning something new. I waited more than 3 months to get the book from the public library, and sat down immediately to read it when it became available. The book starts off well enough... Chris seems like an interesting guy and is a fairly good writer. But several chapters in, my bulls**t meter was off the scale. This guy's idea of nonconformity is hardly anything new, and I found his ideas to be, for the most part, pointless and ridiculous. Why, for instance, does he think that visiting every country in the world is a worthy goal? I can't see how that makes him a nonconformist (lots of people like to travel), and he certainly isn't contributing anything by doing so. He's also adding a lot of pollution to the air every time he rides that big old jet airliner. I had to laugh at his silly idea of \\"building a small army of remarkable people,\\" a phrase that his followers repeat over and over again (just do a web search). So much for non-conformity. He does present a few good ideas in this book, but as has been noted by other reviewers, none of these ideas are original with Chris and have been presented many times in other books and by better writers. If you REALLY want to live a life of nonconformity and want the step-by-step guide to doing so, start with Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \\"Self-Reliance\\" and chase that with Steve Catlin's \\"Work Less & Play More.\\" Branch out from there.

0064435962|5.0|I bought this book for my preschool class.  They loved listening to the story and then acting it out!  It is fun to watch them choose it from the bookshelf during free time and \\"read it\\" to each other.
B0042MDAL8|4.0|So I got this for my girlfriend she loves this movie, and the whole saga for that matter. So I can't really review it in the sense that you would expect, but I can say that my girl loves it and it made her happy that I got it for her, so on that basis it gets at least a 3 star rating. The more time she watches it, the more time I get to play COD BO, so that's good for another star for a total of 4 stars.
B004498KPU|4.0|Michael Jackson defined music video with \\"Thriller\\", and his short films have been considered leaders of the genre ever since. The most creative, the most innovative, the most audacious, the most expensive. This box set contains all of them, including never before released videos and one last film Michael never had a chance to finish. What else needs to be said?    Even if you own previously released DVDs with MJ short films, this one is worth buying if only for the following gems:  - \\"Once More Chance\\", \\"Say Say Say\\" and prison version of \\"They Don't Care About Us\\";  - ORIGINAL version of the \\"Black or White\\" panther dance - as conceived by Michael, without Nazi graffiti, just pure symbolic dance;  - 16:9 format videos finally made real 16:9, instead of being trapped in a letterbox.    Unfortunately, this DVD-set does not include the full version of \\"Ghosts\\" film, but I'm hoping it will be released separately someday. Being one of Michael's most profound works, it's only available on VCD now. Seriously, how has that happened?!    Also, the quality of old videos is not great, some footage is grainy. It's not worse than on other DVD editions, but I expected picture re-mastering from this one. Obviously, there have been none. Oh, well.

B00110K62U|5.0|first , I've loved this show since PBS showed it  a couple times each holiday season - was that 10 , 12 years ago ?  I think it earns the  badly overused word - great !!    about the lack of multi channel -  I think a lot of ' serious' listeners to music favor old fashioned stereo  ( high Qu. equipment) , and IF this was redone in multi ch it would be 100 % artificial.  do we need bombs and rockets from the rear speakers , all the singers were front & center. as for distortion, depends on the fine adjustment of machine ( espec. VHS for technical reasons) but if the tracking is right, old VHS stereo has fine sound specs , better I think than reel to reel tape. way better than I phone.  certainly they can 'clean up' the sound to CD + standards ,  but multi chan ?? no thanks.    might as well put in my half a cent --  To me all the central characters are spectacular singers. as a creepy old man, I love both Ms Henshall & Ms Salonga , tears in eye every time I watch - and that'd be over 10 times.  I don't get the attacks on Ms Salonga's selection as Eponine , 'not in character' -- Yea, She sings way, WAY  too well ( looks also)  to be an impoverished waif. So ?  are the Inn Keepers a comedy section in the book ? They are very important here and near steal the show.
B00171LFFU|5.0|This re-master is worth the enormous price (if you can even find it now). A great album that sounded awful when first released on CD here, the re-mastered version from Warner Japan is worth all your hard earned pennies. With a night and day difference in sound from an album that is Morrison's best. While there can always be an argument made for extravagance, consider this; how often will you play this particular disc and how much do you like it? The price of admission to an unending performance every time you play it is well, priceless.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|I can honestly say this is one of the worst and most disappointing movies that I have ever seen.  Reynolds performance and the fact that Amazon wont let me put zero stars are the only things saving this from getting zero stars.<br /><br />Taking place entirely in a box is a bad enough idea, but to add on an ending that makes the viewer think \\"Why did I just waste an hour and a half on watching that?\\" to a movie that they knowingly took a chance on watching is just a slap in the face.<br /><br />The film is a fantastic example of what not to do.  Confusing marketing campaign makes the viewer think they are getting something else, then the film itself takes a primordial crap on the viewer.  I knew what I was getting into before I went to see this, I just didn't expect it to be this horrible.<br /><br />1/5, This movie belongs in the bargain bin next to straight to dvd/bluray releases.
1439133948|3.0|The earlier books in the Miles Vorkosigan saga are literally jaw-dropping (except for the pre-Miles starting novel Barrayar, which is fairly good).  You come away in awe.  Poignant as hell and hysterically funny are adjectives that come to mind.  Not so this book.  The saga is now officially on cruise-control, and it pains me to say that.   Robert Jordan (aka James Rigney, Jr., RIP) turned on cruise control for his Wheel Of Time saga (and it took another author to bring the saga back on track - 13 books???), and I'm afraid Ms. Bujold is engaging in this shady practice.  Diplomatic Immunity began the decline, and Cryoburn fizzles out completely.  Please, Ms. Bujold, enough of this pap.  If you can't come up with truly heart-wrenching, funny storylines, end it here.  I hope you can, because the Miles Vorkosigan I came to love went into a coma years ago...
B002VECM6S|5.0|Truly enjoyed this movie.  A heart warming story that reminds us that one person can really make a difference!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Anyone who enjoys historical true stories of triumph can be captivated by this well-done production. The religous aspect of the story is well woven-in, in a way that is not distracting.  The acting, the costumes, the cast, and the pace are all perfect.  The British are brilliant at capturing and getting across different personalities, emotions, and inner motivations that make both the actors and the story believeable and real.    This film is entertaining, educational, edifying, and inspiring; not many films accomplish as much. Amazing Grace is definately worth owning so as to enjoy repeat viewings.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Whether you're a believer (of any kind) or not, DEVIL is just a good story. It opens with a panoramic city view that's filmed upside down. An opening the likes of which I have never seen before and one that works incredibly well to unsettle the viewer and give them almost a sense of \\"vertigo\\" (I couldn't help myself!). You don't really know which side/end you're supposed to be focused on and that is also what makes the film work so well.    Just who are these people and really.... what the hell is going on? It's not supposed to be a horror film, not even necessarily a thriller. But it serves incredibly well as a psychological examination of how people end up responding in situations of crisis. Especially when you don't even really know for sure if it IS a crisis.    I'm going to have to give a nod to Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS because as the passengers begin to die, one-by-one, in front of each other and the security crew and police who are unable to get to them, you can literally make yourself crazy trying to figure out \\"whodunit\\". Which isn't necessarily the point and if you make the point of getting caught up in that particular aspect, you're going to deprive yourself of a LOT of the content... and content (all of it) is what sets this film aside from anything I've seen in a long time.    So, no slashers, no spoilers, no scene-by-scene replays. Just a heartfelt endorsement for a great story about people under pressure that was marketed and distributed in a manner that seemed almost destined to drive away the audience who would most have enjoyed it... People who like a good story about people. Good, evil or somewhere in-between.    You should see it for yourself and decide.    As always,  INMO    ; - )
B002ZCY7SW|2.0|The two stars are not for the quality of the television show, but for the quality of the DVD collection.       I watched season eight and thoroughly enjoyed it as the final chapter (in TV form) of Jack Bauer's story. I eagerly awaited the series' final DVD that I had expected to be chock full of extras, including bloopers from the always serious show and a \\"goodbye\\" from the cast and crew.       However, those features are not to be found on any of these discs.        Sure, there are some cool \\"Scenemakers\\" after each episode and two mini-documentaries about the new CTU and the NYC setting, but nothing substantial as I had hoped. There aren't even any commentaries on selected episodes, which is something that has been featured on each and every DVD since season two (and the season one reissue).        I have done my homework and the selected features I desire seem to be on the [[ASIN:B0044E9JU0 24: The Complete Series]] box set, which is a waste to fans who have purchased the DVDs as they have been released for the last decade. I will not pay $180 for bonus features on the season eight collection which should have been included on the stand-alone DVD.        Sadly, the series has come to an end and so have the DVD collections. It's a shame that FOX attempted to cash-in on the series ending and not give fans what they deserve.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception is one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. It is an astonishing film from one of the most original and innovative film makers of his generation. Early confusion gives way to enough exposition to make the plot 'easy' enough to follow and the film  becomes a hugely enjoyable heist with action taking place in simultaneous nested dreamscapes.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|It's extremely hard to find a quality gay movie, and this one is by far my favorite.  I watched it right after I started coming out to people, so Zach's who coming out experience really hit home with me.  I also appreciated how they never used any labels in the dialog except for one little part.  Zach never actually says, \\"I'm gay.\\"  Everyone just understands.  It was good for me seeing Zach being confused and then finally coming to his own realization of what he wants.  Great film, very well done, you will not be disappointed.
B001BWYTAS|2.0|Less than one hour, this recent documentary has a few interviews with the little people such as fans and locals who recall the 1967 fiasco of Magical Mystery Tour, a Paul creation done in the immediate wake of Brian Epstein's death a month before. There is no actual Beatles music here, just muzak instrumentals of the soundtrack songs. There is a fair amount of cutting room stuff of the group on this fall 1967 jaunt around the south of England, but very little actual soundtrack material, aside from a couple of radio interviews done at the time. Spencer Davis and the guy from the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band reminisce a bit, as does Mike McCartney. Victor Spinetti narrates. Because of licensing, there is no footage or music from the rarely seen film itself, which makes this product of interest to Beatles completists only.
B004BSIJ9Q|1.0|Kanye West has always been overrated.  If you really want to waste your money go ahead.  I myself found Runaway extremely annoying, especially as a sad attempt to make up for his childish antics, and it doesn't reflect more than bad singing and autotuning.
B003Z4Y5EK|5.0|I've had this cd in my player for 2 months straight. I can not get enough!   If you like rythmic grooves, drums and horns, you will like this cd. You do not have to be a serious Doobie Brother fan to enjoy this. They sound as good, if not better, than when I first started to go to their concerts in the early eighties.  If you can see them live, do! You will not be dissappointed.
0307577589|5.0|The late Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's brilliant THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO was originally titled the equivalent of \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" and if the Swedish version was more prosaic, it better captured the overall theme of this superb mystery novel.  The story is highly suspenseful, sometimes complicated, and occasionally gruesome and disgusting.  In short, the author succeeded in creating an entertaining and intelligent novel that is also very, very blunt in its revulsion of misogyny.<br /><br />There are three threads to this first novel in Larsson's Millennium Trilogy.  The first two threads, which become tightly woven together but which never become a single strand, center on the two main characters, the star financial investigative journalist, Mikhael Blomkvist, and the brilliant if anti-social hacker and private investigator, Lisbeth Salander.  The Blomkvist thread, which, to mix a metaphor, serves as bookends to the novel, concerns Blomkvist's attempts to expose a corrupt industrialist named Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m.  The Salander thread stitches together the recurring misogyny motif: unjustly declared insane as a child, Salander had lived in a psychiatric asylum until released as an adult under the legal supervision of a court-appointed guardian.  After her first, benign guardian passes away from a stroke, Salander is assigned to Nils Bjurman, a socially respectable but privately sadistic man who rapes her.  What guides her subsequent actions--and this is another repeating theme in the novel--is something that was taught to her by her first guardian, \\"that every action has its consequences.\\"  The third thread, which makes up the greater part of the material of the novel, is a stunningly well executed murder mystery concerning a prominent family headed by the industrialist Henrik Vanger.<br /><br />To tackle misogyny, Larsson creates in Salander a kind of super-hero.  Most of the principal players in this story are realistically depicted (well, there's the matter of at-the-drop-of-a-hat sex, which we'll get to in a moment).  The character of Blomkvist, for instance, who might well be the journalist author's alter ego, is completely believable--he is naturally drawn.  You want to believe in Salander, too, but you do so like you want to believe in Superman: someone you can trust will bust the bad guys.  Salander knows how to hurt bad men so they don't hurt back.  But as fascinating as she is--her tattoos, piercings, and other emblems of an independent spirit endear you to her--she's almost too good to be true.  Salander's not invincible--she has her own Kryptonite vulnerabilities--but she's hyper-real.  It's to Larsson's credit that the reader buys into her all the same.<br /><br />Perhaps not surprising is that sex plays a prominent role in a book with a misogyny theme.  But it's not all or even predominantly in the context of violence against women.  Neither is it ever in the context of traditional relationships.  Both Blomkvist and Salander engage in numerous trysts, with each other and with others, but always with friends and acquaintances not with committed lovers, per se.  The sex doesn't seem particularly joyful.  What are these frequent sexual episodes?  Do they simply reflect Larsson's version of the world, or do they convey a deeper meaning?  Is it that the world is so painful or mortality so depressing that sex serves as a drug to forget the mundane?  It's not clear.  But with the contrast of sex in different contexts in this novel the question seems to hang in the air.<br /><br />THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a terrific novel.  The fact that it is currently a very popular book (the cover has been ubiquitous in Christmas advertisements) just goes to show that sometimes the public gets it right.  Assuming, of course, that people are reading it.<br /><br />(The audio book version works very well.  Simon Vance does a fine job narrating the story.  His vocalizations of the many Swedish characters are uneven; Dragan Armansky, Salander's boss at Milton Security, for instance, sounds like Count Dracula.  Actually, more like Count Chocula.  Anyway, you get my drift.  For most of the other Swedes Vance assumes various versions of a British or \\"European\\" English accent.  It's not too distracting, though.  Vance's craftsmanship overall is solid.)Milton Security, for instance, sounds like Count Dracula.  Actually, more like Count Chocula.  Anyway, you get my drift.

B00192IV9U|5.0|About halfway through Michael Jackson's first posthumous album, there is an exceptional ballad entitled \\"Best Of Joy.\\" That track is said to be the last thing recorded by MJ, and after a few listens to the track, it is apparent that the man never lost his flair for dynamic singing, mixing in wonderful arrangements and vocal nuances the way nobody ever could.<br /><br />The songs are mostly new, with a few holdovers from the \\"Thriller\\" era, \\"Much Too Soon\\" and \\"Behind The Mask\\" (which are outstanding, by the way). A few of the new tracks have been re-worked over and over again, and you can tell (the Cascio tracks in particular), but this is a small complaint considering the quality of material that is here.<br /><br />Standouts include the Akon collaboration \\"Hold My Hand,\\" the slamming \\"Hollywood Tonight,\\" and \\"Best of Joy.\\" Other songs, such as the 50 Cent collaboration \\"Monster,\\" take hold after a few listens. One redeeming quality of the record is the fact that the focus is not on Michael's personal life and his invasion of privacy (except for \\"Breaking News\\"). For the first time since the \\"Dangerous\\" album, Michael seemed content on doing what he did better than anyone in the history of pop music: make positive music for the world.

B0042JIL2E|4.0|Imelda May's sophomore effort is as solid as her debut, seamlessly mixing rockabilly, swing, Irish folk music, and blues-inspired ballads. Especially noteworthy are the beyond woeful torch song \\"Too Sad to Cry\\" and a smokin' cover of \\"Tainted Love,\\" which Miss May makes her own. What sets May apart from other British sirens, besides having an expressive, playfully sultry voice with great range, is a solid backing band that has worked together for years, giving the music a more genuine sound than any contemporaries who are primarily studio creations. Heartily recommended.

0553381687|4.0|I've never read a lot of fantasy. Bradbury, Burroughs, and Lovecraft as a boy. Vowed never to read Tolkien after a a girl in college wrote me a letter in Elvish. But I was intrigued by the promos for HBO's 2011 miniseries, Game of Thrones, starring Sean Bean, one of my favorite actors. A link to an MTV site (remember when they were a music station), recommended reading A Game of Thrones before the series airs in April. This is an intricate, epic story of political and dynastic ambition, survival against primal elements, and individual honor and savagery. Quite frankly, I'm not sure how HBO will distill this long book (first of a series) into a miniseries - unless they go the I, Claudius route and have it air over about 10 episodes. The only downside is the many, many characters in each of the rival camps. Fortunately, the main characters - and many of the secondary, significant characters, are well drawn, with individual character traits and visual marks that set them apart from others. It's an involving novel, a page turner. It pulls the reader in immediately and keeps you wanting to read more. Looking forward to the second volume of the series.

B003B13QQU|4.0|I loved this album from top to bottom. This is my favorite Goldfrapp album. True it is alot less complex then their other work,but it works well for them. I really enjoyed the Lead Singles Rocket and Alive. Alive's music video was really creative and good as well. The rest of the album seems to flow through pretty smoothly, almost like a nice dj set. This album is a great workout album,espcailly on stairs and cycling. Every track seems to build up steadily. I also like the tongue and cheek aspect that Goldfrapp put in this album. They know the 80's electronic music is corny, but they just wanted to have fun. Overall, this is a fun electronic album!
0439023513|4.0|Collins's writing got significantly better as she completed the trilogy - this book is much better written than the first.  Still aimed at young adults, even seasoned readers will enjoy the story of Katniss.    If you liked Ender's Game, you'll probably like this series, but make sure you read the entire trilogy, don't just do the first one, the character development takes so long, you need to read the three books to get a complete story.
B003T6GVWI|4.0|I was anticipating this release, because Kylie hasn't came out with anything in a while. A lot of Americans were anticipating how the album would do in the U.S. and surprisingly it did pretty well by debuting into the top 20 and having several dance hits. I loved our the first single All the Lovers. It's alot slower, but has a nice pace that speeds up toward the end. Which is pretty good when your using it when working out. Getta Out of My Way seemed alittle cheesy, but it seems to work pretty well for what it's worth. Put your bands up is my favoriate track it reminded me of speaker phone and Calvin's Harris's Not Alone. It was something that is pretty edgy and unique. Aphrodite and too much are also good tracks as well. Kylie really did a great job picking out stuart price as her producer. This is dance music gold! If your a fan of pop music, your gonna love this album!
0439023491|4.0|Don't waste your time on just one of these books - you need to read the entire Hunger Games trilogy ([[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games: Book 1]], [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]], [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]) to get the real story.  Each book leads directly into the next, and frankly you don't get enough character development without reading them all.<br /><br />Written for a young adult reader, adults will also enjoy the story but be somewhat disappointed by the writing style, which isn't very sophisticated.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Blu ray is a quality format for movies!  I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters and had to watch it again as a review before I went and saw part 1 of deathly hallows!
0439023521|4.0|Good story, but the writing is very \\"simple\\" without the rich sophistication of most adult authors.  Sometimes it reads like a decent high school writing project, but unfortunately lacks deep character development or world building, just a simple tale.    Still a good read, and I couldn't stop at just the first book.  You really have to read all three ([[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] is the second book, and [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]] is the third) to get a good, complete story out of this.  You can see how Collins improves over time, and the third book is significantly better than the first.    All in all, recommended, especially if you are a Young Adult who enjoys science fiction!
B003LD9P4K|4.0|Better than I expected. Sound quality is excellent, and as usual Amazon lists the sound as just DTS 5.1 when it is actually HD Master. I always enjoyed ELP's unique style and energy, and if your a fan, unless your a stuck in the mud fan that insists they must sound exactly as they did 40 years ago, I think you will enjoy this. Lake's voice was a little weak in the beginning, but once he got warmed up he did a very respectable job on Lucky Man. Emerson's energy is astounding as well as his keyboarding talents and virtuosity, and Palmer did a very nice drum solo.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this and will continue to enjoy it for many years.

B003BKF696|3.0|Some people never listen to lyrics. I am not one of them. And since I listen I must report that the lyrics on this album are laughable, silly, adolescent. Sure, the guitars are fine, but you really need to be a fan of barely-awake-tongue-dosed-with-Novacaine singing to like this stuff.    Here are a few examples of lyrics. If you like them, you'll like this album. If you don't--well then, there may be hope for you yet.    -Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water    -You say you stayed home alone with the flu / Find out from friends that wasn't true    -I defend my family with my orange umbrella    -You and your sister live in a Lemonworld; I want to sit in and die    -I was afraid I'd eat your brains / 'Cause I'm evil    And the worst part is: the singer repeats these insufferable lyrics over and over and over.

0307454541|5.0|After reading all of Dan Brown's books (Da Vinci Code, etc.), I was searching for something as exciting. A friend recommended The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, so I went on Amazon.com and bought a copy.<br /><br />I found the first 38 pages underwhelming and considered that I had been given a tip that didn't suit me. But then the action picked up and I eagerly looked forward to the twists and turns. Yes, there are a few scenes that really got my pulse racing. You'll know them when you read them.<br /><br />Today I am going to buy the second and third in the trilogy. The person who recommended them to me cautioned me to read them in order -- which I will. (A word tyo the wise.) Unfortunately, the auther died, so it's just these three books. I hope you enjoy them.

0307272702|4.0|This book challenges several popular beliefs and that's upsetting to some people. As with most controversial books, it's being attacked by folks who haven't even read it, and even the reviews are attracting negative comments - again, often by people who haven't read the book or who only read parts of it.<br /><br />Indeed I was a little disturbed to read that our most popular paradigm about calories is probably untrue. Weight gain is not due to the difference between calories consumed and calories expended. As an earlier book said, \\"Calories Don't Count.\\" I even read that book many years ago, but I still believed the \\"experts\\" even after I scrupulously followed a low calorie diet and actually gained weight on it. The calorie theory seems so logical, but Taubes gives it a sound drubbing. And really, other than the elegant math of it, what evidence is there that it works? Sure, once in a while it seems to work for someone but look at all the times it fails. (Sigh!)<br /><br />Taubes presents a smorgasbord of evidence against calorie-counting and fat-restriction. His testimony includes history, descriptions of physiology, and summaries of various studies. He goes into considerable detail about the role of insulin - a bit wearying, but important because so many of us need to understand it anyway, with diabetes being a serious threat to health.<br /><br />Insulin brings us to the insulin-carbohydrate connection. I had read about this before because my doctor said that my A1C levels are a bit high and told me to avoid high-glycemic foods so I checked out some books about the glycemic index and they try to explain what insulin does. I think Taubes writes pretty clearly about insulin considering that it's complicated. His statement that carbohydrates activate the insulin response is not controversial, although some of his other assertions about carbs may be hard to digest.<br /><br />Gary Taubes is a good writer and has produced an impressive body of information in this book. I grew a little impatient because he did not provide solutions or diet advice until the last part of the book. Finally he discussed low-carb diets and gave specifics in the final chapter. If you've already followed Atkins, you'll find this to be similar. Taubes says to eat protein without excluding fat and to consume 2 cups of salad greens daily as well as a cup of other non-starchy veggies. He allows some carbs but admits that the amount varies according to individual tolerance. And although he mentioned glycemic values earlier, he does not differentiate between high and low glycemic carbs in the dietary advice. I suppose that is outside the scope of this book, and perhaps the science on glycemic foods and weight is still being developed. (Personally, I followed a low-glycemic diet and - once again-  gained weight on it.)<br /><br />Please do not attack this book without reading it. Taubes gives very convincing rebuttals to many popular arguments. I almost gave the book five stars so please consider this 4 and a half stars. It deserves a wide audience and serious consideration by nutritionists and all who dispense dietary advice.because he did not provide solutions or diet advice until the last part of the book.

I had to put the book away unfinished as I could not take any more quotes like, \\"The fat of candles burned, great tears of wax spilling onto the sidewalk\\" and other such drivel. This might be my first book that I had to give up and quit reading.

We simply like everything in it. The minions, the little girls, the doctor and even the mother are all so cute. The story is simple, but grand (to steal the moon) with good funny details, in particular the \\"Devil Bank, formerly known as Lehman Brothers\\". I care not about the 3D effect (which I dont have) but as a 40+ a good story is always much more important than the CG effect. In short, a must watch.

When you can get a pair of cheap 3D glass for about $30 and when the player becomes less than $150 and when they sell the TVs for a low price at Big Lots, but now on to the movie. The movie is amazing, not the plot or the acting, but the dancing is just awesome! It's just so much fun to watch. It's one movie than can be watched and lots of fun to watch. Really enjoyable, just as good as I expected. This is the BEST Step Up movie that has released so far. The music is really good too.<br /><br />3D Theatrical:<br />The 3D effects were great! Has to be one of the best 3D effects, I've seen. Yogi Bear is also good in 3D btw. If you didn't seen it in 3D, that was one of the best ways to experince the movie. It actually felt like you were there watching them dance! It was amazing.<br /><br />The 3D Blu-Ray and DVD do NOT contain special effects, only on the 2D Blu-Ray.<br />Digital Copy included.<br /><br />A+<br />Must See.<br /><br />NOTES: Can't wait to see Step Up 4 in 3D.

B000007XUQ|5.0|I have the Carpenters' \\"Singles\\" album and this \\"Christmas Collection\\" is of the same outstanding quality.  Richard is not only a marvelous performer but he is also a uniquely talented composer, arranger and producer.  Of course, Karen is heard at her best and Richard's handling of the acoustics is superb.  I never tire of listening to their performances.  Richard's love for his sister is demonstrably evident in every piece that we hear.  It is Richard's hand at the mastering controls that keeps Karen vocally alive and lovely as ever.  His arrangements spotlight her giftedness. In his own right, Richard is a multitalented musician but he sublimates his own greatness in continuing to bring Karen to those of us who appreciate who she was.  His devotion and affection make them an inseperable duo and this album is a masterpiece in its every detail and in its entirety.  Pleasureable listening any time of the year, the Christmas Collection is especially poignant in the Holiday Season.  Buy it, you'll treasure it.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|The Longshot has a reputation for being one of the best Nerf guns there is. This may be true from a modding standpoint, but to be honest it is over-hyped. Granted, it is a good gun. The scope is adorable, if useless (because darts fall so rapidly, you have to aim far enough above your target that you won't be able to see them through the scope at all), but if you really need a scope to hit something with a Nerf gun you are doing it wrong. The stock is nice and adjustable, but is not removable like the Recon/Raider/Spectre stocks. It stores a clip, and because of the design I think it may be able to store any of the clips. The range of the gun is equal to other clip-system guns, and not as good as revolvers like the Maverick (so it is a sniper rifle only in appearance). I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is actually really accurate, possibly the most accurate Nerf gun (so maybe it would be a viable sniper if modded). It is bolt-action manual so don't expect a high rate of fire at all. The front is a detachable barrel extension with an extra one-shot, pump-action gun, presumably to cover you while you reload the main unit. As with all barrel extensions it actually hurts the range a bit.  While I like this gun, it has some flaws in terms of construction. The bipod is rather hard to fold out, and when deployed you can't put on/take off the barrel attachment. The barrel attachment itself is a problem. Oddly, you have install the trigger by shoving it into a slot. I think this was supposed to be an easy step, but it took me about half an hour to do--it kept falling off or not fitting. The stock is also positioned so that if you store the gun upright with the bipod out, it will put all the weight on any clip you put in the stock, which is at least awkward.  Overall, it is a cool gun, but if you are buying your first clip-system gun you should get the Recon or Alpha-Trooper instead.
1843106698|3.0|This book is packed with well-researched and documented information.  The author is authoratative in his knowledge on the subject of Asperger's Syndrome and lays out information that will help anybody who is willing to take the time to read this book.  I recommend this book with the following caveat: It is heavy, in-depth reading but it is laid out in a style that anyone with a high school education should be able to follow; it is not for the faint of heart yet not written so that only a person with a Phd would be able to comprehend it either; although I suspect there are many doctors who should read this author's works and get their heads out of the pharmaceutical clouds.
B003Y3ZTGA|3.0|Teenage Dream starts out strong. \\"Teenage Dream,\\"\\"TGIF,\\" \\"California Gurls,\\" and \\"Firework\\" pump listeners up. Unfortunately, the rest of the album somewhat drags. While the songs are good, the arrangement fails to capture interest.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I'm not going to give a long drawn out review of each specific song and every little detail of the material, I'm just going to speak my mind and leave it at that. I was first against listening to ANY music that was released by Michael after his death because I felt it was wrong to profit from a dead mans unfinished work. But when I saw this album I just had to have it. My ONLY regret is reading the reviews of the album on this site.<br /><br />The album is GREAT. i love it from beginning to end. I can't say that it would have been a major hit had it been released in the condition that it is in right now, because we all know Michael was a perfectionist and didn't put out anything he didn't feel was pure magic, but it has great songs and i've enjoyed listening to it everyday since I bought it. Now for my regrets. As you will read, many fans don't believe that it is actually Michael singing some of the tracks on the album, and that knowledge...or I should say OPINION kind of taints my listening experience every time i listen to the album. Because although i LOVE the whole album there's now a constant thought in the back of my mind of 'is this really the king singing'<br /><br />The three suspect songs fans are saying aren't Mike sound like him to me. the ONE song that no one is mentioning that i believe might NOT be him is Hollywood Life and that's because his voice does sound so much deeper and different, but that might just be from all the mixing done on the song. I do believe all the songs on the album are him but regardless to what, the song was written by him and it is great.<br /><br />my POINT is. regardless to what the fans are saying about it not being him, about the album being an abomination and all that, is their opinion and not fact. What you should take from my review is this. If you're a Michael Jackson fan and you want to get that last bit of magic from him, buy the album. Don't worry about it being him or someone else singing. at the end of the day he wrote the songs and they are great.ey are great.

1594484775|4.0|I consider myself about the average American Nick Hornby reader.  Discovered him with \\"High Fidelity,\\" loved \\"How to Be Good,\\" never read \\"Fever Pitch,\\" saw the movie of \\"About a Boy\\" and promised myself I'd read the book, didn't like \\"The Long Way Down,\\" heard weird things about \\"Slam\\" and read it then heard great things about \\"Juliet, Naked\\" and after reading it, probably over-praised it to all my friends.  It's just really great, though.  Quirky, funny, unexpected, great characters, really interestingly told and a very fun read.  Hornby is obviously a great writer of males, but here he really nails a female perspective like few male or female authors can and I found myself relating quite a bit to the lead character and her predicaments.  Yes, you do play a little, \\"wow, yeah, that's mainly Dylan, but I think I heard that story in relation to another singer-songwriter,\\" but it just adds to the fun as it's hardly overdone.    Thank goodness for this Nick Hornby.  May long he reign.
B0036TGSIK|3.0|One of the things I liked about the movie Juno was the clever one liners. I doubt anyone really talks that way. I doubt anyone can be that clever all the time but it sounds cool. Easy A is very similar in that respect. I wasn't certain how I would like it due to the fact that it IS a younger person's movie and I'm anything but. But I found myself enjoying the heck out of it. It's funny, thoughtful and clever as all get out. Maybe too clever.    Emma Stone plays Olive, a high school outsider, who, in order to not seem so outsider-ish, lies about having had sex. As word gets out she finds she needs to help all manner of guys ease their personal shortcomings and insecurities by lying about having sex with them. They pay her for her kindness but as the lies get deeper and spread further it ends up effecting many of the people around her in unexpected ways.    As goofy as the premise is here it's still a lot of fun. Emma Stone does a great job as the overly bright and clever Olive. Her overbite fueled speech impediment lends a certain endearing quality to her character. Stan Tucci is his usual great self as her dad and Patricia Clarkson does a good job as her mom. All the other primary characters are played well by their perspective drivers. The production values are good enough, the music is good enough and, at a crisp 92 minutes, it gets in and out before it wares out its welcome.    On the downside is its cleverness. It's a bit \\"too.\\" As much as I like Olive's folks they are just too clever and too understanding and too hip. Even though it was fun to watch, I simply didn't buy it. Also on  the downside was the Lisa Kudrow character. The part wasn't that well written and I still can't shake the Phoebe-ness from her every time I see her. The Malcolm McDowell character is little more than a sketch, and the Thomas Haden Church character is pretty good but also a bit too clever and hip.     That being said, this is still a fun ride. You like the characters you're supposedto like and you love to hate the characters you're supposed to hate. Though it's easy to pigeon-hole this as a teen comedy there's more going on here than that. Not much more perhaps but still a lot of fun.
B000002GFT|5.0|I first heard this fantastic album way back in 1970, when it and Jefferson Airplane's \\"Wooden Ships\\" were my two most favorite records.  I played my vinyl copy of Leige and Lief so many times that I wore it out!  It was the portal through which I learned to love Pentangle,  Steel Eye Span, Planxty, and many other artists.  I remember listening to WMMR's Sunday evening folk music night with fervor.  For American kids, this was the equivalent of John Peel's show.... we stayed up late to sneak listen and then searched out the records  something not all that easy for surburban high school kids in the days before Amazon and Tower Records.  We would go to the   Main Line to hear these great artists perform... amazing experiences brought back to life by this lovely DVD.

B004EJ14V2|5.0|When I first saw commercials for this movie I was not impressed. I feared yet another poorly done teen movie that winds up demeaning girls.  A few friends, whose opinions I trust, mentioned that they really liked the film so I decided to give it a chance and rent it on demand.  I'm so very glad that I did.<br /><br />This is a terrific movie.  The concept is, of course, nothing new but the way that it is handled is.  None of the characters, not even the more obnoxious ones, are two-dimensional.  There are some amazingly realistic moments of true humanity all through out the movie.<br /><br />Olive is sympathetic and funny.  Her family is delightful.  And this movie is one of the most female-positive movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />Terrific movie, I'll be buying the dvd.
B00023BLXK|4.0|A young woman has to move to Havana with her parents and sister on the eve of the Cuban revolution, and there, she meets a charming young man (Diego Luna). She doesn't have much social experience, but she knows she likes this guy better than the son of her dad's boss. She signs up for a dance competition with the Cuban guy, and then comes a romance that you've probably seen in several movies before and after this one.<br /><br />This was a pretty good movie with great dancing, and the story is nice as well. And though I like the music, it didn't really convince me it was from the 1950s. The songs in the background were much like the songs of today. I think the story writers wanted to set the film during the Cuban Revolution era so that it'll add to the drama, but they forgot to set everything else (i.e. the soundtrack) to the same time period. In any case, I didn't believe it was 1957. But it was a great film anyway!

My wife was thrilled when she opened it and has been excited to experience the entire collection. There's no reason to rant and try to be a music critic, every UK release and then some is in this collection, they are music CDs with sound quality you should expect from CDs containing music from an era when vinyl records were pretty much it. If you have ever recorded records onto tapes or listened to actual vinyl, you will know that these CDs are a blessing, and to have all the original covers put onto CD case sized covers and put in a box? Even better, getting it all on iTunes and putting the collection away as a collectors item. Scrutinize all you want, but this set is perfect and well done!!!
1439177783|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much and found it to be an interesting peek into the pressures facing hollywood actresses today. I thought it was well written and easy to follow (I saw an interview where she mentioned that she chose not to use a ghostwriter), and I was pleasantly surprised.  I only gave it 4 stars because the more I read, the more it became obvious to me that it could easily be interpreted by some as a \\"how to\\" guide to weight loss... and perhaps not appropriate for someone already struggling with self esteem issues.
030746363X|1.0|I used to be a fan of the \\"idea\\" of Tim Ferris for the last few years, but eventually my suspicions that he was just an exceptionally bright and adventurous young man with zero responsibiltiies or commitments brought him into focus as naive, impractical, and incredibly unaware of anything but his particular situation (i.e. constant travel or competing to become a world-class tango dancer is not everyone's idea of what to do with a freed-up work week, perhaps it's just all Young Tim can come up with).    This book pretty much hammered the final nail in the coffin for me regarding my loss of belief in this guy.  As many have stated here, there is a ton of contradictory advice given here, a la the monthly magazines like MEN'S HEALTH, which seems to disregard the integrity of what they say one month being contradicted in the next  (ex. in the eating chapter, Tim says almonds are high in calories and really bad for losing weight/ stay away from them, but in the sleep chapter, he mindlessly advises to eat almond butter and 100 calorie tablespoon of flaxseed oil before bedtime to sleep better...). There are hundreds of these contradictions in this book.     Why?  * Because Tim is not writing about a thought-out, tested, comprehensive lifestyle that he claims to have developed. Rather, he is just reporting on a bunch of daring experiments that he and his (still resilient) body can handle.. Not all that different from the JACKASS movies, where similarly hyped-up young guys push themselves to do dangerous stunts for thrill of living on the edge.    Finally, I'm curious if anyone else was a little put-off by the tone of the Sex Orgasm chapter....I'm no prude, but the frankness and the language seemed to come from a completely  different book. Stylistically, it is shocking and crude as compared to what precedes it.... Ironically, up until that chapter - before the above comments had finally gelled into my distaste for the book -  I had been thinking of a few folks (my trainer,my parents, my co-worker) who might get something out of the book.  The second the Orgasm chapter began, I instantly began mentally deleting each person from that list, thinking \\"well, there goes that idea...my 70-year old father would like the ideas of diet and exercise, but the graphic descriptions of the female anatomy? Sorry, it's not about prudishness, it's about poor taste\\"...    It's funny that no editor or publisher advised the otherwise mercenary Tim that the orgasm chapter MIGHT NOT BELONG in it's current style in the same book as the other information... I know it turned me off from recommending this to at least 3 other would-be customers.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|WOW! From the first word till the last sentence Portia has us gripped in a story that we think only Hollywood could write. But it is her own words about her own life about the talons of eating disorders and their unrelenting hold they have on their prey. This is a difficult read but the inspiration you get from each sentence is a motivator for all of us to live the life we are born to live without the opinions of others governing us. She is a mentor to others who fall victim to these disorders. The Epilogue is so poignant and perfect beginning to the life that Portia was meant to live. I am so happy for her and I am grateful to her for writing about this monster and being the heroine who slayed the dragon. Helping others by giving back is the first step to moving forward. Share this book with every young woman in your life who might not just be happy enough with what she sees in the mirror. Help Portia to help other women to see that who they are is just right!

He obviously thinks non-conformity means just not working for the man and being self employed because he goes over and over this fact all throughout the book. Non-conformity is so much more, I am a long haired biker working in a white collar environment for a large insurance company, now that is non-conformity and that is what I thought this book was about.Let me save you some money, dont go to collage, travel around the world and be self employed because basically that is all this book is about which is fine but the title is very misleading. He should have titled it \\"I like to travel, here is my story\\". He is a good writer dont get me wrong but I thought I was buying a book about living life going against the grain and Chris seems to conform to every aspect of life except for he is self employed which by no means makes you an expert on non-conformity. If you would like to speak to an actual expert on the subject then get a hold of me.........
B0048ZJOP0|4.0|It would have been something quite extraordinary if Mariah Carey had managed to produce another Christmas record as amazing as 1994's Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas II You has a different vibe and lacks the overall magic of its predecessor, but it's a wonderful record all its own and features some truly outstanding tracks.  I'm not madly in love with a few of the songs on here, but there is no doubt that this album has earned a spot in my annual rotation of Christmas music.  And I might as well be the one to say it - Mariah still makes that Santa's helper outfit look really good.<br /><br />I must admit that I found the first half of this album somewhat uneven.  Oh Santa! Is a fun and catchy tune which you can't help but compare to Merry Christmas' All I Want For Christmas is You - that's a fight it cannot win, but it's a really nice song that really grows on me more and more each time I hear it.  I did feel tinges of disappointment with the songs O Little Town of Bethlehem and The First Noel, though.  To me, it seemed like Mariah was trying a little too hard on these songs, overdoing her famed vocal acrobatics in particular to the extent that her voice didn't seem wholly natural.  Then, on the jazzy Charlie Brown Christmas, her voice seems noticeably airy.  Don't get me wrong - these are still good songs.  The only track I have a problem with is Here Comes Santa Claus, which is weighted down with a lot of hip hop background noise and a beat that sometimes had me expecting someone to break out with a rendition of Another One Bites the Dust.<br /><br />Once I got to Oh Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus, though, this Christmas album really seemed to come alive.  Mariah's soulful and reverent lyrics are wonderful, but the unexpected addition of a true opera soprano (none other than Mariah's mother, Patricia Carey) ringing out the Hallelujah Chorus makes this the most powerful version of Oh Come All Ye Faithful I've ever heard.  It's a little weird to hear someone singing higher notes than Mariah, but the fusion of these two incredible voices is magical.  The live version of Oh Holy Night (my favorite Christmas song of all) is a true gift from Mariah to the world.  Few singers can truly do this song justice, but Mariah is undeniably among them.  The power just keeps building with One Child, an absolutely beautiful song.  Of all four brand new songs on this album (all co-written by Mariah), the one I think people should really be talking about is this one.  Up next is a new Extra Festive version of All I Want for Christmas Is You (which is still my second favorite secular Christmas song of all time) - this is the very definition of a sure thing.  Mariah still has one Christmas miracle up her sleeve, though.  I always find New Year's to be a depressing holiday, but Mariah strips all traces of melancholy out of Auld Lang Syne to produce a track that even I find infectiously joyous.<br /><br />Every year since 1994, Mariah has helped me get into the Christmas spirit, and I am delighted to now have two musical sources of inspiration to draw upon.

B0017DJ3UW|5.0|Few commercial Christmas albums really appeal to me - too many of them mangle the traditional classics I love, especially the hymns, with all sorts of fancy modern sounds that ring hollow to my ears, and, loving the traditional songs so much, few modern Christmas tunes manage to win me over. Ever since its release, though, Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas CD remains a perennial Christmas favorite of mine. Mariah's vocal talent puts her head and shoulders above every female vocalist out there, and she injects true feeling and spirit into every song she sings. On this album, she combines the new with the old, making this a Christmas CD that almost everyone can love.<br /><br />Like many, I was drawn to this CD after hearing the song All I Want For Christmas Is You; I believe it's the best secular Christmas song since Elvis' Blue Christmas. I had to buy the album for this one song alone, but I was also very anxious to hear what Mariah would do with traditional hymns such as Oh Holy Night - my pick for the greatest Christmas song ever written. Many a soprano shies away from truly hitting the high notes at the end of Oh Holy Night, and given Mariah's vocal range, I felt confident she would do the song justice. I was right, as this is one of the best versions of Oh Holy Night I've ever heard. Mariah's voice is equally angelic on Joy to the World, Hark the Herald Angels Sing, and a properly subdued Silent Night. Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child is a song I was less familiar with, but it makes for a stunning conclusion to an album that does pay real heed to the reason for the season.<br /><br />Besides All I Want For Christmas Is You, Mariah co-wrote two other songs on the album: Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) and Jesus Born on This Day. The latter is an especially beautiful song that expresses the true meaning of Christmas. She also throws in an exceedingly fun version of Santa Claus is Coming to Town (and, thankfully, I can now think of Mariah rather than Bruce Springsteen whenever I hear this song). The perfect complement to All I Want For Christmas Is You, though, is Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).<br /><br />Put it all together and you have a true modern Christmas classic featuring a wonderful mix of religious and secular songs that radiate both the fun as well as the serious aspects of the Christmas season. Anyone who loves Christmas - and Christmas music in particular - really should make this CD an annual part of his/her holiday celebration.r this song).

B000F3T3CS|5.0|I was poleaxed by this production, Ildebrando d'Arcangelo is unctuously splendid as Dulcamara and I found Leo Nucci to be utterly hilarious as Sgt. Belcore, his sashaying intro to Adina had me LOL.  This is the first time I ever heard Rolando Villazon singing, he's fantastic, and Anna Nebtrebko is simply entrancing.  I set about finding other works with these singers and was even more thrilled with Bazajet (cd set) featuring d'Arcangelo and other amazing musicians.  I already had a dvd of Netrebko in Lucia de Lammermoor with my favorite Mariusz Kwiecien (still my favorite opera dvd), but I love this dvd too, WOW, WOW, WOW!!!!  I read that Villazon had originally been scheduled to be Lucia's illicit fiance in that production, I keep wondering how that would have been...<br />The staging and costumes of this production are a visual treat and overall the music is quite delicious, I highly recommend this dvd, I've watched it several times already and I am amazed every time, not only at the consistent quality but because I like it better and better every time I see it!
0385342047|1.0|I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella since \\"Confessions of a shopaholic\\" came out. That being said, she needs to move on to something else. That series is now officially burnt out. Her novel \\"Twenties Girl\\" is much more satisfying.    Beccky's antics are getting tiresome. What in the first book felt fresh and entertaining now feels boring and forced. I guess the fact that Beccky is now married and a mother has a lot to do with it. The plot is predictable, I know it always kind of was but it particularly struck me with that book. If \\"Shopaholic goes to Hollywood\\" is next, I'll definitely skip it.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Award season is in full swing, but Polanski's The Ghost Writer has been forgotten. The film won best director award at the Berlin film Festival way back in February of 2010. Memories are short, but this film creates and maintains a level of suspense as high as Hitchcock once did.  If some people still remain afraid to take a solitary shower, then after this film, viewers will look twice for a black sedan before crossing the street. With a great supporting performance by Pierce Brosnan.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The title does summarize the content.  That does not in any way reduce its value.  The documentary systematically goes through educating us about how the financial meltdown happened, and who were the main participants bringing it about.  No political party is singled out, but instead individuals are identified.  And it will be embarrassing for those named, as it should be, all the way through to our present President.  It is well worth seeing.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is a masterpiece of a Rock documentary, regardless if you like Rush or not. I give this movie a 5 stars without reservations. The extras per se are another movie, so you kind of get like 2 movies in one. The PQ is not HD, because this is almost all archival material, so do not judge this movie for its PQ.<br />The movie tells the story of the Canadian progressive rock band RUSH, one of the best selling bands of all time (I believe they are third only after Beatles and Stones). It is told chronologically by chapters, starting when these guys were in high school, until the Snakes and Arrows tour.<br />This movie shows how influential Rush were (and still are), and how important is to put passion in whatever you do in life, and do whatever your heart tells you, regardless of the fashion, and without an obsession to fit in. A good lesson for the world we live today.<br />Bottomline: masterpiece of a Rock documentary highly recommended to any music fan. A cornerstone for Rush fans.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Don't go into this movie expecting an oscar, go into this movie to have fun and you will love it.  I was fearing that this was going to be like GI Joe and be campy and...well lets just admit it that the GI Joe remake was a huge flaming turd of a movie.  Well this movie was exciting, fun, well acted, well directed, a couple editing issues but otherwise I loved this movie.  It was the perfect action movie, not gory, not stupid, it was a bit unrealistic in some moments but that is an action movie for you.  Every role from the TV show was recast perfectly.  It was awesome seeing the guy who played Wikus from District 9 play Murdock.
0743455967|3.0|I read the first few pages, but lost interest. I'm sure if I concentrated better I would get some great ideas on writing technique.
144176996X|5.0|I highly recommend Quantum to anyone who loves physics, particulary, the period in the history of physics that was dominated by giants such as Bohr, Einstein, Born, Heisenberg, Dirac and other great thinkers. Manit Kumar is a terrific narrator, taking what could be a very dry, pedantic topic and breathing life into it. Much has changed since Einstein and Bohr's time, the foundation laid down by these scientists made it possible to explain phenomenon such as black holes, mesons, quarks, string theory, and more.
B000068OCS|5.0|Saw this film when it came out - with a friend. We came out exhausted, emotionally drained, but could not stop talking about it.  Only one other film has done this, for me - Magnolia. Years later I bought the DVD and CD for my sons - all now in the film industry. It is a standard, a reference point, as well as a focal point. Either you get it, or you don't.  For those that do, it is one of the most powerful films ever made. Mesmerizing every time you consume it, or it consumes you; not sure which it is.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of our favorite shows. The writing is sharp, the actors are par excellence, and the chemistry is the finest of any TV show. Penny (Kaley Cuoco) and Leonard (Johnny Galecki) lead a stellar cast.
030746363X|3.0|The 15 minute orgasm is what got me to buy The 4-Hour Body.  I was not entirely unimpressed with the two chapters \\"The 15 Minute Female Orgasm\\".  There are a lot of useful illustrations and he lays out a fairly straightforward approach that he learned from a couple of his trainers - Nina Hartley and the folks at One Taste.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, most of the ideas in the book may be new to Tim, but not necessarily new, and what he does is to give you a brief summary of what he has learned and where he learned it. Some topics he seems to have researched and experimented with a great deal more than others, sex seems to be one of the areas he has researched less.<br /><br />It's an introduction though, and his enthusiasm is wonderful.  His writing is easy to read and entertaining.  There is some good stuff here like: have a clear beginning and ending to a sensual cycle; and that you can't make someone else come - you can facilitate it, but ultimately its them. Other things are not so clear like why it's important to really get comfortable so you don't get tired while you're \\"doing\\" a woman - he seems to have settled on what even he finds to be an awkward \\"doing\\" position.  He omits to mention that you should use lubricant.<br /><br />There is a lot of confusion about the \\"15 minute\\" part - the book describes 15 minutes to get to orgasm, and many reviewers are confused or disappointed by this.  The sources he mentions (Steve & Vera Bodansky, Lafayette Morehouse, One Taste) explicitly discuss extended duration orgasms (orgasms lasting 15 minutes or an hour or three hours or more). Around the SF bay area,  where Tim lives, there are actual demonstrations of varying length and intensity of female orgasm.<br /><br />Seems clear he is just getting started in this area -  the way he describes it makes it seem like its a procedure you \\"do to a woman.\\" Hard to know what he was taught vs. what he retained. What I've seen from the Lafayette Morehouse folks - who, as Tim says, invented this stuff - is that \\"doing\\" is a ride you both take together, she the wave, you the surfer, two bodies, one orgasm. (the same is true for both genders).<br /><br />It seems like these chapters are an example of Tim's 80/20 rule - here is what he thinks is the 20% that produces 80% of the results.  To me it looks more like what is here is more like 10%, not 20% - there is a lot more available for both parties than what he describes.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said about the entire book, if you want to know more you should check out the people Tim cites. I'm guessing that as Tim's research continues he'll eventually wind up looking at the original source of this information.is stuff - is that \\"doing\\" is a ride you both take together, she the wave, you the surfer, two bodies, one orgasm.

B001JNNDEW|5.0|This movie ranks right up there with some of the best ones especially in the comedy genre. I think folks in the IT industry will relate to it more than anyone else but it is so real one can picture oneself as one of the characters in the movie, hopefully not the stapler dude ;)
0316069485|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, the twists & turns intrigued me, and I hope Connelly explores more of the same subject in his next book. I don't know why so many people were disappointed,as I certainly wasn't--and I do not waste time reading anything that is not well written. One of the 1* critics said it was full of unnecessary profanity, but I don't remember any instances of profanity in the book. I will not dwell on character issues, legal issues or Haller vs Bosch issues. I just thought it was a good read.
B0026OE2NY|1.0|Ugh, how dissapointing was it to watch this. I mean, the photos and flicks were great, but then it's all like ''This is pretty, isn't it? Well guess what, thanks to you, were destroying it.'' Seriously.    I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for the environmentalist movement, but then again movie is called ''Home'', not ''Look at the forest fire you caused''.    If you guys want a REAL look at the environment for the beauty it has, I STRONGLY recommend you have a look at ''Plante Earth'' by BBC, now THERE'S a nice view of the Earth without the lady who seem's to be in depression for the past 6 years narrating it.
0786956291|5.0|I am not reviewing DnD 4.0 vs prior versions, I'm reviewing the red box. I dig it. Comes with enough to set up a few adventures and get you interested. It does not give you a full rule book or full dm guide, but it doesn't say it does. This is a perfect box to get a bunch of new people into the game quickly, which is exactly why I bought it.
B0037AGASG|1.0|Goddammit Biebs, please turn off the garbage disposal, I'm trying to write a review here... oh wait, that's your music?????<br /><br />Look, if you're going to disagree with this review and you can't accept me having a different opinion, stop reading this review right now. You aren't going to change my mind and I wouldn't dream of changing yours.<br /><br />Justin Bieber is everything that's wrong with music today. His songs are generic run-of-the-mill R&B love songs you can find on any Usher CD, and his high-pitched annoying girly voice doesn't help much either. Has it seriously come down to this? That men with girly voices are what gets successful and sells a million records nowadays? If so, sign me up for on the \\"We are eternally damned\\" petition. The crap has officially hit the fan.<br /><br />I'm sure plenty are bound to comment on my review with \\"Yeah but he's successful\\" or \\"Girls love him\\". You don't need to tell me that. I know he's popular. So is fast food, and what do both have in common? They poison your insides and they rot your brain. You have \\"Baby\\" where the title is repeated at lest 823763930373464923204723975027525720572348057023790435829 times, and the vomit inducing \\"Somebody to Love\\", which is a retread of pretty much every song out there. That, and it doesn't help that he has some whiny emo on the particularly hilarious \\"That Should Be Me\\", which tries to be depressing but is so melodramatic and over the top, it makes the \\"OOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\\" part in \\"MacArthur Park\\" sound serious:<br /><br />\\"That should be me,<br />Feelin' your kiss,<br />That should be me,<br />Buyin' you gifts,<br />This is so wrong,<br />I can't go on,<br />Till you believe that,<br />That should be me,<br />Holding your hand,<br />That should be me,<br />Oh I makin you laugh, oh Baby,<br />That should be me\\"<br /><br />Raise your hands if MacArthur Park sounds like a serious song to you now. Don't hesitate. I know it does.<br /><br />Look, I will gleefully admit I don't own this album, nor do I plan on it. I only heard it when I was Christmas shopping in the mall and this was playing over the speaker (don't ask me why I didn't have my iPod with me, I'm wondering that too). However, he is seriously the worst crime in the music industry right now. I'm not worried for humanity though- remember he is a fad: Here today, forgotten tomorrow.<br /><br />Okay.

B002ECJZ76|5.0|Forget the scrooges who criticize the dubbing. This is a great Christmas film. It has the unique flavor that could only come from Finland, Sweden, or Norway. Hollywood could not pull this one off. See the modern Christmas legend through the eyes of another culture.     I have every version of Dickens' Christmas Carol, the ones I love and the ones that are shallow, emotionless imitations. This Finnish movie is as good as the best of any of them. It mixes the best of human nature with the harshest of human life and death realities and produces a version of the Santa legend that will melt the frozen heart of any Winter Warlock.
B003XQG0JI|5.0|I have been a fan of the Corrs since their first release. Sharon has had mercy on all of us Corrs fans and released a beautiful cd. Her playing is flawless and her voice is like an angel. This is a cd you can relax and enjoy over and over again.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Christopher Nolan's \\"Inception\\" is an excellent \\"thinker\\" movie.  Not a thinker movie in the traditional sense (exploring the human condition) but more a thinking movie where you have to pay close attention to what is happening as you try and fit the puzzle pieces together... an exciting mystery, so to speak.  For those of you that have seen Memento, it is that kind of thinking movie... you have to pay very close attention to what is going on... it is very exciting figuring everything out!    The action sequences are overall decent, with a few of them that are very good including the shifting-g/no-g fight scene.. very entertaining.      Overall one of the best movies since The Matrix!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album is amazing. I stumbled across this band either online or on a local radio station and was immediately hooked. I bought the album shortly after and couldn't be happier. They are organic sounding and exude a feeling of performing music because they like to perform, not for any other gain than that.     Well done guys. I hope there is more to come.
B0045EJY90|5.0|I still have an old school rack mounted stereo system with individual components. After the death of my CD player I was looking for a single play CD player. The Teac CD-P650 was my choice due to the USB interface. In addition to great Audio CD playback, this unit adds the dimension of plugging in an MP3 player or a thumb drive and being able to enjoy music from those sources. I am a volunteer DJ for CJAM 99.1 FM and I often use thumb drives to preview new releases. The CD player displays the artist and title from the MP3 source, so I can quickly review new music. Overall the unit was eay to set up and works great!
031603438X|5.0|Keith Richard's honest and straightforward style in this book was incredibly engaging. Getting the inside story of the Stones and his journey directly from him is only part of what made this such an enjoyable read. The guy has had more lives than a cat, and his story includes the highs and lows as you would expect. His perspective on the music itself and his descriptions of the songs and shows vibrate with his love of music and his dedication to it throughout the ups and downs of his personal life. Reading this has allowed me to listen to all the old Stones recordings with fresh ears, and recognizing some of the nuances that Keith shares in his book. His use of 5 strings and the open G tuning are a huge part of what give the Stones their distinctive sound and he relates how he discovered that and developed it in the book.<br /><br />I've always been a huge fan of the Stones but I don't think that's required to get a lot out of Keith Richards' story. For fans this is essential reading but for anyone interested in the history of Rock and Roll and the 60's explosion of music this is a must read as well. There's plenty of inside baseball stuff included on his relationships with other band members, most notably Mick Jagger, and the women in his life. Overall I was impressed with the his directness and found the pages flying by.
B000E5KJES|5.0|Goodfellas is the essential classic mafia movie.  It makes the Godfather trilogy seem like a snoozefest!  You will find yourself quoting Joe Pesci lines such as \\"You find me amusing???\\"!
B002IDH4PQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite rap albums, and it sounds killer on vinyl.  Top 5 albums of the decade, top 20 all time.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Excellent Movie! One of the best I have seen. I purchased this dvd online at an awesome price, and received it in the mail quickly. Overall, I was pleased with both the movie and the service I received on Amazon.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|XX was one of the best albums in 2009. I had read an article about it and marked on my list. Especially am listening to it while I was studying or reading something. This album has to be in archieves!
1932100660|5.0|This is a great book that reviews all sorts of health problems in the USA. If you are someone who is interested in nutrition or even concerned with health challenges, this is a must read.  Actually everyone should read this book so we can become a healthier country, not one burdened by chronic disease. Change your diet and change your life.  Dr. Campbell explains it well, in easy to read format.  Loved this book and am sharing it with everyone!
B00006EXDM|5.0|I never paid much attention to the stones because they were such a commercial act, but via experimentation I tried Exile on Mainstreet and was enlightened. Hot Rocks and Exile truly educated me about the stones. Much more soulful than I ever realized. Still don't care much about their 80's era work, but the early work is well worth the money
B003B02OOG|5.0|This was one the most refreshing reads I've had in quite some time. I am from Mississippi and found these stories true to nature and quite believable. Having read many Grisham novels, I was not sure what to expect from him in this format and genre. I was was pleasantly suprised to find that it was very much a page turner that I struggled to put down. The characters are wonderful, thoughtful, and real. The plots flow perfectly and naturally. I highly recommend anyone to pick this up, expecially if you need something light and quick; I very much doubt you will be disappointed.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Fantastic series!  Matt Smith is off to a great start. He's not David Tennant by any means, but makes the Doctor uniquely his own: full of joy and wonder and great expectation about the future.  Less fatalistic and guilt-ridden. Stephen Moffat's turn as producer is most welcome. The writing is far more consistent than in previous series. Russell T. Davies had moments of genius, but often was bogged down by cheesy characterizations and overly silly villains (Slitheen? Adipose? Oh, please...).  Moreover Series 5 is unique in providing an overarching story that ties the whole of it together, far more than in days past.  Expertly executed! A brilliant continuation. Highly recommended!!!!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I was very disappointed to read they made more than 22 songs , so i personally got all multiple editions through different ways and after a week of listening to all tracks , i felt the order was wrong , i rewatched it on a cam version for the sole purpose of the track list . the end product i have completed with the songs sounds every bit amazing and complements the movie in a correct feel .   1.overture ( not in the movie yet it opens up the orchestra )  2 the grid  ( father and son plays when the flynns talk about the grid yet the song plays for a few seconds so i didnt count it in )  3 the son of flynn  4 encom p1  5 encom p2  6 flynn lives  7 seperate ways by journey , plays in the arcade  8 also sweet dreams are made of these by the eurythmics in the arcade  9 recognizer  10 armory  11 arena  12 round one  13 rinzler  14 reflection  15 the game has changed  16 outlands  17 father and son ( the full song plays)  18 adagio for TRON  19 nocturne  20 outlands p2  21 end of line  22 C.L.U  23 castor  24 derezzed  25 fall  26 sea of simulation  27 rectifier  28 disc wars  29 arrival  30 sunrise prelude  31 TRON legacy (end credits)  32 solar sailor   33 finale (end the score with a finale, might not be in the movie , there is another song at the end yet i didnt catch it.)  34 bonus unreleased track from there fx test , its a good song they composed for the movie yet was only used for the clip
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Excellent video editing, pacing, casting and music perfect for the theme. The whole theater said \\"Whew\\" when this was over and many clapped. Starts like a slow train and ends in a frenzy. The camera work and editing reminds me of Jan Du Bont's talked about work when Speed first came out but this moves way faster, relentless. If you like a lot of action and suspense without blood and violence, very fulfilling action film. Like others said, we never expected this winner. We bought the soundtrack here too, if you like electronic that matches a movie and fast video action, it's great.
B000E6ET1G|5.0|I had been given this album back in 1980 as a recorded cassette.  It brought me back to my teenage years and some great music.  However as cassette tapes did, it wore out.  I am so pleased that this copy will remain with me for a long time with the same great music that fired my enjoyment of '60's one-hit wonders all over again.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|watched this film recently and felt it was decent, but hardly worth the hype. the action was it's selling points and machinary going down, but the film just didn't click with me like that. Angelina Jolie has a strong pressence, however this film felt a step off and never really caught my full attention. it was just aight and i've seen this formula so much.
1410430103|2.0|Oh man, where to start?  As many other reviewers have noted, this story has so many gaping plot holes that if the book were a cup of coffee, I'd have a scalded lap.  But worse than that, way worse, are the glaring \\"Britishisms\\" that occur over and over.  When I read a thriller, my goal is to get lost in the story.  That's impossible when in almost every paragraph I'm jarred back to the reality that I'm just reading a poorly written book.  Every allegedly American character in the story uses words and phrases that no American would ever use.  Mr. Child, Americans don't wander about; we wander around.  We don't fetch things; we get things.  We dont park up our cars; we just park them.  We don't dare say; we think, guess, wager or bet.  We don't enjoy the sexy bits; we enjoy the sexy parts.  We don't leave straightaway; we leave right away.  In a group of 100 of us, there might be one or two annoying people who turn every other statement into a rhetorical question by appending \\"right?\\" to the end of it, but we don't *all* do that, like all of your characters do.  Killing Floor characters all sound exactly alike, i.e. like a bunch of teenagers at the mall (I know, right?) or a bunch of stereotypical Cockney-speaking ruffians down at the docks (roit, guvnuh?).  \\"Dear boys\\" and \\"old chaps\\" would've fit right in.  Plus, in Jack Reacher's world, everything is \\"some kind of\\".  Some kind of a big deal; some kind of a secret; some kind of a motor; some kind of a door; some kind of a crappy book that had me cursing in frustration by page 50 and laughing at its absurdity by page 100.      I gave the book two stars instead of one because the Ramboesque action scenes, where Jack twitches his pinky finger and the bad guys all drop dead (ok, yeah, that's a slight exaggeration) are pretty fun to read.  And if the story had been set in a small town in England, the dialog would've been acceptably realistic, and it would've been easy enough to ignore the implausible plot leaps.    But if you like a little realism in your novels, give this one a pass.  If you hear dialog in your head when you read it, like I do, you'll be repeatedly reminded that these are characters invented by a Brit who doesn't know how Americans speak (the examples above are merely a small representative sampling).  Like Michael Connelly's inability to use contractions in his dialog [\\"I am going to shoot you and there will not be anything you will be able to do about it.\\"] and James Cameron's attempt to pass off an Australian with a badly concealed accent as an American war hero (in the movie, Avatar), this inattention to detail constantly interrupts the story and ruins it for me.  A decent editor would have caught and fixed these mistakes, but maybe red pencils were in short supply back then.  It certainly would've taken several of them (red pencils, that is) to do the job.    I dare say, with all the flaws scattered about in the pages of this book, Lee Child comes across as some kind of a bad author, right?  My advice: Fetch a different book from the shelf straightaway.
B002ZG980U|3.0|saw the film recently, part matrix, part matt damon type role and part tom cruise type role. it felt very well sowed together and i was able to digest it. also it kinda reminded me of something russell crowe would do. it had some god action and well paced.Leonardo dicaprio  did good in this film. it was interesting in places and ordinary in others.
B0042816YK|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released in theaters and I knew at the end of it that I was going to buy it as soon as it got released to video. For me, it will be a movie that I will watch over and over because it reminds me to stay true to what I think are the most important foundations for a successful life. Can't forget to mention also how visually stimulating it is. Loved it!!!
B0037UUZQY|5.0|Other than the hair getting pretty tangled, it is a great barbie for the girls that love the movie tangled.
0307120007|2.0|I've bought this book hoping that it will be helpful at teaching my son about different textures.  I've bought the soft cover bound book and it is very, very flimsy.  It is made cheaply.  The diffent pieces of fabric could be a little bigger for babies' small hands.  It's too much of a hassle to return, otherwise I would have gladly returned it.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|This is a great album...the Kings rock! If you like the Kings of Leon this CD is a must have. If you don't like them, buy it anyway and your mind will change!!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Our family saw this on dvd for the first time while we were on vacation and our twin thirteen-year-old daughters said it was a must-have.  Fun, action-packed, original story, and good acting made it a hit with our family!  Highly recommend!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|The Black Keys is a truly awesome band. Each song on this album has a different feel to it, but the album as a whole meshes so well with a smooth calming effect. Feeling frustrated? Listen to the Keys and mellow out!!
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne practically invented hard rock, and while he may now look slow, clumsy and barely aware in public appearances there is NO TRACE of any of that in his singing on this album. His voice has changed very little since his days with Black Sabbath over forty years ago, and his lyrical skills are as good as they've ever been. Yet he manages to avoid sounding as though this is a mere continuation of 'Diary of a Madman' or anything else; he's more than willing to incorporate new sounds and rhythms into his music, actually making it sound thoroughly modern as well. My only criticism, and a very mild one at that, is that there's no one or two tracks which really jump out and grab me, reach my soul- but they're all really well-written and performed- among the most kick-ass albums of the past several years. Even at full price this was money well spent.
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|I have adored Lenny since school. The image of him, ecstatically conducting the 9th at the fall of the Berlin Wall is imprinted on my mind. This collection is something I just had to have. A lot of the all-time greatest and lots of new composers too
B003ES61EE|2.0|I'll preface this by saying that I've owned cameras for over 60 years, so I've had plenty of experience with fingerprints and dust on lenses. I'll also tell you that I purchased a lipstick-sized badger hair brush for a half-a-buck in 1957 and still carry it with me, so what really interested me in this \\"cleaning system\\" was the chamois which supposedly will take off fingerprints without scratching the lens.<br /><br />Sorry, Amazon (and Nikon), but this was not well thought out. It may be inexpensive, but it's supposed to be a LENS cleaning system, and I certainly wouldn't trust an expensive lens to the chamois and a rather \\"sparse\\" brush! Others may have found a use for it cleaning iPhones and LCDs, but that wasn't the advertised purpose.<br /><br />It comes in a box that's much bigger than necessary, and inside that box was a 20 page limited warranty in five languages. But not one word about the product. Do you wet the 3/8ths inch chamois disc before using (NO!). When it wears out or gets filthy, how do you replace or clean it? I guess this will be one of life's little mysteries.<br /><br />It gets worse. The chamois does not remove fingerprints. \\"Conveniently,\\" I had a fingerprint on my Canon SX10IS, carelessly left from yesterday's shoot. I brushed first, and then used the chamois. Simply put, the fingerprint didn't even smudge though it felt as though the disc was applied with sufficient pressure. And the brush left a couple of bristles behind!<br /><br />I ended up doing what I've been doing for the past 5 years, using a 3 square-inch microfiber cloth from my optometrist (you can get them anywhere including Amazon) which got rid of the smudge quickly and easily. SEE PHOTO. A similar brush - albeit without a cap - is available through Amazon: Giottos Retractable Goat Hair Brush.<br /><br />The chamois on this AmazonBasics, by the way, remains exposed so I wouldn't store this in a camera bag or purse for fear that something will get on the tip and then really scratch a lens.<br /><br />Sorry that I have to disagree with all the other reviews, but other than using it to remove dust from negatives or old slides, I just can't recommend this \\"system.\\"disagree with all the other reviews, but other than using it to remove dust from negatives or old slides, I just can't recommend this \\"system.\\"

B00406UK7S|4.0|This movie is a definite renter!  I watched it on a dull idle day and found it very enjoyable.  If you're in the mood to be entertained for a while without having to think, this movie is a great choice.  It tells the tale of a Roman Army that goes into the realm of Northern Britain where this army proceeds to get it's @$$ handed to it by the Picts.  The bulk of the movie is the struggle of the few survivors to flee back to Roman controlled territory while being chased by a tireless and uncompromising female Pict tracker.  The movie has a surprisingly strong cast for this sort of B-List film.  All in all, violent fun.

B00192IV9U|4.0|I feel the need to title this review that after reading Nick Danger's review of this album. I commented on his review so I'll leave it at that. I WILL say, however that he had good intentions for the most part. Now, on to MY Review, yes?    Overview:    Michael Jackson's first post-mortum album has been riddled with controversy well before it was officially announced. First people were saying Michael Jackson didn't write anything on the album and then people were saying he didn't sing anything on the album. Press releases by The Jackson Family only added to controversy surrounding this album.    As a result, MJ fans have split in two: Those who've decided not to listen to the Album and even boycott Sony (Ebay your Playstation 3 kiddies, Sony made that too!) and those who've decided to buy the album as a tribute to their beloved King of Pop. I bought the entire Album this morning via Zune Marketplace.     After listening to it all day and then reading Nick Danger's Review here's what I've decided.       The Playlist:    Before we go through this track by track, I feel the need to point out I do agree with Nick Danger on one thing: More than half of the album is either a leftover from a past album or a demo that was so incomplete it was processed McDonalds style. I feel safe in saying the 3 collabs included are legit but at the same time, I respect the decision collaborators such as Will.i.Am made to never release their unreleased duets with MJ. It's a good way to avoid the controversy this album and This Is It have gotten.    Even so, I STRONGLY believe one should listen to the entire album at least once so they can decide for themselves. To be fair and give Nick Danger the Benefit of The Doubt (for I do have some reserves myself), the 3 alleged fakes are marked with an Aserisk (*).    1. Hold My Hand (Duet With Akon): 10/10    The lead song and so far the only one with an accompanying Music Video, this is an original. It was originally recorded in 2008 in Las Vegas.Akon went back to the studio and finished it so it can be understood why his voice makes up the majority of the song. Even so, the message was never lost. Post death, it you get the sense Michael is telling his fans worldwide even though he's gone, the dream lives on.    2. Hollywood Tonight: 6/10    I had to do some research (Thank You, Google and RIAA) to find the origins for this one. It was leftover from Invincible and according to The (Michael Jacskon) Estate, MJ decided to work on it in 2007. Considering what the album version of This Is It contained this doesn't really surprise me. The problem is from the very beginning it's obvious the song was only half-done. The entire second verse is missing and there is way too much filler for me to give this anything higher than 6 points.       3. Keep Your Head Up*: 10/10    Here was have the first of the 3 alleged fakes on this album. I've heard famed MJ impersonators Jason Malachi AND James Porte in person. In both instances, I mistook them for MJ but they did say who they were at several points during the show. They both love MJ enough to not dare fill in for him matter how much money is thrown at them knowing they'd be at the top of anyone's list to cover MJ. MJ's Nephew Tarryll explicitly stated via Twitter his uncle stopped working on this years ago.    My opinion is this song was indeed written and performed by Michael Jackson himself. I also stated I've been listening to this album all day. What I didn't mention was I have everything ever released by him. Like HT, the song was only half done so they filled in the blanks. Anyone can tell just from listening to the first 30 seconds of the song. In fact, I can tell you most of the ad libbing was pulled from Smooth Criminal and Will You Be There. Compare them and see for yourself. The only real add was the backup chorus near the end.      4. (I Like) The Way You Love Me: 10/10    I knew what I was about to hear in the first 20 seconds. I rechecked my other copy and went \\"YES! I'd have GLADLY paid $5 for this track alone!\\" This is hands-down vintage Michael. If I had to guess, the era is somewhere between Off The Wall and Thriller though the modernization preserves the original age rather nicely. Had this been released during th original timeline, I've little doubt people would be talking about it now.      5. Monster (Featuring 50 Cent)*: 7/10    The second on the three alleged fakes. Immediately I thought of This Time Around (HIS Story: Past, Present & Future) when I first heard this song. Some people thought it was a fake in one of MJ's now famous collabs with The Notorious B.I.G. Anyone who's worked with MJ will tell you he'll meet you halfway if it sounds good. I think this was an attempt at that in this case but 50 Cent's style overpowers during MJ's parts on the song. 50 Cent himself did mention a few years ago he was working on something with MJ but didn't say anything more than that. While the exact time they worked on this is unclear, the fact that he at least stated he was working with MJ authenticates the song as legit.    As for the song itself, MJ fills out most of it but it's obvious he's building for 50's verse towards the end of the track. Guitar Heroine Orianthi (who famously worked with MJ for This Is It and the We Are The World Remake) does make a cameo appearance, albeit a brief one at the end of the track.      6. Best Of Joy: 10/10    More vintage Michael here. I've heard quite a bit about this song. If you were looking forward to seeing MJ rock This Is It you should, too: This was on the proposed list of songs he was to perform before his sudden and untimely death. The light ballads and pleasant melody harken back to the days of Thriller. Yes, I said THRILLER. Unlike the rest of the Album this song has been vetted by numberous sources as both being 100% legit and completed prior to June 2009.       7. Breaking News*: 6/10    Here was have the 3rd of the alleged fakes according to Nick Danger. Once again, they simply cut and pasted from existing work and used ad lib to fill in the blanks. Unlike the others it's pretty obvious here. Before I go further and unless I missed count somewhere, this is the SIXTH song in which MJ attacks the media for their attacks against him, the previous five being Leave Me Alone, They Don't Really Care About Us, Scream, This Time Around and Privacy.    Let's not also forget MJ HAS used real news bytes in previous tracks (most notably in the song History) so the ones in this shouldn't be anything new. The problem here is it's just so obvious it's filler. Had I not heard some of the tracks before it, I'd have thought this was a demo. I'll give 'em points for trying, though.      8. (I Can't Make It) Another Day (Featuring Lenny Kravitz): 7/10    Another Invincible leftover, this one was apparently leaked in January. Lenny Kravitz wrote the song and did a variation of it with Jay-Z in the past. He must not have been satisfied with it to have remixed it for MICHAEL. I went and sampled the other two versions and IMO they're both better than this one. It just doesn't fit with the rest of the album. It stands out way too much in my opinion but aside from that it's a decient song.      9. Behind The Mask: 4/10    DOES. NOT. FIT. ALBUM. The lack of a bridge it obviously needs is even worse. The sad thing about it is apparently this was one of the songs on the table for THRILLER. There's a reason it wasn't included with the 3 songs added to the 25th Anniversary Album. It wasn't even featured in any of the compilation sets released over the years. Clearly someone didn't know or understand why. I think MJ could've gotten away with putting it on a special album but it definitely doesn't fit here.      10. Much Too Soon: 10/10    Short and sweet. That's the only way to describe it. Instant Classic and Nostalgia factor like She's Out Of My Life, You Are My Life and Human Nature.      Overall: 8/10    UNLIKE Nick Danger I welcome the scrutiny I knowmy review will bring. Unlike those who took it at face value and those who are boycotting it, I can say I'm not ignorant of the controversy surrounding the Album. As I said in my response to Nick's Review, no one ever took into account the possibility MJJ and/or Sony spread the controversy themselves with \\"support\\" from The Jackson Family.     Let's be clear about something: The Jackson Family could've blocked the release of this album if they really wanted to, more so since Catherine Jackson (MJ's Mother) and/or MJ's attorney has to cosign on anything with his name on it Sony (and anyone else) wants to profit from. Sony. Is Not. Stupid.     My Final Thought...    Try the album. You won't die, I assure you. Decide for yourself weather or not at least half the album was written and/or performed by MJ. If you call yourself an MJ Fan I dare say you're duty bound to investigate yourself for the truth. Don't take my word for it.    If You Liked MICHAEL...    Try The Michael Jackson Experience (released on multiple game systems). You are Michael Jackson as you dance to the Choreography of all The Number Ones and then some =D

I own or have owned all of her albums, and none of them feel like a major solid album for me. I like key songs, all singles, and with loud, I actualy hated Only Girl, I bout it for Love The Way You Lie Pt. 2 which is amazing by the way, i like small doses of Eminem and this did it. Its hearing the song from a girls pov and its solid. I also like S&M Whats My name? Fading and Cheers... thats it! i feel she could do better, but its yet to have happened!

B003Y5H4SY|4.0|The Devil IS in the details in \\"Devil\\" directed by John Erick Dowdle (\\"Quarantine\\", \\"The Poughskeepsie Tapes\\")and written by Brian Nelson (\\"30 Days of Night\\") and produced by M. Night Shyalmalan. Shyalmalan who has had a career in free fall after a promising start may have found his niche as a producer/story man (he wrote the story the film is based on)allowing others to complete his vision.<br /><br /> Unlike the last three films that Shyalmalan has done which became unintentional comedies, \\"Devil\\" benefits from the confined space of the elevator that the story takes place in. Inspired by the folktale \\"The Devil's Meeting\\", \\"Devil\\" works because it eschews the heavy handed symbolism and increasingly lame O. Henry (or Rod Serling)like twist endings that Shyalmalan relied on to tell his stories. Perhaps the film benefited from having someone else direct it and write it which might explain why the excesses that have made Shyalmalan's films virtually unwatchable are absent here. The actors should also be praised here for keeping the film believable.<br /><br />The main flaws with the film are a fairly predictable plot but Nelson introduces a subplot involving our detective that keeps us guessing (even if most viewers will figure it all out by the first third of the movie)and a pat, predictable outcome that lacks the flash that I had opened for at the conclusion.<br /><br />Detective Bowden (Chris Messina)pulls duty on what appears to be a suicide but quickly reveals itself to be something much more. As Bowden investigates the suicide he gets called in to a situation where five people (Jenny O'Hara, Caroline Dhavernas, Bokeem Woodbine,Geoffrey Arend and Logan Marshall-Green) are trapped on the express elevator in the high rise where the jumper made her fatal leap from. The security officer (Matt Craven) in charge and his deeply religious co-worker (Jacob Vargas)watch on their security screens as the five trapped in the elevator are attacked by someone or something in the elevator with them.<br /><br />\\"Devil\\" avoids the trappings that caused Shyalmalan's last three films to fail so badly and that's a good thing. If Shyalmalan can continue this trend with the next films in this series (it's part of a trilogy called \\"The Night Chronicles\\" about supernatural occurences in modern urban society) he might be able to break the curse dogging his films.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a detailed image and nice skin textures although I wouldn't call it refernce quality. Audio sounds quite good throughout and since seens happen in darkness with only the audio to spook us, that's a good thing.<br /><br />The special features are meager with three deleted scenes and a 7 minutes of featurettes that is little more than an electronic press kit presentation. It's a pity a little more wasn't provided here--a commentary track from the writer or director would have been welcome.<br /><br />Proving that the Devil IS in the details when it comes to supernatural thrillers, \\"Devil\\" provides us with 80 minutes of entertainment improving on other films that Shyalmalan has been involved with over the past decade. Although the ending and resolution are a bit too pat (a flaw of ALL of the films that Shyalmalan has been involved in), \\"Devil\\" proves that the road to Hell IS paved with BAD intentions for our five passengers trapped in an elevator and the detective trying to save them and that the road bumpier the road, the more entertaining the outcome.\\"Devil\\" avoids the trappings that caused Shyalmalan's last three films to fail so badly and that's a good thing.

B003EI2EH2|4.0|I pre-ordered this book for my kindle and I read it pretty quickly. Ferriss is very easy to read and is an engaging, entertaining writer. I think the main value of this book is not its information but its inspiration. Ferriss includes many anecdotes from various people that support the idea that through very simple concepts you can seemingly magically transform your body to amazing heights. He tries to explain how these ideas are backed by science that often counters the conventional wisdom. For example, instead of training 30 hours a week for years to be a top athlete you can adopt the new principles and achieve even better results in an hour a day for 2 months or something like that.<br /><br />I think a lot of his ideas are good but not necessarily that new and he doesn't succeed in being scientifically rigorous. He does however include a lot of references to various people and technologies so his book could be a good introduction to people who are seeing these ideas for the first time.<br /><br />An underlying theme is that, because of the  new principles, someone who would typically be considered too busy or genetically predestined to be unsuccessful at some activity can now be successful, which is a very motivating idea. This idea is in tune with his previous book, whose idea is that by adopting various principles about efficiency, people who were previously considered too busy, poor, or whatever to go on vacation or learn some random skill can now do it.<br /><br />I think Ferriss is a visionary who wants to see great social change. We have the technology to allow people to have mini-retirements, multiple careers throughout their lifetimes, achieve physical and mental powers previously unimagined or reserved for those who dedicated their entire lives to it, but our society is slow to change and our civilization is still sort of in the era or having 1 job and 1 hobby for 50 years and then retiring. Presenting himself as a driver of change, Ferriss inspires and also builds a cult of personality around himself. Through his writing he comes off as charismatic and cool, but is also a normal guy who, because of his attitude and philosophies, achieves greatness in a variety of areas. Therefore, if we read his books and adopt his attitude and principles, we should also be as cool!<br /><br />An overarching impression I get from his writing, however, is that it's targeted towards single people without children.  I felt this way about the Four Hour Work Week more so than this book, but his emphasis on the individual and the individual's pursuit of awesomeness weirdly carries with it a sense of loneliness. I don't want to get too psychoanalytical here (I can rarely resist getting too psychoanalytical) but it somehow seems like he's driven by a need to prove himself, to keep busy, maybe an unspoken search for love or acceptance? It's weird, and I only mention it because reading this book made me feel both happy and sad, which was unexpected from a book that doesn't have a plot. Anyway I recommended this book to a number of my friends in hopes of increasing the hotness level of my social circle.personality around himself.

B0015ABRE2|4.0|The third season of Showtime's hit series about a serial killer trying to lead a \\"normal\\" life is a bit weaker than season 2, which was in turn a bit weaker than season 1.  Still, Dexter remains one of the most consistently excellent and original series on television and this latest installment is no exception.<br /><br />Season 3 finds Dexter pondering the notion of whether or not it is possible for him to have a true friend--somebody who sees him for who he truly is and even shares his dark desires.  That role is filled by Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits in a superb performance), an ambitious and charismatic assistant district attorney who uncovers Dexter's secret during the investigation into his brother's murder.  Prado is frustrated with a justice system that allows too many criminals to walk free and he is intrigued by Dexter's brand of justice.  The two men enter into a friendship/partnership of sorts despite Dexter's concerns of a butterfly effect.  He fears that he may be creating a monster of his own much in the same way that his foster father molded him, but his desire to feel normal and have someone in his life who truly understands and accepts him wins out.<br /><br />There are, indeed massive repercussions from this alliance.  Dexter puts himself in a position where his secret can be revealed.  Prado attempts to ruin Deborah's career in an attempt to gain leverage.  An innocent life is lost and the emotional impact of this event is devastating to Laguerta who is still reeling from the deat of Sgt. Dokes last season.  Yes, everyone has choices to make and the effects of these choices can be far reaching indeed.  This point is also illustrated in some of this season's other subplots including Deb's relationship with a CI and her partner's hassles with internal affairs.  Every action, no matter how seemingly insignificant can have far reaching impacts.  This does not bode well for Dexter's future which has seemed destined for a bad end since the beginning of this series.<br /><br />Overall, season 3 is a satisfiying viewing experience.  The performances by everyone are excellent.  Hall, as usual is superb in the title role, but Smits is a brilliant casting decision.  He is extremely likeable and persuasive as the A.D.A. with a passion for justice, but when his dark side emerges he transforms into a violent, angry and very dangerous creature and Smits nails every nuance of the performance.  I could have done without the subplots about Camella's bout with cancer and the mercifully brief plot regarding Masuka's attempt to be taken seriously, but those misteps aside, season three is dead on as usual.Overall, season 3 is a satisfiying viewing experience.

B003MC5N28|3.0|I first read this book as a child and reread it for my book club as a companion book to another dystopian book we were reading. The ending is different from what I remembered as a child and I think this is because the ending requires almost another level of disbelief suspension and maybe doesn't fit in for that reason. I remember reading being confused by the ending as a child, reading it several times, and deciding he had died, but this most recent reading reminds me that it was actually the Giver's idea that he escape and he actually succeeds in finding a new community. This is totally different than what I remember and I think it makes less sense but I'm willing to just let it go. I think the main virtue of this book is that it's like a soft core 1984 for children and introduces the darkness of pain and suffering through a book that's not that upsetting or graphic. It brings up a lot of very interesting questions about freedom of choice, sex, the importance of remembering history. I'd recommend it to older kids.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book describes such horrors that I moved beyond the point of, \\"I'm glad this has never happened to me,\\" to, \\"At least her rapist isn't her relative.\\" I would probably never have read this book of my own volition but I read it for my book club. That being said, I read it very quickly and it's easy to see Donoghue is extremely talented. The perspective of the young child is engrossing and believable. I was so disgusted and disturbed by the room that after I felt I knew what was going to happen for the duration of their time in the room I skipped forward like 20 pages until their escape was finally executed.<br /><br />The most interesting part was the perspective of the boy. I felt like everyone else's reactions and emotions were predictable but the child was surprising and touching. His incomprehension of various things such as the reality of the outside world, and then his later desire to return to the room after their escape, were feelings that Donoghue described skillfully, compassionately, and insightfully.<br /><br />My book club revealed to me that this book was based on a true story that is infinitely more horrible than what is described in this book. I don't know how that affects my feelings about this book. I don't know how I feel about having read this book or about finding out about its basis. I do know that I googled implanting a transmitter under my skin so that this event never happens to me. I think I feel lucky that I've never been kidnapped but also scared that I may one day be kidnapped, so it balances out to just confusion.<br /><br />As a work of literature, I'd probably recommend this book because it's unusual and well done. I don't know if I'd recommend it as a feel-good book, although maybe some people find it uplifting and it does carry with it an ultimate message of hope, love, and healing. I think it depends on your ability to not be as freaked out as I was by the events described.
B0043X7WLA|5.0|Sufjan Stevens once again fails to disappoint in this cinematic collection of sonic bliss. To go from quiet acoustic strumming and subtly genius harmonies on an album like \\"Seven Swans\\" to mostly electronic, spacey landscapes on \\"Adz\\" is quite an amazing display of ingenuity and versatility. I absolutely love the track \\"Too Much\\", but every track on this album is so unique and idiosyncratic on to Stevens' songwriting abilities, making it an absolute pleasure to listen to.

Gosh all Rowling created was Diagon Alley... extrapolate that - Rothfuss created a world, a world with currency and languages and legends and songs and subcultures and cities and creatures and professions....    \\"The University\\" makes Hogwarts look like Old Macdonald's Farm    If you have a heart and a spirit somewhere in that corporeal mass, Rothfuss will take you to a real fantasy world, and he'll show it to you from the perspective of its greatest hero, both brilliant and youthful, magical and musical, a loner and a lover.    On top of all that, Patrick Rothfuss is a darn good writer, and an epic storyteller.  It reads like a symphony.    OH and the magic!!!! This is the most wonderfully crafted Magic in the history of storytelling. Sincerely.    I'd tell you to wait until all three come out, so that you don't have to painstakingly wait for the next two books, but there's something exciting about that, like waiting for a wonderful meal to cook.    Read this book.
1861085257|5.0|If you want to learn more about this art, this author does not spare on information.  This is the best clay book and I bought quite a number of them from amazon.  You will not be disappointed, this book is the kind you keep and the kind you share boast about with everyone.
0316017922|3.0|low quality materials used in production - cheap cover. The book was pretty good - another angle on life from Malcolm Gladwell. Dare I say the Tipping Point is better though!!??
B004EJ14V2|2.0|Certain points the movie is clever, and it rightfully tips it hat to far better teen flicks from the 80s.  But, it was mostly a blah fest.  Not horrible, not great--just blah.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. is a MUST SEE documentary!!!  I cried through most of it, enlightened now to the point of changing what I allow myself to eat, still grabbed and angered by the level of abuse the four corporations who control our food supply are poisoning our food supply, oppressing farmers, and, worst of all, SEVERELY ABUSING the animals, ALL the TIME (I haven't eaten Veal for decades because of what they do to them, but it turns out \\"factory farming\\" like that is the NORM now! : ().   These corp's mandate that chickens not see any light, ever, so that the public may never see the abuse imposed on them.  These chickens and pigs, crowded with their siblings and parents, in NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP FASHION, WATCH each of their associates, one by one, be brutally and heartlessly murdered, while they SCREAM BEGGING TO LIVE.  The pigs are killed in one factory at the rate of 2,000 per HOUR--dumped ALIVE into a big bin on top of each other into a bin below, as though they are garbage.  What doesn't kill them in the dump, kills them when a big metal CRUSHER COMES DOWN AND CRUSHES THEM ALL INTO A DEAD MASS (like they demo. automobiles).  The 4 corp's do what they do because a humane fashion wouldn't make them as rich.  They'd rather be rich than not poisoning us, feeding the animals grass, not shooting them with growth hormones etc. It's a life changing outrage that needs to be addressed, STARTING WITH ALL OF US REFUSING TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      SEE THIS DOCUMENTARY, AND I HOPE IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE AS MUCH AS IT HAS CHANGED MINE!    Cassie
0385736002|5.0|I love amazon. They gave me an estimated date that this order and 4 others will arrive AFTER christmas and i was a bit saddened by the thought that i can't give my brother and my parents something on christmas, but with a change of luck, i recieved my package, on the 24! i was really suprised and happy and WILL order from amazon again. thank you amazon, you tend to over dramatize your shipment dates!
B004498KPU|5.0|This item has is all: the cd music is outstanding, the booklet self explains his work and the dvd is crisp, plus the cover is a job well done. Can stop LOVING Michael. This is a purchase that I will never regret. You will LOVE it too.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|If you're looking for a story line there is one, not much of one but it's there.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a film completely driven by testosterone, violence, and explosions then this is the movie for you.  The blu-ray bundle was the same price as the dvd when I bought it and it even came with the dvd and digital copy, not to mention how much better blu-ray is.  Long story short, if you want to watch a little over an hour and a half of manlyness then look no further
044661758X|5.0|Reading a book that bears that name of Michael Connelly means that it is going to be a guaranteed hit, and THE CONCRETE BLONDE is not different. The book takes you back into the mind and life of Deterctive Harry Bosch who has to confront not just his own shortcomings and flaws but try his best and do his job in a way that will make the people of Los Angeles feel safe.<br /><br />This novel takes you down dark alleys and the deep recesses of the characters' minds, allowing you to feel the emotions that are running as wild as a rollercoaster from page to page.<br /><br />I just love it! As someone who wants to be entertained and made to think along the way, I got this and more from CONCRETE BLONDE, and it is guaranteed to leave any Connelly fan the same way.
0385495323|4.0|Very good and well written book that provides some excellent insight into the history of cryptography and cryptanalysis.  The intent of the book as a high-level explanation and evolution of secrecy in communications is spot on.  More technically inclined readers may be a bit disappointed in the lack of depth into the mathematics behind more modern encryption standards (Diffie-Hellman-Merkle or RSA), but the author does provide additional resources for those interested in the details.  The section (diversion as Singh calls it) about deciphering ancient writings and the difference between languages employing phonograms and semagrams (words representing sounds versus fully developed ideas) and the applicability to the \\"art\\" of cryptanalysis was fascinating.  A good read!
B003K025V4|5.0|This is by far her best yet. I am so tired of hearing all the country singers trying to pretend they can sing. The female singers all have the same range with their voices and sound alike. They sing about their poor love lives or my husband or wife left me and took my dog. This album is upbeat and danceable. I hope she continues on this same path and makes more like this one. Don't let the downers make you change your path of music. They all grow up sometime, some faster than others. Alot of it has to do with the way you were raised and what you are surrounded with. Good Luck Miley and keep them coming.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|Already a great movie made longer; the extended scenes helps the story unfold more. If you havent pick up this movie already the extended version was worth the wait.
B003INBOEM|5.0|One of the best martial arts movie i seen in a long time. I hope the other 2 movies make it to Blu-Ray soon to sit beside this amazingly good movie. Donnie Yen is one of the few actors i enjoy watching do martial arts movies.
B000KJT8IG|1.0|This is a terrible product.  The sound does not match up with the way the lips move.  I have sent one back and exchanged for another.  The same thing occurs.  I now have to send it back again.  I purchased a regular one at Wal-mart (not blu-ray)  and there are no issues.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins has presented a mountain of information that effectively deals a death blow to supernatural religion, and it can only be ignored by those too ignorant or closed-minded to accept rational arguments (and those few reviewers here who try to present religion in a pseudorational way are just embarrassing). Instead, they try to attack Dawkin's character, while they glorify men like Moses, Abraham, Lot and Joshua, who between them had sex with their daughters and sisters, offered their daughters for gang rapes, slaughtered hundreds of thousands of 'men, women, babies and beasts of the field' in a more brutal manner than Saddam Hussain and more destructive way than Osama Bin Laden (occasionally saving the virgins for more gang-raping), invaded other people's lands like Hitler, committed genocide like Pol Pot, etc etc. These were some of the most disgraceful, disgusting individuals who ever stepped foot on our planet, and if Dawkins has exposed these sadistic, domineering perverts, then all the better for humanity. Way to go Lot! Get wasted on booze two nights in a row, have sex with both your daughters, and STILL be revered by Christians! I have to admire the man's bottle - 'Teflon Lot', we should call him.<br /><br />Don't be disturbed by all the braindead who insult your name without reading your book Mr Dawkins. These were the same simple-minded folk who refused to accept that the world isn't flat, or the universe doesn't revolve around the earth - and history will laugh at these insults to human intelligence just like we laugh today at flat-earthers like the authors of the bible, with their 'four corners of the earth'. (Seems 'God' never informed those inspired scribes that the earth is a globe!) To all opponents of this book, all I can say is, if you and your kind believed so long that the world is flat and lies at the centre of the universe (even though you've always supposedly been in direct contact with the creator of the universe), and even killed people for denying it, why should we respect (a) your intelligence and (b) any comment you have to make on anything?<br /><br />(Coming soon for all opponents of this book - why Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy aren't real)ng it, why should we respect (a) your intelligence and (b) any comment you have to make on anything?

B0012EM5D8|4.0|This movie is probably fun for kids but also has a message for everyone.  If you change one thing, it affects many things. I kept it rather than giving it as a Christmas present.
B0029XFNA8|1.0|I was thoroughly disappointed with this version.  I never would have expected a Blu-ray of such a classic to be available in full-screen.  I am supplying this commentary for those like me who wouldn't have this expectation.  Just so you are prepared to receive a partial movie, some call this a pan and scan version.
0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss saved the Fantasy genre for me.    I was going to give up on Fantasy.  It seemed like every book was some Lord of the Rings knockoff filled with castles, wizards, elves and all of that Ren-Fair garbage that was cool when you were eight but gets old when you're an adult.  I don't care what Drizzle named his twin scimitars or how whether he has cat-like reflexes.  If the next fantasy book I'd read had been about a hero who was so cool because he could do backflips and hit things with magic swords, I'd have given up on the genre forever.  Then someone handed me a copy of \\"The Name of the Wind\\" and all was forgiven.        This story is not about a hero who is amazing at karate or sword-fighting.  This is a story about a frightened child who's all alone in the world and has to solve problems in order to survive.  In this way, it's more akin to Ender's Game than it ever will be to Tolkeinn or C.S. Lewis.  Fantasy becomes merely a backdrop and not the focus.  While Rothfus builds his fantasy world and fills it with history, myth and culture, the REAL story couldn't have less to do with wizards and castles and knights.  It's no different from our own world.    \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is about an innkeeper named Kvothe who tells his life story in order to clear up the numerous myths and rumors that people tell about him.  Kvothe is no hero: he is a notorious figure and his story is filled with regret and tragedy.  He explains that it will take three days to tell the whole story and get the facts straight, and so \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is Day One of the Kingkiller Chronicles.      Kvothe is a likeable character.  It's not because you would fantasize about being him (as with every other Mary Sue main character in fantasy and sci-fi).  It's because he's someone you may find genuinely inspiring and for whom your heart would break.  He tells a story about how he was orphaned at a young age and had to survive in a large city by himself.  It's a story that could take place in any setting and will always resonate.      Read this book.  It has nothing to do with Dungeons and Dragons or the Lord of the Rings.  It has everything to do with regret and survival, cleverness and problem-solving, and a lonely man telling a story in a bar.
B0048Y9TPG|5.0|I was really excited to hear Mariah's follow up to her first Christmas album. I really enjoyed the original. It felt more traditional, sacred, gospely, and at times kinda melancholy. It really brought tears to my eyes. As opposed to this new Christmas album, it is more festive and modernized and perhaps more commercialized. The people of this new generation will probably enjoy it more than the original, but for people who are older like myself and is more familar with the 90s Mariah, they might find that this album is not up to par to her Christmas cd. I don't really feel the anointing here like I did with the first one. However, this cd is worth buying for if you're feeling the holiday blues and need something to lift up your spirit. I'm still going to rate this cd 5 stars because there are still nicer songs that make up for the not so stellar ones.<br /><br />1. Oh Santa (4.5/5)- this song comes off as a christmas version to Outkast's \\"Hey Ya\\" with the shouting back up singers and funky background. It's supposed to be All I Want For Christmas Is You pt. 2. Lyrically, they are the same and Oh Santa is a cutesy kind of song like the original. As much as I really like this song, All I Want For Christmas Is You will always be #1 in my book.<br /><br />2. O Little Town Of Bethelehem/ Little Drummer Boy (5/5)- I can't understand how she sounded so confident singing songs like these on the first album while on this one it is a completely different story. still, it sounds nicely.<br /><br />3. Christmas Time Is In The Air Again (5/5)- definately the best one on the album!!! it reminds me of the \\"the wind\\". this is the best song she has ever came up in years. the melodies sound so enchanting. i can envision myself  walking through a cold,dark, snowy morning.<br /><br />4. The First Noel/ Born Is The King (4.5/5)- I like how it has an r'n'b touch at the end.<br /><br />5. When christmas Comes (4.5/5)- Mine Again and Fly Like A Bird do come to mind when you listen to this song. it nice that she's going back to her emancipation of mimi days. it sounds very 70s soul.<br /><br />6. Here Comes Santa Claus/ Housetop celebration (4.5/5)- reminds me of Fantasy. it's a a nice song to play at a Christmas party. Others may not find this song to suit their taste if they want something more traditional.<br /><br />7. Charlie Brown Christmas/Christmas Time Is Here (4/5)- i was never really a huge fan of Charlie Brown, but it sounds nice.<br /><br />8. O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus (5/5)- i love the way she sings in this song, Mariah always know how to make a song of her own. And her mother sound beautiful on the hallelujah chorus.<br /><br />9. O Holy Night (5/5)- this song was recorded live 10 yrs ago so that is why her voice sounds so different here.<br /><br />10. One Child (5/5)-it takes me back to Jesus Born On This Day with the children's choir.<br /><br />11. All I Want For Christmas Is You (Extra festive) (5/5)- it's nice that she included this song and did a little touch up for old time fans like myself.<br /><br />12. Auld Lang Syne (4/5)- very ironic how she went from mariah to lady gaga on this one. i bet everyone out there thought her intention was to make it into a ballad. boy...was i wrong, but I think it is appropriate for a New Year's eve celebration.r emancipation of mimi days. it sounds very 70s soul.     6. Here Comes Santa Claus/ Housetop celebration (4.5/5)- reminds me of Fantasy. it's a a nice song to play at a Christmas party. Others may not find this song to suit their taste if they want something more traditional.     7.

0316069884|5.0|I could write an entire book on this book. As an animal rights activist and environmentalist, I thought I knew everything there was to know about the food industry - esp. factory farming. I absolutely did not. This book is eye-opening and makes you go \\"hmm...\\" Everyone should read it -- meat eaters and vegetarians alike (vegans too!). It's the most objective exploration of the industry one can ask for and the truth is... startling.
B000063KM1|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies!! The humor is wicked, Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon's performances and music by Cat Stevens are all outstanding. I've been telling my nephew about this movie for years and now that he's finally seen it, he's another lifetime fan! Not all will find the humor appealling as it is quite dark. If you like this movie, be sure and check out CRIMES OF THE HEART with Sissy Spacek and Dianne Keaton.
B0024FAG1W|2.0|This movie was mildly entertaining.  Very thin on a plot that is barely plausible.  I watched it to see if it would get any better, it didn't.  I watched the whole thing, so it wasn't a complete bomb, just very dated.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have had my Kindle 3G for about one month and have read over 5 books, including \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanna Collins. I could NOT put the book down! Katniss, the main character, has an amazingly strong female lead and shows how in the most undesirable situations she overcomes and becomes the bold, strong, and confident young woman we all desire to see succeed. I am on the second book of the series, Catching Fire, and have briefly put down the Kindle to write this review. This series is a must read for those who enjoy strong female leads, action, emotional roller coasters, and simply a good book.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|THIS IS A OLD MUST SEE/MUST SHARE MOVIE VERY CHARMING, UPLIFTING & IT WILL RENEW YOUR FAITH IN OTHERS. IT IS STILL AS GOOD AS WHEN IT FIRT DEBUTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST SAW IT. IT HAS SOME BRITISH ACCENT THAT REQUIRES HIGHER VOLUME TO HEAR AND DISCERN. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE A BTR JOB TO MAKE THE DIALOG EASIER FOR THE AVG BEAR TO HEAR/UNDERSTAND.
1439163146|1.0|This is moth-eaten Bret Easton Ellis, 3rd rate high-school stuff that wouldn't have been published if the author wasn't a movie star.  The stories are full of adolescent violence and have no beauty, muscle, or point.  Publishing them is an act of unethical self-indulgence on someone's part; everyone who bought this should get a refund!
B00461BQC0|5.0|In my opinion, Come Around Sundown is one of the best albums of 2010.  It has been in heavy rotation around my house since it was released in October.  I think this is a lot different than \\"Only By The Night\\" - it seems to have a more mellow feel to it and the band seems to not be taking themselves too seriously.  KOL is definately one of the best bands out there right now - they have a very original sound which reminds me of old time southern rock like Lynard Skynard.  My favorites on this album are Pyro, Pickup Truck and Back Down South - although it is really hard to pick a favorite because I think all of the songs are just great.  There are very few albums that I can put on and listen to all the way through and this is one of them.  KOL rocks!
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is one of the best Christmas movies ever...The scene where Santa talks to a cute little girl using sign language is beautiful and always brings tears to my eyes.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|This movie is absolutely awesome on blue-ray! You can really appreciate the costumes and the colors more than on DVD.
B004EAQNO4|4.0|Well this devil film was pretty interesting.  Could have been made slightly shorter, or edited, because around three quarters in it started to get a bit slow, but then is sped up again near the end.  Sort of reminded me at the end of the excorcist, with the old dead lady standing up.  I half expected her to fly around inside the elevator.  Nice black eyes too by the way, she had.  Well i guess the devil got angry when the man admitted his sins to everyone on the walkie-talkie, and thereby clensed his sole.  The devil could not take him and therefore left (angry of course). Pretty good drama and suspense. I give it a 4 out of 5.
B001BKG9SA|4.0|Another feather in the cap of one or Rock's greatest all round muicians, composers and performers.  Carries on the tradition of Pink Floyd genre.  Daid shows his talent at playing not just the guitar on the performance.
0525423273|5.0|Even though I hadn't ever heard of this book, I decided to go for it after hearing other YA author (one of my favorites), John Green, praise the book multiple times on several different social networking sites. He said it was one of the best books he has read, and I have to agree: it's pretty darn good!    I'm usually \\"too busy\\" to sit down and read a book front to back in less than a month. I find other things to distract me and find that I have to flip back a few pages just to remember where I've left off because it's been so long. Anna and the French Kiss did NOT let me do that, which I love! I purchased the book and within about 8 hours total, I was finished with it. It's a super fast read, but it's because each chapter ends with something that makes you want to turn the pages and figure out what happens next.    The love between Anna and St. Clair is so real and so emotional that I was really able to bring myself into the book. Each time one of them did or said something stupid, I wanted to scream at them, which proves to me that this was a good book!    If you're looking for a YA romance book, this is definitely a good one. The thing that I really like about this book is how believable and like-able the characters are. Anna is a down to Earth REAL teenager with REAL girl feelings and isn't some made up girl with an unbelievable sense of being a girl who needs saving. She's so easy to relate to because she's so real. St. Clair, likewise, is very real. Of course, he's a gorgeous American guy with an English accent who grew up in Paris, but that doesn't mean that there has to be a love at first sight fairy tale. Instead, Stephanie Perkins makes it more life-like, and allows the reader to slowly fall in love with St. Clair just as Anna does, which is what a good book is all about.    I hope that this book is a fair indication of future novels that Stephanie Perkins will write. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next! And the amazing part of it all is thatthis was a debut novel, and to top it off, the story began during National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) which is an amazing feat in itself!    This is definitely one I would recommend to anyone who likes YA fiction, and definitely one that I'll read again. Thanks to Stephanie Perkins, for writing such an excellent novel, and thanks to John Green for supporting it and promoting it like you have. Because of you, several people who may not have found this one otherwise (like myself) now have a great book to add to their collection.
B000000WGL|4.0|Heard songs from this album on the radio when it was released 20+ years ago, but bought it in 11/10.  Very good blues songs.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|The 2 female leads are so entertaining.  I enjoyed both the acting and dialogue.  I watched this as video on demand and discovered that the pop-up screen ran smoothly, -- much better than the one within the amazon window which stalled several times.
006085412X|5.0|I bought this book for my son when I was pregnant with my second child.  He was only going to be 17 months when his brother was born and I was concerned as to how he would take it.  He loved this book and I think it really helped prepare him for the transition.  I love that it is a large board book-no torn pages, very durable.  I gave this to a friend who was expecting but will be purchasing it again for my sons when I have my third child next year.
B0015AARJI|5.0|When you first pick up this controller it feels heavy and sort of awkward compared to the normal Sixaxis controller (Sixaxis doesn't vibrate). But once you get in the game it responses quicker and the vibration is sort of entertaining. For instance I play the game M.A.G (massive action game), my surround sound system and the vibration the remote gives off as mortars strike around me adds the thrill to the game. The Duelshock 3 adds a great experience to the game and takes your game to the next level. This is a must buy for all gamers on the Playstation 3 who are looking for a better gaming experience.
0307266303|5.0|This is one of those books you dont want to put down, but it is so good you dont want to read it all at once either. It is an inspiring book for those who enjoy running or think they might enjoy running, but there is much more. History, diet, drugs, exploitation of people and markets, are but just a few of the secondary themes artfully woven around the main story line. I learned about this book from an interview Mr. McDougall did on Imus. I have to say this one worked out much better than the Griftopia recommendation.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I must start off by saying that this is my all tme favorite book. The characters and plot are masterfully crafted by Zusak, leaving readers begging for more. It was so easy to become enveloped that I have found myself reading it over and over. It is just spectacular.
0783225857|5.0|I read the book over 20 years ago but saw this movie for the first time only a few years ago.  It is an excellent adaptation of Harper Lee's book.  Gregory Peck IS Atticus Finch.  A lawyer in a small Southern town, he's approached after dark to represent a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Although in that time and place a trial would just be a formality, Atticus Finch (played impeccibly by Gregory Peck) agrees to represent the defendant.  As a sub-plot, Finch's children amuse themselves in the pre-television era.  There are the endearing interactions between Atticus and his children.  In a dinner-time conversation, Atticus explains that when he got a shotgun as a child, he was told he could shoot any bird but that it was a sin to kill a mockingbird (and thereby explains the title of the book).  Harper Lee portrays small town life during the depression with great detail and the movie brings this out.  Any remake of the film would be simply superfluous.
0060254920|5.0|This is a book everyone should have it in the house. Although it is a book for children, the grown-ups should all know it, so they would remember how it is to be pure at heart and how beautiful the imagination is.

B004EKCNMA|1.0|This is a truly disappointing DVD. The writers left out a lot of dialogue for visual effects. They were more interested in created a visual version that is full of action. Much of the action has nothing to do with the storyline.The scenes are dark, hard to watch, and change very rapidly. The characters are cartoonish, poorly created and for CGI creations do not have much humanlike action.  If I had previewed this DVD, I would NOT have purchased it. I even waited for the Blue ray version before making my purchase. I am sending this to my grandchildren. I am sure they will enjoy it more than I do. Best advice: Try to watch it before you buy it. If you like it fine. I didn't.
0143118420|5.0|I never bought at amazon.com, it's my first time and i satisfy with the service, not only is easy to buy, is easy to complete the required information. I recommend you this service, is good!
B00005JNJV|4.0|Reminds me of the first edition Batman Comics which I think I read in 1938. If not - that's close. Christian Bales is very good as a sometimes bumbling, sometimes over wrought emotional character out to revenge his parents' untimely deaths. Learning how to be a caped crusader and implementing the many tools on his belt to do battle against evil was something that should have been revealed in other Batman feature films. Michael Caine plays Alfred very well. I first saw this movie on TCM or AMC. Liked it well enough to add to my DVD collection.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Despite a few setbacks at the end of the book where you are simply wanting to read the conclusion of this story, It was everything I thought it would be in more. A highly detailed, highly suspenseful, and jaw-dropping book that leads to you really appreciate the characters and the developments throughout the story. Parts of the ending will have you drop the book, take a deep breath as you realize the effects of what has happened, and then have you pick it back up to finish reading the great ending to these kids terrible living nightmare. Perhaps the most suspenseful and endearing story I've ever read. The feeling as the end of the story, as the final pages start to slip through your fingers, you find yourself wanting something more for the characters, you'll know what I mean when it comes. King truly delivered a masterpiece.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Don't read this unless you want to see the English language get raped and slaughtered by Stephanie Meyer. This is by far the worst series I have ever read in my life.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Okay, I've let Black Swan sink in for about half a day now before writing my review, which needed to be done. The more I think back on it, the better it becomes. Yes, this is an art-house type of film and like the other movies from director, Darren Aronofsky, it has no problem strolling into some very weird territory. The Wrestler is the most mainstream we have gotten from Aronofsky so far and it was my favorite movie of his until today. I know Requiem for a Dream has a lot of fans and I admire the it, though watching it is close to torture because it's just that realistic and disturbing, but Black Swan is head and shoulders above everything I have seen so far this year, save for Inception.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional all around. Everybody just fits into place perfectly. Natalie Portman is flat out jaw dropping as the obsessive and uptight Nina. Not only is her acting better than any other actress I've seen in a long time, but her physical transformation is just as astonishing. Dropping 20 pounds off an already small frame and doing 90% of the dancing is no small feat. She better get an Oscar! Mila Kunis is also good in a smaller than expected role as her rival. Portman's Nina is cold and childish, while Kunis brings sensuality and seductiveness to her part. Vincent Cassel, Barabara Hershey and Winona Ryder make up the rest of the strong supporting cast.<br /><br />Other than the acting, the cinematography and music elevate what would normally be rather boring scenes into something unique and interesting.<br /><br />If you are anything like I was when I first heard about Black Swan and the ballet setting, you'll be missing out on the thriller/horror elements that turn this thing dark and messy. Sure the ballet is a major part of the film, but there are many other layers.<br /><br />Black Swan has regained my faith in modern cinema. It's so nice to have an original filmmaker with new ideas in the age of something as awful as Little Fockers. I'm looking forward to see what he has up his sleeve for us next.leeve for us next.
B003YBNREI|5.0|Just buy this album, listen, and listen again.... it's magical, absolutely brilliant music.    It's one of those albums that make you with for an hour long trip just to have an excuse to play it in your car.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|I cannot believe I sat through this waiting for it to get better.  I guess you spell 'stupid' S-P-L-I-C-E.  Save your money.  If you have to watch it -warning- there is a rape scene.  What was the purpose?
B000784WMW|4.0|I have seen several versions of Jane Eyre and this is the best one (IMO) because of Timothy Dalton. His portrayal of Mr. Rochester was intense and strong. Passionate one minute and cool and distant the next. Open, deceiving, manipulative, tragic, defiant and yes, sexy. I loved him. Zelah Clarke, on the other hand, was the worse Jane Eyre. Sorry, her performance didn't move me at all. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite literary characters but I found Ms. Clarke's interpretation to be wooden at times and had too modern a feel to it. Her 'pregnant pauses' go on for years, with a blank stare to boot. I felt no deep passion, no fire beneath the ice. If I didn't know better (which I don't) I would say perhaps the editing was at fault somehow...but probably not. It's just her method of acting. I know many will disagree but, oh well. It's still worth a buy, if for nothing else than to watch Timothy Dalton's performance.
B003ZPCYKG|1.0|I was intending on reading this book on a drive during the Thanksgiving holiday but it never arrived so I wound up watching the movie. I've been told that the book is better (aren't they always) but the movie put me off so I won't try to read the book.  I just couldn't find a connection with the main character. Perhaps the book draws the reader more into the characters desperation at not knowing where she fits in in the world but in the movie she came off as just lost and kind of whiney.
B001B23E9U|5.0|Buier Beware! My granddaughter hinted she wanted \\"Ballet Shoes\\" the movie for X-Mas. I looked on Amazon and found one site offering a single, new DVD of Ballet Shoes for $5.10 +S&H, then I found this site offering 3-DVDs of Ballet Shoes for $37.50 (now $44.08) and scrolling down the details, it read [FORMAT: Box Set] My thought was that there must be a trimmed version, and a longer version (as sometimes happens with made for TV movies for example.) So I purchased the 3-DVD \\"Box Set\\" and gave it to her today (Christmas Morning) and on closer examination, the whole family agreed that these were three identical copies of the same movie. I was silently outraged and embarrassed. I wanted to send them back for a refund, but my granddaughter was so excited about the gift that she tore open one of the sealed containers so we could all watch it together. I decided to let her give the other two copies to two of her friends.<br />  I returned to this site after that and looked more carefully and found further down on the page, it said [Product Description: Includes 3 Units of: Ballet Slippers (KOC-DV-6545)] but why does it say (FORMAT:Box Set)? I realize I should have read all the information more carefully, but I can't help feeling somewhat deceivede by this seller, and there was no such mention of my 3-DVD dilemma in the reviews I read. I have never encountered any site selling multiple copies of the same movie, and I have purchesed hundreds of DVDs through Amazon. Great movie, bad seller!
0199267170|5.0|I got this book for my daughter for christmas she loves it very easy to read and great value for money
B00005NSWI|5.0|Get Happy could well be the alternate title of this album. This CD is lots of fun from beginning to end. These three true masters of the bass, provide an unforgettable recording. I recommend that you use a nice headset to avoid noise from sorroundings, and fully concentrate on this wonderful recording.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I listened to the previews and thought, wow this is different from his usual style but Josh Groban has done it again. I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she likes it. \\"Love Only Knows\\" is one of my favorite and I can't wait to hear all of it in the car with my mom. If you gave this low ratings and booed Josh for being brave and trying something new, shame on you for not understanding how risky that can be in the music business and how an artist like Josh Groban can do it so well.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I foumd this book enjoyable. I wouldn't say it's the best book im the series but still a good read.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|All i have to say is wow!!!! great movie, good special features, the extended cut puts a whole new prespective on the movie, i really wished that was the theatrical version, Ben Affleck had a good preformance but not as good as jeremy renner or john hamm, Great film!!!! HEAT+ THE DEPARTED= THE TOWN
0439882826|5.0|After spending months on my son's wish list, he finally received it for his 4th birthday in October. My son LOVES the graphics and the the clever design. He's young, but having a Star Wars-centric dad with decade old collectibles, he understands how to handle things gently. The book is made pretty sturdy and the pages/pop ups have yet to been ripped or destroyed. The best part is that when you close the book, the pop-ups actually CLOSE with it. I cannot begin to explain my frustration with kids books (I'm talking to you Baby Einstein) with pop up pages that won't close back without force once opened! This book is NOT one of them. And the best part is the price! Only twenty bucks and some change for such a great book is a killer deal. Definitely saw it at a pricey bookstore for $42. Save the money and get it on Amazon.<br /><br />No doubt your Star Wars fan of any age will really enjoy this book. Both my boys, 4 and 36 love it!
B004498KPU|5.0|This DVD is perfect - picture, sound, everything.  I am really enjoying it.  Well worth the money.  Have already recommended it to friends. The man definitely had talent.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was recommended this book and read the sample first to be sure it was a keeper. It hooked me SO fast and I read almost the whole thing in a day. It is heart warming, funny, sad, and an amazing story of a man and his family through the eyes of his dog. The little things you know a dog does, the author does a great job explaining through the thoughts and mind of a dog. The man is a race car driver who is trying to balance his life and his work, while the dog is taking note and being aware of all the different emotions and situations running through the family. So enjoyable to read and really makes you want to go buy a puppy when you are done! I have never written a review before, so if that means anything, this book was one of the best that I have ever read!
B0000CDJPQ|1.0|I thought the fit of this adapter was a little strange to begin with, but since it worked I went ahead and used it. It pooped out after 2-3 months, confirming my original intuition. Suggest you spend the money and buy a short or long cable instead.
B002ZG981E|2.0|Hollywood has an idea, and it wants to plant it in your mind.      The movie's initial special effects (turning Paris upside down) lead you to believe the whole movie will score high on the WOW factor, but the 2nd half of the flick is just a good-guys-vs-the-bad-guys shoot-'em-up, played out in different locales and in different layers of dream.    Like all Hollywood lowbrow flicks (which is to say, like every Hollywood movie), the bad guys shoot millions of bullets but hit only one of the good guys.  The good guys take better aim and kill off dozens of the bad guys.  This is such a tired and unrealistic idea.    Nonetheless, many movie goers rate this as an exciting product.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|This is a good movie to watch if you enjoy history (reminded me of the way the show Tudors is done) and want to see some fantastic acting. Don't expect many chuckles until the middle. If you're looking for the actual robbing the rich story then you're out of luck as this is literally a movie about Robin's life BEFORE the forest.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />*Acting- From the children and extras to the A-list actors, all who had a role in this film were superb.<br />*History- It wasn't a movie where they just dressed the part and spoke with silly accents. It's obvious when watching that they tried to remain as faithful to history as they could in all areas of clothing, scenery, language, dates, etc.<br />*Tone- This wasn't a Disney portrayal. I half expected Robin to be lighthearted, mischievous, and arrogant running around stealing from the wealthy and living a grand life in the forest. This version had a dark and dreary tone which matched the mood and events of the time.<br />*Action- They made Robin and the other archers good at what they did while still being human (unlike the fancy tricks performed by Legolas in Lord of the Rings).<br /><br />Things I did not like:<br />*Action- The version I watched was the director's cut so perhaps it was longer than the theatrical version? In any case the beach scene in the end was just too long. By the time all the soldiers were united you already knew they would outnumber and win over the french.<br />*The Beginning- Again, maybe it has something to do with being the director's cut but the first hour was a complete drag. I was so bored and I kept saying to myself \\"why did I waste my money on this movie.\\" I was literally about to turn it off but Robin reached Nottingham and the movie FINALLY became good. I nearly missed out on a great movie because of the drawn out boring first hour.
1439181780|5.0|I have been living my life the way of the secret, for 13 years now long before the book came out, The Power for me is just reafirming every thing that I have applied to my life and all that has happened to me in the last 13 years, it is all due to the power which I was already using,Rhonda's books The Secret & The Power have explained HOW what I have already been doing and believe in work, I have changed my whole life using the principles of the secret and The Power, its nice to see that there is a law of attraction out there and we do attract what we want to us,My family and friends are all amazed at the life I have now!  If you take on board those principles and apply them to your life, all your tomorrows will be so amazing!
B003SI9WYG|3.0|I never watched the movie as a kid (released when I was 5) and have always heard that I missed out on a great classic. So it wasn't until this Christmas rental deal that I decided to watch it. The beginning to middle was enjoyable. The songs were catchy and simple. The townspeople were all different, quirky, and fun. It wasn't until I finished the movie that I felt \\"that's it?\\" The plot and decisions of the characters were not at all what I thought or expected which is great for not being predictable but it left me with an \\"oh\\" feeling. For example when Jack was trying to figure out the meaning Christmas, he has the townspeople prepare gifts for Christmas Town and not his own. Or when he botches Christmas he decides he is a Pumpkin King through and through and decides to stick with what he's good at. I just wasn't expecting the \\"stick to your day job\\" message. The only change in the people of Halloween Town was their discovery of the wonders of snow. They still didn't understand Christmas. If I'm watching a movie I want to see the protagonist grow a lot more than Jack did. But oh well, that's just me. I know there are millions of people who love this movie dearly (points to the number of 4 and 5 star reviews) but I find the movie to be slightly lacking but still interesting and worth watching for the bits of entertainment it did bring.
B00003CX8N|4.0|Thank you Amazon! Enjoyable, with the actors that I favour, they are excellent at their craft these are the movies I can watch several times over and still enjoy.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Normally I would be happy that more people are reading, but this whole series gives writers a bad name. How are there people out there that can continue to rave about these books when they are clearly the most awful examples of prose to come out of a printing press?
B0044XV3R8|5.0|this 3 disc collection of Avatar is a must have for all fans. this movie is great i'm glad that i did not buy the single disc. this 3 disc edition is awesome. this movie takes special effects to a whole new level. this movie is great
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Sherlock Holmes adventures are rich and wonderful. Even better, with the kindle's built in dictionary it is easy to look up words that have become quite dated.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am not a Star Trek fan, and very seldom watch the sci-fi category, but after weeks of hearing fantastic reviews of this movie I gave it a shot...and it surpassed my expecations. You don't need any previous knowledge of the shows/movies to enjoy this movie, which I was a little weary of beforehand. I'm a big fan of JJ Abrams; from LOST to Cloverfield, I think he's one of the best directors (along with Chris Nolan - the new Batmans and Inception) we have right now and has a very bright future.    The cast is great - having \\"unknowns\\"/smaller actors play Capt Kirk and Spock I thought was a great idea, and the side characters were great and gave great comic relief. I couldn't tell that the main villian (a Romulan named Nero) was Eric Bana until after the movie, but he did a good job as well.    I don't review movies often, but if you're on the edge about buying this movie just do it.
B003AYBD7W|5.0|HERE is a excellent remaster on Gold disc. The pure flat Response of the cd brings you closer to the real master. This is a true way to get to the original sound. This is one of Styx best CDs yet. Great sale price on disc makes it a sure gift this holiday season.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Hands down the best film of 2010, probably the best film of the decade.  Ballet... has never been one of my interests.  About the only thing I know about dance is that these performers are under enormous physical and mental stress and it is an art which deserves the highest of our respect.  Don't let the fact that you're not a ballet fan stop you from seeing this movie.    It was a wild roller-coaster ride of paranoia and terror.  The movie starts us off with an uneasy feeling as we are immediately swept into the life of this dancer through her eyes.  We feel the stress and the polite smiles of people we do not trust.  The film takes some wicked turns which left me lost and scrambling to figure out which cliff I was just tossed from.  Never once did the ride slow down as my brain scrambled to re-sort the details of what I was seeing.    Further and further we plunge into madness and very uncomfortable imagery as the plot tosses us left and right, faster and faster, then leaves us in a smoldering heap of rubble as we crash to stop.  We were left speechless and exhausted.  There is no spoon feeding, patronizing, or hand holding in this film.  It's fast, furious, sometimes erotic, and uncomfortable to watch as you plunge through a dark tunnel on a wicked ride of madness.    Enjoy it.
1440503257|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I am extremely skeptical of cookbooks.  If I can't see reviews on how tasty the finished product is, I have a problem making it.  That being said, this book's recipes are fantastic.  I made Kreacher's French Onion Soup and Mrs. Weasley's meat pie last night, and they turned out wonderfully. The cookbook's full of interesting little facts about each British dish as well as tying all of the recipes back to a single mention in the series.  I would highly recommend this book for any Potter fan who loves to cook!
0698400852|5.0|A Christmas Carol is one of my all time favorite books and I read it every Christmas. This year I thought it was time that I upgraded from the old paperbacks I had and got a really nice version of the story. I bought this one based off the reviews on here and I must say it exceeded all my expectations.    Everyone knows the story so I'll just talk a little about the book itself. The first thing you'll notice is the size and weight of the book. This thing is heavy. Always the sign of a quality book, the pages are thick and of the highest quality and the covers are thick and sturdy. Its a rare thing in this day and age to come across such a well made book. Its the sort of book that looks great on a book shelf or coffee table but will also hold up to many years of reading.    The second thing I need to mention is the illustrations. Sprinkled throughout the book are many illustrations by Robert Ingpen recreating key moments and they are, quite simply, beautiful. Robert Ingpen has captured Charles Dickens' Victorian England and the characters and mood of a Christmas Carol perfectly.     I cant recommend this book highly enough (and I'm picky when it comes to these things), its the sort of book that could become a treasured family heirloom and be read for many years to come. If you've come across this review looking for a high quality version of this beloved story, you can stop looking. I highly doubt that theres a better version available. And the price seems insanely cheap for a book like this.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|One of the most charming and funniest films in recent years.  for lovers of whimsy of all ages.  Poop on realism, relax and go with the flow and hoot with delight.  Be prepared to fall in love with this cast of characters...you deserve something that feels this good!
B001L51RQE|5.0|Although I've been a rabid Amazon shopper for ten years, I've never bothered nor have I been moved to write a review-until now.  Both the concert and the documentary are extremely moving, both in terms of the band's stunning musical virtuosity and the time-mocking brilliance and originality of their songwriting.  The Police just plain embarrass most music acts present and past.  And although I'd love another studio album, you'll see in the concert footage that the old songs have become living entities of their own, and are so loaded into people's lives and consciousness through generations and across cultures that only groups like the Beatles can compare. I'm extremely bummed out that I missed this tour, but the DVD/CD pack almost makes up for it.  Don't hesitate even if you have all the Police albums. This is musical manna.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|Elevators just became scary, because being trapped in one is mind blowing. This movie puts the terror in being traped in a elevator with strangers in place. Each person feels that the other person is going to hurt them.<br /> So watch this to see if they make it out of this prison.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|If you liked Band of Brothers you will most likely enjoy this. There is alot more character development here in the Pacific. Alot of action for the Action junkies out there. Very well written. Saw it wice on HBO and recieved it today for Christmas.
1588167461|4.0|I have been a subscriber to Esquire magazine for a long time now.  I'd like to think it defines my taste in fashion.  It is usually classic and tasteful as opposed to GQ.  When Esquire says something I ascribe to it strong credibility.<br /><br />This handbook is really great.  Witty enough not to be outlandish.  I have browsed other other books on the same topic and they seem geared toward camp in their writing and content.  As it is a handbook, its not supposed to be read like other book e.i. in linear fashion.  If you study this and make your own notes like it was a textbook then you may be deranged.  One thing this book is not is a shopping guide, I do admire that they take a stand on what is great by highlighting it.  While no handbook of style will please me exactly, I would have loved to see content I was not looking for but very interested in.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Brilliant story, great character development, intense plot, great acting and intriguing concept.  It's a film worth watching over again.
B002ZG994U|3.0|As a stand alone movie, it's great.  You will not find in this movie what you enjoyed most from the series.

B002M2N9JI|5.0|Wasn't sure who or what La Roux was until I checked out VH-I(video hits #1) online regarding music videos. First saw video to \\"bulletptoof\\" and heard the song. i thought of the mid- late 1980's which I grew up in.   Looked online for more of her music videos. Found \\"in for the kill\\" and \\"quicksand\\" which were fun and quarky. Unfortunately, Amazon didn't allow for song samples to be heard.   Took a gamble as I ordered a copy of cd for myself. You have to listen to whole thing in one setting plus more. Takes me back to the days of Pet Shop Boys, Erasure, Information Society and a hint of Annie Lennox on speed.   I've listened to this cd every week since I purchased my first copy almost seven weeks ago. Its very high energy, tech and synch-pop combo all wrapped up into one amazing \\"trip\\".    If you are a golden child of the 1980's, you'll groove to this one. If not a lover of the 1980's, you may skip this one. Waiting for their follow-up in 2011???? Love it!!!!
B004498KPU|4.0|ALMOST all Michael's music videos are in here. Full version of Ghost video isn't available. Well if your a MJ fan and wanna own your own copy of MJ's videos, this is a good compilation. (finally I have a clear copy of \\"they don't really care about us - prison version\\")
B004132I20|5.0|Having been blessed - or cursed by sharing the same last name as the great consulting detective; I have had my share of ribbing and leg-pulling I can tell you.  I like the films and television dramas about our Sherlock as much as anybody else.  When I say \\"our\\" I am not necessarily referring to him being an Englishman alone as he seems to belong to the whole wide world.  Having done my share of foreign travel, and having to endure the usual passport checks; I am never disappointed by the expectation being denied of the immigration officers' eyes flicker in amusement when they see my name printed therein.  Therefore, I think I have as much right as any other fan of Sherlock's to express my own opinions of the way the great man has been caricatured on the screen.  For starters: I didn't like the Jeremy Brett interpretation very much.  In every dramatic part that actor ever played, he was just - Jeremy Brett!  A Western wasn't a Western without John Wayne or Randolph Scott.  The names of the characters they played might have differed, but they were only playing themselves in cowboy boots after all.  I suppose we all have our ideal Holmes: Mine own particular favourite was the late Ian Richardson.  He did an excellent version of \\"Baskervilles\\" that I had in my DVD collection until I lent it out and never got it back.  So now we come to this bang up-to-date, \\"Sherlock\\" from the BBC.  Not being much of an enthusiast for contemporary drama I watched the first episode expecting to be distracted after the first ten minutes or so and be tempted to pick up the evening newspaper instead.  \\"A Study in Pink\\" does take a while to get going but I found myself being rather charmed by the performances of the two leading actors, and their interpretations of the modern Holmes and Watson.  I had never heard of Benedict Cumberbatch before this first broadcast either.  Setting the series in contemporary London was a master-stroke of genius in my humble opinion. It all worked brilliantly.The total absence of Deer-stalker hats and Meershaum pipes and Sherlock's magnifying glass, Hansom Cabs and a typically bumbling Dr.Watson, have been done to death in the past; and not missed by me.  Here we see a brand new Sherlock for the twenty-first century. With his friend and colleague, John Watson, solving crimes with all the modern electronic gadgets and gismos at his disposal we are all familiar with; wondering how we ever survived before they were invented: Solving crimes in much the same way as the rest of us with slower wits try to solve riddles.  Enjoy it all while you can.  In typical British fashion, no matter how successful this series might be my guess is that there will only be about ten episodes ever made spread over a period of about five years before the principle players fear being \\"Type-cast\\" and are anxious to move on in their careers.  Curiously, the same rule never seems to apply if they are lured over to Hollywood to perform in a twenty episode `Season' for American TV.  Strange folks are actors.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book so much. it has a mixture of action sadness and romance. i would recomend this fo anyone. this book changed my life.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|Honestly this was the first Rihanna album I listened to all the way through. I bought it for my sister for her birthday, and I decided I'd give it a listen to determine whether or not it was the censored version. Turns out it WAS! I was a little disappointed because Amazon didn't specify that in the product overview. But it's censored lyrics didn't really affect the enjoyment of listening to the tracks. My favorites are S&M, What's My Name, Cheers, Only Girl (my favorite overall), Man Down, and Love the Way You Lie Part 2. The rest are kind of fillers.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|I was expecting the worse after reading the reviews. The picture was great. They jumped from camera to camera during the first song, which probably caused the bad review. It was great, will watch over and over.
0689865384|2.0|I tried giving the first novel a try when I saw it on clearance at a shop for a huge bargain price and I hear so many people talking about it.  Okay, so the prose is rather basic. I can live with minimalist basic writing since the concept was intriguing.  BUT there is a HUGE question I've been having. So everyone in the society, once they hit age 16, undergoes extensive surgery to drastically alter their appearance and their only job, as stated in the novel, is to party and have fun. How does the economy work?? They seem to have so much material things, like all sorts of toys and clothes.    If they party all the time, who mans the machines? The crops? Extracting metals and materials from the earth? If you say it's set in a futuristic era where most things are taken over by robots, even in a few hundred years, they can't do everything. Like teaching. Or, at least, humans are needed to manufacture these robots and maintain them.    Who are the doctors? The teachers?    Are they just given money? The materials to make these things don't just come out of nowhere! How is it determined who gets what and more of which? Why would anyone wish to forsake a life of relaxation and partying to voluntarily cater to others? Since there are so many people, there definitely needs to be a lot of workers! And you can't say the uglies are the ones who do, since your workforce can't consist of children!    ???? How does their economy exist and function on that sort of foundation? Now I only finished half of the book before I had to put it down out of confusion and suspicion at the delineations of the sort of society the author has already established, and can't bring myself to continue when it ceased to be believable to me. Maybe I missed or misunderstood something?    I don't get it.  Someone please enlighten me.  I can't read a book with such a huge, obvious plothole.    Please enlighten me if I missed something.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|You know, when I heard Josh Groban's last CD, \\"Awake\\", it took me a while to adjust.  It was so unique and just its own personal collection of songs.  The other two seemed very much the same and \\"Awake\\" was an entirely different flavor.  This CD is much the same way.  It has such a different feel from the other CD's that it is its own entirely.  The music is incredible and once again Josh Groban has risen to a whole new level.  I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys good music, I love it!!
B0041KOVUU|5.0|Great songs and a great package My favorite, \\"Spangled\\", is a nice little love song. A Pumpkins classic already. The other three (radio single \\"Freak\\", Tom Tom, and the fellowship are good pumpkin staples as well. Definitely a must for a collector, but you can download the songs for free on Smashing Pumpkins.com. Even better than volume one.
B000VSBX34|3.0|Look, there's all the reviews you need here on this beloved Beatle offering. I just have one problem. In a scene where the four lads are sitting at a bar, one of them gets chopped off out of frame. This leads me to believe (although I don't know for sure) that viewers aren't getting the whole movie here. Other than that, it's just as wonderful as when I first saw it as a seven-year-old, albeit now I have adult sensibilities and the knowledge that the Fabs were being run around the world (literally) in making this movie and during their grueling tours.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I've been belly dancing for a year and a half and have Sadie and Brice's videos.  This is an awesome dvd.  Wonderful choreography and yoga sets.  Some of the parts are way too difficult for beginners, though.  Luckily I had 8 years of ballet behind me, as some of the ballet-inspired moves would be confusing for a lot of people.  There is not a whole lot of explanation there and those parts go waaaay too fast.  But overall, I really love it!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie is ones of those like White Christmas. A classic in its own way. The story is so involved with 2 people in the same place at a different time trying to get together when they already have in the past or is it the future? You decide! Guess you will just have to buy this one to find out. I Laughed, I cried, it touched my heart. A must have for the Holidays or any time you just want to sit down and watch a really really great movie. I actually have 2 copies just in case i wear one out!
0891419063|5.0|A war story through an infantry man's eyes and ears, that made me realize why we won the war, and why we had to win, and why we had to drop the bomb to do so.
B0041T52S6|4.0|Cute movie, was impressed by the unique style of the film.  Liked the comic book flare and video game references.
B000E5KJFM|4.0|Interesting release from the writer of \\"Traffic\\", Stephen Gaghan, his first time out as a director. Much more complex than that film, \\"Syriana\\" boast a great cast with an Oscar winning performance from George Clooney. The film is terrific in Hi-Def (HD DVD or Blu-ray) and holds up very well on multiple viewings--recommended!!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I love this movie and amazon delivered on time.  Not only that, but the DVD was unscathed after traveling from the warehouse to my front door.
B0043RGY60|4.0|Well I must say it is not what I expected. I like it, but not love it. The DVD content is pretty awesome, although they could have added more about the Summit and live footage. I mean, we all know the video for CTTE,so nothing new there. The 'Making of The Ride' part was the best, my favourite from the DVD. I have to say the photos disappointed me, c'mon, screencaps from CTTE? Where are the photos we sent from the shows?    The CD..oh well, nice to have some originals from \\"Bad Romance\\" and \\"Stronger\\". I expected \\"Hurricane\\" do be different from the one that leaked last year, but it's the same.    All in all,I like it. Not a huge fan of This Is War, but the deluxe edition is pretty cool.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|We are extremely happy to have picked up this box set. I've owned bits and pieces of different beetles cd's over the years and this one I am especially proud to own. The price from Amazon.com was just impossible to pass up.Get one for yourself, you won't be dissapointed.
B0041VB8BO|5.0|Alright, here's the deal. I never do reviews. This is my first one. But if anyone were to come here and see no reviews and therefore think, \\"welp... obviously I should pass on that one,\\" I would feel horrible... simply aweeful. Fact is, if you are a fan of good melodies and intelligent music, you will like this. If you liked old weezer, if you put on a bit of promise ring here and there, of course if you liked the Format [[ASIN:B0000DD51N Interventions & Lullabies]] (the \\"old\\" fun.), and DEFINITELY if you like Queen, you WILL like fun. . The brilliant poppy sound, and unexpected melodies are accompanied with smart and original arangements. Cello and violin are intertwined with trumpet and piano to give the music an original sound that is full and intriguing.   ...  The music is best defined by the name of the band. And everyone needs a little..... fun, that is. C'mon jack, you know a playlist or your newest dj badd a-- mix is no good without the upbeat pop candy. Throw in some intelligent weezer, the kids will love it.    Fun.  here it is. T    taste, enjoy. love, pass around. repeat.    Seriously, this is definitely one of my favorites of 2010.
030726999X|5.0|This is the 3rd book in Larsson's trilogy.  It is absolutely wonderful.  The book brings everything to a conclusion in an amazing fashion.  A truly great book in a magificent series.  Do you think I liked it?  You bet.  Very good price from Amazon as well.
0312330871|5.0|Arrived at this one very late, but it lived up to its reputation. A good book to take a break with.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|I'll try not to mention any spoilers.  Let just say that this movie is to the other predator movies, as....Cousin Vinny is to serious drama.  I would recomned seeing it as a Netflix, or some friend.<br /><br />It is slow, the plot is poorly generated. the characters are forced.  All in all, if I hadn't scene it would have been better.  This really needs to be flushed for what it is.
B009ERK35W|3.0|Allegra Geller has just created a new game called eXistenZ. At its d&eacute;but someone tries to tooth her to death in the name of reality. Her body guard Ted Pikul in an attempt to save Allegra's life takes her on the run through reality and alternate realities. Does the daring duo escape and foil the bad instigator or will they be lost forever \\"neath the streets of Boston?\\"<br /><br />If you are a fan of gore, slime, and tasty treats you may have an interest in this film. They attempt to create a \\"worlds within worlds\\" effect. However it has been done before and much better. You may want to watch \\"The Thirteenth Floor\\" (same year 1999) or read \\"Sophie's World: A Novel About the History of Philosophy\\" by Jostein Gaarder.<br /><br />Jude Law is always great in whatever character he plays. Somehow he has the possibility to have you believe he is the character and not just an extraordinary actor. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a cutie but her character is a little farfetched; she still cranked out quite a few films after this one.
159448385X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini writes beautifully with great imagination and detail.   This story is heartbreaking but it's amazing.  I love the history woven in as well. I can't wait for the next novel
B004498KPU|5.0|I AM A MICHAEL JACKSON FAN FOR YEARS, AND LUV THIS 3 DVD SET.  IT HAS SOME VIDEOS THAT I HADENT SEEN BEFORE.  LUV, LUV, LUV IT VERY MUCH !!
038533348X|5.0|Vonnegut is very satirical and it is portrayed here perfectly. His humor is subtle yet endearing. Truly a literary great.
B000005HFH|4.0|This album brought back a lot of fond memories, especially My Funny Valentine.  Kay Jordan, where ever you are, still love you baby!
B003H9MSPG|5.0|When Amazon had their Nerf Holiday sale, I purchased this rifle for $20.  At that price point it is an excellent product.  I actually does seem to shoot a little further than some of the other rifles and we have had no problems with jams.  I would not go over $25 for it, but at $20 it is well worth purchase for your nerf arsenal.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I remember growing up, we had this short animation on VHS, and my mom bought it for the family on DVD and it arrived just today. I'm watching it right now and it still lives up to my childhood memory. This is a great story and if you have never seen it and are contemplating getting it, don't think twice, you won't be disappointed. My only disappointment with this film is that it isn't given it's proper dues...this should be mandatory available in ALL retail stores.<br /><br />Told through a musical score that is some beautiful, and animated to feel like you're reading it straight from the children's book!
B0001K9IJ8|1.0|Can only play on stereo or better players, not thru i tunes. Did not care for the musical selections even the she is my favorite female singer.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|What can I say? I love Christmas music and I love Mariah Carey and her oh so unique voice. I can't decide if I like this album or her first Christmas album more. A winner as far as I am concerned.
B000VBIGD6|4.0|I love all the vacation movies. I collect them.  This video is funny and gets you into the christmas spirit.  I'd rather see a funny christmas story then a sappy sad one.
B003TXKSWK|3.0|This was not the best John Legend in my library but I enjoy it never the less. It sort of grew on me.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|The music is wonderful. The movie is a must see as a musical. Christina really shows the strength of her voice in this one!!
B002BWP4A6|1.0|I strongly recommend avoiding this film if you like to watch films for entertainment purposes.  The other one star reviewers gave honest descriptions, I do not need to repeat what they have said.  I watched this movie on my DVR and often checked the remaining minutes, not sure if I should stop watching it or continue, seeking closure, or for something to happen that would pull it all together.  No such luck.  I have never felt compelled to write a movie review before, but this time I did because I hope I can spare others the waste of time and utter disappointment that this film brings.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching people hurt each other physically and mentally, in a dark and gloomy atmosphere, this film is for you.  The acting and technical quality of this film is very good, but the content is miserable, depressing, pointless, and is exceptionally difficult to follow.<br /><br />I only hope that you heed my advice and avoid this film for you own well-being.
0812974786|5.0|i bought this book for my father. We read it in highschool and it is just one of those books you must read and have in your library. The story of Buddha, or rather, Siddhartha, is a total classic for any age.
0385340540|1.0|I ordered this book on November 23rd, it was a Christmas gift and I never received it. On December 10th I e-mailed Ashland Book Shoppe  and told them that I had not received the book. I received and e-mail from then on December 16th telling me that there had been an increase in misdeliveries and damage of packages in transit, that they would re-ship it, and, since I told them it was a Christmas gift, I would have it no later than December 23rd but I never received it. I am e-mailing them now to get a credit on my account and will never buy from them again. I did all my Christmas shopping on the Internet and this was the only item I never received. Bad experience.
0634060384|1.0|[[ASIN:1589097963 Interface: Poetry and Selected Readings, Volume One, 2010]]<br /><br />This book is hand written, not typed. The writing is readable but it looks like someone just took xerox copies and had it book bond. Many of the dynamics do not make sense to me. I would not recommend this music book because it does not comform with standard writing practices.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Helboy 2 does not disappoint. The first Hellboy film had fight scenes that felt like you were watching professional wrestling at one time. You felt as if you knew how the fights would turn out.    Not in this film.    Good action scenes, compelling story and characters that you actually care about. It's not a vehicle for visual effects either. Includes hilarious use of Barry Manilow song.    The product description suggests that it comes with 3 discs and it does: two DVDs and a digital copy of the film which has since expired at the time that I write this review.    The film could have been a higher grossing film if the director hadn't insisted on going up against The Dark Knight for the Summer 2008 box office.
0316077054|5.0|This book had a slow start but finished quickly became interesting.  I can't wait for the next book in this series!
B000QXDED6|4.0|Stirring story, good battle sequences and solid acting. The film carries itself like a true Spartan - laconic to the end, never sparing effort on anything unneeded.    Features brief nudity of the Oracle of Delphi. Only sexual content is between a husband and wife before going off to war.    Mature subject matter. Not for children.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Natalie Portman delivers the performance of a lifetime in Darren Aronofsky's latest psycho-thriller, Black Swan. Nina, played by Portman, is a child-like ballerina dancing for a prestigious New York dance company. Despite years of immaculate discipline, her inability to lose herself in her dancing has prevented the company's director (Vincent Cassel) from giving her the roles she wants. But when he decides to cast Nina as the Swan Queen in the upcoming production of Swan Lake, despite her trouble dancing the part of the Black Swan, she is forced onto a disturbing descent into the darkest recesses of her troubled mind in a quest to uncover her inner Black Swan.     Aronofsky blends lyrical dance sequences with shocking moments of traditional horror in this dark portrayal of mental illness and the stresses of life as a ballerina. The costume design is stunning in its beauty and symbolism, though it occasionally runs the risk of being too on-the-nose with its white and black color scheme. Similarly, Nina's increasingly horrifying hallucinations make physical monsters of the abstract longings that prey on her, as when her eyes turn blood red after an act of physical violence. As a result, it becomes impossible at times to distinguish between reality and fiction in Nina's world, as is often the case in scenes involving Nina's rival and shadow self, Lily (Mila Kunis). Kunis shines as the darkly seductive ballerina from San Francisco, whose dangerous beauty has Nina vacillating between feelings of threatened paranoia and longing. But whether Lily even exists is only one of many questions that Aronofsky leaves hanging at the end of the film. Labyrinthine in its complexity, Black Swan is also one of the most shocking and beautiful films I've seen lately. Five stars.
B000VDUWMC|2.0|I already know this book is interesting and I'm looking forward to read it, but I give it just 2 stars because this is a very poor kindle edition. I'm pro e-book reading all the way, that's I'm a bit disappointed to see an edition done with no care at all, without the maps and illustrations that you can find on the paper edition. These maps, figures, diagrams are vital to the full comprehension and enjoyment of the book; they must be in the kindle edition also! I hope they will release a new kindle edition soon and that we can download it again for free, because this one doesn't favour at all the pleasure of reading on a e-ink device.
159562015X|1.0|Recently, by husband brought home Clifton's Strength Finder 2.0 (which he was required to read for work).  One night before bed, I picked up the book and was interested.  I enjoy taking personality tests and finding out if I agree with the results found by test.  I knew that I could not use the access code in the book (since it was a one time use only), so I figured I would be able to purchase an access code online.      I then discovered the answer to my question: \\"Can I buy more Clifton StrengthsFinder access codes without buying more books?\\" on the Clifton website. [..]  The answer was as follows:    \\"No. Clifton StrengthsFinder access codes are available only through the purchase of certain Gallup books. The purchase of any one of these books entitles the buyer to only the single access code accompanying the book. Click here for more information about Gallup books available for purchase.\\"      This makes me very angry.  We already have a book in our home, and do not need to purchase another.  My husband states that the company just wants people to buy more books so they can be on the \\"Best Seller's List.\\"  This in turn leads to more books being sold, so, it really boils down to turning a profit.  My husband feels the whole thing is basically a glorified palm reader anyway  and I guess I agree, but I still get suckered into learning more about myself and what type of people I'm compatible with.  I'm disgusted by the whole thing.
081297381X|3.0|This is a 360 page manifesto against Gaussian distribution curves, punctuated by the occasional insinuation that those who embrace a \\"Platonic\\" approach to acquiring knowledge can't get laid. Taleb believes that the statistical models that we build to predict events fail to adequately adjust for rare, unanticipated episodes, which deviate far from any expertly crafted parabola of standards. For example, if we \\"eliminate only the ten biggest one day moves in the U.S. stock market over the past 50 years,\\" the S&P index would hover around 2250, rather than 1250. Meanwhile, a normal distribution would predict a crash as large as the one in '87, with its twenty standard deviations from the mean, to occur every several billion lifetimes of the universe.<br /><br />The book also mentions Lorenz's famous model of weather dynamics, in which a miniscule variation in input parameters (a butterfly flaps his wings in India) can cause a massive change in output (devastating hurricane in New York). It is reminiscent of Hamlet's monologue to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about the infinite faculty and nobility in reason of man, whereupon the courtiers, in their own spin-off play, hypothesize over the reason that their coin keeps flipping heads with \\"One, probability is a factor which operates within natural forces. Two, probability is not operating as a factor. Three, we are now held within um...sub or supernatural forces.\\" Or, as my forefathers used to say, \\"''''' '''''', '''' '''''\\" (\\"Man plans, god laughs\\").<br /><br />Taleb, in an ironically Platonic fashion, sets up two broad categories of people, and files them into a neat table. Those who fall under the heading \\"Skeptical Empiricism and the a-platonic school\\" wear suits only to funerals, \\"do not believe that we can easily compute probabilities,\\" \\"consider theorizing as a disease to resist,\\" are \\"not inspired by science, use messy mathematics and computational methods,\\" and attend lots and lots of parties. Meanwhile, those who embrace \\"The Platonic Approach\\" \\"rely on scientific papers; go from books to practice,\\" \\"wear dark suits, white shirts, speak in a boring tone,\\" and, horror of horrors, \\"live in New Jersey (ouch!).\\" Most legit scientists understand to avoid making broad sweeping claims about the wide applicability of their data. And smart economists, even many who utilize predictive models, can accept the fact that past performance does not guarantee future results, (Economist Tim Hartford discusses this here: [...]) .<br /><br />Taleb's extreme skepticism, along with his obsession with Mandelbrot's fractals, Hayek's Nobel speech, and Umberto Eco's \\"anti-library\\" have their merits and charm. For one, you can never be wrong, if you never care to be right! Or, at least as Taleb puts it, it is far better to be \\"broadly right,\\" while recognizing ones humble limitations, than to be \\"precisely wrong,\\" because what else can we rely on but our models, damnit?! But an obsession with the danger that lurks in rare events, as well as with the overall unpredictability of life can get a tad old for those of us who work day to day trying to convince people, petrified of terror attacks and Ebola pandemics, that their next best move is to just quit smoking.atonic Approach\\" \\"rely on scientific papers; go from books to practice,\\" \\"wear dark suits, white shirts, speak in a boring tone,\\" and, horror of horrors, \\"live in New Jersey (ouch!).\\" Most legit scientists understand to avoid making broad sweeping claims about the wide applicability of their data.

0143118420|3.0|My Recommendation: Skip the praying, stay for the eating and loving.<br />After spending months contemplating and savoring the differences between Roman and Neopolitan pizza, and conjuring up the most luscious metaphors to describe Italy's wines, Gilbert heads to India, where, instead of touring the country, she holes herself up in an ashram to meditate all day. She shares, line by line, her anxieties about properly repeating all the various mantras, as well as her quest for \\"self-mastery,\\" which involves remaining intentionally still as she gets eaten up by mosquitoes. There are better ways to enjoy (or at least describe!) India, even if one is on a religious quest. Gilbert then visits Indonesia, where she hears a \\"sound universe\\" outside her home as a \\"cricket orchestra with frogs providing the baseline\\" and an Eden of unfamiliar plants that she monikers as \\"prom-dress weed,\\" \\"spiral-show off,\\" and \\"melancholy vine.\\" Both her accurate and concocted assessments of Indonesia are beautiful, as are the stories relating to her medicine man, medicine woman, and new lover. (It took some time to get over the idea that, after contracting a PID, Gilbert spurned doctors, and opted for a leaves and newt concoction that her medicine woman created, remaining oblivious to the fact that feeling \\"cured\\" does not mean that her uterine tubes survived unscathed). However, generally Gilbert's idiosyncratic kookiness, awkward adventures, and even her frequent self-reflections are sincere, kind-hearted, and wise.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I believe this movie teaches the viewer that real love can stand the test of time, and about true unconditional acceptance of your partner. It is a true classic in my opinion.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|My favorite track in this album is \\"Tron Legacy (End Titles)\\".  This soundtrack is produced incredibly well.  I can't think of a better artist or composer who could have created this soundtrack better than Daft Punk!

0312370849|5.0|Oh my gosh, how sad for the people at that time.  Made me cry.  Great book, all should read to understand those times.
B00004U8P9|4.0|My item arrived almost the next day which amazed me considering the time of year.Item is brand spanking new, in packaging, perfect condition, as described.My only gripe is with the subtitles. Although they are off on the tv and are also turned off on the dvd menu it still insists on putting them back on shortly after every re-set. Quite annoying but I'm sure I'll figure out a way to get the dvd set to keep the subtitles turned off. Even with that, I am very happy and would not hesitate to buy from this seller in the future.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Ohhhh, what a great movie, Richard Gere is great, but Hachi, is a real treat.  A make your heart cry tears for Hachi.  Loved it, also bought one to send as gift.
B002ZG9846|4.0|I had no intention of watching this movie.  I've been a diehard comicbook fan since childhood and thought that it would denegrate the genre.  I have to give the movie it's due, in no small part because of Nicholas Cage, Chloe Moretz and Mark Strong.  Matt Vaughn does a good job of holding this film together because it could easily have unravelled at any number of points.  It's still a spoof on super heros and in that respect, I'll always be a little dismayed.  On the otherhand, one has to smile ruefully at the idea of a kid like Aaron Johnson going out and taking on the underworld -- as if any middleclass kid would even know where to find them in the first place...  If there is one thing about this movie that really bugs me -- admittedly my own hangup -- it is the depiction of Chloe Moretz as a cold-blooded killer and a \\"good little girl\\", much the way that Natalie Portman was portrayed in The Professional.  It's more than a bit unnerving to see an 11 year old girl shooting, hacking and stabbing people to death as nonchalantly as if she were taking gym class.  I know that it's integral to the part in this film and can't really be avoided, but we sit amidst Columbine, Virginia Tech and any number of other teen driven multiple homicides and it makes me cringe more than a little that this movie glorifies that kind of revenge driven violence even for pre-teen girls...  By the way, in case there are any women out there who think my objection has to do with the fact that Moretz and Portman are women, you're off base.  I have flinched just as much in the depiction of boys of the same age acting the same way.  I'm a proud NRA member, but that doesn't mean that we have to make our children numb to the actual affects of committing this kind of violence, nor should we glorify such violence especially when it's portrayed by children.  Okay, off my soapbox.  It's worth watching, but not with your children.

0307463745|4.0|They even put the Copyright mark in the back of the book instead of the front.<br /><br />Defying common business \\"wisdom\\", and basically doing things the way they want to do them, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson have created an extremely successful, and intentionally small company.<br /><br />And they express this defiance through this book.<br /><br />The opinions they express are not popular, nor are they widely accepted in most cases, but the results speak for themselves when it comes to the business built on these opinions.  So what if this book isn't a full 280-whatever pages long?  Chapters are short?  Ok...and?<br /><br />So, don't buy this book if you're searching for the \\"standard\\" book, or the standard ways of operating or building a business.  You won't find it within these pages.  And that is what makes this book good in my opinion.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I wanted to love this watch and I'm normally an easy reviewer. I bought this for use while deployed as a simple, consolidated way to get GPS grids, tell time, and monitor work outs. The bezel is the least enjoyable user interface for any device I've ever used (at any of the three sensitivities). I may in fact have a lemon because the light used to constantly turn on and off without me doing anything (whether it's on my wrist or not). I wish I could blame the poor performance on the dust, debris, heat, or a rough tumble but this is not the case. I received this watch during the winter (above freezing though). Still haven't even broken the seal on the plastic wrap for the heart rate monitor etc. I've worn it for maybe 3 weeks now. The charge is weak, but I read the specs prior to and accepted that. If I did in fact receive a bad copy, the only functional mistake with the watch is the inability to change the units for the GPS coordinates (you can change all other coordinates but the GPS, I'd prefer MGRS obviously). We'll see what Garmin says, I'm about to contact them- currently the watch bezel never works, locked unlocked. The buttons work great though. Tried and true (much like my trusty $20, Casio 1846). Man I wished this watch worked.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I would like to start of and say what an amazing series this has been. With every season bringing something new to the table, it has made this show a pleasure to watch. In this latest installment we see the Winchester brothers come to grips with reality, and the decisions they have made up until Season 4. Don't wanna give away too much for those who have not yet caught up or are new to the series, but its well worth it! New adventures and a twists that make this season a great prequel to season 6!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I immediately carefully loaded the USB into my computer and then put the apple away for display later.<br /><br />I then started playing the content and looking a the videos.  I don't have audiophile equipment so I just play the 320kb MP3's which sound better than anything I've ever heard.<br /><br />I re-lived the experience of hearing the Beatles in stereo for the first time, when stereo was new, and when I shivered to hear a lick come out of the opposite speaker (as I said, stereo was new then....)<br /><br />I immediately put all the songs into my Zune directory, and Zune for Windows Phone 7 immediately synced them automatically as I created a rule for the artist \\"The Beatles\\".  Zune plays the songs, associates album art, has reviews and other comments available right away.<br /><br />I did have to use the Zune converter from [...] in order to convert the (no file extension) files which were really .flv's, in order to put the videos in my video library and have them automatically synced as well.<br /><br />I could not have asked for a better collection of Beatles songs and documentary video, all brought together quite easily by Zune and Windows Phone 7.<br /><br />I only wish there was a 6-star rating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book positively blew me away. It was the climax of the 3 books, no doubt. Suzanne Collin packs scene after scene of raw, powerful action that makes this book a pageturner. The capital is more sinister, the characters more real, the plot mor fast-paced, and everything is more... Just more. Collins skillfully weaves deep, authentic characters from the loose ends in The Hunger Games. The shocking Catching Fire introduces you to a violent, jarring world that will linger in your brain forever. An unforgettale sequel to The Hunger Games and a great buy.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|This is a pretty good DVD, it's not as good as Disasterpieces but it is good. Definetly worth the money. The DVD includes 2 discs, Disc One containing the band's full performance at Download Festival 2009 in Donington, England in high quality. A kick ass performance. Expect the usual brutalness that make their setlist. Also includes music videos for \\"Psychosocial\\", \\"Snuff\\", \\"Sulfur\\" and \\"Dead Memories\\" and an interesting making of the \\"Snuff\\" music video. Disc Two includes a full length film directed by Clown (#6). The packaging has cool artwork and photography as well. Any Slipknot fan would appreciate this release.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I read this series a decde ago and it still lingers vividly in my mind and captivates my imagination. For Herbert to so fully realize a universe is truly astounding. To give it the branding of science fiction does it a disservice. Herbert`s ability to incorporate the same mystical, religious, ecological, cultural, and political undertones that constitute our reality into a universe that is so completely abstract from our reality is, in my opinion, what makes this series timeless. As I have grown older and wiser, the sands of Arrakis and the god worms have tended to fade into the recesses of my memory but the intrigue between the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, the various Houses and other such clashes of belief and culture are what still remain in my mind as the foundation of this epic series. No offense to Tolkien fans but Dune is THE quintessential science fiction series and a great series regardless of genre.
B002YOKVU4|4.0|when a blu ray is released, it should have all features from subsequent releases on board(or at least the \\"better\\" ones)... most notably was the bbc special on hunter s(contained on disc 2 of the criterion version).  there was also a small peice with hunter and johnny on the first release dvd(which is the one i own, and now the bluray), thats not included... WHY?????  all in all the film quality is good, but why do they fail to include things released on previous versions?????<br />disc two from the cc version is the shnizznosh... i also really liked the menu screens from the cc release..<br /><br />i also own the t2 ultimate edition.. i bought the version before it(used from disc replay) and had to return it cause of skipping, however, the menu screen from that version i think is the best... its basiclly the same in the ultimate edition, except the machines inthe factory are t1000, not t800...  the detail with the t800, like when it goes into his skull to see the chip (chapter navigation), in my opinion is far superior... lol.  its little things like this that irk me...  although the ultimate edition  version of the film is prolly one of the best dvd releases, along with the rereleases of the origional star wars trilogy... they look damn good for dvd..  however i am pretty much now officially moved on to blu ray, and im deciding how worth it it is to double up on certian movies.. like i did for fear and loathing..  but the caddys, the desert, the lights... the effects, every thing in fear in loathing... gilliams vision, all of that was enough for me to double up on this one.. besides its one of my favorite flicks, and i love hst!! and gilliam is one of my fave directors too...  other faves include david lynch, david cronenberg, christopher nolan(i liked him before batman) spike jonez, michel gondry...david fincher is really good too....<br /><br />edit:  ive since got the criterion release, which came out a month or so after i purchased this version...  if you like this film, dont settle for anything less than the cc release.. the other version, colors arent right, and the sound dosnt seem to be mixed properly..  in the begining, with toby \\"are you prejeudice? i didnt think so\\" when he taps his chest, that sound is completly missing... little small details like that ruin it for me.. i noticed that on my first viewing of the initial release..this film, dont settle for anything less than the cc release.. the other version, colors arent right, and the sound dosnt seem to be mixed properly..  in the begining, with toby \\"are you prejeudice? i didnt think so\\" when he taps his chest, that sound is completly missing... little small details like that ruin it for me.. i noticed that on my first viewing of the initial release..
B002ZG981E|2.0|Other than the special effects, this movie is kind of boring. The actors were not very convening. There is nothing new about industrial sabotage or even a dream with in a dream. The only complicated thing about the movie is keeping track of the layers of the dream. This is not that hard as each dream layer is very different from the one before.     I see no reason why the movie is as popular as it is. Must be good advertising.   The movie is okay but I'll not waste my time watching it again.
B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|I am happy to have bought this.  Both the beats and the lyrics grow on me with each listen.  Definitely boosts your quality of life.
0439023521|5.0|I'll be honest. I don't read books very often. I'm not what you would call a bookworm. I've bought countless numbers of them though, but none of them have caught my attention enough for me to make it past the first few chapters. I bought this book after reading all of the amazing reviews. I was hesitant, but I figured I might as well give it a shot. I am so glad I did! The characters are amazing and unique, the plot had me on the edge of my seat, and the world is so vivid I could picture it all in my mind as if I were seeing it all on a screen. I'm definitely going to buy the other three. I reccommend this book to everyone!

142311339X|5.0|You know you're having a bad day when you find yourself sitting in the back of a school bus, surrounded by strangers who act as if they know you, but when you think about it, you have no idea who you are!  That is where Jason finds himself, sitting between a girl named Piper and a guy named Leo.  Embarrassingly, Piper is holding his hand like she has a right to!  Does she? He really wishes he knew, `cause frankly, she's kinda cute.    Jason confides his dilemma to his two \\"friends\\", and even their explanation of why they all attend the \\"Wilderness School\\" for difficult kids isn't ringing any bells with him. Apparently they get to go on these educational field trips with the crusty Coach Hedge, today's being to the Grand Canyon.  They're standing over the canyon, on a see-through platform, when a nasty storm threatens, so the Coach tells them to hurry up with their mandatory worksheets, so they can get them done and turned in.  It's a relief to Jason when the Coach admits he's never seen him before today, until he starts spouting some nonsense about monsters and half-bloods and camp.  Oh my.  That's about the point when things start to get really weird.    Jason, Piper and Leo find themselves taken to Camp Half-Blood, in the company of a cranky young lady who has apparently mislaid her boyfriend - a young demigod by the name of Percy Jackson.  It seems that they are all three demigods, which is quite a lot to swallow, but the more of the camp they see, they more they have to believe.  Everyone is curious to see which gods their parents are, as the gods are much swifter in claiming their own these days.  Leo is immediately claimed by Hephaestus, Piper turns out to be a child of Aphrodite - somewhat to her chagrin, as she has never been one to concern herself with issues of beauty - and Jason belongs to Jupiter himself, that is, Zeus.    Even for a demigod, there is something strange about Jason.  The first time Chiron sees him, he exclaims, \\"You should be dead.\\"  Buthe won't explain why.  And why does Jason think in Latin, rather than in Greek?  And what's with that SPQR tattoo on his arm?  Matters are complicated when Rachel has a vision/prophecy much different than any other.  Not to mention the visions of an old woman that come to Jason - she announces herself as her patron, claims she needs his help.  Putting the pieces of this strange puzzle together, they realize that it is Hera - she has been captured, and unless they find a way to release her, everyone in the world is in serious trouble!    Where is Percy Jackson when you need him?    The Last Hero is the first in the Heroes of Olympus series, which continue after the end of the Percy Jackson books. We are presented with new demigods, and meet some new friends, as well as revisit some of the old.  I wasn't sure what to expect - a rehash, perhaps, of old plot lines, characters of lesser interest than those whom we met in the first books, a dip in quality of the plot simply to get more books onto the market?  I was very pleasantly surprised.  These characters are every bit as engaging as Percy Jackson, and now we have a trio of heroes - Jason, Piper and Leo - to follow.  The chapters rotate, being told in the voice of one of the three.  There is a decided twist to the plotline, a very interesting one, which will be appreciated by those who love stories of the gods.      Mr. Riordan brings mythology to life in a most fascinating way - his books could easily be used by students of the subject.  He doesn't cover only the well known and infamous, he delves deep into the roots themselves with lesser known deities and monsters and their stories.  There is nothing boring about his books.  Although they are rated for ages 9-12, they easily are interesting to older teens and adults as well, much like the Harry Potter series.    There is action, intrigue, mystery, humor and a touch of romance - in other words, something for everyone.  I like these new heroes which he has introduced, and look forward to following them this series.  I would imagine that you could start with this book, not having read the Percy Jackson books, and derive enjoyment from it, but how much greater the pleasure if you read the first five books before you do.  Become steeped in Camp Half-Blood and its inhabitants, as well as the gods from which these kids descend.  You'll be glad you did.
B0047VEE0U|4.0|The only issue I had with this set, is when I opened it, one of the CDs had fallen out along with the booklet, and bent the pages a bit. Other than that, I'm very much impressed!      The sheet music is different for everyone; I got \\"Detonators\\". It has a 100% REAL autograph on it by Desplat! I honestly didn't catch that part when I ordered it, which makes this totally worth the money. (Not a big fan of the fact it's on glossy paper, but if it was on REAL sheet music, the signature would bleed and smear easily.)    I thought the actual printed vinyl would have been normal size, not the mini kind -- but it's wonderful nevertheless. Harry on one side, and the burning Hogwarts on the other <3    The film cells are FANTASTIC -- I've been stuck with cells that have sucked, but these are perfectly centered and cut. I had a cell of Voldemort holding onto Harry's face, and the second is Hermione putting up the wards in the forest with Harry kneeling next to Ron behind her.    I was a bit confused at first, seeing as the Harry and Voldy scene was NO WHERE in the first part of the movie...    But it's still awesome! :)
B004BSIJ9Q|1.0|I didn't really like any of his songs. Besides, he seems to be a very arrogant person! I prefer Bruno Mars or Brian McKnight. Don't waste your money on Kayne West.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This is an outstanding read and gave me insight into the man Frank Lloyd Wright was.  I fell in love with Mamah, who gave her all to FLW and as far as I am concerned, Mamah was ahead of her time.  She was a true maverick with a brilliant intellect and fine taste.  Actually I thought her to be to good for FLW.  Her tragic ending is Shakesperian!  I mourn for her and her children.  What a wonderful woman she was and a gift to all who knew her.

B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|A young boy named Billy (Hayden McFarland) who wants to believe in Santa Claus gets his wish as a magical train and the conductor (Tom Hanks) gives him a ticket to hop aboard the magic train to the North Pole with other children especially the fast talking nerd boy named Know-it-all (Voiced by Eddie Deezen) as they head on an all till midnight journey to see Santa Claus before he leaves to give them their gifts.<br /><br />A magicial, imaginative and well done CGI animated fantasy that is very faithful to the popular kids book by Chris Van Allan. This is one of the first attempts at photorealism in CGI animation before Avatar perfected it, it feels a little plastic and crooked at times but who cares. Tom Hanks plays all 5 different characters and even has a voice by Steven Tyler in two roles, Robert Zemeckis has made an enjoyable and wonderful Christmas treat for everyone.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers stunning quality picture and flawless sound like if you saw it in theaters and of course there's great extras like trailer, featurettes, and motion capture segments.
B00461BQC0|5.0|I must say, these young men are getting better with each album.  I hear some of the old stuff in here, as well as their growth and maturity that comes with living and loving.  The sly jokes are still there, as well as the willingness to jump out on that musical limb and see where it takes you.  Matthew Followill is truly the most under-appreciated guitarist of our era, right up there with Will Kimbrough and Gary Moore - simply stunning.  As for Michael Followill, his bass playing is as evident, amazing and powerful as usual.    The only other thing I can offer is to say if you have not bought these fine artists' music yet, please do so now.  Also buy their older albums as well and enjoy them to the fullest, because you'd be hard pressed to find anything better.  The closest I've seen so far is My Morning Jacket.  Thank God for these two groups and others like them, because Rock is is very safe and capable hands.  Justin Bieber and his fans need to study at the altar of Caleb Followill and Jim James to see and learn how its done.  Drummers such as myself will do well to study Ivan Followill and Pat Hallahan of MMJ, because they are two of the meanest groove machines on the planet right now.

B004AQR29C|5.0|This is how action movies need to made and used to made. There is nothing like seeing 6 heroes going up against 200 and not being scratched. This is an action movie and nothing more. There is a story in there facilitating the reason for the action, but who cares!?! Its all about the bullets flying and the explosions to begin with.

Jillian is tough but not like on Biggest Loser -- lots of encouragement instead of name-calling.
0553805371|5.0|THE GRAND DESIGN is a provocative work, which addresses a range of tantalizing questions in cosmology, while doing so in an accessible and entertaining fashion. Its view of the universe, I might add, is complemented by another book that came out at roughly the same time: THE SHAPE OF INNER SPACE. While THE GRAND DESIGN takes a large-scale view of the universe, in covering the broad sweep of cosmology, THE SHAPE OF INNER SPACE views things on a much smaller scale, focusing on the inner workings of the universe, which may stem from the geometry of postulated \\"hidden dimensions,\\" too tiny to be seen. Both books are highly recommended, and the composite picture that one can get from reading them both is quite amazing.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Excellent CD.  The recording quality is excellent and this CD has two of the better female voices in the theatre today.  If you didn't see the original play, this is the next best thing.  Enjoyed it very much.
030746363X|3.0|I heard about the book through a couple of blogs that I frequent (gawker, zenhabits) and it sounded pretty cool, so I bought it on my iPad. What captured me the most was his self-experimentation style, and adventurous personality. The book makes for a fun and easy read in general.    With that being said the more I read the more skeptical I become about the actual claims made in the book. The first thing that caught my eye was the no fruit rule in his 'slow-carb diet'. Also the complete refrain from using the word Atkins made me a little suspicious. And it goes on and on like that; little tendencies that it seems Tim thinks we won't pick up on (can't remember anymore right now, but if I do I'll get back to this)    However, Tim's energy is motivating me somehow, which inspired me to conform to his slow-carb diet/Atkins for a week. The week is up and I've lot ten pounds, so here's to another week.

0553381687|5.0|George R.R. Martin has written the first verse of his \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" and begun an astounding series with as many layers and facets as any novel you are likely to find today. This book should once and for all answer the question of whether the genre of fantasy can hold truly great literature. His characters are, for the most part, well balanced, his world is realistic (often grossly and brutally so), and he manages to keep the political intrigue interesting where most writers would have made it an 800 page burden on the reader. If you do not mind the mature content (Martin's series may be fantasy, but it is most definitely not for children), an incredible story awaits you behind this book's golden cover.<br /><br />The chapters told from the views of Eddard Stark and Tyrion Lannister are the high points of the novel, Eddard for his nobility and largely selfless character (a rare breath of fresh air in this book - more on that in a moment), and Tyrion for his wit and clever exploitation of almost everyone who crosses his path. But the stories surrounding Jon Snow, Catelyn Culley, Daenarys Targaryen, and Arya Stark are all captivating and carry much of the story's nuance and meatiness.<br /><br />There are only two complaints I have for the book. First of all, the supernatural could probably stand to have a greater presence in the book. In fantasy, political backbiting and the escalating struggle for the seat of power in Westeros will only take you so far before readers lose interest, especially with the reams of pages between the magical events and creatures that make Martin's work a fantasy novel. Nevertheless, what little magic there is in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is spectacular and original whenever it (finally) shows up. My second complaint is admittedly motivated in part by my personal tastes. Martin has set up a brutally cynical world and storyline, and the characters mostly go along with this crushing lack of optimism. Any who dare to show a little more hope and fight for it will be punished severely for it. I received the impression that the writer had stuck his characters into a concentration camp, with magic and sincerity tightly rationed. Frankly, I felt that even in Westeros, with its declining connection to the supernatural and the long list of Machiavellian leaders, there was still some room for a brighter picture, but Martin runs away from it whenever it shows its pleasant face. I am aware he made this choice deliberately, but it is hard to see what makes the characters continue in their struggles if they receive so little reward for it.<br /><br />These issues aside, I loved \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" eagerly anticipate the HBO series adapting it, and I highly recommend this book if you want some fantasy that is realistic and layered for a change.t will be punished severely for it.

B003K025V4|4.0|I bought this album for myself and not for a daughter, so I'm looking at it from a different perspective than many of the other reviewers here. I don't know if I would buy it for a child, it might be a little mature for that. Miley is moving on to more adult things, which is fine. We all grow up eventually, right?<br /><br />The album is good, has an upbeat attitude to it that I really enjoy. My favorite on the album is \\"Every Rose Has its Thorn\\". Having never heard the original before, I haven't got anything to compare it to and therefore criticize it because it is different. My only complaint about the album is one or two of the songs start out with a really great beat and I feel like it's going to be a great song, but then the lyrics turn a bit lame and it ruins the song for me...such is the case with \\"Who Own's My Heart\\". That song had so much potential until the lyrics ended it all. Mostly, though, this is one of my favorite albums, I wasn't disappointed in it at all.
B002ZG999U|4.0|There are cinematic all-star gatherings which dazzle you with their sheer acting chops, and then there's THE EXPENDABLES. This movie won't convince a guy to sign up at the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute, but it might make him revisit his 1980s action film collection or at least suck in his gut a little tighter, flex his guns a little more. I'm kinda bummed that Chuck Norris, Seagal, and Van Damme aren't here, because it seems like just about every other action film star for the past twenty years shows his mug in this picture. You could almost smell the geriatric testosterone oozing from the screen.<br /><br />Cue the cameos. When a shady CIA spook (Bruce Willis) presents a mission that even Barney Ross's rival (Schwarzenegger) turns down, Ross (Stallone) snaps it up. Me, I wasn't clear on the mission's specificity, other than it takes place on some island nation called Velena, which has been overrun by a corrupt American (Eric Roberts) and his murderous cronies. There's a hot Latin honey (Giselle Iti&eacute;) involved, and she catches Ross's droopy eyes, except that there's about eighty years' difference in age between the two. Not to be outdone, Ross's right hand man, Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), romances none other than Charisma Carpenter. Alas, Jet Li's character arc amounts to his always demanding more money. He's smaller, Jet contends, and so has to work harder and should get compensated more.<br /><br />Stallone directs and acts. Or directs, anyway. Look, what did you expect? Certainly not a nuanced storyline, I hope. This film is nuanced in the same way that Sly is glib with the tongue twister. What Stallone achieves best here is sort of like what Coach Phil Jackson does with his championship teams, which is manage the egos. Most of the burly dudes featured here are used to starring in their own flicks, so from the angle of massaging his cast, I thought Sly did a bang up job. Each actor gets his moment to shine and show off his wares. I was amazed at Sly's rapid reload scene. Dolph Lundgren once again channels his inner crazy to pretty good effect. Bullets fly with abandon. Things blow up. Brutal fighty fights erupt. Salonpas and Preparation H are generously applied. All according to Stallone's vision. This is a far cry from ROCKY, a lot closer to GET CARTER or ASSASSINS. There are some hardcore kill shots.<br /><br />But, again, it's not about the creaky story. It's all about this summit meeting of action stars, past and present, and their interactions, convivial and violent. I thought that Sly got on well with Statham and Mickey Rourke, and that's fine.  Mickey Rourke's scenes, by the way, come off like he just strolled in from a much better flick. Imagine if Clint Eastwood had been in this one? He would've slaughtered everyone with his acting presence and, literally, with his big .44 Magnum.<br /><br />I had big rapt eyes set on the various dust-ups, like Jet Li taking on Dolph Lundgren and, later, martial artist Gary Daniels (who starred in some actioners in his heyday). And a brawl pitting Randy \\"the Natural\\" Couture against \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin, well, it could only end with a Superman punch. Apropos of nothing, Couture earns bonus points for later, in real life, taking on boxer James \\"Lights Out\\" Toney and forcing a submission out of him in the first round. One big beef I have is that Jet Li's character had to be saved at least twice by Stallone. That's just friggin' disrespectful to Jet, who in his prime could've probably wiped the floor with the cast. But, out of all of them, it's Jason Statham who comes out the most dynamic in the buttkicking department. Handsome Rob is in his physical prime, friends. Critics can knock low brow cinema all they want. Sometimes, folks just want to eyeball explosions and shoot-em-'ups and sheer undiluted machismo. Concerning THE EXPENDABLES, I hear there's a sequel in the works. So snobs can suck it. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.<br /><br />The single DVD's extrastuff: Sly Stallone's audio commentary; \\"Before the Battle\\" is the Making Of feature which goes out of its way to document Sly's various injuries incurred during the shooting of the film (00:15:38 minutes long); one deleted scene featuring Gunner (Lundgren) cracking a joke during the film's opening sequence (00:00:45); a gag reel (00:05:03); and the marketing archive (the theatrical trailer, TV spots, and a poster gallery).stuff: Sly Stallone's audio commentary; \\"Before the Battle\\" is the Making Of feature which goes out of its way to document Sly's various injuries incurred during the shooting of the film (00:15:38 minutes long); one deleted scene featuring Gunner (Lundgren) cracking a joke during the film's opening sequence (00:00:45); a gag reel (00:05:03); and the marketing archive (the theatrical trailer, TV spots, and a poster gallery).
B002ZG98C8|1.0|Yawn. If you see people who defend the borders of their own country are cast as racist, brutal idiots and illegal immigrants are cast as heroes, I think you can guess what the movie is trying to get at.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. We are introduced to Machete. It seems that he is going into a house to get someone out of it. Apparently he was set up and the people brought his wife there and killed her before his eyes. Somehow, he escaped from this.<br />2. Later, someone hires him to kill a Racist Government Official.<br />3. It turns out that he was setup for that, too. (Can a guy be so unlucky?) So, he gets shot, but manages to (a) survive; (b) get sent to a hospital that has Mexicans working for The Resistance; (c) shoot his way out of the hospital and get taken care of by a nice looking woman who runs a hotdog stand/ checkpoint of something like an Underground Railroad.<br />4. Next we get a very silly looking Cheech Marin as a drinking, potty-mouthed priest who is part of the Mexican Underground Railroad who helps with some logistics when Machete is going after the family of the man who set him up.<br />5. Machete does go somewhere and find the daughter and wife of the man swimming naked. He brings his ugly face out of nowhere and gets his freak on with these two fine looking women (yeah, right) and then kidnaps them.<br />6. A couple of people get killed (including the priest, who is crucified in the church and the Hot Dog Stand/ Mexican Underground Railroad woman who is shot in the face).<br />7. The Mexicans stage some sort of civil resistance (and it is at this point that I stopped watching because the movie was just getting so silly).<br /><br />So, what do we have?<br /><br />1. Silly casting. (Cheech Marin as a priest. Steven Seagal as, well, anything.) Danny Trejo, however, looked OK as Machete.<br />2. Annoying political tone. (Illegal Mexicans=good/ victims. Gringos= bad. Businesses= bad. Government defending its borders= bad.)<br />3. General plot implausibility. (How can someone with a machete be unstoppable, when people who have guns have so much less to do to kill someone? How can someone be shot in the neck and then jump of a second/ third story window out of a hospital and keep going, let alone take down 4 or 5 men with big guns? Give me a break.)<br /><br />Save your money.<br /><br />Save your money.a machete be unstoppable, when people who have guns have so much less to do to kill someone?

0757302661|2.0|I did a lot of research on natural childbirth during my first pregnancy before settling on HypnoBirthing. I read the book cover to cover and took the class. I did the exercises every night for the last five months, sometimes twice a day. Unfortunately, I had a really unrealistic idea of what labor would be like. During the class, the instructor showed us movies of women pushing out babies, and they looked like they were napping. I think there is a very broad range of experiences during labor, and I just wasn't prepared for how painful mine was. I couldn't get on top of it and stay calm because it was so fast and furious from the very beginning. I'm giving the book two stars because three of the seven women in my HypnoBirthing class did have the natural births we all hoped for. The instructor herself, who gave birth to her first baby just weeks after the class was over, begged for, and received, an epidural. I think it says a lot that someone who believes in the method and has taught it for years did not have success with it. I unfortunately had to have an unwanted Cesarean because of the way the baby was positioned, which I think was part of the reason the labor was so painful. I will say that I attribute a lot of the relaxation and enjoyment of my pregnancy to the stress reduction from listening to the CD. Now I am pregnant with my second, and I'm still planning to listen to it every night. I'm hoping that this birth will be easier, but I'm looking into other methods this time. I have no doubt that HypnoBirthing works for some women, and I am very happy for them because I think natural childbirth is so important, but it just wasn't enough in my case.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson is the son of Posidon. Throughout the book Percy, Annabeth, and Grover go through constant adventures. From battling Meddusa to fighting off Lotus eaters this book kept me up for days. The series is a must for reading, but the movie was a rip off. It didn't follow the story line at all. Plus Percy was like the only charaster who was as described in the book. Also Luke did NOT die in the first book and he did NOT die with a water trident, either. Overall I loved this book+ series, so much I had to wresle the book away from my friend to read it (trust me, that was hard. No kidding for a black belt).

1582701709|3.0|The secret is more of a introduction to the new thought philosophy first introduced in the late 1800's with books such as thoughts are things, as a man thinketh, The Science of Getting Rich, The master key system, think and grow rich and books of that type. The secret doesn't really reveal any secret but shows you where to look.     Theirs been a real resurgence in the New thought philosophy now called the law of attraction, but basically its the same thing just renamed.     Some of the better current books on that subject are in my opinion are: Ask and It Is Given, The Magic of Thinking Big, Law of Attraction, Awaken the Giant Within and the little gem [[ASIN:1453763368 Invisible Valium: The Philosophy for Overcoming Stress and Anxiety]]. All are great places to start on the topic.
B002YNS0VC|5.0|The author did a great job in explaining why most of us never reach our full potential.  The reason that we don't has to do with our natural resistance to change even when the change itself will achieve the goals we have.    My biggest take away from the book has to do with the fact that if we can focus our energies on thinking of ourselves as a corporation where we are the boss, it allows us to separate the worker from management, and therefore we can move forward in a professional manner and not get side-tracked with temporary challenges so that our focus remains sharply aligned with creating a positive environment to learn and grow.  This allows us to remain objective and not to take disappointments and setbacks so personally.    This is what makes us professionals.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|At first I loved the CD, I wanted to love it because Rock \\"n\\" Roll Jesus is so great I wore the thing out and it skips so I have to buy another one and I will!  But I noticed after several days I stopped playing Born Free.  While I love Kid Rock's voice on it the songs just weren't that incredible, they were definitely good.  It's hard after you release an Epic Cd as his last one to top or even match it with your next one and unfortunately in my mind anyway, he did not.  I still love his vocals though.  I just couldn't find that stand out song.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|This video, when showed in theaters, made little impact back in 1974. It is a product of their 1972 Exile on Main Street Tour. It includes quite a few songs from that double album--from \\"Happy\\" to \\"Sweet Virginia,\\" from \\"Tumbling Dice\\" to \\"Dead Flowers.\\" Let's consider a sampling of the songs and performances. A couple observations: One, the Stones look so young here! Two, the music rocks.<br /><br />The DVD starts out with a lively \\"Brown Sugar.\\" Watts' driving drumming starts matters off, with chunky guitar playing by Keith Richards and young Mick Taylor.<br /><br />\\"Happy\\" is one of Keith's songs. He still had something of a singing voice here and this segment finds him singing with energy and enthusiasm, backed by Jagger. Tall and rangy Mick Taylor does some fine guitar work.<br /><br />Then, to follow, \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" one of the better cuts from the \\"Exile\\" album. Guitars and rhythm section play off of one another well. Question: How come Charlie Watts doesn't get more face time on this DVD? The brass sound is fine with Bobby Keyes at work. Mick Taylor is not too animated in his movement, but his guitar sound is fine.<br /><br />Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain\\" is a classic blues piece. Here, it is performed nicely, with a slow, bluesy sound. The Stones have normally played the blues with fine results. Here, that is indeed the case.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler\\" is one of my favorite performance songs. The subject of the song is grisly--the Boston Strangler, and the song finishes with his own words used in one of the attacks. The long piece begins with Mick Jagger playing solid harmonica and takes off at a \\"presto\\" pace. The rhythm section (especially Watts) puts down a solid base supporting guitars and vocals. A dynamic version of the song. The extended guitar break is well played by Richards, and supported nicely by Taylor. Acceleration begins toward the climax of the song.<br /><br />A nice cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Bye, Bye Johnny\\" is enjoyable to listen to<br /><br />Then, the twin songs to end the concert footage--\\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man.\\" Richards' guitar licks start of \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" well. A nice animated version. . . . With \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" drums and guitars propel this with considerable momentum.<br /><br />Other songs: \\"Bitch,\\" \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" \\"Dead Flowers,\\" \\"Sweet Virginia,\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" \\"All Down the Line,\\" and \\"Rip This Joint.\\"<br /><br />A good sampling of the Rolling Stones in 1972. While there are occasional rough spots in the performance, for the most part it is an energetic performance, well played.e--\\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man.\\" Richards' guitar licks start of \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" well.

B0021L8V0W|1.0|Ok! I was really looking foward to watching this movie. Right after I received it in the mail I put it in my Samsung 6500. It would not load. Following, I called   Amazon and got a replacement. I tried again, still would not load. I went to a friend's house who had a Panasonic BD85P-K. Guess what! thats right, still would not load. I called Amazon and I got my money back. I then ordered the non-blu ray  disk so I could see it on my standard DVD Player. This is the First Blu Ray title   that I have received from Amazon that I could not watch. So, be careful!
0440539811|5.0|I read Illuminatus in 1977. I tried to read it again recently and found it pretentious and even juvenile but still fun. Then I realized that it was after reading Robert Anton Wilson that I became interested in every subject under the sun and that belief systems are like nose hairs in that they grow automatically and one must trim them away constantly. If you like comic books and James Joyce you may enjoy Illuminatus.
B00005221M|5.0|One of the most superb marriages of cinematic image w/ musical score, this movie always overwhelms me with its beauty and tragedy.     Whatever issues may have existed with the earlier DVD release have now been overcome, and the DVD is flawless, even with an upconverting player to an HD TV. The sound -- an equal partner in this film -- also sharp and pure.    Michael Mann is an extraordinary director, with an incredible eye for visuals. But unlike someone like Ridley Scott, who compares well to Mann visually, Mann never sacrifices story-telling and narrative in order to prove to the world how terribly clever he is with a camera. This story is relentless in its development of characters -- one of which is the frontier itself in pre-revolution America -- and merciless in its development of the story.    The performances are all extraordinary, and without in any way undervaluing any of the leads, I would also note that the supporting cast -- especially Eric Schweig as Uncas and Jodhi May as Alice -- provide the story with great depth and make the tragedy of the story real.    At the risk of being redundant, I'll say again that the music is as stunning as the camera work. This version of the film no longer uses the haunting piece by Clannad, but in many respects makes a more integral use of the original compositions.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I'll start of by saying that this game earns its M rating, kiddies beware. This game is possibly one of my favorite games for the nintendo ds, if not one of my favorite games period. The story immediately sucks you in and refuses to let go until you have played through the game multiple times, and have found out the truth about what is going on. And you will be playing multiple times, because this game is meant to be played multiple times. While I won't expose any spoilers for the story, I will say that anyone who wants to find a game with a lot of depth, and a story that reels you in and refuses to let go, 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors, is the game for you!
0891419063|5.0|Received the book on time and in excellent condition. Was an excellent book and well written. It's difficult for someone involved in war to not skew his writing in one direction or the other. He did an excellent job showing the udliness of war from both sides.

I've connected my air via the adapter and a hama hdmi cable to my sony w5500 lcd tv, made the settings for both video and sound on my air (also set the sound source input in the TV to the hdmi slot that i connected). Great quality.
B0040JHXTS|5.0|Okay first Darkness never sounded better. Not even from the days of my 8-track pull out and speakers the size of my back seat. The Promise has some amazing tunes and ya it's easy to see why some where left out. Haven't watched the concert DVD's yet, but the documentary is definitely rewatchable as it's AWESOME.    The presentation is probably the best box set I've EVER bought. Getting to see the pages from one of Springsteen's notebooks goes way beyond the norm here and when you add into how it's presented with the look and even spiral bound pages, it's just one of those things that will not just get delegated to the shelf like pretty much every other box set I own.
0440246016|1.0|This books was given to me, hence, I'm glad I didn't waste any money. It starts out as a character driven book, but Child quickly loses interest in Reacher's crew once he's given them each one line descriptions. The book then meanders through a series of plot twists that mostly reflect on what Child doesn't know about LA: There's no office parks zone where he describes one, the LAPD and the LA County Sheriff's Dept mix like oil and water--the ex-cops would need to come from one or the other, and Child repeats stereotypes about LA's like of urbanism that are a better match for some sunbelt dystopia like Atlanta or Houston than a city that was built on streetcar lines. As other reviewers have noted, the book seems like it was an empty exercise in fulfilling a book contract.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|These folks make a living on fools that just can't stand the curiosity but in the end if it promises to make you a Charles Atlas with little or no effort it just ain't happening.  I love the way it starts out a section saying you just use this one exercise for 10 minutes 3 times a week and you will be super human but as you read deeper it adds more exercises and time.  It is certainly worth reading on a rainy afternoon with absolutely nothing else to do because it does have some interesting ideas although nothing new.
B000V5TV22|5.0|I didn't want to spend a lot of bucks on a GPS thingy, so I purchased this to use with my laptop. I tried it with Streets & Trips 2 days ago and it was awesome.  I seriously didn't expect it to be so accurate and it picked up 8 satellites sitting on my dash. I love this thing, and saved a ton of money by buying it.  I'm new to the GPS thing and it's amazing how such a small gadget can do what it does, and do it so well.
B00377V6J2|5.0|My title for this review says it all.  Just buy the set.  The DVD is well worth it, and the CD which I have had since 1999 is an added plus.  When I first got the CD I was floored.  I knew that Eric Clapton was a god.  But I took a new turn in my religion of the Blues when I listened to Stevie Ray and Albert King.  My vision of Blues Heaven came into focus and I was on my way to being saved.    Then I got the DVD.    It is all clear now.  If you are reading this then I know you are into the religion of the Blues.  You know who the greats are.  Nothing has changed.    But this DVD is a must own.  It is another book in the gospels of the Blues that really takes the material on the CD to another level.  Watching these two great Blues masters work back and forth, lick for lick, taking you on a magic ride in Blues Heaven.    Just buy this set, the DVD is worth it, and you have a back up CD just in case some scum borrows it and does not return it.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|A simply wonderful album. I am hesitant to name a favourite song but at the moment So Appalled is edging it, both for the perfect delivery and also for brilliant lyrical content.   Kanye's bravado and inflated esteem is part of his act and although it may rile sometimes, it should not detract from his genius. But taste in music is an entirely personal choice and no amount of claims and counter-claims will make one change his opinion. I have always been a huge Kanye fan but didnt particularly like the 808 album. This time round, with Kanye being appalled, he has fulfiled on his promise to deliver a masterpiece.  My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy gets my vote as album of the year, with Eminem's Recovery pushed into second place.
B004EAQNO4|4.0|I was losing faith in M. Night Shymalan after a string of mediocre movies. \\"The Devil\\" restores his reputation as a master of suspense, misdirection, and the well-written plot twist.

B0047ZC4O4|5.0|Loved the entire season so far. Have watched it twice and can't wait for part 2! Hope it gets a third and more seasons to tell all these awesome stories. Favourite episodes of Season 2 have been; Awakening; The Greater Good; Malice; and Resurgence.
B002X20W2E|5.0|This album was a lot of fun listening to. It was also very heartfelt, sad and beautiful: The Last Song, Cold Case Love, etc.
B0041KOVNM|5.0|I got this album about 2 weeks ago and I find myself listening to it over and over again.  If there was one word to describe this album it would be \\"Haunting.\\"  The songs just grab hold of you in a subtle way.  This is a testament to the great songwriting of Ghost.  The whole album is strong, but if I had to pick highlights it would be \\"Satan Prayer\\" and \\"Elizabeth\\" and \\"Stand by Him.\\"  This album is definitely worth buying if you like late 70's/early 80's metal; it's basically a perfect blend of BOC and Mercyful Fate.  Best album of the year, easily.
B00009W0U4|3.0|It fell short of excellent filmmaking due to the rape scene and the Rectum scene - both could have been cut in half. For instance, I didn't need to see Monica Belluci raped for 9 minutes - the scene could have been accomplished in half that time. The scene goes from shocking to just plain boring. As for the Rectum, the search for Le Tenia just took too damn long, followed by the extensive head bashing. VERY frustrating for me, as I did enjoy the film but wish it could be re-edited.    The story itself was nothing extraordinary, it was simply told in reverse. The way in which it is visually presented, however, makes for a good film.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I had been wanting this movie for awhile and was happy to find it so cheap on Amazon. I purchased the movie used although I was unsure how that would end up, and I am please to say that I recieved it in perfect condition.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Carbide and ceramic sharpeners work incredibly fast and create a balanced and even edge.  I have found that it works best when I set the sharpener on a flat surface instead of holding in my hand.  Some of my knives have thick blades and this sharpener makes quick work of them.  I haven't used the cylinder rod on a serrated edge yet.  I like that the sharpening stones are replaceable. Great purchase
1416562605|3.0|White Tiger is a story of how a nondescript boy from a village in India became an entrepreneur by murdering his employer.  Why is he not behind bars?  The answer to that question is the greater story, for in a western country, the man will be facing criminal charges.  But in India, his reward is to become an entrepreneur.  Is it the fault of the country for not pursuing its criminals?  Or the fault of the political class that shows the common people how to grab power, hold on to it no matter what, and use it in unwise ways for personal gains?  This book, in a sense, is the journey that V.S. Naipaul undergoes from his \\"An area of darkness\\" to \\"A million mutinies now\\".  In fact, Mr. Adiga's protagonist uses the term \\"darkness\\" to refer precisely to the same populace that was kept in poverty and caste-based limbo by the ruling class.  The story starts in one such area of darkness and despair and, essentially, ends up in one of the million mutinies that improves the lot of the protagonist.  Although I doubt Mr. Naipaul would condone the means (murder) of financing the mutiny.  I expected quite a lot from this book, considering it was the Man Booker winner of 2008, however, by and large I was disappointed.  To most Indians, the events described in the book would not merit a second thought, so it must be written for sensibilities of the western reader who will view with some amazement how things sort themselves out in other countries.
B000KJT8IG|2.0|First off, let me tell you that I love this movie.  It is, quite frankly, the best Christmas movie there is.  The comedy is non-stop from beginning to end.  This time of year, we watch it 3 or 4 times before Christmas, including on Christmas Eve.  Having said that, the Blu-Ray version is no better than the standard DVD.  The video is so-so, the audio is terrible (Dolby 2.0), and there are no extras.  Maybe I shouldn't expect more, after all, the movie is from 1989.  However, in releasing a Blu-Ray, I think people do expect better quality.  If you are buying this movie for the first time and can get a good deal on the Blu-Ray, go for it.  If you are thinking of replacing the standard DVD with a Blu-Ray, save your money for something else.
B00461BQC0|5.0|Despite what some people say, I think Kings of Leon get better with age.  With each album, they evolve their style slightly and I love that about them.  I think it's important for a band that plans to have a long career to keep trying to better their music, otherwise they wouldn't have enough new material to keep fans interested.  This album especially has a southern style to it, which I think has connected them more to their music, as well as makes it easier for their fans to connect.    Really, I think it's their best album yet!!

B0026GGCMG|5.0|ELP is not for everyone and everyone is entitled to their own preference of the remasters.  I find one I like and stick with it.  I really like this one.  I could not help but notice that \\"Bob\\" down below wrote a one-star review of this based upon listening to ANOTHER remastered \\"album.\\"  That is not a review, it is sales pitch for something else.  Listen first, decide for yourself.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Edit Feb-15-2011<br />Superglue did the trick. So I'm still using them. But Turtle Beach, please try to make the headphones stronger. Some metal would be nice.<br /><br />Edit Jan-24-2011)<br />They broke. It seems like the whole thing is made out of plastic so, you know how it goes, if you bend it, it might break, so be extra careful with it. Too expensive and too weak. I was afraid it wouldn't last long. So sad. I am trying to fix it with superglue.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Original Review:<br />First of all the sound quality of these is really very good. The bass boost feature makes the whole thing feel like it's trying to jump off your head.. LOL big bass!<br /><br />If you take them off you can still hear the sounds coming from it.. even from a considerable few meters away.<br /><br />They are rather comfortable even though they press against your head a bit. They are very light but the controller thing, even though it is a great addition with very useful and well thought knobs and switches, hangs from it and kind of pulls down on it if you don't clip it. That is somewhat annoying. They could make it lighter on the next version.<br /><br />Overall I feel they are a wonderful set of headphones, they work like a dream, in every platform, and I feel they will last a very fun while.<br /><br />Got them along with the Earforce DSS (merry xmas :P) and well my ears are surely happy with them!<br /><br />Oh, I also love the microphone and how you can move it around.<br /><br />They're not perfect but they're close! Hope they'll last.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|What would Christmas be without a visit to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', a story that dates back to 1843 and has been loved and read every year at this time?  There have been other films, stage productions, musicals, and family readings galore and it still holds the magic of what the spirit of Christmas is all about.  Doubtless there will be flocks of naysayers who don't buy into this adaptation by Robert Zemekis, but given the ghost story magic Dickens' created, this film takes it one step further and makes the ghostly three spirits very much alive and beautiful fanciful.<br /><br />Combining the actors with animation (animating the actors might be a better way of describing the magic) makes each of the many very well known actors who portray the characters that much more credible.  Jim Carrey is at his peak as an actor in his ability to become the illusions his mind creates: he portrays all three ghosts as well a Scrooge at every level of his history.  Other actors who are transformed by Zemekis and staff include Gary Oldman as the trio of Cratchit, Marley's Ghost, and Tiny Tim, Colin Firth as the jovial nephew, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Fionnula Flanagan and a host of others.  The costumes and scenery are brilliantly executed.<br /><br />One problem with the film that may require parental judgment is the fact that the ghosts are truly scary and children might not be able to get past the fear they instill.  But they will grow into the film as it is likely a work that will be resurrected every Christmas season as a tradition.  It is 'excellent, my good fellows'.  Grady Harp, December 10
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I'm sad that this is the end of the entire show but I am very glad that Joss Whedon was able to complete the series. Now I personally think that the show ends on the episode called \\"The Hollow Men\\". I don't like Epitaph 1 (on season 1), nor Epitaph 2 (on the last season); it felt weird for me. Otherwise I love the show. Worth having in your Joss collection.lol
1581806574|4.0|It's definitely not the only book you'd need to master the art of drawing dragons, but it does help. I'm not a great artist, and stick mostly to humans, but I saw this on amazon and had to get it. The book has tutorials on the bits and pieces of dragons (horns, wings, tails, claws), specific limbs (arms, legs, hands and feet [claws and paws]) and full body tutorials. Then full body tutorials on quite a few other mythical creatures. I only wish there had been a tutorial or two on how the legs fit onto the dragons, and the movement of the joints, but there wasn't. Still it's a fun and informative read for anyone wishing to start drawing dragons, or sharpen their skills.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|You know for years I've avoided It's a Wonderful Life simply because I was completely convinced it was just an old and horribly dated Christmas film.     Well, last night I finally watched it and... I'm really glad I did. I was wrong. It's not horrible simply because it's old. Sorry for being so close-minded and ignorant. I guess I was under the assumption such an old movie is no longer relevant in todays world, but it actually is.     It took a while for the storyline to get to the segments I REALLY had the greatest admiration for, such as when James Stewart's character was forced to learn an important lesson about respecting people (and subsequently taken to a time when nobody even knew who he was because he never existed- you'll understand this segment when you see it) *this* is when the storyline really kicked in for me.     It was a lot of fun watching James Stewart's character communicate with people he knew really well around town, however, none of those people knew him at all thanks to an angel taking him to a world where he was never even created.   It was both emotional and exciting wondering what would happen next thanks to James Stewart's reactions and facial expressions.    I really liked James Stewart's character too. He really disrespected his family for a while there, but by being shown the way of life, he learned to treat everyone around town with respect and consideration.     The entire storyline is really good so I honestly feel really bad for originally skipping over the movie so many times simply because of its age. Don't let age fool you- this my friends, is a holiday classic.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The majority of the reviews on here are spot on: this book is astoundingly good.  The most important thing to note:<br /><br />This book is horribly, horribly misclassified.  A \\"Young Adult\\" book?  Why?  Simply because the story's protagonist is a young girl?  Bad excuse.<br /><br />Though it is certainly a good read for young adults, Zusak's novel has heart-wrenching depth, dark and moving themes, and a wonderfully creative and touching story worthy to be read by all ages and backgrounds.<br /><br />To sum up: I wish there was a way to reclassify THE BOOK THIEF.  I fear a huge audience of readers is being overlooked / left in the dark because Amazon and the publisher somehow thinks it should be in the same category as THE HUNGER GAMES (also a great book, but c'mon) and the deluge of teeny, angst ridden \\"I can fix him, he's just *really* broken\\" vampire romance books that're out there.<br /><br />So if you've gotten this far in my review, yes: you gotta read this book.
B0000AGQ6Y|5.0|This version of The Professional is wonderful. It tells the story as it should have been told in its original U.S. release.     I'll never understand why the American public are treated like stupid little morons while the rest of the world enjoys great theatrical art.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|This novel seemed like it could have it all: a shocking setting, characters we could sympathize with, a daring escape, and a critical look at what it means to grow up in one's surroundings.  looking through Jack's eyes, we would learn about his tiny world, the &#34;Room,&#34; and then see what happened when it expanded.      Only, not much really happens, mainly because the inconsistent characters suddenly switch motives and patterns whenever the author decides, and the author's voice through Jack comes through as forced.  The mother goes from fiercely defending her child nightly, to sending him to what would normally have been his death, to not caring at all. There is no conclsion at the end, and little examination of why and how characters change the way they do.      In short? Its a great, but altogther wasted premise.  More time should have been spent planning what would happen after chapter 1. Just read the first chapter, then, and consider it an interesting short story; thers little more content if you read to the end.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I'd give this game a 9.9999/10, and would definitely recommend it!    ++(plusplus/reallygood):  Story  Game Play  Difficulty is good  You can skip parts you've already read    +(plus/good):  Art    -(minus/bad):  No way to change text speed (such as slow, normal, fast)(excluding skipping)  Can get a bit repetitive trying choices over and over again.    Overall, really good game. I stayed up hours doing first route. If you don't like tons of text, you might not want to try this, but again, the story is really good. It's a Visual Novel-ish type of DS game, and if you liked Hotel Dusk 215, Umineko No Naku Koro Ni, Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, Trace Memory, etc. You would probably like this game. (And vice versa.)    ((Also, cool watch. Don't expect it being easy to read the instructions/putting it on though, if you get it.))    I dunno what else I can write that others haven't so yeah.
B003XQPT9A|5.0|Even good by Muppets standards, and Cain is excellent in this move. And Amzon streaming quailty was perfect, plus the price was very reasonable at $0.99
B003A4IFDW|4.0|Bettye Lavette has a powerful voice and she uses it well in this album of covers of British rock classics.  Part of the fun of the album is that these are not the kinds of songs you'd expect an r&b/soul singer to cover.  She actually gives a blues feeling to \\"It Don't Come Easy\\"!  The strongest numbers are the covers of the Rolling Stones's \\"Salt of the Earth\\" and The Who's \\"Love Reign Over Me\\" (live from Kennedy Center).  Some of the covers are barely recognizable though (such as Nights in White Satin).  My only criticism of the album is that the songs sound a lot alike.  This is a good disc to mix in with a few others.  Listening straight through you may feel that she's just feeding tunes into a Betty Lavette machine and grinding out the same sort of solid, growling soul on each number.
B0044LK8J4|5.0|Pink Martini has given us all a great Holiday gift!  If you don't already know this band check them out.  They have given us a beautiful multicultural cornucopia of holiday music and there really is something here for everyone to enjoy!  I was playing this at work and two of my co-workers who are Chinese came running up asking where did I get the Congratualtions song?  They were delighted that I had found a song from their culture and had included it in the holiday mix!  This has gotten a lot of airplay here at home and at work, I can't recommend this enough and at $3.99 today why not give it a try?
0756966035|4.0|The Lighting Thief came as billed, a well written children's book for kids 8+ that my son has enjoyed reading and being read too. This is the first book of the series.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|I just find that anything Kinsella/Wickham writes is a fun escape from day to day grind.  It may not be her best but, I love it anyways.  Enjoy the read and enjoy Becky and Minnie
B00377V6J2|5.0|This is a reissue of an existing album with a dvd of the session that includes two extra tunes. A definite must for blues fans if you don't already have the album.  I did, but bought it for the video and was not disappointed.  Indeed, the dvd made me realize that some of the classic Stevie Vaughn licks were being covered by Albert King in an amazing performance.  This is a superb session with, to my mind, the two best electric blues guitarists of all time.  Stevie was heavily influenced by Albert, and you can appreciate it as they both play blazing solos on a number of straight ahead blues tunes.  A bit of chat between the two guitarists I could have done without, but the spirit is nice.  Absolutely first rate blues, with a good quality dvd of the session included.  Both are fun to watch: Stevie with his grimaces and Albert with his giant frame, pipe and left-handed guitar.  Great stuff!
0060555661|2.0|I know this book has a big following, but I didn't find it that useful. I went in with lots of hope of learning about how to \\"invest the right way.\\" and instead I just got frustrated with Graham and his defeatist attitude. All these people are bashing Zweig, but I found his commentary more interesting and helpful than anything Graham stated. Go to a bookstore and read Graham's comments in chapter 8 about Mr. Market. That is all this book is good for from Graham's perspective. All Graham's analysis and theories are dated since it was written 40 years ago. Also, Graham and Zweig don't tell you how to invest, instead they basically say that there is no way to predict the market, so if you want to invest, just buy an index fund. That is what I got out of this book. It seemed very negative on Wall Street and had a defeatist attitude towards investing in general in my opinion. I also found things Graham stated as contradictory. He talks about how no one can forecast the market and then later tells us ways to try to predict the value of a stock? I am not sure how that isn't forecasting? Not to mention he advocates valuing based on past results even though he says the past has no effect on the future, which is true.      \\"Don't bother with mutual funds. They don't outperform the market.\\" \\"You will probably lose a lot of money trying to invest in stocks.\\"  The book basically tries to discourage you from investing. Yes, no one can predict the future, but those who are active investors and will keep up with their investments can and have beat the market. It is those investors who do stupid things that we all know not to do like buying high and selling low that gets people in trouble, but no one should need Graham to tell them that. Patience is a virtue in investing. Also, if you can't put in the effort to check in with your FA or broker once a week or look at your stocks once a week, shame on you. It's your money. Not anyone else's. As long as investors are reasonable and realize growth can't last forever, they won't get badly burned. Everyone will lose money at some point, but get in. Ride a wave. Don't get greedy. Get out. Move on to something else. That is the way to invest. Not \\"putting your money on autopilot\\" like this book suggests. I don't know about everyone else, but I am not thrilled about getting 5% return on my 10,000 for the next 30 years.     Overall, don't buy this book. There are better commentaries on investing that aren't so defeatist and negative. This book will only discourage and bore you.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|This book was a terrible waste of money. The diet part was just another diet book, a bad and dangerous one!  A complete piece of garbage. It has been a very long time since I bought a book that I wish I could get my money back -- I feel like a sucker; the writer saw me coming!!
B0034KHFM4|5.0|I love lady gaga's songs, she's marketed as pop but she rocks just as much.  And there's plenty of listenable hits on this.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Besides the fact that this book is the best book I have ever read and I conside you read the books if you like action mystery and a little romance. But this is also the best book in the trilige in my opinion.

0385339607|5.0|My first reading of a John Grisham novel although I have enjoyed several movies based on his novels  I must say this was very good and after the first 4 chapters which took me about 2 days to complete I found myself glued to the book and unable to put it down  I will not get into the book itself but will only say I caught myself relating to the character and how in the blink of an eye your life can change and blink again and it changes again  So satisfied with this book I am now looking to read another
B001GM28HO|5.0|underneath it all she does some nice acoustic piano and singing.  there's none of that on this album, but alot of hits on it that I like.
B000002MP2|4.0|Dookie is a made up word.<br /><br />I usually don't edit reviews, but this is one of those untypical moments. Although this album doesn't really have anything positive to deliver to the public, which should actually make the prestige of \\"Dookie\\" unacceptable with regards to lyrics, the rhythms get under your skin, and like another reviewer mentioned, it does grow on you. I was quick about giving this album a chance, but I like hearing it on my stereo loudly because of its catchy sound. I just like the energetic feeling it gives me.<br /><br />Lyrically speaking, this album would be given 2 stars. The oxymoron: the rhythms are generally upbeat, but the lyrical matter is usually a downer. You hear subjects of boredum, laziness, apathy, hostility and low self-esteem; the album's booklet exhibits its lyrics. It's kinda like some rap music: the beat lures you into the material that winds up being destructive.<br /><br />Take a look at the cartoon cover. Examine it. You may be regaled. Notice in the back, Elmo is sticking out from a gathering.<br /><br />Would I suggest you listen to this album? Of course! Just don't let the lyrics get to you for the most part because they can bog you down unless you're already having a bad day.<br /><br />\\"Misery loves company.\\"
B00008RWRH|4.0|Really 4 1/2. It's great to discover \\"new\\" versions of tried and true masterpieces. Having listened to these Symphonies, especially the first 6 (which I consider far superior to the latter group) so often, with Szell's perfection in particular, Jochum had a hard act to follow. Of course, these Jochum recordings aren't new at all, having been made in the '60s. And, frankly, I have always had mixed reactions to Jochum appreciating his Bruckner and the Brahms Concertos with Gilels, but finding him a little taciturn and less than inspiring in much of the other repertoire. But these are wonderful performances, the playing is outstanding, and let's face it, the recoding is far superior to that given Szell and the Clevelanders. While some of the tempi are a bit arbitrary, and lack Szell's superhuman consistency, there is a sparkle to these renditions, and a warmth that Szell sometimes misses. The mark of a great performance is to let us enjoy and appreciate such great music that we have heard so often, with fresh ears, and Jochum excels on all counts. Papa lives!
B00122S4KS|5.0|I love all of paramore's songs and albums.  This is their first one but still has a number of recognizable hits on it.  It's a good cd.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Although the story is historically accurate, it is short on history and long on soap opera. If you want to see the day in and day out drudgeries of a handful of WWII combat Marines, complete with an abundance of details of family and love-life, along with a few very well depicted battle scenes, this is a film for you. I was anticipating more of an island hopping, battle after battle account of what it took our amphibious Marines, fliers, and our Navy fleets to drive the Japanese back to their own waters, leading to the victorious battle for Iwo Jima and eventually Okinawa and culminating in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan. I was also shocked to not see the immortal raising of the colors on Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima, the photograph of which was made famous by Joe Rosenthal, and of which a statue of the Marines raising that flag stands at the Mall in Washington D.C. and on various Marine Corps bases.  Perhaps, we'll need to research James Fahey's \\"Pacific War Diary\\" to write a film-script of the major battles and campaigns, although that is a seaman's account of the war from his ship's vantage point and doesn't reveal the struggles of Marines, in the air, on land, and sea. Other manuscripts can be culled for those details. Interest in the War in the Pacific theater of WWII never seems to wane.
1439107955|5.0|As an oncology nurse of nearly 30 years I found this biography both interesting and masterfully written. It was great to have the complex pieces of the puzzle so clearly rendered.  It reads more like a novel, and compels you to keep reading.  Wonderful tale of the history and politics of cancer management from ancient Egypt to the 21st century that exquisitely relates the human side.  Recommend to anyone who wishes to understand why the answer to this complex disease is so hard to come by.
B0024FAG1W|4.0|Great 80's movie full action, Roy Scheider was great as always, as was thw late Warren Oates. Picture and sound were top notch as well. Recommended.

9626344369|5.0|This is one of my favorite books, but what makes it a great \\"listen\\" is Stevenson's reading, which is just outstanding.  I wish she would complete the entire Austen novel set.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|These are two of the best performers of their time.  Unfortunately, the voices have started to go.  Be sure and listen to the CD that comes with the DVD to hear the artists at their best.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|I have been fascinated by this movie since the first time I watched a 12 minute 'making of' segment.  The abilities of both the actors and the director to perform in a huge gray room with suits and head gear is great talent in evidence (in my opinion of course).  I am sorry about the missing 16 minutes from the original movie.  Some of those scenes make the story line more continuous.  I was emotionally drawn in Tsu tey's death scene. I think the hunt festival dance would have shown a lot about the people.  If you are a fan of fantastic creativity, special effects, sci-fi and talent, then I recommend this set.  Seeing how the scenes were created and the 45 minutes of deleted scenes is great!
B003YWUTJI|2.0|This CD was very disappointing. Like others said there are very few tracks I enjoyed listening to. I asked for it as a gift based on previous Norah music.Too bad Amazon cannot exchange once opened.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|A fantastic live album. Really showcases how great a singer ronnie was and a great band he had (through various lineups).This cd highlights all the pomp and glory of a live metal/rock concert from years ago, with all the classics. As a diehard hard rock metal fan, this is probably the last great live album.
0452289963|4.0|When I recieved this book I was looking for something to make that \\"shift\\" in conscientiousness, I found it in this one!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is great. I bought this after going through TWO of the World of Warcraft Wireless Headsets that broke on me. They have metal where the WOW ones had cheap plastic. The range is great.. I can even walk out to my car (about 100 feet) and they still mostly work. I'm very happy with these..<br /><br />Also the new logitech software and ventrillo version work with the g keys on the headset which is extremely nice. I know some of the past reviews complained about that but they fixed it.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend these for the audiophile or the gamer.
1433502410|4.0|Excellent Bible...Many footnotes and educational addendums...Comes with an online acct. that further opens up research tools for use...decent constructed..Quite large ..Paper is quite thin so you have to be cautious when turning pages..Received it very quickly..Overall very pleased..

B00008K7AM|5.0|Great movie and very funny. Bought this one because the football field scene was filmed at my daughter's High School.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|First off I'm 36 so the original is very dear to me...but this version is better!<br />Originally saw this opening day with my son's dojo in attendance.  Great for the students.<br />Jackie Chan puts on one of his best performances; especially drama wise...my fav so far I think, and the apple is right next to both trees (I personally think Mrs. Smith is the better thespian, but the kid is great...and he is his own machine).<br /><br />Saw in a dts theater, and since this is a combo pack (real quick on that; blu-ray is the clear winner in how movies will be watched for this new decade.  If you don't own a blu-ray player or PS3, ALWAYS BUY THESE PACKS..they are the same price and you get the digital copy; then you have the blu-ray when you get a player...and you will), I watched a few minutes of the DVD just to cover all bases<br />It makes you wonder if you'll ever be able to watch a DVD again.  The blu-ray also has a cooler mix than the theater or the DVD; I don't think I even need to begin to compare quality, both picture and sound (1080p vs. 480p, and dts-HD 5.1 vs. grumply old Dolby 5.1)<br />If you liked the original, or are already considering buying this movie, BUY THIS NOT THE DVD (more bang for the same buck).<br />I think this is like 10 bucks as of this writing, for DVD, digital copy, and of course one great Blu-Ray!
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Watched the old one and had to see the new one. John Travolta  did a very good job as well as the others in the film,
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|I suspect that there will be an Iron Man 3, I just hope the story line is different next time.  Once again, it's Iron Man vs. other iron man type villians.  If it wasn't for the fact that this is about a classic comic book hero, I don't think this would have done so well.

B003UYUR10|3.0|The story line of the movie was enjoyable, but the blu-ray was horrible.  Went through two copies and then gave up.  Video constantly froze which was bad enough, but then the video went out of sync with the audio track.  Thought it was the disk, until I got a replacement and it did the same thing at the same spot of the movie.
B0031KC8OM|5.0|short lived and ended before its time.  rob thomas' smart writing and kristen bell's portrayal makes this show a little gem that was underappreciated and hugely entertaining.  Bring VM to bluray!!!

1608870081|4.0|This is a large book with quality illustrations and nice pop-up's.  The illustration of Harry Potter, however, did not look like the Harry we've grown used to seeing in the movies.  I think this book would be suitable for a young fan (4-8yrs), but might be disappointing for older children.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I just read the sample of The Lost Hero and I thought it was fantastic!I really encourage you to read it. I can`t wait to read the rest of the book.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I caught this on cable the other night.  I found myself glued to the TV!!  Both ladies' stories were well written and the actors/actresses did an excellent job!
068485743X|5.0|This book focuses mainly on the art of language. It helps me tremendously as I do not have a good ear to English which is my second language. However, judging from a lot of the manuscripts I have read by other native speakers, I can tell that the advice is really right on. I learned a lot from the chapters on sounds, voice, dialogues, progression and style. I now understand much better the difference sometimes the mere positioning of a single word can make. It is a book one can savor on and go back again and again to reference while working on a manuscript.    The only thing that bothers me in this book is that the author insists upon telling the reader how difficult it is to deal with literary agents, described as a group of overworked and grouchy people who hate their jobs. First of all I am not sure the literary agents appreciate that. Secondly as a writer, I aim to master the art of writing because I have a passion for it. I don't need to be scared into learning. To take his own advice, the author should give a bit more respect to the readers' intelligence.    Still, this is a very good book on writing and I would recommend it to anyone.
0882709194|1.0|This book was given out at my university campus. Most student didn't realize that Ray Comfort included an introduction. Ray Comfort is a christian apologetic and his arguments are patently fallacious. The juxtaposition of Darwin and Comfort seems, almost, an insult to philosophy and science.

B0042RUMG4|5.0|Kanye's CD doesn't disappoint. A few G.O.O.D Fridays tracks should have made it on there...but overall one of the best albums of 2010. Its #1 for reason.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really liked the first book in this series, with the second I lost some hope and by the third I felt I had waisted my time. It was easy to predict how this novel would turn out and I was disappointed that the story line was so focused on the main caricter. Really, everything in the world revolves around just one person? I think this novel was written in a rush and the proof readers must have had a motive for not critiquing it better.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|RIP-OFF. This is the WORST transaction I have EVER had. Ordered the stroller that should have been rushed and this accessory. After telling vendor we'd made a mistake on which order the express shipping should be on (the cost by the way was more than the actual Buggy Buddy!) I don't know who CAN'T correct an order a lousy TEN MINUTES after it was made. You people are excellent at taking money from customers with the excuse it can't be corrected. BULLLLL. As I'm sure you won't keep this one posted because you look BAD, hope someone sees it before it's pulled. Thanks for nothing.

B003W5C0VW|5.0|I wish I had seen this in the theatres when it came out. This is glorious stuff. A band at the peak of it's powers. Touring behind the greatest rock n' roll album ever. Play this loud, on a kick ass surround sound system, get yourself a good stiff long drink, give the dog a bone, and sit back, relax and watch this concert kick your butt all the way from Tallahassee to Santa Monica. I wish Mick Taylor had not made the worst decision of his life a couple of years later. He and Keith were brilliant together as you will see on this DVD. And Mick actually sings very very well!
B0041O40EI|1.0|After visiting London with the family, I thought this would be a great way for us to remember our visit and learn more about what we saw.    The puzzle was of poor quality.  The pieces are foam with the scene glued on, but not well enough to keep it from falling off.    Almost all the pieces are one of 2 shapes, so you can put together any of the pieces and they fit, making it very monotonous and impossible for more than one to work on much at a time, as you need to constantly look at the picture to know what goes where.    The old map is mostly just a tan paper with lines and almost no labels, so it seems purposeless.    The next layer was more detailed, but you feel like you've wasted a day putting together the bottom layer just to get that far.    Most of the buildings looked more like shapes/boxes than buildings, so we didn't get much out of what we were putting together.    This was a huge waste of money.  Poor quality.  Greatly disappointing.
B00192IV9U|4.0|When I heard Sony was releasing this CD of new Material by the King of Pop I was torn. Michael would never want anything to do with Sony after the way they treated him, he really felt betrayed by Sony. Granted in the past Sony did a great job promoting the Star, but hey that is simply due to the fact that Michael was creating mindblowing songs, infectiuos video's and an ultimate performer, he's any record company's dream star.    Would Michael be happy with this CD, definetely not, Michael was a perfectionist this project is far from perfect for his standards. I guess what really takes the cake is that we will never experience the total experience of a Michael release. You know what I mean, the video's, the magic, Michael himself in the flesh.     Hey but let's get back to the point at hand, Is the \\"Micheal\\" CD a Bad or Good buy? well with all said and done, I LOVE IT. Is it something worth owning? DEFINETELY, they really are great moments on this CD, it is far from the perfection that MJ sprinkles on all this work, but hey its so great to hear new songs from this Magical man.     His Voice is still on top form, granted not all the songs only one song lacks \\"Breaking News\\", but songs like \\"Behind the Mask\\" a track did in the \\"80's\\",pure genius, like electronica meets RNB POP bliss. My favourite track is written by the King himself, \\"Best of Joy\\" I can't help putting this track on repeat it's a vocal splendour, this track is pure magic, the harmonies, what this man could do with his voice. The opening track and lead single \\"Hold my hand\\" may not be my favourite but it really grows on you, Akon did good here, however not great. Lenny Kravitz's \\"I can't make it (another day), is also a gem, I love the haunting vocal on the verse, leading the rock crazed Chorus, its a simple song though, but hey sometimes less is more. \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" is also a cool song, true fans will recognise the backing vocals used on the track \\"The Hurt\\" by the Jackson 5 \\"Victory album\\", you know the ooooh ooooh oooh ooh part on the chorus, I love that harmony. \\"Much to Soon\\" a beautiful laid back vocal another beauty. \\"Monster\\" is also incredible, a great melody, beautiful vocals, so many have criticised \\"50 Cent's\\" rap, I really don't have a problem with it, I love this track.    I am happy with this CD and will cherish it, still not happy though with Sony, but hey anything to hear the King of POP do his thing. I am a true fan of Michael, it is like I have lost my big brother, but his music old and new will live on forever. I love you Michael.
0060899220|5.0|Since the turn of the Milennium, people who prepare and cook meals have reached the superstar status previously held for athletes, Hollywood types and certain politicians.  Magazines have issues trading cards, and some of the lucky ones have garnered their own television shows.<br /><br />Anthony Bourdain is one of the charismatic ones.  Travelling to faraway places, and evoking his New York attitude, he has become one of the high profile food reviewers, with an aptitude to relate to the man on the street, no matter where that street may be.<br /><br />I tore into this book with anticipation, and was not disappointed.  He began with an insiders view of how to order food, and when not to, as well.  He moved into his personal history, which was rollicking, but always dangerous.<br /><br />Heroin addiction, cocaine usage, food pilferage, and burnout are openly discussed.  Taking us to the bottom of his career, but always maintaining his humor. None of this altered my perspective, or admiration of the author in the least.<br /><br />The tales are legendary, and the story is a great read.  His rules and lessons are universal, and can be applied to the management of any business.  Recognize incompetence, and never tolerate it.  Reward vigilance and performance, and respect same, no matter who it comes from.  And always keep your sense of humor.  There are others, as well, and good ones.<br /><br />It is a cautionary tale, as well.  Bourdain loves the path he has chosen, but warns those following him not to choose it unless they are ¨all in¨.  Strong advice.<br /><br />Looking forward to perusing the follow up entrees from Mr.  Bourdain.
B002ZG9788|3.0|This is basically an action movie drawing on ancient Greek mythology.  In that regard, it's interesting that Zeus created the human race, and yet he depends on human worship for his immortality while being unable to force humans to worship. Why this dependency?  On top of that, his demigod son Perseus prefers to live as a mortal human, even though he has the choice of living as an immortal god ...<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is reasonably entertaining, though the action isn't enough to increase your heart rate much, if at all.  The special effects and scenery are good though, again, not best in class.  And the acting is likewise decent, with some well-known actors in the movie, though they don't have much to work with in terms of story or characters.  In short, not a total waste of time, but certainly not a movie I'd want to watch again.<br /><br />Last but not least, my wife picked this out as a \\"family\\" movie, but be forewarned that the level of violence is probably too much for young children (hence the PG-13 rating).
0060557818|5.0|Richard Meyhew has a good, respectable life with a good job and a fiancée. It's a typical, boring existence that he doesn't really feel any satisfaction in. His whole world is thrown into turmoil when he kindly helps a bleeding homeless girl despite the protestations of his callous and cold fiancée who would rather continue on to their important meeting than help a fellow human being. He brings the girl to his apartment and she introduces herself as Door. He then encounters two very frightening men, Mr. Vandemar and Mr. Croup, who are searching for the girl, claiming to be her concerned family. Richard continues to protect the girl and she soon leaves his life as abruptly as she entered it. The next day, he tries to go through his daily routine as usual and finds that everyone ignores him. It's as if he doesn't exist at all. His desk at work is empty and his apartment was being sold as he was in it. His only course of action is to find Door and try to get his life back. He has no idea that his journey will take him to London Below, a hidden, dark part of London that people who live above never see. It's populated by the forgotten people of Above, royalty, merchants, angels, assassins, and creatures we had all hoped were just the stuff of nightmares. Richard has to come to terms with this other world and find the hero within himself to survive.      I don't really know why it took me so long to start reading this book. It's been sitting on my shelf for over a year. I guess I figured I could always get to it later. I've read and love most of Neil Gaiman's other works and this one was no different. This is the typical story of a normal, boring guy of the modern age being thrown into a supernatural world he knows nothing about and his struggle to become a hero or die. It's a situation seen very commonly in urban fantasy, but he makes the genre his own. I became completely caught up in this world within our own. I loved that the setting was familiar, such as Harrods, with fantastical goings on. In this case, Harrods served as the place for The Floating Market, a moving bazaar for the inhabitants of London Below to sell their wares unseen by normal people. The book really sparked my interest in London's more mundane places. The writing is incredibly descriptive and elegantly written. The language flows seamlessly and just sucks you in. Sometimes I would completely lose track of time while reading. The world feels complete, but the book just couldn't encompass the whole thing. We just see what the individual characters see and some other glimpses from conversations, but it's still shrouded in mystery at the end of the novel. To me, this is a strength of the novel that it can be expanded upon and the novel is just a small slice of the larger picture.    I truly loved or loved to hate all of the characters without exception. All of them had their own complete stories. I never knew if the secondary characters where on Door and Richard's side or not until the very end. My favorite character was Richard because he started out as a boring businessman with no sense of adventure and grew into so much more because of his exposure to this other dark and savage world. He thought his life was pretty wonderful at the beginning, but he later realizes that his fiancée is a cold person who wishes he were someone else and his job just makes him into a mindless corporate automaton. I really enjoyed following his hero journey throughout the novel.    Neverwhere is a richly imagined urban fantasy that takes the familiar and makes it distorted and dark. I highly recommend it to just about anyone.
B00453YBE4|2.0|Despite the warnings of other reviewers, I downloaded Made of Metal with hopes that it would somehow be Resurrection-Part 2. Instead I got what others had warned about: weak songwriting and what sounds like a halfhearted attempt at metal. I can't put my finger on what's missing, but \\"it\\" definitely is. Made of Metal is a disappointment. We've come to expect better from you, Rob.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had seen all these movies at the theater and on regular dvd but these Blu-Ray versions are something that needs to be seen as words don't do the movies justice. Just take my word; Buy this, you won't be disappointed
B0040JHWKS|2.0|I have only listened to it twice   but it generally sounds like melancholy whining, nothing like I had hoped for. It reminded me of neil youg singing about his dead grandfather.  I will try to sell it without copying it. There were one or teo cuts that got my head bobbing but that's it. Not my cup of tea.  Definitely NOT \\"Born in the USA\\" material !!
B003E8P9G0|2.0|this book was a dull book compared to the percy jackson series although i recently had an egypt unit and some of the facts that were in this book were helpful for studying but overall it was not an exciting book.
B002ZG999U|5.0|i LOVE this movie, i cant get enough of it. a simple 80's action movie formula and it works to this very day. im just sad for the people who turned down starring roles in this fine film such as van damme, kurt russell, steven seagal, and others.
B003XRZZFM|4.0|Dimmu Borgir is one those bands that just grow on you. I have just about all they have put out and till here recently I listened to them every once in a while. But here lately I keep at least 2 of their cds in the stereo all the time. I just like the sound they have overall. Some have called them 'sell outs'. I call it getting better and more mature. This album proves this band although still keeping the evil overture has the ability to vary in different ways giving them a wide range of sound and creativity. If nothing else Dimmu Borgir is not boring and repetitve like other bands are guilty of. Sure you know it is them but the theatrical sound mixed with the hellish vocals gives this band a step above if you ask me. In my opinion they stand alone in their genre. This album proves they still reign in black metal for superb production,great sound,and an elaborate theatrical sense of creativity following the evil and hell they are known for. I'm not a big fan of most black metal but Id recommend this and other Dimmu Borgir albums to anyone who likes evil sounding music mixed with hellish vocals that stuns the listener with a sense of darkness and all hell.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|nice
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Loved this movie in keeping with the holiday spirit!...It was visually and audibly stunning!!....Jim Carrey and the rest of the cast did an amazing job with the motion capture technology. This will be shown annually (Christmas-time) in my house!
0316067938|1.0|The day i read this book was the day I almost went bald. The first book was good, the second was decent and then the third was good as well. Now I have to talk about the fourth.    I always like books and there are few exceptions.....this is one. The book had absoulutly NOTHING to do with the other books except the fact that it shares the author. The series is mainly about Edward and the cullens struggling to keep bella safe and edward struggling for bella's complete love. But this book doesn't follow.     I can't even read the whole book through. the first time i read it it took me two days(I usually finish a book in one) and I felt angry after. then I tried reading it again and i threw it at my bedroom wall and didn't pick it up until a week later.    The book was also ridicuolus, Renesmee and jacob, no way. For one thing, it's idiotic, Leah would have been a better choice(if they'd been the same age) yeah, yeah Jacob needs someone since he realized there was no chance with Bella but her daughter, an infant, no way. Also jacob needs someone to argue with not walk around like a little puppy. You can tell Renesemee is going to be a quiet, calm girl and jacob needs a fiery one, a girl with temper but who can calm him down, Jacob looses that with Renesemee. I really thik she's going to leave him for some vampire.    Another thing, the honeymoon is all about.....SEX,SEX,SEEEEEEXXXX!!! it's kind of tiring how many \\"Headboards they break\\". It's a kid's book and even third graders are reading these books. She really needed to keep the sex to a minimum. i didn't want my little cousinlearning how babies are made but now he knows.
0307739961|5.0|If you haven't read Larsson's first two books you have missed an intriguing part of this series. He is such a different and well written writer. It is a shame he will no longer entertain us with his inspiring books.
0340766166|5.0|Like many other people, I first encountered \\"Shogun\\" some years ago via the superb mini series that came out in the late '70's with Richard Chamberlain in the principal role as Captain-Pilot Blackthorne, the unhappy English leader of a desperate band of Dutch sailors shipwrecked on the coast of 16th century Japan - then a land virtually unknown to the outside world. The wonderful and detailed depiction of what was then a totally alien yet fascinating and incredibly complex culture made me want to find out more, so I acquired a copy of the novel -and a timely bout of flu enabled me to thoroughly absorb myself in the 1100 plus pages of this remarkable landmark work.    Many people may or may not be aware that Mr Clavell has had a long and complex relationship with the Far East. He suffered the full cruelties of the brutal Japanese conquest of South East Asia during the last war (see his book \\"King Rat\\", a direct reflection of life in the notorious POW camp of Changi), and despite all he suffered still maintained a respectful and remarkably insightful view of the Japanese people, their culture and their history and traditions. However, as depicted throughout \\"Shogun\\", the early European explorers of the Elizabethan era naturally had no such insight, and indeed (initially anyway)come across as the ignorant, filthy, coarse and undisciplined \\"barbarians\\" the Japanese undoubtedly took them for. But the Europeans for their part were equally baffled by their resentful hosts - they found themselves in a beautiful yet savage land where life and death were intertwined as one, where acts of appalling cruelty blended with remarkable sensitivity to refinement and art and where the genteel masked an almost incredible indifference to those the upper classes considered beneath them - this underclass is called \\"Eta\\" in Japanese. It is also by chance that Blackthorne and his companions stumble into this alien world during a period of massive political upheaval and where the great feudal lords of Japan are vying fiercely for the vacant role of Shogun - the supreme ruler of Japan, answerable only to the Emperor, who in reality has very little political power. Although most unwanted outsiders are immediately put to death, a couple of forward thinking samurai lords (the sadistic but wily Lord Yabu and his very capable and intuitive nephew, Omi) realise that the new arrivals have much needed knowledge of the outside world they do not, that could tip the balance of power throughout the whole country, and so spare their lives. However, the presence of the outsiders comes to the attention of the two greatest semi-royal nobles - Toronaga (based on the real life 16th century magnate, Tokugawa)and his deadly rival, Ishido. Both men have caused the country to divide into two warring camps and would also do anything to get their hands on Blackthorne and his priceless knowledge of ships and modern warfare. However, the brilliant and open minded Toronaga seeks to nurture and benefit by Blackthorne's substantial abilities - Ishido, bitter and firmly entrenched in superstitious tradition and hate, seeks only to destroy him. Blackthorne for his part needs all of his considerable resources of courage, linguistic skill, tact and diplomacy to weave his dangerous and complex path down the path of Japanese politics if he is to achieve his ultimate goal - to have his own wrecked ship, the \\"Erasmus\\", made seaworthy once more and to attack the mighty Black Ship - the Portugese trading vessel that regularly ferries a fortune in spices, gold and silks from the Orient back to Catholic Spain. This is a monopoly Blackthorne knows Queen Elizabeth of England would pay anything to achieve, and he means for England to achieve that right over their bitter enemy.    There is something in this epic novel that should cater for any serious reader. The viciousness of samurai battle is offset by the remarkable finesse of daily Japanse living, but the ever present threat of very real danger is there in every page. The snakepit of medieval Japanese politics permeates every twist and turn throughout the novel, which is startling in its depiction of a very advanced but brutal society. Mr Clavell's greatest triumph in this reviewer's opinion is his in-depth crafting of the characters, enabling the reader to truly understand the Japanese mindset as they may never be able to elsewhere. The reader may not always like or agree with what they read in the way of characters' opinions, but one can certailny understand them better and on occasion even admire and respect their single minded dedication to a set course, irrespective of the often terrible personal cost. Toronaga, although thoroughly ruthless, comes across as a truly far-seeing, brilliant, understanding and not unjust man with genuine hints of greatness in his character that Blackthorne comes to recognise and greatly respect. But he also comes to respect and deeply love the Lady Mariko, an unofficial interpreter and adviser to Toronaga who is unhappily married to one of his best generals. Mariko's intellect, sensitivity and bravery matches her considerable beauty and it partially through her wisdom and tuition that Blackthorne achieves what no other Westerner has ever done - the coveted rank of Samurai.    This is arguably one of the best depictions of medieval Asia one could ever read. Allow time to thoroughly absorb yourself in the pages as there is a lot to take in and understand. But it is truly well worth the time and effort!
0316017922|3.0|The book in a nutshell claims that ability won't make a person successful. The person also needs to be in a situation that allows him/her to become successful. In other words, given the RIGHT chance, talented people succeed. Without the right chance, a person won't \\"pull himself up by his bootstraps.\\"    Gladwell isn't an academic. It's obvious from reading his book. He believes that certain things don't get published in peer-review journals for being \\"too weird.\\" He also loves using anecdotal evidence to prove his point. He says very little while using a lot of words. Succinct he is not. He relies too much on tests and IQ scores.    The book is an interesting read. I'd recommend people to go to the library and read it. Don't buy this book.
0061968579|1.0|I am very disappointed that this is a comic book. I had no way of knowing till I received it. I am going to try to exchange it.
B000B7BRMM|2.0|Sorry, Diana.  As much as I like your piano ... and voice ... this one doesn't make it.  I assume it was the Producer, rather than you, who told you to clip the ends of words.  That works in upbeat stuff, but not sentimental - and Christmas time!  Still I love your piano and wish there were more!
B003GDYN24|5.0|This cd is awesome! I love Kelis and think she is an underrated artist to begin with but this album is pure fire. Dance music at it's finest. I thought for years Kelis should do more dance music and thought she would be a great match for this genre, and she is! If she had started out in this genre 10 plus years ago, she probably would be a lot more successful. Anyway, awesome amazing album. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0670034711|1.0|If you are seeking advice for how to deal with difficult situations in your life or how to \\"find God,\\" this may be the book for you. However, I don't recommend getting this advice from Elizabeth Gilbert. Unless you happen to have a spare $200,000K laying around so you can (conveniently) travel around the world on a self-absorbed journey, don't trouble your time and efforts with reading this book. Plus, unless you are interested in Miss Gilbert specifically and not an anonymous woman who travels the world looking for God, this is not for you. Miss Gilbert really puts the \\"me\\" in memoir.    This is one woman who really needs a reality check. Millions of people around the world suffer through hardships greater than Miss Gilbert's every day. I want to see what she would do if faced with poverty, starvation, death, genocide, war, cruelty, or any other of the vast numbers of hardships multitudes of people are forced to deal with on a daily basis. Miss Gilbert has friends, family, a fat purse, psychiatrists, delicious food, Yogic Gurus, and strong Brazilian men to help her through seemingly difficult and troublesome, yet in the grand scheme of things, petty, situations such as divorce and lost love from ex-boyfriends. Probably collapse in a bathroom - and hopefully feel grateful for what she has.    True, reading about a woman who overcame her internal struggles by eating food and living in Italy (anyone's dream, right?), meditating in India (a luxury many can't even dream about), and finding love in Indonesia (a perfect chick-flick movie fantasy) are inspiring for those who want to be inspired. However, for most of us out there, this could never begin to be a reality. And instead of suffering through three hundred pages of over-indulgent, self-absorbed whining and self pity just to be disappointed in the end because you know the same thing could never happen to you, just save yourself the trouble and pick a different book. Chances are, instead of finding inspiration or enlightenment from reading this book, you are more likely to find yourself wanting to slap a reality check and backbone into Miss Gilbert and become more depressed and frustrated with your life than you were before, not to mention lose your desire for spirituality.     Don't waste your time reading this book. There are many others out there that offer the same message in a thought-provocative, inspirational manner that doesn't make you grit your teeth in frustration and annoyance.
B002C1BHIO|4.0|I did a reasonable amount of reading, discovering, it appears, that, regardless of price, most HDMI cables are going to perform very well.  I could have picked one for less money, but I opted for this one [the ratings were mostly high], and I returned one to Best Buy [double this price].  I am using it with a Yamaha tuner and a Samsung 40\\" LCD TV; picture and performance look great, and the cable appears to work just fine.  Not sure I love the fabric feel of the covering. Fished it through a wall and had to spend a little time cleaning it off.   Bottom line:  I agree there's  not a lot of reason to spend the big bucks.
B00448SE4S|1.0|I wanted to like this movie.  Appreciation for comic-book culture: check.  Appreciation for video-game culture: check.  Appreciation for well-crafted irony: check.  Little did I suspect that after my wife and I decided to rent this movie for a quiet night together, we would spend the entire playing time wishing (a) that we had rented something else, and (b) that we could punch Michael Cera in his whiny, emasculated face until he promised never to act again.  If it had cost more than $3 I would be requesting a refund.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the problems with reading Ender's Game in 2010 is that so many good and bad science fiction books and movies have come and gone that riff or ripoff the themes present in this novel that the original now seems cliched and dated, much like a lot of Heinlein seemed to me when I was a boy. If you are going to read Ender's Game, you're going to have to put it in its historical context and remember that this was the beginning of a thread that soon followed.    Also I would recommend the next sequel to complete the tale: Speaker for the Dead, where Ender deals with consequences of his actions. The rest of series are little more than filler.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had this headset for a while now and i like it a lot but there are a few things that need improving for instance the batteries powering the headset vary on how long you play and if you have bass boost on. i like having bass boost on everything but on this headset i recommend not using it because it cuts your battery life by half. i recommend using rechargeable battery's because Ive gone through so many disposable battery's. on average the battery life on my headset is short because i use it everyday for video gaming, watching TV, and playing on the computer. I use this for long periods of time on average of 18 hours or less its so comfortable you wont even feel it on the sound quality is amazing although i do get a few popping noises and distortion but it doesn't happen too often id rate this product a 5/5 on comfortableness 5/5 for sound quality 2.5/5 for battery life; but for the price its worth it! for me it was an easy out of the box installation no need for instructions unless your new to the gaming era. well that's all Ive got to say pick up yourself an X41 headset and get to gaming!
0439023521|4.0|My daughter suggested I read this and I ended up ordering all three in the series. Well written and sometimes thought-provoking young adult book that adults will enjoy as well.
B00415ZW58|5.0|Jerry Yan and Ella Chen headline a stellar cast in this romantic comedy/drama set in Taipei and Hangzhou.  Many of the subplots and character portrayals remind me of what might be found in the poetry and plays of William Shakespeare and the novels of Jane Austen, but Down With Love stands on its own as an original work that reinterprets familiar themes in an entertaining and refreshing way.  I hope GTV and Taiwan will continue to share their national treasure of acting talent with their growing fan-base in California.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is an amazing, feel-good read. Not only is this a character driven novel, that is funny, and light, but Ms. Perkins makes the city of Paris a character in and of itself. I couldn't put the book down and recommend it to teens and adults alike.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|The movie is a 'feel good'/ hey I recognize that face! experience.  It doesn't drag and is not predictable or trite.  Once again, Meryl Streep morphs into a role that fits her like a second skin.  You vacilate between identifying with the younger generation and then the older generation and its a great feeling.  Watch this with anyone!  Your kids, spouse, youth group, whoever.  This is a movie to be shared and enjoyed again and again.
B00192IV9U|5.0|It was very moving for me to hear this. It's almost as though he were still here. I think the producers did a great job on the mixing but if your familiar with Michaels music you will know it is mixed.But Michael sings from his heart as always and overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B0042816YK|1.0|I only watched the entire movie because I spent the money to rent it. I was completely disappointed and bored. I was relieved when it was over. Even Julia Roberts couldn't improve on the shallowness of the characters. I completely agree with cinemagirl's review.
B00030590I|5.0|Desde hace mucho tiempo quería comprar la película por muchas razones: la fotografía, la música, la historia, las actuaciones... Es poesía convertida en película. Sin duda alguna, de mis favoritas.    En Amazon la encontré en un precio excelente, imposible de superar.    DEBEN ver esta pelicula!
B003NHRIVQ|1.0|I was looking forward to see this movie but it was a disappointment. The storyline was good, but the acting just didn't do it for me. The acting wasn't compelling or believable. For one, Ronnie gets upset at her boyfriend and says \\"I don't want to be another girl in your parade of girls\\" (cheesy line) and then the next minute he grabs her and kisses her and POOF her attitude is gone. Not to mention how quickly the guy got over it when he was telling Ronnie his sob story. In addition, the attempt of humor with her father's remark about his creepy smile was weak. I thought this would be a lot better.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Excellent quality - - i am not a big country fan but their songs really hit the heart and the music was so tight. Made me a big fan. Cant wait for them to produce another album.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I got this set for Christmas, and my reaction was and remains \\"WOW!\\" I won't go into an album by album analysis of the mono set as that's been covered sufficiently in other reviews.  What I will say is that the mono is more organic than the stereo mix; one's attention is fixated to the music as a whole rather than the left/right panning tricks utilized in the stereo mixes.  The mono simply sounds \\"right\\" where the stereo leaves me feeling as if I'm listening to something artificial.  Granted, I didn't feel that way prior to getting this set, but it now feels weird listening to the stereo mixes after hearing the mono.  Certainly, the mono reveals an even higher level of musicianship than that which appears in stereo; Ringo, in particular, is portrayed much more up front and powerful in the mono versions. That's how the boys wanted it since they were intimately involved in the mono production while leaving the stereo \\"monkeying around\\" to the engineers. Also, there is an immediacy to the mono mix which is conspicuously absent from the stereo. This is an essential set for any Beatles fan.
B001GQSY64|4.0|First off I thought this was going to be the worst aspects of star wars dumbed down for kids consumption.<br />While there are those elements they aren't anywhere as bad as the movies.<br />Granted the Asokha (sic) is fairly annoying she couldn't hold a candle to whiny Anikan.<br />I was reluctant to get it due to the various complaints I had heard. I felt I would be lost if I got the series and didn't have the movie.<br />What I found is that the themes that carry through all the Star Wars franchise are here. The whinny kid apprentice is the main one I was afraid of.<br />Makes me wonder how George really feels about teens and pre-teens. I'm aware that the movie had a fairly heavy hand of Lucas involved. I also know that as the series progressed he wasn't as involved. So I hope this was helpful and cleared up some of the same issues or misconceptions about the movie as I had if you are on the fence regarding this purchase.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|This movie is amazing if you like movies like saw where you never know who's the killer within the group of people. This is a must watched , had me guessing the whole time.
0060558121|4.0|An awkward title for a review, however, appropriate for a book that has so much going on. A novel that touches on fantasy, drama, crime, history, adventure, and mystery too. This story, \\"American Gods\\", is typical Neil Gaiman fare. Unlike others I find no difficulty when this sort of writing requires you keeping track of the many interlocking events and myriad characters, and, I rather enjoy this style of story telling as putting it all together, for me, is part of the fun of reading. I enjoyed the first few hundred pages of the book best and also the ending which was much to my liking as reality reared its head and, I think, provided some needed grounding. Mr. Gaiman, too, was tidy in wrapping it all up and providing closure for the reader. But, there was a bit when the storm approaches and the protagonist, Shadow, proves himself, that I found somewhat lacking and troublesome. All in all the story kept my interest and I came away somewhat satisfied. Just missing four stars though.
B004856SQ8|5.0|I watched the A-Team as a young lad and was afraid to see this movie because I loved the show so much.  When the reviews came in I decided to take a chance and order the blu ray.  The film was everything I wanted and more.  It was the A-team.  The characters were the same.  Everything I wanted from this movie was there.  If they ever plan to make a second I will be ordering my tickets and DVD months in advance. This film was perfection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is probably the best book i have ever read. not to long ago i fimmeshed the series. It beimg completely over saddened me very much. Suzanne Collins is a very talented writer and she demonstrares that exquisitely in the breath-takimg series.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I absolutely love this boxed set, the quality is great; and I disagree with the previous reviewers who were critical of same.  The audio quality is more than adequate, and the boxed set presentation is more than I would have hoped for.  I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my mother, since she really loved that show (me, too, actually)! We have been able to watch Seasons 1 and part of 2 together and -- best of all -- commercial-free and uninterrupted, picking up on little tidbits we may have missed during the original series years ago.  For all you fans of \\"The West Wing,\\" I give it a 10!  - Diane Ludwig-Judson

B00005JKNF|3.0|its only downfall is that its a long movie, but a solid plot - a little slow at the beginning, but once you get through that, the storyline just sucks you in.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The MONO BOX SET is the most beautiful gift. You've got a careful edition with sleeves like original LP in miniature. The sound is brilliant and powerful, but the best, of course, is the quality of songs. You may listen the first period of the Fab Four like they did it originally. And really amazing the second age, psychedelic and art rock, from Pepper, perhaps, from Revolver, until White Album, the last Mono Album of the BEATLES.    THE MONO REMASTERED BEATLES is a collection of jewels, from gold of youthfulness to diamond of maturity. The rainbow of melodies, the ocean of vocal harmonies, the winds of guitars and drums (Always the underrated Ringo, so important for the music of the band), the truth of the art and the joy of life, la joie de vivre. The Beatles are the light into the dark times, the word into the noise we live.
0312370849|5.0|Riviting story but too much emotion went into the main character's personal life.  Sarah's life was tormented by what she experienced and left her scared and that was what kept you turning the pages to find out what was happening next.  I enjoyed the book a lot.
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|Purchased these boots as a present for my mother and she loves them.  She normally wears 8.5 or 9 and I purchased the 9.  They fit well, she has worn them in snow, and they are very comfortable.  The boots look nice and are easy to clean.  I normally wear a 9 and tried them on as well, and they would have plenty of room for socks.  Maybe order a size up if you want to wear 2 pairs of socks or extremely thick socks, but they seemed pretty true to size for both of us.  Hope this helps!
B000GQOTBO|5.0|I've read this book in my teens, 20's, 30's, and now my 40's and I still think it's one of the best books i've ever read.
0316077054|1.0|There have not been many books that I have reviewed with a one star rating, I usually just let it be and tell myself that people can find out for themselves. This book however was so dreadful, that I just had to warn others of it.    While beautiful creatures (at least the beginning) isn't bad, I quite recall now that this also was one that I wouldn't have rated high. Why did I read the sequel? Call it stupidity or just curiosity, but in short: I did read it and I am quite sorry I did.    The universe of this book is so badly drawn up, that a 10 year old could do a better job creating it. There are no rules what so ever, rules are made as the writers go along into a story line so crazy, it doesn't make any sense. While most good fantasy books have a set of rules that the world has to abide by, the writers just come up with new rules and new creatures and new bends, all so that the main characters can conveniently get further onto their path. Rules are also broken, again and again and our main characters are \\"coincidentally\\" always that special that it doesn't matter.  The coincidences are too much to bare, every other page a new secret is revealed (that always makes sense to Liv, one of the most pathetic characters if I ever met one.. She's like a horribly written Hermione). Every other chapter the characters take ages to get to a new location, only to find out that somehow the people on their side are already there (sigh.. how they got there is of course never explained). No one asks any questions, everyone seems to be in on the plot and the whole book long I had the feeling the main character would wake up just to find out he was in some sort of crazy dream. The repetitiveness of silly quotes like \\"there are only a few in the world\\", \\"that is so rare\\", \\"only you can do this\\" and other cliches get boring after the first few chapters and it only gets worse.    The biggest pain is that this book had potential. Its predecessor had great characters, that were kind of interesting and could have had a good storyline, but in this book there was zero guidance of any editor and I am still surprised something like this even got published.    My advice? Get another series to read, one where you don't feel that the authors are talking to a public of 5 years old, but actually create a world with certain rules before they randomly start writing.

B0044KU7KU|2.0|MCR is always an iffy buy. This time, like their first album, it wasn't that great. The songs were all so similar, distinguishing is hard, other than one or two of the singles, like on Helena. Just buy the singles...
B003UBTX7C|2.0|I've read all of Baldacci's books and he is in my top 5 favorite authors.  This book disappoints.  The plot has unexplained twists and turns.  Characters fail to communicate in very frustrating ways, always getting them in more trouble in the twisted plot.  You never say... \\"Gee, this could happen\\", because it is too far fetched.  I'll read his next book, but if it is like this one, he drops out of my top 100 favorite list.

0793518326|4.0|The best Beatle music book yet. Extremely accurate. Captures the  harmonic texture that was is unique to their music.   My only beef is that the scores are difficult to read because the print is so small.  If the publisher was wise they would print an edition about twice as large. I would be willing to pay for a larger edition.
0525423273|4.0|First up I need to say that I loved this book. It made me want to visit Paris, eat the food, watch movies and make a wish. It also made me want to attend SOAP (School of America in Paris) where Anna is shipped off to in order to complete her senior year. The secondary characters are well thought out and they help create the atmosphere around the leads, Anna and Etienne. Anna deals with homesickness, rejection, betrayal and loneliness and still remains relatable and likable and I found myself wanting to walk in her shoes.    Stephanie Perkins has created totally realistic and loveable characters and a world that makes you wish you were there. Although the book is quite predictable (I found myself guessing what was going to happen next a few times) it still is a very enjoyable read and I'll definitely be reading it again. My only disappointment with Anna and the French Kiss is that it ended as I wanted to know what happens with Anna and Etienne up to and through College. Overall the book was very easy to read and the language was very believable and captured teenagers perfectly, although I did notice that a few characters acted quite childish considering they're supposed to be 18.    So if your looking for a quick and easy read with cute boys, kissing and a setting in the most romantic city in the world then this book is for you. I've got my fingers crossed Stephanie writes a sequal and I can't wait to read her next book.    [...]
B003ZIZ2HK|5.0|If so this is, at the moment, THE version to get. It's absolutely perfect in every way as far as a BD release goes. I was also really surprised at it's being limited to only 10,000 copies being made with a COA included with each.     The movie itself is the best I've ever seen it. I'm just a dumb American who has bought a few copies hoping for both a good video picture and accurate subs...I've only had the former and never the latter. So when I got this in and watched it...it was almost like seeing a totally new movie. I actually KNEW what they were saying. I no longer think the Japanese are as weird as I once did. Seriously, if someone said \\"You've got to survive!\\" the copies I've had in the past would either not have anything in the subs or something like \\"Don't trouble the underwear!\\".     That alone is worthy of a purchase.    As far as importing it, I'd suggest it. Even if the American release from Anchor Bay is virtually the same set...it's still cool having this numbered version. I mean, really, ten thousand is like nothing.     Oh, all the BTS stuff has been remastered and re subtitled as well, same reaction there. Just perfect execution. My only 'real' complaint is that it's the size of a dvd box so it towers over other BD cases on the shelf. But who cares? It should!     Oh also, the comic that comes with it \\"Parents Day\\" is a pretty excellent prologue to the movie.       GET THIS RELEASE!
1601251831|5.0|Well done...<br />A perfect supplement for the Pathfinder RPG and also it is a very useful sourcebook for all kinds of D&D games. You will not regret to purchase it...
0756665949|3.0|In terms of content, you quite simply can't beat this book. But Damon and Carlton, ABC, the authors, publishers and all others associated with \\"The Lost Encyclopedia\\" should be completely embarrassed by the lack of copyediting in this book. I've never picked up anything like it. Occasionally in a book you find one or two errors, but this is riddled with them - grammatical errors, spelling errors, identical sentences, missing words. It's ridiculous that this book ever made it to publication. Where's the copy editors? Where's the quality control? Did anybody even read over the final copy once? My casual browsing has picked up 20+ errors...it's hard to believe that, had one or two decent copyeditors been hired, such blatant errors would ever make it to publication. DK should be ASHAMED of itself.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|It's an incredible tale full of travel, adventure, love, fate, and friendship. Your life is not complete until you read this enchanting story, which is sure to captivate your heart and mind.

Not to be missed. You will wish for more.
0792843584|1.0|Time to make not one, not two, but three confessions.<br /><br />1. I have tried to make it past the first hour many times, and just barely made it past the third as of recently. It wasn't easy- good thing I had a pot of coffee nearby.<br />2. I absolutely hated the Deer Hunter. Thought it was complete garbage as with any Michael Cimino film.<br />3. I believe anyone who has sit through even 5 minutes of this cinematic abortion deserves a big cheque from Cimino himself as an apology.<br /><br />Don't listen to the people who call this film a masterpiece. I don't know what they're snorting, and I certainly don't want any of it, especially if it dumbs them down enough to make them call this film a masterpiece.<br /><br />Don't get me started on how long each scene is. The 20 minute dance scene in the beginning will make you go \\"OK is it done yet????\\". Or the 5 minute shots of people staring off into the distance. I don't mind movies starting off slowly, as long as the time is spent to set the tone. I'll mention Inglourious Basterds here- the opening scene is 20 minutes long and consists of a conversation at a table between a Nazi and a Jew. However, it's there for a reason. It's a scene in which miss a single line of dialogue, and you will not get the film. It does an excellent job at setting the tone and having the audience on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />To say this movie moves at a slow pace is really wrong- it doesn't move at any pace at all. It just sits on its arse and expects the audience to help it move. That's not to say that nothing happens, because plenty happens- too bad only 10 minutes of it are actual content. There's a difference between epicness and length. The entire dialogue could fit onto maybe 3 sheets of paper, and back to back too. And whatever dialogue was there, it wasn't even interesting at all.<br /><br />The movie even looks like crap too. Half the film is shot in Sepia- this takes 2 seconds to get annoying, and by the third hour, it you'll be needing to see an eye doctor. This is just a horrible film, and one that should be avoided. The quote on the back of the DVD is right too- \\"A Remarkable Achievement\\". I'm only sure the full quote was \\"A remarkable achievement in boring its audience to death\\".ust a horrible film, and one that should be avoided.

6304711905|2.0|When \\"Tombstone\\" begins, you think you're watching an 80 years ago amateur's attempt at a home movie by your grandpa.  What's happening of course, is old school mentality says a western has to make the bad guy as evil as possible so the audience has no pity for the bad guy when it's his time to be killed off.  \\"Tombstone\\" takes that to the most extreme I think I've seen in over a decade, but for as hard as they try, they just don't get the job done.  The producer and director are trying to give the audience a sense of the past misdeeds of the Clanton and the McClaury gang, using technique.  No sale, try something else in your next film, okay?  Kurt Russell helped direct this film and I guess this was just too early in his career to be experienced enough to know what works and what doesn't.<br />More and more, Hollywood makes justice and due process of the law to seem as equally evil and wrong as the criminal element.  Brutality for brutality, and yet done in a manner that portrays it isn't so much revenge as it is a reckoning.  The outlaw gang has an extended family adherence apparently, and the last quarter of the movie shows the marshal posse gunning them down like this movie was trying to beat a Bruce Willis movie for body count.  The story has for the most part ended before these events, and then has to go back to where the story left off.  Peppered into the stew is the poignant passing of Doc Holliday in a hospital bed in Colorado.  That sanatorium segment could have been left out entirely.  Seriously.<br />Well, Val Kilmer does a fair portrayal of Doc Holiday, although for all the sincere effort Kurt Russell puts into the role of Wyatt Earp, Kurt just isn't convincing.  Sam Elliott was throttled too far back.  This version of the events of the city by the movie's name, would have been a much better story if Sam Elliott had been cast in the lead.  Kurt Russell belongs in action, adventure, or sci-fi; but would be better off leaving westerns to other actors.  In those other genre, Kurt Russell has impressed me over and over again.  This time not so much.<br />I was surprised to see Charlton Heston in this movie in just a cameo role.<br />Michael Biehn does a great job in the role of Johnny Ringo; one of the bad guys.  His meeting at the big oak with Doc Holliday is the best part of this whole film.<br />I can't give this movie 5 stars.  My opinion is there was just something not quite right about this film, and I'm leaving historical accuracy out of it.  Something just wasn't kosher.<br />Most of the big names that should have been prominent were almost in obscurity by contrast.  Michelle Beauchamp only has about 4 minutes of screen time.  Billy Bob Thornton is a casino table dealer in a saloon.  Stephen Lang was great in \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\" and in \\"Gettysburg,\\" but in this version of \\"Tombstone,\\" his role as Ike Clanton is another one of those casting problems that simply doesn't work convincingly.  Dana Delany is lovely in her role as Josephine Marcus, but that sure could have been expanded upon.  BTW, the \\"R\\" rating is for violence, not for nudity or sexual situations.<br />Overall, this movie was much choppier than it had to be, and doesn't have the continuity to make it superior to \\"Wyatt Earp\\" with Kevin Costner.  Casting and emphasis in \\"Tombstone\\" is simply off the mark.  Should have been a lot better, the cast had enough talent; but apparently in the wrong place.  I'm glad I bought this DVD used.

B00192IV9U|5.0|This is a beautiful gem of an album. I love every track. It is wonderful to be listening to these amazing and inspiring songs that (except for \\"Hold My Hand\\") I have never heard before. I think that Michael would have wanted to share these songs with us. I don't think that any one, especially Michael Jackson, would have created something as beautiful as this and not share it, simply because he could not be there to complete it. It appears that many who have listened to the album agree that it is Awesome, and I think that it is perfect as it is.    I would like to see a \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" video with the imagery of Michael singing to the us from heaven. I don't know how this could be achieved artistically, but I think it would be out of this world. Long live the King... We love you Michael! You inspire me in all I do. Thank you!    `Dougie'
B003L20ICE|2.0|(might be a spoiler if you know nothing about the movie - then don't read!)    First I have to say all of the actors turned in top notch performances inspired by a worthy director. These all are characters one comes to care about, in spite of their flaws.    Now the disappointment - what happens between Paul & Jules simply was not believable - lesbian women certainly are capable of cheating but not likely with a straight man. And Jules is too old to not be sure about her identity - she says several times she's gay, not bi.    Even if I allowed for the possibility Jules might be drawn to Paul, the reaction of all the characters toward Paul was nothing but mean-spirited. I wasn't looking for a fairy tale, but if Jules deserved forgiveness - which she did, as her partner was a bit much to take at times, then Paul also deserved forgiveness, especially from his children.    The problem? This movie wasn't sure if it wanted to be a comedy or a melodrama. I am glad I saw it, though I wished I'd turned it off about 20 minutes before the ending.    The best scenes were with all of them together, just being an unconventional family who actually liked each other. Why couldn't the author have seen that was a much more interesting and important message than yet another movie dealing with couples' cheating?     One more great scene that made the movie worth seeing: Annette Bening singing a Joni Mitchell song!    The performances made it a two star rather than one star movie. Boo to the author for not having faith unconventional families can exist -- and work quite well, thank you very much! There was no need to end the movie with a mean-spirited note.     See it for the performances, not the plot.

080214473X|4.0|A riveting hour-by-hour account of the United States' disastrous military intervention in Somalia in 1993. Over a hundred well-armed, well-trained US soldiers set out on what was to be a cut-and-dry mission, only to find themselves pinned down on the streets of Mogadishu, facing the unexpected wrath of thousands of Somali fighters. Though the mission was a disaster, leading to the much publicized videos of American dead being dragged through the streets, the army rangers skillfully and bravely fought their way out. Bowden picks several individual stories and follows them closely, revealing in heart-pounding detail the chaos and desperation of modern urban warfare.    Bowden also visits the chain of events leading up to the battle, although he doesn't devote a lot of attention to the politics of how and why the US ended up in Mogadishu. I got the impression that neither the military nor the politicians expected things to turn badly so quickly, and that no one had a good read on the Somalis themselves.    Of the battle itself, Bowden writes knowledgeably and concisely, with clear admiration for the soldiers, but also paints the Somali participants (whose stories are featured to a lesser extent) with sympathy and humanity. Sadly, many innocent people were killed in the crossfire, and Somalia suffered far more than our country from the fallout of that day.    I read this book a year or two before the Iraq invasion, and have often thought that the architects of the war might have learned a little more from the lessons here. Surely, Iraq will generate many comparable books in a few years.

It was also Chris Mitchum's third film and it's also painfully obvious. Wayne's co-star is relatively unknown Jorge Rosas who was primarily active in the Mexican and European markets. This was his third English speaking film. Even the venerable Jack Elam seems to be off kilter. Elam (1918-2003) was a staple in western films, usually appearing as a villain. He made substantial contributions to films such as \\"Vera Cruz\\" (1954), \\"Gunfight at the OK Corral\\" (1957), and \\"Once Upon a Time in the  West\\" (1968).

0060512806|5.0|I read Snow Crash in the 90s and thought it was annoyingly overhyped. So, I didn't touch Stephenson for a long time, until a friend persuaded me to read this book.  Now I understand the acclaim. This book is f***ing brilliant. Stephenson takes the interesting subject matter of cryptography, mathematics, control of information, data heavens, and electronic currency, expands his scope to the fascinating personalities drawn to these fields and the enormous stakes around them, and from there launches into a globe-spanning, across-the-decades, conspiracy-filled adventure. Roughly half the book takes place during World War II, and the other half in the modern day (i.e. the late 1990s). Aside from the intellectual showdowns, there's plenty of action -- dangerous WWII missions behind enemy lines, a secret Japanese base, a search for lost treasure, and dangerous rivals from the past. Stephenson's awesomeness lies in making ideas and history seem connected in a vital, exciting way, by giving both a bit of a Raiders of the Lost Ark treatment.  But the real reason to read Stephenson is the fact he writes with such geeky, inspired lunancy, seeing nothing wrong with (for instance) writing a madcap scene in which a Doctor Strangelove-esque version of General Douglas MacArthur stares down strafing Japanese fighter planes while clad in a pink bathrobe, then following it up with a Powerpoint-like lecture (complete with graphs) on how a young math genius's productivity correlates with his horniness level, explaining some nuance of cryptography in the process. Stephenson clearly finds his subject material fascinating, and the book leaps from manga-like action scene, to discussions of made-up cultures, to digressions into technical subject matter, the author bent on sweeping the reader up in his exuberance.  This book (like his Quicksilver series) feels less like a history and more like a reimagining of history, told in a language that falls somewhere between science fiction, tongue-in-cheek adventure (e.g. The Princess Bride), and a Wired Magazine cover story. It seems that what Stephenson is really trying to do is foretell the future, but by reverse-extrapolating it into the past.  Crytonomicon certainly has a few flaws in its many pages; Stephenson's main weakness is that he tries to juggle a few too many balls at once, which causes some of the plot threads to underwhelm, but never mind -- few writers try to connect so many ideas in one work, and pull it off with such elan.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|I find this version of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol not for children, but for the older viewer (e.g. sixteen or older).  Why?  Because the \\"Disney\\" name is miss-leading.  Understand me correctly!  I find that Disney actually hit on the metaphysical/theological level giving a quite frank appearance to the wasting away of the spirit of Christmas present, for which a applaud them!  Bravo for not \\"sugar coating\\" what lies ahead for us all!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I am glad to have purchased it; however, I would not show it to the typical Disney age viewer!  4 stars...I hope all whom view this movie are changed for the better!
0307346617|4.0|Lots of zombie novels and movies have been written before, but Brooks is the first (that I know of) to hit upon taking a zombie plague outside the local shopping mall and turning it into a worldwide struggle, with stories and accounts from many different locales and participants. It's all unapologetically tongue-and-cheek, and some of the many short vignettes inevitably fall flat, but the best ones smartly speculate on the variety of ways a besieged humanity might respond to a zombie onslaught, or the implications such an event would have on different societies. It's a pretty quick read, but Brooks' creativity and clever use of issues from the headlines elevates World War Z above the B-movie shlock it pays tribute to, and you even find your pulse quickening as the guts and resourcefulness of humanity ultimately prevail over the mindless enemy.

B0034G4P7Q|4.0|\\"The Social Network\\" is based on Ben Mezrich's \\"The Accidental Billionaires,\\" a flawed but interesting look at the founding of Facebook.  Aaron Sorkin brings \\"The West Wing's\\" fast, witty dialogue to the movie, but the movie's main weakness is its subject matter.  It has too much Harvard in it, which means that it has way too many a-holes in it.    We hardly see Mark Zuckerberg in Ben Mezrich's book (which is basically Mark's former best friend Eduardo Saverin's revenge), and while we do see Mark in the beginning with a revealing and brilliantly scripted dialogue between Mark and his former girlfriend Erica Albright the movie isn't really a bio-pic.  It's really about the founding of Facebook, and it's hard for a movie to focus on the genesis and evolution of an idea.  And where the movie focuses on bio-pic elements (failed relationships driving both Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker to seek a name for themselves) it doesn't develop these elements.  And if it did it still cannot get around the fact that both Mark and Sean are only hovering around 20 -- and while they live in interesting times and did interesting things they themselves aren't that interesting.      Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire.  He works really hard, and he's focused on having Facebook dominate everything.  But he's also boring, and doesn't really deserve a movie.
B003JTHESA|2.0|When I first heard Brave New World the song Wicker Man really grabbed me and I thought well it seems like Maiden can still craft a good rockin' tune!  You won't get that type of revelatory moment here.  These songs all kinda drag and are quite ponderous.  I can only liken it to Priest's last effort Nostradamus.  It just dragged on and on.  The songs are all looooong but not particularly interesting.  Early Maiden albums usually had a long closing song at the end that was usually quite good like Rhyme Of The Ancient Mariner.  None of these songs approach that.  2 stars for the musicianship but the music is sorta blah.  Go listen to Killers again and remember how great Maiden once was.
0811875555|5.0|I have seen the movie and this book is absolutely amazing. Every little detail either in the movie or behind the scene is portrayed so gorgeously. That includes the landscape design, characters, storytelling, and the animation. This is one of the best Disney art book I've ever gotten. It's a must for not only animation artists, but everybody who loves the art of Disney. Disney is one of the few studios, which brings our beloved fairy tales into life, in such case, Tangled is among those successfully Disney classics.

B0021L8V0W|4.0|First when the movie just started and Russia got blended into *another stupid war with U.S*,I thought:''Common give me a break! A guy comes to CIA and tells that the country dies and the president will die, and all other upcoming nonsense. I was like...okay how much director payed to him to say all that? And why would Russian man would want to kill some Russian president? I thought I'd finish eating and go watch another movie.'' But I gave it a try and I'm glad I did. It had some twists and I liked the action parts especially on Angelina's behalf. The whole movie was pretty cool. Watch it for yourself. I recommend it.

Real women don't talk like this...actually, real people don't either.  The idea is neat, I would have loved to see it written with less 'happily ever after' and princess-girly chatter.

This DVD has excellent video and audio, no weakness in either.<br /><br />The program gives a full overview of the masters of Classic / Jazz & Rock fusion that is ELP.  While I would have loved to have full versions of Tarkus, Pictures at an Exhibition and Karnevil 9, the time allowed me to enjoy one of the best groups ever.<br /><br />Don't pass on this DVD at a great price.
B00005JMAH|5.0|For me, i love the harry potter series and this one happens to be my favorite. i liked all the extra bonus things on the dvd. perhaps, my favroite extra bouns feature is the personal interview with the cast. The interviews consits of: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Waston; another one is with the Syltherin kids, in the interview Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Crabbe, and Goyle. i liked them all. For me, i like the character Perfossor Severus Sanape and i was sort of disappointed that they didn't do an interview with Alan Rickman a.k.a Professor Severus Snape. All in all, i loved this movie and i would highly recommened it.
B00275EGWY|1.0|What an insulting, jingoistic farce this movie is. Even worse, it's boring with it. As far as I'm concerned, it is a self-absorbed, insular little film about what heroes the soldiers are fighting for freedom. There are no Iraqi actors playing any significant parts, it's just a typical piece of Hollywood racism-it's no better than old flicks that had Blacks or Asians in them as the fall guy. Whilst war is horrible and traumatic for the soldiers, it is as horrific for innocent civilians. I think only the indie or art house scene would dare to make a more interesting movie seen from another perspective. I don't care if this offends \\"patriots\\" because some of the best movies about the Middle East are made by the people from those countries. This movie is just a load of old macho angst nonsense, and gives the impression of a righteous cause. There is no character development, no empathy in the face of suffering, just an empty shell of a movie, I'm glad it has received only 3 stars averaged out, I suspect folk outside the US reviewing it have offered a more telling perspective on this movie to counter the very loud noise coming out of the US about this film.

B003YGSLDA|4.0|People love to dump all over this movie, but it's a visually stunning 80's classic. Maybe some people forget a good dose of cheese was required for most 80's films, and this one is no exception. Give it a try, it'sa fun view, and looks stunning on blu ray!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I finally reached my breaking point, I couldn't stop hearing about how awesome this show called \\"Dexter\\" was.  I knew going in it was about a serial killer, and that's about it.  What I didn't know was how addictingly amazing this show was going to be.  Buyer beware, if you haven't seen Dexter before, you better set aside a few hours if you plan on watching it.  I found it impossible to resist the draw of the series and very rarely did I ever just watch one episode at a time.  There were days where I would wake up and just watch 3 straight episodes in a row, then go to bed later that day and just be happy I was off from college at the time so I could just wake up and watch even more.    The writing in this show is fantastic and I don't want to say too much about the series as it's really best to let the masterful story craftsman do their fine work and let them reveal everything you want to know about the story.  All I can say is watch it.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed, I certainly wasn't.

B0002KVULG|5.0|This is by far in my opinion, the sexiest Dracula retelling on the market! Frank Langella just nails the role as the disturbingly hypnotic Count Dracula. He has fleshed out the character so well, that you actually root for him to escape with his new bride and let the villagers be damned.  There is maybe just one scene where I think things were a bit campy (Dracula smashing a mirror in front of Van Helsing) but beyond that, an elegant telling of the tale. An excellent DVD to add to your collection of monster movie.

I wonder if they do it also together, men and women working at the same place... but the metaphor is very strong, and he takes it very seriously.<br /><br />Speaking without walls, barriers, without hiding, being open and vulnerable, and also, clean of what is not necessary. Well prepared but flexible, being there in the moment.

But explains them better, and gives also new ideas!<br /><br />Alas, never going over the time, that is not, yet, me.

B00004TS0E|4.0|In New York City, a stranger named Kriss Kringle (Richard Attenborugh) who claims to be Saint Nick steps in as a new Santa Claus for the department store after the old Santa got drunk. He seems to be a celebrity around 34th street thanks to giving advice to other people if the store doesn't have it to go to other stores, skeptical mother Dorey Walker (Elizabeth Parker) and child Susan (Mara Wilson) both befriend him yet have a hard time to believe he actually is Santa Claus. Dorey's lawyer boyfriend Bryan (Dylan McDermott) begins to defend Kris in court after him being accused of beating up a former department store Santa.<br /><br />Unneeded but surprisingly good remake of the timeless 1947 masterpiece! John Hughes who co-wrote and produced this remake did a good yet dark job of bringing the fable once again. It's different but fresh from the original even though the court-room sequence in this one isn't as well made as the original's, this one co-stars William Windom, Robert Prosky and J.T. Walsh as i do believe it does respect the original in a good manner.<br /><br />This DVD has good picture and decent sound with trailers to other fox releases.
030745455X|5.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage) by Steig Larsson is a wonderful follow-up to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I found it mesmerizing and a wonderful psychological thriller. The Millenium Magazine, where reporter Mikael Blomkvist works as a journalist, has two other journalists doing an expose on the sex-trade in Sweden. When they are killed, Lisbeth's fingerprints are found on the gun and she is hunted country-wide. Mikael does his own investigation and doesn't believe that she is responsible for the murders. However, a huge manhunt ensues for Lisbeth.<br /><br />Lisbeth's past life comes more into the forefront in this book and the reader gets to know what 'all the evil' means. We learn about her past and her family. Meanwhile, Lisbeth has managed, with her computer savvy, to steal several million kroner that once belonged to the criminal Wennerstrom and is living in a beautiful apartment that no one knows about. It is her safety net. Anyone who has been friends with Lisbeth is not safe, and this includes her old friend Mimi.<br /><br />Lisbeth is still strangely introverted, independent, and keeps away from Blomkvist. She befriends her beloved past guardian, the one before the evil Bjurson, and they play chess in his nursing home weekly. She even pays for a personal trainer to help him recover from his stroke.<br /><br />Gradually the reader finds out that there has been a huge conspiracy against Lisbeth since 'the evil began' and the action ups in ante. There are multi-national gangs involved, all dealing with sex and drug trafficking. These are not people to mess with but Lisbeth takes them on. Occasionally I got confused with the names of all the gang members and sex traders but I just kept on reading and it fell into place.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the next one in the trilogy.

0590435272|5.0|What can one say about this beautiful timeless classic? I have lost count of how many times I've read it. And each time I read it, I fall in love with it all over again. I am not that familiar with Charles Dickens (something I need to work on!), but his prose is simply captivating. Each detail is described with simple clarity, from the horror of Marley returning from the grave to the humor of Scrooge's encounter with Bob Cratchit at the end of the story. Further, Dickens makes the characters as real people, and as the reader you can't help but get swept up in their lives and learn to love them, beginning with Scrooge's loving nephew Fred, and the innocent Tiny Tim, to the original \\"Grinch\\" himself, Mr. Scrooge. Emotions range from joy to fear to sadness and back again, and it all concludes with that heart-warming and unforgettable quote, \\"God bless us, everyone!\\"
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Starting out I would like to mention that I own two of these coolers. One is cooling an overclocked i5 750 and the other is on a overclocked Athlon 640.    The cooling is astounding for such a cheap CPU cooler. It keeps the i5 750 quad below 65c even with when it is running at 3.8GHz. On the Athlon, (which has the benefit of being a much less power hungry chip than the i5)has never been above 45c even when running LinX or Prime95.    Installation isn't a big deal, the first time it took a little head scratching but I figured it out in less than 5 minutes and had it together and ready to go in the next five. That was with the i5, with the Athlon it took less time.     The size isn't much of an issue for me. I have it in a Lian Li K58 and in an Antec 300 case. The Antec case worried me slightly because it is known as kind of a small case but it fit without an issue. It might interfere with tall ram though.    I think the only cooler that can compete with this one for around the same price is the Core Contact Freezer but this cooler is not compatible with the 1156 socket and uses push pins, and I do not like push pins at all.     I would say buy it, unless you can't look at something and figure it out in which case leave the computer building to someone else.

B00425S1H8|5.0|This is a very good Serial-USB adapter.  Not much than can be said about it except that it installs easily and works flawlessly.  Installing the drivers one time from the provided DVD enabled every USB port in my machine to recognize the adapter immediately.

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone having a need for a Serial-USB adapter.
006145205X|5.0|Ridley's basic idea is the trade, exchange and specialization are the key element not only in human progress, but in making humanity the dominant species on Earth. He claims the Neanderthals had slightly bigger brains than humans, and probably had the physical equipment for Language but never traded outside a very limited local area. Trading and exchange , enable specialization and the development of a collective brain which impels human progress. In other words Ridley in effect suggests that all the different theses which have been forwarded to explain human distinctiveness are secondary to this collective process. It is not that humans have bigger brains, or that they moved from the trees to the savvanah, or that they cooked together and so became cooperative in a new way, or that they stood up and looked over the savvanah at their prey and developed bigger brains.... All of these kinds of ideas are subordinate to the Trade and Exchange motif. Ridley provides a wide range of data from various eras and areas of the world to support his thesis. But like all explanations which seem to tell the whole of a complicated story it seems to me just that, too simplistic.<br />Ridley's rational optimism also seems to me questionable in other ways. Anyone who looks at the situation of humanity today from an economic standpoint alone perhaps may in the long - range be optimistic. But there are so many other elements at play which color the human situation. The world's countries are by and large backward politically . The coming Superpower is a Totalitarian police- state. Ridley writes about the Ming dynasty and its disastrous cutting of Trade. A Chinese dominated Mankind might not be a paradise of innovation and unending progress.<br />My own feeling then is that while Ridley makes strong cases against many different kinds of Doomsday Scenarios, he does not give enough place to the uncertainty of life and history. What about the single Asteroid that destroys civilizations? or about the human manufacture of vicious anti- human destructive technologies?<br />It may be commendable to be a rational optimist and many trends point to a more prosperous human future. But again is 'prosperity' the only real human value?<br />Another point from a different perspective entirely. One problem with being such an assured rational optimist is that one seems to lack a certain humility which many students of human history have.<br />There are processes after all which go on for thousands of years and then come to an end.<br />Against this it might be said in defense of Ridley that his focus is really on the coming one- hundred years. This is a more reasonable time to be reasonably optimistic rather than the 'forever' he speaks about. To speak about the 'forever' he would have to enter a realm of discourse I do not think he particularly enjoys i.e. Religious discourse.he human manufacture of vicious anti- human destructive technologies?

B002E01LL6|2.0|This movie sucked badly. Channing's character came off as being kind of slow. His speech was really slow as if even before he even started fighting, he took one to many blows to the head.  And he couldn't even fight.  He only won his first fight by knocking a guys head into some kind of fountain. He couldn't even beat that big guy. Oh and don't get me started on the fight against the chinese guy; three time world champion Cung Le.  Even without me knowing who Cung Le was I could see that Channing's character was no match for him.  The only good scenes in this movie was when he fought Evan in the end and when they won all that money.  Now that was a real fight.<br />So glad I waited until this came on cable, because had I'd went to see this at the movies I would have been pissed off.  This movie is not even worthy of Channing or Terrance Howard.  I can't believe someone actually made this movie as a supposed action movie and then named it \\"Fighting\\", it should have been called \\"Dreaming\\".  Because the character in this movie must have been dreaming if he thought he was a good fighter.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I think this really puts Ben Affleck to the A's list acting status (in terms of really good acting). Since the Good Will Hunting movie, he is back to the real deal now.   Great acting.

B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I saw this film in the movies last summer.  However I enjoyed the blu-ray of the unrated director's cut even more.  In an age of pretty boys like Pitt, Damon, DiCaprio, etc., Russell Crowe seems to be a throwback to the age of real men like Wayne and Gable.  He is terrific.  He is matched by Cate Blanchett.  Terrific casting: She is attractive in a non-glamourous type of way.  She strikes me as looking as a midevil woman might look.  (Somehow I cannot see a Jennifer Anniston type in this role.)  They are matched with terrific supporting performance by William Hurt, Max Von Sydow, among others.  The sets and the action scenes are terrific.  There is a rousing battle scene at the end as King Philip of France launches a seaborne invasion of Britain, only to be repulsed by the Brits led by Robin Hood.  This scene reminds one of a mid-evil version of the D-Day landings in Darryl F. Zanuck's classic \\"The Longest Day.\\"  Directed by Ridley Scott, this reminds one of their earlier triumph \\"Gladiator.\\"  Crowe even mentions on the very good documentary on the making of this film that they were trying to emulate, even one-up, the previous film.<br />Other than the documentary, there are many very good deleted scenes with or without commentary by the film's editor.<br />In conclusion, this is an epic intelligent historical spectacular.  As stated, I enjoyed it even more this time.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray are excellent as well.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|There are already some terrific reviews posted on this title - I found the top review particularly informative regarding the different iterations this film has has on DVD and praising the quality of this transfer, so I have little really to add - but I didn't let that stop me! To be honest, I felt compelled to post a review after watching this film tonight, Christmas night, with my family. This was the first time my 5 year old son and 8 year old daughter have seen this masterpiece - and they LOVED it! I have always loved this movie as well and  in the past had enjoyed it mostly during TV presentations and once on an old laserdisc. I had not purchased the prior DVD versions as this is a film I had been waiting to get in high definition - an admittedly dramatic step up from laserdisc!<br /><br />From the moment we hit play the whole family was blown away with the picture and sound quality. I was also surprised to see a few extra scenes which I did not recall - some additional footage with the kids playing around Salzburg and some other shorter pieces throughout - likely these are usually cut by the networks for TV showings so that was an unexpected treat. I feel this truly is the definitive edition of this wonderful film and I couldn't be happier that I had the chance to share it with my kids (and wife and in-laws) in such pristine quality on this sacred night. Somehow the higher quality level seems to increase the emotional connection one makes with a movie and I must admit as a 43 old dad several scenes brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend purchasing this set which also includes a DVD version. I have not had time to check out the extras yet but they look terrific as well. If you have a blu-ray player and love musical theatre, you really must own this film. My advice is to just buy it!
0307272702|4.0|Gary Taubes is an award-winning science investigator and journalist educated at Harvard, Stanford and Columbia.  He is not a diet doctor and has no axe to grind in the weight-loss debate.  As an objective researcher with an impressive track record, his only motivation is to wade through the many studies and theories regarding obesity and arrive at a practical, accurate answer to the question of WHY WE GET FAT AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.   Taubes' indictment of the medical community and its current handling of the  matter is scathing.  But it's not based on finger-pointing and ridicule.  Taubes is not a fanatic nutjob or loose cannon.  He is horrified by the sharp increase in obesity, diabetes and related diseases in our Western culture, especially in children, as well as by the way ill-informed doctors throw the responsibility and blame back on overweight people.  Talk to any so-called expert in the field of weight loss, any doctor on your HMO, any trainer at the local gym, and any person you meet on the street, and they'll all agree that the only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take in, especially fat calories.  The raison d'être of WHY WE GET FAT is to debunk this persistent and ubiquitous myth once and for all.  Like Columbus insisting to a confident clergy that the world is indeed round, Taubes has set his course for the frontier of reason, common sense and science, backed by a study of history and a huge body of research.    Before I read this book, I too believed that \\"calories in-calories out\\" was at the heart of the problem of overweight.  I also believed that eating fats, especially saturated fats, would kill me.  But at the same time, I came to this book having had an interesting and dramatic experience:  About two years ago, in order to address the problem of acid reflux, I switched to the Paleo Diet.  I eliminated all carbohydrates -- no grains, beans or dairy; I eat only animal protein, nuts and seeds, vegetables and fruits that are naturally low in sugar.  I admit I wasn't exercising at all.  Nevertheless, I lost 15 pounds over the period of a year. My acid reflux was cured, my gums and teeth improved, my joint pain went away, and gas and bloating are a thing of the past.  And despite the fact that I eat meat several times a day, my HDL went up, my LDL stayed stable, and my total cholesterol went down.  Why did this happen?  Taubes explains why.    In short:  we don't get fat because we eat too much and don't burn it off.  We get fat because we eat carbohydrates.  And even more interesting, we overeat because we're getting fat.  Huh?  Read the book.  Taubes devotes the entire book to explaining the issue in great detail.  WHY WE GET FAT is not a pamphlet -- it is a comprehensive study in which Taubes addresses every logical argument we might throw at him, and backs it up with statistics and science.  He explains how fat regulation works.  How does the body handle fats, carbohydrates, proteins?  What is the role of hormones?  What is the role of insulin in the big picture?  Why do we get hungry and what happens to the body when we do?  Why do obesity and diabetes often go hand-in-hand, as seen by the dramatic increase in both conditions among young adults?  He even gets into the nits of the topic, such as the difference between small, dense LDL, which causes atherosclerosis, and large, fluffy LDL, which does not.  I didn't know there were two kinds, did you?    Taubes returns often to the medical community's dogged resistance to the facts in this matter.  When the results of the studies don't fit the accepted paradigm, the results are ignored.  A poignant exception to this rule is discussed in Chapter 18 - The Nature of a Healthy Diet.  Taubes describes a Stanford University study, funded by the government at a cost of $2 million, the results of which were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2007.  The designer of the study, Christopher Gardner, director of NutritionStudies at Stanford, presents the results in a YouTube video called \\"The Battle of Weight Loss Diets: Is Anybody Winning (at Losing)?\\"  The study compared four diets:  Atkins; traditional weight loss diet; Ornish; and Zone.  It looked at weight loss, blood pressure and cholesterol.  Dr. Gardner, a vegetarian for 25 years, ran the study because he wanted to prove that a diet like the Atkins diet, which is rich in meat and saturated fats and low in carbohydrates, could be dangerous.  However, the Atkins diet came out on top, which Dr. Gardner describes as \\"a  bitter pill to swallow.\\"  At least he didn't bury the results.  (By the way, Taubes is not an advocate of the Atkins diet per se, but the superiority of the low-carbohydrate Atkins diet in this study is obvious.)    I have a few criticisms of the book, particularly when Taubes suggests a diet plan.  His choices are fairly limited and he doesn't include nuts.  I wouldn't use the book as a guideline of what specifically to eat.  (For that, I'd recommend the many good books on the Paleo diet by Loren Cordain, Robb Wolf and others.)  But for an understanding of the science of weight loss and fat regulation, Taubes is the go-to guy.    If my review is making you mad, you're thinking \\"yes, but...\\" and \\"what about...\\", and you want to start typing a big retort, I'd like to invite you to first read WHY WE GET FAT AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, and chew on it for awhile.  Like Taubes, I have no axe to grind.  But I have seen many overweight people suffer needlessly in terms of health and self-esteem from being told they're too gluttonous and lazy to take care of themselves.  It's time to put an end to this needless suffering.  Knowledge is power.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|Background:<br /><br />The title of this film was based on the predictions of the Mayan Calendar. This calendar predicts that that cataclysmic or transformative events will occur in the year 2012 culminating on the winter solstice December 21, 2012. It is important to note that this conclusion is based on subjective interpretations. These interpretations are broadly based on a mixture of archaeoastronomical speculation, mythology, and numerological constructions. Additionally, it is believed that the Mayans may have had the help of extraterrestrial beings.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Holy Bible in the Book of Revelation does outline the end of this age as well in what is known as the apocalypse. The primary difference in these schools of thought is that, the Mayans believed that the earth goes through a recycling process approximately every 5,125 solar years, while the Bible teaches that the apocalypse is really a period of judgment and purification, after which the earth will then go into what is known as the Millenniun Reign of Christ.<br /><br />Based on the writings of the Bible, you can be pretty sure that the world will NOT end in the year 2012.<br /><br />Plot/Storyline:<br /><br />The story starts in India, in the year 2009, Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an American geologist, visits astrophysicist Dr. Satnam Tsurutani (Jimi Mistry). What is discovered is that neutrinos from a massive solar flare are causing the temperature of the Earth's core to increase. This in turn will lead to the the earth becoming unstable.<br /><br />As a result, in 2010 a secret project intended to ensure humanity's survival is initiated. This project involves the construction of massive ships at Cho Ming, Tibet, in the Himalayas. These ships will have the capacity to hold about 400,000 people (mostly politicians and the very wealthy)<br /><br />Now in the year 2012, we meet Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a science fiction writer in Los Angeles who works part-time as a limousine driver for billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buriæ). Using the limo, he takes his two children on a camping trip at Yellowstone National Park, it is here that he discovers that all is not well and that major catastrophes are no the way.<br /><br />Cinematics:<br /><br />This film is a cinematic wonder. Presented are a series of massive cataclysmic events that include entire cities. If you hook up a sub-woofer to your DVD player you will be able to capture all the spectacular rumbling noise that goes with these earthquakes.<br /><br />What raises the tension in this film is the many instances where Curtis barely escapes with his family. On several occasions he is just feet away from the collapsing surface of the earth. Some of these scenes will have you holding onto your seat. The excitement in this film is EXTREME!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is a film that shows how fragile life as we know it really is, and how there is really a very delicate balance in place that keeps our daily lives going. While I do not believe that anything major will happen in 2012, there is still something up ahead in the not too distant future.uriæ).

B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is arguably one of the funniest series ever created.  Be sure to watch the \\"backstory\\" included with this connection.  This series is a perfect example of how somebody really funny can make the most wonderful lemonade when life gives him lemons.  If anything it's even funnier than 80% of the \\"Flying Circus\\" sketches.  I particularly recommend the episode entitled \\"Basil the Rat\\".
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I just received the mini-series for Christmas on DVD, and had already borrowed it before to watch it.  Paul Giamatti is phenomenal as John Adams and Laura Linney is beyond belief as Abigail Adams.  The entire series is well written and acted.  If all television were this good I would watch a great deal more of it.
B002ZG981E|1.0|Sorry to say this is the most confusing film I've ever watched!  Made absolutely no sense, at all.  Thank God I didn't buy the DVD as it would have been a waste of money.  As it is, all I managed to waste was a few minutes of my life.  Leo get 99 demerits for not refusing to star (?) in this movie.  Good Grief!  What one won't do for the almighty buck!

B003NWS5AO|1.0|This is the last time that I buy, without first listening, a new album of one of my heroes from that grand and golden age when rock music took the world by a storm (the 60s & 70s). This is the most boring and depressing music I have ever heard from any member of the Led Zeppelin family. It makes me feel older than I am, and I just wonder why someone can't tell artists when to stop. I put this in the same bin as Dylan's 'Christmas in the Heart', Leonard Cohen's recent Live in London album & The Rolling Stones' embarrassing 'Shine a Light'. Also notice how,when inspiraion runs out, many turn to rootsie countryfied stuff ('Raising Sand') and go all 'world music' on us (the American Indian vibe running through the hapless 'Band of Joy'). [Quite frankly, there is only one artist that gets better as he ages - Willie Nelson (believe it or not!).] I despise this album so much that I am angry at having paid $1.20 for it on a sale! It now takes up space in my shelves, and is there only for completion's sake - because I assure you, Robert Plant is up there (with Jimi, Bob & Stones) as one of my biggest musical heroes of all time.
0452295548|5.0|The book of Author Jull Bolte Taylor, PhD., MY STROKE OF INSIGHT, is osetnsibly a fascinating and thought-provoking retelling of her transformative experince during and following a dangerous stroke. A Harvard-trained brain scientist, Taylor was shocked to find that this life-threatening and disabling event was to be the most significant and dramatic learning experience of her life. Her sharing of it provides insight into both the danger and potentiality of the stroke experience. But her most important finding was the discovery that she not only could recover from this attack, but had learned that she could and would have the ways and means to modify her personality to become a person she desired to be. As she testifies, \\"...through our understanding that we have two very distinct ways of being in the world, we can deliberately choose to have miuch more power over what's going on inside our brains than we ever imagined!\\"  For a much better and more helpful understanding of what is going on inside of your own brain, what you can do about it, and how you can be the person you choose to be, I highly recommend this book. It is one of a kind. (A Plume Book,the Penguin Group, June 2009, 206 pp., paperback.$15).
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Was very skeptical when I first heard about this TV series - mostly because no one can replace Jack Lord as Steve McGarrett or any of the other cast members from the original episodes.  I couldn't imagine how they could replace Dano either or have a female cast member.  But, after watching several episodes, I would rate this the best TV watching out there, 5 stars.  The plots are great, interesting and intense and the acting is wonderful - I enjoy the relationship and humor between Dano and Steve McGarrett.  I don't try to compare the old with the new - just enjoy watching it as a new TV series that is just good crime drama.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is by far the most interesting book I've read in a long time.  I am grateful to Henrietta Lacks, her family, and any other women like her whose very body was used to advance cancer research.  It is amazing what researchers discovered from Henrietta Lacks' body.  The ethical questions are very thought provoking.  To learn of her battle and that of her family, is amazing and eye-opening to someone raised in a different world.  This would be an amazing learning experience for high school students.  The book rolls science, history, real life and excellent writing all in one.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I found this book very compelling and the story well written.  My only complaint was that there were too many characters, which at times made it hard to follow.  Overall, a very good book though.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Winter's Bone is set in rural Missouri, and, having lived most of my life in the suburbs of New York City, I have no idea if the characters portrayed are authentic or not. It doesn't matter. The themes of the movie, social dissolution and the shattering possibility of becoming homeless, are universal.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Ree Dolly, is such a good actress that she makes the rest of the (very good) cast look almost phony by comparison. But her performance would have much less impact it weren't for the fine attention paid to seemingly unimportant little details.<br /><br />There's one scene that seems unimportant in terms of moving the plot,but stands out nevertheless. At the moment, It seems inevitable that Ree, her mentally disturbed mother, her little brother and sister are going to be put out in the street, or, in their case, put out into the woods. Ree is looking through her closet. That's all she's doing, looking through a closet. And yet you find yourself thinking \\"now that they're going to be homeless, where are they going to put all the shoes?\\" It hammers home just how important a sense of place is to an individual's identity. That shack and that little plot of land may not be much, but to the Dolly family, it means survival.<br /><br />There's another scene where the local sherif tries to assure Ree that he didn't back down in front of her uncle and she gets this little smirk in the corner of her mouth that makes it clear how completely she sees through his macho act. It reveals how so many seemingly passive women in patriarchal societies view their men, with contempt.<br /><br />The film has a \\"happy\\" ending as far as it goes, but the movie leaves you with a question. Will Ree Dolly be able to resist being pulled down into her community's dis-functional world of drugs and violence or will she be able to establish some order and rationality for herself and her little brother and sister? In the end, the struggle to establish one's individuality in the face of a hostile world, is the dilemma we all face, even though almost certainly in less desperate circumstances.e world, is the dilemma we all face, even though almost certainly in less desperate circumstances.

I used to never see the point, until i have slowed down a little and became a stay at home mommy, & not as stressed any more and are actually starting to find things i enjoy besides being obsessed with working all the time.  Like i said Not a fiction book reader but i used to Just usually read self helping, motivational, etiquette & books with info. But i can follow this book nicely and in one night before bedtime i found myself on chapter 3! I was proud! Because im a person that gets very distracted easily.  Theres nothing like murder mystery before bedtime read! :) Im enjoying cozying up with this book.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|Have to wonder if I didn't get a defective or mislabeled DVD! The packaging says there's 3 versions, but nowhere in any of the DVD menus are you able to find the other 2 versions referenced on the box!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Just wanted to let fellow Amazon denizens know that the secret to the 2 extra versions of Salt on the non-Bluray version of the Deluxe Unrated Edition DVD can be found on the Main Menu by clicking the empty space to the left of \\"Play Movie.\\" It takes you to the Director's Cut and the Extended Version.     I was pretty frustrated for a while there clicking all over the screen at imagionary targets.      I really enjoyed the movie in the theaters but when I read the script long before it was in theaters I thought the best part of the story was the backstory and that was almost completely gone from the movie. Thanks to a heads up by one of the reviewers here I am hoping to find those scenes in the extended version.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|A wonderful change for Kid, I'm a fan of all his music but this really shows he can change his style and still be a hit! He is such a multi talented guy and it is nice to hear another side. Been playing it since I got it 2 weeks ago and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005NNMK|1.0|I went to the bathroom. When I was finished doing my business, I lifted up the toilet seat to check to see what came out. There in the bowl, swirling about, was the group Europe singing \\"The Final Countdown\\". What crap this group was!
031603438X|4.0|Just when I thought I could not stomach another junkie in recovery story, this work came along and proved to me that there was more to this fellow than meets the eye. To tell the truth, I knew little of Richards before this book, and now am pleased to have made his literary acquaintance. Mad props to James Fox for the writing which is worthy of the best autobiographies, not something just slapped together to make a buck.      There are parts that I would want more of and parts that I would want less of.  More of the stories of post-war Britain. I, ignorant, had no idea that candy was hard to come by until well into the 50s.   And it would appear that Richards is very delicate about not hurting others' feelings, particularly those of Mick and his ex, Anita.  A little more, without scurrility, would have enticed.    Great read!
B0000630YA|3.0|No self-respecting, educated Alice Cooper fan can be happy with this work since this was the start of \\"Alice Cooper\\" the personality and the end of \\"Alice Cooper\\" the band.<br /><br />\\"Alice Cooper\\" was a band, a kick ass band emanating out of Detroit. Their music and hijinks were supposed to be a reaction to the already stale and unrealistic flower power that these guys did not share and agree with. This band was talented yet gritty, adventerous yet still rooted in basic rock and roll.  \\"Love it to Death\\", \\"Killer\\", \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" \\"Schools Out\\" and even some of \\"Muscle of Love\\" are albums so superior to \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" that you cannot compare them. The Alice Cooper band blows away Alice Cooper as a solo artist.<br /><br />Now, there are some good songs on this album. It's just that these tunes are very different, very watered down from his previous efforts. The stage shows and performance art was essential to Alice Cooper but this is where the image became more important than the actual music.<br /><br />\\"Only Women Bleed\\", \\"Some Folks\\", \\"Escape\\" and the title tune \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" are the highlights. These are good songs, real good songs and belong with the best of this artist's material. However, the music lost it's edge and became too overproduced. This is when Alice \\"jumped the shark\\" and he never achieved the same commercial and critical success again.<br /><br />Now, you can't blame a person for trying to further their career and doing what's in their best interests. Alice may have moved away from his band because the band members had their own issues (I think drugs negatively took it's toll on this band).  I just cannot compare \\"Under my Wheels\\" or \\"Me My Lover\\" to anything on this album. Not even close!
B0018BB21G|5.0|Great CD with bonus tracks from Rarewaves in England.  Anyone having trouble finding the older Moody Blues albums should try these.  Good prices and arrive in great condition.
0553805371|4.0|I enjoyed reading The Grand Design for several reasons.  First, it refreshed my memory on a lot of old physics concepts that I'd forgotten since my college days.  For example, Hawking reviews the basics of quantum mechanics, including the elementary particles (e.g., quarks, bosons, etc.) that have been discovered thus far.  He also covers the basics of string theory.  Second, it rekindled my sense of wonder about the fundamental questions of the universe, and I think it would do this for most people with a healthy sense of scientific curiosity.  For example, it delves into the fundamental question of how a universe could be created in the first place.  Third, the book updated me on the cutting-edge theories of physics.  In particular, Hawking presents M-theory as a possible unification theory, and explains how it might be a good candidate for a comprehensive theory of the universe.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters of the book was the one in which he describes \\"The Game of Life\\", which is a very interesting simulation created a while back.  The Game of Life demonstrates how narrow our science may be in trying to discover the fundamental laws of the universe.  In fact, it almost depressed me to think that we are so limited by our human perception in trying to discover these fundamental laws.<br /><br />Some negatives about the book include that it took too long to really get into the interesting questions.  The first third or half of the book is mainly a history of science lesson.  Since I already knew most of this stuff, I didn't get anything new out of it.  But I suppose it might be a good introduction for someone who doesn't know or has forgotten the progression of science through the centuries.  Also, this book does offer an idea of how the universe may have been created out of nothing, but I didn't feel like the idea was very well explained.  The final lead-up to the hypothesis of the creation of something out of nothing is hasty, and not well connected toprevious explanations.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|Another outstanding CD with bonus tracks and the history behind its production.  These were never included in the US versions.  This was from Rarewaves in England.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Great price on Amazon! There are so many behind the scenes and special features that I wasn't aware of. Very pleased.
B0041X90ZS|5.0|First off, the band is in FINE form in this.  I have never seen a concert video of Neal Morse where he didn't have problems with throat-burn-out, hitting higher notes, etc, etc.  Assuming there's not a lot of \\"studio fixing\\" or auto-tune that occurred post-production with the audio on this (which there very well may be), almost everyone in the band especially nailed the lead and backing vocals much better than the \\"Live in Europe\\" DVD.  And as a whole, they seemed to be having a MUCH better time playing on this tour than the \\"Live in Europe\\" gig.  My biggest complaint with Transatlantic is their music seems TOO calculated at times...not enough spontaneous, \\"just cut loose\\" feel to it. Well, playing this live, they inject a lot of energy I don't think is present on the studio recording, and I can honestly say I enjoyed hearing this live more than the studio CD.    Video and editing was fine by me and didn't detract from the performance at all (an important aspect, I think).  Haven't listened to it in 5.1 yet, but as I've said in other reviews, unless you're Pink Floyd or doing some REALLY involved space rock, 5.1 mixes with live rock performances aren't so critical.  Nice, but not essential for enjoying the performance or music.    I'm not a big Neal Morse fan other than for the music he writes (his vox and lyrics don't do much for me), but he does love what he does, and that's nice to see.  In fact, that's the best point of this whole DVD performance.  They're performing cool music well, and seeming to have the time of their lives doing so (which is what I've critiqued the Flower Kings for NOT doing...getting excited about their music while playing).  What else can you ask for?  A bunch of prog nerd musicians with a bunch of prog nerd fans (don't get offended, I'm one too) diggin' the music and mood to the extreme.    And to top off this awesome video?  Audio CDs of the gig.  Sweet!    And finally, I admit this DVD pisses me off as well.  Why?  Because the Frankfurtconcert I saw only about 6 weeks before this concert was stuffed into an overbooked, over-max-capacity, fire-hazard of a club with the main exit route being DOWN a tight, steep flight of stairs, and despite dozens of people complaining to the club management and leaving, the venue owners just shrugged their shoulders.  And speaking of shoulders, I'm a decently tall guy, and in the middle of the crowd, most of all I could see of the band was from the shoulders up.  I occasionally saw Roine's guitar, and that and part of Portnoy's drum set was the only visual proof they were actually playing instruments.  Horrible experience visually (uh, which is why you GO to a concert...to have a visual experience tied with the audio), and it was quite easy to envision a German \\"love-parade\\" trampling or Ohio Who concert type of tragedy if any emergencies had developed in the club. Again...totally nuts.    So I'm VERY grateful they put out this very nice concert DVD to partially redeem the crap experience I had, but frustrated when I realize how good my 70 euro concert experience in Frankfurt SHOULD have been.    But, `nuff bellyachin' from me...in toto, this is very good documentation of a great concert, and if you're a prog nut, you will 99% likely enjoy it as such (\\"very good\\" and \\"great\\").    Cheers...
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I am glad they made this movie, I have the rest of the movies and have been waiting for them to make another movie, so when this movie comes out i will get it. I will not watch it in 3D because I have been told by a eye doctor 3D is not good for your eyes, other than that cant wait to see it on dvd because i did not see it in the movies
B0015DROBO|1.0|After looking at the glowing reviews, i have to think, did i read the same book?This is the worst book I have ever read. There is no decent, moral character in this book.  There is no point to the book. Nothing uplifts. The writing is old fashioned, cliched, tedious and clunky. Rape and torture is described in loving detail. I wish I could erase this book from my mind.
B004EJ14V2|5.0|Hey, this movie was great. In the spirit of mean girls and a throw back to the romantic comedies of the 1980's, this was a smart, sweet movie. If you are looking for a light comedy, that is not full of tired jokes about body parts and sex gags you have seen so many times you can see them coming, then check this movie out. We liked it so much, we are thinking about buying the movie!
0547338023|3.0|I was disappointed in this. Something gets lost in this version. I bought it for my granddaughter but told her that I was going to get her a copy of the other translation. I have always loved this story and when you read it at different points in your life, it takes on other meanings. I don't think you get the depth of the meaning of the story in this version. It's such a simple tale and so beautifully told in the older copy. Sometimes, you can't improve on perfection and it's better to leave things alone.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|I thought this book was hysterical. It was entertaining simply because the author never veers from his serious tone.  I gave it a 4 because it is only really good for one read through and there are some inconsistencies (as mentioned in a previous review) with the zombies abilities.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Got this for Christmas, one of my favorite series and the special features are so awesome!  Well worth the wait.
B001GCUER0|4.0|It took awhile for me to get hooked on this series -- watching only on DVD -- but after the first season I was a goner. I love that there are many levels to this show: sociological, historical, hysterical, theatrical, ethical, even comical. I'm deep into Season 3 and lusting for Season 4 so I can hardly recall specifically what I liked about Season 2. I just know that once you start watching \\"Mad Men,\\" you can't stop! PS Special features about the 1960s (I was there!) are a real plus.
B0001VV1GK|2.0|I really wanted to love this toy.  Overall, it is very sturdy and super cute.  We had the old version, where the elevator hangs off to the side, which is still being sold in some places.  The old version has a bigger elevator - hence the \\"It does/does not fit matchbox cars\\" confusion.  The old version was supposed to have been discontinued in 2008ish but it is still being sold in some places - we just got it, for Christmas 2010.    Our elevator broke within ONE DAY.      Plan agreed to send me a new part - to their credit they are great about sending parts.  In the mean time I set about fixing the old one.  It's not easy getting that black knob off on top, but I managed.  Basically there is a tiny piece of plastic under that black knob on top that serves as a clicker - the gear around the spool under the knob clicks against this to make the elevator ratchet up and down rather than slip when you reposition your hand.  Without that clicker, the toy is very frustrating for little hands to work.      This is not a matter of a child being hard on a toy - it's a matter of poor design.  So if you're hoping like I was that your kids will be easier on the toy - it won't help.  I don't think my kids were rough with this.      I tried to replace the clicker that broke off with a bit of a starbucks gift card but it broke shortly, too.  (I had to drill into the dowel holding it, and hold it in place with hot glue)  I tried to find another sort of plastic that would be strong enough to hold up the elevator but not break under repeated stress.  I tested the \\"cookie cards\\" from our grocery store, which also break under repeated stress - as well as milk jug plastic, which seemed less prone to breakage didn't hold up the elevator consistantly (too thin).      In the mean time the new part came and I thought I would put it on and see how it holds up while I work on a fix for the old part - well the replacement part was put together backwards (roof was on wrong) so it could not be installed at all.  And I was down to one day left to return this toy to where I bought it.      I ended up returning this toy.  I wanted to love it so bad, but the elevator is the best part of the toy, and if that is going to break all the time, no thanks.  If I kept experimenting - I probably could have fixed it.  I am wondering if Ziplock container plastic might work, or a different design altogether with two soft parts working against each other and relying on friction.      I am amazed at how many people report the elevator broke, but they still love it.  I sense a little \\"I paid a lot, I will love it anyway\\" or else wooden toy loyalty mentality here.  I bought a wooden toy hoping for long term durability but this was not the case. Overall it's very sturdy, it's just the elevator mechanism that is suspect - although a lot of people report their kids play with it just fine even when it doesn't click.  My kids liked the click.  HUGE disappointment.  If I can find a used one for cheap, I might give perfecting the elevator another go, but for the price I paid for this, it shouldn't require major alterations right off the bat.  Big let down!    I would really love to know over the long haul how many people still have a clicking elevator.  Is there any reason to believe the new design is any more durable?  With the new design, I am wary of them going for that string and grabbing it to see what happens - plus I just don't like how the elevator is smaller.  Even the most hard core of wood loving parents will probably acquire some matchbox cars at some point - it's nice to have a toy that doesn't require such specialized add ons.    edit - yes there IS a much older (2002?) version of this toy where the elevator rides up and down on a dowel.  I have found one.  Why on earth would they have discontinued this method in place of the gear and ratchet which seems to cause so much trouble?  I am sure the new way is cheaper but these toys are still pricey and you should get better quality for that price.  It's gotta be cheaper to make it with the dowel in the first place than to send out new elevators and in some cases whole new garages when the elevators break.    edit again - I've developed an unhealthy obsession with this toy.  I got another clicky elevator one where the car hangs off the side of the shaft, determined to fix it if it broke again, which it did, in 2 days.  I replaced the plastic clicker with a piece of spring-steel corset stay from a shaper I bought for my wedding and which I will probably never see the inside of again.  So far, it is holding up well - so if you have a garage to fix, consider giving that a try.  You can buy corset stays at most fabric stores.

I would still read one of his average books than most other authors. Has the same characters in it as the The Brass Verdict, but that was much better.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|If Hayao Miyazaki made a cyberthriller, the result might be something like \\"Summer Wars.\\" This colorful little anime movie spends most of its run straddling the line between a family reunion comedy and a world war entirely on the web. And the results manage to stir your heart and make you laugh at the same time.<br /><br />Math nerd Kenji is shocked when popular upperclassman Natsuki asks him to come to her family's country house for the weekend. Unfortunately, he's there under false pretenses -- not only is Natsuki claiming that he's her boyfriend, but that he's a wealthy college student at Tokyo U. Yeah, that is inevitably going to backfire.<br /><br />But something far worse happens when OZ (a crazy hybrid of amazon.com, Facebook, fighting video games and... well, just about everything you can find on the WWW) is hacked -- and Kenji is the main suspect.<br /><br />The truth is actually much more sinister -- a horrendous program called Love Machine is devouring OZ user avatars, and is using the computer connections to cause chaos all across the world. When tragedy strikes the family, Kenji inspires them to fight back against Love Machine. But can the family's plan stop the program before it has a chance to take revenge on them?<br /><br />\\"Summer Wars\\" isn't really like any other movie I've ever seen -- it's part cyberthriller, part bittersweet family story, part crazy comedy, and part colorful anime. It starts off as a simple family dramedy, with Kenji getting thrown into Natsuki's eccentric family and dealing with all the baggage they bring with them. Plus, you know he's going to get busted.<br /><br />But when Love Machine appears, the stakes are suddenly the technological safety of the ENTIRE WORLD. So we get a wild, crazy guerilla cyberwarefare (involving a boat, a giant computer, an army truck and lots of ice!) as the family (plus Kenji) unites to battle Love Machine. At the same time, the writer maintains the focus on the eccentric family, their grudges, and their unique personalities.<br /><br />Plus, the animation for this movie is SPELLBINDING. The \\"real world\\" stuff is rendered in traditional hand-drawn anime, but the scenes set in OZ are brilliant, surreal, colorful and dreamlike. Whole civilizations on shelves, crowned whales, floating islands, stacked sports stadia, and endless chambers filled with strange little creatures.<br /><br />And all the characters are very well-fleshed-out. Kenji is a nice, rather socially inept guy with epic math skills, and Natsuki is a strong young girl who finds herself with the weight of the ENTIRE PLANET on her shoulders. The entire cast is well-developed -- from the stately grandmother to the idiot cousin who doesn't know what's going on -- but one of the best is Kazuma, a 13-year-old kung-fu expert/computer nerd.<br /><br />\\"Summer Wars\\" may start small, but it quickly grows to the epic size of the World Wide Web itself. Even better: it's funny, heartwarming and all-around engrossing.lus, the animation for this movie is SPELLBINDING.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|My husband received \\"The Pacific\\" from me for his birthday. He had wanted it for awhile. He is watching each DVD and enjoying the historical value.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Stammering is a pretty common speech defect, and for most people it doesn't have earthshattering consequences. But for one man, it might have. \\"The King's Speech\\" chronicles the true-life story of King George VI's struggle to gain the confidence to lead his nation -- a powerful, tensely-written movie, with some truly brilliant performances.<br /><br />For many years, Prince Albert (Colin Firth) dreaded any kind of public speaking because of his crippling stammer. So his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham-Carter) drags him to a speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who gives him vocal and physical exercises. Logue also learns more about \\"Bertie's\\" psyche -- his sensitivity, his low self-esteem, and his fears that he will let down his country.<br /><br />And Bertie has never needed help so badly -- his father is dying, his older brother David is too obsessed with his married lover to care about \\"kinging,\\" and World War II is fast approaching. And when the throne is handed to Bertie, Logue must help him get through his coronation, and a vital speech announcing the beginning of the war.<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech\\" takes place on two very different levels. On one hand, it's about an underappreciated prince's rise to become king just before World War II, and the events that led to it. On the other, it's about one man slowly learning to overcome his fear with the help of a friend.<br /><br />Director Tom Hooper really knows to create powerful drama even from seemingly small things, and to evoke strong emotions from the simplest scenes. There are some lighter moments (the hysterical scene where Bertie runs around shouting four-letter words) and some glimpses of Bertie and Lionel's lives with their families.<br /><br />But the strength of this movie lies in the gut-wrenching scenes where Bertie's therapy is put to the test. We see him struggling to speak to his own brother, and it's genuinely saddening when he crumbles into tongue-tied misery... just as it's uplifting when he manages to speak clearly and with earnestness.<br /><br />And since the movie is all about the king, a brilliant lead actor is absolutely essential. Firth is absolutely perfect -- nervous, fearful, stiff, quick-tempered, and always choking on his own words. And you can see how desperate he is to help his nation. And he has a sort of prickly chemistry with Rush, whose energetic, earnest therapist helps Bertie break out of his shell.<br /><br />Bonham-Carter gives a lovely smaller performance as the future Queen Mum, a lady with a steel spine who seems to be propping up her husband until he can stand on his own. And there are great smaller performances by Derek Jacobi, Michael Gambon, Jennifer Ehle, and Guy Pearce (as spoiled man-child David).<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech\\" is all about one man helping another overcome his fear, and the world-changing consequences.

B00081U6EG|1.0|Bonnie Raitt, Eric Johnson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Robert Cray, John Mayer, Buddy Guy, Richie Blackmore, etc. The list goes on. The ONLY REAL and most famous Strat player on this DVD is the Great David Gilmore. And as far as Brian May and his Guild Signature Edition, that no one buys because it's an over-priced piece of junk? He shouldn't have been on stage at all if he couldn't bring himself to PLAY A STRATOCASTER AT A TRIBUTE TO THE STRATOCASTER.    Not recommended because it's Recorded in England. Not in Southern California where it was born.

It has tons of cute pictures and ideas and works great as a starting point for cake pop making. However, you really DON'T need this book because you can get all this information online as well as tons more ideas than what's included in the book. I was hoping it woule include stuff that was not already online, but it does not.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|Not only is Kamelot an amazing band with incredibly talented artists, which means the music on this DVD is outstanding, but the video quality and overall performance of the band in Oslo, Norway during the filming of this live DVD is top-notch as well.  The lights, sounds, and videography are all excellent and the track list features a range of music from several Kamelot albums, all of which fits perfectly in to the chosen mix.  In addition to the great live concert footage, you also get a second DVD filled with special features, including band interviews, a \\"making of\\", and some promotional music videos (including the uncensored version of \\"March of Mephisto\\" which is quite a bit darker than the more TV-friendly version).  This is a great DVD set that is an essential part of any Metal collection.
1582701709|2.0|From a Christian perspective this book isn't telling people the whole story. The Bible say's all good things come from above. Meaning from God. Colossians 1:16 says \\"For by Him (God) all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.\\" By ourselves we can't do anything. We only get what God gives us. Everybody has a different purpose in this life. Some are poor and some are rich. Why is that? I don't know. Only God knows. I'm basing this review on Americans. I know there's people living in 3rd World countries that are suffering pretty bad and it's really out of their control. Us Americans are blessed in this Country. The reason is I believe so we can help these 3rd World countries and share the gospel to them. We are answered prayers to them. The Secret is saying if we think positive thoughts and focus on what we want than the Universe will align with us and give us what we want. The Universe will put us in the right situations at the right time. Why don't they just say God instead of the Universe. They're making them both the same thing. I never said or heard anyone say that they're going to pray to the universe. That would be praying to a false God. God created man and the Universe. Man isn't God and the Universe isn't God either. Anyone that believes the Universe is God will find out when they die that it was God all along that was giving them things on Earth. There's two perfect Bible stories that tells us that we need God that we can't do everything through our minds. The first one is David and Goliath. David in his own powers could never kill Goliath with his own mind and believing he can kill him. When he got there Goliath was laughing at him. David said he came here on the name of the Lord. When he shot him with the sling shot, God super naturally put his forces behind the shot to kill Goliath. The second one is thestory of Joseph. Joseph was lock up for I think 7 years for a crime he didn't do. He cried out to God everyday and at the end of the seven years he gave the king of Egypt a dream that no one could interpret. The only one who could interpret the dream was Joseph. Long story short the King made Joseph second highest king in Egypt. Lesson here is God blessed Joseph not the Universe.
B0038AMW6Y|5.0|This debut album spended more than 26 weeks on top of the Dutch charts and defeated the album Thriller of Micheal Jackson, which held the record of 26 weeks. An incredible achievement for a new group debuting with their first album. Why? It's difficult to guess. But certainly the album sounds fresh and has a breeze of sensitive, cool and something nostalgic atmospheric. At first play I had to think about Dr. Buzzards Original Savannah Band with their hit \\"Cherchez La Femme\\" and Kid Creole. It's a nice set of songs, good musicians, a dj and a superb lead singer Caroline Esmeralda van der Leeuw, her name as basis to the group name Caro Emerald. Fun to play, listen or dance to. New tunes with a jazz, latin, 50ties touch but sounding fresh and vibrant. Something new and remarkable! Check it out!
B00284BNKC|4.0|The transfer from standard DVD to hi-def is acceptable with a fair amount of grain throughout, the bright sunlit scenes being the exception with crisp tones and even colours however, it's the sound mix that will rattle your cage. It has been given a full makeover with details that you won't believe.....That Kronos Quartet score, the drug induced hallucinations, all stunning! The extras don't really differ from the previous DVD release but the DTS audio makes this a must have!!

B002ZG981E|2.0|In spite of some good acting and an interesting and weird premise, this film fails utterly in terms of plot. There seems to be so much set up early in the film that is then never delivered on. For example, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) asks Ariadne (Ellen Page) very early on in the movie to design a labyrinth, as part of her job interview. Later in the movie she's spending a lot of time designing the labyrinth needed for their plans to manipulate Robert (Cillian Murphy)... and then at the height of the story, we never see the labyrinth, and then they're blowing it up for reasons I couldn't begin to grasp. There are many things set up in the film that simply \\"disappear\\" later on.<br /><br />In any case, it's a story that could have been a lot better. The film is visually stunning, at least early on  -- there are some cool scenes later in the film (\\"How did they do that???\\"), but seem very self-conscious. In other words they were included because they are cool. But it feels to me like one of those movies that somehow ended up in screen-writing hell and they finally just gave up.<br /><br />All that said, Leonardo DiCaprio was really super. He was the only \\"real\\" character in the film, everyone else is nothing much more than part of the set. Ellen Page did as good a job as anyone could have hoped, given the miserable material she was given to work with.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|I found the Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'hoole to be a great film. It has everything jealousy ,betrayal, good vs. evil, some whimsical moments and some good story telling. Directed by Zack Snyder (300 & Watchmen and the upcoming Sucker Punch) yes that Zack Snyder. Don't let that put you off though this is not uber violent like the other movies he has done. At the same time this isn't just for kids, as other reviewers have noted may have some scenes that are a little \\"intense\\" for the under 7/8 crowd. Just don't expect some cutesy animated film, IMO this is a film that just happens to be animated.<br /> I originally saw this in the theater in 3-D and it was awesome visually the 3-D in the theater was great one of the finest I've seen so far I had high hopes for the blu-ray and it doesn't disappoint. To say the blu-ray is visually stunning would be an understatement one of the finest looking blu's out there period. It is also available in blu-ray 3-D, I can't however say whether the 3-D blu-ray is worthwhile or not since I have a Front Projection set-up Panasonic PT-AE4000U 1080P with a Carada Criterion Series 120\\" 2.35:1 Screen.<br />The DTS-HD soundtrack is equally impressive as well. I won't bore you with another synopsis other reviewers have covered that quite well. I for one am looking forward to Zack Snyder doing more in this series.
B001992NW4|5.0|Haven't watched this one in several years so I thought I would give it another go around.  I normally do not buy videos as I'm not one to watch a video more than once except on the rare occasion.  This is one of those rare occasions.  I have always said that the Exorcist (the first one) was one of the best horror movies produced. And that is also comparing it to the recently released, taking into consideration that this film was produced 37 years ago when special effects were comparatively primitive. The acting, directing, special effects, etc. are excellent.  I will definitely watch this one again, especially since they've added extra scenes. All in all a great watch for horror fans.
B001N1DPDE|2.0|Upon reviewing the knife's functionality, I have come to a very unpopular conclusion... It is completely hype. The knife excels at virtually nothing and makes for a better crowbar than knife. It is clumsier than a drunk whore with broken heeled stilettos. It can chop... kind of, but I wouldn't call it effective or even satisfactory at that. Get the tools for each job and not a jack of all trades. stick to smaller, more controllable knives and leave chopping and splitting to an axe or a longer and thinner knife. This tool is overkill, and there is no reason to have a bombproof piece of equipment like this that sacrifices functionality for strength. It just isn't necessary.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|Great thriller!  The flickering lights, elevator music, and noises in the dark were creepy.  This was not a scary movie where I find my self picking my feet up off the floor.  This was not a boring movie either.  I liked the detectives attempt to connect the people in the elevator to each other in some way.  Only to get it wrong.  Their only connection was the devil was interested in their soles.  I tried to figure out who the devil was as one of the reviewers claimed it was easy to do.  I guessed wrong.  The characters outside the elevators did a great job.  I even found myself talking to the TV saying, \\"don't do it.\\"  For keeping me interested throughout the movie and making me say \\"wow\\" at the end, this movie deserves my 5/5.
B004132HZS|4.0|I've always enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes genre and this was a well done addition.  The characters grew to keep up with this century while still holding onto what makes them essential. The essentials I am speaking of are Watson being is an army doctor who was shot during a conflict in Afghanistan.  And, although no where near Holmes in observational skills, he's no idiot and also a great admirer of the fairer sex.  Also with Holmes who is a loner, consulting detective who has a tendency to inadvertently turn people away from himself.  Not that he minds.  He has the keenest eye and there is even allusions to a past drug addiction.  The two even look the part, save for the fact that Sherlock Holmes is definitely much younger than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever described.    The modernization of the show is quite clever at times.  In a classic story Holmes tells Watson that \\"this is a three pipe problem\\" and in tis remake he informs Watson that \\"this is a three patch problem\\".  Holmes utilizes every instrument he can, including delinquents, the homeless and the internet.     Beyond that I greatly enjoyed the cinematography and music that accompanied these Sherlock Holmes adventures.  All in all, entertaining and new while still being endearingly familiar.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|Big disappointment.  It seemed like it was going to go in the direction of Dark Angel, but then the movie goes somewhere else.  Then maybe like Alias with some hot butt kicking.  Nope!  She was just focused on spider boy... I guess spider boy was suppose to be her assignment???  I just kept waiting for it to get better.  Just when I thought it was going to get good, they movie goes into a different direction.  It was a flop.  Great actors with bad scenes and difficult to follow.  This movie was constantly getting off track.  And that ending... what was that?  What a waist.  Don't do a sequel Angelina.
1579128149|5.0|This is a book you can open to any page and start reading. I assumed this was going to be a vapid picture book, worth a few minutes and then up on the shelf. Wrong, I've been dipping into this book for a couple of weeks and there's still a lot of elements to go. It's a big, colorful, stylish, accurate, well organized, clever, quirky word/picture book on the elements and their applications. It is not an encyclopedic detailing of element properties, if you want that see Wikipedia online.         Gray is an elements guy, collector, and photographer, and most of the photos are of his wide ranging collection, including many historical curiosities and oddball products. Every element has a full page photo on the left and on the opposing page six or so close up photos of applications and ores (all photos on a black background). There is also a mini-periodic chart showing each element's location and some selected data (always in the same format), plus Gray's knowledgeable and humorous few paragraphs on each element.          I am a technical person (engineer), but paging through the book I found many elements of which I had barely heard. Is that really an element? A lot of the periodic chart is really obscure. I suspect that if a bunch of fake element names were mixed with the names of real elements that virtually no one (except a few chemists?) could separate out all the fakes.         I guarantee that anyone reading this book is going to learn a few things. For example, almost everyone 'knows' that mercury is the only metal that's liquid at room temperature. But Gray (only half tonque-in-cheek) points out that what is meant by room temperature reflects a climate bias, that in the tropics at least three metals would be liquid: cesium and gallium melting at 83 and 86 degrees F respectively. (Francium melts in this range too, but it's so wildly radioactive and self heating that it is academic.)
B001P5HI4A|5.0|In my humble opinion Yentl is Streisand's very best film.  It is done with a perfectionists eye for detail and it's a delight from beginning to end.  I had a VHS version already in my collection but I chose to purchase this edition in order to have the optimum version to enjoy on today's vastly superior home entertainment equipment.  After I watched this edition of Yentl, I was so delighted that I purchased an additional copy as a gift for my son.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|I'll say it; if the best 10 or 12 songs from this cd had been released as an LP in '76 with Because The Night as lead off single the world would not have waited until '84 for Bruce to hit megastar status. Going here for 22 songs (1 song is hidden) means a little bit of filler material snuck in and the later Darkness versions of Racing In The Street and Candy's Boy are superior to the early versions presented here.  Gotta Get That Feeling; Fire; Aint Good Enough For You and The Promise along with the already mentione Because The Night would have made this a major hit in late 76.  Several reviewers have made negative comments about the fact that some of these songs have been tweeked with overdubs or finishing touches for this release. Who care? Why compain about the release being made as good as possible? The Promise has been kept, its a shame it wasnt released 35 years ago.

I'm a casual gamer who plays Starcraft 2 and FPS, most of the times with friends on skype, and I fell in love with this product.

B003NFM3JK|3.0|Actually that quote is from \\"How The Grinch Stole Christmas\\", but can somehow describe the audio factor to this great looking movie by the makers of The Polar Express. There are alot of familiar dialogue to this well story known to all in civilization, but there are also many adjustments for the 3D generation in regards to action and fantasy. Alot of action sequences have absolutely nothing to do with the true story of Ebenezer calamity in adjusting to his new found life as a mortal redeemed in spirit by three wise ghosts who challange him not to change in light of what they have shown him. The overabundance of laughter from the ghost of Christmas present establishes the fact that only Jim Carrey could have pulled that one off without sounding tired of laughing at the end of it.<br />The visual trickery of floating in the room's feast peering outward below to the world as if inside a giant balloon is very effective, and a neat little gimmick, accompanied by familiar Christmas anthem.<br />The only trouble I had with taking Mr. Scrooge seriously as a changed man was I had a feeling he was simply an old crone who was out saving his skin from damnation, and not entirely enthused or having overcome his stupid notions of what life had become to mean to him.<br />In prior roles, for example, I have seen Scrooge actually look repentant, not only to save his skin, but actually wanting to become apart of civilization of which he thought he lost, and was once beside himself to regain it, and for whatever reason he could think of to do it. The ghosts themselves presented him with life of yesterday he had hold dear, the times of today with which he is apart of, and the sights of tomorrow of which he still has some control of if he decides to change his ways.<br />It is these ingrediants that overcome his cold spirit in a matter of a few hours, but the Scrooge presented here doesnt seem to change until he becomes frighted out of his bleak skull by falling from the heavens down to earth by himself, or grasping at the edges of his rocking tombstone eventually falling once again into the bowls of hell. These are the things that have changed this particular Scrooge, not because he has reattached his soul for the better, but rather to find a way to avoid unpleasant results by finding a way to behave from the bitter soul he once was. Never does he shed a tear, of which Scrooge most certainly did so before he became a changed man to the world. And for all the fantastic 3D visuals, this Scrooge remains cold, even in the final sequence.<br />And the three ghosts are the most forgettable ghosts to date, even with the elaborate effects.

B002ZG99NG|5.0|Yes, I hate Boston as a whole only because I grew up a Texas Ranger fan!  But this movie was AWESOME!  Ben Affleck was really a fantastic actor as well as director (and screenwriter) to have put all of this together.  Unlike some of the more 'Salt'ier releases recently released, there wasn't one thing in this movie that challenged the laws of physics...i believed every bit of it and actually was sucked in by it!  Fantastic movie.  I cant wait to get the Blu-Ray copy so I can see all the extras!
B003EYVXXW|5.0|I just watched this movie today, and it was easily the best movie I've seen this year.  All the characters were well developed and I cared for them all.  The heroine was beautiful and a wonderful actress.  This movie was enthralling and I recommend it to all.

B00493AD74|4.0|To put it simply, Eat Pray Love is a movie with beautiful scenery and about a woman who feels unfulfilled and seeks the help of people who seem to be experts on how to live life. Don't expect anything too deep. The writers expected viewers to have read the books and so they don't give us much information as to what exactly causes her to feel such a lack of passion in the first place. Italy (Eat) provides a tourist's dream: good food, good friends, and basically the overall message of living a life of pleasure. India (Pray) is the more serious and the more interesting story here is not about Liz but of the Texan and young Indian girl we see in the movie. The message is meditation and learning to clear the mind. Bali (Love) is where it comes full circle so to speak. She learns that she is finally ready to love again. Once you love yourself, you can be free to dive into the chaos of loving someone else. The messages presented in the movie are things everyone already has heard which is why some other reviewers call it \\"shallow\\" which I can understand. The acting is so great that they bring more character to the screen than what the script gave them [excluding the husband and the actor, the script gave those characters no hope]. I picked Eat Pray Love so that I could watch someone do what I have always wanted...to go to a foreign place and immerse myself fully into the culture and learn some kind of lessons that could be applied in my everyday life. So despite the movie's lack of true depth I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again, just to sit and daydream and wish I could go far away as well.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Best one of the X-men movies - brings all of them together.  Couple of things leave you wondering how they figure in together.  But all in all it was my favorite of the four X-men movies.
B00006JIA4|5.0|It is hard to overestimate the talent that all four members of Queen brought to create this definitive collection of songs.  Queen is great, not just good, in part because everyone in the band contributed his own personal talent to the collective whole.  Freddie Mercury was just the most obvious member because of his amazing vocals, but you would not have Queen without Brian May's distinctive guitar work, John Deacon's innovative bass (think \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" or \\"Under Pressure\\") and Roger Taylor's signature drum work.  All four of them wrote great songs for the band and three of them could sing very well (Deacon chose to just play his instruments).  This three disc set is a must have for any Queen fan. Buy it!
0312600844|1.0|I admit I don't make much attempt to keep up with the latest pop authors, but you've got to be kidding me!  This is a glorified soap opera infused with enough dime-store social commentary to make an Ayn Rand nut ill.  This book was mentioned to me by someone who's taste I used to respect.  I'm not as angry about the 13 bucks I wasted on the download, as I am about the hours I spent scanning through the painfully long scenes thinking \\"OK,OK, I get the stinking point. Move on.  You're prose is not good enough to hold my attention on it's own.\\" To borrow one of the most disgusting analogies from this book; There is no gold ring to be found in this turd.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I will start with the dvd since I love it the most. I am a audio and video guy (I know it is said a lot)! The video and audio are awesome for not being blu ray. These guys are fun to watch and make great music. I can't think of really anything that sucks in this dvd. Well maybe how much they say LB. I know they are from there, and thats not enough to not own this great dvd/cd. What the music is about on this dvd is pretty amazing. This dvd/cd is a must have!! If you don't like it.... well there is something wrong with you. Great everything!
B0035J6TA8|5.0|We're here at the end of 2010, and looking back, this is a strong contender for one of the year's best.  Earlier in the year when I first bought and heard this, while it wasn't exactly a bitter pill going down, it did admittedly feel unusual.  Then I realized I was being like many of the other reviewers who've posted low-rating reviews here, still expecting PG to come out with \\"So, Pt. 2\\", or \\"Still Shocking The Monkey\\" and not willing to accept anything more or less.  But in the same way that oldest fans of the earliest Genesis records must have cringed when PG came up with his '70s and '80s synth pop- and dance-oriented material, we'd never have gotten here without the artist taking those successive leaps and challenging us to follow.  Elvis went from gospel to country.  Willie went from country to \\"Stardust\\"...  True artists pioneer ways into new ground, make a statement on how they see the world, and move on when they have something else to say.    As for the material itself, it does grow on you if you stop looking for \\"Sledgehammer\\" and allow it to.  PG tries to pare down each tune to its elemental core, and burrows into the essence of the lyrics.  Each song successfully demonstrates this, on many levels.  Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" broods in ominously on, \\"...we can beat them forever and ever...\\", then soars in defiance.  Stripping away the original's driving guitar riffs, PG reveals that this has always been so much more than another rebel rock tune with attitue.  Simon's \\"Boy in the Bubble\\" precariously mopes and laments the negative potential of age of technology while remaining hopeful for the poor of developing nations with a plaintive \\"Don't cry, baby, don't cry...\\"  By removing the original's Afrobeat pop bounciness, PG subtly separates the Simon's dual undercurrents of cynicism and the element of fear at the potency of technocratic age.    And so on.  There's enough in every tune to write a full review on, so rich are the layers of meaning as revealed by PG andthe deliberately spare arrangements.  Pure genius.  (The live tour by the way, only served to enhance this, with even further revalations).  Nothing else has approached this level of risk-taking artistry on a large scale this year....    Case in point:  Another iconic figure in western music and pop culture of similar vintage and standing as PG recently released an album of pop-rock classics with full orchestral arrangements.  It does not take even a full listen through to realize that there are no new revalations, no new insights, nor dimensions.  No real growth or evolution.  Relative to PG's \\"Scratch\\", the new album by that other icon (hate to say who it is, as I have deep admiration and respect there too - but think 'law enforcement') is only recycled flash and showmanship.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Settlers of Catan is a wonderful purchase!  It was bought for my college age son as a gift.  (He requested it!)  My teenage daughter and myself played with him Christmas evening and had a great time.  It takes a couple turns to figure everything out and then you're on your way.  It changes every time you play as the game board can be set up in a different configuration each time.  This keeps game play fresh and interesting.  It makes you think while having fun.  My son's birthday is next month.  I think I see an expansion pack in his future!
B00164GDD2|5.0|Great movie, great quality! Just like I remember from the older tapes, it's got a lot of fun features and overall, updated Blu Ray quality only adds to the film's fantastic reworking!
B004CURZFC|5.0|I have been lured into watching chick flicks, or children's  stories retold for adults (like \\"Where The Wild Things Are...ugh) and it is often a tortuous event.  I dragged my feet (big time) on this one, but was out-voted.  I just can't believe I actually enjoyed it! I mean, I really liked it. I would NEVER have picked this one on my own in a million years! If I were to say something negative, I would say that it got off to a tad of a slow start. That aside, this was totally unexpected, and the ANIMATION! WHOA! I just thought it was going to be some fluffy, foofy, silly little kid's thing.  While the kids did love it, I was astounded at the solid good vs evil story, awesome flying and aerial combat scenes. The owls actually look like their speaking. The dramatic depiction of a very stormy ocean... mountains. I can't say enough about the graphic imagery. Just spell-binding.  This is a winner.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really loved tis book! The begining was a bit slow, but this book is so worth it! It's a fairly large book, but don't let it's tickness decieve you-once you start reading it, you can't put it down. I read it in a weekend, and couldn't put it down!  Even though the book is told from Ethan's POV, and Lena doesn't physically appear (but is still there in thoughts) very many times throughout the book, you come to understand both of their proems. Lena struggles with choosing between being a light caster or a dark caster, wile at the same time trying not to hurt anyone she loves. Ethan struggles with possibly losing the love of his life(I know it sounds kind of corny-but its actually pretty good).  Ethan relizes that there's more than meets the eye when it comes to Lena (even more so than before).  I would suggest this book to anyone who has read the first book in this series, Beautiful Creatures, and to anyone who likes books filled with magic and romance and great characters. Or to anyone who just like books.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|I've always been a Glenn Hughes fan (from the Deep Purple era though)and I am impressed with his vocal qualities an performances on this interesting project. Glenn exhibits amazing control of his voice and reaches higher than ever tones. How does he do that at this age? One of the finest musicians alive.   So this project caught my attention because it was born swiftly rather and by enthusiasm of all these people. So it is not a contrived effort put by studios as it is mostly the case, but by the pure desire of fine musicians to do something together. Although the CD was really recorded in a matter of few days (so it is not so polished and shiny) but that's the great thing about it; it is fresh and different from the day to day rock music that's out there. They came up with simple ideas and riffs but it complements Glenn's vocal abilities and he just soars higher and higher as needed to find the sharp moves from the traditional rock chords. It is more progressive but also classic pure rock.  Joe Bonamassa is doing a great job backing and leading (albeit at times being too \\"dirty\\" with the distortion sound). Great solos, great speed and accuracy.  Jason Bonham (the son of...) is an excellent drummer. Very accurate and fast. He didn't have a chance to write heavily in this album (except on one song) but he certainly does a great job through - again -  not the traditional drum bit of the rock trash out there.  Sherinian adds a great Hammond background, but I think he should be more vocal sort of speak, and let the Hammond blend in with more soul and melody.  This is the beginning and I hope they will tour and do more great work like this, as I believe there is room for such a band with such great qualities. You won't be disappointed.

B003LFLPGY|5.0|River Song makes an entrance that will be hard to beat.  The pace begins slow and steadily gains panic until the crescendo becomes a cliff hanger ... to be continued in Flesh and Stone.   The characters of the Doctor, Amy, and River are better developed and word play between the Doctor and River hints their relationship is based on more than the Doctor knowing River's fate.  Overall, an excellent adventure.

B0046IGOIO|4.0|can do a lot of damage. Clapton was once deeply upset by a Rolling Stone review; lots of performers don't bother reading reviews of their work. I almost avoided this Doors set because of what some people wrote about its sound, despite my being an Albert King fan.  I'd like to offer a less, hmmm, unique perspective on this CD package.  Comments like \\"flat-out terrible,\\" \\"very poor,\\" and \\"tinny\\" must come from reviewers who a) are less than 30 years old and are used to ProTooled music, b) have never heard a live album before, c) have never heard a guitar played with a slide before, d) wonder what the word \\"bootleg\\" means, e) have malfunctioning equipment, or f) watch music on audio analyzers. I'm sure they've never heard The Kinks, \\"Live at Kelvin Hall\\" or The Rolling Stones, \\"Got Live If You Want It,\\" which are unfathomably poor audio-wise compared to \\"Live in Vancouver 1970.\\"  The sound is excellent. It's better than most soundboard bootlegs I've heard and better than some officially released concerts (\\"Yessongs,\\" for instance). If anything, there's too much stereo separation, with Morrison too much in the left channel. A more serious point could be that there's some distortion in his vocals, but it's not remarkable, much less offensive, given how important distortion can be in rock music. I hear no \\"muting\\" due to any suspected audio clean-up; tape deterioration is probably at fault for the (very) minute problems I hear. I can't imagine Albert King's guitar sounding any different than it does, which is clear, direct, and deliberate. Besides, what are you going to compare his sound to--where else have you heard him play slide?! Blame Albert, if you will.  Yes, there's a lot of stage tuning. But you also get the whole concert. Grateful Dead fans often complained about the Dick's Picks series because they generally didn't offer complete concerts, and I can understand why. I have the Doors \\"In Concert\\" CD set and \\"The Bright Midnight Sampler\\" CD; they lack that moment-to-moment concert feel of \\"Live in Vancouver 1970.\\" I too program only the music, but I very much appreciate the continuity of time and sound.  OK, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. I find it outrageous that, since the invention of the jewel box, packaging has only gone down in quality, to the point where the compact disc (the most durable recording medium yet invented) is subject to scratches every time it's removed or replaced in many of today's sleeves. Shame on you, Neil Young (the last few albums), The Grateful Dead (the \\"Road Trips\\" series), Rush (\\"Snakes & Arrows Live\\" and others), Kansas (reissue of \\"Two for the Show\\"), Led Zeppelin (\\"The Soundtrack from the Film 'The Song Remains The Same'\\"), Bruce Springsteen (the last few albums), etc. Scratches can affect CDs, sometimes more significantly than LPs, and those paper/cardboard sleeves are very good at collecting the dust that causes the scratches.  If you're interested in either Albert King (who's listening intently to the band as he's playing) or Doors live albums other than \\"In Concert,\\" I recommend this set highly.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I have been a loyal fan of Michael Jackson since I was two years old. When he passed away on June 25, 2009 I was devastated. I thought that the time for NEW Michael music was over, but I was so wrong.<br /><br />Adressing the issue that this is not Michael Jackson singing I now 100 percent believe that there is no mistaking that this whole album is Michael Jackson!! I know how he sounds from previous albums and his sound has not changed, I would recongnize his voice anywhere!!<br /><br />Reguarding the Michael Jackson critics who are saying that this album is over crowed with guest appearences is totally not needed. There are only three guests who appeared on this album, Akon, 50 Cent, and Lenny Kravitz. Not to change the subject or anything, but if you want to talk about someone who has too many guests on her albums trying to overshadow her lets talk about Mariah Carey. Ever since the song \\"Honey\\" that is when her music started changing for the worse (just in my opinion)<br /><br />In closing I would just like to say that if you are a TRUE FAN of Michael Jackson and you miss him you will love this album!! The songs are very upbeat and he is speaking the truth on various topics and I for one will treasure this new album for years to come!! One final note on every song credit in the booklet it says on every one of the liner notes WRITTEN by Michael Jackson, produced by Eddie Cascio. NOW WHAT!!!!
1439133948|4.0|I titled this review EERIE because at every point of Miles' journey as chronicled by LMB I have found strange congruences to my own experiences.    I won't go into those congruences here, but if you have followed Miles then you know that this installment is inevitable.  After all, consider the Warrior's Apprentice:  what sets Miles on his initital journey is the death of this larger-than-life figure, Piotr Vorkosidan.  LMB's descritpion of Piotr's passing has as much to do with his son as his grandson.  From father to son, the Vorkosigan legacy continues.  So is it any surprise really that this father -figure's deth will?
B002HFP0R4|5.0|As a long time Bee Gees fan, this is a  dream come true. The selections and the quality are fantastic. The album is done with excellent taste, pictures, comments, it makes it so cozy like you're a part of their family.

0553808001|5.0|I was in a local bookstore today- looking at all the great books I did not get for Christmas gifts- and I inadvertently walked into the calendar section. I saw a couple that looked mildly interesting (one called \\"wonders of the world\\" for example) and then I saw this calendar. I am a fan GRRM's books so I was immediately picked it up and flipped through it. The illustrations are wonderful (I especially liked the one of the Hightower of Oldtown) and are mostly accurate. They even matched up the castles to months that represent them well. For example, Winterfell is the picture in January and Sunspear is the picture for August. The wonderful illustrations, and the fact that most bookstores have calendars 50% off right now, make this calendar worthy of a 5-star rating.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Loved it, loved it and will love it forever! The 2 CD's are superior quality and the DVD is just the icing on the cake. I would recommend it very highly to any Bee Gees fan or music lover. It's a one CD party for your next gathering:) Absolutely loved it!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Celine Dion is the best selling female recording artist, and this DVD perfectly shoes Ms.Dion at her best.  The show is created by the same man who created Cirque Du Soleil.  Celine has an amazing voice and can really capture her audience.  With the beautiful, \\"A New Day Has Come\\" to the finale of her biggest hit, \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" from Titanic, Celine Dion gives quite an amazing show and will leave you speechless and wanting to hear more! Even if your not a huge Celine fan, You will enjoy it! As a straight, male Celine Dion fan, I really found her show to give me goosebumps as I heard some of her songs.  Unfortunately I was not able to see her show at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas during the 5 year run of \\"A New Day...\\" but I will for sure after this concert, be seeing her next year when Celine returns to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.  5 Stars, Watch this concert, you will be glad you did...
B000MRAAJM|3.0|Absolutely nothing wrong with the product; what I have to lament is the overwhelming 5-star ratings given this program by people who obviously are enamored with the technolobgy and didn't pay attention to the content - the program is not as good as the best of the old National Geographic specials.  Oh my word that National Geographic had this technology when they did the Namib desert, or \\"The Incredible (Human?) Machine\\", \\"The Hidden World of Insects\\", \\"Reptiles and Amphibians\\" etc. etc....  and if Marlin Perkins and the old \\"Wild Kingdom\\" bunch had this stuff the BBC would (probably) not have had the nerve to air this indifferent program.  Oh that the BBC had included that kind of depth and diversity into their special, or at least stuck to one area of the globe at a time.  This really wasn't as good as the Blue Planet - Seas of Life program.  Sure, if you like nature stuff you'll more than enjoy this, but it looks like this was a \\"...hey, this is what our camera crews got, make something out of it\\" type of deal.  Spread much too thin and the premise of 10 different habitats really doesn't work.  And most of the above ground stuff is shot from the air; although much of the content is enhanced by giving you this view it relies too much on the technique.  However, the fault in programming is strictly the BBC's and, though this is only slightly more than mediocre nature documentary fare because of the up-to-date equipment available to up-to-date production crews, for the price Amazon has on the blu-ray it is absolutely worth it because, although quite limited in scope despite the claim of PLANET Earth (a lot of shots from orbit and quite a bit left out), it is still beautiful.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins' atheism is a strange phenomenon in the history of science.  In his writings on Darwinian evolution, he has advanced the science of life forms far beyond the conclusions of Charles Darwin in \\"The Origin of the Species\\" and has proved Darwin wrong in several basic assumptions of his biological research.  The discovery of DNA and its revelation of the genetic lines of inheritance has clarified with astonishing accuracy the substantial truth of Natural Selection and Descent with Modification, even though the scientific basis of Survival of the Fittest has been shown to be an inapt expression for a far more complicated biological engine.       One reads with astonishment and something resembling scientific wonder the universe of biological and evolutionary knowledge revealed in \\"The Selfish Gene\\" and the books that have followed in quick succession. There is no doubt that Richard Dawkins is a master of his craft, his science, and the mountain of learning that he has added to the biological sciences is truly unprecedented in contemporary scientific writing.       So it is something of a mystery why he has turned his facile pen to the subject of religion and the existence of God, since there is nothing about evolutionary science and the scientific data he has uncovered, that even hints that this subject arises from the subject matter of his research.   It is a question tacked onto the data, arising, not from the data itself, but from questions, personal and intellectual, completely detached from the body of his work.       This is demonstrated by the fact that he does not approach the subject of the religion and the existence of God from any objective study of the subject matter, as he does in his scientific writings, but from a basis of revulsion and ridicule.    There is in \\"The God Delusion\\" an intellectual conceit that is overpowering in its attack on all systems of personal belief, as if he were granted some kind of esoteric knowledge not grantedto others.  But that knowledge is never revealed or called upon.  He makes no appeal to evidence of any kind or to reasoned conslusions based on palpable and incontrovertible facts.  The images and assertions that he puts forth are more figures of speech than reasoned conclusions and he seems to believe that bluster, irony and caricature are valid forms of debate.       He is guilty of the \\"evolution deception\\", stating on the basis of his detailed knowledge of micribiology  that the evolutionary process of life forms demonstrates that God does not exist.  No one pretends that the evolutionary process demonstrates the existence of God: empirical science can demonstrate nothing beyond the touchable, the seeable, the feelable and  the demonstrable conclusions that can be drawn from these.  The existence of God is reached by a process of analytic reasoning, which ordinary people call common sense It is the recognition of a cause that adequately explains the existence of the data revealed by the empirical sciences: the whole of reality.  Richard Dawkins' failure to recognize an efficient cause behind the universe is the intellectual obex to his discovery of the existence of  God.     Father Clifford Stevens  Boys Town, Nebraska

B001U3Y5XE|4.0|My wife and I bought this game recently. We have no kids, but do play a lot of board games.  I'm also a huge fan of Lego.  As stated by some other reviewers, this is similar to Pictionary, but with Lego blocks.    There are different difficulty levels of cards.  When we first played, almost everyone took the easiest cards.  However, once you figure out that you don't have to make a scale replica of the picture on the card, the objects get easier to build.    The two complaints that I heard about this game: 1) not enough pieces to build what is shown in the picture; and 2) Not enough cards in the deck.  To address the first: this game is about getting someone to guess what you're building. It's not to build an exact replica!  If you have to build a zoo, it would be overkill to build seven different areas, each with little scale animals, glass windows, bars, paths, people, a concession area, etc.  No, maybe build a little animal and a single cage.  I guarantee that someone would guess zoo.    To the second point, I agree that there should be more cards.  However, you could very easily grab a pictionary deck and use that.  The disadvantage of that would be that you can't see a picture of what you need to build.      We thoroughly enjoy this game. It is great for children and adults because of the varying difficulty level of cards.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Like others, I thought this novel was just okay. Certainly not bad, but I don't get the hype. I was expecting a bombshell, pull-the-rug-right-out-from-under-you ending that never came. There was a sort of \\"twist\\" toward the end which dealt with the fate of the missing heiress whose disappearance forms the book's central mystery, but even that was anticlimactic since what happened to her will already be clear to any observant reader.<br /><br />The protagonist, investigative reporter Mikhail Blomkvist, was such a schmuck I just wanted him to grow a pair. This guy is continually dumped on by other characters, and I kept waiting for him to rip them a new one but instead he ... makes another pot of coffee and mulls it over. Must be a Swedish thing. But this milquetoast persona doesn't gibe with a character who is supposed to be Sweden's most aggressive and uncompromising investigate journalist. He didn't even seem to be in full control of his own body. Is the word \\"no\\" in this man's vocabulary? Various female characters decide they want to sleep with him, and he doesn't seem to have a say in it. I did think it was refreshing that he took older women as lovers. It also doesn't wash that this astute reporter would completely miss the glaringly obvious clue to Harriet's disappearance that lies in the framed flowers.<br /><br />Maybe this cardboard man was meant to be a foil to the Lisbeth Salander title character, someone who apparently has no problem ripping people a new one. But I could never really rally behind her. I get the whole \\"anti-heroine\\" thing, but the character was alienating, alienated, and unlikeable. And like everyone else in the book, she had a cynical approach to sex; I have never read a story with so much sex and so little intimacy. Again, must be a Swedish thing.<br /><br />Maybe it's the translation from the Swedish, but the dialogue is stiff and it's often difficult to tell who is doing the speaking. People don't really talk this way. And like a Quentin Tarantino movie, every character - with the possible exception of Salander - sounds exactly like every other: same personality, diction, etc.<br /><br />Oh, and the coffee references. If I had a dollar for every time a character brewed a pot of coffee. No wonder they were all paranoid and edgy. Stieg Larsson must have really liked coffee. But even though the ending was a bit of a letdown I was still intrigued enough to begin the second installment of the trilogy. And besides, someone gave it to me for free.ry character - with the possible exception of Salander - sounds exactly like every other: same personality, diction, etc.    Oh, and the coffee references.

1449389627|5.0|I have read some of Scott's other writing and know he usually has a worthwhile point of view. I was not disappointed. He does a great job of demystifying the aura of fate/luck/accident/karma our culture gives to innovation. He has a clear and compelling call to action to \\"just do it\\". It is packed with good information and good advice. He verges on cynicism without being negative. It can serve as a useful kick in the rear to get you going again.

The game is cheaply made.  All plastic and the little squares don't stay on the board well.  They move out of place easily.  Best played with 4 people.  Not a sit down and laugh and have fun game. Just another game.

Even if the faces weren't always consistent from page to page, it gives one an idea of what Claire and Jamie or the other characters would have worn, the landscaping in Outlander, and what Castle Leoch looks like.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Before I got this device I already had a Razer Naga. I bought the device with a Logitech G510.    At first, I honestly didn't care for it.(Don't be scared!) It took A LOT of getting used to it. But, in the end it is completely worth it! I can't imagine ever playing an MMO without this device! The joystick is great, and I have so many more, easy to reach keys!    I can't stress the fact that at first, you may not love it. You may actually hate it. But for me, I quickly became best friends with it.
B00454U1O2|4.0|It goes without saying that this album is awesome.  Knew it before i bought it.  However, when I bought a \\"clean\\" version, I expected it to be truly clean--a couple of songs still have words I'd prefer my almost 9 year old not listen to, like bitch and ass (there is also hell, but I don't mind that one so much, although my daughter insists it is also bad.) She is very mature, is familiar with the fact that these words are \\"inappropriate\\" for her, and self-censors when she sings, but still--if you advertise something as clean, it should truly be clean.  I'd buy it again, though--we love, love, love Pink and her fantastic voice and songs.

B004AYCWY4|1.0|While Dawkins might have a knack for explaining complex situations in a simpler manner, he also is quite adept at manipulating facts to suit himself.  Many of the \\"creationist\\" arguments that he attacks aren't actually used by the major creationist organisations. Also, creationists also believe in survival of the fittest without evolution, so this argument is a bit pointless.  Before people say that this book is \\"proof\\" of evolution (something which is scientifically impossible, by the way: we can't prove what happened in the past without witnesses), I encourage them to read \\"The Greatest Hoax on Earth: Refuting Dawkins on Evolution which gives a SCIENTIFIC creationist point of view, and points out several flaws in Dawkins's arguments.  A bit of balanced argument would go a long, long way, and you don't get that with Dawkins...
B002WHT0YQ|5.0|When the original album came out on I was there purchasing the 33rpm disk. It was great, I was a big clapton fan and loved the blues in general. Now that I have this album the picture is more complete. As other reviews described it's important to get the fuller historical perspective of the musical greats playing with one of the key figures who influenced their development.<br /><br />This just left me feeling great after listening to it. Like going back and discovering there was a second CD in the original that you never noticed. It completes the journey while bringing it home.
B000O174CM|5.0|If you enjoy a good musical with an interesting fast-paced plot, then buy this movie. Jennifer Hudson did an AWESOME job playing Effie White. Beyonce was ok, but not as stellar as J-Hud!
B0044XV3R8|2.0|As many reviewers have noted, this three-disc collector's edition (for regular DVD players) forces you to change discs IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE. Instead of laying out the entire film on one disc, this ridiculous box set puts the first half of the movie on one disc and the second on another, for all three versions!!<br /><br />You have two ways to avoid this - either buy the plain-jane original release (no extras, no frills) or the Blu-ray version. Several Blu-ray salesmen seem to be actively monitoring and commenting on a number of Amazon boards urging disappointed Avatar fans to pour all their money into Blu-ray.<br /><br />So instead of paying just $25 for the collector's edition, millions of Avatar fans are now being steered to pay an additional $80 or so for a Blu-ray player, something they wouldn't have bought otherwise. These so-called \\"helpful commentators\\" even throw in marketing crap like, \\"you know you want it\\" and try to convince skeptics that they're \\"missing out on the latest HD\\" by not buying Blu-ray.<br /><br />Give me a break. What they won't tell you is that Blu-ray is a failed format that many people, especially in this recession, see it for the gimmick that it is. Honestly, how many times have you watched a movie on a regular DVD player and sighed, \\"Gee, this movie really stinks because it's not a Blu-ray?\\"<br /><br />These greedy salesmen are no different from the military in Avatar - why settle for trees when you could mow them down and build condos? Nothing is ever good enough.<br /><br />Why not take a lesson from the Avatar - live simply, in tune with Nature, and not contribute to Blu-ray landfills. Buy the no-frills version, be patient, and wait for the 3D version, which will shoot down the price of this current \\"collector's edition\\" scam version to a few pennies in 2011.
B0018O4YT0|4.0|It's the movie that, if you see it more than a decade after it came out, makes you re-evaluate every sci-fi movie you saw over that decade.
B0042U94UQ|1.0|I was hoping this movie would work and still might if you're under the age of 10 and just haven't seen too many animations. For experienced viewers it didn't work because the graphics were at least 10 years behind the times. The characters were moronically stereotypic with a story revolving around a bad guy (and unimaginative twinkie assistants in either one eye or two eye variations) who find their good sides from three really stereotypic girls to the badder rival who  finally gets his dues - end of story. Yes, the shrinking and freezing ray guns have been done many times before.   There was the obligatory catchy music to keep the viewer alert and less drowsy but of all the animal animation movies put out in the past decade this one was really cheaply stealing from the others. Sorry penguins, pandas, rats, shrek, ice age creatures, Madagascarans and other furry creatures but this studio didn't take the time to come up with some of their own production numbers and tunes or story for that matter.   It just felt like a poorly worn and cheaply produced retread.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We absolutely love this show!!! Sheldon is our favorite. Our DVD set came quickly and packaged nicely. We purchased it brand new. When season four comes out it will be mine!
0312600844|1.0|This book is the worst I've read in a long time. That I finished it is a testimony only to stubborn perseverance and maybe hope that it would somehow turn itself around.  It was like being locked in a room with thoroughly detestable people. Like Zashibis, whose review I recommend, I didn't believe a thing that I was being told and if I had believed it I wouldn't have cared less.  The whole thing was artifice and melodrama; not a true emotion to be seen (or felt). That professional reviewers like this kind of stuff shows how disconnected they are from the lives of real people (those unlike themselves).  It reflects the emptiness and arrogance in the business of modern fiction, its obsession with form and neglect of substance; one big circle jerk.

B004GGM444|5.0|So I bought this album on iTunes (don't do it unless you got a gift card like I did, it's $7.99 there). Lemme just say, this album hits hard and sounds freaking amazing. Its not like other electronica, it's dirty and hard. The best songs are definitely \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\" or \\"Rock 'n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain).\\" I'd say it was worth the $7.99 I paid for it so pick this up at $5.99 and crank up the volume.    EDIT: I've been listening to this a fair amount lately and I'd like to add that several of the other songs are good. I have taken a liking to \\"Scatta\\" as of late. Theres a mix of all sorts of music. \\"Scatta\\" is a rap song thrown in with the dubstep and electronica music. Some of it seems more rock but its all awesome.
B003DT19F0|5.0|This is a very cute movie.  I bought it for my grandaughter and we have enjoyed watching it many times.

0571179924|1.0|The book seemed to be overpriced. I was suprised to see that it was such a small, worn out book for that price. I should have known better, and I regret the purchase.
B000ZJTPLG|2.0|This product is ok for private practice and mobility and it does have a decent sound on its own. Two problems though. When you connect your ipod and try to play along, the overall sound of the music and guitar degenerates. Really wanted it to play along with ipod, and this does not seem to be the best product for that. The other small problem is that the battery cover would not stay in place. Had to put a piece of cardboard between the batteries and the cover to create some pressure, which seems to work fine. Last thing, the overall feel seems a bit flimsy.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! The constant action makes you never want to put the book down. The romance in this book is completely incredible! I highly recomend this book.
B002BPQ0Y2|4.0|Rather silly to have reviews for music. Tastes vary so much. What one likes another will hate. Some people are taking this a little too seriously...calling others names because they like this album. You should probably already know if you want to buy this or not from hearing the songs on the radio anyway.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie got to its destination on time. I got for a family for Christmas that we believed would enjoy this movie as much as we did so its a perfect Christmas gift. That is if that person isn't afraid of puppets and such, i know a few that are. It was received in perfect condition and was worth every penny. I would definitely order another movie from this sender again.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|As a Beatles fan, this was a must. It's really great, the sound quality is perfect, moreover we have the possibility of enhance our experience by listening at on a computer.    The cons: the cd cases are sometime too tight and it's a bit though to take out a CD from the case. And the Anthologies are missing...    But overall, 5 stars++
1400082773|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It's amazing to know about our president's past in such great detail. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|Lego sets stimulate creativity and fun for our grandchildren.  This 800 piece set was opened and the book of building plans checked out with much delight by our 7 year old   granddaughter very shortly after received.  Thrilled to find a product girls could enjoy.  An investment in stimulating brain development :)
B0021L8V0M|4.0|I just watched this last night and thought it was great! It starts out with a bang and just doesn't let up at all! I didn't catch my breath till it was over. The ending leaves the movie open for a sequel or two which I would definitely watch. Jolie was impressive. Really good movie.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The writers/producers/directors really need to be horse-whipped. They milked us for 5 years with suspense to keep their ratings up while making us believe all would be answered ... only to have the Sixth Season fall into a meaningless black hole. They should feel as disgraced as they actually are. Shame on them.   For those who haven't already wasted their money buying this final season: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
B00005JGAF|5.0|This group inspired a significant amount of awesome music being produced today.  This group has a level of significance equivalent to Chuck Berry, Elvis, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and any other hugely influential on rock and music in general group you can think of.  This album contains several of their most iconic songs.<br /><br />This is the punk group to which modern punk groups are compared.  Five Stars on the sheer legacy and significance of this album.

B002VPE1Z2|3.0|i bought this for my verbatim acclaim 1 tb hard drive which fits perfectly within it. worksmanship is okay. but im not happy for its varying price. i found the variation between $3.5-$8.5. that's not good..
B003UESJH4|5.0|I have always thought Colin Firth to be a very wooden actor.  However, in \\"The King's Speech\\", he seems perfect for the role.  He plays the stammering Prince Albert (and later King George VI) and does it with panache.  This could be an Oscar winning role.<br /><br />In brief, the plot of the film covers the traumas faced by \\"Bertie\\" when forced to speak in public.  He has an overpowering stammer which he seems unable to overcome.  His wife (Helena Bonham Carter), however, suggests the services of an unconventional Australian doctor, Lionel Logue, as played by Geoffrey Rush.  Logue treats the prince as an equal.  No kowtowing or deference.  Results are all  that he cares about and it is results that he is driven to provide.  Perhaps the rest is history.  The prince/king does eventually overcome his speech impediment and it is no small thanks to Logue.  Indeed, Rush excels as the masterful therapist.  Another Oscar?<br /><br />\\"The King's Speech\\" is a very good film.  It is excellent drama without the need for a car chase or a gun fight.  Rather, it relies upon a good plot and excellent ensemble cast.  Thoroughly recommended.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I got and read this book in I week and I was addicted to it. I love action books and this book scores 5 stars in every bit of criteria I have. If you are thinking about getting this book dont just think, do.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|OK, OK, they push every single button in this animated flick--the villain who turns out to have a heart of gold, the crusty sidekick who comes through in the end, the nasty lady running the orphanage, and the cute little orphans who disarm even the dogmonster.    I still loved it, would put it right up there with the best animated films of the last few years. It's not quite as innovative as Flushed Away or Ratatouille, not quite as stylish as Incredibles, not quite as gross-out cool or witty as Shrek, but it holds its own with a great cast, good storyline and excellent atmospherics.    The plot's straightforward: Gru is an aging supervillain fighting to outdo younger bad guys and not quite making it. One in particular, the very Bill Gates-like Vector, seems to be outdoing him at every turn. To achieve his greatest evil plot--stealing the moon--he must trick three little orphan girls into helping him infiltrate Vector's lair.    What follows is fairly predictable, but so well-done I didn't care if I knew what was going to happen. I just wanted to watch how Gru did it. Bravo.
B00000DRA9|5.0|I bought this album for my daughters Tinker Bell music player Christmas 2009.  Yes, I bought it for myself in disguise of buying it for her, this was probably my favorite movie when I was a child and the music was very memorable to me.  I had to have it.<br /><br />She likes it also.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I ordered this cable to hook my new [[ASIN:B00426C57O Roku XDS Streaming Player 1080p]]. It works great, audio and video quality are great, and the price was especially great. I am far from an audiophile, but I don't understand why anyone would pay $30-$60 or more for HDMI cables at the big box stores, when a $10 cable provides a quality equal to or greater than most of our televisions can produce. I would definitely order this cable from Amazon, again.
1416550550|5.0|Loved it . . . absorbing and sweet.  Good old fashioned reading - story, characters, good writing -- the whole bit!
B003UESJGK|3.0|\\"Love and Other Drugs\\": what to expect?  Well, to be honest, I had no idea.  Perhaps a chick flick?  In fact, it turned out to be more complex and more rewarding.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Randall James, a young drug salesman for Pfizer who seems to be climbing the corporate ladder.  He is certainly a very good salesman.  In his travels, he comes across Maggie Murdoch (Anne Hathaway) who is good looking sufferer of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  They both expect a brief affair.  Slowly, it develops into something more.  However, the affair is hard work.  Maggie is increasingly burdened by what it might mean further down the track as her Parkinson's worsens.<br /><br />Against this backdrop, there is also a sales revolution playing out.  It's Prozac versus Zoloft and then, along comes the modern day's wonder drug, Viagra.  James is great at selling Viagra.  Or does Viagra sell itself?  Either way, his career takes off.<br /><br />Yet, before he finally gets his big promotion, he comes to understand his depth of feeling for Maggie.  The film has a happy ending of sorts.<br /><br />Overall, a passable film.  Better than a chick flick in the style of Julia Roberts but by no means a work of absolute quality.
B000W9EOEC|4.0|Daft Punk is pretty fun, but their studio albums do not compare at all to the live album. Although they seem to have a formula for most of the songs, I'm impressed that it's live and flows so well, which the studio albums lack. However, a few songs run too long and become repetitive. One of my favorite listens!
B00436GNVC|2.0|I'm sorry to have to write this review. But, there is very little to like about this album. The writing is flat. The overall sound is along the lines of the boring, tired, clichéd stuff you hear on pop radio all the time. Since she is the vocalist, I suppose she has to take some of the heat. But I can't really blame her completely. It's obvious she had very little directional input on this one. In fact, most of the time, she sounds bored as hell--with a magical ghost of a spark on the odd coda. As someone else mentioned, her voice is actually annoying at times! How the men behind the curtains managed that with a stellar voice like hers is very hard to fathom. So yes, kiddies, the final coffin tacks are driven home in production. What happens when the \\"modern top 40 sound\\" infects a previously musically healthy singer? Well this happens, of course. Sadly. I hope it's not a terminal case. I sincerely hope that Aimée Ann Duffy can make a swift recovery from her illness and get back to what made her sound so attractive in the first place. The only thing that is attractive on this album is the cover photo. Five stars for that. Two for the contents. Sorry, Aimée. :(
067101756X|2.0|This is a strange book filled with built-in contradictions which I will try to ferret out.  By coincidence, my active duty tour [U.S. Navy] coincides almost exactly with Col. Corso's time in Army R&D at the Pentagon. This does not give me any special insight into the veracity of his account except possibly a general feel for the climate within the military during that period.    To begin, let's assume for the sake of argument, that the Colonel's story is in fact true; that things happened just as he said they did and the whole affair is a huge cover-up. The military, in their wisdom, classified everything concerning the affair \\"above TOP SECRET\\" -- a decision for which the Colonel expresses his approval on several occasions. If this is so, it must still be highly classified, because if it had ever been declassified we surely would have heard about it. The Colonel, on the other hand, appears to have changed his mind since this book blabs the whole thing -- in writing. He can't have it both ways.    When I was in the Navy, I was cleared for  SECRET, and at one point I was Classified Material Control Officer for the ship I was on which included an interim TOP SECRET clearance. Again, this does not give me any special insight into the Roswell affair, but I do know that if you reveal classified material, even after you have left the service, you can be prosecuted. Was Colonel Corso  prosecuted? I didn't hear anything -- if not, why not? Two possible explanations occur to me:    1) The Colonel was not prosecuted, because to do so, the military would have to admit too much. By not prosecuting they are counting on the Colonel being generally considered to be some kind of nut, and they hope the whole thing will just blow over.    2) The Colonel was not prosecuted because the whole thing is a fabrication and no secrets were revealed in the first place.    Another point that bothers me is the descriptions of the aliens themselves. As described, the aliens would fall dead center into the whole science fiction/Hollywood mythology about \\"little green men.\\" Well, maybe they weren't green, but close, they were gray. This is a little hard for me to swallow. The probability that a sentient species from a distant star system, with a whole separate evolution, would in any way resemble us has got to be vanishingly small.    It is said of the ancient Greeks that \\"they turned their gods into men and their men into gods,\\" and I am mindful of the fact that Michelangelo, when representing God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, painted a human being. Science has forced a long series of demotions on us since those days, but are we still falling into that trap? IF there is an intelligent, technologically advanced species out there somewhere, THEN they must look something like us. In spite of what you see on Star Trek, I--don't--think--so. Okay, this is a problem. Here are two possible explanations:    1) The aliens look somewhat like us because they are us (from the future). Corso himself hints at this on a couple of occasions, but seems to reject it in the end. This will require a complete overhaul of the laws of physics, but . . . maybe so.    2) The whole thing is a fabrication and Corso has simply tapped into the popular myth in order to increase his credibility with the masses.    Another bothersome point involves the intentions of the aliens. The Colonel, being a military type, needs to have enemies so he automatically assumes that the aliens are hostile. The hostile acts he lists are the mutilations of cattle, violating our air space, disrupting our communications and, oh yes, abductions! Well hmm, if the aliens are hostile then they must have weapons, and if they have weapons, then we would have to assume that their weapons are as superior to ours as their spacecraft is to our aircraft. So why isn't there some instance of a direct attack? It would seem that they should be capable of overwhelming force, but instead we get this other stuff. Here,again, are two possible explanations:    1) There is no direct overwhelming attack because the aliens really aren't hostile. They are just curious. They are on a scientific mission and we are part of their study.    2) There is no direct overwhelming attack because that is something that everyone would be aware of immediately. Corso can only maintain his little fiction by keeping things on a subtler level that only the cognoscenti, civilian and military, know about.    Have you ever heard of the scientific maxim called Occam's Razor? It reads [paraphrased]:    \\"When given a choice between several explanations for a given phenomenon the one which is the simplest and most straight forward is the one most likely to be true.\\"    Certainly, accepting as true that we are being visited by aliens from another star system (or from the future) whose spacecraft defy the laws of physics as we know them, and whose very existence has been the subject of a massive government cover-up which has been maintained for over sixty years, is very complex. The alternative is that Col. Philip J. Corso (Ret.) is a liar and that's a fairly simple and straightforward explanation.    Of course, if you are a career officer in Army intelligence you don't tell lies, you disseminate disinformation. \\"Disinformation\\" is a word that Corso uses on numerous occasions in this book. It is one of the standard tools of intelligence organizations and I assume that Corso is practiced in its use.    Much of the latter portion of this book is a rundown of various projects that were being pursued by Army R&D while Corso was at the Foreign Technology Desk in the Pentagon. After reading through a number of these I got the feeling that these were summaries he had written at some much earlier time, which he had pulled out of his archives and modified for inclusion in this book. Often it seemed to me that the only change he made was to insert the words \\"and the extraterrestrials\\" everywhere that the original text mentioned the USSR. Sometimes this phrase was left dangling at the end of a sentence or paragraph like an afterthought.    There is one respect in which Corso was very fortunate. He  lived to a ripe old age (over eighty). He mentioned a lot of real people by name in his book, but most of them  were deceased at the time of publication. One exception was Senator Strom Thurmond who was still in the Senate at a very ripe old age (96). It is my understanding that Senator Thurmond originally wrote a forward to Corso's work, but later thought better of it and withdrew it.    Above, I mentioned the possibility that Col. Corso is a liar, plain and simple. Perhaps that is a bit harsh. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say that his book, The Day After Roswell impresses me as the deluded ramblings of an old man.               Robert L. Mason           Mendocino, California
0811875555|5.0|Tangled is a triumph. It may not be Disney's best animated movie ever (I would still give that to Beauty and the Beast), but it's a return to the best of what Disney has to offer the world of animation.    It's no surprise, then, that some of the best concept art I've ever seen went into it. Glen Keene is a legend for a reason (he's behind Beauty and the Beast and Tarzan as well), and his drawings are throughout this book.  They're breathtaking in their perfection and expression. All of the other art is high quality as well, and the written content of the book is great. Of particular interest is the section that talks about the inspiration taken from prior Disney movies. They examined several Disney classics and broke down the visual language of their design. It's a fascinating (though too brief) glimpse into both those films and this one.    Overall, this is probably the best of the dozen or so \\"art of\\" books I have, if only for Glen Keene's art and the breakdown of prior Disney films. I can't recommend it highly enough for people who are into this sort of book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OK. The Battle Royale guy better keep his mouth shut. Catching was hands down better than its prequel. Suzanne Collins did the impossible and wrote a book better than the hit of The Hunger Games.
B001F12J0C|2.0|...and liked them, the movies are a real tour de farce. There is almost nothing in common. I guess Mr. Ludlum fell victim to the smell of money and making anything remotely connected to the book would have required a different type imagination on the part of the producers and directors.
B001EN71DG|2.0|Just another Lucas \\"re-issue\\". The \\"claims\\" of the \\"original\\" theatrical releases included in this set are FALSE. The only reason that I purchased this was because I thought that I was purchasing copies of the un-touched \\"original\\" movies that I saw in my youth. NOT the crap that has been added to, re-released and corrupted countless times...
B00000099X|1.0|Unless you are paying the $500 price tag THIS ALBUM IS A BOOTLEG.  It doesn't say in the description that it's a BOOTLEG.

1594481717|5.0|Welcome to A Whole New Mind--both the title of this book and a spot-on description of Pink's brilliant talent to conceptualize, capture, and convey the shift from the left-brain-led Information Age to the right-brain-nurtured Conceptual Age. Pink clearly traces how the three A's of Asia, Abundance, and Automation have made the coveted left-brain careers of yester-decade increasingly replaceable. On the other hand--or side of the brain--the right-brain specialities of \\"high concept\\" and \\"high touch\\"give a distinct advantage in professional and personal success and satisfaction. Pink beautifully paints the landscape picture of  the right brain's \\"six senses\\" of: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning. Amazingly, he synthesizes together all of these senses to bring us the birth of a whole new mind--a mind needed to \\"make your way across this emerging landscape.\\"<br /><br />The concepts in Pink's book are as engaging as his humor and right-brain-inspired creative edge. (Appropriately, his book presents a masterful mix of left-brain linear logic and right-brain big picture story.) I think this is one of those books that can be read several times over and still evoke  endless wow's, aha's, brilliant's!<br /><br />If you've got a brain and the motivation for learning how think to the \\"tempo of modern life,\\" opting for this book is a no brainer. Or a whole brainer.
0553062182|1.0|I felt like the author was trying to console me the whole time. Like some impending doom was waiting for me, but she was trying to keep me calm until my world exploded. I also expected some revelation about this 'disorder'. However, none was found. All the suspense for nothing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Whoever said they didn`t like it is stupid. This book is a big hit. Harry Potter move over there is a new best in town. Suzanne Collins couldn`t have done any better!
B000ETQR3Q|2.0|My son HATED this gun, and we have nearly every one. The longshot is so disappointing. Jams constantly, slow mechanism, heavy for the weak shots u get. Inconsistent shots. The pathetic front gun handle snaps off all the time, who designed this crap? We ended up keeping the stampede instead. I think that all the glowing reviews here are probably fake. I read them and based my decision on those. If you get this gun, you too will be adding your poor review. The longshot has less power than the stampede, the hyperfire, even the nite finder has more power and distance. It's not so much the weak fire, it's the variable firing and accuracy.  We ended up ripping off that stupid front gun, taking off the barrel, which just retards any power, taking off the stand ( too heavy), and trimming off all excess plastic crap that this gun has.

B0047WJ12K|1.0|This movie is so mediocre it put me to sleep not once but twice. And SURPRISE it ends exactly as you know the whole way through.The first time I fell asleep I rewound the video to see what I had missed, the second time I just let the film end. The movie set up rules to the dreams and then didn't follow them. Why ? If a movie tells the audience this happens if this happens, then it should follow it's own prescribed rules. The concept of the movie was great but the movie itself was a bomb.
1401223176|3.0|Jeph Loeb's Hush is intense. If you are going to go into the book knowing one thing, make it that. This book is painfully difficult to put down, every scene flowing into every other with all the momentum of a train speeding off a cliff.<br /><br />Of course, Hush is more than a collection of fun action scenes, though the main plot's development due to it occurring almost entirely in the shadows of explosions and grand gestures. A large part of this is the narration of Batman's thoughts which frequently color the scene and give information that would be otherwise impossible to convey.<br /><br />Generally, these work quite well, but they bring up two problems. The first is the presence of Batman's thoughts in scenes where Batman is obviously not present. Here, they act as more of an omniscient scene setter, but they are presented in the same style as the monologues, so telling the two apart is impossible. More important is Loeb's tendency to litter fight scenes with thoughts, which works for the most part but can occasionally lead to the odd moment where the action is frantic and Batman's thoughts are contemplative and, by comparison, almost bored, making it hard to really care about the action.<br /><br />For reasons not completely clear to me, Jeph Loeb decided that Hush needed to include every single character to ever see a bat shaped light go off in the sky. As someone relatively unfamiliar with the Batman mythos, I saw a huge number of new faces, but familiarity isn't required as Loeb does a great job of bringing you up to speed in a few quick lines. The characters themselves generally come off quite well, even though most are only given a limited space to develop, and though none of the sub plots are particularly important on their own, they each do a good job of keeping you interested while the main story slowly builds behind them.<br /><br />Of course, there's the inevitable straining of suspension of disbelief that occurs whenever you've got more than one guy in tights on the page at once. For the most part, this is handled well enough with the standard Batman characters. It is at times hard to see how the seventeen sidekicks that Batman's had over the years don't bump into each other all the time, but Loeb focuses on the character's on screen well enough, and gives them enough depth, that I can forgive that. What's harder to forgive are the characters that come from elsewhere, namely the Superman mythos. I'll just say it right here: I don't like super hero crossovers. It just seems silly. Still, when Batman was in Metropolis, I was able to tread the whole thing as a mildly enjoyable cartoon, but even that slight connection was blown apart when a super dog came on stage, and I laughed the rest of the way to the issue's end. Thankfully, superdog didn't make another appearance.<br /><br />By far the most important of the side characters, and the only one to really stay with the story for more than five minutes, was Catwoman, who begins a romance with batman towards the beginning of the story. Their relationship is more commented upon than acted upon, which can be fairly annoying, though fitting with Batman's character, but their interactions do lead to several good scenes and do serve to lend both characters more of a human side than they might have otherwise have had, as well as providing the lion's share of the text's rare breather moments.<br /><br />In the final issues, the main plot that's been, we're told, slowly building the whole time starts to emerge. I specify \\"we're told,\\" because, despite a few out of place events, most of Batman's theories come across as pointing fingers at random and seeing Cthulhu in the shadows behind his dresser. Still, the last issues do a good job of trashing our expectations, and the several layers of reveals at the end had me quite interested in who the villain would turn out to be.<br /><br />As for that villain's actual identity (I won't spoil the particulars for you), I'm unsure if it's a brilliant turn or a cheap trick. If this is one of your first Batman comics, try as hard as you can to guess the villain. You'll never get it, because the villain's scheme relies on an ability wholly unknown to the newcomer, but obvious to the veteran. At the time, I was more than a tad annoyed, but, in retrospect, I'm not sure that's fair. How much of bringing us up to speed is really Loeb's responsibility? If the device is already established in the Batman mythos, I guess it's fair game, so I won't hold the trick against him.<br /><br />The best word for Jim Lee's artwork is iconic. Every frame and character that the man draws is larger than life, from the monolithic muscles under Batman's suit to the fight scenes, which are just choreographed enough to have the feel of a martial arts master but just frantic enough to feel dangerous and unpredictable. Lee's style is, in no real way, realistic, but none of his characters ever devolve into caricature, and he's fluid enough for his super models to feel natural and powerful, fitting into the world rather than sticking out like an overly buff sore thumb.<br /><br />Besides, the athleticism of the characters makes a degree of sense. Providing you weren't immediately shot in the face, jumping from building to building to knock out criminals night in and night out would shape you up pretty well, I think. (Of course, that only explains one aspect of Lee's universal male anatomy, and damn little of his female equivalent, but we'll just let that slide).<br /><br />When it comes to scenery and fight scenes, Lee is equally competent, blending subtle hints that bring the scene to life amidst the more boisterous elements of the artwork in much the same way that Loeb does with the plot.<br /><br />At several points in the storyline events break into several strands, some operating in different chronologies, with the majority of the work of differentiating between them falling to the artwork. For the most part, different color choices keep the scenes distinct and provide each with its own feel, though the washed out palette of the recollections can make telling the details of the scene difficult. That could, of course, be argued as intentional - after all, it's not like we really remember every part of that day twenty-five years ago equally - but whatever the intent, things have certainly gone too far when I mistook the two boys for each other on several occasions.<br /><br />Hush can be a bit hard to take seriously at times, and not all of Loeb's ideas work out with quite as much finesse as one might hope, but the ride is fun from beginning to end. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief for a few hours, you won't want to stop reading until the ending, and you'll enjoy (almost) every minute of it. I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for their first taste of Batman, but if you've got a few Graphic Novels under your belt, Hush is an entertaining read.of your first Batman comics, try as hard as you can to guess the villain.

B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I was introduced to Jack and the special investigators with this book.  Now I will go back and begin at the beginning.
B000HT3PPG|4.0|This a wonderful movie about love and faith and belief in good things.  We watched it with my almost 10 year old who has \\"almost\\" concluded that Santa Clause is really someone other than the guy from the North Pole.  This movie helps one \\"believe\\" in Santa a little longer, even though one may already be convinced otherwise.  I a friend of mine told me when his (now adult) daughter asked if Santa was real, his answer was, \\"If you 'believe' in Santa, he will continue to bring you stuff.  If you don't believe in Santa, he won't.\\"  She continued to believe in Santa for a long time afterwards.  I will NEVER admit to my daugther that Santa does not exist, only that if she believes in him, he will be there for her.  This movie touches on that belief.  Is he or isn't he?   This was the right year for my daughter to see this movie for the first time.  For now, she still \\"believes\\" in Santa and by that I mean, I think she likely knows that Santa Claus is a game we ALL love playing and she still wants to play.  Showing this movie to kids earlier than 4th grade, will introduce the idea of whether Santa Claus is real and I NEVER wanted to go there until I had to.   Enjoy the movie with your older child.
B002VGZDYY|4.0|The gods exist. We just don't realize it, or at least not all of us. But then one day Zues's master lightning bolt is stolen. He blames Poseidon, all because of an ancient vow that he has broken. A vow not to have children with mortals. The demi-gods are too powerful and could potentially overthrow the gods themselves. Percy Jackson, is this son. And not only did he not steal the bolt, he doesn't even know what he really is.    As a result of the bolt being stolen, the immortals launch an attack on Percy to try and get the bolt, either to give it to Zeus or keep it for themselves. When Percy's family and his best friend, Grover, find out they take him to Camp Half-Blood, a safe training grounds for the demi-gods to grow and learn their past and how to defend themselves.    From Camp Half-Blood Percy is given a quest to find out who really did take the bolt to avoid a battle of the gods that would detroy modern civilization in the process. His quest will take him across the country, from New York to LA, from the Underworld to Mt Olympus. He must confront a variety of mythical creatures, some that offer to help, and some that are set on him failing.     This is a great book (much better than the movie, which is actually a completely different story). The characters are likeable and hateable, they are just enough surprises to keep things interesting without being too confusing for the young adults.    4/5

B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception is the dizzyingly complex, fiendishly simple story of a dream within a dream. Within a dream. (Within a dream?) Inception is a two and a half hour movie mostly built up of simple scenes, with clearly defined goals and almost comically overblown action. When scenes are taken with their predecessors, they become almost incomprehensible, characters popping in and out of comprehension. When taken as a whole, the movie makes perfect sense, a tapestry smashed out of order but easy to repair. Even if there are a half dozen readily apparent orders to put the pieces in.    In classic Science Fiction fashion, we begin with an idea: our dreams are vulnerable, and our deepest secrets can be stolen from us while we slept. The idea then comes to define the world, every other element falling into place in its wake. The genius of Inception is how self referential it is. Much like how the characters' dreams are layered, the movie manages to create a layered suspension of disbelief, using our understanding of its opening concepts to get across its twists and gambits.    As Cobb says, the key aspect of dreams is that we feel confident but understand nothing:    \\"Well dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize that something was actually strange. Let me ask you a question, you...you never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.\\"    Inception operates in the same way. Each scene is a hook, forestalling our questions with easily latched onto action. As things spiral increasingly out of control, we get increasingly obvious set ups. We open (after a brief and initially incomprehensible prologue) with spies trying to convince a businessman. Like many scenes in the movie, it could have been taken from Goldfinger or From Russia with Love with ease. There are hints of uncertainties, of course, both minor and major. They are speaking of extraction and dreams, something slightly outside of our adopted thriller framework. Much more importantly, we don't know where they come from or who they are. But, like a dream, we allow them to carry on, allow ourselves to be swept up in the moment and, for a time, to not question.    When the scene ends with yet more uncertainty, and when the transition savages all thoughts of conventionality with a savage blow to the head, the next proper scene gets an even more obvious hook: a timer. Outside the window, a mob is approaching, smashing cars to pieces and hollering for blood. We don't understand what the characters are after, what test Satio is speaking of, what the inaccuracies of the carpet mean - but we don't need to. There is tension, still, regardless of our understanding, and it's through the use of this small scale drama that Christopher Nolan drags us into the bigger picture without needing to show his hand until we're far too involved to back away.    An obvious consequence of learning the rules in such a distended fashion is that the viewer is, right up until the very end, unsure of what's going on. There are times when it seems that we have a complete understanding before then, of course. When Cobb explains the mechanics of the world to Ariadne, for instance, it would be easy to assume that we have the complete picture. And yet Cobb is playing the viewer along with the rest of the team, manipulating us in the same way that they manipulate their quarry.    Such manipulation could, of course, often feel like simple contrivance. When Cobb changes an easily escaped and easily won game to one that cannot be fled and is fraught with danger, all through a few beforehand undisclosed quirks of dreaming, it's easy to feel cheated. Why would they enter if they'd known this? Clearly, the only reason the plot got to this stage is that the creators had no choice but to hold the knowledge back from both audience and characters until it was too late to make use of it.    Nolan, however, is far too good a storyteller to allow himself to be caught stacking the deck so obviously. Because the standard gut reaction to the scene is correct; it would have been suicide for the characters to enter the dream under those conditions - which is why they, like the audience, were not informed of them. By putting the cast in the same position as the viewer, Nolan channels our feelings of betrayal into empathy, letting our annoyance bolster, not detract from, our connection to his world.    Much more than the revelation of the rules is artificial in Inception. The cast is skillfully drawn and well played, but the movie is centered around DiCaprio's Cobb, and Cobb is as manipulative as they come. He has shaped his world for so long that he cannot stop. Dreaming has shaped and dominated his world, and it has separated him from his children. In his quest to get back to them, he will do anything. His earnestness is a façade, his cold ruthlessness often terrifying as he pursues his humane goals.    Character arcs are built on change, and Inception is the story of Cobb - and yet its character arc is split into two parts. Cobb himself does no grow. He has created a prison for his past, a world that he is endlessly trying to superimpose upon reality in which he and his family are, again, one. His problems are worsening, not bettering. Does he grow at the end? That's a question that will have to be left open for debate, his rationalization and realization so intertwined that to draw one conclusion is all but impossible.    Growth can only be found with Robert Fischer. In a bizarre, almost sociopathic travesty of warmth and reconciliation, Fischer is made to reexamine his relationship with his father, propelled into love by lies and gunfire. In the end, the simple chemistry of the cast, the warmth of their interaction, is a calculated thing. The movie's emotional core is a lie. The ultimate moral realization a fabrication, as Cobb and his team play god with another's emotions:    Cobb:We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.     Ariadne: We're going to destroy his one positive relationship?    Eames: No, it repairs his relationship with his father, thus, exposing his godfather's true nature. We should charge Fischer a lot more than science for this job.    That is not to say that there is no true feeling in the movie, but rather that what genuine camaraderie there is is passed aside and gradually pushed towards irrelevancy. The friendship between Cobb and Arthur is never reflected upon but is unmistakable. Arthur is aware of Cobb's eccentricities, whether the quirk in question is a dislike of trains or an obsession with a dead wife. As the movie progresses, however, Cobb sorely abuses their bond. He lies to and misleads his friends, putting them in grave danger. When his team falls short of his impossible expectations (expectations that he, too, is unable to live up to), his reaction is not sympathy but rage. Cobb's callousness leaves our sympathy to him tinted with anger, hoping that his flaws won't lead to the undeserved deaths of those around him, those that trusted him.    DiCaprio is far from the only effective actor. To me, every character came off as vibrant and alive. Cotillard's tender insanity is brilliantly portrayed, and she's magnetic in every scene that she's in. The minor characters are just as strong. Rao's Yusuf, Gordon-Levitt's Arthur, Hardy's Eames, and Watanabe's Saito are all captivating. Murphy's role as Fischer is, in many ways, the emotional core of the film, and he manages to appear vulnerable enough to gather the audience's goodwill, turning him from gullible dupe to proper player.    Finally, I've heard some people complaining about Ellen Page's performance as Ariadne. From what I can gather, the complaints basically amount to: \\"but she was in Juno!\\" If there's some basis within the actual film for the criticism, I can't see it; Ariadne's sympathy and desire to help is powerful and only made more so by the many situations in which she's rendered ineffective.    I mentioned before that the individual scenes of Inception function as hooks, but to leave off there would be superficial. Every aspect of Inception is over the top - and excellently so, at least for the most part. It would have been easy for Nolan to try and keep the action realistic, but to do so would have left his fantastic landscapes feeling almost pedestrian, their potential untapped. As Eames remarks when he conjures a grenade launcher with which to destroy a half dozen attackers, \\"You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.\\"    Of course, every scene is not equal in its excess, and the action scenes that fall into the uncomfortable dead zone between stylization and realism often come across as simply silly. Still, for every unconvincing gunfight, there are two moments of delightful imagination. The film's highlight is the gravity and mindbending scene where Arthur and a succession of projections battle in a hotel where the rules shift all around them.    The actors and the writing are matched by the special effects. Of course, to say that a modern movie has good special effects isn't to say much at all. 2012, after all, looked great, but I doubt that anyone would hold it up as exemplary in any way shape or form. Inception, however, is the rare movie that understands how to use bombastic effects in order to augment script and character, rather than using writing as a means to simply set up larger explosions. Here, explosions and distortions are expressions of the bizarre's intrusion into our sleeping world, and slow motion is the ramming home of time dilation as plotlines are dragged increasingly apart.    I'm tempted to go on for another thousand words and discuss implications. It's hard to not offer my own theories, to refrain from circling spinning tops and mazelike city streets, faceless organizations and actors' ages, cryptic phrases and circular story structures. But to doso would, I think, to be to overstep my bounds. Inception is a movie that simply has to be seen. There are a myriad of different realities contained in these scenes, and each of them demands to be seen, understood, and either embraced or rejected as you barrel through. So go out and buy Inception. Watch it, maybe watch it twice. Then perhaps I'll get to work telling you why your theories are all wrong.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I am so glad I booked this flight.  This series was amazing, the last season was excellent, and the very last episode was incredible.  It is unfortunate that not everyone who went along on this trip had a positive experience at the end.  The meaning of the series was existential and spiritual, and I think anyone who could take that kind of view loved the end.  In Zen, it is said that everything must be turned and returned to one's self.  William James said that regarding religious experience, first there is the experience, then there is the interpretation of the experience.  A Course in Miracles says that perception is a mirror!  I am grateful to everyone who participated in making this series, and everyone else who went on this great journey.  Thank you!

B000XUBFE2|1.0|After reading all of the positive reviews of this book, I really expected to enjoy it.  I read it mostly because my 11 year old son wanted to read it and I needed to see if it was appropriate for him.  I had to force myself to get through this book.  i allowed him to read it, but he started and stopped a few times, has never really gotten into it either.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|Haunting yet riveting book.  Took some getting used to since it was being told by a five year old boy but the author did a great job of telling the story of abduction and adaptation through the eyes of a child who never saw the real world until he was forced into it.  Definitely puts some things into perspective for you and makes you realize all the things we take for granted.

B00006JSBB|5.0|There have been many reviews written years ago about how impossibly epic this album is.  With some new people just getting into Blind Guardian thanks to \\"Robot Unicorn Attack,\\"  this review is more or less just re-assurance for them.  If you thought \\"Battlefields,\\" owns, please be assured the rest of this album absolutely kills also.    Read previous reviews to get the track by track bios and be assured they are right, if not a bit fan boyish on occasion(which hey, it happens when you really like something).  Once you have the album you can be certain that EVERY BG album is generally kick ass, even their \\"Live in Tokyo,\\" album.  These guys are legendary, if you are into power metal, or just good music in general, you should probably pick this album up promptly.
1853262390|5.0|There are many things that make Orlando a special book. First there is the fact that it is a Woolf book that is purely fun and romantic, and void of the trenchant tone of her other books. It is gorgeous, challenging farce, nothing more. Then there is the typical Woolf language, a stunning eye for detail, and rare and particular introspection about gender and identity. Then there is the novelty of the story itself, and how it embraces its matter-of-fact peculiarity. Woolf only rarely goes off the deep end here, and the story overall is mostly beautiful and keenly interesting. Fans of the wonderful Tilda Swinton movie will be reassured at its fidelity to the book. Fans of Woolf's canon will find this one of the more simply enjoyable books out there, but also a worthy addition to world literature in spite of its breezier attributes. Full recommendation.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is three years old, this is a classic I don't know off to many people that have not seen this movie. Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice the music is brilliant the movie is great no wonder the is a 45 year anniversary pack. Enjoy this movie for what it is - a lot of family fun.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Saw this movie on Christmas Day in a surprisingly packed theater.  My fellow patrons were all mature adults such as myself.  First ,it was refreshing to see a movie with a noticeable lack of such  things as over the top special effects, machine guns, car crashes and actors  picked on the basis of their mass appeal to teens.  It was a movie with a simple story, simple resolution.  It also had some of the best acting,direction, set design, I have seen  recently.  Made the movie totally believable.  By the time the movie was over, was totally blown away.  Today,day after seeing film, asked Amazon to notify me just as soon  as Blu ray is available for purchase.  Also am considering returning to the theater for a second viewing, which  would be first for me  Look at the date of this review, by the time I  purchase it, a lot  of awards will be received by this exceptional movie
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I'm pretty sure I was supposed to read this at some point or another in my school career, but I didn't.  I downloaded this for free to my Kindle, and read it in one day.  It was a great book, wonderful classic, and for the 3 words I didn't know, it was nice to have the built in dictionary of the Kindle tell me what they meant!  Everyone should definitely read this in their lifetime.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|While the previous four seasons of the series were outstanding, the fifth season really \\"raised the bar\\" with the storyline about the Apocalypse with Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles, along with the assistance of Castiel the angel (Misha Collins) and Bobby (Jim Beaver) taking on the minions of Lucifer, an assorted armada of angels, and the assorted regular crew of \\"things that go bump in the night.\\"<br /><br />This season sees some inspired casting with guest appearances that include former TV heartthrob Chad Everest as an older version of Dean, Paris Hilton as a demonic version of herself, and former Stargate SG-1 alumnus Michael Shanks as one in a town filled with religious-demon-fighting zealots.  In addition to these memorable special acting turns, the season also features outstanding performances from actors in recurring roles, chief among these are Kurt Fuller as \\"Zachariah,\\" Mark Pellegrino as \\"Lucifer,\\" Richard Speight as \\"The Trickster/Gabriel\\" and Mark Sheppard as \\"Crowley.\\"<br /><br />Episodes of note include \\"Fallen Idols,\\" with Hilton; \\"I Believe Children Are Our Future\\"; the award-worthy \\"Changing Channels, parodying shows from \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" to 70's laugh-track-laden sitcoms; \\"Swap Meat,\\" a great tale wherein Sam unknowingly exhanges bodies with a teen-aged aspiring warlock and acting kudos to guest star Sarah Drew as \\"Nora\\"; \\"99 Problems\\"; and \\"Hammer of the Gods,\\" a wonderful foray exploring \\"gods\\" of world myth.<br /><br />The special features include all web-isodes of \\"The Ghost Facers\\" and \\"Supernatural: Apocalypse Survival Guides,\\" fascinating documentaries culled from other sources, including PBS.

B003VS0CXS|4.0|I bought this for my daughter who is three years old, I remembered how much fun it was when I was a child. She loves the dancing and singing and Dick Van Dyke does put a lot of fun into the movie. Enjoy to movie for what it is - a lot of family fun.
0061537969|5.0|In my 60 years of reading books, this is one of the best books I've ever read. Love the way Garth Stein compared life to the sport of racecar driving. Enzo, the dog narrator, is very perceptive. And, I'll be reading this book again.
0307595579|5.0|My husband and I had tremendously enjoyed Steig Larson's first book in this trilogy, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" So for Christmas I purchased this boxed  set for him from Amazon. I paid $39.50 for it and later saw it at Border's for $99.95. When it arrived I was thrilled. It was a beautiful set, exactly the same set Border's had been selling. I realize this is supposed to be a review for the book, however I can't help but tell everyone how great it was to find this terrific buy here, that I never would have found anyplace else.    P.S.  The shipping was free!
B000AO4NJA|4.0|I purchased this album due to my parents and during the holiday they love to dance to the classic oldies and Sam Cookie is one of their favorites. My family and I dance and sang to this CD for most of Christmas afternoon. We loved this cd.
0399536108|1.0|I felt I wasted my time and money on this book. The author ends his  book with such non-conformist ideas as: \\"Students could revolt and change universities...Grading could be abolished or modified...\\"; Communities could abolish 98 percent of homelessness by allocating enough space for \\"tent cities\\" and free shelter for up to one year; Prisons for non-violent offenders could be \\"open\\"centers where the occupants check in every day before going to a supervised job..\\".  Universities with no grades, tent cities and open center prisons may be creative non-conformist options but not ones I agree with. This book offered me little in the way of valuable and unique information.
1603420398|5.0|I bought this book after buying a similar book that just had granny squares in it. I like this one because it has an index in the back of the book of many crochet stitches, and a quick guide for beginners in the front of the book on crochet basics.<br /><br />Since the projects are small, they're good for starting, rather than jumping right into making an afghan or garment. The different motifs can always be put together later on for a larger item.
B004DCB62M|1.0|Many illustrations in this book are corrupt.    And there is no real table of content, which means completely disaster for such a big book.    \\"Active table of content\\" is hyperlink. -- This is something like cheating.    I heard Amazon.com cared about customer satisfaction, then please stop selling this book, at least take a look yourself,  you will agree with me.
B000TVBIYC|5.0|We absolute LOVE Lego Duplos and we play with them every day!  Switching tracks are a must to make the railroad building more fun and functional.  Like all our Duplo supplies, these are perfect.  Be warned, however, that if you have the older model chassis \\"train cars\\", they do not work with the switches.  They work just fine with the tracks, but they get caught up in these switches.  The newer model train cars, however, work flawlessly.  Usually cheaper on the Lego website...but occasionally they are out of stock there so you have to come back to Amazon to buy them if you need them in a certain time frame...
B000002O96|5.0|I bought this because it has Howlin Wolf on it as I was looking for some album with Howlin Wolf, but furthermore, he is singing with Muddy Waters - another bluesman that I love.  There is also another great on the album, whose name I can't remember right now.  Overall, it is pretty good - I like it, but I find that each artist loses some of his classic signature notes when performing together - in other words, in many of the songs on this album , they sound good together, but I also think each artist sounds better performing alone.  Unlike the classic piece that John Lee Hooker does with Bonnie Raitt and Santana.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Best new show I've found in a long time.  Hilarious but heartfelt.  It's family-based so the kids can watch with you, but it shows the crazy, messed-up side of the family dynamic that is usually left out.  I recommend this to anyone that has ever thought their family was the craziest in town.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have trouble with any of the earphones I've tried as they don't stay in my ears.  These are the only ones that do. They also keep my hair out of my face so they serve double duty as a head band.  I use them at the health club. I sweat and don't want the big headphones that cover the ears. The sound quality is not so critical.  If it was that important, I'd use noise cancelling earphones.   So all in all, these are just fine.  These were difficult to find. So when I found them on Amazon, I bought 2 pairs.  And you can't beat the price!!

0525951652|4.0|This is the first volume of Follett's new Century trilogy, and with 980 pages it's a big book.  The work is one of historical fiction which is always my cup of tea.   It is a story of the lives of six families in five countries during the 17 years beginning in June of 1911, a period of time which encompassed the first world war and the Russian revolution.  They are the Dewar family, a political dynasty of Washington DC; the Vyalovs a family of Russian immigrants now well-to-do with businesses in Buffalo NY; The Fitzherbert's of  English nobility, landowners and one of the richest families of England; the von Ulrich family a Germany a family with a diplomatic and military heritage; The Williams family, a family of miners from Wales working in mines on land owned by the Fitzherberts; and the Peshkovs a poor Russian family.  The story began on a day in June 1911 when 13 year old Billy Williams started work in the coal mine in Wales, an event which happened to coincide with the crowning of King George the Fifth in Westminster Abbey in London.  There was no middle class in England and Wales at that time.  There were the working class miners, who barely made enough to eat, lived in small unheated houses owned by the mining company, and were treated like slaves by their bosses; and there was the upper class who lived a life of privilege and extreme luxury.  The Earl Fitzherbert was an extreme example of the latter, with considerable land holdings in England and Wales, a house in London, a seat in the House of Lords and married to a Russian princess who in turn owned vast areas of land there.  The time was 1911 and the peasant labor forces everywhere, mindful of the inequity of their circumstances were beginning to demonstrate their discontent in a more forceful way.  Labor unions in England were flexing their muscle, the peasant workforce in Russia were tired of the ruling class and the apparent lack of concern for them by the ruling Romanov family and Tsar Nickolas, and in the Balkans,the peasants were tired of the iron fist rule of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor and wanted independence.  It was there in 1914 that a Serbian peasant in Sarajevo shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne who was on a state visit to that city.  Imperious Austria, determined to reassert its dominance, quickly declared war on Serbia.   Russia had a mutual defense agreement with Serbia and Tsar Nickolas was persuaded by his military leaders to mobilize the Russian army in preparation.  Germany, ruled by Kaiser Wilhelm, nervous about there being an armed Russian military and obligated to its neighbor Austria, then also mobilized its military but at the same time tried to persuade Austria to not invade Serbia.  France then in an act of self defense, and always distrusting of its militaristic neighbor, also prepared its forces for a possible war with its arch enemy Germany.   So they stood for days armed and ready, waiting and hoping for the diplomats to work things out.   Austria however, determined to teach a lesson to their upstart in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, invaded the small country of Serbia and with the Guns of August, all hell broke loose.  Germany followed a long prepared plan for a war in Europe, decided first to invade France and to do so they marched through the non-aligned country of Belgium.  It was this invasion of Belgium which brought the British Empire into the fighting.  So it was that by August of 1914 the countries ruled by George the 5th of England, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and Tsar Nickolas of Russia, three men who were cousins and all descended from Queen Victoria, together with France, were at war over the assassination of an Austrian Archduke whom few people even knew, and fewer liked.    It would be a war in which tens of millions would perish.   All of the fictional families in this story became involved in various ways in the war and in the civil struggles which followed.  The author, Ken Follett, a well respected writer of historical fiction, has done his usual skillful job of weaving the lives of fictional families into the well known events of the time making for both an interesting read and a neat way to learn the history of Europe during the beginning of the 20th century.
B000071ZZI|5.0|Although this was a fiction movie because even spiderman would have a difficult time surviving what Matt Damon went through,it is also realistic because the CIA recruits top notch people with gifts (either intelligence or athleticism/physical abilities) for covert, often dangerous and illegal opperations and then either discredit or kill the recruits.  I would rate this movie in the same category as \\"Clear and Present Danger\\", and \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" as top CIA movies.
B0042816YK|5.0|This is a movie of great depth... So many critics show they don't have a clue about spirituality! This shows so much on the growth of a woman who took the courage to grow and improve her live.  Julie Roberts is always amazing and so spiritual.  If you have a spiritual mind and open it up, then this is a movie you will understand.  Sorry for the people who think this is boring.  They have a long way to go before they wake up to life and what it has to offer.  The true meaning.  So much is shown in this film, if you watch, listen and process it, then you will learn a lot!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Went to see the movie and then ordered the CD, it is just soooo good and it is a must have...p.s. I will see the movie again and again...a classic!
B002ZG994U|1.0|Basically no plot. The action shots are incredible, but it still was a complete bore. Jessica Beil maybe gorgeous but lacks any and all ability to act and does NOT fit into the role of a \\"tough\\" military type, it truly was painful to watch. I expected so much more... DISAPPOINTED. My opinion: Skip It
0385504225|2.0|Signature Dan Brown scavenger hunt  formula with an implausible bad guy taking everyone for adrenalin pumping ride through Washington D.C.  in search of relics of Masonic brotherhood. I was going to give it a pass, but then I learned that it references The Intention Experiment. The female foil for Professor Langdon's encyclopedic lecturing has devoted her life's work to intention experiments; she gets a cool lab away from all possible interference in the catacombs of Washington Capitol building. Here she has performed experiments similar to those described in Lynne Taggert's book. Her work is finished and premise of the book is that her discoveries will change human consciousness and we will all become one with the universe and clean up mess we made. (Assumption being that scientific proof is what stands in the way of humans actually doing the right thing. Hasn't happened yet in our social policy making.)    And that's as far as it goes. Rest of book is spent chasing after madman who wants to keep this information from being dispersed (because he is working with Dark side). Once all that is dispensed with, we can return to our heroine in Chapter 132 for a soothing discussion where theology and double meaning of the bible meets noetic science. All pretty lightweight, but a nice introduction to the ideas of interest. In fact the book should just start there and carry forward into a New Age romance novel for the Eat, Pray Love crowd.    As it is this is basically caffeinated junk food for the brain illustrating that men think very highly of themselves and their symbols. Cliffhanger style is good for a masochistic read if you must read something i.e. in the emergency room where you need to keep mind off things.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is one of those charismatically heart-wrenching books which completely surprised me. It is short and the perspective seemed, at times, annoyingly juvenile. However, the plot is enthralling and the message beautiful.
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith seems to be someone who finds it hard to share her feelings, at least judging by her many pictures in this book: not one shows much more than a kind of even stare, except the one with her daughter, Jesse. So I give her great credit for writing such a self revealing memoir of the life she shared with Robert Mapplethorpe, and of their mutual love.  Even the few mentions of Jessie and of Fred, her husband with whom she eventually moved on in life, are mostly in conjunction with later meetings with Robert. There is a kind of tragedy there, but also a sweetness that somehow permeates this whole story. It's almost embarassing to read it, but also fascinating, as if one were overhearing lovers in their intimacy. Highly recommended!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I love a movie where the ending is unknown, and this movie did the trick. Not only do I give Angelina Jolie a standing ovation for this role, I give Philip Noyce two thumbs up on impeccable directing. This movie truly is a gem! Everything from the intense action scenes to the waredrobe and makeup was spot on and added nothing but the perfect mix to this movie. I would suggest this movie to any moviegoer. This is a MUST SEE/MUST OWN!
B000H6SXMY|1.0|This seller took my money right away, and NEVER delivered the product.  They never answered my emails asking \\"where's my stuff\\"  I believe Amazon knows this seller has done this to several other people, and doesn't do anything to stop it from happening a gain.  Life is hard all over right now.  I need my money back.  I would recommend NEVER, NEVER buying from this seller, and I am totally disappointed in the Amazon.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|This movie flowed very well, and with such big names all competing for the spotlight it was very well balanced. It is most definately a chick flick, mostly surrounding the \\"romance\\" department. A movie that I can watch over and over and still fall in love every single time. I love that Jack Black adds a little extra spice to the cast :)
0312427646|4.0|A lovely short book for lovers of literature.  This book imagines the Queen stumbling upon a traveling library and falling in love with books and reading.  The newfound passion leads to changes in the Queen's habits and her general demeanor/thoughts.  I often find I want books to keep going but, somehow, this one felt satisfying even though I spent only one evening with it.  Four stars easily, maybe even a little higher.
B003L20ICE|4.0|Indie films tend to examine angst-ridden families more than any other genre. Famous examples include: The excellent ensemble piece The Royal Tennenbaums, the consistently morbidly amusing Igby Goes Down, the sleek, satirical Little Miss Sunshine, the shaky-cam shot, rather bland Rachel Getting Married etc. Indeed, it seems that family disfunction is a staple these days and with good reason, virtually  everyone can identify with oddball, quirky, sometimes ostentatious family members. The Kids Are All Right is an attempt to cash in on that particular facet of the canon, ultimately to pretty entertaining effect, even if it doesn't bring anything wholly original to the dining room table.          The film provides us with a duo of lesbian protagonists, for that little extra sizzle. I found this a refreshing twist and Annette Benning and Julianne Moore give understated but realistic performances. Annette is a hard-nosed nurse who might be an alcoholic and Julianne is such an ex-hippie, free-spirit type it is slightly unbelievable the two fell in love in the first place. They raise two less-than-eclectic children, a very pale girl and a sports-oriented boy in a nice house in L.A. One day, the kids look up their sperm donor father, the always reliably and charismatic Mark Ruffalo, who enters their lives and brings all sorts of calamity down on an already shaky dynamic.           There is sexual tension between Julianne and Mark's character that the movie explains with her need to find someone who was is more interested in her than consistently distant Annette. This doesn't seem to be enough to convince this movie-goer. Is she bi-sexual? Also, a sub-plot with an abusive relationship between the son and a friend arises and then disappears. Come to think of it, there is a rather unsatisfying plot-line with the daughter as well, as she tries to find the ability to make the first move with a lifelong guy friend at her slutty girlfriend's behest. Sound a little commonplaceand familiar? It is.          Essentially you will be watching the film to see what happens to the marriage between Julianne and Annette as they struggle to deal with \\"interloper\\" Mark's influence, as the kids' respective dramas leave something to be desired. There are plenty of scenes of adept dialogue. A conversation about the benefits of Acai stands out, for instance, as does a subplot dealing with organic gardening that launches Annette into a fun \\"anti-healthy\\" tirade that will leave those of us healthy eaters who aren't exactly composing fiends a little tickled. Though not as consistently self-aware as other films of its ilk, nor as original (or well-developed), The Kids Are All Right stands out because of its hearty performances, particularly the three adults. Mia Wakowski (sp) is okay as the daughter and the son is largely forgettable. Frankly, they are just not given enough to do.         This is an easy-going, sex-filled tale of contemporary Californians doing their best to stay entertained and to love one another as life changes around them. It succeeds as such, but don't expect the sassy, artistic charm of The Tennenbaum clan or the moribund giggles of Igby's descent.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I was dragged to watch this movie by my comic book loving boyfriend. He has made me see most comic to movie films and while I like a handful of them, most of them I just casually like. This movie was different. It had a style that isn't seen in most movies. The lay out of the movie is much like the Spirit. I didn't care for the Spirit that much but in the same way they create that story with the back drop as if it were a true comic book, they did the same for Scott Pilgrim.     I was laughing the whole time and found this to be quite hilarious. Definitely see it if you play a lot of video games from the 90s and you want a mindless movie. This has got to be one of Michael Cera's best works yet.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was suprised how big this thing is. Fits in my Antec 300 case with no issues though. If you've never used a universal mounting bracket, the install can get a lil confusing, but its not rocket science. It comes with thermal paste, but i opted for the arctic 6 stuff. CPU temp (i5-760 OC 3Ghz) under normal load of web browsing and general use hangs around 32-33 degrees C.
1409114406|5.0|This title was a gift for my boyfriend since he loves paperback and Michael Connelly books. He got it for christmas yesterday and was absolutely thrilled to receive it. Now getting the book was not so easy. I ordered it in November and didn't receive it until the 23rd of December, but the company was very quick to respond to my complaint and sent me a replacement completely free and I received it in less than a week after they reordered my book. So it was a little bit of a hassle, but I got a good outcome and one happy boyfriend for christmas at the end.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|my daughter is a total gleek but didn't get into the show until halfway thru season 1 so i knew this would be the perfect gift for her.  with a tight year financially, i priced the complete first season in every single store then someone suggest amazon.  omg, no kidding same dvd set at half the price! no lie, half the price! thanx amazon for making such great deals available to the hard-working single moms out there!
0425200450|5.0|What a find! I am a Christie fan, a NEW one and this mystery is among my favorites.  It is true, the movie and story are famous, so the ending is not a surprise.  Still, it led me to buy a few of the smallish paperback novels and they are much better than the made-for-television movies.  The characters come alive much more in print, and the humor much sharper.      After reading this, do read _The Murder of Roger Acroyd_ and after all the others, _Curtain_.  The endings to both are not easy to guess, but the last will send you into mourning, just like countless others, I'll bet, when that book came out years before us.

0061992860|5.0|I am extremely fond of this book. It's a great addition to my survival kit (bug out bag) that I am building. I enjoy looking at the pictures, (colored pictures) and learning about the things inside. The size is something to consider though. Sometimes, for some, it is potentially hard to read. But, then again it fits into smaller survival kits very well. In my kit, size is not a problem so it doesn't necessarily matter, but it is great to stick in your pocket. Even if you know everything inside that book, it's great to pass time with. Especially in a survival situation. For the quality, the topics it covers and how it covers them, as well as the price it is a great buy. Don't forget this next time you need a good gift :p
0307595579|5.0|All 3 books as a set are a must have. They kept me so involved, I didn't want to put any of them down. After the first one was read, I immediately went to the second then the third.
0307592839|2.0|I have read Jennifer Egan and enjoyed her work.  This book had been on my amazon wishlist for months so when it showed up on no fewer than three \\"best books of 2010\\" lists I immediately downloaded it to my Kindle.  It is supposed to read like a collection of short stories that relate to each other.  By the time you figure out how they relate to each other, you just don't care.  Some characters are drawn out in full detail; others are so hazily sketched that you can't wait to be done reading about them.  It bounces around from past to present to future, but the future is incredibly contrived.  Ms. Egan needed to get something to link up her stories and end this dreary book and she did so with this inconceivable last chapter that just keeps reintroducing characters as well as throwing a few more in.  The characters for the most part are extremely repulsive and they know they are. Every character borders on tragic.  Every character is miserable (exept maybe Lulu who just really wouldn't exist except on the pages of a book) What may have been the most interesting chapter is the 'power point' chapter which is almost completely unreadable on the Kindle.  It introduced Sasha's daughter and gives some insight into what became of her from her daughter's point of view.  Why we needed a power point presentation (even relevant in the year 2020?) to tell the story is beyond me.  And since it can't be read on the Kindle, even in a bigger font, even with great lighting, I gave up after about 30 minutes and moved on.  Reading the reviews I can see I am not the only one.  Some didn't even bother with it in hardcopy.  This isn't a great novel.  It is a collection of short stories about sad people.
B0049A9BSY|3.0|The fashion doesn't entirely disappoint in the second movie of Sex and the City but the characters seemed anything but themselves. As a long time Carrie Bradshaw fan, I found her to be very demanding, a diva, bitchy, and frankly a little annoying at times. Since she is an older Carrie in this film, I though that she might \\"grow up\\" a little more than when she was single with the fact that she is married to Mr. Big. She said to Mr Big in one scene, \\"Is it because I'm a nagging wife?\\" As the fan, you want to nod your head yes as soon as she says this. Samantha's make-up made her look about 5x older than she actually was. Charlotte was ok but seemed to be more of an airhead with Miranda lacking the spunk she had in the series (even in the first movie). It was nice to see Carrie's old apartment and that she still used it for writing purposes along with her closet still full of couture clothing. I adored the show and even the first movie that came out in which made me cry in the theater. I am glad I waited to get this special edition DVD for Christmas rather than go to the movies to see it and be disappointed.
0393072231|5.0|Dr. Larry Bates said this better than anyone could before it happened in his book 'The Coming Economic Disorder' . Michael Lewis said it better than anyone afterwards in this book,'The Big Short'.  This book plays out like a movie,better than ' Wall Street II ' by miles. It's very insightful to those who have never heard of a CDO or a Credit Default Swap. It's true that OPM(Other People's Money'  creates a moral hazard,it's also true that the insiders transferred 30 + years of retirements into the banks so that Obama (with the help of G.W. Bush) could transform this country into a Socialist regime. This was done  through nationalizing banks ,while being mislead by a malevolent dictator who pretended  he would follow an oath he took to defend our Constitution. It's about systemically killing our dollar and moving us into a New Global Order. They have stolen our childrens future and the American dream. This book shows us how this was done to us ,done with the  nut's and bolt's facts ,with real names, and real \\"traitors\\" selling us the rope with which we hung ourselves with.

030746363X|5.0|This book is a list of the most helpful stories I've ever heard (stories about how to gain A LOT of muscle, how to loose A LOT of weight, how to double the testosterone levels, etc). Every single story in this book, when applied, is worth much more than those 15 bucks or so. I could write a long post about how amazing this book is and why it is so amazing. But seriously, just see it yourself. Recommended for every single person on this planet
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The original theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven is without a doubt one of my favorite all-time movies. It's got a terrific leading performance by Orlando Bloom ( so far his best role), beautiful locations in and around Jerusalem and a non-stop feeling of wonder and adventure! While this director's cut doesn't drastically change any of the strengths of the original release it does have a lot more exposition and sheds some more light on the story and characters of the film.<br /><br />As I said the story of Kingdom of Heaven remains very strong and entertaining: after a visit form his father, a young blacksmith named Balin follows the crusader to Jerusalem and is witness to actions taken by christian templars and muslims. While I'm sure this film is far from historically accurate but it does make you think an is much deeper than director Ridley Scott's previous film 'Gladiator'. There's violence aplenty but characters drive this story just as much as large-scale sction scenes.<br /><br />Every actor is well cast in Kingdom of Heaven: Orlando Bloom is excellent in a quitely intense performance and comes off more as a reflective hero than most action fans are used to. Eva Green is well cast as the beautiful Sibylla and this extended cut gives her character even more depth. The rest of the cast including Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, Marton Csokas, Liam Neeson, and Alexander Siddig is just as strong and impactful.<br /><br />Most people will probably prefer this extended release of Kingdom of Heaven as it fills in some character motivations and fills the plot with more exposition and I liked watching it a lot, but I still wouldn't say it's BETTER than the original release. Being a long-time movie fan I was able to use my imagination and enjoy it's original presentation in theaters but if you felt perhaps the original film was missing something than this director's cut will probably satisfy.
B002JH3TW8|1.0|Connected my new iMac G5 running Snow Leapord to an older LaCie DVD drive.  It powers the drive, but will not stay powered.  The drive freezes and the only remedy is to restart.
B0048KXRR6|3.0|Unlike the first film, the one in my opinion is more strongly targeted to children only. The amount of \\"magic\\" and such just more strongly exaggerated in this one. All though very cute, I personally would have enjoyed the movie more without the piglet swimming part, and the flying motorcycle, but perhaps that is just me. I would definitely say it is a nice way to spend a few hours on a rainy afternoon with kids, but not a movie I would suggest to adults to watch solo.
B002T9H2ME|1.0|I love science fiction movies. My favourites are blade runner, alien and space odysee. But this, this is an abomination. OK, here is a sample of the idiocy: The initial sequence tells us that in the future the entire energy supply for planet earth will come from the moon. Hence, they bullt a massive site on the moon and send ... ONE man to harvest the precious resource. And it goes on. The protagonist can only communicate with his wife via PRE-RECORDED video messages, unlike the American astronauts in 1969, who sent their feeds back to earth LIVE. Oh, and he has a robot friend who makes a commodore 64 look futuristic. Apart from this idiotic set up the movie itself is absolutely painful. The pace is agonizingly slow, the acting by Sam Rockwell is horrible and the dialogues are boring as hell. The plot \\"twist\\" is super predictable and lame. To call this \\"the best sci-fi movie since blade runner\\" (quote on the poster) is an absolute travesty! The whole production team should be banned from ever making a movie again or worse, sentenced to watch their own work on auto-repeat.

B001UV4XFQ|1.0|These cheap greedy individuals that make a blu ray movie in unison with the regular dvd. I knew it was to good to be true to see a blu ray combo from them. Part 1 and part 2 were cheap on making a blu ray combo. This movie is not worth 17.00 in which i paid. 9.49 and thats it. Not to mention, this movie was sort of boring. The actors need to attend acting school to better there skills. They suck!

B003L77GRO|4.0|I'm gonna give it 4 stars, though in relation to other Dexter seasons I'd understand 3.  Dexter is always a fun and watchable show even when it doesn't attain to heights past, and this season is no exception.  While seasons 2 and 3 were highlights for me I stopped taking it too seriously by season 4 and continued to watch season 5 with the same appreciative attitude that I'd read a comic book with.  I enjoy it but I don't expect John Grisham.  So before mentioning its flaws let me just say that I did enjoy the season overall.  Season 5 however doesn't start with or go out with the bang of previous seasons.      With the cataclysmic ending of Season 4 I think most were expecting more of a riveting follow-up though I honestly I don't know exactly what more there was to follow up - and the season starts off with a pretty ho-hum initial episode where there's an overlong by-the-numbers mourning period that takes up pretty much the whole episode.  The 10 episodes between that and the last one however build up a fairly decent storyline with Jordan Chase, the psycho self-helf guru from hell.  As long as you expect the unprobable as probable you'll have fun watching he and Dexter's cat and mouse game.      The introduction of Lumen as Dexter's new love made a certain amount of sense, though at the same time I understand reviewers that found her character kind of annoying, as I did also.  But worse than her character as a character, was her romantic relationship with Dexter.  For all they go through together, their love for each other never really comes off.  So much so that by the last episode, her fate (at the writer's hands) certainly comes as no surprise.  Final scenes between her and Dexter were somewhat chuckle-able. Needless to say the first and last episodes in this season are not its high point, though I did think the very last scene itself came off well.  Also worth mention is the former detective that Quinn hires to scope out Dexter.  He was a pretty tough and believably good semi-villain - more formidable on screen than Jordan Chase most of the time and added good subplot tension to the story.      Season 5 is certainly worth the watch if you enjoyed previous seasons (as if I needed to say that) and I'll be catching season 6 when that comes out without a doubt.  It'll be interesting to see where the writers decide to go with the show after this as there really isn't much of a hook leading into the next season short of Deb and Quinn's near-confirmed suspicions about Dexter.  Some good \\"could be\\" double-meaning word play by Deb in the last episode. And Quinn certainly knows who saved his @ss, as does Dexter.  That may or may not provide fodder for season 6 and it will be interesting to see how or if this is going to make the show any more intriguing.
0199535639|3.0|I have not read the book yet but just recently purchased it and the print is SO tiny!! I will need a magnifying glass just to read it. I own a lot of books and none of them have print this small. Very disappointing.
B001USHRCK|3.0|We really love this set when it is all assembled. The problem is getting it assembled. We also bought the [[ASIN:B003F7YHXQ LEGO® Kingdoms King's Castle 7946]] and assembled it first. What made the castle so much easier is how it is packaged. The set is broken down into smaller sets in numbered bags. So when we started, all we had to do was get bag #1 and instruction booklet #1 and off we go. There were about 8 smaller sets like this and then we just hooked them together to complete the castle.     When we opened the [[ASIN:B001USHRCK LEGO® Castle Medieval Market Village (10193)]], there were still seperate instrcution booklets, but all 1600+ pieces were just packaged and not seperated like the castle. It took FOREVER with 2 kids and 7 adults to get this one together. The set is GREAT and we have an amazing Lego world in the living room, it was just very annoying to have it done that way.    This is what we have now and the kids love it: [[ASIN:B001USHRCK LEGO® Castle Medieval Market Village (10193)]], [[ASIN:B003F7YHXQ LEGO® Kingdoms King's Castle 7946]], [[ASIN:B003F7TODY LEGO® Kingdoms Outpost Attack 7948]], [[ASIN:B003F82FB6 LEGO® Kingdoms Prison Tower Rescue 7947]], [[ASIN:B003FOC7U4 LEGO® Kingdoms Prison Carriage Rescue 7949]], [[ASIN:B003MA1EWS LEGO Kingdoms Knight's Showdown 7950]], [[ASIN:B003F7TODY LEGO® Kingdoms Outpost Attack 7948]].
B00000ING2|3.0|A decent holiday movie, something of a forgotten one. This film makes an honest effort to pay homage to stuff like \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Meet John Doe,\\" but the movie at times feels as though it is trying too hard to emulate these classics. As a result there tends to be too much emphasis on the style in which the movie is made, and less on the acutal plot and content. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a decent job with her fast talking dialogue. To summarize, it's not that bad, but it's also certainly no \\"Fargo\\"( which is excellent!) in terms of overall quality.
B001CZVVVO|5.0|Even though we do not have a HD TV, this CD looks much better than our DVD copy of the same. Very clear in video and audio.

B002VGFZII|5.0|I never saw the G.I.Joe cartoon. When I knew it was going to be a film I thought I would be a bad movie, but when I saw the trailer, wow, it seemed interesting.   The movie has no boring moment. If you like sci-fi movies, you'll love it.

I just wanted to say I found the book at the library with no problems if your that interested in it just get it there its not worth your money or time in truth . Publisher is obviously going after a younger audience with this. I just cannot believe this is the same author I started reading in 1991. What complete stars in my eyes I have faithfully followed this story through the years and its started to unravel for me  with the last two books but this was a new low for Diana Gabaldon.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|If you aren't familiar with Avatar, its time you were. It is hands down the best effects movie ever made, there isn't anything even close. When we saw it in the theater we felt that it was an experience comparable to the first time we saw &#34;Star Wars&#34; in 1977. &#34;Star Wars&#34; moved effects movies to a new level of experience, and Avatar has done the same thing 33 years later. The only other movies I would suggest that fit in the category are Jurassic Park, and much later the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Integrated computer animation had of course been done before, notably in Jumanhi, but I felt that Jurassic Park was the first movie in which it looked &#34;real&#34;. Lord of the Rings went a step further by mass producing the animated actors and put them in very close proximity to the live actors. Avatar's leap was to make an almost entirely animated film look real.<br /><br />This Blu-ray set is an outstanding viewing experience. The color and detail is a cut above even other Blu-ray movies we own. I feel that the sharpness of the Blu-ray was better than the theater, even the Imax viewing we attended. It doesn't have 3D, but I didn't really miss that aspect of the experience. I'm sure that someday we'll purchase 3D viewing equipment, but we're not doing so yet, and I'm happy to enjoy the movie in this form until the time we do.<br /><br />The extra scenes just add to the experience. They are mostly jungle scenes, often with animals that you did not see in the original theatrical release. The quality is up to the standards of the shots in the original release, so they are seamless and just add to the already immersive atmosphere of this film.<br /><br />The surround sound is encompassing without being overbearing ... perfect for home theater viewing.<br /><br />I know the movie's detractors whine about the story. I've never been able to figure out what their problem is. The story is involving and dramatic. Does it remind you of parts of other movies you've seen over the years? Sure, but so what? What movie doesn't? In every case it takes any similar plot well beyond what you may be reminded of, and most importantly, this plot is a good vehicle for the effects, which are the stand-out achievement of this film in the first place.<br /><br />Considering that as a fan of this movie you are going to watch this again and again, the Blu-ray set is an incredible entertainment bargain at this price. If by some chance you have not seen this movie yet, you're in for a real treat when you view this Blu-ray offering.<br /><br />EDIT: We now also have the 3D version of this movie, which we viewed with a Sony 3D Blu Ray and a LG passive 3D wide screen LCD. Four of us viewed it, and thought that it looked better than when we originally saw in in the theater in IMAX 3D. The image had both tremendous depth and external room penetration. The little floating animals?/plants? appeared to be halfway between me and the screen surface. Virtually the entire time it looked like we could step through the screen into that world. One of our friends expressed the opinion that he thought the colors were more rich than in the theater or on the previous 2D blu ray. It's a must have for anyone with 3D home theater.<br />Why no voting buttons?

B00428CPUY|5.0|I have kept up with each year's \\"Crossroads\\" programs put on by Eric Clapton and this year is no less grand than the previous years' concerts. I love that he has a wide range of artists--everyone from Eric himself to a lot of R&B groups, artists, and even Country artists like Vince Gill. It is a real treat to see these superstars exchanging ideas, blending their musical styles in a real fusion that actually WORKS. A great mix of artists, all of whom are showcased for their fantastic talents on the guitar (primarily). Be sure that you turn up the stereo while watching this--you'll get the real concert feel of those who were fortunate enough to actually be there. If you're a Clapton fan, or just a fan of great guitar pickers, you won't be sorry you bought this DVD!
B002ZG9800|5.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers that there is definitely a natural connection between Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor in this fascinating movie. Both my husband and I agree that the chemistry that they have together in this movie is very hot and believable as the characters of Steven Jay Russell and Phillip Morris. We also agreed that both Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor deserve to win some type of movie awards for their portrayals (Oscar contender?).This movie is so interesting that (in terms of the many successful cons Steven pulled off in the name of love)it can play with your mind to know that it is based on a true story.  The saying that sometimes truth is stranger than fiction does definitely apply to this one of a kind movie. Jim Carrey gives a strong performance as conman Steven Jay Rusell who has a realization that he is gay after a near fatal car accident. Steven happens to be a very highly intelligent man (online sources have his iq measured to be in the 160's) who used his gift towards situations that eventually caused  him to end up in his current situation. However, this movie is worth watching because it paints a humorous and detailed picture of many of the successful and elaborate cons that Steven pulled off for love (which shows Steven's humanity). Ewan McGregor plays Phillip Morris, a man that Steven falls deeply in love with when he meets him in prison. The attraction is mutual, and ends up serving as a backdrop towards explaining why Steven felt like concocting many of the successful schemes that were cleverly executed.  An online article from the guardian has Steven himself admitting that he alone is responsible for his current predicament, although he did this for love. However, watching this movie is very worth it  because it can serve as a cautionary tale towards many compassionate and understanding people of how even someone that is highly intelligent can be steered towards a life of crime. I say this only from a non-judgemental but informative angle of how important it is to refrain from judging someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes.rmative angle of how important it is to refrain from judging someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|It's a pleasure to find quite a fantastic deluxe set as this. Three discs of Avatar with three versions of the movie. The one in orginal release from December 2009, the special edition released on September 2010 and extended cut only for home viewing. That's more than 16 minutes since the original and 8 more than the Special Edition. The movie is on two discs with subtitles in spanish and french, and two audio tracks (one is a family oriented dub without the strong words). The only thing that I would like to have is a feature-long commentary by James Cameron.    The third disc is all extra features to explore the richness of the capting world created by Cameron and his team in such a delightfull movie.    The packaging is also great, presented as a boook and great quality photos.
B0041X90ZI|5.0|Granted, the \\"Whirld Tour 2010: Live in London\\" album is not the very best and slickest registration of the most impeccably performed concert ever. But bear in mind that:  - Transatlantic is not a full-time band, and that, prior to going onto this tour, these musicians hadn't played together on stage for eight years;  - this tour was not a one-year, 100-plus-dates tour that allowed them to really iron out all the wrinkles;  - this is the full registration of one actual concert, not a selection of songs cherry-picked from different shows, as many other live albums are;  - this is probably some of the most complex and musically demanding popular music performed in recent years.    If you take that into account, then this is truly an amazing album.

0060920084|2.0|I will admit that I could hardly finish this depressing rant.  I found no entertainment whatsoever in the snobbish criticism that the immature Bryson tried to pass off as humor.  I had  thoroughly enjoyed A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003) as well as Down Under (2000), and picked up The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America (1989) based upon those experiences. What a disappointment!  His objective of rediscovering his home country was completely overshadowed by his negativity and fast-food approach to 'experiencing' small towns in America.  Bryson demonstrates that if you focus upon the negatives, you will almost certainly miss the positives of any town, in any country.  As Americans who lived in Norway, Indonesia and Abu Dhabi, and traveled extensively in many other countries, my wife and I learned early that the investment in travel will be wasted if one doesn't take the time to discover and savor the positives while seeking to understand the negatives.  A travel book that finds the right balance, with both humor and insight, is worthwhile and entertaining.  This one did not, and is not.

B004E9CFZG|1.0|As a big fan of Mad Men and Breaking Bad, the two best shows on TV, I was excited to watch AMC's new The Walking Dead -- especially after hearing so many good things about it from friends who normally have good taste in entertainment. However, I found the show to be completely uninteresting, not scary, and poorly acted (I notice that \\"bad acting\\" is one of the Tag Suggestions below) with terrible dialogue. The Walking Dead is based on a comic book, and perhaps the adaptation was too true to the original: everything about the show seems two-dimensional, and I can imagine it working in a comic book, but it falls flat on the screen. The characters are introduced as archetypes (at best) and stereotypes (at worst) which is a necessary short cut of the comic-book genre, but is just lame on TV. And the direction is manipulative: by episode 2, I could tell that the \\"suspenseful setup\\" was going to end with a, \\"oh good, it wasn't a zombie, it was another member of the party sneaking up on her!\\" I purchased the whole season on Amazon On Demand, and by the end of the first episode, my wife and I were left wondering what the heck was supposed to be good or interesting about this acclaimed program. I said I'd give episode 2 ten minutes to provoke my interest, and I watched beyond the point of disinterest, for about half of the episode, and realized that I was just wasting my time. My wife had been insisting \\"it must get better!\\" but I remember hearing about people loving the show after the first episode, and it just did not appeal to us at all. I guess you can throw zombies in just about anything and a certain, surprisingly large segment of the population will like it. This wasn't for me.

B00364K6YW|5.0|This version of the famous novel by Jane Austen is one of the best--if not the best--. Missing it's other language options (spanish, etc.) for subtitles or sound.

B00129H7VS|5.0|First of all the quality of the blu-ray is amazing (as expected).    Next the actual material, and the film is without a doubt, some of the best I've seen.  Everything, from the acting, wardrobe, scenery, production, etc is absolutely top notch.    A must for any history buff.....but I think a must for everyone in general that would like to know more about the European campaign..specifically following easy company.    I love the mini interviews that they have with the real soldiers prior to each episode.  They are truly the spirit and the soul of this country.

B0043RSE2M|3.0|The movie is awesome- you can read lots of reviews of it.<br />However- I spent an extra $10 for a set that I thought was including a 3D blu Ray that I could watch like we've done with many others.<br />Be warned- this 3D requires a 3D TV-<br />With 4 disks- you'd think they could have included both types of 3D.<br />I'm debating sending it back and just getting the non 3D version.
0143058134|4.0|As there have been many reviews of the book and its story, per se, I will not review that but this particular audiobook version of story. The reader of the audiobook is quite good and very dramatic. There is never a dull moment. The reader captures very well the emotional nuances of all the characters, from the beast's feelings of loneliness, isolation, rejection and resulting bitterness and anger to the revulsion of those who meet him to the creator's fear of his own creation, thirst for revenege and eventual finding of permanent peace. All and all an excellent well told story that will never bore and keeps the reader enthralled through its approximately three hour length. Highly recommended.
B004132HZS|4.0|...Moriarty.<br />Specifically, the performance of the actor playing the character once we find out who he is. (I won't reveal the actor's name, as it is a nice surprise)<br /><br />His mannerisms during he and Holmes' first face-to-face encounter, were like that of a childish prankster, completely lacking any intimidating presence one would expect from the caliber of evil mastermind that Moriarty is. And his voice...I thought he was just being sarcastic but apparently his voice sounding like a blend of effeminate and bratty IS his normal voice! The portrayal lacked any amount of believability for me that THIS guy was capable of being in the same league as Holmes...in fact, I don't even buy into him being in same league as WATSON...the landlady, Mrs. Hudson, perhaps, but not Holmes or Watson. Even Mycroft had more presence than Moriarty!!!<br /><br />I can only hope the writers are giving us a red herring and the REAL Moriarty has yet to be shown. Once star deducted, because Moriarty is a key part of Sherlock lore (Granted he was actually only in 2 of the 60 Sherlock stories Arthur Conan Doyle wrote) and his protrayal should be held to the same standards as the main character.<br /><br />Other than being completely disappointed in the Moriarty portrayal, my only other complaint is that the price is a bit high for only 3 episodes. I paid just $25 more for the fifth Doctor Who series on DVD, and it has 13 episodes! The fact that you get the unaired pilot plus some very nice special extras does soften the blow a bit...but still, $40???<br /><br />All that aside, I felt this modern adaption was exceptional! 4 1/2 stars solid! (It's a shame Amazon doesn't let you do half stars)<br />I am a huge fan of the Sherlock films where Basil Rathbone played Holmes, and have been very picky when it came to accepting other actors in the role. Benedict Cumberbatch seems to embody EXACTLY who I imagined Holmes to be and be like, when I read the Doyle stories as a kid. The ease in which he spouts out deductions and explainations of his conclusions felt like he actually knew what he was talking about, versus just speaking lines.<br /><br />The portrayal of Watson was well acted and served as a nice \\"moral compass\\" for Holmes, as well as being of high intellegence and deduction ability. In the books, Watson was incredibly intelligent in his own right, not the bumbling tag-along he is often played as, so it was refreshing to see a portrayal where he is shown as being an exceptional detective himself, while still leaving him as the \\"abused dog\\" that Holmes often treats him like.<br /><br />The stories have an excellent pace, and flow nicely. I like to solve mysteries ahead of the main characters, and loved that not only was I unable to \\"solve\\" the mysteries before Holmes, a second viewing reveals that the answers are \\"hidden in plain site\\" all through the episodes, so they didn't cheat!<br /><br />I liked how they took elements of the original stories and logically modernized them. Scarfs over hunting cap, Blogs over journals, Holmes network containing homeless people over children. While I can not recall if they included his famous \\"Elementary, Watson\\" line, they did include (with minor alteration) his famous line \\"Come, the hunt is afoot.\\"<br /><br />Having been a Sherlock Holmes fan since a child of the 1970's, having read, re-read, re-re-read all the stories, seen every adaption of the character in film and on television (some multiple times), I am very much judgemental about new attempts with the character.<br />That said, I personally feel that this is a far superior adaption than the Downey Jr. film, and the best portrayal of Holmes that I have ever seen....ever.<br /><br />I feel that new fans and long-time fans alike will absolutely enjoy this first season of episodes.ations of his conclusions felt like he actually knew what he was talking about, versus just speaking lines.

B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is terrific. I found it to be exciting, thought provoking and something I actually had to pay attention to. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie I had to watch from beginning to end so I knew what was going on. So many films out today are predictable and boring.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I lost 10 lbs. on level 1 alone. I was seriously at my worst weight ever, 138 at 5 feet. Ridiculous. I lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks. I eat healthier too though but I'm so much stronger. I have muscles! I have 15 lbs. to go and just started level 2. Oh man, I couldn't even do the full 20 mins until 3 days in (but that's how it was for level 1 too, which is now a BREEZE -- I can even do 15 mins of pilates after that level). But level 2 is so much more intense. I can't even imagine level 3. Unlike other reviewers, I don't have a problem doing the same exercises because I like to master something before I move on. All in all, I find this workout amazing and Jillian Michaels motivating.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|Saw this when it was making the drive-in-movie rounds; thought I'd never see it again. What a happy reunion to snag and review this DVD! A treat for longtime Stones fans, and a glimpse back in time when the original Stones were dealing with a change in the band's lineup after the loss of Brian Jones. Enjoyed Mick Taylor's musicianship during his brief time with the band. Great lineup of songs, including a few of my favorites I don't hear often enough, such as \\"Dead Flowers\\" and \\"Sweet Virginia.\\" I am delighted to have this concert footage in my library!
B003Q6D25K|4.0|Paranormal Activity 2 is entertaining while it lasts, but it's not a masterpiece and not going to get as much hype as Paranormal Activity 1 now that the uniqueness of it all has worn off. In short, PA2 is just like PA1. If you saw it, (Which you should before moving on to this one), you'll know exactly what you're in for. It's more of the same, for the most part. It takes what worked about PA1 and used it again, with a couple more interesting twists, and scraps most of what didn't work (long scenes with little or no payoff.) It's slightly scarier than the first one...the bigger budget led to more bangs and things flying at the camera that will make you jump, but the psychological aspect of the first one isn't present as much as it was before. In this way, its scary while you're at the movie, but you shouldn't have issues sleeping. This movie's a worthy follow up to the first- it learned from its mistakes from the first film, and its a pretty good horror flick. An added bonus if more look into the series mythology and more clarification about WHY the events of the first film happened. I won't spoil it, it's pretty good though. Fans of the first will be delighted, but those that didn't like the first should skip it this time, because there isn't enough to make it that different. All in all, I can't wait for the recently announced Paranormal Activity 3 due out next October.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If anyone were to rate this book lower than a five star, they would be insain! This book is a really good one with a perfect mixture of everything. Usually the sequles to books aren`t as good as the original, but this book might even trump &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Saw this movie for the first time on DVD and was surprised how derivative it was. Story was comparable to \\"Dances with Wolves\\" - in outer space instead of \\"Old West.\\" C'mon, natives who don't speak English, ride around on horse-like creatures, use bow and arrows for weapons and take to a man who betrays his comrades for good.<br />Blue creatures just happened to have two eyes, two hands and two feet. Puh-leeze, gimme something new. Spielberg already gave us realistic aliens without tails.<br />It was visually dazzling, but only because of special effects, not cinematography.<br />Final battle was \\"Apocalypse Now\\" on Pandora.<br />James Cameron shoulda sunk this project -- like the Titanic!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was AMAZING. The perfect mixture of romace, violence, tragety, and much more that is undiscibable. if you`re looking a good book, this is definetly where to look for one- where ever Suzanne Collins is is the right place to be.
B000058DFO|1.0|This review will only mean something to those of us who are familiar with the album and the song that really put Syreeta Wright on the map. You all know the one that I am speaking about dark green album cover, a full face of Syreeta on the album cover, her hair in beads and corn rolled, we all still have the album as I am looking at it as I type this review. Ok you got the Billie Preston duet but come on folks, get with the program get this album, get these downloads so I can get Blame it on the Sun and Let Me Be the One. You have this cover as a icon on one of the songs you have available for a download, but again I say please get the actual album, this one! Oh one more thing, it is the same album that has her version of Sign Sealed and Deliver.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Ordered Polar Express on December 20, 2010 not expecting it until after Christmas.  It arrived December 24, 2010 in protective packaging and in good condition.  Amazing turnaround. Kudos to Amazon for making online shopping a rewarding experience.
B004498KPU|4.0|I got this 2 days ago, and love it. I won't go on and on about his musical genius and visionary status, as we all very much know this. It's cool to see he's got more videos than I realized, even after I thought I saw every one on You Tube.<br /><br />I only give it 4 stars because it is incomplete - it does NOT contain all of his music videos. The two that are missing are \\"Captain EO\\" (my favorite of his videos, even above Thriller), and the \\"We are the World\\" video. I assume that has something to do with who's got the rights to those - Captain EO is Disney's domain, and We are the Worlds - not sure but it wasn't Michael Jackson alone who made it.<br /><br />The other reason I give it 4 stars is that it does not have subtitles. Wouldn't that be cool, to be able to see the lyrics via subtitles? I love Michael, but sometimes his lyrics are hard to understand!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm loving this regardless!
0385528752|5.0|No exaggeration, this is my favorite book of 2010.  I've recommended it to all my friends as well as my colleagues at work.  It provides the perfect framework for instituting a change, as well as a common language for brainstorming and discussing your plans with others.  Best of all, these tactics can be put to use in your business or in any aspect of your life that requires change.  Great book!
B000JQUKKU|4.0|A Christmas Carol remains a Christmas classic for good reason. As it asks us all to live with the spirit of Christmas everyday, it shows Scrooge learning how to be kind and generous and enjoy his family and the people around him. More than a Christmas story, it offers a moral vision of a kinder, more generous world.<br /><br />Charles Dickens' writing style remains accessible and often humerus. The spirit visitors are drawn so vividly, they are quite enjoyable to read about as well. It is worth reading the original, even though there are movie and abridged versions everywhere.<br /><br />While to its benefit, the Kindle edition is unabridged and free, it lacks illustrations. Most printed editions include enjoyable illustrations. This is probably its only defect.<br /><br />Enjoy! Trev from Trevsliteraryreview
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Having become a fan of Ken Follett after reading Pillars of the Earth, I was really excited when I heard he had another book, Fall of Giants, coming out.  While I balked initially at the e-book price (where's the discount?) along with the mixed reviews (who wants to invest in a 1000 pg bad read?) I soon succumbed and purchased it for my Kindle.      I could not put this book down.  It takes you through a journey during War World I from the perspectives of 5 very different families. It was pleasing to me to know that this was part of a trilogy of books, with the stories continuing hopefully for at least another 2,000 pages (1 book =1,000 pgs x 2). Probably not surprisingly, I am also a huge fan of long-running TV series where characters have the chance to become  fully developed as they do in Fall of Giants.    Overall, would highly recommend this book!
B004927I50|5.0|As usual Taylor has Always inspire me from her music. and every time Taylor make a new album more of her inspiring life is shown to us. the person who don't listen to Taylor Swift he's missing a lot great work.<br />as for the seller he's great he sent the package in the date he told me and it was in a great condition and brand you i strongly recommend buying from him.
B002VECM72|5.0|Though I have wide ranging interests in movies ranging from comedy to military, this movie has captured my interest and my heart completely.  Since the first time that I watched a rental copy I have been hooked.  Now, EVERY time I am channel surfing through HBO, etc on the TV and I find this movie playing (no matter how far into the movie it is at the time) I just CAN NOT push the FAVORITE button again.  I just HAVE to finish it off from where ever it is at the time.    Now I have purchased the Bluray version that came with the DVD and Digital copy and I couldn't be happier.  Never before in my 54 years has a movie so won me over.  I have now officially watched this film more than any other in my life, and that includes the Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life.    As you can tell, I heartily recommend this film to anyone of any age.  You will not be disappointed.
B00459EZSU|5.0|With SG-1 and SG Atlantis seasons over we can't wait for the next release of each SGU Season 2 episode. The characters are not my favorite but the story keeps us coming back for more as the crew discovers Destiny's secrets. One of our favorite shows.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I bought this to replace my old Garmin Forerunner 305. I thought it would be a lot better, but it is actually mainly worse. First, it does not do multi-sport like the 305 can. What this means is that you will not have accurate data for a triathlon. The watch will always think you are running. The 305 can be set on \\"bicycle\\" or \\"other.\\" Not a deal-breaker ... yet.    Second, it is not waterproof, but neither are any of the Garmin's except the Forerunner 310XT, which is probably the next one I will get. They are all considered water-resistant, but not recommended for swimming ... Still not a deal-breaker.    One of the advantages of this watch was it's small size (better for a woman's wrist) and it's functionality as a sport watch when not being used as a GPS. Unfortunately, this multi-functionality makes it difficult to use. Just when you are ready to use the GPS, it will automatically switch back to \\"watch\\" mode. This is not really a problem once you have figured out how to use it correctly, but I read the instructions, then took it out for a run only to find I couldn't figure out how to get it back to the GPS mode. Very frustrating.    Finally, there is the touch bezel feature. Great idea, but not well executed. The buttons are very finicky and often don't work as they should. When you are in the middle of a long run, the last thing you want to be doing is fighting with your watch to get it into the mode you want. Just the last straw in this sub-par edition of the Forerunner. I returned it and got a replacement of my Forerunner 305 for $79 directly from Garmin. When I upgrade next time, I will buy the waterproof 310XT, which also has the multi-sport feature.    The reason I purchased this model in first place was for its charging cradle (one of the things that went bad in my 305) and for its ability to remotely sync with your computer. Both of these things do seem to work better than the 305.
B0045ODPKY|4.0|I love Angelina, but I regret to share that I experienced the movie as satisfactory.  When I purchase DVDs, I usually watch the product twice, but this time once was more than adequate.  The action was good and the storyline interesting, but it just missed its mark.  If I read this review, I would want specifics, but I find it difficult to put my arms around my reservations.  I find it difficult to articulate my reservations to recommend this movie.<br /><br />My truth:  the movie was satisfactory, like salted eggs but missing the crisp bacon.  Anyway, I have the film in my library and I will treasure it.<br /><br />I hope this helps.  Cheers!
B000066NW0|5.0|I received Let Go almost 8 years ago to the day, as a Christmas gift. Back then, I was a shy, insecure fifth-grader, and Avril's message about being proud of who you are really hit home for me. I listened to this album almost every day from late 2002 to 2005, and it quickly became the soundtrack of my life. Avril was the first pop singer I became interested in, and she helped me have confidence in myself.<br /><br />Enough of the trip down memory lane. :) I have always liked Avril's voice; though it's not absolutely perfect, it has a certain quality that grabs me. Let Go's lyrics are relatable to anyone who is or was a teenager, especially on songs like \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say.\\" Avril really shows off her range here: there are tracks with an angry, rockish feel (\\"Unwanted,\\" \\"Losing Grip\\") and slower, ballad-type songs (\\"Tomorrow,\\" \\"Too Much To Ask\\"). I believe that there's something for everyone.<br /><br />My advice is to forget about all the negativity towards Avril and just listen to her music. In my opinion, it's very good and not at all \\"just for kids.\\" I used to visit one of her fan forums, and the community was made up of everyone from preteens to people over 50. I've listened to this CD for 8 years and I'm still not tired of it. To put it simply, I highly recommend Let Go.<br /><br />P.S. A special sidenote to Avril, wherever she is: Thank you so much. This album changed my life. &lt;3

B002JVWQSW|5.0|Outstanding acting, brilliantly crafted characters, and writing loaded with wit and wisdom all come together to make for one of the most hilarious shows on television in years. The Pritchett, at once loving and dysfunctional, is a family you'll want to be a part of and an ensemble cast you cannot miss. Patriarch Jay and his new, much younger and beautiful wife Gloria; his daughter Claire Dunphy and husband Phil, who have three children; his gay son Mitchell and love Cameron and their adopted daughter Lily--A unique family that faces everyday problems. Ty Burrel as Phil is wonderful as a man with a big heart and a smaller brain, and a deluded self-image that makes him think he's much cooler than he actually his. Eric Stonestreet steals almost every scene he's in as the bombastic but caring Cameron. Ultimately I find the show spilling over with laughs.  It is extraordinarily funny and often beautifully poignant.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|They're easy to to hook up to the PS3. They are the best headset I've used. They come with very easy to read instructions.. other headsets for gaming don't. They are easy to break though at the earphone. I broke mine and just super glued it back together.. It works fine.. that's the weakness of all headsets these days. Plastic breaks. Other than that.. I highly recomend them to anyone thinking of buying a pair for their gameplay.
B003O86FMW|5.0|THis is the best book that I have ever read other than her first book. This book is combines modern lifestyles with that of a controling power above Catnesses control yet somehow she finds the streath to outsmart the Presedent. If you have not read it it is worth WHATEVER you will pay for it. TRust me you will read it again and again.
1401207529|4.0|It is hard to compare Frank Miller's books, but Year One is definitely more accessible perhaps traditional batman story than his legendary Dark Knight stories.  David Mazzuchelli is also talented in his own right (see Asterios Polyp).    Year One has been cited as one of the main influences for Christopher Nolans Batman films.  If you enjoyed Nolan's more realistic Gotham city, dominated by gangsters who attempt to use Batman's colorful rogues gallery to distract him from the root of the city's corruption, that comes straight out of the pages of Year One (as well as its \\"sequel\\" The Long Halloween).    I'm somewhat biased as a big Frank Miller fan, but I would highly recommend this graphic novel for any Batman fan.
B002P3J3BW|5.0|Many consider Vladimir Horowitz the greatest pianist that ever lived.  This set includes recordings covering the majority of his career and repertory and is an excellent value.<br /><br />If, however, you aren't quite prepared to start with a 70 CD set, or if you already have this set and are looking for the recordings not included in it, you may want to take a look at the Horowitz [[ASIN:B0041O9AW0 Complete Recordings on Deutsche Grammophon]].  Since this large set does not include any of the Deutche Grammophon recordings, you can also safely get both sets.
0446563048|5.0|I loved it! Tony Hsieh has written the best book yet for entrepreneurs wanting to disrupt the status quo. Hsieh, in his highly acclaimed best seller \\"Delivering Happiness\\" humbly describes the true, unvarnished start-up experience - the ups and downs, the twists and turns, the wins and the losses, and the sacrifices - and the personal transformation that came with it.<br /><br />While he tells his story that led the successful creation of Zappos, the book is not an autobiography nor is it comprehensive story of the company's creation. Rather, \\"Delivering Happiness\\" highlights Hsieh's \\"learnings\\" that led him towards discovering personal happiness in business and in life.<br /><br />Hsieh began his entrepreneurial journey with the creation of LinkExchange which was acquired by Oracle and made him a millionaire early in life. He then became an investor in a number of ventures which included an online shoe retailer which would become Zappos. With most of his investments going south, Hsieh took the reins of the shaky shoe retailer to salvage what he could. The eventual multi-billion dollar sale of Zappos to Amazon in which the company's identity would remain intact with Hsieh still in charge serves a testament to what Hsieh accomplished and what he believes about success... \\"we are brainwashed by society; stop chasing money, start chasing passion.\\"<br /><br />Some particularly noteworthy stories and \\"learnings\\" that would benefit all entrepreneurs include:<br />* Concentrate your position.<br />* Managing through the bleak periods.<br />* The iterative nature of a start-up (no plan can script where you will be in two years).<br />* Dealing with the unforeseen events (a companion for all start-ups) - \\"Gotta do what you have to do.\\"<br />* Keeping a positive outer appearance while enduring the \\"most stressful times in my life.\\"<br />* It's a race against time.<br />* Taking the risk of being completely broke.<br />* Never outsource your core capability.<br />* Treating vendors as partners.<br />* Transitioning from the worry of survival to the challenge of building for the long term.<br />* The importance of alignment with board of directors and the top ten questions when seeking board members.<br /><br />Hsieh's pivotal turning point in life while he was still contemplating what to do with his life after LinkExchange came when he attended a RAVE in a warehouse covering ten football fields.

B002GJT4YQ|4.0|I bought all 4 of the Ultimate Edition Blue-rays and they all came with an authorization code and \\"Warner\\" URL to download a digital copy except this one. I wrote to both Amazon and Warner Bros thinking it might have been an oversight, but received no assistance from either. Warner Bros even went so far as to say it was Amazon's issue because \\"Digital Copy\\" was not printed on the outside of the box. I sent them copies of all 4 movies to show that it was not printed on any of them but was included in the description. What sense does it make to have it for movies #1, #3, and #4 but not #2? You would think after spending almost $100 someone would believe in customer satisfaction.
B002ZG99NG|1.0|I'm sure this is a fine film, but beware that the \\"combo\\" package only provides the \\"extended cut\\" on blu-ray, not dvd.  This is not at all clear from either packaging or the listing on Amazon.  Aggravates me as I don't have blu-ray, so I wasted my money on this version.

0743298039|4.0|***1/2    The Thirteenth Tale stars a withdrawn young bookseller named Margaret, whose defining passion is Victorian-era novels. She receives an unexpected invitation from Vida Winters, an extremely popular but reclusive novelist, to hear and chronicle the author's biography, which has never been made known to anyone else. Of course, Miss Winters has some secrets...    The Thirteen Tales resembles a (mildly) darker version of those same Victorian novels, written in a similar style, peopled with eccentric characters from a secluded English estate, and full of gothic twists and turns. I can't say that this novel, in sum, really captivated me, but it is skillfully plotted, each character and event part of an elaborate jigsaw that comes neatly together in the final pages. You may find yourself doing some rereading after a certain key twist casts a new light on preceding events. The characters are well-drawn, if a little anachronistic (then again, no identifiable year, or even decade, is attached to any occurrence), and the story didn't outstay my willingness to be involved in an homage to a genre that's not my usual cup of tea.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I don't necessarily dislike the overall story. I don't like how Eddard is supposed to be this great lord of the North. He is so great that the King wants him to be his right hand man. How does a \\"Lord\\" of a realm get to that lofty position, but is stupidly betrayed by an obvious snake in the grass? I saw his demise coming a mile away. I almost stopped reading the book when his demise unfolded in such a basic juvenile fashion. I mean seriously, you know there is no love lost between the two families, you know that there are plots for the throne, you know that the King's supposed heir is a despicable human being, you then find out that the heir really isn't an heir because he is an inbred bastard of the Queen's and her distrustful dishonoroable brother, and then when the king dies you ignore all help to move on the queen ( even after she warns you to your face that she will kill you if you lose), and you let the inbred son kill you. I was so mad that I read this far hoping that the author would twist away from the direction I saw it going, but he didn't. This whole plot line was a disappointing joke. Furthermore, there is so much detail spent with certain situations that don't seem relevant, while situations that seem like they would have more bearing on the story are glossed over.  The only character that actually rang true was the imp. At least he said what was on his mind when all of the other idiots in the story were whining or blundering around like buffoons.<br />I'm not sure, but I highly doubt, if I'll move forward in this series.  Especially now that I hear the series doesn't really end.  Buyer beware, the plot line of Lord Eddard's demise is so blatantly predictable, you will start getting mad about a quarter of the way in because even a novice politician can see what is about to happen.
0345457692|4.0|***1/2    Altered Carbon doesn't break any new ground in genre (gritty detective novel) or setting (gritty William Gibson/Blade Runner-esque future), but it's an entertaining read, and Morgan uses the more speculative aspects of his world -- particularly the whole idea of being able to upload one's consciousness to new bodies -- to add interesting twists to what otherwise might be a familiar plot. It's smart without being overly cerebral. If you're looking for solid, straight-ahead 2000s sci-fi, this is a good book to check out.
B001FB55H6|4.0|The most accurate film adaptation of a comic book or graphic novel that I have ever seen.  Very violent, not suitable for children and liberals.  This is the director's cut, there is also the extremely masochistic super director's cut with Tales of the Black Freighter interwoven in the movie, as well as the theatrical release; all are good but I prefer this director's cut, as it has more Hollis Mason, but no additional Dan's ass.
159448385X|5.0|****1/2  Well-deserving of its success. The plot and characters have a storybook-like simplicity, but that doesn't detract from Hosseini's rich window into Afghan life, or the genuine sense of mingled heartbreak, beauty, unfairness, compassion, horror, and hope that he conveys. The story focuses on two women from very different backgrounds, one poor and one well-educated, who are thrust together in the same household by terrible circumstances. They begin their imprisonment together, under a tyrant of a man, as enemies, but over time, their relationship begins to change....  To me, A Thousand Splendid Suns was a good old-fashioned page-turner. I love portrayals of countries very different from my own, and Hosseini brings his land of origin to life, over several decades. He may not be the most complex author, but I enjoyed the simple, unassuming honesty of his writing. Even if he writes some crowd-pleasing turns in the plot, the moments of joy feel earned through the suffering and abuse experienced by his protagonists. Even the villains in the story receive some sympathy, a reflection on the way of harsh circumstances at driving people to be something worse -- or better -- than what they might have been otherwise.  I can't compare this book to the Kite Runner, which I haven't read, but I think it stands wonderfully on its own. Yes, it's a novel aimed at \\"mainstream\\" readers, but as mainstream goes, it's a very good one.

0143034901|4.0|***1/2<br /><br />I always feel like the jerk at the party when I give a so-so review to a book that many other people obviously love. I enjoyed the gothic atmosphere and the author's arm-whirling description of Barcelona, a decade after the Spanish Civil War. Some of the characters were great, such as the affable tramp, Fermin, and the menacing inspector. The consciously literary air was appealing, too; in some respects, the proceedings feel like an old library come to life, with half-familiar characters and scenes whirling off the shelves.<br /><br />Yet, I found the book overly melodramatic, and the plot a little banal. It wasn't hard to anticipate where each new twist in the story was headed, or how the protagonist would deal with it.<br /><br />Overall, not a disappointing read, but, for me, it fell short of the glowing reviews.

0765348276|4.0|Conventional but entertaining military sci-fi in Heinlein's tradition. Scalzi doesn't add anything particularly fresh or deep to the genre, but he does know how to give readers a good, old-fashioned page turner. His concept of turning senior citizens into genetically-rebuilt soldiers, now that their lives are \\"over\\" and they can face near-certain death without regret, and sending them to fight on the front lines against many ruthless and competitive alien species is interesting, though these distinctions from other space adventures get blurred as the story moves forward.    All in all, an escapist Starship Troopers for the 2000s, with genetic modifications and nanotechnology instead of mechanized suits, and soldiers who have doubts about who they are and what they do, even as circumstances force them to do it. Some clunky dialogue and a patent lack of realism at times, but otherwise a fun lazy afternoon read.    (On a side note, if you're interested in writing and/or sci-fi books, Scalzi has an excellent blog.)
006112429X|2.0|I don't understand why so many people think this book is well written. I found Shriver's writing style to be convoluted and ultimately quite irritating. Too many commas for my liking! I'm half joking about the commas, but consider this sentence: \\"Kevin himself has been surprised by my dogged appearances, which is not to say, in the beginning at least, pleased.\\" Or this one: \\"After five minutes, I might ask him, my voice hoarse, about the food.\\" Maybe I'm not seeing the forest for the trees, but the way this book was written annoyed me.    I also had a major problem with the fact that the book is written as a series of letters to the protagonist's ex-husband. There's way too much information in the book for this to be a credible way of telling the story. I simply didn't believe that she would write all that to her ex-husband, especially all the background of their previous lives together which he would already know! It's an interesting way of telling a story, but it would only work if the book was much shorter and the reader had to piece together some of the story for themselves. Sure there could be a \\"remember when...\\" here and there, but this book has so many long passages explaining things that the ex-husband would surely already be aware of, and this just draws attention to the fact that the story is being forced into a format that doesn't really suit it.    I was looking forward to reading this book, but unfortunately I didn't find it very engaging.
0307387178|4.0|Via the story of Chris McCandless, a young man from a middle class background who decided to turn his back on civilization and retreat into the Alaska wilderness, where he met his death, Krakauer explores the forces that drive people to do such things. Is it arrogance, discontent, a desire to prove oneself against nature? Or are they following some deeper calling? Since the author could only learn so much of Chris McCandless and his last days, this question is ultimately left to the reader, but the story is a haunting and compelling one. In gathering insight into what may have shaped Chris, Krakauer considers other adventurers and nonconformists who have sought similar lone communion with the wilderness, including himself. It reveals a fascinating streak within the American character.    A great read for anyone who's ever thought about what it would be like to truly leave it all behind.
0553328255|5.0|A while ago I was in England for a professional Conference, and was able to find time to make a day trip to London. On this occasion I took the opportunity to visit the Sherlock Holmes \\"House\\" and Museum on 221-B Baker Street, directly across from Regent's Park. It is a charming place, well worth the time to any admirer of the great detective. In particular, there were sprinkled throughout the walls and furniture of the Museum's cramped rooms, many written allusions and souvenirs which referred to various characters and plots associated with Sir Authur Conan Doyle's supreme literary creation. Although I had read his Sherlock Holmes stories as a youngster, I had apparently retained shockingly little of this material, as said Museum references triggered only a fraction of my memory. But my shameful ignorance at least provided me an excuse to reread \\"The Complete Sherlock Holmes\\", in volumes I and II. The (standard) edition I used is older  - 1960 from Doubleday & Company  - but of course, these two volumes have surely never been out of print, at least in paperback form.<br /><br /> It is almost universally acknowledged, I should think, that Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes body of work makes for fantastic reading. I will try here to provide a brief justification as to why.<br /><br /> My particular edition contains a forward by Christopher Morley. In a way, the first words of his foreword are the most relevant: \\"It was unfair of Conan Doyle to say...that Dr. Watson had never shown a gleam of humor nor made a single joke.\\" This is quite the understatement; inasmuch as Dr. Watson is essentially his alter ego, Conan Doyle with his remark was clearly engaging in self-deprecation. But in fact, within Dr. Watson's highly polished and coherent narratives, a strong strain of understated hilarity is often present in Conan Doyle's stories. It is this light comic touch which, blended with Dr. Watson's manifest sense of decency, makes Conan Doyle's stories so comforting and enjoyable to the reader. If asked to list some clever and witty novelists of the Regency or Victorian era, one might rattle off the names of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and William Thackeray; Sir Authur Conan Doyle would probably not come immediately to her or his mind. But nothwithstanding the often serious nature of Sherlock Holmes' detective and crime fighting work, Conan Doyle's masterful sense of the ridiculous flares up again and again in his stories.<br /><br /> For example, in the short story \\"A Case of Identity\\", Sherlock Holmes ventures the opinion that everyday real life is much more capable than fiction of producing \\"fascinating\\" or \\"artistic\\" events. Dr. Watson is unconvinced: \\"Let us put your [thinking] to a practical test (says Dr. Watson). Here is the first heading [of the newspaper] upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife'. There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\\"<br /><br /> Dr. Watson is mistaken: \\"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument\\", says Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \\"This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller\\".<br /><br />  As another example, consider \\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\\", in which Dr. Watson's mentions the eternal sufferings of Mrs. Hudson, the wellknown landlady of Sherlock Holmes: \\"...Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in London\\".<br /><br />The novels and short stories contained in these volumes are replete with such charming dialogue and observations of the ridiculous. Of course, the old Sherlock Holmes television series, with the incomparable Jeremy Brett, are very faithful to the substance, dialogue and plot of Conan Doyle's stories, and are moreover a true joy to watch (especially, uncut as they are on DVD); but to gain a true appreciation of the richness and breadth of Conan Doyle's biting wit and literary cleverness, these stories must absolutely be read directly. Given the current drift of popular cinema and reality television - which is, to put it mildly, a tendency to rather visceral plot lines (when there are plot lines) - the effect of Conan Doyle's beautifully wrought stories upon the modern reader is arguably much more powerful today, than when they initially appeared in the late Victorian World.characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity which must have sorely tried her patience.

B00006CXXU|4.0|Bottom-Line: \\"Stripped\\" is proof that a sophomore album does not have to, well, suck, given the proper direction and creative input.<br /><br />The modern Pop/Rock American music scene has long been (almost) bereft of a true female vocal talent, what with Mariah's voice on the wane and Whitney Houston continuing her climb out of the drug-lined hole she jumped into with Bobby Brown.  That leaves the field to three true female vocalists with the ability to combine true talent with soulfulness: Kelly Clarkson, Joss Stone, and Christina Aguilera; all others need not apply.  Joss hit us with two stellar CD's: 2003's The Soul Sessions, and 2004's Mind, Body & Soul, and Christina Aguilera bequeathed us her 2002 masterwork \\"Stripped.\\"<br /><br />Yes, Christina Aguilera is back, and in a big way with her second (English language) studio release; the very ambitious, 20 track, musical feast called \\"Stripped.\\" The first single from the CD, Dirrty (track No.16) seemed to earned her instant accolades and derision for its audacious music video that saw Christian wearing very little and acting decidedly unfeminine.<br /><br />No matter, the song would go on to be one of the anthems from an album that included a wealth of inspiring tracks, most noteworthy, track No.11 Beautiful, which was, and is, embraced by every group, or individual who had, or has  been told they were anything but attractive and or worthy.  With this one beautifully rendered song, Ms. Aguilera won legions of fans who embraced her \\"just like you\\" persona.<br /><br />\\"Stripped,\\" which sold 330,000 copies in its first week of release, would go on to peak at No.2 on the Billboard 200. And unlike that which went before, Christina took creative control of the CD, and indeed co-wrote almost every track on album and-in-so-doing infused with it with her unique and oftentimes overly sexualized personality.  \\"Stripped\\" is personal for Ms. Aguilera you can hear it from the opening number Stripped Intro in which she states that she has waited a long time to release the album, and that she wants to introduce herself, the \\"real me, no gloss, no pretense, just me, Stripped.\\"<br />After the release of Stripped, Christina played up the album's rather reveling cover, taking park part in photo-shoots for magazines, in which she appeared nude or semi-nude. Her much talked about cover for Rolling Stone, featured Aguilera wearing only boots and a well-placed electric guitar. It was during this period that Ms. Aguilera referred to herself as \\"Xtina\\", even getting a tattoo of her nickname on the back of her neck and started sporting several piercings.<br /><br />And then the lithe beautiful, sexy Ms. Aguilera proceeds to sing and emote like only she can.  She holds nothing back belting out one song after another with that now powerful, yet angelic voice, because underneath all of Christine Aguilera's coy affectations, outlandish clothing, less than subtle come-on's, overt sexuality, and vocal gymnastics lies a rare and striking talent. On Stripped, Aguilera lets her mature voice out of the box, allows it to flower by abandoning all pretense at courting the Disney (pre-teen and teenage) market.  \\"Stripped\\" is an undeniable, headlong, unabashed, and effortless move into adulthood and all of its weightier trimmings.<br /><br />Using her astonishing voice as an emotive tool, Aguilera peals back the portions of her live heretofore only speculated at; her voice is a moving, at time equal parts grit and anger as she sings about betrayals, petty jealously(s) and about the disintegration of a relationship.  The message: she has overcome; yes there was pain, but she is ultimately stronger for it.  But, \\"Stripped\\" has another theme as well, personified on track No.2 Can't Hold Us Down (featuring Lil' Kim) and that is the power of women to overcome despite, well, men. And you have to love, track No.15 Get Mine, Get Yours, Christina's homage to the one night stand, heretofore the domain of men...<br /><br />Guest artists and or contributors on \\"Stripped\\" include the aforementioned Lil' Kim, Redman, singer/song writer, former 4 Non Blondes leader, and Pink collaborator, Linda Perry (wrote track No.11 Beautiful, and co-wrote four others), and Alicia Keys (wrote and was featured on track No.9 Impossible). Aguilera co-wrote most of the songs on the disc and produced one cut.<br /><br />One cannot listen to \\"Stripped\\" without it leaving with the impression that this is a really personal body of work for Christine, an aural coming out party, a musical masterwork that she poured her emotive self into.  The results for the listener--at least this listener--are impressive and altogether moving.<br /><br />All the elements to make this 20 track set a winner have come together--emotive lyrics, great instrumentation, serious sterling vocals, and stellar production and engineering--culminating in spectacular second coming of Ms. Aguilera.  There was not a track I did not enjoy on Stripped, well maybe with the exception of Dirrty, which was a little too hard edged from my tastes.<br /><br />\\"Stripped\\" is proof that a sophomore album does not have to, well, suck, given the proper direction and creative input.

B002ZG981E|1.0|Rewview is about blu-ray and features promised by WB and not about film. Film is good but studio WB sucks!    I purchased the Blu-ray/DVD. Inside the package there is a leaflet which gives redemption code to download the digital copy for your iphone/itouch device. It gives the steps to download the digital copy.  1. Go to [...]2. Follow the instruction to get your digital copy  3. When prompted, enter the autorization code.    When I go to the site, it says in simple 4 steps you can download your digital copy. But page only gives two steps for itunes. I tried this several times. Warner brother sucks! If you care to buy digital copy go and buy directly on itnues. Do not buy warner brother blu-ray/DVD package. Greatly disappointed with WB.

0061714372|5.0|There are few books that I cannot put down, or even skip a couple of boring pages/passages that I probably won't remember anyway. This is one of those! I read this book over a matter of 4 days that I had off of work. I was \\"addicted\\" for a lack of a better term to the way that Dave and the ghost writer speak to the reader as if it was a conversation over coffee. The last bio of a rocker that I read that was this good was Nikki Sixx's Heroin Dairies (and I had to put that one down a few times because it was just way too intense!    If you were a long term Megadeth fan you will remember much of the stories as I found myself thinking \\"I wonder if he'll mention what happened...oh wait here it is\\". I appreciated the openess of his feelings to topics such as his current state of religion, his womanizing (I never knew that and I've been a fan for almost 20 years), his early days of drug dealing, and the former band mates of Megadeth that helped with his drug dependency, but after awhile one will find themselve saying \\"Damn it! If he mentions how much he is pissed off at Metallica one more time!\\". I can get old, but you still read on because, well,..it's Dave and it's really interesting. Did I mention that he states he is rather pissed off at Metallica?    Highly (no pun intended) recommend this to any Megadeth fan! This is the nitty gritty of metal history.

B003WTE886|4.0|Taylor is growing up and her music is becoming more relatable for adults. I would say some of these songs are too mature for young girls (\\"she's better known for the things that she does on the mattress\\", etc.\\") My favorites are: Speak Now, Mean, Never Grow Up (which brought tears to my eyes thinking about my little girl), Better than Revenge, and Haunted. Some of them definately have more of a pop than country feel, but I enjoy a wide range of genres. Hope you enjoy!  PS: I found it impressive that she wrote all the songs solo.
B0013FBS20|5.0|Verdict:  Movie is really nice (simple story but cool). I prefer the alternate ending (much more realistic; I hate happy endings). CGI of the monster is too \\"smooth\\" but still believable enough.

B004ASNG04|5.0|There is a great deal to recommend this book.  An historical depth that I have rarely come across before (Guns, Germs, and Steel is another example).  A willingness, eagerness to treat Eurasia as a single geographical organism.  An attempt to develop an objective standard for measuring states and empires through social development.  Much else besides.  The last chapter falls apart, as futurism, generally does into bizarre, but unique, tropes drawn from Asimov and Kurzweil.  This last seemed to come out of nowhere and that's one of the weaknesses of the conclusion is that the reader was not given a background for this.  I've read both others and see much to recommend Asimov but feel Kurzweil, though demanding and compelling, is on the lunatic fringe of rational thought.<br /><br />Having said this I feel that Morris Theorem [That change is caused by lazy, greedy, frightened people (who rarely know what they are doing) looking for easier, more profitable and safer ways to do things] is interesting and as cynical as the rest of the book.  This is not a book where the individual [great or otherwise] has any real place.  All is groups and clinical abstractions which rule our lives ... not least of these is geography.  Since this last has re-appeared with Jared Diamond more and more has been ascribed to it.  And here's the problem with this brilliant book [no sarcasm intended].  Morris has given himself, and us, over to his algorithms.  The problem with such prognosticating is that you never ever have enough data to plug into the equation so that it returns a correct response.  Take the credit crunch....only one or two saw it coming and they were unknowns...for the most part.<br /><br />The business of prediction is only as good as your data.  Here the data is sparse and open to radically different interpretations.  Then there is that business o f us all becoming spiritual machines (Kurzweil).  What can I really say about that?  How do you either prove or disprove this?<br /><br />No, there are too many variables for to take seriously his vision of the future....but environmental extremists and futurists will love him to death.<br /><br />What is great about this book is the examination of Eurasia from about 9,600 BCE until approximate 2050 CE.  Well, up until 2010 or so is great...things go to hell after that point....but they're fun if muddled.<br /><br />If you are looking for an all-in-one book about Eurasia this is great.  However, India has no place in this narrative (though there are glancing references).  What is brilliant is how he redefines the West...not just Europe but he extends it all the way to Northern Iraq and Southern Iran (the hilly flanks of southwestern Asia....India I think).  From here he tracks the evolution of the West which finally encompasses Europe...its one time periphery.  The data on China's various dynasties and empires is very interesting.  Also why the West discovered the Americas and had an Industrial Revolution and East Asia did not.  There's a lot to find silly and more to open a dialogue with in this book but as a whole I would rate it one of my best non-fiction reads in many years.  Well worth the effort (long book but well written) and price of admission.  But do I believe it?  Some....but not the stuff post-2010...that is just too loopy for me.<br /><br />Highly recommended for history, economic, fringe thought buffs.e are too many variables for to take seriously his vision of the future....but environmental extremists and futurists will love him to death.

B001JNNDGA|4.0|Bluray is superb. Movie?  Language is in Aramaic and the way they speak it is not believable (it's like saying 1 word at a time and stopping for 2 seconds between each word). They should have practiced more to make the dialog flow smoother. The whole movie is about his last moments, so don't expect much on character development. But still worth watching (once; it's not something you can watch every week).

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Well what's there to say about this latest Alien box set that hasn't already been said. I got it shortly after I told myself I wasn't going to get it thanks to an Amazon one day sale that made it cheaper than what I had originally paid for [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)]] and it seemed quite worth it at that point.<br />I was a bit disappointed after my viewing of the second film, not with the film it's self but with the quality of the transfer. Aliens was really buggy and had lots of flicker and grain, I don't really mind the grain and I can't figure out if the flickering is a problem with my display set up or with the actual transfer I'm guessing it's the former since I haven't seen any other complaints about it but honestly I was expecting a little bit better treatment for arguably the biggest film in the franchise. The DVD version on the Quadrilogy set didn't have any of this flickering in the darker scenes and holds up just about as well under scrutiny. Like I said, I don't mind grain in a film that's better than 20 years old but I've yet to find a reason for this weird flickering it does. Since I'm more fond of the theatrical version of Aliens as opposed to the extended version I was thinking maybe they were lazy and just used an old transfer for the theatrical and remastered the extended for Blu-Ray but upon viewing that version all the same problems are present. I've adjusted every possible setting and I can't get rid of this flicker, it's not a huge deal it's just kinda distracting. James Cameron mentions in the commentary some technical aspects of the film stock used for this film that was far to technical and involved for me to understand without a degree from film school but what little I could glean from the director mentioned something to the fact that the film used was very prone to grain and other problems, so I think that explains away some of the problems with this transfer. There's only so much the remastering process can do, I guess.<br />The sound on this film has always been one of the standout parts of the movie and it gets a really nice treatment in the HD 5.1, there's lots of subtle sound effects that are mixed to perfection and simplified enough so that even if you don't have a big whopper of a sound system it still sounds great on your regular TV output. This is usually something I'm concerned with since I watch movies mostly late at night and don't wanna keep the neighbors up listening to Alien Queens screeching.<br />This is one of the all time great sci-fi films and it's James Cameron at his best, in my humble opinion I just wish Fox would have spent a little money restoring it for this particular release. I'd also like to mention that it has one of the most entertaining commentary tracks I've ever heard and if I'm not mistaken it won some kind of DVD award back in '03<br /><br />Ok the evaluation of the Aliens disc is over so I'm sure 75% people stopped reading that's why I went ahead and started with the second movie instead of the first.<br />Alien, is a fantastic looking transfer it looks totally new. If Sigourney Weaver weren't running around looking like a doe-eyed teenager through the whole film I'd think it came out this year. I mean someone put some serious work into this, although this transfer is not exclusive to this disc, it's the same one used from the Quadrilogy set. If you remember the film was released back into theaters shortly before or after the Quad set came out, I can't remember exactly but I know the film was restored from the ground up for this anniversary event this Blu-Ray just features the highest possible quality of that particular transfer/remaster. The sound is as good as I've ever heard for this particular film, I've noticed a lot of little sound effects and even been able to discern some words out of the muttering a lot of the characters did in the film without having to crank my sound system up to 40 (it only goes to30) just to make out what they're saying. I guess that has something to do with the HD audio as opposed to the now standard 5.1 mix. I've watched both versions although I'm more fond of the theatrical version again.<br /><br />Alien 3, is a sharp looking film, seeing it in high def brings a new appreciation to the beautiful sets and art direction, at least it did for me and I've seen this movie a million times... Alien 3? You know the one with the Alien eating all the baddie baldies that no one cares about and holy cow Ripley has also become a baddie baldy and oh no there's a Alien in her too what should we too, how about we all commit suicide by alien just because we hate the company that much. I admit it's not the greatest film in the world but it does have some shining moments here and there. I like it, I still think it was a solid sci-fi flick if only for the mood it created and taking the established Alien series staple of a \\"used future\\" to the most extreme of extremes. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors because he seems to pay extra attention to the atmosphere subtle background noise can create and in the HD 5.1 mix it really comes out. Also concerning the sound, people who've already bought the Alien Quadrilogy will be happy to know that all the audio in the \\"Workprint\\" version has been fixed and it plays just like a normal movie instead of something Fox stole back from the internet and slapped on a DVD.<br />The picture on this film is quite crisp and sharp looking I don't have any complaints about the visual or sound on this disc. It may in fact be the best looking film in the whole set if you can stand the unbelievable crap of the story of the film, it's a pleasure to look at though and exceptionally sound designed.<br /><br />The forth and final film, so far, Ridley Scott has a forward written onto this box set that mentions a prequel film, I've been hearing about one of those since Alien 3 so I'm not going to get my hopes up too high. This movie looks only slightly better on Blu-Ray then the DVD for a film this new I would have expected it to be a little more sharp in HD. Darius Khandji's photography comes out really nicely though. The sharp contrasts and deep dark blacks show up really nicely although mostly this film just seems brown, everything is brown in this movie, even the Aliens are brown! I can't tell if this version is any better than the DVD because honestly I don't know how many different ways there are to convey the color brown regardless of it's encoding. The space shots, the underwater scene all look pretty good though and like I said where there is a contrast between brown and another color it looks really nice. I won't even begin to get into how crap this movie is, but I will say this, it's probably got the most spins in my PS3 since I bought this set mainly because it's the easiest movie of the lot to pick up since there's not much of a story and it's not a very long film.<br />This film is a shining example as to why your director should speak the same language as the cast. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has made some fantastic French films this is his only \\"bad\\" film and not really a bad film but directing actors through an interpreter had to be quite a hindrance. I can barely give directions to the nearest gas station when someone interprets into Spanish for me so I don't even want to imagine what getting a performance out of an actor was like for him. Not the greatest film ever but I think it's watchable and at it's lowest points nowhere near as bad as either AvP film.<br /><br />I was really wanting to type up a short review before I left for work tonight, but apparently I've gotten a bit verbose I apologize to anyone still reading I really am trying to be as concise as possible.<br />This is basically a Blu-Ray version of the previous Quadrilogy set with a few added features, mainly short videos and images here and there, as far as the BRD exclusives are concerned. All of the commentaries and virtually everything is from 2003 so basically Fox just double-dipped the material into a more expensive package. The biggest bonus is that it's not such a hassle to open and get a disc out, everything is contained in a simple little book that holds each disc in it's own page. All the special features from the Quad are contained on one disc while every other stitch of Alien related media is on the final disc.<br />A bit about the Blu-Ray exclusives; \\"Disc-Unbound\\" is a pretty cool idea, a six disc set that also features \\"Muther-Mode\\" where you can select a list of related features throughout the course of a film and then after the film pop in the related disc and play those selections. Kinda a cool idea it's just a shame this is all stuff I have seen a dozen times watching the Quad set. Also all the different audio tracks, subtitled commentaries so if you want to watch the movie with it's audio playing and just read the commentary, which is what I usually do is pretty neat. Isolated scores and on some films totally alternate isolated film scores are also neat in a fanboy way.<br /><br />I gave this set 5 stars for being the perfected version of the old Quadrilogy set which was a 4 star set at best. But in the long run you're not getting much more than the Quad in sleek new packaging with some neat new little gimmicks.<br />I'd like to mention a bit about the packaging, I've never seen anything so sleek and well thought out with the fans in mind. Where with most box sets they just slap a bunch of discs in a generic box and ship it out and sell it to the public. This has got to be one of the most unique designs I've ever seen, it features a book like layout and each disc fits into it's own page with a double wide splash page between each disc. It's a dream compared to all the unfolding and dropping that came with the folding cardboard nine disc layout in the old Quad set.<br /><br />In closing I'd like to mention that if you're looking for the most bang for your buck the old Quad set costs about what this one does and has just about everything this set has to offer minus some minor bonuses, I recommend it if you've got the cash but at the same time the frugal person in me would have probably just bought the Quadrilogy instead. I'm sure they'll release the movies in individual form sooner or later so if you really don't want the third and fourth films I'd just wait for that.then the DVD for a film this new I would have expected it to be a little more sharp in HD.

B00003CXB4|5.0|One of the best Disney movies ever.  The songs will stay with you and you will remember them for a long, long time.
0446618322|3.0|Loved the characters. I wanted that dog! The ending though I felt was really rushed. I mean really rushed. I felt the chemistry between the two characters was really well written. Loved grandma too.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|As soon as the trailer for this set was shown at San Diego Comic Con this year,I knew this is the one set that needed to be in my collection.The price by Amazon was the best I'd seen yet.The overall packaging for the set is really well done.Having less discs this time is much better than 9 in the Quadrilogy set.Now to the meat of this review-The overall video quality varies between the 4 movies.For Alien & Aliens,I would have to give a 5 out of 5.The video is the best I've ever seen for these two movies anywhere.As far as Alien 3,a 4.5 would be appropriate as some of the video in certain parts were a little softer than expected,but to have the extended version with newly remastered audio for the beginning is a definite plus.Alien Resurrection was the least of my favorites,but it looked great-4 out of 5.The audio for all 4 was OUTSTANDING-crisp,clear,and booming in all the right places.All extras were the most comprehensive anywhere.Definitely recommended!
B001VNB54A|4.0|The only reason I gave four stars out of five, is solely due to the gravity and bravado of its predecessor - Band of Brothers.  If not, this HBO Mini-Series would be ranked higher.  The Pacific offers the perfect companion piece to the aforementioned 2001 production, with particular focus on the grittiness of the war in the Pacific theater, in contrast to its European counterpart.  The series pulls no punches, and exposes the rawness of war time combat atrocities, in spirit and emotion.  Humanity rears its ugliest side, with no prisoners taken.    It took me a measly 2 days of sporadic viewing to complete this entire series, and found it compelling enough to do so without being overwhelmed or saturated.  The transfer to 1080p is truly amazing, as every excruciating detail is brought to standing attention.  Every rope fiber, uniform fabric texture, speck of island dirt, and imperfect metal weld seam is seen with ridiculous (in the best way) detail.  If the clarity was any sharper, we all would be suffering from visual lacerations from viewing this series.    Amazon has offered delicious holiday deals throughout, and this little gem is no exception, considering its relatively new release date.  As well, I must compliment Amazon on their expedited free shipping - it was ultra-fast, efficient & all completed before Christmas.  Kudos for superior service and merchandise offerings at spectacular prices.
0671646788|4.0|This book was fantastic. It told me everything i was looking for. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is interested in self development, positive thinking, success building, and self improvement.
0865479186|4.0|NOTE: Going into this review I have something of a scientific background, but have not done extensive research in the medical field. I used to be involved in the community of skeptics, however.<br /><br />This book is something that I feel every person should be made to read before delving into the world of diets, cosmetics, and general health mush. A point I especially agree with:<br /><br />-He mentions over and over again that quackery tends to obscure real science, making it seem, ironically, like some sort of hard to understand voodoo instead of what it actually is.<br /><br />If you are interested in a book which isn't selling you anything but the clearest truth it can find, pick this up.<br /><br />My only nitpick with this book was that the writing style is arrogant; I also felt that some of the commentary on religion was unnecessary, and may actually alienate some of the audience.<br /><br />Otherwise, great book!

0439023521|5.0|I kept seeing all my classmates read this book and I heard it was supposed to be a fantastic book well, THEY WERE RIGHT! I love the action, the suspense its an original plot with original characters and once you start it your hooked, I loved this book and I recommend it to well anyone! Reason being is that I read all those vampire books and stuff so I didn't think I'd like this book, boy was I wrong. I still recommend going to the library first though before buying it.
0393316041|5.0|About forty apparently first-person chapters or stories - collected by Ralph Leighton (who played the piano, and also drummed, with Feynman).  The chapters seem, to me, tape recorded, but the method isn't stated). Edited by Edward Hutchins, introduced by Albert R Hibbs of the Jet Propulsion Lab.  First published 1985; Feynman died in 1988 'after a long illness' - presumably they were published with Feynman's permission, though I'm uncertain as the chapters are all undated.  The book is faintly reminiscent of a book on A N Whitehead by Lucien Price - though the contrast between modes of expression could hardly be more extreme.    Feynman was (judging by these chapters - they may misrepresent him) rather self-effacing and socially inept ('Surely You're Joking..!'), and also not very literate - there are quite a few accounts of his imitating the sound of other languages (Chinese, Italian), and quite a few accounts of his not having read books and indeed whole booklists.  I suspect this made him underestimate plagiarism: his account of ants veers towards Fabre; and every single thing in his popular physics books comes from other sources, in my view, except a bit on asymmetry and tau particles.  The popular, hyped view of a great educator forging new ways of looking at physics is, in my view, completely and totally wrong.    This book includes most of the material for which Feynman was famous - including appreciation of the female form, safecracking, secret codes - though he seems not to have heard of 'Enigma' - and dislike of religion ('Is Electricity Fire?' shows lack of enthusiasm for Orthodox Judaism.    Just a few chapters:  'He Fixes Radios By Thinking!' - an account of his life and experimentation from about 10 to about 18, including inventing his own notations.    'Always Trying to Escape' - something like an account of lucid dreaming, and the psychology of introspection.    'Meeeeeeee!' a not very convincing commentary on hypnosis - Feynman's attitude was like Derren Brown's.    'You Just Ask Them?'  -  Account of the social psychology of girls and also whores - Feynman seems to be unworried by commerce and sex - but the chapter is deeper than that (and rather like another chapter, where a con artist tries to get Feynman to pay to be insured against horse race losses - at each step Feynman works out how the fraud operates).    'Lucky Numbers' - Feynman comes across as a 'calculating boy' (there seem to be no 'calculating girls') using a combination of memorised logarithms, roots, and calculus.  Probably meaningless to innumerate people, though    'A Different Box of Tools' - some of Feynman's triumphs were working out time-saving calculation methods.  But of course since the whole discourse was calculus and related physics, none of this was new or invented by him; he just happened to remember the techniques.  Some people will warm to his accounts.    'Testing Bloodhounds' - quite an amusing account of what is almost a 'damn fool experiment' (Erasmus Darwin - played the trombone to his tulips).  Feynman wondered how sensitive human smell is; the answer is, surprisingly sensitive.    'But Is It Art?' is Feynman on learning to draw and learning that people can be pleased by commodities - the audience for physics being relatively dispersed.   When Feynman was at Caltech - the art galleries and the rest were in places like Pasadena.    'Judging Books by Their Covers - Feynman's venture into the world of book-publishing for schools, and how godawful the books were - and are.    'Bringing Culture to the Physicists' - an account of Feynman decoding the Mayan number system (a complicated thing with bases of 20, and 18) and finding the relationship to Venus - the morning and evening star.  (I'm not sure this is credible - surely others must have worked on this?)    'Cargo Cult Science' at the end is a good chapter on American cranks/ fraudulent science, and on controlled experiments (not his phrase) though maybe he is harsh on people for whom knowledge is so remote that is appears unachievable.  ('Altered States' is another chapter, looking at the vogue for flotation tanks).    ==============================================  My conclusion:    There's an abyss between theoretical and applied physics.  Feynman is unquestionable on the theoretical side.  There are a few accounts of expensive physics equipment - a cyclotron at Princeton (Feynman was ecstatic at its chaos and messiness) and another at Cornell (about a yard across, but could be unscrewed and mended).  Feynman gives no anecdotes about CERN, or electron microscopes (I infer from a mention of ribosomes that he must have had some acquaintance with these).  He doesn't mention radio telescopes, though surely Lovell of Jodrell Bank would have been happy to show him around.  He also, very significantly, does not mention gaseous diffusion at the Manhattan Project.  He has no idea that radar (according to the Chrysler Co) cost more than the Manhattan Project.    One motive I had for checking this book was the specifics of nuclear weapons, since films of tests are now known to include fakery.  Feynman talks of uranium nitrate solution, and also carbon tetrachloride; suggesting no in-depth knowledge.  There's an account of the 'Trinity Test' (in 'Los Alamos from Below') - when Feynman was about 27 - which he claimed to have watched from 20 miles away through truck windscreens.  His account mentions a flash, clouds, and a 'big orange ball of smoke' and a 'tremendous bang'.  This description helped convince me Feynman was a mathematical physicist only; a serious physicist would surely have mentioned other things.  His tau particle asymmetry (for which he got a *joint* Nobel Prize) relies on observations from other peoples' particle accelerators - but Feynman seems never to have checked for artefacts in these devices.  If there was skulduggery, I don't think Feynman was a part of it - he sounds to me a 'loose cannon', not a suitable subject for lifelong fraud.    Not for everyone, but a 5 star performance.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Watched the Town over Christmas and was very impressed with the film. Over all the story is very similar to the story in Heat, but with a slight diffrence. As much as I have disliked Ben Affleck's acting and directing efforts in the past, I think he did an excelent job both as the director and the lead in this film. Over all very engaging and well acted film.

No one would smile at how cute this horrible child is, they would be mortified.  The supporting charcters are so extreme in whatever they \\"are supposed to be\\".  Jess is so environmentally friendly she will not even buy anything.  I am actually angry that she would release this book!

B001U3Y5XE|2.0|I bought this game for my 9 year old son and 11 yr old daughter. We tried to play it today only to find out there are nearly enough bricks to build most of the things in the pictures. I found it very frustrating. I, like some other people posting, feel you would be better off buying a bucket of bricks and being creative-have people guess what you made. I am highly doubtful that this game will ever be palyed again in my house. At least the bricks can be added to my sons Lego collection.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I've watched this movie many times.  Who would not want to switch residences with someone else in another country to get away from their surroundings for a while?  Jack Black, Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, and Kate Winslet are great in this movie.  I thought Cameron Diaz and Jude Law did not make the perfect match but it didn't take away much from the overall concept of the movie.  I would love to have been Cameron Diaz, flying to a England to stay in an adorable English cottage and then have Jude Law knock on my door.  We can all dream, right?  Great romantic comedy.  Will watch it again and again.
0312600844|3.0|Freedom: A long novel tracing the evolution of a family, from multiple viewpoints, and with respect to its ancestors, descendants, and friends, by narrating the difficult love story between Pattie and Walter Berglund that constitutes the family's essence. Depending on who you are, you are most prone to dwell on one of the following three features of the book:    1. The moving bittersweetness of the plot. Franzen manages humor and tragedy, wraps the whole in irony and empathy. Memorably typical characters pursue sorrowfully tragic paths that nevertheless end in redemption, all while commenting perceptively upon each other. The plot works, because a solid and persistently believable, yet (fortunately for our interest's sake) extremely rocky, relationship lies at its core. The milieu and subplots echo, mirror, bracket, and deepen this central relationship, in aesthetically pleasing ways, sometimes by means of patterns hidden just shallow enough to be easily discernible and yet provide the reader with self-satisfaction for his or her perceptiveness. (The repetition of \\"lift,\\" anyone?)    2. The frequently self-conscious, yet enjoyable, virtuosity of the prose. Franzen exemplifies the \\"free, indirect style,\\" smoothly narrating in a way that takes as much account of the inner movements of his characters as of their behavior. He is also prone to nice turns of phrase. (\\"... either she was the world's most expert implier, or Joey was the world's most sensitive inferrer.\\")    3. The striving for epoch-defining detail. Franzen carefully documents the changing North American milieu of his characters, intentionally involving them in those trends and fashions that might be said to constitute the popular essence of our cultural past. Whether this popular essence is in fact what's most worth noting and remembering about our past, or whether it best explains those times, seems to be the question that prompts most intellectual fervor for or against Franzen.    These are the usual main points about the book.    I would also note that Franzen is particularly good at sex. He manages to get at both the superficiality of it and the deep, deep consequences of it, while correctly judging its role and style to the age and situation of individual characters. One is variously amused, moved, and saddened by it. This is truthful.    I am willing to forgive Franzen's self-consciousness -- stylistically and in terms of his attempts at epoch-definition -- because I was moved and because I have nothing against representations of the popular version of the past as long as they don't begin muscling out more subtle, structural, and scientific appraisals. But after a while I was struck by something unfortunate: all of Franzen's sympathetic characters are rather extreme and exceptional. His difficult and remarkable women -- say Pattie and Connie -- are both hostworld's to \\"seas of passion.\\" His conception of goodness reminds one of Cato. His portrait of Richard Katz's ungovernable nymphomania and corresponding worldview remind one of the archetype behind the male leads in gross-out films. And, most unfortunately -- because I could still appreciate a novel full of exceptional people, were it not for this other side of the coin -- the ordinary, the average, the petty people who populate the margins of the narrative are pretty much all unsympathetic. (For example, the female neighbors whose contrastingly liberal and conservative shrewishness informs the free indirect narratives that introduce and conclude the book.)    The book deserves its wide readership on literary terms, but I fear that what conduces its popularity is as much the deliciousness of its implied scorn for the average, ordinary, and petty as the bittersweet of its empathy for the spectrum of the exceptional and intense. Read it; but don't despair if your life fails the implicit test of intensity that would make it worth being the subject of Franzen's next novel.     (Reviews compiled at [...])
B0046M4H70|5.0|Having purchased the re-release of Orlando on DVD back in August, it was with extreme joy (coupled with mild annoyance) that I saw in November the Blu-ray advertised on Amazon for release in December. Joy because I adore Orlando and think it worth a Blu-ray release. Annoyance because I quite wish Sony Pictures Classics had released it simultaneously with the DVD and so spared me the expense. My guess is that perhaps the Blu-ray release hinged on the sales of the DVD, and that the sales must have been decent enough to warrant the Blu-ray. In spite of my annoyance, however, I bought the Blu-ray.    My greatest concern was for the quality of the video transfer: Orlando was made 18 years ago, and on a low budget even then. So bringing it over to high definition might seem like a lost cause.  But, thankfully, it isn't.  In terms of file size the Blu-ray is extremely generous.  Whereas the DVD played consistently between 2-7 Mbps, the Blu-ray maintains a remarkable range of 25-30 Mbps.  Does this show in the transfer?  Mostly.  The greatest advantage of the file size is color reproduction: richer, deeper and, coupled with the resolution of the HD-remastering, greater distinction and detail.  The transfer stills manages to betray its age with residual film grain and artifacts, but this is not unusual for an older live-action film on high-def transfer.  So, yes, this is as good as it gets.  And it is quite good.    As for the audio, the Blu-ray upgrades from the DVD's Dolby Digital 2.0 to a DTS-HD 2.0. [shrugs]    Lastly, the Blu-ray includes a special feature not previously on the DVD: an audio commentary with director Sally Potter and actress Tilda Swinton.  For this I am very grateful.  Orlando was apparently a massive chore to get produced, and it's a sort of miracle that the director and principal actor are still around and willing to talk about it 18 years later.    Well!  Orlando being the gem that it is, I am so *so* delighted that Sony Pictures Classics invested aDVD re-release and Blu-ray release in what still remains an obscure yet remarkable film.  (I think that it also took a little nudging from Tilda Swinton to get them to do it.  So many thanks to her!)    Now, if only Sony would put Bright Star on Blu-ray....
