B001ANSS5K|5.0|I am a huge fan on John Green. But, I thought I had made a mistake by reading &#34;The Fault In Our Stars&#34; as my first John Green novel because that book is so spectacular I thought nothing could compare.<br />Out of all of John's other novels, Paper Towns is definitely a close second to The Fault In Our Stars.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.<br />Especially nerdfighters.<br />DFTBA.

B006XOBFTM|5.0|This compilation enabled me to fill out my Mahler cd collection with several performances that I've loved since my first discovery of Mahler in the mid-60's.  I'm very partial to the Mahler performances of Klemperer and Walter, two conductors who were students and proteges of Mahler from the days when he conducted the Court Opera in Vienna.  Both Klemperer and Walter were intimately familiar with Mahler's conducting of his own works -- and, judging by some noteworthy similarities in style, tone and tempo in the conducting of the two proteges even many decades later, that familiarity appears to have powerfully impressed Mahler's conducting on their memories.<br /><br />The performance of the Ninth Symphony with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra is a treasure of the first magnitude.  Walter captures the ruminative and emotional depth of the work along with its purely musical structure and power.  Of the several performances of this work in my collection, this one with the CSO ranks with the Klemperer performance (with the New Philharmonia) as my favorite.<br /><br />The performance of Das Lied with Mildred Miller and Ernst Haefliger is also a favorite of mine.  I like it much more than the famous performance with Kathleen Ferrier, for example.  In my opinion, Miller's lyricism throughout the work is superior to Ferrier's more declamatory approach.  (Ferrier's overuse of vibrato and occasional problems with initial intonation are additional reasons why I prefer Miller's performance.)  Haefliger's performances in the tenor songs are also generally superior to those of Julius Patzak.  (My apologies for comments that may sound harsh to those who believe that Ferrier's performance belongs in the musical Pantheon.  I do think Ferrier's performance is memorable and wonderful for its emotional power.  But it does seem to me that Miller is more effective in capturing the gentle essence of all of the contralto songs.)<br /><br />There are two performances of the Titan Symphony in this compilation (a 1954 mono recording with the New York Philharmonic and a 1961 performance with the CSO) -- both of them are very fine.  I like the performances of the Ressurection and Fourth Symphonies very much as well.  And the performance of the Fifth is both excellent and important for its influence on the following generation of conductors.  I do regret that there don't seem to be any Klemperer recordings of either the First or Fifth Symphonies!  But Walter's recordings of those works make it easier to accept those gaps in the discography.<br /><br />The Songs of a Wayfarer (with Mildred Miller) and the early Lieder und Gesange (with Desi Halban) are new performances to me -- and both quite enjoyable.<br /><br />While there are some gaps in this collection of Walter's Mahler (no Kindertotenlieder, for example), I'm very happy to have added it to my library of Mahler recordings.this compilation (a 1954 mono recording with the New York Philharmonic and a 1961 performance with the CSO) -- both of them are very fine.

B0059XTU1S|2.0|First, let me say the Lord of the Rings movies were all first-rate and stayed pretty close to the original Tolkien books.  Unfortunately, The Hobbit is not, because it does not.  It really is a bad movie by design.  Choices were made to add slapstick comedy at virtually every opportunity, to fabricate added story lines which bloat, rather than add, to the story, and quite simply to stray from the book liberally to appeal to a young demographic.  The choice to do so is curious given the overwhelming success (commercial and critical) of the LOTR formula of being faithful to the books.<br /><br />Too often scenes from the book have been altered to please young audiences with slapstick/gore/action or fabricated entirely.  Radagast, for example, who was mentioned in name only in the book, appears in the movie as something of an idiot wizard riding a sleigh powered by eight tiny... bunnies.  I'm not kidding.  This is perhaps the worst example of how Peter Jackson has botched the story and put the LOTR movie franchise at risk of ruin, presumably to appeal to a younger crowd, stretch it into 3 movies, and make more money.  There are many other example of this, which  cause you to leave Tolkien's world and wonder why the story was cheapened and botched at the hands of a director who did so well with the LOTR trilogy.<br /><br />I didn't mind fleshing out the 'necromancer' story line that was only hinted at in the book.  But on the other hand I thought the 'unexpected party' scene, the troll scene and the 'riddles in the dark' scene and the 'out of the frying pan...' scenes- the best scenes in the first part of the book- were all disappointing, having been altered for the worse.  The Azog vs. Thorin story line, a fabrication bloating the movie to add some gore/action and give Thorin a nemesis to overcome, was also uncompelling.  I didn't care for the replacement of the goblin tunnels in the book with essentially the orc pits under Isengard, or having the dwarves fall througha trap door and down a long fanciful shoot to the goblin pits rather than have the goblins emerge through a crack in the cave, as was the case in the book.  The battle scenes thereafter are almost entirely slapstick gore, with a mixture of characters falling hundreds of feet onto rocks completely unscathed.<br /><br />Lastly, I don't like how they changed the character of Bilbo Baggins.  In the book, Bilbo (and the dwarves for that matter) are basically out-matched and scared when the meet up with each of the foes in the first part of the book.  Bilbo, after reluctantly joining the group, is basically scared and miserable the whole first part of the book.  In the movie, Bilbo is portrayed more as a home-body who'd just rather be at home, but not terribly scared of trolls or orcs or goblins or dragons, they're just not really his cup of tea.  And the somewhat fabricated theme toward the end of Bilbo deciding to help the dwarves 'find their home' and help them get their home back is another disappointing alteration.<br /><br />There are many smaller details of the movie that also work to cheapen it, but I think you get the picture.  The only reason for 2-stars instead of 1-star is the production values, which are as good as the original LOTR trilogy.  The movie is nominated for a makeup and production design Academy Awards, but a telling comparison with the LOTR trilogy is the absence of any nominations for writing or direction or picture.  Both 'Fellowship' & 'Return' won best adapted screenplay, and were nominated for Best Picture ('Return' won).  The Hobbit could be nominated for worst-adapted screenplay- and seems was a conscious, if incredibly poor, choice by the writers and director- who did so well adapting LOTR to the screen.<br /><br />Equally disappointing is what might have been.  Instead of adding superfluous story lines, they could have made The Hobbit much smaller in scale compared to LOTR (which it is) and more personal.  Instead of starting with a Bilbo that is something of a home-body and not into adventures, they could have started with a Bilbo who secretly always wanted to go on an adventure- but was too afraid and too conforming to society to do so- until Gandalf pushed him along (in the book Bilbo was always into maps, etc. which is meant to suggest this).  From there, they could have portrayed the company of dwarves as serious and determined in their purpose, but totally unprepared for, and unknowing of, the challenges that awaited them.  There could have also been some focus on how miserable Bilbo was in the conditions- the mud, no food, and longing for home- and the friction and disrespect for him by most of the dwarves.  They might have also included how the elves made fun of them when they arrived in Rivendell, and Gandalf's own disdain for many of their failings, and that their adventure isn't his main concern.  Adding a troll scene that was true to the book, this would take about 50 minutes of compelling movie time as Act I.<br /><br />Act II could have started with the company entering the mountains and the cave scene.  Instead of having them fall hundreds of feet unscathed through a trap door unscathed, followed by an hour of slapstick gore battle sequences, they could have had the goblins catch them in the cave, and bring them chained through the tight confines of the dark tunnels in the book, rather than the expansive open pits in the movie.  Being faithful to the book in this case would have led to more suspense and terror- like when the Black Riders first appeared in 'Fellowship'- rather than the slapstick battle scenes that actually took place.  That would have set the stage for Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, and a more tense, drawn-out riddle scene where Bilbo is more at risk and Gollum in control.  After a tense escape scene through the dark, confined tunnels, and the relief at finally getting outside- once again finding themselves out-matched by the goblins and wargs as they find themselvestrapped a top burning pine trees (as in the book), only to be saved once again- this time by the eagles.  This would put the movie time up to around 110 minutes, instead of nearly 3 hours, and get the movie to the same place in the book.  Expanding the 'necromancer' story line (which I thought was a worthwhile link to LOTR) might add some time and make it about a 2 hour movie, with still plenty of plot for an additional 2 hour finale.<br /><br />As it was, I came away thinking of a line that Gandalf used after recounting the story of Bullroarer Took to Bilbo early in the movie, and how he heaved off a goblin's head and it went 100 yards into a rabbit hole, winning the battle and inventing the game of golf at the same time.  When Bilbo replied \\"you made that up\\" Gandalf replied, \\"all good stories have some embellishments.\\"  Perhaps this line served as a bad excuse for what was to follow.  The Hobbit already was a good fantasy story, as time has proven.  It didn't need embellishments.  Especially of the slapstick comedy variety that cheapen the story to appeal to 12 year olds.  It's too bad Peter Jackson couldn't leave well enough alone- to the ruin of the LOTR movie franchise.  I can't say I care to see this movie again, nor buy the disc, nor I am eagerly awaiting the next sequel if it is a botched as this one.  I hope Peter Jackson & Co. will do some serious re-work to their concept of The Hobbit, including re-shooting and re-editing many scenes in this film.

Even if you haven't read any of Frank Herbert's 'Dune' book series, this is an easy-to-follow story, very engaging and entertaining. With an ensemble cast of top quality actors, a tight script, excellent cinematography, very good special effects, good directing and editing, and a moving  musical score, Dune has all the ingredients of a classic Sci-Fi movie.  I've watched it ten times since its initial release, and have yet to tire of it. There are two versions of this movie; a shortened version, which is recognized by an animated prolog and male narration, and the full version, which has Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen) providing the narrative prolog.  Be sure to get the full version.

B000SEH80I|5.0|A friend recommended this to me, when she suspected I may have toxic parents.<br /><br />The book is honest, kind, straight-forward, supportive, and healing. It goes over what a toxic parent is (and isn't -- nobody's perfect, after all). Goes over the different kinds of toxic parents (physical abuse, emotional abuse, over-controlling, etc). And then helps you recover from it and decide how you want to proceed from here. If you want to repair/rebuild/re-balance the relationship with your parents, there's guidance on how to do that. But if you feel it's necessary to just keep them out of your life, that's something only you can decide, but it's okay if you do.<br /><br />Personally, I found this book very healing. It showed me that I wasn't alone, I wasn't wrong for feeling hurt/mistreated, and that how I grew up wasn't &#34;normal&#34; or healthy.<br /><br />Honestly, a few of the chapters (that really applied to me) made me cry a lot. The good kind of emotionally-releasing tears. I'm very grateful for this book. It's helped me find the strength and courage to heal, stand up for myself, and have a better overall life for myself.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|The pros: Great size, easy to use, authentic replica, fun to play with.<br /><br />The cons: There's a little cap over the slider switch (that covers the screw, to put in the battery). It fell off almost immediately. Everything still works fine. The slider switch is still fine. It's just a little &#34;cap&#34; over that part (to hide the screw) that won't stay on. Also, maybe my hearing's just bad, but it says the sonic screwdriver makes two different sounds. It does, but I have to hold it close to my ear to really hear the difference.<br /><br />Overall: It's still a great toy, works perfectly, and is a lot of fun. Great product, great price. The two &#34;cons&#34; I mentioned are so insignificant, I don't notice or care. But to give a fair review, that's all I could come up with. Other than that, it handles well, is a good size, and although it's plastic, it feels sturdy/strong enough for normal use.<br /><br />If you're a Doctor Who fan (especially 10th Doctor), go ahead and get this. My friend ended up getting one too. :)

B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Regarding The Pacific,m a DVD, I had high expectations but only rate this work C+ or B-.  Comparing it to Band of Brothers, it was pretty thin soup.  No combat vet could buy into this; walking through an area with possible enemy presence and bunching up as those troops did is WRONG!  Machine guns firing in LONG bursts is a sure way to burn out the barrel of an a/ir cooled weapon.  The use of grenades was notably absent until the end, and so on and so on.  Moderately entertaining, but nothing I would watch a second time.

I have been in many esoteric Orders that teach a lot of complex ritual designed to get one to the very experience one can have if you actually GET what he is saying in this and his original work &#34;the Power of Now&#34;. For those who've thought the secret to happiness was based on some kind of hard work behind secretive doors, or lots of money, power, etc....it's so simple. We want to intellectualize everything, or make it more difficult than it really is. There is no real secret to discover, we don't have to waste a lot of time figuring things out. Just engaging in the pure power of being right where you are, right this moment. Simple. Amazing.

B003ITZBVS|5.0|I'm a little behind on my animated DC and trying to catch up so I can watch both parts of Dark Knight Returns back to back.<br /><br />Under the Red Hood is a rough adaptation by Judd Winnick of his own writing on the comics title and if he has to rush things a little, he still hits all the key notes.<br /><br />The opening scene is tough to watch. While not gory, the beating that the psychotic Joker puts on the Jason Todd Robin made my toes curl. It's certainly much stronger than we had seen previously in their animated material.<br /><br />That dark and uncomfortable tone lingers throughout the story and definitely gives this a darker edge and I think a strength. The story itself is simple and the mystery of who is under the Red Hood is pretty much telegraphed from the beginning, because that really isn't the point. Rather what we get here is an exploration of Batman's failures and guilt.<br /><br />Inevitably there will be some who complain that it's not Kevin Conroy or Mark Hamill doing the voices of Batman and Joker but I've actually enjoyed how DC have let other people try out their versions of these characters.<br /><br />Bruce Greenwood's Batman has a bit of the Christian Bale voice without being so over the top, I found it effective for the story. It took me a little while to warm up to John DiMaggio's Joker at first, but as the story went on found his mixture of seriousness and manic hysteria ideal for a Joker who is as psychotic as any we've ever seen.<br /><br />Similarly Jensen Ackles (as Red Hood) and Neil Patrick Harris (as Nightwing) effectively embodied their characters. Really there weren't any bad performances to my ear.<br /><br />In fact the only weakness I could really point to was the way the Black Mask was portrayed which made him largely comic an ineffectual rather than one of Batman's most challenging opponents.<br /><br />If you're worried about fitting this into comics continuity I can't really help you. It does appear to accurately reflect the A Death In The Family storyline where Jason Todd died, and at least one of the Joker's origins from The Killing Joke but how that relates to the current status quo is anyone's guess.ct the A Death In The Family storyline where Jason Todd died, and at least one of the Joker's origins from The Killing Joke but how that relates to the current status quo is anyone's guess.
B000TGELLY|4.0|The 2004 screen adaptation of Homers `Illiad' by David Benioff (who currently is regaling us with `Game of Thrones') is director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One, The Perfect Storm) at his longest.  Clocking in at 196 minutes this Director's cut adds more gore and more sex and a bit of filling in the holes left by the initial edit of the movie (though for some reason the physical relationship between Achilles and Patroclus is essentially ignored...).  TROY is a film worth re-visiting for all its spectacle and costume drama.<br /><br />It is the year 1250 B.C. during the late Bronze age. Two emerging nations begin to clash after Paris (Orlando Bloom), the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), to leave her husband, Menelaus (Brandon Gleason), and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles (Brad Pitt at his buff body best), the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans. But they come to a stop by Hector, Prince of Troy (Eric Bana). The whole movie shows their battle struggles and the foreshadowing of fate.<br /><br />The cast is packed with many Hollywood stars and fine stage and British actors including Julian Glover, the imposing Nathan Jones whose Boagrius unsuccessfully fights Achilles, John Shrapnel, Mark Lewis Jones, a very young and very under developed Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus, Sean Bean, Julie Christie, Peter O'Toole, James Cosmo, Nigel Terry, Owain Yeoman (now of The Mentalist), Saffron Burrows, Rose Byrne, and Vincent Regan. The musical score, initiated by Gabriel Yared and finalized by James Horner includes some nice passages, and a lot of `borrowing' from Shostakovich symphonies.  In all it is spectacular to watch and the Director's cut does indeed flesh out more of the characters than the theatrical version.  It wears well.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|I'm having considerable frustration with this app.  Sometimes it seems to arbitrarily send me where I don't want to go.  Sometimes when I click to see who has &#34;liked&#34; a picture from another sourc that I've shared, it takes me to the original source of the item and I can't find just those who liked it on my time-line.  Also ofteh the pictures are  too big for the screen while text is too small.  It probably isn't smaller than the iphone font but it seems that way.  This needs many improvements but the biggest single need is for the option of displaying text in a larger font such as you have in the browser, reader, and some other applications.  Finally, I find the FB app for iphone wonderful, but I wouldn't recommend this one as is at all.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I bought this to make it easy to catch up/review season 1 and 2 before watching season 3. There wasn't any extra noticeble material in the UK version vs the US TV version as far as my wife and I could tell.  However, the Blu-ray HD quality was great, and made watching all those episodes even better.<br /><br />As far as the show, Downton Abbey, is concerned, I love the way the show covers historical events and shows how they affect the people of that time.  The interplay between the classes is interesting too!  Having grown up in Britain it's interesting to see what events and traditions shaped the British culture.  Downton does this well.

B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I have read Lee Child books in the past. This Child novel turned out to be a very good novel. Tom Cruise play a very good character with Jack Reacher. Reacher is a drifter who had police exoerience and legal background plus experience<br />in investigation in the Army. A former sniper shoots and kills five people. He is taken into custody and writes a note saying \\"Get Jack Reacher\\". A short time thereafter Reacher appears at the police station. The sniper's attorney hooks with Reacher. Immediately the sniper doesn't appear to be guilty. This shooting situation starts to have the makings of a giant conspiracy. Some of the forces of evil will surprise you. Reacher puts up a pitched battle to see that justice is done. This is a very good movie. After watchung this movie I am going to start reading Lee Child movies again. Do not miss this movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is an interesting diversion.  It's uncomplicated and fun to play.  It is non-addictive for me (at least) but it's good for a break from other activities.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really liked this book. It was different and refreshing. I work with high school kids so maybe that added to my experience but I thought it was an excellent, quick read. I was immediately sucked in!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I found this movie to be very stirring and well acted. The fact that Paltrow can sing so well as well as Hedlund caught me by surprise. I ordered the CD and now have ordered the DVD. In the future I would love to see more of Paltrow and Hedlund in musicals. The movie ending of Paltrow was disappointing, but was happy to see that Hedlund and his new found love were brought together.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really fun I really recommend it it's really addicting too I enjoy playing it a lot all in all its a great game and it's really fun
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The Game its self is good, but it doesn't save the game your on, and when trying to exit the game the only way is to pause the game; then you have to decide if you want to EXIT (lost of where you at in the game) or having your game in pause mode and then when you try to go home on your Kindle you endup losing where your at in the game. Also when I dowloaded it took forever, then when I tried to go back to the game it does not load, I have to back to the apps section on my Kindle and re-download it, so I can play it agin........ so over all the game it self is ok, but with all the other problems it sucks and I have taken it of my Kindle Device.
1451696205|5.0|This book is an easy read and so funny and powerful! I read it in a day and loved it!
B008O2T3O0|4.0|This was most enjoyable in that the HD 7.1 sound and HD video was truly fine as was the stage direction,sets lighting,orchestral performance and conductiong. Nucci in the title roll is very fine in voice and acting; he is a veteran of many performances in this role. Becala is a good Duke; he is appropriately attractive and he has a powerfull, fairly attractive voice, but, in turns of beauty of tone, not top rate.The Gilda of Mosuc is the weakest link in that her voice is not all that attractive in the highest register. She seems to have trouble easily reaching for the highest notes. She also seems a bit too old for the part in that the character is supposed to be a very young girl. This is understandable in that it would be impossible to find such a young girl who was trained enough to sing the part. In the theatre it works, but with HD video close ups it is obvious. Polgar and Bezala are fine as Sparafucile and Maddalena. Santi conducts with vigor and precision as you would expect from such a veteran of many performances at The Metropolitan Opera.<br /><br />One curious thing is the change from Renaissance costumes in the first act to 19th century costumes in the remainder of the performance. The Duke in the second act looks like he is wearing a modern Van Heussen or Arrow shirt.
B00006JDVV|5.0|the special effects are second to none. I mean the dragons look real. I couldn't tell if the effects were computor generated or if they used models. I don't know if the special effects artist team got an oscar for this movie but they should have. The effects were that good.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is so addictive!its so fun I recommend it so buy it its the best three dollars you'll ever spend

B000TERDNO|5.0|Well I purchased this album because I knew most or all the songs. I was only looking for a few, but found it was better to buy the entire album. The sound quality on this download is very good.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Liked the game only flaw is that you have to buy more diamonds if you really want to get into the game.And make friends thrum the game cause the game don't give you what you need when you need to finish a collection item.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is better then the first one.It entertainment you on a raining day.The details are better and the places  are better than the first one.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|Absolutely love this game - story line, graphics, everything.  Just like almost any other Alawar game.  Highly recommend.  A lot of twists in plot, puzzles, everything you are looking in a game.  Alawar- please more!
B007SOQBCM|4.0|Title says it all, it's twitch in it's full, less chat.  A good app to watch and search streams, just wish there was some sort of chat integration.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|My step father got this for me to convert slides from 1968 to present. I have done 700 and have only a few minor problems. finding if the direction of picture was taken either horizontal or vertical. The top of the heads or whatever picture was some was cut off. simply turned the slide sideways and I got the full picture which can be rotated while editing them. Picture quality is excellent. any prints come out beautiful. of course if the slide quality has deteriated then the copy will show it. i have not tried the 35mm but look forward as when i was growing up in the 70's - 90's I used a Canon Ae-1. I can't wait to get them digital of my family. Very easy to use. highly recommend. Michael
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Btw, I saw the first installment and then bought the season.  Is there a rebate for the 1.99 on the first episode because I bought the season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a cute, simple, and addicting game! You can earn everything rather easily, and it's enough to catch the attention of a kid or adult!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I enjoy this game. I like the different things you have to do. only one problem its not very self explanatory. but I was able to figure it out. well worth my time.
B0086700CM|5.0|Old game I played before, but also loved.  Keeps you busy because you have to pay attention to everything you do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All I can say is this game is super great. Very entertaining. Better game than the first one.  Bigger birds of prey more twists and turns Still packeted with lots of scenes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love this app.  I just downloaded it to my phone.  Like looking at ideals for decorating my house, baby ideas and Dogs
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love how I can quickly switch to any version I want...also can find chapters and verses just as fast...hard to believe you can have all this for free.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Never downloaded this app until now. Have not  use it yet, but it seems to be  a good app for music
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's great! Nothing ever gets me up but this does! Adds are small so they don't bother me! Get it!

B000000OF6|5.0|Was vaguely aware of the group, years ago, but in recent years have come to enjoy them.  This product has all my favorite hits on it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A brand new temple run! I rushed over to get the app faster than a cheetah. I love it so much the twists turns and the brand new atmosphere of the game. GET IT NOW!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Much better, facebook was not very good without. Now I can look at more post before it only showed a few posts.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Every single time i click it turns right off and goes to the apps meun. It's horrible. I HATE IT!!!
B008MEM24S|4.0|We have had lots of fun so far with this game. Everyone really likes it is very easy to play.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|At first I wasn't interested in reading these books.  Was a Twilight fan and didn't think there was a better love, action story out there.  I was so wrong.  I caught the movie on television and after watching it I ordered the Trilogy on my Kindle.  I read all 3 books in a weekend. Could not stop reading them.  I have re read them again.<br />I would tell everyone who hasn't read these books to do so, you won't be dissappointed.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this cd. Contemporary and classic combination. Appeals to all ages. These guys are shooting for the stars & will make it!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|There is nothing I can say about Harry Potter other than I don't think ther will ever be anyone who can beat these books and movies.  They stayed so true to the books, it was a pleasure to watch over and over again.  If you haven't read or watched this series, please do yourself a big favor and watch the movies.  It's fun to see all the kids grow up right before your eyes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I luv the game n all but u cant make the rider look like you.yah, it kinda sucked. BUT its pretty cool other than that.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really enjoyed it! lots of fun and kept me very interested. the storyline is entertaining and not too hard to follow.
B008K6DU4Y|2.0|I was very excited to try this app on my son's Nabi 2.  The options to control the volume, brightness and fast forward/reverse were very handy and easy to access.  Those options did work, however, the app would only play 1 - 2 minutes and would then close down.  I tried multiple times with a movie which was playing fine using the pre-loaded Gallery app.  I suppose we will stick with Gallery for now until I find an app with better controls (screen sizing and subtitles along with the above items) or this one is fixed.  Very disappointed to uninstall the app.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Lets me know exactly how much charge is left in my Kindle.  The best thing, though, is that it recommends tips for a longer batter life, i.e., shutting down unused programs, dimming the light, etc.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest app.  Can not stopping looking into all the ideas for any topic in Pinterest.  Keeps my creative juices flowing!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I can't say much about this, except that it was better than the fourth book and seemed to move along at a much better clip, so definitely worth a look-see.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Its good game to keep you entertained.  Just like the original game we played when growing up. I recommend it. .
B00AREIAI8|3.0|great. game for kids fun wish u started off with more than what u revive horses look real gives kids a hint of owning there own horse
B009X01C64|4.0|The standing case was good however did not like the outside elastic strap.  Would have preferred a flap with magnet.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|this product allows you to connect to your pc from a variety of platforms. I am currently using it on my kindle fire he an it works great. there is a charge to use it on networks swath from home; however at 16.99 per year, it is worth the cost. I highly recommend this product for any kindle user!
0451530780|5.0|What makes a book a \\"classic\\"? Is it the language? The fame of the author? The date of publication? Or, as my high school English teacher used to say, is a book a classic \\"because it still says what it needs to say\\"? In the case of Jane Austen's masterpiece, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I'd venture that it is all of the above. Though it was one of  her first published novels, it's probably her greatest, and features some of the greatest characters ever written in what is quite possibly one of the oldest stories ever told.<br /><br />The plot itself is timeless. The Bennet family of Hertfordshire has five daughters, and with no sons and an estate entailed along the male line, it is important that the girls find good husbands if they don't want to be turned out of their home upon the death of their father. As is common in most families, each child is very different. Jane, the eldest, is quiet and serene, and always sees the good in everyone. Elizabeth is intelligent, while Mary is preachy and a stuck-in-the-mud. Catherine (Kitty) is a follower, and the youngest, Lydia, is an out-of-control flirt. The story begins, rather famously, with the arrival of new neighbors at Netherfield, a home a few miles away. The house has been taken by a young man with a large fortune, and almost immediately, Mrs. Bennet begins scheming that the as-yet-unknown Mr. Bingley will marry one of her daughters - preferably the eldest.<br /><br />As luck would have it, Bingley and Jane hit it off right away. The same cannot be said for Bingley's socially-awkward friend, Mr. Darcy, and Jane's sister Elizabeth. Almost immediately, the two get on each others' nerves, begun with Darcy insulting Lizzie within the hearing range of the latter and continuing as the Bennet family (with the exception of the two eldest) make fools of themselves at every opportunity. When a regiment of soldiers comes to town, Elizabeth is quick to enjoy conversing with a Mr. Wickham, one of Mr. Darcy's least-favorite people, and eagerly believes everything Wickham says about his former childhood friend.<br /><br />Of course, not everything is as it seems. Darcy and Elizabeth continue to meet over the course of the next year, while she is visiting a friend near his aunt's home, and even on his estate at Pemberley. The more they get to know each other, the more they realize they may have been mistaken about one another. And when Lizzie's youngest sister does the unthinkable, the Bennet family's misfortune may end up being the shove Elizabeth and Darcy need.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this book is its characters. Jane Austen was a master of the absurd, and she has captured it beautifully in the obnoxious Mr. Collins, the haughty Lady Catherine deBourgh, the foolish Mrs. Bennet, and so many others. Everyone is drawn to life, and as you are reading it, you realize that, even though the book came out two centuries ago, these are personalities that still exist in all of our lives. The dialogue is witty and to the point, and though the novel is relatively short, the action never lags. There's a reason the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation clocks in at close to five hours; a LOT happens in this book. With the 200th anniversary of the novel happening this year, it's definitely time to take an enjoyable look back at one of the most famous - and well-loved - books ever written.
B0086700CM|2.0|Maybe it's me and I need to see the Grandkids who loaded this for me.<br />I am not understanding this game and perhaps I need more practice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is so cool if you liked the movie than you will deffently like the book  if you like action books than you will like it there are such weird names to  for example prim my kindle won't let me right the rest oh and start out with the first book and watch the movie first
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My Grandkids loaded this one for me and showed me how to play the game.<br />Hah!  I'm ahead of them!  This is fun for kids of all ages.  Good way to take out<br />frustrations.
B005LAII3U|4.0|I liked the original Total Recall movie starring \\"Ah-nuld\\" when I first saw it back in high school. It wasn't a great movie, but it was fun and had plenty of action and sci-fi goodness. I really didn't think it was due for a re-make, yet, and I really wasn't optimistic about the prospect of it being good. Why? Well, Colin Farrell isn't one of my favorite actors and re-makes are not often known to be much better than their predecessors. Still, it had my curiosity up and Redbox is so cheap it's hard to go wrong with a rental, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that this movie was far better than I expected it to be. The acting was good, the action was superb, the storyline was neat (though completely far-fetched), and the production and special effects were some of the best I've ever seen. In fact, it was the fictional world that was created for the story that totally sold me on the movie. So much time and attention to detail were put into creating this fictional living, breathing, functional futuristic world that IT, alone, is enough to grab your attention. The high-tech concepts that were brought to life through the magic of cinematic special effects and computer animation were really incredible. No matter how implausible the concepts were, you can't help but have fun with the movie because they were produced with such high quality and professionalism.<br /><br />Sci-Fi is always escapist in nature, and the production crew that brought this world to life deserve the utmost praise for how well they did their job. Much like [[ASIN:B003EVWDR0 Avatar]], the visuals in the movie upstaged the quality of the storyline. Yes, there was action aplenty and it was all thrilling. Yes, there are two beautiful women set in opposing roles that are sure to get the attention of many guys. But in the end, it was the physical presence of the artifically created world that was the real star of the movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all sci-fi fans!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger Games.is a book that I totally enjoyed .The book is on the kindel therefore I was able to increase letter size to read it .It left me hanging , and encourged me to read the third book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been playing this game for awhile now and have not experienced any errors at all. This is a great game to play at any time, day or night! You certainly cannot go wrong by choosing this app to use to help make those idle times go by faster than ever.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love the game, but it crashes most of the time when you try to use a save.  I could live with out the save  if it wasn't a quest requirement.  Overall a fun game.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Awesome game smoothest combat ever on a kindle fire app.<br />This app should be a five star app. It all concludes to awesomness.
1423124960|5.0|My almost 3 year old daughter loves everything princess right now so this was a great Christmas gift for her.
B0026O475M|1.0|Had to stop halfway through due to an emergency. Next day i still had time in the rental but it would not let me watch it. Not happy
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love this series  and it's characters. This episode did not disappoint. Special effects are amazing and I reccomend this movie
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I really really like that the soundtrack is JUST like the movie, but with longer songs. I have listened to it almost every day since I bought it, and when I'm not listening to it I am still singing it. If you like the songs in the movie, this is a necessity!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing I like the part when you get to ride in the cart.if they make a temple run 3 they should make it be a jungle and you get to swing on vines and slide on trees
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I intend to recommend this to a lot of people and I am so glad someone recommended it to me
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love it my teenage granddaughter told me to rent it and I loved it so much I bought it...great family movie for everyone !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was trying to play it but it kept closing only problem'.' otherwise its a great game and addicting. so fun and a great addition to temple run.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|So I guess it was a waste of money my ipad would not accept it. So maybe one of my grandkids will know how to do it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best ever game it's very challenging and good fun you have to earn as much as you can a gem and some power that you can use when you are in hard or critical level for saving me life to continue all the way until you make the highest score that you are satisfied I'm happy this apps game exclusive for android i have this apps for my apples devices like three iPads and one mini iPad, three iPhones one for my iPhone 5 and two for my iPhone 4 now I have this apps to my Kindle Fire
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is fun and easy to play. If I can play anyone cam. Be prepared to be thrilled! I couldnt stop playing all day long
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the new movements for the runner!  Graphics were difficult at first, being so different from Temple Run, but now play this one more!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My son listens to this CD everynight and loves all of the songs on it.  This reinforces his viewing of the TV show.
0740748475|5.0|This was a belated Christmas present for my son who was excited when it arrived as he had been asking for it for quite sometime. I received it in excellent time and the shipping cost was acceptable and not overpriced. Quite pleased!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This story moved along quite well. I didn't care too much for the ending, but the plot was awesome as it unraveled.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I can listen to the type of music my mood dictates at any given time. It is real handy at work.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a very fun app.The only thing that gets me mad at it though,is the fact that my kindle fire never charges while I play it.If someone could tell what's up with that than this would be amazing.This app is one of my faves.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Remember pac man from the old days when my children used to play. They had great fun with this game. I could not grasp.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not the best John Corey episode. I'm a huge Demille and Corey fan so I expect a lot. Glad I read it and will continue to read anything that Demille writes. Just not the best he's had to offer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am new to games on my kindle. I like this one very much. It is a good way to spend some relaxing time.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! The one liners set this movie up to be a cult classic for generations. It was the \\"Mean Girls\\" of musicals.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game can hard but helps your mind grow. this game may get on your nerves. but don't worrie you'll get it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I could'nt find season three anywhere so I thought why not just buy each episode and play them on the X box...that's what I did and now I'm ready for the mid-season to start back up. This is the best show hands down on TV!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I recently just got a new dvd player for christmas that also plays Blu-ray movies and I am enjoying it alot. I decided to get the complete saga because it has all the movies together. Seeing them in blu-ray is awsome. I like the special edition movie's that george lucas meant to bring out the way he wanted them to be. I wish people would stop complaining about the special editon movie's and please! give George lucas a break, he did nothing wrong. If you don't like what was done to the star wars movies then don't buy them at all for crying out loud, don't be so hard on George.
B00138KDO6|4.0|One of a few i bought today for only three dollars, I'll keep buying if good albums are 2.99 often.
1452111014|4.0|I loved the visuals in this movie so I just had to buy the art book. It is a big book with thick pages and vibrant colours. It contains many pages of concept sketches and notes regarding how the movie came to be and the evolution it went through. I found it very interesting and entertaining to read. There is just the right balance between text and imagery. I will definitely re-read it many times. The different art styles included are awesome to study and see the characters drawn by different people.<br /><br />Some of the characters aren't covered in the book, however. I was disappointed when I got to the end and thought oh... it's finished already! The book is also mainly concepts which is great but I would have liked to see some amazing stills from the finished film in there as well, especially because the printing quality is so nice. Or even stills from the almost-but-not-quite-done stage. There were many sketches of early designs of the characters but it would have been cool if there were similar sketches of the final designs too.<br /><br />Overall it's a stunning book which I highly recommend to any Wreck-It Ralph fan!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I had seen a few episodes of Downton on PBS, season 1, and wondered what all the hype was about. Seemed like just another period piece, with fancy dresses and more money than brains 'upstairs', and overworked and unappreciated servants 'downstairs. The classic (for then and maybe still) story of a 'royal' marrying an American heiress to bail out the family fortune. Maggie Smith (love her) was perfect, but I found it hard to 'like' any of the others.<br /><br />After watching both Seasons 1 and 2 from the beginning, I have changed my mind a bit. And am looking forward to Season 3's release.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Funny, very charming as you would expect from Tina Fey.  A bit disjointed, but worked for her breezy, casual style.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|It dragged a bit in too many spots and didn't seem to connect to any theme-some if the short stories seemed very long because they boring to read. I was very surprised and disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|it was a page turner.. only took me 3 days to finish this book.. she has one hell of a imagination or one hell of a lifestyle..lol maybe both or maybe curiousity i would like to know either way
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app can put me right to sleep no matter how tired I am. The amount of combinations is awesome, letting you create almost any scene you want. Definitely worth getting.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love coin dozed it is so much fun.I even took a suggestion from it and got coin dozed seasons.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Rick Berman really produced a fine 7th and final season of Star Trek Voyager. The special effects and story lines really was in the style of Gene Roddenberry.  Its sad to see Voyager go but it could have lasted more seasons.  I believe it could of touched on more Star Trek themes before returning home.  The Seventh Season is a hit and I will never forget the good chemistry the cast had with each other
0307588343|2.0|This guy still has no idea what happend.  Some people never learn.<br />Plus this book is poorly written story.<br />I give two stars because anyway it kept me amused on a boring day.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun, challenging. I would highly recommend this game; it's even free, plus it gives you second chances if you collect the gems!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|When a friend recommended this book to me, I knew very little about North Korea. But only a few pages into the book I got fascinated by the absurdity of the country's regime and how normal citizens experience it from the inside. The author has very well shaped the first-hand anecdotes she got through interviews with defectors into a storyline that kept me reading. When not reading I enthusiastically told friends about the curiosities I had learned of life in North Korea. I'm very curious to see how the country develops in the future, and how much longer it can keep up appearances. I strongly recommend this book to anyone (remotely) interested in Korea, communism, dictators or societies in general.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Having just finished Tana French's lovingly crafted Dublin Murder Squad series (In the Woods, The Likeness, etc.), I think I was spoiled.  Tana's ability to write convincing characters that I loved to see interact, her masterful chapter breaks (rarely built as plot point cliffhangers but often as poetic internal musings), and command of plot that I usually couldn't predict...<br /><br />So maybe I was just coming off something so good that Hopeless couldn't possibly fill that void. For $3-something on Amazon, and being #1 on the charts at the time... I guess I just didn't feel like browsing around, so I dove in.<br /><br />The first quarter of the book is maybe the best.  Our first-person narrator, Sky, home-schooled and 17, is getting kissed by a boy who snuck in through her window.  She doesn't feel anything.  She feels numb.  She looks at the plastic stars on her ceiling.  Eventually, she kicks him out, and meets up with her best friend and neighbor, Six, who was also hooking up with a boy (and probably enjoying it a lot more).<br /><br />Six is going to study abroad for the next year.  Sky convinces her adoptive mom to let her go to public school for her senior year, or otherwise it's going to be the loneliest year ever.  Six gives Sky a cell phone, which her mother would never allow, that has some pre-loaded minutes so that they can keep in touch.<br /><br />[some light spoilers ahead.]<br /><br />At the same time that Six leaves and school starts, Sky meets Dean Holder in the grocery store.  A man who sets her heart a-flutter for the first time ever.  He claims she looks familiar to him, and he's a bit creepy.  Enter phase 2 of the book: obnoxious, never-ending internal back-and-forth about how Sky feels about this man.  They just keep running into each other, at almost a cheesy level of unbelievability, until they start hanging out proper, and then we never go back: this is now the Sky and Holder show, and it's unrelenting.  Thinking back, probably every single chapter after a certain point is focused on the two of them.  When other characters are introduced, they meet them together.  I haven't read a romance novel in a while.  Actually, probably never.  Maybe this is what romance novels are like.  I don't know.  A huge portion of this middle section is centered around them having their first kiss, with ridiculously smooth dialog.<br /><br />It has its moments, I guess, in the form of some creative scenes: like Sky and Holder playing &#34;Dinner Quest,&#34; a get-to-know-you game where you trade off asking questions, and the interviewee isn't allowed to eat their food until they answer.<br /><br />Okay, actually that's the only one that's jumping out of me.  There's a lot of running, a lot of sitting around, some really unfunny cell phone jokes (Sky apparently has never heard of 'lol' before), and a dash of 'don't let mom find out,' even though by this point the author seems to have largely forgotten about every other character, including Six and her public school experience.<br /><br />The final act of the book turns to unraveling every mysterious thing about Holder and Sky herself.  While I appreciated the change in pace (introducing some conflict in a book that seemed largely complacent with being a teenage romance story), it almost goes over-the-top.  I'm not going to describe what happens, but just know that if I were to describe the final act, it would start with &#34;As it turns out...&#34; and that would be followed by a run-on sentence of things that you probably wouldn't have expected.  Unfortunately, they don't necessarily thematically connect with the story that precedes, and to me, felt tacked on, unrealistic, and kind of cheap.  Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />It's just short enough that I wanted to finish it, just interesting enough to keep me going.  Is it well written?  Sorry, Colleen, but not really.  Did it spark some interesting internal dialogue in my head?  I guess so.  If you're looking for something kinda mediocre to make other good books seem all that much better, check it out!
B001M4YZ90|5.0|I love the cast in this movie. I played with the closed captions on so I could get all the lingo.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|It's everything I ever expected and hoped for from Adele! She says that she wants the expereience to be like sitting down with friends and it definitely feels that way.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|A Dance with Dragons did not drag on as much as 'A Feast for Crows' that was better.  Although detail, and conversation are great, I found myself skimming through some parts because it just dragged on and on.  After 800 pages, a few interesting things happened, but a disappointing few.  The first 3 books were excellent with character building and action, and after that the books tend to be long winded.  Don't get too attached to any of the characters, one of my favorites was killed at the very end of this one. Between the war and the long winter ahead, I am starting to doubt anyone will survive.  That may be for the best though, most of the men in this series kill by the hundreds in battle, mistreat and abuse women and children to the point where a quick death in battle would be kinder. If you are looking for the &#34;happy ending&#34; where the good prevail and all the sociopaths are destroyed, it's not here.  This book ends with as much despair as the rest, and a lot of unanswered questions. I want to know what happens to Bran, Sam Tarly, Arya, and Danearys, so I will be reading the next book at some point.  For now, I need a break from the war.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  My heart pounded through my chest at times, I laughed and cried. I'm so happy for Katie that she had the courage to get away. I love Alex and the children. The twist with \\"Jo\\" at the end while reading the letter gave me chills. I LOVED THIS STORY!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a good game but there is not a lot of things to do all you do is jump in races. I think the people who made the game could do a little better
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|It's an okay movie I guess. Its your typical thriller movie with a twist in the end ... or so the movie thinks so. If you've seen enough thrillers in your life time you can already guess how this ends. I would of gave this movie another star but the lack of common sense by the characters was putting me off. For the rental price of $3.99 it was okay .... if it was free on netflix or hulu I would say go for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought this game was very enjoyable and I love the animals.I love all the games that teach you how to care for a horse!

B00A4AI17A|5.0|2013 marks the bicentennial of the birth of both Verdi and Wagner. There are two sets of operas you should consider ... this set of Verdi from EMI and the complete Wagner operas from DG. They are both terrific bargains at around TWO DOLLARS per disk. Both sets have excellent performances which have all been reviewed elsewhere. The Wagner DG set allows you to access a German-English libretto on their web site. This EMI set has a brief booklet but NO access to a libretto and this is unfortunate.<br />The less popular operas have outstanding performances in this set. These have all be well-reviewed so what I am giving you is the list of recordings. Look them up. There should be a huge \\"WOW\\" and \\"Hooray and THANKS\\" once you read through all the reviews.<br /><br />Here's the list:<br /><br />Nabucco  rec 1977-78  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />Ernani  rec 1982  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />Giovanna d'Arco  rec 1972  James Levine<br /><br />Attila  rec 1989  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />Macbeth  rec 1976  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />Rigoletto  rec  1955  Tullio Serafin<br /><br />Il Trovatore  rec 2001  Sir Antonio Pappano<br /><br />La Traviata  rec  1980  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />I Vespri Sicilliani  rec 1989-90  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />Simon Boccanagra  rec 1957  Gabriele Santini<br /><br />Un Ballo in Maschera  rec 1975  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />La Forza del Destino  rec  1986  Riccardo Muti<br /><br />Don Carlo  rec 1970  Carlo Maria Giulini<br /><br />Aida  rec  1967  Zubin Mehta<br /><br />Otello  rec  1973  Herbert von Karajan<br /><br />Falstaff  rec  1956  Herbert von Karajan<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to listen to all the disks yet but what I have heard does not disappoint. I'll add pocket reviews later.<br /><br />What a great way to celebrate Verdi's bicentennial.

B007UXSPK2|4.0|Nice script, just like the other MI movies in the past, acting is ok, but the draw here are the action sequences and the plot
B000JCE3MK|5.0|Alvin York is a rapscallion. He is self centered and rambunctious. One stormy evening he is returning from the local watering hole when lightning strikes. As a result he gets religion. There is a great war and the local selection board sends greetings to Alvin. No Alvin finds that he is a conscientious objector.<br /><br />So how is he to salve the conflict?<br />The answer is the story told here of a hero and his consciousness.<br /><br />The movie was well paces and had just the right people to play the characters. It was fun to watch how Alvin (Gary cooper) suddenly and progressively alters his look on life. He gives meaning to \\"I see the light\\".<br /><br />I appreciated the scene where he is in on the mountain contemplating the dichotomy of life and defense. It has the same feel as in the movie \\"The Razors Edge\\" where Tyrone Powers contemplates being one with God.<br /><br />Later it was fun to see how Alvin applied his turkey target skills. And asking people to take a few prisoners off his hands.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that can use repeated viewing
B004FHCH96|4.0|Great movie, excellent acting and a brilliant script.  One of his best performances.  Having this as part of the collection was a no brainer!
B003WH765U|5.0|The story is tight and well written. There are no lose ends; yet there is flexibility to speculate what each decision means to the people evolved. For some it is a straightforward love story, for others conflict. Yet it is the conflict that leads to growth and understanding.<br /><br />The actors match the characters perfectly and even though they are major actors they do not overwhelm the characters that they play. For some reason I forget that James Garner is in this movie yet he is the pivot point and catalyst for many scenes as Captain Mike Bailey.<br /><br />The scenery was intriguing. First there was the countryside that appeared timeless yet the theaters were both ancient and modern (for the time period of the movie). I spent an R. &R. in Japan in 1968 (more time in the country then at the Ginza) and had a hard time leaving my self.<br /><br />There is always a residual of the attitudes that were taking place during the Korean War period. And there are many more prejudices to fill the gap today. It is unfortunate that these people do not recognize themselves in the movie (if they did the movie may never have been made), and this alone is what makes the movie worth watching.<br /><br />If you watch it once you will watch it again.
B006H5120E|4.0|Like everyone I had seen this in the theaters way back when and still loved it this time...unfortunately the draw for me was the 3D adaptation which was underwhelming...when I watch this movie again, it won't be with the 3D on...after watching this, I've lost all faith in movies that are upscaled to 3D...if you want a real 3D experience, watch a movie filmed in 3D<br /><br />Was upset when I received as the cardboard pocket for the Blu Ray case was falling apart, glue was coming off...as well, the price of the DVD dropped by $10 after I bought it.  After a long online chat with one of the representatives, they offered me a $5 gift code which is ok
B008PCQDRE|5.0|This film can also be found as part of the Doris day collection.  Not the best one in the collection but still a great comedy with Doris Day Tony Randall and Rock Hudson.  The husband (Rock Hudson) over hears the doctors conversation and knows he is dying. He is a hypochondriac. Little did he know he overheard the wrong conversation. Now he has to find his wife (Doris Day) another husband.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Upscaling video from the 70s to BluRay is going to have its limitations and others who reviewed the product didn't seem to realize that<br /><br />For the price, its a NO BRAINER, should be a part of everyone's collection, just wish they never made a third part!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|For a long time, I was one of those people who bought every one of King's books as soon as they would hit the shelves in paperback. Eventually, however, my love for him as an author began to fade. A few of his books struck me as clunkers and even with the ones I liked tolerably well, I found myself getting irritated as I read them.<br /><br />At least in my opinion, his writing had gotten bloated and rather full of himself. More and more I found myself wanting to smack him on the head and beg him to admit that he did too need an editor--and rather desperately.<br /><br />I did read a couple of his more recent books a few years ago when someone loaned them to me. I thought he had gotten better again but the irritation still remained.<br /><br />When this book came out, I heard a lot of really good things about it. I was tempted to try it but couldn't bring myself to do it. Then earlier this month (January 2012) they had it on a huge sale. For $4, I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />It started off good and I soon found myself fascinated with the story. For the first time in over a decade, I hated to have to stop and was genuinely eager to find out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I'm assuming you probably know the basics of the story so I'm not going to rehash it and I don't want to let loose any spoilers so I'm not going to really get into the plot. While it's definitely interesting, it's the characters that really make this book.<br /><br />The main character, Jake, was both likeable and believable. He's not perfect but you can relate to him and understand his thought processes, his reasons and doubts. I didn't always agree with them but I could see why he doing and thinking as he did.<br /><br />Obviously Oswald is a character in this book, although more on the periphery than a main character. I was impressed with how well he was presented. I don't think anyone would call him likeable but King did manage to present him as a real person. He wasn't a good guy but he wasn't pure evil either or otherwise just a cardboard character.<br /><br />I can't get into details on some of the other characters that I thought he did an excellent job on without getting into the plot. I'll just say that I thought he really brought life and dimension to the people in the small town.<br /><br />There are, of course, some weak areas. The character of Sadie's ex-husband didn't really ring true for me entirely, especially later. I was also less impressed with the connections between some bookies as the story goes on. I wasn't totally taken out of the realm of belief but I thought it was pushing it some. It's not a huge plot point and his last encounter is important to moving the story so I wasn't enormously bothered by this.<br /><br />I'd also say that the book did eventually hit a point where it started to feel like it had,to borrow a phrase from Amadeus, \\"too many notes\\". In fairness, though, I didn't start getting this feeling until very near the end, which is something when you consider the book is over 800 pages long. Even then, that period was relatively short and I found myself drawn back into the story pretty soon.<br /><br />The weak areas of the story are really pretty minor and overall I found this book to be compelling reading. I was really drawn into both the story and the characters and often found myself really hating when that pesky real life made me have to stop reading. I found it to be not only an interesting read but a thought-provoking one as well.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|never received it.  we wrote to the seller and he did not have the product. very arrogant<br />did not refund<br /><br />no stars!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I resisted buying this, even though it was on the bestseller list for months.  But I used a gift card and finally got it.  I did enjoy the book, but the ending was a big disappointment.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I've seen other people with their Kindle and regular cases that only stand landscape and isn't it manly for reading. This case you can turn it either way so easily, I don't know why more don't offer this. I would highly recommend this product.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|This is a wonderful app with a nice variety of sound effects.  I loved the realism of the different rain & water options.  However, it slowed my 8.9\\" Kindle Fire HD down to an unusable crawl - even when the app wasn't running.  As soon as I deleted it, my tablet immediately back to it's previous speed of operation.  It's a great app for what it does, but my tablet could not handle it.  It's nice they offer a variety of free white noise downloads you can get to expand your sound options, but I wonder if these could be part of what slowed down my tablet.  I'm going to try [[ASIN:B007BF4K80 White Noise Lite]] to see if the processing speed issue abates.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I'm think that this game is so awesome kinda like budder but a little better if you like this game you should check out mine craft p e and subway surfers they are all awesome sauce<br />(;
B005LAII12|4.0|Not for little children and can be watched again and again. Find something I missed each time I view it.
0786962984|2.0|Dungeon! is marketed as \\"Fun for the whole family\\", but it's really meant to be played by (or with) young children. If your family does not include any children under 10 or so you may want to try another game. The rules are overly simplistic and the gameplay depends entirely on the dice - there is very little strategy. The outcomes of each round vary wildly (including a 1-in-12 chance on *every* monster attack that you will lose all of your treasure and have to start over from the very beginning) and there are very few ways to influence the game through skill or strategy.<br /><br />I purchased this taking a chance that it might be a fun addition to a game night among adults but unfortunately it is not.<br /><br />Also, the game itself is frustrating because there are numerous cards you must keep separated: 6 stacks of treasure cards, 6 stacks of monster cards, and 3 stacks of spell cards. All of these cards are smaller than business cards and even more flimsy. There are not enough of each type to shuffle properly, but you have to mix them before each game - that is 15 stacks of tiny, thin cards you need to mix up with your big clunky adult-sized human hands every game. It quickly becomes annoying.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the usage of the \\"Cleared\\" tokens is also frustrating. The rooms on the board are quite small and each one requires a token once cleared; a slight bump and they all scatter out of place. In addition, if you roll the dice on the board, you risk knocking over one of many tokens or stand-ups that might be carefully positioned.<br /><br />Clearly this game was designed with kids in mind, which is great, but it's unfortunate that so many online reviews seem to say it's fun for adults. I enjoy simple, imaginative games, but Dungeon! doesn't have enough actual gameplay (beyond the randomness of each roll of the dice) to provide an entertaining experience for anyone above age 13 or so.
B009J2VQSK|3.0|In my opinion, the best song, \\"Guarapiranga\\" by Toco (Original Mix)[[ASIN:B0015K0M7K Guarapiranga - Original Mix]], used during the Dance Competition sequence is missing from the soundtrack. I'm lucky that during the movie I \\"Shazamed\\" it and found out it's name...now I can buy that MP3 instead of this CD that is totally incomplete. Movie was great and the music was great...too bad they murphed on the CD...
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett did not disappoint, an intriguing historical fiction based on real life events. The plot and characters intertwined nicely.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I just completed season 1 on blu-ray (watched the last 7 episodes in a row). This is definitely one of the greatest series ever made.<br />Nothing was left to chance. Especially the script [Achilles' heel of 90% of what comes from cinema & tv] keeps being credible and makes sense throughout the 12 episodes.<br />Photography has also been carefully utilized: long focus lens, colors and lighting, give a \\"theater\\" real look to the images.<br />Music - most of it jazzy - appears when it has to be, having the correct and - again - carefully adjusted rythme.<br /><br />All of that would be a waste without excellent acting - everybody is remarkable, especially the leader roles. This makes a gripping show you never want to end.<br /><br />Watching the \\"Extras\\" gives some hints about why the series is that great: Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa (both executive producers and writers), Sean Callery (soundtrack) [and others] where the main people behind \\"24\\"...
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I heard all the great reviews for this book and thought I must read this book.  I was not impressed.  I found myself reading through it fast just so I could be done with it.  I found it to be predictable and could have been wrapped up in five chapters.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Keeps you thinking once you think you made it not true try again LOL it may look easy buts gets harder as you progress good luck playing. Nice game
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I think I felt all of Megan's feelings along with her. It was a fun, adventurous story that kept me on the edge the whole time. I would love to see Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in a movie made from this story.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was good but their relationship and feelings went too fast. Also, Ana talking about her sex...come on now. Call it what it is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hey peeps I'm back but this time I am going to use pros and cons with Temple Run VS Temple Run 2 I believe most people who plays  this game or looking at this review have played Temple Run.<br /><br />Temple Run 1 pro's<br />Well when Temple Run 1 first came out it was all over the place all my home dogs be play'in it every day!! And I admit it was a very addicting game but like every game maker they had to make it better the main objective of temple run 1 was to run from 4 or 5 ape like monster things and get as much coins as possible and u ran on a flat like that terrain<br /><br />Temple Run 1 cons<br /><br />After awhile it became really dumb. There is no difference after while and soon people will realize the same thing with Temple Run 2.<br /><br />Temple Run 2 pros<br /><br />This game is amazing my homies be chilling on da
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is the best game I have ever played in my whole life! I love it it is awesome!

B00AMBH70S|3.0|Jeremy was good, but it is hard to follow the original Bourne. We like movies without the &#34;F&#34; word but still full of action.
B005LAII80|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about the movie, mainly because I hadn't heard of it and it didn't do so great in theaters, but it blew me away.<br /><br />It's the quintessential epitome of an action film, without all the extra crap shoehorned in,<br /><br />If I had to use one word to describe the film, it would be &#34;badass&#34;.<br /><br />I hope the filmmakers are able to make enough money via BluRay sales to warrant making a sequel. And that they fire their marketing team, because this film should have been a huge hit in the theaters.<br /><br />Watch it, you won't regret it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I'm not sure why, but the story didn't seem to go alone well. First he can't do it, next he don't want to do it. and than he finally does the deeds and wins against all odds....
B005LAIH2M|3.0|This movie was good and has very original story to it. Of course, I'm talking about the after story and not about the whole story that we already know about. I have never heard of the idea of Hansel & Gretel grown up and they are traveling around the world fighting witches. I must say the idea is great start, but is the movie great? I say, NO!<br /><br />The movie had many characters and I believe the casting people did their job right and made a great cast for this movie. I love the casting choice of Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton, and I believe they were Hansel and Gretel. So, I had no problem with the casts in my opinion.<br /><br />I like the costumes and CGI. No problem with that. I didn't watch the movie in 3D, but I did see many scenes that looked to be just made for the 3D effects. All the 2D visual effects I did like and the bloody gore in the movie did look great. It was not over done or underdone in anyway and that's great to see that.<br /><br />As I said for the story line it self was great idea and it works. The movie did its job by showing Hansel & Gretel finding and destroying witches for the whole movie. The movie did its job in telling a main plot for the story. And, the story also tells us a new reason why Hansel & Gretel were abandon in the woods and uses it to fit into the reason why Hansel & Gretel were geared towards being witch hunters.<br /><br />So, what I don't like about this movie. I didn't like a lot of things, but I start off with what I noticed first. I don't like the fight scenes in the movie. The fights are often too fast and not choreography well. What I saw was many scenes throw together and many switching of the camera. The fast camera to camera, back and fore of fighters are way too many times. Throw a punch. Switch! Another person throws a punch. Switch! Another person throws a kick. Switch! Somebody ducks. Switch! And so on. Sometimes, I would see them standing and they would just do a Switch to switch! What??? Why can't they just do more than one thing in a shot? Like punch, kick, jump and throw and now switch or at least two things. Like a simple punch to the guy and other guy punch back? Oh wow. Must be way too hard and complicated! Do they really need to turn many cameras around so that the viewers will get dizzy? Seriously, once you watch that first big fight scene you will see it.<br /><br />I don't like the directing of the movie. Often the movie will feel choppy and a lot of things are just thrown in and it goes to scene to scene, but there are no TRANSITIONS to get to those scenes.  Often, I would be slightly confused and throws me off a bit.<br /><br />The setting for the movie is correct and cool. It looks like early middle ages/dark ages, so characters using crossbows makes sense, but them using guns don't make sense at all. The idea of crossbows and guns just don't mix well. They have guns like old western movies. But, they are dressed up like dark ages look. But some weapons are even more advanced than they should be. I don't believe they should still be riding those horses then. Shouldn't they have vehicles? Why are they living in these cottages? Shouldn't they be living in brick buildings? Why is only their weapons so advanced, but everything else stayed in middle ages/dark ages? That made me wonder and it just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />If they have some high tech gadgets, why not give them some better form of communication too. Really? When Hansel & Gretel got lost from each other, why did they have to yell out to each other? This doesn't make sense? They got all the crazy toys and stuff, but the writers felt they didn't need to give them a good form of communication? Like some signal flares? Actually wait... who needs signal flares? I say just give them walkie-talkies. This movie seemed like they would do whatever it wants at anytime, so give them walkie-talkies. Have them call each other and say, \\"yeah, I'm at our old house in the woods.\\" \\"I'll be there in a hour or so.\\" Now that would had more sense then what we saw in the movie. Gretel is lost. Hansel trying to find her and he is kind lost as well. They both are searching in the woods...but there no real showing of this. That's what I believe they are doing because there not really a TRANSITION to this. Then, bang...we see it and they both are there in the house like they planed to be there at a convenient time. But, guess what? They didn't communicate with each other and so it just happened to be like that. I say NO WAY! Give them walkies!<br /><br />This movie could have been so much better. They would had to just take out certain things that I talked about and do replace with certain things as well. I still recommend this movie because it has an original story and the characters and CGI were great.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|My wife and I decided to start at the beginning and watch the first two seasons. After the first few shows, it is just like a good book that is to good to put down. The writers have so many characters to work with that each week is different. Yet it is all tied together and will keep you coming back.  Maybe even during Super Bowl?????.....Ted
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is exactly as described. it is very fun, my only complaint is that it is one of those games you wish you could just buy the extra gems for!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Excellent book. Opens your mind to a lot of things. It teaches that everyone who goes to church isn't saved, and because someone is different doesn't make them wrong.
B005LAIHYU|2.0|I hate when a movie has too many scenes in which the slow motion goes into play, it takes the moment away. This movie had a buttload of it. After like the 5th scene I was fed up with it. The movie was too short, the acting was stale sometimes and it was like a quick minute story moment then back to action and slow motion scenes. I felt I was watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The actor does look similar to a young Liam Neeson but...the movie was lame. Overall I give it a 4.5/10 at best.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I was quite surprised how much liked the book as I'm not much of a fan of the sport but it was a gold read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So exciting and un-expected! Every episode is a journey. I can't wait for the rest of the season to come!
0812993357|4.0|Grace Coddington is not a writer, but she has lived an interesting life in a world to which most of us have no access.  Sure, we see the results of fashion, but we don't operate on the producing side.  She did.<br /><br />It's refreshing to read a memoir written by its actual subject, and she does have a distinctive voice.  Just not a particularly polished one.  The text is adorned with clever dashed-off drawings, and we get plenty of photos of Grace in her modeling days.<br /><br />Don't expect deep insight and don't expect superbly polished writing.  Do expect some expert storytelling, a fun ride and a peek behind the scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is really fun jumping sliding it is one step better then temple run. i love it and i know you will to
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Surprising and a bit over the top story lines but all in all a nice ending to trilogy. Also by this point  I really wanted more story development than erotic scenes.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I love the movies. I have them all.  Mat Damon is a great actor.  Would recommend these movies to friends
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I like some of his other books better. I read this each night before bed and could always put down after a few pages
B0045XICB2|5.0|I watched all the series except the last one which I preordered.  I love them all and sure will love the last one. Can't wait to receive the last one.
0897500482|5.0|As a fan of the martial arts and especially of the man Bruce Lee you can't go wrong with these books.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Now I'm not going to lie and say I know someone with a facial deformality but this is THE BEST book I have read this year easily and possibly the best book I've read in my entire life. And I've read a ton of books. The author has done an amazing job with this book. One thing I like is she uses parts to inch along the plot. Bottom line: drop everything and read/buy this book now!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this, you can tell that Seiko enjoys making great watches.<br /><br />1.  Some have complained that it's on the small side.  I enjoy the classic look more than the oversized crowns that are showing up recently.  I'm 6'7, 225 lbs and this watch does not look small at all.  Not too big, not too small, just right.  It probably covers about 2/3 of my wrist and I think that's the ideal size.<br />2.  Has kept consistent time for the first week that I've worn it.  Agreed that it'll lose seconds here or there, but that's a small price that you pay for a well crafted automatic at a reasonable price.<br />3.  I'll keep the band (some have mentioned that they have replaced it).  It's comfortable, strong/reinforced, and really fits the design of the rest of the watch.<br /><br />Very well done Seiko
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was tottally helpful I now understand vb better than ever thx for making this game lil smiley faceg guess how much five stars
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Wow! I wish I could get my husband to read this book. It would be wonderful. I will try to employ some of the information and see if it helps. Dr. Chapman does a great job explaining things and many times I really felt his words hit home. It was like the lightbulb suddenly came on.
1439170916|5.0|Almost all of us are going to get cancer or have a close friend or relative who will get cancer in our lives. I hope that even if I found that I had fatal cancer I would feel better by reading this book, by thinking of myself as part of a big human struggle over generations to push back cancer.<br /><br />This book told me everything I wanted to know about cancer (although I want to know even more now that I've read the book; for example, why are dogs, lions and humans the only animals known to get prostate cancer?). First, I wanted to get an idea of what a cancer patient feels like, psychologically more than the actual physical effects of the cancer and the treatment. Second, I wanted to understand the biology of cancer. Third, I wanted to learn about the history of cancer treatments. Fourth, I wanted to find out about modern cancer treatments. This book satisfied all my four goals.<br /><br />The first discovery that helped us to treat cancer was the use of antiseptics and anesthetics with surgery. This allowed much more complex surgery than was possible before these were used. The next was the idea of Paul Ehrlich to look for chemicals that could discriminate between bacteria and animal cells. This leads to the idea of chemotherapy, using poisons that preferentially kill cancer cells. Charles Higgins investigated killing malignant prostate cells by depriving them of testosterone; this is an example of a treatment for a specific cancer that comes from understanding how that cancer works, rather than using a broad acting poison. Another advance is the use of trans-retinoic acid to treat APL, a type of leukemia. The final advances that Mukherjee describes is the use of Herceptin to treat a certain type of breast cancer, and the use of Gleevec to treat CML.<br /><br />The idea of fighting a war on cancer isn't helpful. Cancer is our own cells screwing up, not a foreign body getting into us. And thinking of a war makes us want quick solutions, while we have needed inthe past and will probably continue to need basic research into biological questions that don't have any foreseeable clinical applications, if we want to figure out new ways to treat or prevent cancer.
B0036TGSJ4|4.0|Now a day, your kind of afraid as to what your children are watching,  If your a fan of Emma Stone, this is some of her best work.  A little heavy for those pre-teens, but still a very good movie
B009VA1FN6|3.0|Quite a good story but a bit drawn out in parts no more to say about the story its ok
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I totally recommend this game for horse lovers . It's also fun for kids. This game is pretty life-like. I feel like I'm taking care of a real horse.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|There have been a lot of super hero television shows over the years, but most of them were cheesy.. However, &#34;Arrow&#34; is not one of them.. Arrow is based on the Green Arrow (from DC comics) and does a great job portraying his life on the island that converted him to a hero and then returning to Star City to try and fit into society once again as Oliver Queen.. In each episode of Arrow, he will try and right the wrongs of his father and take down all the corrupt individuals in his father's diary..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun and addictive.  Has lots of new challenges.  Plays great on the Nexus 7.  A &quot;must have&quot; game for every tablet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it lets me take care of a wonderful horse. The graphics. are very well put together.  I am very happy with this app.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is one of the best purchases I have ever made!  Mumford & Sons is a REAL band that plays REAL music on ACTUAL instruments.  The sound is unique and refreshing.  This appeals to all musical tastes.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game. just don't like having to use with facebook and twitter. but love playing these type of games just not having to depend on friends for items.
B00000JGHM|5.0|He is whatcha call a keeper.<br />I buy most of his movies used,<br />I know they are all good and I have a fine collection of his acting for that rainy , cold , snowny days we have so many of here in Michigan to keep myself entertained.........
B0067R0APK|5.0|Great way to use. Very informative. I love this app. I check it every day. I tried other apps and I prefer this one by far<br />.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I own all of her music and she is fantastic, just watch out when you buy some of her albums because she has some that are almost the same album with a different cover and maybe 2 new cuts in it.<br /><br />But even at that I truly think she is one of the best Blues entertainers we have around now,<br />I always enjoy the nights I load my CD player up with 5 of her CD's and lsten to them several times before I add more of her other CD's........ I have yet heard her do anything poorly....<br /> A Classy talented Blues artist of this new century<br /> Buy her you won't regret it.<br />'
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have horses and this is just like I love it more than any other app or game on my kindle fire
0761169253|5.0|This should be a required reading for individuals who consider themselves creative. It's not just limited to the artists and designers — anyone can find value in this gem. I read it in one sitting, and continues to browse through it before I start the day designing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This  one was really hard to figure out! I didn't know where it was going. It's nice to see someone put the government in their place!
0786838655|4.0|As a tenth grader who was advised by many of my peers that \\"The Lightning Thief\\" was a book that they had read in sixth or seventh grade, I had feared that it may not be enjoyable for someone who is used to reading at a much higher level. Contrary to this, author Riordan's use of witty language and in-depth knowledge of Greek gods kept me engaged. The abundance of characters were well developed and were never confusing to follow, like many other books within the \\"fantasy\\" genre.<br /><br />Percy Jackson, the protagonist of the book, is faced with a series of supernatural events with Greek mythological figures, leading to near-death experiences. Once established that there is a connection between Percy and the Olympians, he is immediately taken to Camp Half-Blood. As his powers are discovered, Percy and his friends are sent on a quest to retrieve Zeus's stolen lightning bolt, an adventure marked with extreme danger that is believed only Percy can accomplish.<br /><br />As a tale of self-sacrifice and finding oneself, Percy Jackson works as a relatable yet fantastical protagonist, and the story contains an abundance of plot twists that keep it moving along and engaging. I would recommend this book to people of all ages; there is something in it that everyone can enjoy, such as the immense knowledge of Greek mythology, quick, witty humor, and a captivating storyline.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|The movie is absolutely funny!! I would recommend for everyone to get this movie. It has a good plot about it and all the twist to make it one of the funniest movies out there. So those of you that have not seen this movie, you need to see it now, because if not, you are really missing out.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It has really nice nice graphics and it runs good on the Kindle Fire. I was disappointed that it had limited selections of what you can do in it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Definitely one . Of my favorites. Such a wonderful ending. Definitely didn't see that coming. Can't wait to see the movie
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love to play this game. It is fun. Not too challenging. Excellent way to waste your time.  Dont have to think about it.
B000000WHC|5.0|I love it!!  it came much faster than I expected and in better condition than what was described.<br />I would definitely be a repeat customer, with confidence!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run 2 is better then the 1st because you can swing from ropes.You also get chased by something better and bigger a giant spider monkey.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I love it!!  it came much faster than I expected and in better condition than what was described.<br />I would definitely be a repeat customer, with confidence!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Heard mixed reviews, so rented it and laughed my arse off. End up buying it to look at the outtakes and extras, which were very good. Movie is light, entertaining and a fairy tale story for adults.
B00005JLR8|5.0|I love it!!  it came much faster than I expected and in better condition than what was described.<br />I would definitely be a repeat customer, with confidence!
1595825045|4.0|I bought this for a White Elephant type of game at my family Christmas party. It's amazing! Might have to purchase another one for my own collection soon.
B0002HWJY6|2.0|This thing is way too small! It doesn't even fit a smurf in it! My son was disappointed that he couldn't put his smurfs in their cottage.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have been using Pinterest for less than six months but I really enjoy it - it is the ultimate forum for creative people.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love this show!  Gets better every season.  Amazon on demand is excellent, could not find this full season anywhere else.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Love this CD.  Loved the Broadway play with the original cast as in the CD.  Great listening for anyone alive!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|it ok game it fun but to much pop up ads and it not free when i have no more gem i go to more gem it cost for 1000 or something it cost $99.99 so i think you can get it but not to get it.
B001B0G5WA|5.0|This is the definitive Beach Boys album.  It was a present for our son who loves the Beach Boys alot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am really enjoying this app. It can be challenging but not too frustrating. I have recommended it to friends.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was a Christmas present for one of our dear friends we told about this movie.  She totally loved it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Amazing series, can not wait for series 2 to be released.  Enjoyed it so much I have ordered the books too.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|This is a wonderful album for Christmas or anytime.  Love She & Him.  Would make a great present for all.
B000008JUM|3.0|I have been looking forward to owning the CD for a number of years.  The first half of the disc was surperb, and exactly as I remembered, unfortunately the last few tracks (which are my favourites) kept skipping and would not play properly.
B009G78EE2|5.0|If you've only heard &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; (as was my intro to Macklemore), I strongly suggest you buy this whole album! I watched some of the music videos on YouTube first, but seriously at this price, why hesitate? I'd say about 13 of the 15 tracks I absolutely LOVE and I think they are so inspiring! &#34;Can't Hold Us&#34; is awesome--way to kill it Ray Dalton! I want to start every day with this song. Ryan Lewis, these beats are amazing. Macklemore -- thank you -- for spending over half your life, 10,000 hours plus staring at that pad. The hard work is paying off!
B008ALAHA4|3.0|Works for $10 but should be $5... Works for $10 but should be $5... Works for $10 but should be $5...
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is a awesome app. I would totally get it. It's addictive and if your someone who doesn't what to spend money this is the app get it now while it's free.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Very entertaining Christmas movie. The quality of the animation was outstanding.  I would recommend this movie to all age groups.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and keeps you entertained. good game when you have free time! I like it. I have no complaints yet for the game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It was really entertaining, I have already read it a few times! :) You won't regret buying it.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie was true to life with a great cast, and showed the human side of families with parents who travel and the children who are impacted by it. Good show!
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|It starts out slow, just about the time u want to give up, it gets really good.  Such a sweet story, it makes you want to dig out your old lps and see it you have Cold Fact.  I would recommend this to anyone you knows music from the 60' and 70's.  A &#34;feel good&#34; movie!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's easy to use, and a great way to get the bible. Love that there are many options for plans a and bible translations. Footnotes are good, just wish there were a few more.
0802473156|5.0|I ordered this for my bookclub and it was a hit by all who read it. Good for teens also.
B009JBZH54|5.0|And a simple but great end at that. Yes, there are times of pandering to the lowest common in the final installment of the trilogy (there is a scene where Morgan Freeman is literally bringing the audience up to speed with what's going on in the movie), but it finished strongly enough for me to be more than content. The box set is worth the price just for the bonus feature on the history of the Batmobile - very awesome and my inner Batman nerd is satisfied.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book I just fell in love with. I made all my friends read it. They all loved it! The plot is great some much to it but it is very easy to read and follow along with. One of the best of Nicholas Sparks books. This man for sure knows how to write a good book!!! Everyone should read it!! Very intense!!!
B007VWEEQQ|5.0|In a perfect world Audi will take Apple's balls out of their mouth and allow Droid based phones to sync up with the MMI system but for now this works.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it rocks when you aren't doing anything  you can just play it. its fun on a rainy day my family loves it
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Best app ever. I really recommend it to all ages. It is definitely worth the price. I wasn't sure at first but then I played it on my aunt's phone and I knew I had to get it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I had this game for a few weeks now and have been playing all the time. Its good to pass time. Some levels are pretty challenging
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I can't believe it was free. I really enjoyed it. As an editor, there were a few unpolished moments I would have liked to have fixed, but overall well written. A little bit predictable, but overall pretty unique. Sound like a contraction? Read it, you'll see what I mean. :) Also, I usually skip over love scenes in books, but I actually was quite taken with the ones in this book. Still fairly unrealistic, compared to real life, but very easy to imagine. Overall, I would say the 4/5 stars this book is currently averaging with its 1300+ reviewers is just exactly where it should be. For what it is, it's adorable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really loved this book!! I couldn't stop reading once I started!!<br />So GREAT :) I would definitely recommend reading it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I will tell you that this is the best app ever it's great and wonderful and loads really really fast
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Just as good as it was in my youth. A must read for the twelve year old girl.<br />Give this to a tween you know.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It's ver fast, I like it a lot. Its perfect fory device. I don't have to wait around for it to stream.

B0063GORYU|4.0|Nice for killing time, and plays like your P.C. So have fun with it, Since it was free. At least when I got it. It was free.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome I think that for a free game it's pretty cool i've always wanted a pet dragon!!!!!!!
B009S8PEHY|3.0|Bought this on special because I like Rod Stewart and the price was right. However, it is neither my favorite Christmas music nor my favorite Rod Stewart,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this game on my phone and it is the bomb diggity fresh so get it its almost exactly like temple run but instead of monkeys its inspector and his dog its really fun because you get to ride on trains in the subway and in temple run you never get to ride trains in the subway

B00005N6KG|2.0|I have used the Sony MDR-A35 sport headphones for many years.  They were great because they sat in my ears comfortably and had great sound.  Plus they didn’t slip off my head, were fairly sweat resistant and would fold up nicely into my gym bag.  Unfortunately, one day the sound went out in one ear and I needed to get a replacement.  I was really dismayed to find out that they don’t make that model anymore.  It was a really good product, even if each pair only lasted about 5 years.<br /><br />Now I’ve come to learn that no one makes good folding headphones that sit in the ear. I don’t really like using ear buds when I exercise and all the other styles are annoying.  For one, they’re a real pain to deal with when they’re not in your ears.  I like to just drop the headphones onto my shoulders like a collar when I’m not using them.  Also earbuds are not that comfortable when you sweat. Most reviewers hated the Sony MDR-AS35 headphones that seemed to replace my model (what a difference an S makes) after reading other reviews, I decided to try out these, hoping that they’d be similar to my old Sony’s but without the folding part.<br /><br />Well, these headphones aren’t similar at all.  In fact, they’re not very good.  The biggest problem I find with them is that they are way too flimsy.  They don’t stay aligned on my head.  Lean forward or move to the side and the headphone band moves forward, and then the speaker moves around in your ear and the sound quality gets awful.  If you need to use them when you’re doing any kind of motion at all, these are simply terrible.  Even when I’m on the elliptical machine, they don’t stay positioned very well.  When I wipe the sweat off my brow, that knocks it out of place half the time.<br /><br />When they are situated exactly in the right spot, the sound quality is decent, but not nearly as good as the old MDR-A35s.  So I only recommend them if you’re going to be using them and being very still.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. His master's life through the eyes of his dog.  How enlightening.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|My sister told me to check this film out because she liked it & thought it was funny. This movie is about as funny as a woman getting fisted by a lions paw while getting a colonic. I mean it wasn't funny, not even weirdly funny. It's just weird & stupid. The older Seth McFarlane gets, the more stupid he becomes. The first season of family guy was good, but since then he's delivered nothing but FCC approved soft-core pornographic garbage! If I'm gonna see a porno, I want to know it's a porno first. Don't try to surprise the audience with things that should be labeled adult instead of the R rating they've given.
B00633W614|5.0|Kept wanting to find out what was to happen next.  Can't wait to read the next book.  Jeffrey Archer is always enjoyable to read.
B007XNAQ6A|4.0|It captures the live Duran Duran experience nicely, but the bass is not there. In the early albums, JT's bass is a lead instrument.  The reviews that say the sound is awesome I don't understand.  Duran Duran without bass is not Duran<br />Duran.  Sorry just my opinion.  Everything else sounds great but on some songs all you really hear is Nick, even Dom's guitar is muted.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is VERY interesting and VERY involved with much detail which, seemingly, is historical.  Most authors have one plot while Victor Hugo has inserted numerous sub-plots.  Mind you, I have not finished reading this work; therefore, my opinion might change.  The main reason I have NOT give a 5-star rating is that many words are nowhere to be found in a dictionary.  Granted, those who perform translating most assuredly have done his/her job.  My problem with words which are not found in a dictionary lead to a strong probablilty that I would use those words or one similar thinking all the while that my reader and/or listener understands my intent.  While I have read nearly 50% of this book, repeatedly I realized that I cannot assume the main or minor plot like one might be able to do with other well known authors.  I cannot skip passages because the one(s) I might neglect easily might be the connecting point needed to better catch the entire story.  Good read although tedious!
B0095R64AO|4.0|I thought this was a really cute movie....it just got a little long towards the end.  I think they drug part of the stroryline out a little too far....but other than that..it was cute.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Despite the violence... this was on  of the best book  I have ever read. The writing of it is very good. It made me feel as though I was in the area a myself. It also makes you think... what if this could happen in the far  off future. One of the best yet:)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is everything i cant ply my hands off  its more than i could hope for i would defenitly reccomend
B0094KF4WG|5.0|A true account of one of the most important manhunts of the century.  The authors attention to detail really opens a lay persons eyes to what these people do for our countries, life style and living standards
B006K2WXOI|5.0|I think this is one of the best children's ebooks I have ever seen. The illustrations are gorgeous and the story is unforgettable.  We read it all year round.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is okay if your bored and a single mom lol and I don't really know what else tobsay
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy playing it.  I hope it has a wee bit harder levels as it goes along. It should be fun though.  I have angry birds on my Nook too.  Good .  : )  game for free
B008K93302|1.0|I cannot find the application on my Kindle so I cannot review it.  I can see it but would require me to repurchase it, not inclined to do that again.  Found it, but it doesn't work as I had planned, which was to view converted ITunes videos.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great entertainment. Good graphics. Easy to use. Quick movement of cards, Soto complete make life easier.enjoy playing all the time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Silo Saga is just terrific. It's so inspiring that this series started out as singles published by the author. Just goes to show you that cream rises to the top. I highly recommend this as a terrific read for all ages YA on up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|thus game is probably to most realistic game ive played in a while. the first realistic game for the kindle fire actually. love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the book in only two sittings couldn't put it down! I will be purchasing book three right away!<br /><br />My new favorite trilogy.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|This is a great read, shows interaction between defense and prosecution like never before.  Wide open for next Haller Novel
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can easily say I read this whole book in one sitting. It's just that good. I wish there were more people in this world who had this different outlook on life a the universe. I am completely attached to this book and the characters will always be remembered by me. This book phenomenal. Gus and Hazel showed me true love, loving people even with their fatal flaws. I could probably go on for days about this book.\\"My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\\"
030758836X|1.0|I enjoy realistic books with interesting characters and a good story line. This is not one of them. It begins interestingly enough when the wife disappears but then turns RIDICULOUS.  The main character uses a wine bottle to make it look like she was sexually assaulted - give me a break. And the ending is even more ludicrous.  The book was bad anyways without an ending that makes you wish you had been reading a pleasurable book this whole time. Won't read this author ever again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it a lot there's cool new features and there are even levels to! You will love it if you have the regular temple run and this one to just  as much as I do get it I'm telling you
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|good basic app. You can have good control of thru extras on software. Easy to configure. all we need now is a way to point camera and at subject
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|To be fair, my son loves this app and will play with it until I can't stand to hear it anymore. Personally, it's cute for a few minutes and then it gets annoying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great! The app is great and you can access it anywhere!  Allows you to access all of your boards and has a great layout for searching.  Definitely recommend!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|IF U DON'T HAV THE UPDATE GET IT!! THIS APP HAS AMAZING FEATURES ON THE UPDATE!  IT EVEN HAS A MEME MAKER SUNS!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I have to admit that I probably wouldn't have downloaded this book. If I had gotten it for free. I can honestly say I would have missed out. I enjoyed it and only wished that it was longer.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I found it very good and it kept my interest the whole time until I finished it.&#62; Now looking forward to movie to see if it even compares
B00933JF74|5.0|I really like the game that is not a pay or play I bought the upgrade and can play without spending time and money that get lost when a program glitches. you get more played and less wasted. love it!
B005USZML4|1.0|theodore boone the abduction, by john grishom, was NOT ordered by me. my grandson was reading my kindle and HE ordered it. i just canceled it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have to be careful when I pick up my kindle and play this game.  Too often, 1 quick game turns into 5 or 10, etc. It's fun but I find it time consuming because<br />I have a hard time putting it down.
B008MF3OEY|4.0|This Verso \\"Prologue Marbled\\" Kindle Fire Cover is very classy looking and provides reasonable light use protection for the device. The cover is well made and holds the Kindle in place with elastic straps, which works well for casual use.<br /><br />This is one of the best looking Kindle covers we own but it does not add a lot of protection against a serious drop.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very cool app. thought it was for kids but its fun for us more mature people to. my grandkids will like lt too.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This Verso \\"Prologue\\" case for the Kindle Fire is very well made and gives it the look of a leather bound book that provides fairly good protection as well. This holds the Kindle in place with elastic corner bands that hold well enough for most gyrations that it is likely to be subjected to during a normal day.<br /><br />The cover does draw a lot of attention since it is so good looking so leaving it unattended in public might not be a good idea (I had one \\"disappear\\" when left at a doctor's office). The cover is fairly thick and does provide some drop protection, which is an added benefit.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B00007E7K0|5.0|I was sad when I lost the cover. I was apprehensive about the finish and the fit. But, when I got this, I knew this was the original (or 99.99%).
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I would give it a 5, but I can't play anymore. Whenever I try to open it, it crashes. No more for me until its fixed.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|the movie is alright. I love the actor who plays Hurshy. I think it's worth watching at least once. lots of action and good special effects.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Offers many media streaming options, works flawlessly on Xbox 360. The only thing I find a little odd is that if you have a dlna enabled device then it probably has most of the popular sites available already, but no harm no foul.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very Enjoyable.  The story line and characters remain enchanting and intriguing in season 3 as they were in seasons one and two.
B0098QO7GU|5.0|Great album. My favorite after Sam's Town.<br />Songs are great, especially Be still, Battle Born and Flesh and Bones.<br />Bonus track are amazing too, Prize fighter is really funny.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow...I definitely recommend this game! So many exciting features, fast paced and fun, exhilarating and exciting... the quality is astounding and the game is as smooth as silk! Subway surfers, temple run 1... they're not even close to this game. Get it!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first 1!! Played 4 hrs on end  also got 4 free will not ever get boring highly recommend
B004U8VWLE|1.0|This godawful movie gave credence to the old saying, \\"If the critics like it, DO NOT go see it 'cause it will most likely suck.\\"  How true.  This was one of the stupidest, worst movies that I have ever endured.  The only good thing is that I only paid 99 cents for the rental; had I paid full price at the movies, I would've been REALLY mad.<br /><br />How in the world did anyone consider this dog to be Oscar worthy???
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Title says it all. A good Grisham book. Not his best (The Confession), but certainly well written and entertaining. Bravo.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|What garbage.  Mark Wahlberg, you're better than this.  Take out the \\"F\\" word and there would be no dialogue at all.  Thank God I didn't pay full price to see it at the theater.
B005HSL626|5.0|FAST EASY FUN TO PLAY DOWN LOADED COMPLETELY SIMPLY NO PROBLEMS IT IS SIMPLE I FIND IT HARD TO HAVE TO USE SO MANY WORDS
B006PKV2QU|3.0|It has very cute pictures!  It was a bit hard to follow for a four year old--even a very bright one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|MY GRAND SON REALY HAS FUN PLAYING THIS GAMEI THINK IT IS HARD TO WRITE SUCH A LONG REVIEW FOR A GAME
B001EN71CW|5.0|The Bluray was very well done.<br /><br />I wish this show was still on. It is a shame that Fox decided to broadcast the episodes out of order, in a Friday night time slot with little to no advertising.<br /><br />If you enjoy SciFi then this is a great buy.<br /><br />The movie \\"Serenity\\" was made after the show was canceled. It is more enjoyable to watch after you watch this BluRay.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|As a &#34;Johnny come lately&#34; viewer of Downton, I wanted to catch up on the drama from the very beginning.  I ordered this set and have been watching season one and two so I don't miss any plot twists. I found using the DVDs a great way to do this as I could switch back if I missed some dialogue or didn't understand something.  I had planned to purchase these DVDs from another company for $65.  Luckily, I was getting the daily deals from Amazon and I got them from Amazon for $23.  Really have enjoyed this purchase.
0316228532|2.0|Have you ever wished you could know what people really think of you?  Or wished that some people knew what you really think of them, though you can't or don't want to confront them?  I must admit I did not finish this book, but I read enough that I got the feel of it, and after thinking about it for some time I believe this is what the author was trying to do.  She allowed us inside the characters' thoughts - the good, the bad and the ugly, but unfortunately mostly bad and ugly.  So after coming to this realization I have a bit more respect for this work (so I've deleted my previous 1-star review) and naturally I can appreciate that the book is well written, but I still have no desire to finish it because the characters' interactions with each other are poisoned with loathing, fear, despair, etc., and I shudder to think that this is how life actually is, of which we would all be painfully aware if only we REALLY knew what was going on in other people's minds.
B004UFEJW6|4.0|I watched the movie first when I was a teenager. Love the futuristic setting, love the fighting, and of course love the humanistic touch.<br /><br />Now watching it again on bluray, the story still has me. Not to mention that they have done a pretty good job transferring the movie into high definition. I also like the sound effects a lot, reaching out from the speaker and engulfing, whether it's the sound of the wind blowing or giagantic machinery moving or the input sound of the electronic control panels, all crisp and clear.<br /><br />My only gripe is that they didn't built an all-convincing set for filming the movie(I mean particularly the base where the refugees hide). Perhaps they did't have that much budget to build or perhaps Paul Anderson just did not have a lot of influence in the business back then and were not big enough to make requests like that.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I should have believed the reviews that said this ap doesn't work. (I have a Velocity Cruz so I was hoping it wouldn't pertain to me.) Complete waste of money, won't even open. Very disappointed that Amazon takes money and sells products that don't work.
034580404X|5.0|It was a great Trilogy. I enjoyed each book and they kept my attention,never a  boring minute.I hope their is more to come!!!
B00488SU02|4.0|Keven, Kate, and Laura all did wonderfully at creating a movie that evokes multiple emotions. Enjoy this movie for its \\"keep you guessing\\" suspense, but also for the realism of consequence of action.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|it's a very fun game and I can't. wait for the next level or monster I get.thank you gameloft tot this awesome game
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love the original, played this one for 5 minutes and it crashed! I tried un-installing it and re-downloding it but it's still crashig. I hope it'll be fixed soon.
B000W93CHC|5.0|As I wrote the first time I ordered this book, it is a fabulous story and the pages just fly by.  It is a most worthy successor to Pillars of the Earth.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game and sound effects. Good way to pass the time. You will enjoy playing all levels. Best of all it is free.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I'm currently on book 3 of 5 and, so far, it has met up with all my expectations.  To this point, I can see how closely the tv series has stuck to the books.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is very neat I like it get much  the only thing I don't like is that it has less characters then T.R.1 has but rather then that it's great.
B001E75QGG|5.0|Love all the Indiana Jones movies, and this one lives up to all expectations,  The action is great and the cinematography is gorgeous.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this Bible app. When I pulled up the audio versions of the Bible & read along as it was being said aloud it was so wonderful & enlightening! I highly recommend it :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game us so much fun!and addicting to.  I could play this all day. it is just one of those games you could play at anytime!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|its just what I wanted in weather, always there and always good...up to the task at all times, think everyone should have it
B001F6TXME|4.0|It was the perfect present for my friend. But please don't ask me to leave reviews anymore I don't have time to do it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game makes you think ,look and be fast to beat the timer so you get the star and complete the level
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so awesome this game, i love it<br />1000 review yeah. cool new add ons. lets all think about it, im awesome. party al the time.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|it was a good movie , it hit home for a lot of older couples...this just goes to show you  there is hope
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasaaaaaaa and I think it would be a new comment on this site<br />Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya<br />This app rock's
B000J233SK|5.0|I first discovered Ms. Mckennnitt in 2007, and loved the songs since, being deploye dnow, it was not on my new system so I purchased another one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This new version of Temple Run is beautifully executed! Graphics are awesome and levels are somewhat more challenging. Haven't figured it all out yet, not sure what to do when you get to the cliff...guess I need to read the tutorial, but so far, I love it!
B006P96PAO|5.0|Counter cultural! This movie stands out. This movie needs to be watched by every man trying to leading his own family in the richness of Christian culture.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for book 3!!!! Such an amazing love story!I love how it just kept you reading in anticipation for what was coming next. Loved it!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I did not like this as well as other books she wrote. Very little in the book was about the bone bed. Otherwise it was still worth reading. Looking forward to her next book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|From easy to challenging this is as entertaining as a good game of solitaire.  Knowing every puzzle can be solved keeps me coming back for more.<br /><br />If you don't see the solution the first time, put it down and come back later.  Works every time.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven leaves much to be desired.  I decided to give it a chance and am left wishing there was more to it.  The wordage is basic, the narrative is nothing spectacular.  It's a nice story and that's about it.  The characters could have been more developed, more intimate, the pacing of the story isn't quite right.  I felt this way throughout the book, but held onto hope when the ending surged a bit...but then just ended.  I'm not hard to please, but this one just didn't do it for me.  Not from an author like Nicholas Sparks...
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Great system ever all, just wish they had the halo edition cheaper. But the only concern that I really had was the bottom mat for the ps3 or xbox360 is the Cushing has no air flow vents so this means the system will get hot but not to hot were its a problem. But It is a concern ever all
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It has 3 separate DVDs - Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. This will be one of my special collection. It also has a booklet about the making of the movie and the director's cut. A must buy for all Nolan's fans.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game, I spend hours playing it since it's so additive. Fun for all members of the family.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a fascinating way of looking back at a terrible event in 20th century history.  Having experienced the day myself, I could appreciate Stephen King's imaginative take on this tragedy.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game used a variety of different puzzles to complete the missions. I enjoyed the puzzles. hidden objects. and word scrambles used for each level. The images were very detailed and realistic looking. Overall a enjoyable game.
0783225725|1.0|This is a perfect film for any man who wants to be frozen in time. Every stereotype that a man should aim to defy -- strength through violence, sex through coercion, wisdom through silence and scowling -- is depicted in this film.  Yes, it is compelling and hard to turn away from. I can't imagine many women would enjoy this film.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Enjoyed the humor in the New Dark Shadows. Johnny Depp was great in the title role but suspected the ending.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I enjoy this movie so much.  It has great acting and there are great songs that you get addicted too.  If you are a fan of  the 60s, the Beatles, or British accents definitely get this movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game Rolex upgrade bad girls do it well at the hospital while lampshades are knocked over by big booty kangaroo gave
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I bought this album for my husband, a super RUSH fan.  Personally, I'm not real crazy about the music, but the hubby keeps it in the car and on the ipod and walks around humming with a smile on his face.  I guess that means it's pretty good.If you're a RUSH fan, you will of course not even be reading this review because you will already own it.
B000NA28I4|4.0|I actually like this film, it is very juvenile at times and the main actor is not that great of an actor, however the film was done well.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have had this movie on VHS for years and now on DVD.  It includes the colorized version, which I will likely never watch as I am a traditionalist when it comes to BW films.  No longer will I be tied to the TV broadcast schedule and have to sit through the endless stream of commercials...
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I thought the idea of this was fabulous and thought that if I were to purchase one of the perplexus mazes I may as well go all the way. Well, this is a hell of a difficult game. There are moving parts such as a seesaw and a bucket slide. This is great for kids that are working on their hand eye coordination and wishing to learn more with spacial and plane variations. It's very difficult.
B00007BH5C|4.0|This completes my soundtrack set from the trilogy.  I can literally see the movie in my head when I listen.  Music is inspiring.  I would have liked to tried the full score, but the cost of that is a bit out of my range.
B0041T52S6|3.0|This film is rife with gaming references. It also screams roots to anime and comics, so it is fun. The story line isn't terribly sophisticated, however it is a fun light film.
0553328255|5.0|You get the complete set of Sherlock Holmes stories at a very reasonable price.Just enjoy reading through this classic !!
0783225482|5.0|I saw this as a child and ran across it on Amazon and had to purchase it. The makeup on this is definitely not as good as today's standards, however the story is amusing and light enough for even children (well some nudity, but not sexual - woman getting out of pool naked showing silhouette). There is a moral to the film, which is something I find nice in films.
B004SIP7VM|5.0|Always meant to see this (and had heard many rave reviews) and found it excellent.  One product issue:  the sound was extremely low.  I had the volume on my TV set to 100 and could barely hear it.  I also tried to view the movie in a car and had a similar problem and couldn't watch the movie.  It's DVD quality issue.
B001AG52AG|4.0|The film has a childish whimsy to it mixed with a dark sinister big brother undertone. My niece and nephew love this film, and were unable to pick up on the big brother type themes, so likely it will be acceptable for kids that are younger. My niece is 4 and my nephew 9.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a great game, but sometimes mine lags a little. but I love horses and this is a really fun game!!!
B002WY65VU|4.0|This is one of my favorite zombie movies... particularly as I don't care for horror. This addresses the dark aspect of zombies and pandemic in a comedic manner that is quite amusing. The rules of Zombieland are even more amusing.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|I remember seeing Alien in 1979 at the theater with my (then 20 year old) buddies and as I recall it was a blast.<br />By the time Aliens showed up in 1986 my tastes in movies had somewhat changed, but waxing poetic for Alien I still saw it in the theater.<br />I was not overly impressed with Aliens. There was nothing new, just more Alien which is not necessarily a bad thing but as I said my tastes had changed.<br />In 1992 when Alien 3 was released it was not on my movie watching radar at all, and in 1997 when Alien Resurrection was released I figured it was just a last gasp money grab from a dead franchise.<br />Over the years I saw bits and pieces of these movies but I do not recall ever seeing them from start to finish before.<br />Then 2012 rolls around and Prometheus arrives.<br />Even though I am not a horror fan I am a sci-fi junkie so anything with a spaceship in it at a minimum gets a check out.<br />With very mixed reviews on Prometheus I was skeptical but mildly interested and since you can rent on Blu-Ray for a $1 locally I decided to give it a spin.<br />The Alien Anthology Blu-Ray package also happened to be on sale for $19.99 locally so I figured what the heck, it's cheap, so I bought it and planned a Alien movie marathon for myself.<br />I had read that the Alien movies look very good on Blu-Ray, I try not to overstate things like that but after watching the movies IMHO using the word amazing to describe the transfer is appropriate. I don't know how they did it but the video is a home run.<br />The Alien movie may look better on BD than it did in the original theater release.<br />Everything good that can be written about the movies has already been said.<br />I know I am a `well seasoned' movie watcher and the horror genre is not my thing but keeping that in my mind as I write this, I just don't understand the overwhelming majority of ratings being 5 stars.<br />Don't get me wrong, these are good enough movies, they stand up to time well enough, and they are all worth seeing...<br />Bottom line is I enjoyed all of the movies and watching them back-to-back-to-back was the best way for me to do it.<br />More like one very long sci-fi horror flick than five.<br />No need to watch Prometheus first, and in fact if I had a do over I would have watched it last, even though it is supposed to be the prequel it is a stand alone movie and since it has been 20+ years since I have seen it, Alien would have been better if I had watched it first.<br />Bottom line for me, these are fun movies and worth a spin on a cold rainy day.<br />On a 5 star scale I give the package 3 stars (including Prometheus) and I give Alien 4 stars because it is the concept movie and was ground breaking when it was released.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I read this book, as a review before my son did, and WOW!  I might be a middle aged mother, but there where amazing lessons to learn and to remember packed into this book. These where life lessons that should touch anyone of any age - Being filled with self doubt, believing the expectations others put on you, and never living up to them, believing love only comes in a package that looks and sounds a certain way, and closing ourselves off to other possibilities.  All of these themes are carried in this wonderful book that will touch anyone of any age!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was a great gift for my niece - she has watched it a million times!!  A must buy if you have any little girls in your family!
B009J2VQSK|4.0|From Jessie J to Johnny Cash/Bob Dylan duet, the soundtrack keeps you foot tapping and guessing what's next. Danny Elfman's original score is wonderful, really capturing the quirky, bittersweet tone of the movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|no different from any other solitaire on line game; nice when I'm in the mood for a no brainer. no thinking required
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Was a sucker for the upbeat, humorous, rather quick-paced feel of David O Russell's adaptation. Much preferred the relationship between the father and son; at least De Niro was trying to understand his son, but the dad in the book could care less.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At times easy, at times frustrating. Always fun. Heard about it from a friend & am loving it. Got my son hooked too
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great app.  We love anything Angry Birds at our house.  Great to play while waiting for appointments or waiting in line.
B008VBYN80|4.0|my son started playing this and i got hooked pretty quickly..  very fun.  some glitches but fun nonetheless. getting diamonds is a little tough but fun....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|THIS REVIEW WILL BE WRITTEN BY MY 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER:<br /><br />It's really cool lifelike and fun =D !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't like how it takes awhile but other than that is really really really fun. if you rate it you get gems this game is cool
B0079R8IYW|5.0|This cover is very sturdy and lightweight, it provides great protection for the Kindlefire. I would highly recomend it to anyone with a kindle.
B008XNPO20|4.0|Every now and then, a record comes along that replaces everything else you've been listening to.  'Lonerism' is the album that demands your attention and demands you immerse yourself in it. This album has been a great companion on long winter night walks, as well as the vinyl of choice on my turntable.  It's impact is inescapable.  Kevin Parker has crafted a terrific pop album, that fuses elements of pop, psychedelia and even prog.  How he has managed to create something fresh, exciting and modern sounding, using mostly vintage gear is a marvel.<br /><br />Every track is pure ear candy.  These embellishments are not there to cover anything up, because the songwriting is unbelievably great.  There isn't a weak track on this album, but there are some great highlights like the Todd Rundgren-like 'Mind Mischief'.  \\"Music To Walk Home By\\" has a definite Genesis influence.  Every song has a great memorable vocal hook.  This is what great record making is all about.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|When I purchased Princess Monomoke, I didn't also purchase Nausicaa because I guessed that it would have the same story as Momomoke, but with insects instead of wolves and pigs.  Recently, I was able to watch Nausicaa on television and I was wrong.  It's a different story and it's a good one.  It has some similarities to Origins, but it's not the same as Origins either.<br /><br />I didn't feel that Monomoke was a likeable heroine.  Many times, she acted like a brat that needed a spanking.  Nausicaa is a very likeable heroine.  You want her to win and you hope that she doesn't end up in pieces strewn across the landscape.  Fortunately, that doesn't happen to her.<br /><br />The story has a great deal of action and some of it is aerial combat.  It is a compact story and not a scene is wasted.  There aren't any times when you wonder when something is going to happen.<br /><br />The animation is not as awesome as Monomoke, but it is very good.  The scenes where Nausicaa is flying her powered glider are well done.<br /><br />Is Nausicaa, like Origins, a story that the next generation will want to watch?  I think that it will be, and for that reason, I gave it five stars.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game, but seems to run a little slow<br />My kids love playing it with me, and keeping our pony clean
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Surprisingly,  I really got into these books. I could've done without all the sex, but I enjoyed the story.  Christian is every woman's dream man.  It just shows that everyone is flawed, with or without money.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|This is a good book on the topic of habit. Despite my lack of proficiency in the English language, I was able to read this interesting book. I found the second part, in which some of the scientific findings were applied to business, expanded more than I would consider necessary.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have tried repeatedly to download Temple Run 2 to my new Kindle Fire, but it has not appeared on my Kindle.  I tried to &#34;purchase&#34; the app again and again (it was free), but am told that I already have it.  I don't have it and am unable to get it apparently.  :-(
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Brand new and in perfect condition..works as advertised and waterproof! I purchased this for my wife, and she ended up getting me one as well (black version). The only negative about it is that it is not compatible with non-Apple plugs and most headphones won't fit into the jack...but other than that, it works great.
0545265355|5.0|This is the best trilogy of books that I ever read, you will love Katniss and will cry with every decease
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a pretty neat game. Awesome quality for not paying a dime. Very interactive and fun.<br /> I am not a huge fan of mobile games but this one actually makes me want to sit somewhere and play for a few hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game my daughter loves it  she giggles every time he hit the train  she does it on purpose sometimes
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's story stands out from many NDE accounts because of his knowledge of neuroscience.Skeptics will be hard pressed to dismiss his amazing narrative. I'm grateful he was moved to tell his story and include such detailed information about the scientific aspects of his illness. I found it uplifting and confirming.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|gosh - unbelievable story, really well written and developed. twists and turns, tragedy and hopelessness. great read. that poor little girl.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|This is a book written in simple language and has got very clear message. Great reading. Recommend to everyone. Thanks
B004UNX1LS|5.0|You can always find the music and artist you're looking for. Also connects to Facebook so you can see with your friends.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The two leads are fantastic, especially Claire Danes, who does bi-polar amazingly well. The anti-terror story is relevant and the twists and turns in the plot reveal the shades of grey in our society today.
B000IDGDPA|3.0|2004PG: Good film. Compelling story, but the 'pearls of wisdom' come off as a little pretentious.<br /><br />Just seemed like every time Helen Hunt made a statement her inflection was more of a question (quite annoying) ... bad direction?<br /><br />Really unfortunate since she is obviously a better actress than this film suggests (see: As Good As It Gets 5x) Enjoy MFJLabs 3x
0891349553|5.0|This is good occupational therapy for cabin fever and a very effective teaching/learning experience. Big improvement over a jigsaw puzzle.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read all of the Stephen King books, this was an awesome book to read, would reccomended to anyone........
B004YOEFG8|5.0|I have been trying to find interesting movies to experience 3D on my Vizio television.  Much of this movie is telling about the astronauts who tackled the Hubble Telescope midair while traveling 17,000 miles per hour.  It was very interesting watching how the astronauts prepare for a shuttle launch, but when you get to the footage that Hubble captures, you will be held in awe of how big God really is and how small we are on earth.  Yet looking at earth from the Hubble and looking at the far-off galaxies captured by the cameras on Hubble, you will see how marvelous His creation really is.
0307950654|2.0|I really wanted to like this!  Although I knew it wouldn't be Austen, it was lame as an Austen sequel.  And it wasn't good PD James either.  Oh well, guess the publisher endulged the wonderful old dear.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Great product great service  One of the best musicals ever-a real masterpiece of dancing and singing throughout the film<br />Wonderful
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I played this for such a long time, then I couldn't open it again. I had to uninstall 5 times in a 24 hour time period. Not for kindle fire.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I needed help timing my meditation sessions and this app is handy and helpful. Highly recommend this app to aid in any meditation or prayer.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I read this book with my book club. I probably wouldn't have chosen it otherwise based on the brief descriptions I had read. The chapters were very short, which I  one of the reasons I made it through to the end. There were several times, during the first 70% of the book, that I had to skip a couple pages. I am not known for doing this; the detailed descriptions  were just too much.  On the other hand , I began to think those select parts were well written if I could visualize  so  easily. That being said, I barely made it through and I felt that it dragged at many times. I was reading fast, hoping to get the end quickly. I'm not so sure I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Good quality, was very pleased with it. Was much cheaper then buying it in stores. Check and see if season three and four you can buy together for cheaper.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|The music alone, throughout this movie, will have you feeling good . . . but the movie itself is a fantastic take for any one who loves Bob Marley, Jamaica, or reggae music.  Beautiful cinematography and information about Bob that you probably didn't know.  Will leave you feeling good and wanting to watch it again and again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you read the first then you will like the second one. Keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. CAN'T wait to read the next book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The historical details and true-to-life experiences make this a wonderful series.  We can't wait until season three is available!  Although the very first episode goes slowly, don't be dismayed.  We found it necessary to introduce the wonderful characters.
1595828753|5.0|Anyone who has the opportunity to buy it . Buy it!! Enjoyed the series very much and i recommend it to anyone

B002MQYOFW|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES WAS A TRULY GREAT BOOK.IT CAN STAND THE TEST OF TIME  WITH MANY OF THE GREAT CLASSICS
0786891416|5.0|Or so my husband told me. I haven't had a chance to read it since he is now on his second time reading this! I hope to enjoy it as soon as I get it too!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I is hard to write a book as fast paced as this going from twenty years past to present all the while not twisting the story up so bad the reader is lost in time. Michael Connelley was able to bring me back and forth through time. I would have liked a stronger ending tying up some character's that were forgotten at the end.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Tootsie started out as a comedy of errors for one male actor until he tries to prove how good an actor he is by becoming a &#34;female&#34; soap star. It has a great ending too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|easy concept just gets a little hard i just got the game and i already have 5 million. definite must download
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Even though this was an anniversary gift to my husband, I too enjoyed watching this series. It is well into being tied with Numbers (many of those whom were a part of Numbers are also a part of this series as well!)
B004SOR4H6|5.0|great app. works great simply. and it was free so nothing else needs to be added to this. thank you
B0031RS42K|5.0|The best book from Dan Brown so far. I just couldnt put it away until I was finished. It was a nice combination of politics and science and the whole story is wrapped together just perfectly!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Typical of Albom - he keeps you pondering throughout the story.  Could this really be - a tale as old as time!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game. its a lot of fun! the only complaint I have is everything costing sooooo much!!! ans the really good stuff costs gems. :/
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It fills the gap when waiting in lines. Only complaint is the almost constant popups for other games &amp; ads.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I thought this book would be about adult reactions to a young boy with a badly deformed face.  I expected a grown up discussion and analysis of how different people deal with the unexpected encounter with this social difficulty.  Instead the book follows this young man with a disfigured face as he enters public school.  His interactions with other students and school staff are presented in easily read nicely written stories.  The other children begin to adjust and soon, with only minor confrontational events, they all get back to the business of being children.  This is a nice book for children about children.  Not so much for adults who are more interested in the psychology and education aspects of the behaviors associated with being or meeting disfigured people.  The book is not at all bad, but it is for pre-teen children.
0375842209|5.0|I picked this up at random at a used book store ..... and have been so pleasantly surprised at just how wonderful it is.  The characters and scenes will stay with me for a lifetime, and I will gladly re-read this again (and I seldom ever re-read any but the very best and most favorite books).  Well written and haunting - the characters are so wonderfully drawn and seemed so real.<br />Reading this novel set me off on a long spell of reading much more about WW2 and the Holocaust - and after all that other reading, I think even more highly of The Book Thief than I did the first time around.  Not everyone was drawn in to the Nazi's warped worldview, and there were good people in Germany who questioned the horrors - shown from the children disliking their compulsory Hitler Youth programs, bold Rudy who loved Jesse Owens in spite of Hitler's hate for him, to Hans who helped the Jews in ways both large and small.  As history has shown, most Germans went along with the initially popular Nazis.  After their policies became more extreme, then FEAR of Nazi disfavor and punishment kept the majority from speaking out or acting - I think this Fear is well written into the book - one fears often for Hans and his family throughout the story.  This is a beautifully written piece of historical fiction.  Do not be put off by it being listed as for Young Adults -- I'm in my 50's and found it to be an incredible read.<br />READ THIS!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|THIS IS AN EASY READ FILLED WITH LIGHT AND FUN STORIES OF ENCOUNTERS THAT HAROLD FRY EXPERIENCES DURING HIS UNPLANNED WALK.  THE WALK ITSELF, COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUS TAKES MR. FRY ACROSS ENGLAND WITHOUT PREPARATION OR PLANNING.  THE REASON FOR BEGINNING THE WALK HAS MORE SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS WHICH BEGIN TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO A FORMER WORK-MATE.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I've used it on all my electronic devices. I like the reading plans and the verse of the day. It also allows you to take notes and highlight.
0670026603|5.0|Although this is an easy-read, it's also a heartbreaking love story that draws you in from the start and leaves you sobbing at the end. It is cleverly thought provoking, having life in a wheelchair as its central theme.<br /><br />Will was an active, fun loving twenty-something when his life was drastically changed by a motor cyclist one stormy London morning. He is now a quadriplegic, confined to a wheelchair and totally dependant on others for his every need. He is very resentful of this situation; \\"This is not the life I planned for myself\\".<br />Louisa is employed, not just to help keep his spirits up, but also to watch that he doesn't attempt anything stupid. She only knows that she is to be his carer, along with Nathan, his physiotherapist.<br />Louisa, Will and Nathan form a wonderful trio of sparring partners and their characters are beautifully drawn. Other, slightly less central characters include Will's parents, Louisa's family and her sport-mad boyfriend.<br /><br />It's probably better not to read too many reviews, but to take the book at face value. I did feel that I may have had a bit too much previous knowledge before reading. It's a thoughtful love story, guarenteed to make you cry, and the ending is perfect, it really couldn't have ended any other way.<br /><br />This is a MUST READ!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a very sexy book with two flawed characters. The story was interesting and kept men reading to find out what would happen next.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Perfect family fun! A musical comedy for teens and adults. Great singing great concept! A very well rounded cast, with great talent
B000BM6AVA|5.0|My nephew loved it.  He listens to it constantly.  He put it into his ipod and listens to it while he plays online.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is so good! What a spin on classic fairy tales. All of the characters are played so well. Mr. Gold is by far one of the best characters in the show his acting is superb. This is a must see! You are captured from the very first episode!
B009S0VG42|5.0|MY 14 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER STILL STARES AT THIS CALENDAR EVERY DAY....IT IS A VERY COLORFUL CALENDAR AND GREAT FOR THOSE COLDPLAY FANATICS.  GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY.
B008BTOVL6|5.0|Love the show!!! Its a great way to save money and have all the seasons in one set. Really glad I bought this.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|As I said in the subject line, value is the key to this product.  I am so glad the Kindle Fire accessories are as economical as the unit and it works perfectly.  Too cool!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a really good app....works well and keeps me updated on how much time I have left on my battery...

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game was very fun and it teaches u a lot about careing for horses<br />:)<br /><br />I loved every second of it.  it was so awesome and fun and exciting
B002UD56I6|5.0|It never gets old, my kids love it! They want to watch it all the time. It's the king of pop, God bless his family and his name and legacy shall live on!
B00171R00O|5.0|The story was very inspiring.  Also got to meet Sean Austin in person.  Awesome and very gracious.<br />Great true story - proves with perseverance, anything is possible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Loved the game so realistic it was as if I had a real horse it was terrific and I love it!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|What a wonderful movie, I so enjoyed it I watched it twice...AND laughed more.  Certainly a treat that I did not expect.  Thank you!
B009X01C64|5.0|This thing is nice all around.<br />It has 3 angles to hold the kindle in either portrait or landscape mode.<br />Nicely leather covered and seems like it would be a good shock absorber if dropped.<br /><br />To top it off I got it for 40% off on a special offer.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was introduced to Evernote by a friend. Tried it and discovered its potential and usefulness. A great productivity tool. If you haven't installed it on all of your computer platforms, you need to!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is great. Very fun and really entertaining. not a must have but it's good. I would recommend it for all you horse lovers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very fun.  my boyfriend thought it was a simple connect the dots game but realized it was a good exercise for his brain.
B00785P2QC|3.0|great little free application where you can create your own city. it's got a lot of challenges right off the bat. definitely a more involved game than I expected, so kudos
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Classroom use: Great for teaching points-of-view. Story is perfect for grade 6 or below. Easy read, nice pacing and character development.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing book great for kid that are six to thirteen once again another great Jeff Kinney In the dairy of a wimpy kid series
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I THINK THIS IS A RELLY COOL GAME IT HAS VINES AND STUFF AND I EVEN SAW THIS SPINING THING IT WAS COOL.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I could not stop reading this exciting tale<br /> Lots of historical people and places all coming together with volcanoes going off around the planet<br />.
B0031R5K7M|3.0|Eh. It was okay. I was impressed by the scene in which Eragon forged his own sword, and the battles, but the rest of it was average.<br />The series does seem to be dragging on forEVER! I was excited about reading it at first, and now, at the third book...I'm wondering if my money is worth spending on the last one.
B003KRJNBW|3.0|Great Movie, but there is something wrong with Amazon. we have awesome internet (24 MB download, 5 MB upload) but  there was obvious lag every 10 seconds! It made the movie unwatchable, otherwise I would totally promote Amazon Instant Video.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Be sure you have a towel ready before you watch this movie :)<br /><br />So refreshing to see a movie without agenda, explicit filth, and foul language; just a great story of life and love. And who can be more dedicated in their love than our pets... and this pooch is gifted! The movie is not perfect but the story is perfect. And, true love is always perfect. But don't forget the towels...
1416972242|5.0|I bought the first one for my son for Christmas and he read it in days -- absolutely loved it and asked for the next 2 in the series.  He is now reading City of Ashes and loves it just as much as the first book.
B005ES1232|5.0|These really are great kickers to wear all the time except when playing golf.  I pretty much wear them where ever we go including out for dinner.  We live in SW Florida in the winter and the mountains of NC in the summer.  Have yet to have snow get in through the holes.  If you like comfort on your feet consider this pair or one of their other styles and colors.  I just ordered a pair of boat shoes that are orange and blue.  Gator colors.  That's Florida Gator colors. Go ahead, order a pair.  You'll love them. I wear a size 10 1/2 golf shoe/street shoe and ordered size 10 in these and they fit very well.  Don't be afraid to down size in this style.  This won't hold true for some of the other crocs however.  They really need to standard size these shoes.  Would make Amazon's life and ours much better.  Thanks Amazon for another great product and I never left my recliner while shopping for them.  Such a deal. I can shop and have a lot more time for golf.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loved the puzzles mixed in with hidden objects. Much more challenging and interesting. Bonus games after solving. First part of game free so you can decide if you like it. Well worth the $2.99. Kept me busy for hours. How about some others like this one?
B006H5120E|4.0|I really like this item. The 3D version is really cool and just plain fun! It definatly makes the movie even more enjoyable. Having seen this movie many times I was getting bored with it. However; seeing it in 3D made it enjoyable all over again. Now there are 2 minor issues to discuss. The 3D vesrion is on 2 discs so you need to change discs just when the movie was getting good. I expect the 3D version requires more space than a single disk provides. The second issue is the 3D effect is good but much more subtle than a 3D cartoon with things jumping out at you. However; the 3D efect improoves as the action increases on the second disk. If the water gets any closer you will get wet! The film also contains 2 aditional special feature disks to enjoy. I rateit 4 stars because I think they could made the 3D efects even more entertaining. The Blue-ray really makes everything sharp, clear and look amazing as if you were on board the Titanic. I do feel that your tv size makes a difference. Watching Blue-ray on a 32\\" tv is nice but increesing the tv size to say 55\\" makes a huge difference. You can really get into it and even feel like you apart of the film. Enjoy the movie!
B005USZYDU|5.0|This is a fast-paced book about a young wanna-be lawyer.  It's fast-moving and is a real page-turner.  I'll read another one about Theodore Boone!
B006T5JUFQ|2.0|No wonder people study this in school, it's quite hard to follow with very little storyline to follow. I can see why it is a literary classic, but certainly isn't great holiday reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|easy game to get the hang of. those who know horses will get a kick out of it. give it a try
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|I loved reading this book,the protagonist is a very tragic figure that tries to turn her life around. The use of the concept of the language of flowers, which is the Victorian idea that flowers have a certain meaning, like yellow roses are friendship was really well used. One of the best reads I've had in a long time.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was an excellent story and certainly worth the read. I will look for more by Andy Weir. I liked the humor, i liked the delivery, and I was impressed with how the story unfolded with out relying on implausible circumstances to tie the flow together. The science behind the events was half the fun of the read but the final line was a ripper. Thank you Andy!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It was what I needed. No surprises, it works! The cable was to replaced a lost one, and the efficiency of AMZON in sending me a replacement cable was fantastic.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I liked this book a lot for a few reasons. It was different. Both because of the flowers but also the plot. The characters were very well developed. Felt like I knew all of them, especially Victoria. The writing was exceptional. Easy to read and the prose flowed perfectly.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this one. The main character was flawed, damaged, but so real. I especially liked how the author got \\"inside\\" the character and shared it with us, the readers, in a most compelling way.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was truly touching. Hearing such a horrendous story through the eyes of an innocent child who never knew any better was so realistic. Jack sounds wise beyond his years but still child like to the point where it brings you back to his age and you can identify with him and feel what he's going through. His \\"ma\\" was also such a brave,loving yet fragile character that if I put myself in her shoes I'd hope I could be as strong. I'd love to see a sequel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a great game. It is a nice sequel, and does the original good justice. Stunning graphics, a big scary demonic monkey and a whole lot of running, what more could you want in a game. You could play it for hours and not get bored. The scenery and setting are much better than the first game. This game also has more of an Indiana Jones feel to it with the ziplines, spiked barrel trap things, and mining cart. This is a must have game, I highly recommend it, it is a nice way to pass time when you're bored.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it! but I would like it if this came out sooner! you get bored easily when you have to wait like a year..
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Wow! This book was amazing! I cannot put into words how many emotions I went through. Such a great read! I wonder if the author has a lot of experiences with children because the narration was so good.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Fantastic Series. I believe I will be re-watching this every year for a while. Haven't gotten around to checking special features, but there the journey is great.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|the app is nice but the horses don't have the right gates (leg movement). the tackneeds work it dose not look relstic.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game rocks. Very challenging. You really must visualize each puzzle either before or even during game play. I can't wait tor something similar.
B003EVWDR0|3.0|Avatar is a movie based on a paraplegic ex-marine that finds life on a distant planet called Pandora. Once life is discovered on this distant planet, the ex-marine finds himself battling the humankind from the planet called the Na'vi. The ex-marine must battle and win over the tribe in order to be able to set up his mega-corporation that his slain twin brother had started. The mega-corporation was looking to mine the planet of Pandora for a valued ore.  The biggest deposit of the valued ore, lies underneath the home of the Na'vi. Since the planet has such a hostile environment the ex-marine along with all the other scientist there to mine the valuable ore had to genetically change their bodies to look and act like the people of the Na'vi, to try to win over their trust, and to be able to protect themselves from the hostile environment of the Na'vi. The ex-marine is able to win over the tribe and even meets a beautiful princess by the name of Neytiri. After meeting the princess, becoming one in the tribe, and finally beginning  to understand the secrets of the tribe,  the ex-marine has to decide which side he will take when the day comes for the battle of Pandora.<br />Avatar relates to world religions because it is about indigenous people who live for their land. Everything on the land of Pandora is connected and they have firm beliefs that everything including themselves, the animals and the plants all have connections with each other and their beliefs. Also in order to be part of their tribe on the planet Pandora, you have to be part of initiations and take part of daily rituals. By doing all of these things you then become part of the planet Pandora and part of their tribe. Pandora has its own indigenous people, ways, rituals and initiations, just like any other religion that lives off the land and for the land.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I had read several bad books in a row, and I was happily surprised to come upon CHILD 44. Everything about this book held my interest and wanted to continue the story. It was not until I finished the book that I fully realized it was based on a true story. That impressed me even more. Thanks for a great read, and hopefully many more! RC Lyle
B008PWUYVA|4.0|Durable, functional...Everything that I expected.  I'll be looking for more from Timbk2. A great brand to keep in mind going forward.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It's a nice product, I would recommend it to friends and family.l  I did not know it stands up like in the picture, I will have to try that.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job as a young Bruce Willis in this futuristic hit man/ mob movie. It has splashes of \\"Seven Monkeys\\" and \\"Repo Men\\" (Probably never seen it) it's a great rental or addition to your movie collection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although the subject matter is a bit morose, I think the overall theme in the book is very good.  Once I started, I wasn't able to put it down.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for good quick read with a lot of heart and emotion.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved this book Percy Jackson is still funny and I think that everyone should have the book!!!!!!!! Love it!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|I love the book and the story line, now I can't wait for the next book so I can see how this troublesome relationship really ends.
0321714113|5.0|It's a Bible for C++ developers. You could find almost everything in it. Good book good quality! Why not buy it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are great and the game has a lot of various activities you can make your horse do.  The game doesn't get boring.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was an easy read and kept me interested until the end.  I would recommmend it if you are looking for a light book to read
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Although it is more a dark comedy compared top the old TV series, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Big Jonny Depp fan.  Two thumbs up!
B004478AS4|3.0|Had mixed feelings about this one . It definitively was interesting to read , but it was a bit crude and definively had an ending that I did not expect.  I would recommend it only if you have a strong stomach and do not thrive on happy endings...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Received my first Kindle Fire for Christmas and this was the first game I was excited to play.  Love the challenge, love the sound effects and love the way the colors &#34;follow&#34; the stylus.  The games range from easy to difficult so its great for all ages to play.
B001I45UFC|5.0|EXCELLENT! Can not wait to read the rest of the books.  Even my 7 year old loves the Narnia stories.
B00005OCMR|5.0|great deal
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|A beautiful little tale. Not as sweeping and epic as UP, WALL-E or even CARS, but affecting and exciting in a more subtle and less bombastic manner. See it.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|Great movie
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I am new to the e-book experience, but I've always wanted to read the original Sherlock Holmes stories, so when I saw that I had an opportunity to purchase the complete canon of A. C. Doyle's master sleuth, I jumped right in. I'm very glad I did. I was very fortunate to come across this particular version. There's some nice design work in this, and the ability to jump to specific stories provided in the Table Of Contents is great! I'm still missing the tactile qualities of the printed page, but one must bow to progress at some point even at my age.<br /><br />It only loses a star for not being able to change the backgrounds of the design elements in the body of the book. Each graphic retains its white background when you change the page color to the easier-on-the-eyes sepia shade.<br /><br />Highly recommended to those who have a renewed interest in Sherlock Holmes due to the various TV and movie treatments of the fellow.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Cute game. Definately helps to fight off boredom. Only drawback is that everything customizable costs too many gems. They might let you download the game for free but they make sure there are plenty of opportunities to spend money on gems.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great graphics, great sound effects, and real fun! Easy to get the hang of, and because all the levels are randomized I never feel like I'm playing the same levels over and over.<br /><br />Having said that, the reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because there were a number of instances where something was not explained properly or at all. I'm sure it was clear to the designers as they were making the game, but it must have been lost in translation. Also, it would be great to know how long the power-ups last, not just that my guy's blinking or not. There have been too many times to count where I died literally RIGHT AFTER a power-up wore off. Had I known the power-up was about to expire, I would have taken measures to, y'know, not die.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|An inspirational book from a very inspiring author. Its the greatest pick yourself up book. Paulo Coelho gives his readers hope about the lives they want/dream to live.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is an easy read when you just want a good book.  This one had a good, twisting plot.  Surprised me.
145210655X|5.0|This is a Beautiful, well thought book.  It is just hilarious.  Coming from a fan of the franchise and a parent (who is getting his kids into the franchise also). Is fun to read and look at the illustration. Can relate in so many different levels (especially if your like me: a parent, and either trying or already has kids into Star Wars).<br /><br />Can't wait for the sequel, which Jeffrey Brown is soon to come out with: &#34;Darth Vader and daughter&#34;. Which I will also be able to relate to. hahaha
0440246008|5.0|What can I say? I love every Jack Reacher book. Haven't read one I didn't like yet. The movie with it's pint-sized star is another matter.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Who doesn't want to met and marry a rich, handsome perfect man in Vegas? That's pretty much the fantasy in this book and its well written with good character development and little angst
0385340575|5.0|What can I say? I love every Jack Reacher book. Haven't read one I didn't like yet. The movie with it's pint-sized star is another matter.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I tried the free version and liked it enough to purchase the full version. It worked pretty well except Amazon Game Circle doesn't show Leaderboards. After a couple of weeks' play the sound quit working, no music and no sfx.
044024367X|5.0|Always absorbing, somewhat predictable in that he righteously beats his vile enemies to a pulp, but satisfying to read in these troubled, dishonorable times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading all three books of this series. Wish there were more. Great anytime reading
0515142247|5.0|What can I say? I love every Jack Reacher book. Haven't read one I didn't like yet. The movie with it's pint-sized star is another matter.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will just say it deals with the time travel subject intelligently, at no point was I going &#34;that doesn't make sense&#34;. (Except when old Bruce Willis is with his young wife)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|STILL WANT MORE. IT WAS GREAT.  HOPEP THEY CONTINUE WIHT THIS SERIES.  WOW'D ME.  THIS AUTHOR CAPTIVES A READY FROM START TO FINISH
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book can be at times verbose.  It will not disappoint you though if you stick with it.  I look forward to book three.  After a long day at work this book gave me back my sanity. I love the characters in this book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free flow is one of those games that at first you think its just a waste of your time until you realize you are totally ADDICTED to it and can't put it down!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book starts off like so many others; okay.  Once you meet the &#34;Gone Girl&#34; it takes off and I could NOT put my kindle away.  I thought this novel was intense and gripping.  Very worth the read.
B000SEFM6K|4.0|Almost Dickens with a nod to the murder- mystery genre. Character development is excellent with great word pictures. Good book.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|What a great book and a surprising ending. I was on pins and needles. Couldn't stop reading. Would make a great movie....<br />Amazon
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Dr.Eben Alexander is highly qualified, rational and endeavours to offer his 'best opinions' on a subject that is highly controversial but what matters most is his honesty, openness and sincerity as a scientist.  Science and Religion do not clash, and I feel that this is one of the best examples where an open mind and understanding will benefit, a good read & enlightening... thank you Dr.Eben
B008AK8FHM|4.0|For anyone who has ever questioned the existence of a higher power. This book will reassure you that we are not on our own but loved for unconditionally. That love is also the universal truth in the spiritual and scientific world
0143119680|4.0|I received this book as a gift from a person whose taste I trust. Nonetheless, I wasn't sure what was in store. Witches and vampires? Not my shtick. But I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well-written, intelligent, and a page-turner. I can't understand why so many reviewers complained that they were bored. I was never bored. I don't understand the reviewers who felt Diana was a helpless wimp. Her trials at La Pierre are worthy of any Hero Journey. I also thought the book was funny--and intentionally so--in many places. I didn't feel let down by the ending because I realize there's more to come. Bring on Shadow of Night.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I had no problems with this movie at all, I got it really quick, I am 100 percent satisfied with my purchase.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a great app to have on your Kindle. Fast access to your email to retrieve messages. Highly recommend .
B00001OH7Y|5.0|One of Bowies best album from the eighties. Robert Fripps guitar sliding into the beginning tracks pave the way indeed. A harrowing journey into the world of drugs, government control and a downfall in society. This album is a masterpiece in itself. Ashes to ashes ...funk to funky...we know major toms a junky.Produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great app for the kindle. You can keep yourself entertained or your kids with this game. Recommend for all to get.
0684824906|4.0|This book while time reading it can be longer than normal is well spent. This is an in-depth study of Lincoln and his times.
B006O6F932|5.0|The perfect gift for a girl who is into Monster High. This is a great toy for girls from 7 and up. Recommend from mothers to buy.
0439813786|5.0|What a joy it is to read a story meant for children and enjoy it, love it as much even though I am an adult. I only wish this had been around when I was a child. But, there were great stories then too, &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#34;, &#34;Charlotte's Web&#34; and the &#34;Chronicles of Narnia&#34;. Brian Selznick's book can proudly take its place amongst these classic treasures. I'm afraid I hadn't even heard of the book until I saw the film by Martin Scorsese. I was so enchanted after watching that film, I had to find the book it was based on. I'm so glad I did. Brian writes the way all great authors do. He draws you into his world, introduces you thoroughly to his characters, and generously invites you to join them on their great adventure. That is how all stories should be. Thank you for such a gem.
B00000IWVS|5.0|good purches exelent product verry southing music . exelent way to wind down the after a stressful day . blaa blaa
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Been a long time since I read a good spy thriller, so downloaded this after reading the other reviews. Very much enjoyed the writing and the characters, very fast paced action, and a very current story line, although the ending was possibly a little too rushed and contrived. Have now downloaded four more Clancy books, to catch up on the characters since 1988!
0060775858|5.0|You know that feeling when you go on vacation and towards the end you just long to be in your own comfortable home and get back to your regular routine. Then once you finally arrive home you feel a sigh of relief. This book seems to give children that type of comfort and feeling every time they hear it. They love the pictures and never seem to tire of the story. It's such a simple book but kids love it and that's what matters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I first saw temple run 2 in the app store I thought it was a temple run remake by somebody other than imangi studios. After I read the reviews and the discription, I knew that I wanted it and it was not a temple run wanna be.  After I bought it I saw how different it was from the original (in a good way). Like all the glitches fixed, new areas!! I will not say anymore, I do not want to spoil the awsomeness.  TOTALLY BUY IT!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is like a million times better than the original!! My favorite parts are the mines because they are very challenging and fast paced. I really think that the forest could use some work but it is okay. I love this game!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book, kept me guessing until the truth about certain characters began to trickle in. Even then, the author kept me changing my mind as to who the bad person really was and whether I was picking up on the right signals or missing something. Cant ask for more from a &#34;whodunit&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great game for horse lover's around the world:) :) my sister and I play it all the time. we think it rocks. not hard but not easy either.
B0049IHX2C|4.0|Better than most sequels, MIB II had a good story line and was well done.  Recommended as a free standing presentation as well as a sequel.  It could have had a totally different title and still been good.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Great for beginning to match names with heavenly bodies -stars, planets for average enthusiast. Very happy it works w/o need for internet connection. No need for the sounds; glad that can be turned off. Still unable to discover how to use the added purchase of Sky Information pack.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the game but when I click on the save me the game freezes then force closes on me and I loose all my progress I made in the run.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So fun! Makes me feel like I have my own horse!! And I get to play it with my best friend!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun. Easy to use and easy to play. I definitely recommend it to kill time. Especially when you're bored.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game helps people learn how to care for a real horse and this game is awesome
B00B2V66VS|3.0|TR2 runs fine on my thunderbolt. But there is no option to exit the app. I have to FC it.
B004X60QE2|1.0|A very silly show with bad acting. Do not waste your time or money. Not much more left to say.....
B008IJTFYW|2.0|I have had this for prob 3 months n I loved it...4 days ago it started the force close problem.  I cant use it n now I'm not sleeping well.  2 stars till I can actually use it again...
0007259352|5.0|For both my wife and for me we found this a wonderful book. It tells the story of an extended family during the Biafran war. The story is full of life and love, not always easy, and a true portrayal of both life and war. It's the best book I've read over the past year -- since reading &#34;Cutting for Stone.&#34; I recommend it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Glad I stumbled upon this book. Finally something that held my interest the whole way through.  Hope there is a sequel.
B007Y1JGOY|4.0|Delain is fast becoming one of my go to bands to listen to. I found the first CD in the $1.98 bin and have been hooked every since. I have all 3 albums and enjoy them all.<br />The third is not my favorite however. It just doesn't work as well as Lucidity and April Rain for me. But the songs are still great and the singing is strong.<br />I recommend listening for yourself. :)
0684824906|5.0|Very well written and it reads easily, like a story, not stuffy.  The research that was completed for this book was incredible.  A lot better read than some of the other books that have been written i.e. Einstein, or George Washington....which ended up back on the bookshelf prior to finishing.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I haven't read the comic/graphic novel, but the movie is completely fun. The extended edition gives you more of what you like from this movie. Actually, it gives you more story. Very fun and graphically satisfying movie.
B005LAIH5O|1.0|regret we bought this. Got it for thanksgiving day sale and it sucks.....guess we will just think twice and read reviews before purchasing next year!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I found this movie to be a wonderful rendition of the fairy tale. No Disney here!!!<br />The original fairy tales are much more dark than the Disney animated films.<br />This is a nicely dark tale of the Snow White story. Well done.<br />The acting is fantastic, the costumes superb. The story is wonderful.<br />I really enjoyed the movie and look forward to watching my DVD again and again.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Love these songs!!! highly recommend. I would say this one is a tad slower than some of the others but very good either way.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I know I'm not the first person to give this 5 stars. This movie is fantastic!!!<br />You get the amazing portrayals of the comic book heroes & villain from all these wonderful actors.<br />This is one of the best comic book movies to date (and I've seen just about all of them....starting with Superman from the 50s).<br />It's entertaining, it brings you into the world, it stimulates all your senses.<br />Well done to all those who worked on this. Can't wait for all the follow up movies to come.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I liked the second installment of the trilogy. I know it is sometimes hard to reference all the characters and the historical facts.<br />this was my first kindle book and I dont have the knack for the xray feature and character details but it was a great story but sad for all the loss.
B00863CMZE|5.0|If you love Blackmore's Night, this CD is for you. You get to hear how wonderful the band is live. Candice's beautiful voice is just as fantastic live as in the recording studio. Richie's guitar, just as mesmerizing.<br />I can't wait to someday travel to see this band live and in costume.<br />Love Blackmore's Night!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Lot of fun. Definitelly worth the money. So far number 1 in my book for hidden object games. Great graphics, fun games, well put together.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very fun game for my Kindle Fire! I enjoy Mahjong, whether it's on a board with actual tile, or the computer versions. This game is great to play the story version, or the other 99 individual boards. Very fun and relaxing!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|As a cancer survivor myself, this book was depressing. It had some good moments but was all too real for me.
B004KD5TQI|4.0|I had no idea that Emily Browning was a singer before getting this soundtrack. Her voice is ethereal.<br />The sound track puts you right back in the movie. It's wonderful!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is definitely one of my favorite games. The graphics are great. It's actually like you own a horse. Definitely get this game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is way better than the other one! but I say this is such an awesome app to have.! I play this game more than any other app I have on m  devise.! You have to try it out!! You'll like it!:)
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|its definately a lot better! more graphics and sound effects. you can even swim now! its also a bit more harder but that's what makes it fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good game lots of options I really injoy it a little easy for someone that games a lot though lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is quite like having your own horse, only virtual... it is very cool to play on and it is a great way to pass the time- get this app all you horse lover's!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is a perfect horse app!!!!get it now right now!!!! it is a perfect app for people who like horses!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read a lot of mysteries but this one I felt just wasn't written well. I thought a  lot of things this couple did was unrealistic to rediculous.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This is such clean, good entertainment. Its an English soap opera, but a good English soap opera. Season 2 was not quite as interesting as Season 1. I am looking forward to Season 3.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Was just an all around fun book to read. Rooting for the main character in the real world and inside the OASIS. Had a tough time putting it down, read all the way through. YOU WIN PARZIVAL
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Classic Mark Twain, but illustrations missing.  My first Kindle book and I chose it to experiment with the device as I had read the book before
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i love this game! some people say mean things..but there's always one in every crowd! kinda hard to draw at first but gets easier with practice!
B002SAUCBC|2.0|I am sorry that I bought this book.  As I read it, I looked forward to the end. The story dragged like the plot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game every!!! Similar to the pc,but dosent have all the features. The creator comes out with many updates!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book. hated to put it down.  I highly recommed this book. I was adopted maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.
B0063GORYU|4.0|very good, but some of the automatic moves may not be exactly what you desire. addicting, hard to put down.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I especially like the option of a domino game if you don't want to do the puzzle. An all-around good, challenging game.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the new monkey is too big and blocks your view of what is ahead of you. other than that, it is ok. good graphics.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My daughter and I love it, we didn't want it to end, we can't wait to buy the next season!
0425263916|5.0|LOVED IT!!!  One of my favorites. The next best thing after 50 shades. I have recommended this book to all my friends. I can wait for the last one!!
B000I8ES70|4.0|Very entertaining, good action movie, I like this one alot better than the first , I look forward to the next one, should have  allot more action.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Only complaint...its too short!  Well and its not free like advertised but worth money to play. Would like to see more games like this.
1406333832|5.0|This book is so cute and a favorite of my one year old granddaughter's.  She lives in England so it was a bonus to be able to get it here in America so she would have a familiar book when she visited.  The shipping was surprisingly fast considering it came from the UK.  I'm delighted with my purchase.
B000SJJCX4|3.0|It is definitely worth the money.  I am a semi-professional musician and this pedal has served me well.  I wish it was made of the same high quality casing as my other pedals, but for $20 its worth it and it tunes perfectly and hasn't failed me yet.  Definitely worth it, unless you are looking for a sturdier pedal.
B006645CFM|5.0|You gotta have this if you love the Rolling Stones. Love &#34;Far Away Eyes&#34; and &#34;Miss You.&#34; Bonus tracks are plus for the price.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Coming from a medical family, my father, grandfather and uncle all being physicians, I grew up listening to men who were doubtful there was anything beyond this life.  My father outlived both his father and brother, and gradually came around to believing in an afterlife when he found religion.  However, this physician, Dr. Alexander, actually went through this ordeal and has vivid memories.  I have always believed there is something beyond our earthly life, and this book gives me comfort that my beliefs are valid.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|OK Homey's - I'm a guy....in fact, one who usually loves action movies.  But the Misses pressured me into buying this movie - which I did.  OK, even after it arrived, I was not interested in watchin' it.  After all, it's a woman type of movie, right?<br /><br />Well, guess what - the movie is superb - great actors and great storyline.  Makes you feel good in the end.  Even brought a tear or two to the eye (yup, I'm a retired Marine and I had a tear or two....and it wasn't due to gas or anything like that).<br /><br />So listen up ladies (in my deepest Marine Corps Drill Instructor voice), you need to get this movie and watch it - you'll love it.  And that's an order!!!!!
0375842209|5.0|fabulous book for teens & adults! It took a few pages to figure out the style of the book but absolutely love it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a simple but very user friendly app.  I check it daily in lieu of my home computer to determine my day and upcoming activities on my construction sites
B005USZYDU|5.0|A great story!  Very enjoyable.  Not sure why it received criticism here.  It was classic John Grisham storytelling, minus only a bit of violence and adult themes.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is one of those that a. price is great, b. simple to use, c. need to know some basic calculation formulas if you want something a bit more elaborate with out getting into a scientific calculator.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is so cool and awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think animal lovers would have fun with this game, and everyone else.
B008M87GJK|5.0|As a guy with a foreign born European wife, this app allows me to get a broader view of the world.  This includes occasionally how the rest of the world views the USA
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Although this app was free and it worked, I found it cumbersome. I downloaded another app for AccuWeather and it's much better. For example, when you startup the app, AccuWeather displays current weather information with an hourly forecast. A single swipe bring up the detail for each hour or multi-day forecast.  TWC seemed counterintuitive.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was well written.  Filled with a lot of emotions and suspense.  You could really fill the despair of the parents as they were going through the motions of  trying to prove their only son did not commit this horrible crime. For sure a page turner will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Trailer gives you a peek but its so much better!! Fat Amy is the best!! Nit a chick flick either my hubby and teenage son enjoyed it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a very imaginative and well written story.  It is an easy read that inspires contemplation and reflection.  Strongly recommended.
B0000062S0|4.0|This is one of those tough to gauge albums.  You must listen a bunch of times before you judge fair or foul.  Those of you that didn't like it when it came out in '98, listen again, and maybe you will be more generous this time around. Perhaps not the greatest recording quality compared to the first six Led Zeppelin albums, but that would be almost impossible to replicate anyway.  There are no real memorable songs, but they weave and work well together, and at least you know you're listening to the real duo, albeit significantly past their unprecedented prime.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this a great app but it stopped working as of this morning.  crashes during loading screen.  when it works it's a lot of fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had high expectations for this book, and boy, did it deliver! Jaw-droppingly wonderful! Romantic! Dramatic! And extremely intense! I could barely catch my breath near the end, the surprises kept coming. WOW. That's all I can say! WOW!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Very nice case for my kindle fire HD. It's nice especially if you watch videos because it stands your kindle.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love Bones, and the 7th season was so good! Only thing that surprised me was that it was shorter than the previous seasons. Oh well, still very good!
0393317552|5.0|Wonderful book that outlines some watch-outs for the new America.  This book should be recommended reading for folks that love how history can relate to us today and in the future.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it because you can swing side to side on the rope and you can get on the bucket and ride on the tracks
B008JDAC7G|5.0|the good : this game, my friends, is da BOMB!!! it has excellent graphics, and wonderful animations for the monsters and condos. the Chinese lady is very funny at the beginning. :)<br /> the bad : only four TOTALLY ROCKIN' MONSTERS<br />so that's it. I encourage you to buy this game. worth ninety - nine cents.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I initially joined LinkeIn not knowing what to expect.  The first thing I noticed was a distinct lack of games and the overall professional tone of the site.  LinkedIn is designed as a means for professionals to meet other professionals.  It's a great place to promote your business and to meet others who share your line of work or your interests.  Which leads me to what I have found to be one of LinkedIn's strongest points -Groups (forums).  LinkedIn provides free membership to its Groups, which are wide and varied.  I have personally found them to be extremely helpful.  They provide a great way to get knowledgeable professional input from other LinkedIn members from around the world.  This is invaluable.  The only other comment I have is that they offer four types of membership, Basic (free), Business, Business Plus and Executive.  I have Basic membership, but depending on what your needs are, you may want to upgrade.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is a really good book.  It keeps you interested and it's a good storyline.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Someone told me about this site and I love it.  There are so many excellent ideas for crafts etc.  I have used 3 ideas already for my classroom.  I highly recommend this site.
B001EC3JME|5.0|It was what I was looking for and I use it every day. Also liked that it can be used with more then just a mini-mag.
B004BDDJN2|5.0|really great movie of course any movie with him in it is really really good!!! highly recommend this movie who wants to see a tear jerking movie!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|fantastic movie, I highly rate this as a good watch, a telling tale worthy of a friday night, tub of popcorn and a good red wine.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really hope she writes another book. I really loved this one I will definitely recommend to a friend or two
B0018QCXH8|5.0|fantastic movie, I highly rate this as a good watch, a telling tale worthy of a friday night, tub of popcorn and a good red wine.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The entire album is great.  Not just the hit songs that you hear on the radio, but the entire album is great.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|fantastic movie, I highly rate this as a good watch, a telling tale worthy of a friday night, tub of popcorn and a good red wine.
078322740X|5.0|Love Steve Martin and Love Goldie Hawn......great movie and great story.....one of the funniest we've seen in a long time......product arrived early and in great condition .....
B0059GVBHG|4.0|a very dark and  upsetting story but very real. very hard to watch but hard not to watch it. check it out for yourself.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Every other time I use gems at all the game crashes and when you boot back up they're still gone with all progress cleared.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I purchased the game for my Kindle Fire because it was inexpensive.  It's a very simple game for someone who enjoys playing games on a handheld pad.<br /><br />It's OK but I wouldn't recommend it except for a child who spends a lot of time with a pad.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Too much emphasis on talking tough and gore.  Also, the main character growls when he talks.  All killing, no story.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game and addictive. You do run out of coins rather fast at times. Needs a little more variety.<br /><br />Nice way to kill time and kids enjoy it too.<br /><br />EDIT: knocked this down to four stars. Eventually the area where you move through the fair to access other games and get new prizes stops and you can't advance anymore or get addition puzzle pieces. It becomes boring then.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been playing it non stop for 3 days. It is a great way to make time fly. I recommend this game to everyone!
B002FL3JA0|3.0|It falls apart very easly but other than that its good.  I just wish it was more durable for every day use
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the series and hope there will be more. So refreshing to read something so real and untainted. All couples should read.
B004SBX112|3.0|Really like this ap to just relax at times.  Very good for the motor and thinking skills as well.  Would recommend
034580404X|5.0|This was a christmas gift for my wife and she read all of them in a week, so I think she likes them. Thanks.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Like this game to unwind at night after a long day.  Provides motor and memory skills and is enjoyable.  Get the piggies!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great movie for kids and parents to enjoy together!  Very colorful, detailed animation, and full of great music.  A must see.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another well written book.  I really enjoyed the ups and downs and twists and turns this book provided.  Being a historical romamce reader this book really caught my attention.  THanks
B003P2WO5E|5.0|It's just an amazing book. Go read it and hope he writes faster than Martin.  And I need five more words.
B007C7UZIG|3.0|This app is nice as it allows you to talk to Steam friends on your Kindle. However, it could use more features that Steam offers, such as being able to view/purchase from the Steam store.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. It also gave me two bad dreams in a row.  I was little let down by the ending.  Amy should not win in the end and I think she does.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Good game. freezes some times but I still play it and it's easy to play all the the time great
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Outstanding read. The premise is realistic and the story moves right along. I really couldn't put it down. One of the better syfi books I've read.
B008MM9630|4.0|You better watch that wallet of yours! I've only had this app for two minutes and already know that my wallet is in danger! But otherwise it's pretty fun. It started to get a little boring.
B009CGGCSC|5.0|Great songs,I  love Abba.  I could watch this over and over again.  The acting is good but some of the story lines are lacking a little.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|This is fits very nicely.  I absolutely love the rotation of the screen.and the hand &#34;band&#34;.  The color is vibrant and it is nice to know my kindle is protected if I happen to drop it.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|A different perspective. I liked the way it highlighted the differences between faith and science, and the similarities too. Good movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The characters were engaging. A most unusual story, thought provoking and a must read.
B001NLKXK2|3.0|It was a pretty good book, but as it is about alzheimers it is also depressing. I liked the way it was written and if you are experiencing a loved one with this then it is a great book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved the entire series. Have recomended this to several friends.Will purchase additional products from Amazon.Thank you for helping me to download the series
B00846REIS|5.0|Very hot and steamy book and an interesting story. It is not for the more inhibited individual. It is also a quick read. This is the first in a series called Crossfire.
B007SNMYNS|5.0|I would recommend everybody read this book, it will open your eyes. I went wheat free and feel like a whole new person.
B0088O11NU|3.0|It's fun for maybe about 45 minutes than it gets boring.  The calibration for levelling doesn't work to well either.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome it has a lot of options for runners game has great graphics and it is full of suspense and fun times
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|Very good movie for everyone.  Purchased the movie for my Amazone Collection and will watch again.  If you haven't seen it watch it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|then why not buy this one? it is rated as the only book on Mark Zuckerbergs facebook profile except for Plato. I can see why...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The Battery app works very well on the Kindle Fire HD.<br />Park the app on the carousel and receive information on remaining power very quickly..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a very good book. It had many interesting twists that were totally unpredictable. I highly recommend reading it. It is love story, but not your average love story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app because it feels like you own a horse it love and to care for. it is so much fun to feel like you have a horse
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool and fun buy it although something happened and I wasn't able to name the horse so apperantley its called beauty
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I expected a lot better but the story was slow. It got better towards the end but by then it was too late. Disappointing.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I will start with the pros in that these headphones have an above average sound quality to them. They do tend to pop and crackle with the lows, most times when there are explosions or anything of that nature in a game. I had some issue with them connecting when I had the transmitter somewhat close to my XBOX. I use my wifi to connect to LIVE, so I am assuming that was the problem. I had to have the transmitter on the floor, away from the console when I played and never really had the problem again. The real downside to these headphones is the physical quality compared to price. For $150+ I would expect a product to be made up of quality parts built in a way that will substantially stand up to normal wear and tear. I have had to glue mine back together on numerous occasions because of how cheaply put together the plastic construction is, and most recently they finally just couldn't be salvaged with the right ear piece snapping right off in my hand while merely taking them off of my head int he middle of a game. Do yourself a favor and either go for something less expensive or a different brand, because these would be MAYBE worth  $50.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the game and the graphics<br />but it's overly glitchy and freezes up and causes me to not be able to turn or slide etc.<br />also while I like this whole levels thing I do not like that I cannot get whatever achievements I want but rather have to do them in a specific order. I got to 500,000 points out of sheer luck and it passed one achievement but the next I got was get 500,000 points and I've played 20 or so more times since then and can't get back to that so I'm stuck on my current level because I can't pass any other objectives and it's very frustrating.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|bought this for my daughter for christmas. She read all the books and we saw all the movies in the theater. By far the best series she and I have read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved loved loved this book can't wait to read number 2 if you loved fifty shades of gray you will love this book
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an amazing read. It is unique and interesting and it makes the reader feel special to be in Charlie's confidence. It is a story worthy of re-reading.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't understand why this game is as popular as it is. I found it silly and boring. what is all the hype about?
B001HN6EF4|5.0|These are the best cards I've ever owned, UNO or otherwise. They shuffle really easy. The best attribute I think they have is how easily they can be cleaned. I am a Middle School Special Ed teacher & I have a 7 year old daughter. I bought a set for my classroom & my house. Between my Special Ed students & my daughter there tends to be a lot of messes. The cards clean up easy with a warm soapy sponge. The only negative thing is the clip the cards come with is really stiff & hard to get the cards on & off.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I highly recommend it.  one of the best  cds of all time.  you can't go wrong with this purchase.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You got to download this temple run 2 it's the most highly visual flawless game. It works on any kind of tablet you have. It has New features and it way better then the original
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I returned the leather cases.  I thought they were ugly.  I only meant to buy one in the first place.  I am waiting to have my returned acknowledged.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun and exciting you would never get tired of this game so if i was you i would get this game it is freaking awesome!!!!!!!
B004D9FLJE|5.0|What can one say?  If you love GLEE you'll love these DVDs.  I often put one in -- pick an episode that appeals to me and exercise whilst watching/listening to it.  Much better than a Wii game or whatever.  I know WHAT to do (use my step, weights, rope, fitness ball, exercise bike...) I just don't -- but using GLEE as a motivator helps.  Sometimes the episode ends and I am shocked that I've done my fitness without even realizing it.
B008FTAAG2|2.0|After hearing the song  Blood,which was an amazing piece of work,  I was excited to hear the rest of the album. I can see why Blood was chosen as a single as its the best song of the album.  I was expecting more of the same slow dark lyrics mixed with screams and was hit with Slow mellow songs again and again.
B0033H7VI6|3.0|When my knife arrived the first thing I noticed is a couple of large dings in the spine of the knife.  The next thing I noticed is the tip of the knife is cut completely off center making the knife look like its not streight! Not just a little, but very noticable!  That says to me that the quality control at Schrade is total crap.  I know the knife is inexpensive, but it shoud at least be streight!  I know I read one other review that said he had the same problem.  That said, I really like the knife design and the weigh is great in your hand.  The sheath will hold a full size SOG power lock multitool perfectly and I have put my Streamlight protac in the straps that hold the smaller pouch to the main sheath, and to me thats a pretty good system ready to go.  If yours is crooked I would like to know.  If this is not a common error I will gladly return mine for a replacement.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a sequel to the first temple run, just like they said, beautiful graphics and lots of new obstacles which makes this game outstanding! If you like to play fast paced games with the edge of your seat feeling this game is a must download.  You definitely won't regret getting this game!
0765325950|4.0|I'm not one of the WoT fans who followed the book for decades. I am an avid fantasy reader and I have known of the series but to start on something which is so complex and convoluted with plot twist and a cast of thousands with no end in sight, became just too torturous. When I heard the news that Brandon Sanderson using Robert Jordon's notes will finally finished the book, I timed it so that I would be continuously reading the series right to the end. After reading book 11, Jordon's final book, I still don't understand how he expected to finish the whole series in book 12, he was still introducing new characters and plots for another 7 books.<br /><br />I thought that Sanderson did a great job and maybe he did himself an injustice by not extending on the book. I agree with many reviewers that the finality of core characters was somewhat brief, for fans who have followed these characters for decades, the closure was metaphorically flushing your goldfish down the toilet, it would have been more gratifying to give the readers time to mourn. The battle scenes were repetitious and sometimes a little childish but seriously could it have ended any other way? There were endless evil characters to dispose.<br /><br />I often get disappointed in many fantasy epics where the dark one meets their fate and bang 20 pages later, everyone is loving life and the everything is finished. It would have a truer conclusion if we had 200 to 300 hundred pages of a meaning end with the lives of the main characters and kingdoms 100 years in the future. We suffered through thousands of pages of the latest WoT fashion described in minute details, it would have been wonderful to see the conclusion of the character's lives as in the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />3 stars was for \\"my god its finished\\", 1 star was for Brandon Sanderson awesome performance and I would have given another star if it end in a cliff hanger for book 15.
0553378384|1.0|Astrology for the Soul. Sounds great right? Your soul incarnates here at a time point (birthday) and you go around reading your horoscope for your birthday until you feel a need for more.....<br /><br />This book is based on the soul being aligned with the north node through the 12 signs. It then gives a whole lot of information about the North node in a sign as well as the South node (the negative energies to the sign that you don't want to follow and you want to correct).<br /><br />According to the sign the north node is in, this is your soul's karmic pathway. That's all this book is about ok? North node in Aries means your soul has this karmic pathway so concentrate more on X,Y,Z and you'll feel happier (south node will be in opposite sign of Libra and those tendencies will manifest a certain way which you want to watch out for). North node in Sagittarius? Your karmic pathway is A,B,C and if you follow the steps, you'll feel more fulfilled. Everyone likes things to do to fulfill their life according to the metaphysical or you wouldn't have picked up the book (and I wouldn't have bought it) so I was all set to start action on my pathway. Would be great in practice but.......<br /><br />Big problem: The website they tell you to go to get your chart done and find your north node is WRONG. Let me explain. There are at least (at the time of this writing) 5 major software programs for astrology (and that's normal astrology, not Vedic, Horary, Egyptian, Hellenic, get the point?) and within those astrology programs are fun things to do like figure out if you WANT your birth chart to be based on Standard Time or Daylight Savings Time (there's an argument in the astrology community over this so if you go to one astrologer they might do your birthday w/standard and another might go with DST).<br /><br />What does this mean for YOU and this 1 note wonder of a book? if you went to the astrologer who did your chart with DST your northnode might end up in Leo. Yeah, you've got your Soul's karmic answer right? Wrong. You go to the astrologer who does your chart in Standard time and your North Node suddenly gets thrown in Virgo or Cancer. Now what? Your soul suddenly has 2 karmic paths? It gets better........this is based on Placidius software but what if the astrologer is using a program that is using Koch algorithms? Well then let's just say you might have a 3rd North node option and you're wiser to ignore this whole junk book because it was never meant to give you your &#34;soul's&#34; karmic path but to energize you into doing something if you feel yourself in a rut.<br /><br />****The website they point you to is running a software program to generate your chart and I have no idea if its giving you good information. From having my own chart done by a professional, I know the North node the website gave me was off by 2 signs from the one the professional gave me so I'll leave you with that thought as well.<br /><br />Now that you've read this, go read the 5 star ratings but keep this one in mind. Thank you.your Soul's karmic answer right? Wrong. You go to the astrologer who does your chart in Standard time and your North Node suddenly gets thrown in Virgo or Cancer. Now what?

1439199388|5.0|If you have allergies or an auto-immune disease, or know someone who does, then this book is for you. What seemed a disparate and arbitrary array of maladies (everything from hay fever to autism) was expertly put into a schema based on the latest studies and peer-reviewed research going on all over the world. Author Moises Velasquez-Manoff does a masterly job of being enthusiastic while remaining cautious in his approach. There is so much doctors and scientists still do not know, and yet his book reports what to my mind are some very exciting breakthroughs in understanding the mechanisms of allergies and autoimmune disease.<br /><br />Velasquez-Manoff is an excellent writer, an intrepid journalist not above jumping into the fray (spoiler alert: he infects himself with a parasite!), and a good guide through some pretty complicated territory. Buy the book and then sign up on his website for updates.
B000SW2F8K|5.0|I didn't expect much when I began watching this movie, and ended up totally in love with every single second! Visually it's very beautiful: the scenery, the colors, the artwork. Yes, each character is over-the-top: the VERY beautiful/sexy Isabella, the VERY handsome/sexy husband, the VERY eccentric/flamboyant Monica, the VERY nice-guy producer what's-his-name... and the towns of Bahia and San Franciso are so lovingly, colorfully filmed. It was like a dream you might have, with a lovely happy ending. Bravo!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What more could one ask, in this age of hollywood throwing the pretty people on screen without any acting ability, and a cliched story line. Could go into more detail on some parts, but probably good this way also, since it makes a quick resolution of &#34;problems.&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|gorgeous set, amazing era, great acting, terrific production, looking forward to another season of this series bring on season 3
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|Not my cup of tea. It's a bit on the graphic side, and I just couldn't get into the story line.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a great app for kids or adults. Easy to follow and addicting! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun game.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is like a bloody and F-Bomb filled version of Van Helsing. In this case, that is a good thing. Van Helsing was pretty bad, but they pushed this one far enough with the R rating to please the horror fan inside me. The witches look nice and creepy and most of the CGI is well done. Jeremy Renner (Hansel) is a fantastic actor, though he is mostly wasted here and Gemma Arterton (Gretel) is more of the focus based on her looks and her character's personality. Famke Janssen has fun with the lead evil witch role. This film barely runs 90 minutes and it is light on story and high on action, but I had a good time watching it. Worth a future rental if you don't mind turning your brain off and just enjoy the fact that it is not as bad as you feared it would be.<br /><br />Oh, the IMAX 3-D was better done than most non-blockbuster type action films.<br /><br />Edit (7/6/13): I had to knock it up a star after watching the Unrated Cut. Still a very fun movie upon second viewing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is.like owning your own horse. you can feed it groom it enter your horse in compitions clothe it train it pick up after it. also you can name it however you want. if you want more than one horse you can u se your gems and coins.

B009XTF8JM|5.0|It's a very good movie. It has similar qualities to other posession movies but it's also very different and unique at the same time. I's reccomend this movie to anyone!
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book for my 20 month old granddaughter but it was my 4 year old grandson who ended up having me read it to him over and over.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I've loved horror movies and watched loads of them since I was a teenager.  After 30 odd years, you get pretty used to all the usual scare tactics and it takes a lot to really make you cringe.  I have to say that Sinister had me cringing, biting my nails and even covering my eyes in some parts.  It was original, unexpected for the most part and definitely creepy and frightening.  Ethan Hawke  gives an amazing performance as a true crime writer who finds a box of old home movies and stumbles upon a string of murders of whole families. The murders all happen in the most gruesome ways and are all recorded on super 8 film.  This is not a slasher movie.  The film of the actual murders all cut away at exactly the moment when it became gruesome but enough is shown to give you a clear idea of what is happening and honestly the imagined horror is, I think, worse, than seeing the blood and hearing the screams.  The only point where I think this movie didn't excel was toward the end.  It reverted to cheap and easy \\"jump out of the shadows\\" kind of scares rather than continuing with the creeping terror of the rest of the movie. That was only for about the last 15-20 minutes, though.<br />One scene in particular stands out to me.  It is when Ethan Hawke's character hears noises from the attic in the middle of the night and goes up to investigate.  I think I held my breath through the whole scene.<br />If you're up for a good scare, this is definitely worth your time.  I would caution against kids younger than 12 or 13 watching it, however, due to the subject matter and intensity of the film.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|my wife and just finished watching and the first thing i did was send my son, a musician, an email that he should see this film. the story is amazing, a detective story that turns into what would be a fairy tale if it weren't true.  it's remarkable and moving, and the music is the icing on the cake.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the first temple run and then my brother got temple run 2 for his ipod touch. So I couldn't wait for it to come out for the kindle and now I cant stop playing it :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful story, I laughed & cried, sometimes on the same page. Start this book early in the day because you won't want to put it down.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The graphics on temple run 2 are awesome. However, I don't like it when you get to the parts where you are running at the far edge of one side on a narrow strip of brick. I always stumble and get caught/eaten by the gorilla thing... But it's absolutely worth it to download this game. It may take a second to start up, but so did the first one, so don't get frustrated if it doesn't start up immediately.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Game is lame and won't open. Definitely do not like it at all!!!! Sorry for the ones who love it- I am not one of them...
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I loved the creative solutions that the main character uses to use what he has on hand.  It was very believable and @ the same time you are amazed with the solution.  Yes it's a little potty mouth but @ the same time it helps you related to the character.  Definitely worth a read :-)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved the game I wish there were more mines. I also think that there is a lot of ducking. more characters would be nice. overall I still love the game
0812979656|5.0|This is one of the most incredible books I have ever read--actually I should say that I have ever experienced.  It is an experience.  Brilliant, moving, powerful.  Her use of language, her metaphors are amazing.  The story is heart-rending.  There is a lot to learn here too about people and cultures and tolerance (and lack of).  One reviewer called this astounding.  I agree.

B003IY49S4|4.0|As a long time collector of a variety of genres, including many albums from various stages and movements within Jazz, this release caught my attention.  The value of the set is undeniable whether this is your first exposure to Jazz music(s), or if you're like me, an attempt to fill some gaps in an otherwise developed collection.  Sound quality and original jacket reproductions are well executed, and at $2.00 per CD you'd be hard pressed to find music this great for this cheap anywhere (excluding illegal means of course).<br /><br />All of that said, if this is indeed your first foray into Jazz, a word of caution:<br /><br />There are some certifiable classic albums in this set, and some very good ones besides.  There are also some peculiar selections whose priority in this set is questionable at best, but understanding the way this was compiled helps to clarify.  These are all Columbia and RCA/Victor recordings, so this is their definition of Perfect.  It is also limited to the artists who they actually managed to record and secure the rights to.  This ensures that the survey of Jazz presented completely omits free jazz and some of the less commercially oriented or mainstream Jazz, not to mention some key figures in the movements that are indeed represented here.  While this stuff is subjective, I would argue that no \\"perfect\\" Jazz collection can get away with omitting Ben Webster, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Clifford Brown, Eric Dolphy, John Coltrane (though he is on Kind of Blue), and Ornette Coleman.  Mine would also extend to include Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Cecil Taylor, Roland Kirk, Andrew Hill, Jackie Maclean and many more besides (The three disc \\"[[ASIN:B00004SG7T Wildflowers: New York Loft Jazz Sessions Complete]]\\" set beautifully represents a time and scene completely neglected here, the New York loft scene in the 1970's).  More broadly, any solid overview of Jazz history cannot omit the contributions of a variety of record labels such as Impulse, Blue Note, Verve, and Atlantic.<br /><br />Certain album choices for this set seem strange as well, but make more sense when one realizes the limited range of material Columbia has to choose from.  I found the choice of material from Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and especially Charlie Parker to be very mediocre to poor representations of their actual talent and body of work.  The Frankenstein project that the was the \\"Bird\\" motion picture soundtrack is an egregious first exposure to Parker, and he is served infinitely better by the \\"[[ASIN:B00006H6A6 The Complete Savoy & Dial Master Takes]]\\".<br /><br />The bottom line here folks is that while this is a great bargain and a buy I don't regret, to these ears it's far from perfect.  Don't let your only version of Jazz history be the one Columbia dictates, and think of this as a decent but flawed survey with some essential material to get your collection started.

B003NFM3JU|5.0|Jim Carrey does a good job on this, and movie itself is very well done. This was one of the first 3D movies I've watched in a movie theater and was very impressed. When I finally bought a 3D TV (LG & review is here somewhere) and 3D Blu-ray player (Panasonic and review is also here somewhere), this was the first 3D movie I bought. Played it on Christmas Eve along with a couple of other movies and really enjoyed it..  well worth buying
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|This stopped working after several games and I had to remove it.  The first few games I played were great but when it stopped it stopped and nothing I tried would fix it.  I purchased and different app that I'm not as happy with because of the way it plays but it does work.  If they would get the bugs out of this I would like to have it back.  I think the app should have been removed until the bugs are corrected to prevent people from getting something that doesn't work or quits.  That way when it is re listed we would know it is fixed, otherwise I'm afraid to try it again.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This was well worth buying.. the story itself is very good, and seeing in 3D made it even better. We watched this on Christmas Eve along with A Christmas Carol in 3D with Jim Carrey and enjoyed them both...  would not hesitate to buy again
B008JFUTT0|4.0|I'm giving this documentary 4-stars mainly because it's a rather uplifting true story.  As for the music itself, it is rather obvious that most reviewers here have exaggerated how good it is.  Rodriguez had a few decent songs, but nothing special, as most of these reviewers would have you believe.  His 2 original albums bombed in the U.S. for a very good reason - there's nothing special or extraordinary about them.  The comparisons of his writing to that of Bob Dylan makes me want to puke.  There were so many great artists in 1970 and by comparison, Rodriguez simply was not that good.  He isn't the first artist to have a couple of albums bomb and see their short-lived career in music end and he certainly will not be the last.  The story is uplifting and only brought to light because of his popularity in South Africa.  Otherwise, he would still remain unknown in the U.S., just like hundreds of other artists whose work went unnoticed.  Other than that, there is nothing special about the music itself.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the game but sometimes when I jump across the bridge I go through it and die and it took away 3 of my gems whenn I didn't do anything that cost gems
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So excited to see a new Temple Run, I installed it immediately. My excitement was short lived because the game doesn't register the swipes. I'm a long time TR player so I know how to swipe, but this game is almost impossible to master. Fix this issue and I'll give it five stars.<br /><br />Update- Whatever the problem was with the swipes has disappeared. I love this game and can't play it enough. It now gets 5 stars.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|I love this show, it was recommended to me by a friend so I purchased the 1st and 2nd seasons, I'm almost done, it is a fabulous crazy show, but the acting is top notch, it keeps your interests.<br /><br />UPDATE, I'm now watching Season Three, I also purchased Season FOUR, I am definately hooked on this bizarre show.  I LOVE IT, the acting is fabulous and so are the characters.
1250007208|5.0|Cinder, the futuristic mechanic sells wares and fixes stuff on the streets of New Beijing.  She gets an unexpected visitor, the Prince.<br /><br />*THE GREATS*<br /><br />- The protagonist as a cyborg. Cinder is a very special one-of-a-kind cyborg with a mysterious maker.  It works.  It keeps the reader engaged as we discover together with Cinder of what else her cyborg system is capable of. I loved reading about the info-feed updating the bottom of her vision.  The lie-detecter is a fantastic added feature.  It is fun, well done and very, very cool.<br /><br />- The pace.  The book cracks on.<br /><br />- The Sci-fi is strong.  The world fits together well, New Beijing makes sense, and the Lunars are interesting.<br /><br />- Great ending!  It sets up the world well for the sequel.<br /><br />*NOT SO GREATS*<br /><br />- Cyborgs. In the book a cyborg is someone that has a synthetic arm leg/hand - not a fully fledged AI. In this world humans detest cyborgs with a passion.... why? An explaination likely ended up on the editing room floor.  Would we hate cyborgs?  So a loved one with a replacement leg is now a cyborg detested by society?<br /><br />All round a great book that I would certainly recommend.e some plot flags that are announced like a battering ram to the head and some weaknesses surrounding disease control.<br /><br />Altogether all is forgiven for this is a book for KIDS!<br /><br />I am going to give this to my boss' daughter, and I bet her review will be the full 5 stars.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|I'm on the 2nd season, almost done.  This is a very bizarre show but it keeps me entertained.  I dont want to really get into the story because I dont want to spoil it.  It falls into the same category as &#34;Dexter&#34;, &#34;SIX feet under&#34;.  Excellent acting, funny realistic characters.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Slow movind plot.  Seems like writer drew out the movie too long then jammed in the very predictable ending.  Not the worst but definitely not the best for either main character.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It is awesome when I looked behind me I saw slender man with these freaky spider arms out of his back
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good job to developer. Looks and works perfectly. Recommend to everyone.Good for people on the road or just looking for something different
0439023513|1.0|To start, I enjoyed the first two books. I won't spend more time than I must on this review, and you shouldn't waste your time like I did reading the third book. I'm not sure what part I enjoyed more, the one where the rebel military was unable to repel an attack, yet Katniss and Gale had no problem shooting down hovercrafts with arrows; or the ending where Prim died and I laughed heartily outloud because I no longer cared about any character in the book. In short, don't read.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved the book it is much better than the moive<br />I really  suggest reading it<br />Good for every one
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Wow!!! Good music puts you into a good mood. Well worth it best album I have purchased in years. And great price as well
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is quite entertaining with good graphics. the lady in the glasses is sexy. I'd like to see her more involved as a reward.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have to say, In the past month I have read 7 books. Most of them teen novels. This was the most epic book i have ever read. I finished it one day could not put it down. I thought I would have a hard time going from paranormal to what his books holds. Instead I was swept away by everything. I can't wait until april when her second book comes out in this series. It is from the view of Travis. I wish she would continue the story thought. She left it finished and giving you the perfect ending but still I know she is a writing genius and I wish she would come up with a second book for it. on her site she days she going to be writing more in the series but from the brothers views. I hoop I will be able to get into them like I did this one. I know I will love the retelling of from the male leads view but still I want more of their story I can't get enough!!! I saw this book today in the bookstore and went home to try an sample and found out I could not put it done. I am glad I bought it! these are the kind of books I look forward to. She is epic and I really hope she writes about their story again.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Why does the villain sound like Goldmember from the Austin Powers movies? That's not even close to cool. How could they even consider putting that moron in the next movie after Heath Ledger's disturbed performance in The Dark Knight?<br /><br />This movie was boring. It had senseless action. It somehow forgot that the rest of the Earth outside NYC might actually help in a situation like this. I mean...  Whatever. Maybe I'm not as whimsical (maybe that's not the word) as necessary to like when trash like this is shoved down my throat.<br /><br />Save your time, go outside.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the game  but it is choppy and lags, which makes it hard to play. If it didn't lag than I would have given it 5 stars.
B002LANLDK|1.0|That's the best effort they could make?<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is Jordana Brewster and that's all I'll say about that.<br /><br />That GPS thing was hilarious too.
B0089XH38M|1.0|This app not supported by Kindle Fire - very disappointing and the same is true for the Zinio App!!! :-(
B002JVWR9U|5.0|If you're a fan of the show or like vampires pick up a copy.  Looking for a show in between something like TrueBlood & Twilight check this one out, won't disappoint.  Best thing about this show it's on basic tv so it's free to watch.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn's highly acclaimed novel starts out great, takes a wicked twist in act two, and fizzles to a wan landing in act three.
B003L77GH4|5.0|If you're a fan of the show or like vampires pick up a copy.  Looking for a show in between something like TrueBlood & Twilight check this one out, won't disappoint.  Best thing about this show it's on basic tv so it's free to watch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Landay has leveraged his expertise into a well written and heart wrenching novel.  It is the story of every parent's nightmare, a child who may be a murderer.  The novel explores the emotions of the participants with insight equal to that given to the technical aspects of a murder investigation and trial.  He makes the point that the accused innocent suffer as much as victims or perpetrators, maybe more so in view of their innocence.  It should be of no surprise to any potential reader, however, that the subject manner does not itself to a light-hearted conclusion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i would totally recomend this for anyone that loves animals. i like it my son and daughter  like it and i really love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game will free you of any sign of bordom! it is a mix of adventure and exitement! the things technology can do!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is incredible.  I've gone from 190 pounds to 155 pounds in 9 months.<br /><br />The point is this: wheat in 50 years has been engineered to increase yields 10 times per acre, at the expense of the human body.<br /><br />The proof is in the pudding.<br /><br />Thank you Dr. Davis!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really enjoy the series.  Bummed that it will not allow me to stream via HDMI cord to my TV so I can watch it on a bigger screen.  Maybe better to buy the series on DvD's!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Action-packed, hair-raising, great movie!  Can't wait to see the sequel.
1400067820|5.0|One of the best books in the last 20 years,  Cuts through all the rhetoric of Fox News and rupert murdoch
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|HAVE SEEN BOTH SEASONS 1 & 2, BOTH OF WHICH WERE SPELLBINDING & TERRIFIC. SEASON 3 SHOULD BE LIKEWISE; CANNOT WAIT TO SEE IT AFTER SEEING THE PREVIEW.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is a fun show,  I love the way they have taken the fairy tales we know and twisted them just a little.  The real life town of storybrook is filled with new stories just waiting to be written.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is ELF, for goodness sake - why do you need MY review?! Funny, touching, silly and perfect for a Christmas tradition!
B005LAII8A|5.0|this movie was very good.  it defintely stood up with its name.  it is one of those movies that you have to pay attention.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am so confused as to why people liked this book? The ending was awful. I just felt like the characters at the end of the book you could of cared less about it. I just wanted the book to be over!
B0062P3392|5.0|this movie combines mystery and drama.  i really enjoyed this movie.  it was very exciting and kept you engrossed in the movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved this book! I was so tired of bad books that I was put off from reading for months!!! Then I read the reviews and was tempted ... It was amazing. You will not regret reading this book.
B009POCG2C|5.0|this movie turned out better than i thought it would.  clint eastwood hit it out of the park again.  he played his roll in the movie like he really did have a sight problem
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This book was viscerally disturbing.  The horror of living in USSR is not to be believed.  The characters were flawed but a product of the times.  The protagonist risked all to find the killer even though nobody wanted to know or care.  I would like to read subsequent books from this series
B008KEQMDC|4.0|this movie was hilarious.  a really good comedy about pregnancy.  has a great cast and definitely keeps you laughing.  would definitely recommend it
B007M45PMU|5.0|Love this album. The sound is amazing and fresh. The whole album is good, not just a couple songs. It's deff worth listening to!
B005LAII12|4.0|this movie was quite hilarious. it is a good movie to watch when you want a good comedy.  i would definitely recommend it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game but you need a lot of coins and gems to enjoy it. you start off with a horse and you earn money buy feeding it and caring for it. if you want another horse it costs alot off money. you need energy to earn money working. I love this bane but that is why I ratedbthis game only 4 stars.
1934030198|5.0|I read this book cover to cover after it came from Amazon.  Joe breaks down information into coherent, simple sections that can apply to anyone's training regimen.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a gripping drama. Very well written and actors are superb. I just started watching season one and am addicted already. I don't want to stop watching...I am obsessed with this show!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. The horses look very real. The game is pretty easy for my kids to be able to play it. My kids love it! It really helps pass the time.
0765325950|5.0|Absolutely amazing book and a great ending to the series. But like all great endings, it pulls at you to want more. There are still so many stories that haven't been completed and I am just dying for more to read. BUT it is truly a very great book and a must read.
0783229526|5.0|No scratches got here on time.. I love this movie one of my favorites of all time, some may not get it at first you have to watch it a couple of times. Johnny Depp Portrays Hunter S. Thompson perfectly.. &#34;You see what god just did to us man?,&#34; &#34;God didn't do that your a f'n narcotics agent I knew it&#34;
B0094BB4TW|4.0|does not do as much as my app on my phone, but it's ok. maybe the next update will do more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book was so funny and so sad and so beautiful, i read it in one day, i could not put it down.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|It is all here, the beauty of the music, the passion of the play, and the very well performed musical. The actors are not known to be singers, but to me, an untrained appreciator of music. I do not need the best, highly trained voice, but this is sung with an energy that surpasses a trained singer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a fun game with lots of things to do.  It has very nice graphics and details.  If you enjoy horse games then you should try my horse.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|2 words 2 describe Magic Mike,SIZZLING SEXY!!!.I've seen it @ the movies b4 4th of july last year & I just can't get enough of Channing Tatum's Sexiness when he did the stripper moves.Alex PettyFer on the other hand was Soooo H-O-T as adam aka the kid & I &lt;3 him in a heartbeat.Good thing I got the dvd so I can watch it whenever I feel like it
B0094KTBT8|1.0|This is the second rental from amazon and both were major disappointments.  The movie kept stopping waiting for the network to download the movie.  I have netflix and never experience this problem with them.  I rented breaking bad from amazon and the same thing happened.  It was so  bad the amazon techs could not get the last episode of breaking bad to ever download. I have yet to see it.<br /><br />Not very happy with movie rentals from amazon.  I have amazon prime and considering canceling because you cannot use all the entitlements that are suppose to come with it.<br /><br />Ron Brown<br />rbrown9999@msn.com
B007HACDLK|4.0|Still ove Vince Flynn but I had higher hopes for this book.  I still wait for his next one.  His older books kept me very entertained.
1433207044|5.0|I heard Mark Cuban recommend this...so I expected it to be great, and I wasn't disappointed. The audio version is extremely well read and expressed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have been reading some other books dealing with NDE's and this was one of the best I have read.  Having worked in the Medical field for 45 years the medical terminology used by Dr Alexander in his book was easily understood.<br />Thank you Dr Alexander for writing this book, maybe it will convince some of the skeptic professionals that there is more to life than just this one here on earth.<br />God bless you always.
B00000K3D4|2.0|i know lots of people who love this movie..but i am sorry to say, i am not one of them.effects,etc.are great.
0399246665|3.0|Good books, but a little difficult for small children because of the half-pages. The pictures are colorful and the choice of vocabulary is nice, all in Eric Carle's style. Better for 2-3 year olds.
B0057AOS3I|5.0|I love this album. There's really not much else to say about this album. Beyonce never ceases to amaze me with her music.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This product is very good, and it is what I like to buy it,  and it is a very good deal!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really like playing majong and this was a very good game to while away the hours. I would recommend this to anyone who likes majong.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This horse I'm working with its fun because you get to see what some horses go through everyday.it's also fun to train and to compete against other horses
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good game to play while waiting for an appt. or while waiting for someone.I would recommend this to anyone that likes solitaire.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely beautiful story of finding yourself and dealing with the normal and some not so normal situations you're put into growing up. Easy to read, and seems very personal because of the diary writing approach the author took.
B0058YPL66|4.0|The item was delivered within the estimated time. It was in perfect condition and looked like it was barely used. It even included the original ads and packaging. I am very pleased with my DVDs and have been watching them ever since I received them. Thank you.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game for wasting time I recommend it for kids age six and up. it's worth the cost you should get it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|easy to identify how much life left for different tasks. Simple to understand. Does what you would expect from a battery app .haven't seen better.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great. The app updates regularly and is easy to use. I like the extended forecast section, it is for15days and is pretty accurate. The radar map is animated and is very detailed. You can also save multiple locations so you can check the weather at your dream vacation location as well as your home town. I have 2 additional locations saved so I can check Florida and Hawaii forecasts when it is freezing cold up here in the northern United States. Would recommend this app for anybody who is looking for a weather app.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Awesome book! I just love Ellen!! The book is hilarious and a very easy read! I totally recommend this book!
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|Live this app makes my job alot easier while being on the go around the city and state and abroad
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Clearly states that you can purchase items in game. So what its free. Desc says you can buy inngame stuff.
0399160450|4.0|Threat Vector feels like classic Clancy. The last couple of books haven't wowed me but Threat Vector was well paced, even for 800+ pages. The build up was about 600 pages with 200 or so for the ending. This is much better than previous books which have rushed the end. Is it my favorite of all time? No. But it is a great addition to Clancy's work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the book....I wanted katniss to be with gale but after I thought of it I'm happy that katniss is with peeta and there two children =)
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I saw this movie when it originally came out, on a super wide screen.  What a thrilling experience.  The newly remastered version on blue-ray is tremendous.  Great color, excellent sound score.  This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves a place in one's collection.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Neat little app tool to help analyze wireless signals.  Responds fairly quickly (not instantaneously) to signal strength, and use to help determine best positioning for wireless router, and where strongest signal is in house.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|i love this app!  hard to believe this isa free app too. ads are present but not annoying. many fun and challenging levels to play. veryeasy to download and use. highly recommended for novice and expert alike. i am considering buying the paid edition!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This season and season 1 are my two favorites, but every season is awesome.  Secret Santa is a great keeper to watch on Christmas.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Without giving away Spoilers, it was great to see the origin of the \\"M\\", \\"Q\\" and \\"Moneypenny\\" Characters we have come to know in all the rest of the Bond movies. Although a 3 Movie Prequal seems like a cash grab, it actually makes the previous Bond Movies more enjoyable with the Back story provided.
B00786XVOG|4.0|A good DVD of his live concert, but I liked the &#34;Voices&#34; DVD from 2009 better as it had a larger orchestra, featuring Ann Marie Calhoun (born Simpson).  She is the older sister of the featured violinist Mary Simpson on this DVD, by the way.  Also, Voices featured twice the number of songs - 22  as opposed to the 11 on this DVD, plus several encore performances.<br /><br />.
B00005JNQS|5.0|First time I saw Robots I was unimpressed. Then I had kids. We got this for my four year old to watch. He *loves* it, and I have to admit it's grown on me too.<br /><br />And there's a lot to love. The movie holds up very well to repeat viewing. The world has an incredible amount of detail, with lots of subtleties you don't notice the first dozen times. The plot is reasonably good, the voice acting is great, and it's got a nice pick-me-up moral. Even better, it's got some humor which will appeal to the adults without corrupting the children.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell: Rodney Copperbottom grows up poor, with big dreams of becoming an inventor. Once he's grown up, he goes to the big city to meet his idol, Bigweld, the greatest robot in the world. But, Bigweld has disappeared, and his company is being run by an evil corporate executive! What will Rodney do?<br /><br />If you've got a kid, it's worth buying this movie. This widescreen DVD has excellent quality encoding, and holds up to repeat plays.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game becomes easily addictive and is full of fun for all ages. It start off easy and become s increasingly difficult. It is colorful and an entertaining way to spend a few minutes,if the kids aren't bugging me for their turn.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter loves competing and taking care of her horse. this is a really fun app!  good for teaching responsibility
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Lotta fun.  Enough different from the original that it is not just a rehash.  If you like scify action you will enjoy.
0425252868|5.0|A great true story from a time of great duress when men's souls are tried to the extreme limits of human nature
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|We started following Phillip Phillips from his first appearance on Idol and were thrilled when he won!  His hit \\"Home\\" was an immediate favorite and we eagerly awaited the release of the complete CD.  It's every bit as good as we hoped -- none of the songs disappoint.
B007UZO3F6|5.0|My second Shuttle box. Upgraded to 16 GB with high end I7 processor. USB3 also included. Great box for what I do.
B00495ZE6M|2.0|I've enjoyed Simon's Cat on YouTube, and must say that the printed, static pictures just don't do the character (cat) justice. Some of the situations he gets into are funny, but I sorely miss the &#34;meow&#34; and the motions. Also, all the detail of each drawing is harder to see on an early Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is fun to play and it also makes you listen too. It is my first time using it and I like it a lot. I like how I can worry over what I need to buy or give to my horse in order to make it happy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You have to read  this book--that all I can say--peoples taste are different in books i understand.  But by reading this one you'll get what i mean!!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I am reviewing this for my 5 yearold. She says<br /><br />the game is awesome. She loves the animals, especially the babies. It is quite easy to figure out and I like the parental controls.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This novel by David Baldacci was good. I enjoyed reading it. It had a lot of action. I am a fan.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|I did feel like Clint was writing about his own life. Good family film for kids 13 & up. I would say at least that old because of the story & language.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Was really surprised at how good this story was.  Excellent concept with clever use of realistic science woven into a tense storyline.  Highly recommend it.  Agree with other reviewers that this would make a terrific movie.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I like SciFi but wasn't really sure about this. It turned out better than expected. Not great, but very good. It did have a well thought out and acted story line. A little hokey in a few places, but what SciFi movie doesn't have that.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I took my mom to see the movie and we both enjoyed it very much. She's seen the stage production before down in Los Angeles and love it, so we definitely had to see the movie. Naturally, I had to buy her the soundtrack to make her happy!  :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is cooooooolllllllllllll and has the best graphics. and the best tracks like the mine shaft over all the best ok
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I enjoyed this entire series and would recommend it to anyone who loves british history and dramas.  The original Downton Abby.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It does exactly what you'd expect it to! Very quick and easy interface, great for social network posting and such.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A lot more challenging than Temple run 1. I love all the different jumps and turns and the fire and the water fall.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|At first it was confusing of when the time I was taken to.  Once I got it straight then the book got more interesting.  The book held my all the way to the end.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|One of the best books I've read. I bought another 10 copies to give away to my friends. The book gets slightly technical but anyone can understand the point of the examples.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|E.L. James actually becomes a writer. The first 2 didn't impress me, this kept me reading. I suspect it'll be 3/4 of the movie plot
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just read the WOOL Omnibus. I am blown away. This is epic horror at its best.  There are a few internal logic problems, but the writing is solid and I ended up truly caring about the characters, sitting on the edge of my seat as they endured bad and worse situations.  Excellent protagonist.  Excellent bad guy (what a creep!), and excellent love interest.  The post-apocalyptic setting was rendered in plausible, wonderful, well-thought-out detail.  And the suspense kept ratcheting up.<br /><br />It feels a little bit like reading early Stephen King, for those of you who are into that. Hugh Howey isn't a King clone, but he has that same grand sense of style.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids absolutely love this version of TR. It's almost like it's in 3D. You feel like you're falling along with the character in the game. It's much more exciting, and challenging, after you've been playing the first version for a while.
B009JZSC9S|1.0|Producers are more interested in pushing their political causes than in producing good drama.  You have to suffer through the latest Hollywood politics in order to enjoy a few minutes of the good drama and acting.  Getting worse, not getting better.  A couple of days after I posted this review, I happened to notice that the original episode that ran 1/27/2013 had the all-time low ratings for any original GW episode.  Between the endless political propaganda and the abysmal and ludicrous storyline involving Kalinda and her thug husband, I'm not surprised.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives you the reader insight into the life and routine these men live everyday. I have more respect to everyone who chooses to sacrifice the way these men choose too.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Good seller, on time delivery, and the item was as described in the description,<br />I will buy from this seller again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Used to play thIs game on my pc and loved It. So I downloaded this game on my Android phone. It was free so gotta expect ads but they only pop up when you start a new game and you can close or skip them easily. I like if I am playing a game and if I can't finish it right then, I can close it and it stops the timer and saves where I left off. I play two suits and love it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I think it's a good HO game. I've played better stories but it was still fun. I stayed up all night playing it till it was over!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. makes me want a horse.<br />its also good for baby sitters &amp; parents. it helps keep.kids still in public places. its a great app.
B00138CYD4|5.0|Santana and his collaborations are  the best. Have been listening to Santana's music for years; it never disappoints  and always changes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good game. I like the graphics on the game and how the game itself was free. I just wish they had more of a choice with buying stuff instead of using gems.n
B0044C3RB4|5.0|if you love sci-fi shows like Star Trek, X-Files, this is definitely a show that you can get into. Fringe has a great range of storylines and crazy things that happen. Not to mention Walter (who is my favourite character) who is always smoking something or dropping acid. The show can be a good family show as well. If you haven't watched this show, i would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|all I can say is this is a really great game slow on getting gems but other then that love it
B006LSZECO|5.0|Once I started this book, I could not put it down! The craziness of this story absolutely drew me in. Give it a shot!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|In the original Grimm's fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel are abandoned by their parents, captured by a witch, and escape being eaten by pushing the witch into her own oven.  So what happened to them afterward?  Wonder no more. It turns out that brother and sister grew up to be witch-hunters in medieval Germany.  \\"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' is an interesting genre bender, part horror, humor and fantasy.<br /><br />The prologue retells the fairy tale.  As the story gets underway, Hansel and Gretel are in the City Augsberg, which is under siege by witches who are kidnapping children.  Brother and sister (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) are hired to hunt down the witches.  What they find is a bit more complicated, a large coven led by a grand witch (Framke Janssen) who are preparing for a special ceremony, for which Gretel is the missing ingredient.  She will need rescuing by Hansel, assisted by a local fanboy and a plucky white witch, in a dramatic finale that brings the siblings face to face with their own origins.<br /><br />The movie gets off to a bit of a slow start; its mixed elements make for a choppy delivery.  Renner and Arterton take a while to work up some chemistry as siblings.  Fortunately, the movie is full of surprises, including their medieval-tech weapons, and doesn't take itself entirely seriously.  The ending works well; recommended.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I know Taylor gets a lot of flack for allowing the majority of her music sound alike, but I like this album. I admit that I can't listen to it more than once in a row because it all starts to sound the same after a while, but isn't that any group or artist? Anyway, the beats are catchy and the lyrics are meaningful.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Almost real. Extremely fun and entertaining game. Keeps u busy and kills time wen there's nothing to do. When I'm bored I just click MY a pp
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very evocative of Studs Turkle's style. It allowed the reader's imagination to take over. Evevts told from a past perspective provided a creepy \\"reality\\" feel. Highly recommended!
1451648537|5.0|It is very well written. I enjoyed it. Even though he was a jerk, we will miss his incredible genius.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game except I only got to play once because it wouldn't open so I deleted it but now it still shows on my apps list. In conclusion good app but to many bugs that need fixing.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the first temple run so thought I would give the second one a try... well worth it.  Not the same game but better!
B009VTAG5A|4.0|Gonna make it short :<br /><br />as a Vinyl Fan that prefers Quality Over Quantity I gave this Issue 4 stars.<br /><br />* this one is the Non Numbered 2nd pressing (?)<br />* the gatefold Jacket is OK but nothing special they could have used better quality pictures or add a booklet or something but I guess they had to cut corners.<br />* the Vinyls are 180 gram probably pressed by RTI (they look similar to other RTI pressings that I own).<br />* it does sound a lot better than the CD, but nobody Knows : who mastered it, what source was used...etc. seems to be an OK Digital Source that was given to a Good Mastering engineer.<br /><br />on most songs you hear stuff a lot better than the CD, so the Bottom line is that if you love this album and you own a Good Stereo Equipment you will enjoy it even more.<br /><br />P.S for AMAZON and Music Companies :<br />you must change your attitude because Vinyls sales are growing each year.<br />please please please...when you release Music on Vinyls write about : source, Mastering Engineer, where was it pressed.<br /><br />Amazon - please separate the reviews for Vinyls from other versions of any album, these reviews can sell the product for other people that still wonder if the price is worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|greatly enjoyed the various games<br />easy for adults and kids. love the simple games and ability to pass and play
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Our daughter who lives in London sent us a copy of this, but they use a different recording format in Europe and it would not work on our player.  Amazon came through again!  Now we watch the series on TV as the new ones come out.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|A great read.<br /><br />I love Scarpeta.  It just gets more interesting and fun to read.  Read the books in sequence.  It's fun to keep up with the characters.

B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I connected the cable to a Bose SoundDock V1 and it does work. However, for some devices there's a rather loud hum. My iPad worked great as did my video camera. However, my TV and another MP3 player had a rather loud hum.
B005LAII12|4.0|Funny and very inappropriate!  Classic. Love the bluntness of it all some scenes are un forgettable.  That bear is crazy.
B007ZUU6SE|4.0|I was prompted to re-read the book after watching the latest movie adaptation.  The movie was awful.  Not only did it take handsful of liberties [the scene with Tony Esterhase being threatened with repatriation is one of the worst], but it just couldn't compete withe the  BBC/Paramount Pictures multi-hour version.<br /><br />As I re-read, I could see why producers would be attracted to this book.  The dialog and scene-setting are superb; the main character, George Smiley is a real human not a Bond-like fantasy; and the plot line is compelling.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey - from the story to its cast. I fell in love with it when the first season came out, and the second one is just getting better.
B009KG7EMC|5.0|Simon West (most noted as the screen writer of 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider') brings us the second instalment of 'The Expendables' franchise.<br /><br />The film is a 'Who's-Who' action movie, featuring nearly every action hero from the last two decades, such as: Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Li, Schwarzenegger and Willis all reprising their roles for this entertaining sequel. Completing the line-up is the legendary Chuck Norris making a great cameo appearance as the lone wolf.<br /><br />Ross (Stallone) is approached by CIA man Mr Church (Willis), who calls in his favour and tasks 'The Expendables' to go to the former Soviet Union to retrieve something that was on a crashed plane. The team find the package but are then ambushed and have their sniper killed by the aptly named Vilain (Van Damme), who leads a group called 'The Sangs'. And so begins a chase to stop Vilain find the buried plutonium and sell it - with some great battles and climaxes. This film is not meant to be taken seriously and the one-liners set the movie off perfectly.<br /><br />As reviewed in the February 2013 issue of An Cosant&oacute;ir (The Defender) The Irish Defence Forces Magazine by Sgt Wayne Fitzgerald - dfmagazine.ie - military.ie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this great game, so glad it is available on Kindle Fire! It used to give me problems, but I guess that was fixed with a recent update, so no problems now! Again, amazing game! Get it now!
B00ANAC32U|5.0|This bumper is great! It keeps my phone safe and it is looks nice on my new Nexus 4!!!!!! Love it! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very enjoyable and realistic. A great app to pass time. Great for kids unable to have real pets due to time or space.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to install and easy to play.  If you've played Mahjong on Pogo.com, then this game will be familiar to you.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It's pretty much like gta and its got good graphics but the controls are a little hard at first but this app is great for kindle fire
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game for a beginner, esp. to kindle and wanted a mind puzzle type of game.  Keeps me busy, don't get bored by it too easily.
8866131105|4.0|I love this Moleskine.  I was worried about it being too thick, but it is not.  I can carry both it and the Moleskine Memo Pockets Large in my medium-sized purse without issue.
630463949X|5.0|I bought this as a replacement since I lost the earlier DVD. Buying a replacement speaks for itself on how I'd rate this DVD.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app was free on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;. It is a file manager that allows me to store documents of various file types and easily search for them on the device. The tools also helps  easily store, locate, install, and remove  either Kindle or other providers' apps. The screenshot file folder works very well as you can view, email, or print to a browser, virtual device, or viewer depending on the method you opt from a &#34;share&#34; menu available on the Kindle. There are various options with which to view, categorize, and store as well. For a &#34;free&#34; app, this is one you might want to have!

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a free app that I downloaded to my Kindle Fire HD and my grand daughter's Kindle Fire HD. WARNING! It is highly addictive and fun! My adult daughter often &#34;borrows&#34; my Kindle to play it too.<br /><br />There is a free demo app which I tried first. However, using my Amazon Kindle's &#34;Free App of the Day&#34; app, I got the full version for free! You draw a stick figure of yourself and a friend, then name them. They become animated in a story which takes them on several layers of adventures. You are actually trying to save your stick-friend from a villain who immediately captures him at the start of the game. You are fending off dragons, stinging bees, spiders, and zombies, etc. If not careful, setting fire or causing lightening to destroy items can also destroy you! Picking up puzzle pieces and unlocking items for clues with items you draw are hilarious! OMG!...FUN!!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|This free app was downloaded by and for my grand daughter to her Kindle Fire device. She LOVES it. It is the interface between her, her friends, school, and social life. Anything that she is happy with that won't hurt her or anyone else, cost me, and is functional is acceptable.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|At first I thought about all the supernatural aspects of &#34;white noise&#34; that I have come across and thought about this item. However, I read the details before downloading and find it to be quite soothing. I must admit that I downloaded the &#34;lite&#34; version of it first. It is a FREE app I installed to my Kindle Fire HD. Some very clear and interesting sound effects are pre-installed like the sound of a rail-car on railroad tracks, REAL WHITE NOISE, rain/thunderstorms, hair dryers, ceiling fans, purring cats, waterfalls, water dripping, heartbeats, grandfather clocks, chimes, etc. are actually soothing! The sounds are preset to continuously loop for long play and  play in the background while working on other things on the device. The app can be set like an alarm or snooze and other sounds are made available for downloading periodically. The right sound can mean a great deal less stress too! I hope you like it....I do!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This author has presented an intriguing concept that should be of interest to readers who are interested in higher awareness and enlightenment.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The free version of this app was on my Kindle Fire HD when I got it. However, it did not allow me to create nor print documents. I found the PRO version in Kindle Apps online via Amazon and purchased it for some $16.00. I am glad I did. I was able to use a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation software very similar to Microsoft's Office software. They, of course, aren't as powerful...but remember, I'm on a tablet...not a computer! For what I can do with this app, I am grateful! The Easyprint App from Amazon Kindle Apps works great with this and allows me to designate my WIFI-enabled multi-function printer to cloud print from my Kindle! I am VERY HAPPY with it! My Kindle is also set to use a secure, portable hotspot which allows me to access internet and WIFI cloud  printing while on the go! This sounds like a winner for busy people who have a moderate understanding of geek-speak and can hook these apps and devices together for productivity and portability! Great +  Low-Cost/FREE investments = happy Users!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Real good case keeps dirt and ALL foreign debries out and fits like a glove.need more colors, real nice product
1451695195|2.0|For those who've read previous books on NDA's, this is just another personal account.  The only difference here is that the patient is a neurosurgeon. The story drags almost painfully through a long, drawn-out description of his medical condition and the gestures of each of his relatives, colleagues and friends. It's not that I disagree with his conclusion, I simply think it's a bad read. For non=believers, no proof is enough. For believers, no proof is necessary.
B00632HWOG|5.0|really good mail. no glitches good good good good cant say much more, ned to change your format. tes U do
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky and Holder are so beautiful. Ths book had me feeling all kinds of emotion. There are so many twists and turns, and things I didn't see coming. I love the fact that there were no clif hangers, and no missing pieces leaving me to wonder. Uuhhhh-mazing job Colleen Hoover! Would definetely recommend!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A very good read.  Some spirituality but very convincing.  WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO IS SUFFERING FROM A TERMINAL ILLNESS AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILY
B001UDPAB0|5.0|GREAT MOVIES!!! I would recommend these movies to anyone who enjoys the Vegas lifestyle without the gambling. Also how could I forget Andy Garcia. I could watch these movies over and over and nevever get tired of the plotting and planning.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My child was excited about a part 2 to this game.  However on my Android, it is difficult to view the screen, with all the extra clutter.  It is not so bad on the iPod.  You ought to up date it !!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's really fun game I recommend this to everybody to get it my disaster loves to play this game and you would like it to
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Everytime I try to get in to this app It says there is a problem  Have never been able to access this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun app have fun for hours can dress up rider and horse in anything. from a Mohawk to a long flowing mane
B00899F0G8|5.0|Awesome- sums up this season. This season keeps you on the edge. It keeps you wanting more- exciting, thrilling, and many surprises. A must see for everyone.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. The plot was clever and catching.<br />I did not figured out the ending, which is rare for me.
B004FP1WX0|3.0|Had to see this movie after hearing the word &#34;Catfishing&#34; to describe the plight of the Notre Dam Heismann trophy contender.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My daughter (14) was shocked and laughed when she came into my office and heard me listening to this CD. &#34;My Dad is listening to One Direction?!&#34; She had purchased their 2nd album and I figured I'd fill in some blanks based on one tune i really liked. And I really liked the whole CD. Listened to it a lot - while I work and in the car.
B000V9KFLY|5.0|I am a big fan of Celine's singing, there are very few songs by her that I dislike. I think that she is a first class lady
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love this series. Had to have the season set on DVD. Great chemistry amongst the cast. Not quite on a par with The Good Wife - but a close runner up.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I can't tap on the sign . I try to tap but nothing happens :(  I can not tap sign and they should add dogs to survivalcraft.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas Albums and the pairing on the duets are so worth it.  Ended up getting for my Dad because he liked my itunes so much.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I just starting playing Mystery Manor because my sister got me hooked on it. She's  been playing for almost a year. It was easy for me to understand the game because she explained it to me. But is a little complicated. Is a long game, you collect gifts, all kind of artifacts and get to make friends that will also send you gifts. You don't have to be in Facebook to play.<br />Rule num 1, don't use all the diamonds, hold on to them.<br />Rule num 2, be patience because is a long process.<br />Download and try Mystery Manor if you like Hidden Object games.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|The winter tile puzzle is frozen after completing spring.I cannot go further. google turns up many having the issue but no solutions. Maple Fire Games has not responded to my tech request email. I'm bummed.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed.  Haven't read this author before but seriously will look for more books by her in the near future.
0823016714|5.0|My cousin has taken a real interest in drawing, and while he has a natural talent and can draw incredibly lifelike figures, we thought this would be useful for him because it shows so many different expressions you may never think you would need to see in front of you. Until that one moment when you just can't get the right look on your masterpiece's face. I've heard he's been using it a lot and playing around with the different expressions. I think it will also give him ideas for drawings by presenting him with some emotions he may not have thought to draw. Great for any artist! Would also be good for someone who does film work and wants to tell an actor what kind of expression they want from them, or something along those lines.
B003DNN0L2|1.0|I was interested the forst 20 minutes or so but soon became bored and annoyed by this film so I was disappointed
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|amazing book it suck me in for hours of time the only part i didn't like was Percy falling into Therous
B0015DYIH2|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Although it ended different than the movie. Breaking dawn the twilight saga was<br />A very good book and movie.
B004XZR63M|3.0|Too often we say, if I could just........<br />If I could just get that raise, If I could just get that promotion, if I could just find a job; rather than making life happen.  Don't sit around and wait for life to happen,but go out and make your own opportunities.  Robert Kiyosaki gives you the inspiration and vision to make the necessary changes in our lives.  He teaches us to invest in our selves first, before we go out and buy the toys.  He explains that we should always be learning.  Our education does not stop after college, but must be continuous.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Don't even load it. It allows 3 free print jobs then shuts down. Then you have to buy the full app to use it. But it does not tell you that in th description.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Would have liked more description for the other side.  I would expect it is difficult to relate something this mind blowing to the average human in this plane, but this adventure is so extraordinary that more elaboration would have been good.  Like how did he physically feel, could he look at himself, see himself, or was he just floating around.  Maybe it doesn't really matter how you look or feel physically once you have left this planet, as long as you are you.  I have often wondered when we move over to the other side, and if we meet again people we knew before, what are their features.  And if we go thru many lives on earth, which one do we see when we leave each time.  Probably something like looking at someone here who is dressed differently each day, different hair style etc.  Except over there you are &#34;dressed&#34; in a different body, sexual orientation etc.  I like the way Michael Newman asked questions of his patients under hypnosis.  And the answers seemed logical.  That we are all learning here on earth and learning when we leave.  In the end the author of this book discovered what I would expect (or hope to expect) and that is that we are all connected with God, (we may even be God in little bits, and combined we are All That Is)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved it. It was very entertaining and thrilling. The monster was scary. And the game play was challenging yet it kept me interested.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|i had the digital download and i loved it so much i got the vinyl.  my only complaint is that it is 2 LPs and not one the grooves are spread out so there are only 3 track on each side (but i already have the mp3s and i love the album so it is a solid 5 stars).  means i have to get up more, why couldn't they do a standard LP and make it all on one, but all the tracks are great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is an addicting game that teaches children ages 8-12 to be responsible with pets and teaches them to care for them daily. I recommend this app for children 8-12.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|For the first time in your life you find yourself rooting for a serial killer and hoping around each corner he doesn't get caught!
0143039482|2.0|This book was smashed into a flat package that was extremely difficult to open.  The cover and some inside pages are bent.  The back cover is halfway ripped off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for everyone and super addictive. I highly recommend it for horse lovers and anyone else, even those who don't want to pay for the extras.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|My little brother has been watching Dr. Who for years. Whenever I was at his house and would see a snippet I'd make a comment about how silly it was. Then, my genius brother sucked me in by making me watch a Weeping Angel episode. I started back at the beginning (the new, 2005 beginning) and I admit I was really wrong, what seemed to me to be frenetic and sloppy work turns out to be engaging, funny and very well thought out.<br /><br />For me, watching from the beginning made the difference, and it's what I'd suggest to anyone else. One of my favorite shows, hands down.
B00168ML1G|5.0|This, along with The Avengers are probably my favorite Marvel movies. Robert Downey Jr. just brings the character of Tony Stark / Iron Man to life, and the whole cast works together really well. The same with The Avengers.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This has not arrived yet. But we know we will love it based on how much we loved seasons 1 & 2.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I have this app on my kindle fire HD and it seems to crash... a lot! It also doesn't really work how they say it is supposed to. You are supposed to just click on what you want to watch, click the screen you want to watch it on and it will play. It definitely doesn't do that. I had to go to my ps3 and find my kindle under the network and then play from there. Half the time though this app crashes. Glad I didn't pay for it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|There are not enough superlatives. The story is great. The acting is brilliant. The setting and scenery are wonderful. We have already ordered Season 3.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show is great.  It's original.  I'm surprised that the same people who wrote Two and a Half Men can write something so much better.  It does still get sexually suggestive at times, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children.  But for the price, this is going to be your best buy.  30 percent cheaper than other stores, at least as of our purchase in January 2013.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a fun game for every one you can not thick that their will be a new and improved temple run it is called temple run 2
B001N18HMS|5.0|The Empyrean definitely transports me to another world; it causes me to stop and think about a lot of things, about time, life, love, about our place in the universe, and no I am not high. Frusciante has a particular tone in his voice that I enjoy listening to, in my opinion this record is simply beautiful, it appeals to my emotions. Great artwork also.<br /><br />I`m a child of the digital age, but I am sure half of me does not belong to this time, so I buy vinyl whenever I can, this one includes a digital download.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|very sturdy and durable. I love the color! I can easily find it with the bright purple cover. LOVE IT!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Easy and fun to read with a lot of quotable material about life's journey and lessons.  Have already recommended to others.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I  felt it was a little to technical for me at times, but coming from a Dr. I understood why.  I enjoyed reading about his life and journey to heaven.

044042321X|3.0|The story is nice but the only thing that I felt this graphic novel didn't deliver is the graphics. Pay closer attention to it and you'll see that it is pretty poor in some frames. Graphically, its a let down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much!!! I feel like I have a real pet and everything. and it's so much fun to do too. :)
B007N5YIUS|5.0|What can I say about angry birds in space? Well I love playing it and I think it is the person who gets upset when they can't get through a part lol I do admit I use cheats sometimes.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In this book each chapter had a spellbinding affect on the reader. Story well told for the final book of The Hunger Games. THE ENDING WAS CLIMATIC WITH ITS HIGH AND LOW WAVES BRINGING THE FINAL CHAPTER TO THE END.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I'm a Twilight Saga fan, so I LOVE IT!  Not at all disappointed.  I recommend this for anyone who is a Twilight fan!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This book was great, in the sense of it being a bit predictable but not so predictable but relatable as well.... I give this book a four because  it's full of heartbreak, love, friendship, travel, burgers....and a little math. I would read this book again because it takes me away....
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I'm a Twilight Saga fan, so I LOVE IT!  Not at all disappointed.  I recommend this for anyone who is a Twilight fan!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire. I have always loved minecraft , I think this app is awesome and I totally recommend it. There is no heath bar in this game and animals don't give food , but there are animals. Blocks are unlimited in creative mode and in survival mode you have to gather blocks. I don't think this game works as great on a smart phone because it is so small , tablets work best as far as not straining your eyes. The terrain in creative mode is not unlimited and in survival mode I don't know if it's unlimited. I hope this helps you and if your new to minecraft I recommend getting the free version first. =)
B00633W614|5.0|Wasn't very excited at first to read this but after a few chapters I was drawn in. Great story, I recommend it!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Super cutter and love the ease of use. Be sure that you have really ice cold water and that whatever you use to submerse the bottles is tall enough to cover the score line
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The case will stand in any position.  I can just close the case and my kindle with shut off and when I open it, it will just turn on.  I use the strap to hold it closed, but it is also good for holding my stylus, so I don't loose track of it.  I am very happy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed the book front to back.  An astronaut stranded on Mars.  How could that be more than an essay?  Read it and you will find out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very Heartfelt and makes you want to enjoy what's really important in your life, the simple pleasures of long walks and bike rides with your family.
1468179993|5.0|Donovan provides very practical and straight-forward insights to public speaking and the delivery of \\"TED\\"--like presentations. Essentially, he is able to boil down the process to visual storytelling, which is an important skill for most public speakers. The book is a good resource and works well as a supplement to other material on the topic of public speaking.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is addictive. Lots of cool new features. And even save me that you can earn by collecting gems! I would highly recommend this game to temple run lovers.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Still not sure how I feel about the book or the series...there were times I quit reading and then times I couldn't put it down.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Gameplay is an improvement over the first one since now you have more stuff to upgrade and achievments actually earn you experience and you get stuff with each level but the controls dont feel as tight as the first one and the titling feels a little stiff. now for some reason my game keeps crashing and sending me back to the kindles home screen before i even get to the menu. it shows the imangi screen then shuts down every time i open it
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, I play all the time. I had several years without access to auto play. Very Nice!

B0087ZG7FC|5.0|Classic Movie!! That's all to it!!!! One of teh greatest movies ever made!!! The casting was excellent and it clearly depicted the early 80's!!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|AMAZING!!!  The 5.1 mix is as good as a live one gets-IF YOU LIKE THIS YOU MUST CHECK OUT THE BLU RAY AUDIO OR BD-A OF THIS!!! THE 5.1 UNCOMPRESSED PCM TRACK (6.9 MBps!)

Clearly the fidelity on vinyl is obviously, close to, perfect.  However; I have found that Blu Ray Audio, being so incredibly high in bitrate, well, sounds perfect also!  And the BD-A also has the LP's beat as far as sonic capabilities...If we all buy the BD-A, it is rumored that the CATALOG will be remastered with stereo and 5.1 PCM tracks and a dts-HDMA 5.1 (inferior to the PCM; don't use it unless you must-I assume that's its function<br />Also 180-200 gram virgin vinyl LP's; one-side and using the (what happened to half-speed masters? 45 RPM is better 'resolution', but half-speed is higher fidelity) 45 RPM option that has become so popular with Jazz, Classical and Blues.<br />BLU RAY AUDIO-CHECK IT OUT!!![[ASIN:B009E3EY38 Celebration Day (Deluxe Edition 2CD, 1 Blu-Ray, 1 DVD (CD sized digipak)]][[ASIN:B009E9R2OK Celebration Day (Blu-Ray Audio)]][[ASIN:B009E9R1IM Celebration Day (3 LP Vinyl Package)]]These-yes all 3-are a Zeppelin necessity!
B0015HOFZI|4.0|very simple turntable.  With the USB port allows connection to the computer to save some old records.  The JIC cords to the amp could have been longer.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|The soundtrack to the movie Les Miserables lacks many of the songs I enjoyed, such as the one when Jean ValJean sings &#34;who am I?&#34; and bursts into the courtroom.  Parts of songs are cut off, such as &#34;In my life&#34; which omits the part sung by Cossette.  The whole argument between Cossette and Jean ValJean is missing.  In short, I was expecting a lot more of the show music to be available.  I suppose they'll come out with a longer version later.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Had fun with this, but realize I will need a lot more practice before graduating to the real thing. I enjoyed it, though.
0061780308|5.0|My Veterinarian highly recommended I read this book.  WOW!  I could not put it down and read it in one weekend at the beach.We then bought the CD Audio Version.  Heartwarming story narrated by the dog.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I am a grandmother.  I grew up on bugs bunny, daffy duck, Yosemite Sam, and thought the humor of these cartoons was long gone, but I laughed my head off at the &#34;I have a Dream&#34; scene.  Hilarious!!
1400052173|5.0|This book has become one of the few which I have purchased more than one of. Needed to buy more to give as gifts. It joins &#34;Indian Givers&#34; on my short list.
076781326X|1.0|Had a crack in disc when it arrived. I was disappointed I couldn't watch it and it wasn't worth the aggravation of trying to replace it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was so happy to find there was finally a temple run 2! I got it immediately and I don't regret it at all!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought the 1st one was good, but this one is way better!!! This is a great game and I believe everyone should have it because the best part is that its free
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Saying that although I needed a lot more in the end....because I was interested....I actually enjoyed what was there...but as it was game into movie.....as real movie if you aren't of that generation I needed more but not a waste...I enjoyed and maybe learned about those years younger than me....just don't ask me to play the games....I've tried and frustration made me feel violent and that was a fishing game!!!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.<br /><br />Oops! I've reviewed the audio book version available from Amazon's sister site Audible. Since I can't contribute to what's already been said about the original book, I'll leave this'wrong' review in place.
B009YMLH5C|4.0|Suspenseful and unpredictable....I'd love to actually see a sequal just to know what could have happened next although the ending was an ending and satisfactory...I hate things with an ending obviously meant to leave you hanging wait some time and spend money for. A sequal...give me an ending even if its one I must ponder...thought actors and even sci fi part of it all believable and a place at one time or another any of us could have dreadfully made a bad decision in our youth finding ourselves in the characters shoes.....and it wasnt a damper but truly a thinker in reviewing our own individual values and choices what might you do......I always spend a lot of time reading reviews before getting movie...I hate crud...this was pleasant surprise which kept me tense and caught up in what was going to happen.....spent 20 years working with teens and young people.....if mine weren't grown...it's a movie we would watch together certain to allow great discussion and roll play......
B009LH1WLO|4.0|First of all I am happy they have increased the episodes that Misha (castiel) is involved in. Am I the only person who thinks that Cas added alot to the series when he was introduced! He became like both a naive young brother and knowledgable older brother to both winchesters, and has become more one of the winchester family than 'the angel'. This allows him to be involved in stories beyond the angel/deomen storyline.<br /><br />That is the first downside i have to this series. there is very little of the old interaction between castiel and the brothers. they got to a very relaxed place at one point and now they are almost behaving like they did in series four. with the loss of Bobby you would have thought that the directors would have used him more.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this series though is Benny. He is a good actor, but come on! a friendly vampire! isn't that a bit overdone at this point. Supernatural has always done inventive (if strange) stories, which have helped it stay on so long. But now it is reduced to a friendly vampire!<br /> Leave it alone please!!!!<br />I thought that this show at least would chart its own course and not fall in with the fads that everyone else is following.<br /><br />I understand that at the end of the day the show needs to evolve and introduce new characters into its world, after all how many times can we watch Sam and dean argue with each other! But The show needs to stick the character of Benny in the bin, stop killing off (or reducing the time of) every single well loved character on the show, and then it might get back to its best.<br /><br />I still enjoy Supernatural and will continue watching it as long as they keep the standards as high as they are now. This series is well worth watching. I just think that with a few simple adaptations they could get the show from great back to the amazing it once was.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent read. Explains the series much better and makes it more enjoyable. Going to buy book two now. That's all.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Azada  is a mini-puzzles lovers dream!  A fairly decent range of difficulty levels and puzzle types. All are do-able, although some may take a few tries (the Robot).  You  have a time limit that will force you to start chapters over, but the feeling you get when you finally finish the chapter is really satisfying.  I feel there is replay value and there is a setting to allow you to play the rest of the games from the chapters already finished.  I highly recommend.<br />Azada 2 was a little different than this.  Please another one like  the first?<br />Played on a Kindle Fire with no problems at all.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A compelling collection of short stories that steadily fills in the bigger picture.  Alternately funny, terrifying and sad, you can enjoy it in short bursts, or one extended wild ride.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is really cool app. I would rate 5 stars but it takes way to long to load. other than that I love it!

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Much more action than the first. Great story line. Hot romance. But is he really that good? It makes you want to say, \\"Hmmh\\"
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I wanted way more discriptive detail about huis journey, especially when he felt he was  in heaven for such a lengthly time.
