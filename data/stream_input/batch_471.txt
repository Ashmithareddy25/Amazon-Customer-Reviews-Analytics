0140177396|5.0|This is a wonderful story, superbly written, which centers around two men during the depression.  One of them is \\"slow\\" and very lovable.  It is a short book and a quick read.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Everyone should read this book.  An easy and enjoyable way to get a classic on your reading list.
B00005K3OT|2.0|Ho hum, yet another film about how the stuffy among us need to loosen up a bit.  In this case the setting is a small French town with a prudish mayor (a real live Count, no less) whose grip on his people is slowly pried away by the arrival of a mysterious lady in red (one of many, many cliches employed here) who makes chocolate with a little something extra that frees its imbibers from their inhibitions.     Although the filmmakers are sure to show that no one goes too far into sin for any reasonable person, this is apparently not the case for the prideful and repressed mayor, his puppet of a young priest, and their parishioners, but by film's end even the mayor is partaking of her confections and providing a noticeable presence at an apparently pagan ceremony held next door to the church.    It could only be more trite if they'd sing \\"Koom-By-Yah.\\"  Fortunately the film is very pretty to look at and there are a few moments with some dramatic tension, notably involving a big dumb lug who beats his wife and her escape from his clutches but, even in moments when a character (usually the mayor) has a momentous decision to make, the character almost always goes exactly the direction we would expect.  Johnny Depp, second only to Denzel Washington on my list of favorite actors, is completely wasted here; his role has possibilities but the script takes this character absolutely nowhere and could have been played just as well by anyone with a SAG card.    Such a shame.  I absolutely love chocolate, but this drek almost gives it a bad name.
B000021XS0|3.0|DT is one of my favorite bands. So when this album came out I was pretty quick to snap one up. <br /> <br />I was very disappointed with the album upon first listening though. I have warmed a great deal to it since, but I still feel it is not their best work. Many songs had great content but felt flat or unfinished. Some songs sounded good but didn't have the normal DT flair and attention to detail. A few of the lyrics were just plain absurd, DT has always had strong song writing as one of its best strengths. <br /> <br />Overall it was a sad album for the group. I'd rank it as worth listening too but not worth buying unless you are a real DT fan who wants all their albums. If you are new to DT, get Awake first and either \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Train of Thought\\" second. They are much better albums then this one.
0425188809|1.0|I read another Amazon review of this book that made some good points. The reviewer gave Watchers two stars and said it was Koontz's best. He has a point there. Koontz is a very frustrating writer because you can see he has all the tools to be a great novelist (at least in supermarket fiction), but all of his books are mediocre and unsatisfying. A two-star review may very well be Koontz's best, but I disagree that Watchers is it.<br /><br />This is an awful book. It starts out great, with the one guy feeling lost in life, whereupon he comes across a super-intelligent dog, with the hint of a monster coming after them. Then there's the woman who has to deal with a stalker. But things fall into place so easily and quickly after that: Travis and the dog save Nora from the stalker without breaking a sweat, then Travis and Nora fall in love and get married, all without a hitch... The dog Einstein is written in such a corny way that only winsome housewife readers (sorry!) could see it as cute and endearing.<br /><br />But the monster is still out there! If you've ever read a Dean Koontz book before, or one by any other bad supermarket fiction author, you'll probably guess that everything comes out in a happy ending. All of Koontz's books are basically the same. I thought I was reading Soul Survivor at times, because the formula is identical: characters overcome suffering, discover something that could bring new insight for the human race, have to survive a deadly menace, have the happy ending and predictable positive character development, and of course the good guys all live and the bad guys get it...<br /><br />This book became so predictable, so corny, so formulaic that I started to get that feeling that often comes when one ODs on pulp fiction: I started wanting the monster and the cool killer to waste all the good guys, including the genius dog, and then go to Vegas and celebrate. End of story.<br /><br />Someone needs to tell Koontz that he can't write dialogue, his \\"humor\\" is not funny, there is NO SUSPENSE WHEN WE KNOW HOW IT WILL END, and that all of his books are the same thing, over and over again. I was astonished to read the author's afterword in this book, when he brags about how he's always writing radically different works every time, whereas other writers just put out the same thing in order to get sales. I almost choked on my Diet Coke when I read that. This is a man who has no self-awareness. I'm one of those readers who will finish a book I start, no matter how bad it is--and I've finished some bad, bad books in my life--but honestly, I couldn't finish this one. After 365 pages I said, \\"That's it.\\" Back to the library with you.<br /><br />I couldn't finish this book, so how do I know that the good guys live, the bad guys die, and all is well and beautiful in the end? I can say it with authority because this is Dean Koontz. Only if you've never read a paperback thriller in your life can you possibly be surprised. The characters in this book sucked, I wanted them to die, I wanted the bad dialogue to die as well, and I wanted the cops to die in their dumb sub-plot, and I wanted the dog Einstein to die--and I love dogs.<br /><br />And I want Koontz to write something different for once, and actually use the tools and potential he has. No sunny ending, no black and white simplicity, and no generic title that sounds like all of his other books.dialogue, his \\"humor\\" is not funny, there is NO SUSPENSE WHEN WE KNOW HOW IT WILL END, and that all of his books are the same thing, over and over again.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is a great album by a great band.<br /><br />I would go so far as to say that this is in Dream Theater's top 3 albums right behind \\"Awake\\" and \\"Images and Words\\". Before I bought this album I had heard some negative things about it. I had heard that it was so different from other Dream Theater work that it wasn't worth a fans time and that it was too heavy and they were trying to be something that they aren't. It these same detractors that would have had Led Zepplin put out \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" in spanish as the premiere track on their third album. Thank God they nixed that one.<br /><br />But I digress. The point is, just because it is different, does not mean it isn't worth our time. In fact, i found this album to be a refreshing change. A lot heavier for them, with tones of Black Sabbath and classic Mettalica, it is not what many have come to expect from Dream Theater. At times the lyrics seem more chosen for harshness or to fit into a space then for purpose, unlike previous DT albums, but I didn't find it glaring.<br /><br />The songs are fresh and hard hitting with all the talent DT has come to be known for. I enjoy every song on the album, and I'm fairly picky. There is one spot on one song I don't care for, but it is something DT has done before. There is a very short (maybe 4 seconds) piano solo that seems to fit better in Keystone Cops then in a rock album. It's nestled in a very hard and very long guitar/piano solo (duet?) and it just breaks the mood of an otherwise dark and fast song.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend the album to anyone who already likes DT, or for metal fans. But for those into prog rock and new to DT I would recommend Awake first.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|\\"Sweet Fanny Adams\\" was one of the two UK albums which was the source for tracks on the American \\"Desolation Boulevard\\"(the other tracks on the U.S.A. album were taken from the UK \\"Desolation Boulevard\\" & non-L.P. singles).This remaster adds 6 non-L.P. singles tracks,but no outtakes or vault tracks.The previous BMG remaster from Germany in 1999 had only 2 bonus tracks.How does the sound compare? This new UK remaster has brighter sound.It's a matter of personal taste,but I prefered the sound on the 1999 German CD.But it would be hard to dispute that having more bonus tracks here makes this CD a better overall value than the 1999 German CD.
B000002JQ6|4.0|Wasn't there like two (2) different versions of this live album put out? Yes, 'Live' was a long-awaited release and the only reason I give it a four star rating instead of five is the fact that there is a gap of silence between each and every song. Why don't record companies just make a / any live recording sound as if it came from JUST one show? I love it when a live CD has that going for it. Total of fourteen tunes that were recorded from the band's 'Razer's Edge' world tour 1990-91. Tracks that I enjoyed reliving again and again were their memorable opener \\"Thunderstruck\\", \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" (one of my personal all time favorites), \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"TNT\\" and their traditional encore number \\"For Those About To Rock\\". One reason that I may not be going ga-ga over this CD is that I've recently located an import (bootleg, maybe?) of a 2-CD titled 'Berlin, 2003' and that thing totally rips!!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This is awesome. All the songs are pretty good, especially \\"Defying Gravity\\". Get it. Love it. Listen hard.
B000000P11|5.0|I discovered The Chameleons in 1983. I was instantly mesmerized by their haunting yet intense sound. I am now in my 40's and carry their music everywhere I go. I am an artist and they inspire me more than any other band, and I have heard them all!<br /><br />I will never forgot dancing to them on Tuesday nights at the(in)famous underground club 688 in Atlanta.. I just can't imagine not having this music in my life. From their song Second Skin ...\\"and is this the stuff dreams are made of\\".. Yes.
0312330529|5.0|What a great book! It was one of those that I did not want to end. A great story, great philosophical insights and a wealth of learning about the culture and customs of Bombay, India as a whole and all of South Asia. A real epic. The book was so obviously autobiographical on the part of the author that it makes me wonder if he got another one in him.
0385510454|4.0|Another very good Grisham book that kept me busy for all of 2 days.  I couldn't put it down.  This time the lawyer is just a bought and paid for lobbyist that gets greedy trying to sell military secrets to a country other than his own. You know: The typical Washington DC scumbag that makes us all so proud of our legislative branch.  But, in true Grisham form, the scumbag gets knocked around enough to discover that there is more to life than ripping off his fellow Americans.  In the end, even I liked him.
B000021XR5|4.0|\\"No. 4\\" is a meeting of the ways between STP's heavier sound (\\"Core\\", a few parts of \\"Purple\\") and their more colorful pop sound (\\"Tiny Music\\", the other parts of \\"Purple\\").  <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Down\\", \\"Heaven & Hot Rods\\", and \\"Sex & Violence\\" are examples of the former; crunching guitar riffs, powerful hooks, snarling vocals. Very raw, very intense, very \\"Core\\"-like.  <br /> <br />\\"No Way Out\\" sounds like STP's stab at nu-metal. Not that there's any rapping, but the main riff sounds straight outta Godsmack. It's a decent song, but even STP can't make something truly special. <br /> <br />\\"Sour Girl\\" is a delicious blend of swirling psychedelic pop with arguably the band's best hook to date. The song is cool as heck, and the chorus really soars.  <br /> <br />And \\"Glide\\" brings back the spellbinding dreaminess that made \\"Still Remains\\" (from \\"Purple\\") such a great song. And it's different enough to not feel like a retread. <br /> <br />The album closes with the Doors-inspired \\"Atlanta\\", a haunting accoustic number with a majestic bridge. It sounds more like something from Scott Weiland's solo effort \\"12 Bar Blues\\" than a STP song, but it's great nonetheless. <br /> <br />Other highlights include \\"Pruno\\" (both atmospheric and heavy), \\"Church on Tuesday\\" (breezy, melodic pop/rock), \\"I Got You\\" (a lush, folky ballad) and \\"MC5\\" (a punk romp inspired by, obviously, MC5).  <br /> <br />Even though it's not a huge progression musically, \\"No. 4\\" is another fantastic album from STP. If you like memorable riffs, catchy hooks, and all around great songs, you'll find plenty to like here.  <br /> <br />Best Songs: Sour Girl, Glide, I Got You, Sex & Violence, Pruno.
B00007BKVC|5.0|I just bought the Thelma and Louise DVD and was so angry that I didnt get to see the documentary that is supposed to be on the disk. Hopefully I am just incredibly dense and cant find it, but if I'm not why is is gone from the disk?
0316172324|5.0|I just began reading this book. <br /> <br />And with having past knowledge of decision making, I understand what this book will already be about. <br /> <br />But to say that you expected a manual on how to refine your snap judgements; Maybe you should read the book twice. I understand it isnt a manual to do what you wanted it to do, but within the first two chapters i see hints on how to refine your snap judgements.  <br /> <br />For instance the example about the deck of cards, the subjects being tested got the idea of how it works after a while. Thus experience in a certain field can make you have better judgements.  <br />I was once told an example of a manager(i believe) and how he always forecasted the number of sales for a certain product, almost perfectly, without doing specific calculations. Granted it took him some time of pacing back and forth in a room mumbling to himself. But his intuitive thinking led him to make a decision that didnt take him hours of numbers, to figure out. It was all in his brain, juat as Gladwell described; \\"and some part of their brain did a series of instant calculations...\\" <br />but when he moved into a marketing setting, his snap judgements didnt work. (assuming because of his lack of experience there) <br /> <br />I believe in order to start making snap judgements, you must prepare yourself for \\"lateral thinking\\" and other methods of smart decision making. Just as the example of the statue. They had experts view this statue, and they thought it was real. But the thing they overlooked is, their bias. That they \\"wanted\\" it to be real. <br /> <br />Im off to continue reading this book, but just as The Tipping Point, theres small details you might miss that are hidden beneath the surface of the words, that can help you/train you help you find the \\"maven\\". <br /> <br />i hope this helped.
B00003CXSM|4.0|This was one of Jennifer Lopez's better movies.  She was extremly funny with Matthew McConaughey and was very witty.  I never thought of her as a good actress, but in this movie I thought that she played her character well.  There was so many funny and awkward scenes that made me laugh.  Some people may think that this movie was bad, but it was actually a great movie.  It may not be my all time favorite  movie but it was, but it is a good \\"chick flick\\" and a good movie to watch for a rainy day.
B0000259CP|5.0|This album is universally regarded as the Beach Boys' masterpiece, and who am I to disagree?  You might say that this was the band's peak, but I would say that they actually peaked with the \\"Good Vibrations\\" single after this.  But Pet Sounds is certainly their peak from an album standpoint.  This album always ranks among the top ten albums of all time in any survey of critics, and rightly so.  If you can't appreciate how great this album is, I feel sorry for you.
B00005UOXL|4.0|A year after the dissolution of Generation X, its lead singer, William Michael Albert Broad, a.k.a. Billy Idol, embarked on a solo career and released his eponymous solo debut.  Some of the harder tracks recalled the wild youth of the Gen X years, but the singles indicated a polishing of that style, meaning less punk guitar, but an emphasis on carefully synced bass and drums, airy synths, and glitzy production.<br /><br />\\"White Wedding Part 1\\" encompasses the successful formula, pulsing bass, Steve Stevens fiery guitar, thudding techno drum beats, airy backup vocals, and Idol's menacing deeper voice which ratcheted to its old punk fury when he screams \\"start again!\\"  Though cracking the Top 40, it's an Idol and essential 80's classic.<br /><br />\\"Hot In The City,\\" another single, with synths and soulful backup singers adding to the lounge-like ambience of the mid-paced song.  Idol's crooning is a far cry from \\"Your Generation,\\" to be sure.  As for \\"Love Calling,\\" it's a bit of punk with some Caribbean-style rhythms mixed in with horns and rock guitar, relying on a constant drum backbeat, which is the sole thing playing, giving this song a somewhat minimalist visage.<br /><br />Of the non-singles, it's kind of a potluck.  \\"Dead On Arrival\\" is a return to Gen X-style Idol with its pulsing drums and bass, sounding like a poppier cousin of the Pistol's \\"EMI\\" at parts.  The mid-paced \\"Nobody's Business\\" veers more towards pop rather than punk, and with its Van Halen-like synths and catchy vocal hooks, would've been a decent single, as would have \\"Shooting Stars.\\"  Other tracks like \\"Come On Come On\\" makes one think what Gen X could've done with this stuff, and \\"Hole In The Wall\\" is pure filler.<br /><br />\\"It's So Cruel\\" is a calm and quiet ballad, with the loungy sounds of the Stones' \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" coming through.  It also serves as a nice prelude to the final track, which is a familiar one-none other than Billy Idol's song with Generation X, \\"Dancing With Myself.\\"  It's by far the hardest driving track on here, a replacement for \\"Congo Man\\" that was on the original.  BTW, thanks to Eric Andrews for this bit of info.<br /><br />The album marked Idol's collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens, whose fiery and squealing guitar theatrics would prove invaluable on the hit Rebel Yell album, and producer Keith Forsey, who helmed Idol's albums through Charmed Life.  Idol's image had a lot going for him, that platinum spiked hair and that sneer that became his trademark.  But the music here, while uneven in consistency, showed promise, especially in the midnight hour.With Myself.\\"  It's by far the hardest driving track on here, a replacement for \\"Congo Man\\" that was on the original.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|How many 5-star reviews have I given?  Bloody few.<br /><br />I'd never heard of this show then one day I got a package from Amazon that a girlfriend had sent with the FIREFLY series inside. She loved it and was just sure I would, too.<br /><br />You know what? She was right. I had to fight to limit myself to one show a night, it was that good from show #1. I found myself amazed beyond understanding over a number of points: Like, why hadn't I heard of this show before? How can a TV SHOW be so damned good? Why on earth did Fox cancel it? Will they really do the movie or is this just wistful thinking on the part of the fans? I have no answers for you here.<br /><br />It begins with a song and a guitar, almost western sound, and very, very good. The voice, the song, both are perfect for the show. You see the ship and the sets and you have to be amazed at the quality. There is no down side here, unless you count the untimely demise of a great show. The American history reminders  are unmistakable. It's at the end of a terrible civil war, the Captain and his first mate, Zoe, were on the losing side. Now the whole 'verse is trying to rebuild and do the best they can. There is an old west feel with a new frontier. The bad guys are scary and the good guys have heart. There are no aliens.<br /><br />The actors are exceptional. I fell in love with the Zoe/Wash relationship. I liked Captain Mal Reynolds. All three characters are beautifully played. One of my favorite shows is the one where 'how' everyone came aboard. Jayne Cobb, the mercenary, was particularly good.<br /><br />Two things are certain here: 1)FIREFLY is worth every star I put up there and more. 2)When there is a movie made, I will see it on the big screen, then I WILL own it asap.
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is one of the best movies i have ever seen.....its not just your average teen flick with the one linear jokes and crude humour....its so much more.......this movie is really moving it takes time to develop the characters and you makes you care about them....another highlight is the music for this film it is catchy and great really captures the mood of the movie........This is a great film......don't listen to people who rip on it........just go with it...and buy this movie....you won't regret it

B000008LOV|5.0|If there is one thing that the 1980s music scene should be remembered for - it is the emergence of the \\"Supergroup\\".  A Supergroup is basically a group or project whose members were in other successful bands or established artists in their own right.   The mid 1980s saw the rise of groups like \\"The Power Station\\" (Robert Palmer, Tony Thompson of Chic, John and Andy Taylor of Duran Duran);  Mike + The Mechanics (Mike Rutherford from Genesis, Paul Carrack); General Public (Former English Beat Members Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger, Andy \\"Stoker\\" Growcott from Dexy's Midnight Runners).  However, possibly the biggest Supergroup that emerged in the late 1980s were The Traveling Wilburys.   The Wilburys boast what might be the strongest lineup any Supergroup ever had:  George Harrison from The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Jeff Lynne from ELO.    The Wilburys - formed by accident or not, had the talent base and the timing for such an effort.   Their debut effort - \\"Traveling Wilburys Volume 1\\" is reflective of both their talent and the times this collection was released. <br /> <br />Some say the Wilburys were formed by accident.   Some may say that Jeff Lynne isn't in the league of the other four Wilburys (I disagree).  It is perhaps Lynne that brought the Wilburys together.  Lynne was working with  Harrison who was making his \\"Cloud Nine\\" album.   Lynne was also working with Roy Orbison.   The story goes that Lynne, Harrison, and Orbison all agreed to sing on Orbison's song.   They needed a place to record, so they contacted Bob Dylan to use his studio.  Meanwhile word is that George's guitar was with Tom Petty (who was also working with Lynne).  The rest is history. <br /> <br />The Wilburys also came at the right time.  The 80s music landscape was undergoing a major transformation.  The Synth-Pop sound that had dominated the early 80s was now being replaced by a more natural, guitar-laden sound.  All five membersof the Wilburys are guitar players, so the fit and timing was right.   \\"Traveling Wilburys Volume 1\\" not only brings a strong guitar-laden sound, it also brings an acoustic spin.  There are also some studio musicians (sometimes called \\"The Sideburys\\" to provide Sax, Percussion, and Drum work). <br /> <br />The band took a very unconventional approach to this project.  For starters - on the liner notes, none of the members use their real name.  Each member takes an alias: Dylan (Lucky Wilbury), Petty (Charlie T Jr.), Orbison (Lefty Wilbury), Lynne (Otis Wilbury), and Harrison (Nelson Wilbury).  The term Wilbury was what Lynne and Harrison called some faulty recording equipment when George was recording \\"Cloud Nine\\".   In the liner notes, there is a fictional writeup telling the background of the Wilburys written by Monty Python's Michael Palin.  The result is a most unconventional album - but the formula works and is in sync with their music.   <br /> <br />The great thing about this collection is there are no bad songs. \\"Handle With Care\\" was the first single released from the collection.  Harrison has the lead vocals, but all five members do vocals.  The other single is \\"End of the Line\\" which features everyone on vocals but Dylan.  These songs are very good - they played well to the radio because of the hand-offs between the vocals.  However it is \\"Margarita\\" that might be the most interesting of all the songs that have hand-offs on lead vocals.  Most notably Dylan and Petty really shine.  \\"Margarita\\" is a song that has a bit of a techo rock sound, but also has a strong acoustic element. <br /> <br />\\"Dirty World\\" is perhaps the best track on this collection. Dylan does lead vocals on a very catchy song that just blows me away.  The other members provide some outstanding background vocals.   Listen to how studio musician Jim Horn's Sax folds in beautifully after Dylan sings a line.  This song has three parts.  The first is Dylan singing the main verse with Wilbury background vocals.  The second part is an exchange between Dylan singing lines and the others singing \\"He Loves Ya\\".   One of the lines Dylan signs is \\"Trembling Wilbury\\" which was the original name Harrison suggested for the band (word is Dylan came up with 'Traveling').  The final part is a harmony by everyone going \\"Dirty World, Dirty World\\". <br /> <br />Dylan also makes solid lead vocal contributions on \\"Congratulations\\" and \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\".  \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\" is another brilliant song about a  couple being chased down by an Undercover cop.  Dylan sings the song in the form of a narrative.  Like in \\"Dirty World\\", the other Wilburys provide some outstanding background vocals. <br /> <br />The other songs give the others an opportunity to do some lead vocals.  Harrison has lead vocals on \\"Heading For the Light\\".  The best way to describe this song is that it is a classic styled George Harrison song.  It has a Beatles-esque sound to it.   Jim Horn again provides some good Sax work.  The Roy Orbison lead vocals on  \\"Not Alone Any More\\" have a 60s music retro-feel to it.  Jeff Lynne provides lead vocals on \\"Rattled\\".  This is a nice song that has also has a retro sound. Petty does lead vocals on \\"Last Night\\" which seems like a cross between bluegrass and reggae.   <br /> <br />Although there would be another Wilburys album (1990's \\"Traveling Wilburys Volume 3\\" - there was no \\"Volume 2\\"), this would be the only collection with all five members.  Orbison would pass away unexpectedly in 1988 due to a Heart Attack.  The remaining four would go on to make that other album - and that would be the last effort of the Wilburys as a group.  Lynne would go on to produce 1989's \\"Full Moon Fever\\" for Tom Petty and it would feature Orbison and Harrison.  The sad thing is most of these songs are never done live. This is a hard album to find - if you can get it, you will more than get your money's worth.
068484267X|5.0|In Frank McCourt's compelling memoir Angela's Ashes he shares the story of his tragic childhood as his family battles the struggles of poverty. Frank's memoir of his childhood begins in Brooklyn, New York in 1935 when his mother, Angela, and his father, Malachy travel from Ireland in hopes of a better life. Frank was born out of wedlock, forcing his parents to eventually marry. Frank is raised in the house of a cigarette addicted mother and an alcoholic father, and is forced to take on many grueling responsibilities. Their family continues to grow, causing them to fall deeper into poverty.  The dreadful poverty and the devastating death of his sister, Margaret, eventually drove Frank and his now growing family back to Limerick, Ireland. In Ireland, Angela's mother bought them an apartment which eventually became their home. Frank and Malachy are enrolled in a Catholic school, where they are often tormented by the other boys for being less fortunate. The boys are not only looked down upon by their classmates, but also by the school masters. Frank's teachers chose to treat him inferior because of their lower social status. As Frank grows older more responsibility is placed upon him to raise his younger siblings. He is forced to lead his family as they beg for food and money from neighbors and church. Their poverty becomes even more serious as their father continues to throw their money away to satisfy his alcohol obsession. Frank is now old enough to hear his father stumble in at night belting Irish songs. He is old enough to hear is mother yelling and sobbing at her husband to become a respectable man and look after his failing family. Despite these late drunken nights, Frank remembers the stories his father shared with him when he was a young boy, and the lessons he instilled in him, trying to position that image over his now drunken father. His father then decides to move to England to work in the factories at the onset of World War II, hoping to earn money to support his family. As expected, he is unfaithful to his word and spends the little money he earns on drinks. The McCourt's are no longer able to pay their small rent, and are forced out of their apartment. Reluctantly, Angela's relatives offer to house the struggling family. At the age of fifteen, Frank has experienced far more then the average grown man and decides that it is time for change. He has lived through hunger, devastation, tears, and death and has witnessed his family fall to pieces. He is certain that this is not the way for him to live, and is ready to become an independent, self-sufficient man. To begin his path away from these horrors he finds a job as a mailman, hoping to someday earn the money to escape back to America.  <br /> Frank McCourt was able to open my eyes to the horrors and tribulations of poverty. The everlasting hardships told through the eyes of a young boy allowed me to realize the sincere pain that is experienced. As jobs were lost, and deaths occurred I fell deeper into the misery of the McCourt family. As I read through his life, both laughter and tears were shared. Frank McCourt told this novel using the first person, sharing his stories as if they were occurring for the first time. As he grew older and experienced greater troubles, his writing style became more serious. Although mostly a horrifying story, McCourt used a humorous style to express childhood memories to at times relive the reader from the sometimes upsetting stories. However, the visions of Frank's struggling family still linger in my mind.  \\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. <br />. . . nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.\\" <br />
0679735909|4.0|This novel truly is a work of art.  The book tells the story of a young scholar - Roland Mitchell - who learns that Randolph Ash, the author he has spent years studying, may have had a secret affair with poet Christabel LaMotte.  Ash was married - thought to be a caring, devoted husband - and LaMotte was believed to be single her entire life.  Roland digs through all sorts of correspondence all while dealing with personal problems with his own girlfriend and the difficulty of working with another scholar - a woman named Maud Bailey - who is difficult in her own right. <br /> <br />The book is beautifully written, particularly the poetry and other passages \\"written\\" by Ash and LaMotte.  It almost makes you wonder if the two people existed in real life!  That said, the book was a little bit too cerebral for me.  I wished at times that there was more action and less thought/conversation.  I appreciated how well-written the book is but did find my attention lagging at certain points.
0802130208|3.0|This book is often cited as a classic, expecially by people who live in New Orleans.  It is the story of the adventures of one Ignatius J. Reilly, a social misfit from Uptown New Orleans, and his interactions  with a bunch of stereotypical New Orleans characters. <br /> <br />This book is one of four books often mentioned as mandatory reading for anyone wanting to understand New Orleans  ( Incidentally, the other three are TN Williams' Streetcar Named Desire, Walker Percy's the Moviegoer, and Kate Chopin's The Awakening).  Many people love Confederacy, and many people, though probably not as many, don't.  After a second reading I confirmed my initial reaction and again firmly place myself in the \\"don't\\" category.  Undoubtedly, the book has some major things going for it ( as do most Pulitizer Prize winning novels ). Toole nails New Orleans cold.  The dialogue is great. <br />One might enjoy the novel if for no other reason than listening to Ignatius' mama and her friend, Santa, pass the time of day in conversation.  His depiction of Uptown New Orleans and the French Quarter are again right on the money.  As someone who lives in the Quarter, I especialy enjoyed his depiction of my neighborhood.  The plot comes together quite well.  But, God, I found  the characters, especially Ignatius, just horrible people without many redeeming social values at all.  And, after two readings with very few chuckles, I just don't get how so many readers think this is not only a laugh out loud novel, but maybe the greatest such novel ever written.  <br /> <br />But what do I know ?  What I do know is that my views are in the minority of New Orleanians. If you are planning to live in New Orleans, you better be familiar with this book, or else you won't be able to get a visa.
0553106635|5.0|I read through the first two books in this series, and was blown away.  Both of them were incredible.  But then I came here, and found myself forced to write 4-star reviews.  The books were better than many that I've given 5-star reviews to, but they were so ambitious that even a minor flaw cost them a star. <br /> <br />Then came \\"A Storm of Swords.\\"  Plot webs continued to weave, battles were fought, and the story continued to draw me in.  But for quite some time I felt that a new flaw had surfaced for this book: predictability.  Jaime's friendship with Brienne, and Sandor's with Arya, it seemed Martin had lost his ability to surprise.  But then within the last few hundred pages shocks began to reappear (no spoilers here), and I finally get the pleasure of writing a five-star review. <br /> <br />And to address the issue of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" taking too long, I don't care.  I'm glad Martin is taking his time producing another masterpiece, instead of a work of pulp.  Time is one major difference between the original, masterful \\"Dune\\" series, and the new, fun but pulpy, \\"Dune\\" prequels.  If I have to wait fifty years to get AFFC, I will.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|I saw Star Wars in the cinema on its original release in 1977 and I was not slow to buy a ticket for an encore. The sheer experience of that film was exhilerating at a time when movie SFX were still a fair distance away from the quality we know and expect today. Few cinemas had stereo sound then because Dolby Stereo was in its infancy, and to actually be in a cinema so equipped at that time was a rarity. If you were really lucky, in addition to Dolby stereo, it might have a 70mm facility which would give you an enhanced picture, plus a 6 channel stereo split instead of the normal 4 channel of standard Dolby. Nowadays digital stereo in the cinema and home makes that sort of differentiating pretty irrelevent.<br /><br />Seeing Star Wars in stereo and with its incredible effects really was an experience . After that sound and SFX were never going to be the same, and neither have looked back since.<br /><br />Only just behind The Empire Strikes Back in terms of enjoyability sits Star Wars itself. The film remains one of those viewing experiences which just remains in your mind as a milestone. What effects, what imagination, the ability to lift you out of every day life and take you to a galaxy, far, far away. Who can forget seeing that opening shot of the huge Star Destroyer bearing down on Princess Leia's fleeing vessel?<br /><br />No audiences had seen spaceships of those looks and dimensions on the big screen before...<br /><br />The seedier side of intergalactic life is brilliantly realised in the depiction of THAT bar on the desert planet of Tatooine.<br /><br />Of course you have that unforgettable sequence at the end of the film where a horde of tiny X Wing fighters take on the behemoth that is the Empire's Death Star.<br /><br />Aside from the main characters you have great supporting roles. Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi is superb. As is Peter Cushing as the ruthless Governor Tarkin, commanding the Death Star.<br /><br />As to the controversy of the editing that Lucas has made to the dvd releases, my feelings are as follows:<br /><br />I loved the originals and have the vhs versions of all three. However, with nearly 20 years between Jedi and The Phantom Menace there were always going to be continuity issues concerning casting and SFX. Play an original vhs version of Star Wars, and you will soon see that the mattes have not aged well and stand out visibly. Yet did we notice them at the the time of the films release? No of course not because the SFX then were state of the art. Now with the passage of time and SFX having come on in leaps and bounds, George Lucas decided to update the former films.In my opinion he has done a good job too SFX wise. The casting editing is more to link with the newer editions of the franchise than to improve the quality of the originals, so my thoughts on that are mixed though. I can see the reason for doing it but I simply prefer the original actors in their roles. Clive Revill's Emperor in Empire Strikes Back I think is the deletion that was most unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall though I am glad that I have a choice and can either watch the originals on vhs or put on the updated versions on dvd.<br /><br />I have looked forward to the dvd release of these films for years and am delighted with finally being able to blast them across my home cinema set up. The picture on 16:9 anamorphic is great on a widescreen tv. All sound channels are crisp and totally clear of any distortion. Laser blasts and Tie Fighters shoot across the room to varying degrees...Such is the effect of being able to do that, it has returned me to the awe struck kid seeing Star Wars for the first time in a cinema. Thanks for the dvds, George, it may have taken a while but at least they are here now.to the dvd releases, my feelings are as follows:  <br />I loved the originals and have the vhs versions of all three.

B00004Y6OA|5.0|This has got to be Van Halen's most solid effort. All the songs on this disc just rock from beginning to end. One of their most diverse discs. The song writing and over all playing on this record is outstanding. You got Alex Van Halen's Thunderous style drum playing and Eddie's screaming guitar work along with David Lee and Michael Anthony filling in all the gaps perfectly. <br />ALSO CORRECTION TO CHRIS BICKEL: David Lee Roth was in Van Halen for 10 years; 74-84 not 78-83. I have a bootleg of VH playing Pasadena High School in 75.
B00005JLK0|3.0|Ghost ship, brings to the screen the story of a salvage crew as it stumbles across an abandoned Italian cruise ship, in the vicinity of the Bering Sea, that has gone missing since 1962. <br />The major setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it), which is just average, while the choice for lead actress was poor at best; this film does not seem to be her thing. She is unrealistically \\"tough\\" and not very likable.  Overall, she is not convincing in her role.   <br />Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues, for which the writers are to blame. <br />Aside from that, the setting and the plot are pretty good! <br />The film combines drama, action, and adventure making it rather enjoyable, as long as you're in that kind of a mood.   <br />
1401301363|5.0|I have to say, living in the UK, as I do, I am slighty envious of the American frontcover of this book since it features the lovely Ms Lawson (she is stunningly beautiful afterall!)<br /><br /> The British version has a very artistic photograph of an aluminium steamer pot, in a very rustic setting, no Nigella!<br /><br /> I guess now that Nigella is married to the most prolific British art collector, it's little wonder.<br /><br /> That is is one of my few complaints about his book. It is beautifully structured, expertly researched and the recipes are not only catatonia inducingly yummy but Nigella's dialogue about them is as sintilating and seductive as ever she is.<br /><br /> What I liked so much also was that she had tried to include a wide denomination of festivals and feasts. Not all are featured, obvoiusly, the book would take eons to produce otherwise. For my own part I was a little dissapointed that Diwali was overlooked (the Hindu festival of lights) largely becuase I live in a part of Britain which has a huge Diwali festival and I have always wanted to make some of those lovely savoury and sweet nibbles (I'll research what actress and cook Madhur Jaffrey has on this and report back!) Nonetheless I was enthralled with the reach of her knowledge and it was every bit as intriging to find out about feasts I have never been to as it was to salivate on food ideas. Even slime soup is georgous and Children will love the gorily named menu!<br /><br /> Feast is a great cook book and won't gather dust in your Kitchen. Nigella's food is always sumptious and utterly delicious, check out her ham cooked in Coca Cola - sublime!<br /><br /> Just for the record, to my American cousins who may not be able to figure the lumping together of Thanksgiving and Christmas, I suspect it is because the traditional British Christmas Lunch is incredibly similair to the US Thanksgiving Dinner. Another hit from Nigella and I don't think it will spend anytime in the shadow of her other works.
079213690X|5.0|Definitely a great epic movie, Braveheart, brings to the screen the story of the Scot hero William Wallace, as he seeks revenge against the English for the killing of his wife and family, and the freedom of his country. <br />Braveheart combines drama, action, adventure, even humor, making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical films after a long dormant period. <br />Needless to say, Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Catherine McCormack, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! <br />The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />Love, Honor, Battles, and swordfights are all about.   <br />In short, it is a movie worth watching! <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|De-loused in the Comatorium is a CD that will not be easily forgotten. Combining several rock, jazz, and Latin influences while innovating a unique style that is all their own, The Mars Volta have created a musical masterpiece for their first full-length album release that displays both technical agility and sheer creative genius. As innovative thematically as it is musically, De-loused in the Comatorium centers around the story of a man taking a spiritual journey while comatose, having just attempted an unsuccessful suicide. Throughout the album, the protagonist ponders his and others' actions and purposes in a world of surreal images of ant people, demonic statues, and a council of testing inner spirits, leading up to his eventual awakening from the coma and a second (here, successful) suicide attempt.    Songs like \\"Inertiatic ESP\\" are automatically accessible for their high energy vocals and guitar work which contain elements of both tension and excitement. However there are few moments on the album that require more than one listen to appreciate. Many people, after a single play, become completely hooked. Music buffs should also come to appreciate the talent behind Th Mars Volta's principal music writers, Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez of At the Drive-In, for the intense rhythms and tonal complexities that occur alongside a chain of transmuting sounds throughout each supernatural piece.     The song lyrics are characteristically strange and loveable, albeit hard to interpret. But the phantasmagoric images they paint begin to make sense as one is drawn into the eyes of the comatose man, Cerpin Taxt. One of The Mars Volta's biggest appeals to their die-hard fans is often the amount of heavy analysis that is attempted in deciphering Bixler's lyrics, albeit that it is rarely a fruitful endeavor without taking creative liberties with one's imagination.    I would recommend this album to anyone looking for something new to enlighten and inspire them. In a time where we could all use something a lot less cookie cutter, The Mars Volta have truly delivered the goods.
B0006H328E|5.0|I didn't know if this DVD was going to be a good buy, but I have no regrets.  It's even amusing just for the fact the Turtles end up fighting alongside a couple old enemies, though the episodes are quite enjoyable.  There were a few parts they could have been a little more subtle on, but they did clear up at least one hanging plotline from the Secret Origins episodes and all in all this was a genuiunly fun purchase.
0441003257|5.0|SYNOPSIS:<br />The Antichrist is coming. The world's about to end. The only problem is the \\"rank and file\\" angels and demons (who've begun to enjoy each other's company and understand each other over the eons) aren't so sure they want Armageddon to come.<br /><br />MY TAKE:<br />I'll keep this short. I adore Douglas Adams and the twisted wry humour found in both his \\"Hitchhiker's Trilogy\\" and the books of the Dirk Gently series. The blurb said it was similar. I gave it a try. It was.<br /><br />You will especially enjoy this if you have:<br />1) a DECENT working knowledge of Christianity (to get some of the subtle digs)<br />2) a knowledge of pop culture depictions of evil (the Exorcist movies and the like)<br />3) the ability to laugh at your own religious perspectives<br /><br />I consider myself an evangelical and thought this was laugh out loud outrageous.

0380789019|4.0|Neil Gaiman is a very artful storyteller, with just enough wit to make you smile, but never so much that it takes away from his plot or characters. In that sense, I do believe he finally outshines Douglas Adams who was always most concerned about dazzling with cleverness. <br /> <br />This novel is hard to put down. When you're done, you will have fallen in love with the characters and wish that there was a sequel for you to follow their continuing adventures. The style is clean and direct, the tone something like a Tim Burton production--colorful and interesting and slightly sinister. <br /> <br />For fans of fun stories, endearing characters and wry humor, this is for you. Also highly recommended are the aforementioned Douglas Adams and Robert Asprin.
B00005QENZ|2.0|As many have pointed out, these are very slickly produced and radio ready, which is fine if there's substance under the veneer. Sometimes there is, but more often there isn't. The album is definitely at its strongest in the first half where nearly all the best songs reside.<br /><br />\\"Eat the Rich\\" is a fabulous screed against the high and mighty, \\"Get a Grip\\"'s rapid-fire chorus sticks in your brain, and \\"Livin' on the Edge\\" was deservedly a radio hit (although, in the end, his message is a bit fuzzy. The first part obviously lambasts racists, but in the section where he says there's something RIGHT with the world today, he never lets you in on what the 'good thing' is. And even when he's saying we're 'on the edge', he seems to lampoon the notion at the same time with the 'Chicken Little' reference, so I'm not sure ultimately what the song's about..)<br /><br />After this, things go downhill in a hurry. The theme of \\"Flesh\\" has been done over and over by the band and usually much better, \\"Shut Up and Dance\\" doesn't inspire any hoofing, and \\"Gotta Love it\\" is downright insipid. \\"Cryin'\\" is the only bright spot in the 2nd half of the disc...a nice bluesy ballad that became one of the CD's hits. The Stephen Tyler harmonica solo really kicks this one into overdrive.<br /><br />\\"Amazing\\" COULD have been one of Tyler's best songs ever. It's certainly probably his most introspective and meaningful lyric, but the music just isn't up to snuff to accompany it.<br /><br />This is certainly one that has a few choice moments and lots of bland bits in between.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars
B00005A8GY|2.0|It's foolish to make an stereo version if you already have the multitrack sessions to make the 5.1 version. <br />Is it a matter of money, time, I can't understand,it's a full waste of resources.  <br />Buy the DTS version, you won't be dissapointed.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Based on the charming true-life book by Helene Hanff, 84 Charing Cross Road is an absolute heart-tugging gem of a movie, and I cannot believe I never came across this 1987 sleeper before this time. Anne Bancroft is magnificent as brash New Yorker Helene Hanff, a book lover extraordinaire who comes across a British emporium of rare books, and begins an extraordinary correspondence (via paper, this was BEFORE e-mail and how charming it is!) with  Frank Doel, played fabulously by a young Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />Somehow, in their 20 years of correspondence about books, their growing and deep friendship never had its denoument: Neither one was ever able to visit the other. And yet they were extraordinarily close in their mutual love of books, as Hanff's prolific reading habits and exacting demands for unabridged material complimented Doel's understated British desire to help her all he could.<br /><br />I found myself in tears more than once; there are so many subtleties to this movie, especially in the bravira performance by Bancroft. This may be her finest role, unheralded though it was.<br /><br />Something wonderful for any book lover. Order it and enjoy!

B00007K02F|2.0|I have seen several versions of this novel and this one has not done justice at all to the character of Jane Eyre by casting Charlotte Gainsbourg as the lead role.  She looks too young (not 18 but 15), too depressed and not at all passionate as Jane should be.  William Hurt is tolerable and although he is too mellow being Mr. Rochester, it seemed that he had tried hard to create some kind of chemistry between himself and Gainsbourg.  I wonder if Charlotte Gainsbourg got this role because of her father being a famous composer.   At the end of the movie, I almost felt sorry for Rochester being end up with such a depressed, cold, and dispirited girl!
B000002LEU|5.0|As stated in my title, Substance is indeed a worthy companion piece to Joy Division's two classic, timeless masterpieces: Closer and Unknown Pleasures, and that is about the highest compliment that I can pay this singles collection.<br /><br />If you're familiar with their two albums (and if you're not, you oughta be!), you may be surprised to find how un-Joy Divisionian this sounds.  The sound is still dark and minimalist, but most of these songs (especially the earliest ones) are surprisingly up-tempo and punky.  Substance serves as a reminder that yes, Joy Division really did form after seeing the Sex Pistols play, and yes, this is definitely a singles collection.  It, of course, doesn't pack the emotional wallop of Closer (as if anything can) or the masterful cohesiveness of Unknown Pleasures, but hey, singles collections aren't supposed to be breathtaking albums.  For what it is, Substance is nothing short of top-notch.<br /><br />The first ten tracks are what truly justify your purchase of Substance.  From the stark punk of \\"Warsaw\\" and \\"Digital,\\" to the gorgeous and appropriately titled \\"Atmosphere,\\" to the classics \\"Transmission\\" and \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\\" to the ferociously bleak \\"Autosuggestion,\\" the main section of Substance covers all of the band's various sounds and styles beautifully.  Not enough can ever be said about these songs and their individual significance.  Especially notable is that these are, for the most part, songs that were supposed to appeal to the masses, appease radio stations, and \\"move units\\" per se.  The fact that Joy Division could manage all three while creating true art is only one of the many facets of the band's genius.<br /><br />The appendix of Substance is mostly made up of more of their earliest, punk-influenced singles.  Though mostly fine takes on punk, the songs on the appendix simply can't compare to the first ten.  \\"Failures,\\" a mediocre Damned rip-off, perfectly represents the stale, uninspired side of Joy Division that rarely reared its ugly head, but did so enough.<br /><br />Don't let some of the filler turn you off to this, though.  Substance is absolutely essential for all fans of Joy Division and any form of alternative music (punk, post-punk, indie, etc.), but if you're new to JD, certainly pick up the two albums first.ivision that rarely reared its ugly head, but did so enough.   <br /> <br />Don't let some of the filler turn you off to this, though.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I must say, I was a bit hesitant about this film when I saw the horrible previews for it when it came out in the theater. It deterred me even more when I saw the \\"MTV Films\\" logo jump into the screen at the beginning. But to my surprise, Napoleon Dynamite turned out to be a smart, and uniquely funny independent film.<br /><br />You can't help but feel pity for most of the characters in this film. Uncle Rico's delusional dreams of being an all-star quarterback circa 1982. Pedro, the quiet pinata smashing Mexican, or poor Deb, who's just trying to raise money for college. Kip (Napoleon's Brother) is one of the stranger characters in the film, who seems to be gay, but is in love with LaFawnduh, a voluptuous black woman he met over the internet. For whatever reason, these characters are very appealing to the average movie watcher.<br /><br />Although the movie has little to no plot, it doesn't pale in originality. So many of the jokes are different, dry and satirical, that some of them slip through the cracks. This film is great for repeat watching, just because it is so unique, and so many of the jokes are like \\"What!?\\"; it just makes you want to see them again. I would say that young geeks like myself would like this movie the most, but it seems that geeks of all ages relate to the movie equally. I would go as far as to say that non-geeks would look down on, or feel pity for the characters enough to chuckle at. Hands down, a hilarious film!
B000001GK9|5.0|There certainly are some hyperbolic reviews of this recording here. I suspect that many of those who don't like this performance really just don't like Karajan, because of his past poliltical affiliations, or whatever: I don't really want to go \\"down that road,\\" except to say that it's difficult to judge someone's personal decisions unless one was there in the same historical time and place. I find it preplexing when people write reviews that have less to do with the quality of a performance and recording, than with their personal feelings about a performer. Now, on to this performance of Mahler's Ninth. <br /> <br />I spent several years back in the late 'Eighties and early 'Nineties--when Mahler's symphonies were enjoying a bit of a \\"digital renaissance\\"--steeped in these works, and I finally got to the point when many recordings were just a bit too histrionic for me, emphasizing the dynamic contrasts so as to bring out tne too-well-documented neurotic quality of Mahler and his music. Some of Bernstein's readings fall into this category, although his later recordings of the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and the BPO Ninth are among my very favorites. <br /> <br />Karajan's Mahler may not have the dynamic contrasts that some have, but it is powerful and satisfying in its own way...and this particular ninth is certainly not lacking in intensity, esp. in the outer movements. While it's true that most of the recordings of Karajan's last 15-20 years were not among his best, this ninth is definitely one of his greatest recorded performances. <br /> <br />The recording is not perfect, sometimes even sounding like it's about to \\"split at the seams\\" in some places, like at the intense final climax of the slow finale...but it is the very immediacy of the recording that helps to emphasize the glowing intensity of the outer movements. The inner movements may be a little cool, compared to some performances--I have even found myself occasionally substituting Bernstein's inner movements--but it is the first and fourth movements, and their cataclysmic climaxes that define this performance, and make it one of the best Mahler Ninths, even if other recordings are more \\"idiomatic Mahler readings.\\" As an aside, if you are into gongs, the gong smash at the final climax of the first movement is one of the most powerful on record.

1400032717|5.0|I had seen this book on the stacks at my local warehouse store for several weeks, and finally the impulse to give this book a try won out.  And happily so.  This book was the perfect antidote to my winter reading logjam, with four or five books started and none of them compelling enough for me to read all the way through. <br /> <br />\\"The Curious Incident...\\" gets your attention from the beginning, not because it starts with the murder of Christopher's neighbor's dog, Wellington, but because of the protagonist himself.  The 226 pages of the paperback edition are a marvel of character as we see the world through Christopher's autistic eyes.  Haddon never lets the pacing lag, but his true mastery is in finding perfect pitch in Christopher's voice, and never letting it slip.   <br /> <br />My initial trepidation, in thumbing through the book, was that it was merely another \\"gimmick\\" novel that so many trendy writers of fiction ply in place of actual craft.  I can't tell you how bored I am with books that are novelties without ever being novels: books that are over-long just to prove a point, or ones that use clever tricks like copious footnotes or diagrams or visuals that do little besides trumpet authorial genius, ad nauseam.  While \\"The Curious Incident...\\" has a strikingly different narrative psychology, and the protagonist does in fact use footnotes and diagrams, this book never swerves into gimmickry. <br /> <br />It may not be much of a mystery.  I had figured out who killed Wellington and the truth about Christopher's mother well in advance of Christopher's revelation, but here again it is Haddon's well-spun tale that gives the reader the clues to figure this out, without being too obvious or making Christopher seem too one-dimensional.  And the second part of the story, the London trip, may not have enough variation of plot to satisfy every reader, but let's not miss the point. <br /> <br />The point is not the autistic-as-oddity, or the mystery of who killedWellington, or the trip to London.  This is a story that has as its theme the idea of personal growth, and Christopher's growth here is enormous, all the more so given his circumstances.  The ending offers a promise of happiness for his family, without being too neatly wrought or too saccharine, and the reader feels that Christopher himself has grown from a child who could not possibly lead an independent life to a person who could be both independent and productive. <br /> <br />This book was a quick but satisfying read.  It satisfied both in the sense that one wants to just pick up a book that's a good, if surprising, read.  But as well, one looks for something deeper than \\"things happening on the page,\\" and Haddon has simply nailed it: his character is so artistically wrought that I wanted to know what happened to him next.  (Not that Haddon should ruin this fine book with a sequel, it's just the sign of a good book that one wants it to go on!)  As I thought about this in the days after finishing it, I found it a subtle musing on how we all face challenges and our own journeys of growth.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This has to be one of the best Cd's put out this year. A Perfect circle came on the scene with Mer De Noms and tore it up. But with 13th Step they paved there way as a band with \\"Staying Power\\". One word to sum this disc up, \\"Spectacular\\"
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I was planning to be mildly amused as the White Stripes played and the credits began to roll (listed on items of food...well, you have to see it to understand) and so began the movie \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\".   It is not your typical \\"teen nerd gets revenge on the cool kids\\" fare.  The main character, Napoleon, is not a doormat for anyone and truly lives his life without needing acceptance.  His friends Pedro and Deb are also very interesting characters, along with Napoleon's quirky family.  You never quite know why certain things in the film are repeated (did someone say, tater tots?) but it all makes sense in the end.  \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" does not deserve the teenage film category, for it is way too intelligent and not \\"schlocky\\".  If you want a great time, put this on your \\"must see\\" list!!! <br /> <br />[Review by D.M. Kling]
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Troy does a wonderful job of retelling Homer's epic.  While it does not play verbatim to The Illiad (and how could it?), it stays true to the spirit of the work.  By eliminating the petty squabbles of the gods and providing a more believable (if not more historically accurate) portrayal of the fall of Troy, we can focus more intently on the characters.  Both Pitt and Bana are superb as Achilles and Hector, and the final fight between the two is both gorgeous and tragic as both their fates are sealed.
B000063KG6|3.0|Stonedhenge-- is a very hard Cd to rate. So I will attempt to offer my thoughts and opinions for any curious buyers. <br />The musicianship is Excellent !! {5 stars} <br />The production and sound quality is Superior !! {4 stars} <br />But, where this album fails is in the song writing and in the continuity of how each flows together. The songs are very scattered. Stonedhenge, gives us the trade mark blues rock Ten Years After we are familiar with. Then all of sudden the next song is classical piano piece, then comes a jazz piece, then comes a wierd version of the kiddie nursery ryhme \\"Three Blind Mice\\" which is played strictly on the drums. \\"Now\\" can you see what I mean. Stonedhenge is literally a musical experiment. <br />If you prefer a very different style of songwriting with a flair for the odd than this will surely capture your interest. <br />From a musicianship stand piont this is a work of art. <br />From a songwriting stand piont this is not the normal Ten Years After. Thus the 3 stars rating. <br />Song variations to consider are: <br />\\"Gonna Try\\"-- A blues rock song that contains a couple tempo changes and an odd use of some bongos towards the end. On the plus side is some spectacular Keyboard playing. <br />\\"I Cant Live Without Lydia\\"-- A very short 1:20 minute piano extravaganza that borders on classical. <br />\\"Woman Trouble\\"-- Solid jazz feel going on. Smooth vocals,Excellent Hammond organ playing and solo as well as an awesome guitar solo. Snare drum technique is impressive. Extra crisp ride cymbal sound. <br />\\"Hear Me Calling\\"-- A jazz shuffle with driving boogie woogie Bass guitar patterns.Nice two part vocal harmonys. <br />\\"A Sad Song\\"-- More Blues happening here. Reverb effect on the vocals adds a hint of the mystery to this one. Guitar solo included. <br />\\"Three Blind Mice\\"-- All drums playing the theme of Three Blind Mice. A short little diddy at that !! <br />\\"No Title\\"-- Basically a seven minute blues rock jam session. Creative drums. Guitar and keyboards work into a frenzy towards the ending. <br />\\"Faro\\"-- A 1:09 minute Bass Solo. <br />\\"Speed Kills\\"-- The last track is a fast shuffle. Boogie woogie bass and Ryhthmic guitar work. Unbelievable snare drum roll technique !! Clean sounding jazz style gutar solo !! <br /> <br />Final thought: Stick with A Space In Time or Cricklewood Green for a more familiar Ten Years After. However, if you prefer the different experimenting style of Ten Years After then by all means \\"Buy It\\". Songs are still somewhat out of context in my opinion.
B00068IOWC|1.0|yet some brianwashed fans are very determined to like this new \\"U2\\" bulls**t, what a shame.  <br />The whole CD is too much of the same mainstream radio-friendly stuff once again. <br /> <br />Somehow, the men in U2 have managed to record an album that is even worse than ATYCLB. I guess that is impressive. What disappoints about HTDAAB it's just extremely unremarkable and forgettable. Hit and Miss, that's all. The band sounds like their trying to catch ATYCLB sound again, and Bono doesn't sound like he's in good voice. He just ruins everything with such an awful singing. The outcome ? The most unoriginal, pathetic, annoying, commercial, pointless and lame album U2 ever made. They just sound like crap here. Tired, bored, uninspired, this is a painful listening. Songwriting is really shameful.  <br /> <br />I don't know why they really believed these 'songs' would be good enough for a U2 ALBUM. They really believed their hype and all that s**t. This garbage has no substance. The whole album is barely listenable, after the annoying 'Sometimes You can't make it on your own' I turn it off. Pitful. Telling their fans that they were 'returning to their roots' and using a great album like War as a template brought about a great deal of hype for this album which I think U2 have become. They really don't care about their real fans by putting out an album as bad as this. <br /> <br />This is EASILY U2's worst album ever. Period. They have deteriorated since ATYCLB, and apparently aren't going to reboound anytime soon. Overall, it is sad to see this once-brilliant band now resigned to pounding on their instruments monotonously, as if they really don't know what else to do.  <br />This mainstream U2( 2000-present ) are just dragging down U2's legacy. It's just sad.  <br /> <br />PLEASE U2 RETIRE, THANKS. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000G3I2|5.0|As a 1971 graduate of a student movement campus, I feel for the characters in this movie.  The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor was one such campus, and all the characters in this movie are alumni from there. <br /> <br />In 1969 they thought their parents and authority figures were wrong about everything.  They thought formal clothing was wrong.  They thought Time Life publications were full of baloney. <br /> <br />Now, in 1983, these Ann Arbor alumni dress formally, especially if they're going to a funeral.  And one of the gang writes for People Weekly, the Time Life publication. <br /> <br />I'm a writer myself.  I do my best to revive late 60's New Left political arguments on my web site: <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />The ex - flower children in \\"The Big Chill\\" ponder their transformation into the people they used to hate, the people they once accused of killing the Kennedys.   <br /> <br />Not only that, they also hear their biological clocks ticking.  They try playing touch football only to wince at the injuries they likely will sustain from a single game.  The character played by Mary Kay Place realizes she soon will become unable to bear children.  The character of Alex, though never seen, haunts a group of his friends throughout the film.  He has chosen to follow the advice of Pete Townshend and die before he gets old. <br /> <br />Group members revisit their erstwhile promises to help every single African American and Latino kid in the slums.  Mary Kay Place's character broaches this subject.  She is an attorney working in real estate law in the Atlanta area.  When we first meet her we see her luxurious office with a beautiful view out the window.   <br /> <br />She explains to the group that she switched to this lucrative field after becoming frustrated as a public defender in the juvenile court system of Philadelphia.  She became frustrated there after realizing that the kids wanted to commit crimes instead of receive charity.  They chose to hurt people.  So it was time for her to do what she wanted to do. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie, you should see it.  You can't change the world as a few college students in 1969 wanted to do, but you can cry with those people as they grieve the shattering of their hope.  The only possible sequel to this movie would take place in the year 2020 as the characters join the Grey Panthers.  At that point they'll have to fight just to survive. Forget the Peace Corps.  Their own survival (meals, medical care, etc.) will become paramount. <br /> <br />

B00003CY0V|4.0|Okay, having read other reviews, I'm wondering at the relative IQ level or at least how slow to pickup and follow plot twists.  The plot was easy to follow for me, I understood the whole misdirection thing and was even surprised once or twice when \\"I didn't see that coming\\" was appropriate.      Yes, they gave Hugh Jackman's hacker character WAY too much luck/skill; i.e. a 60 sec hack into a high level government system with NO prep, NO plan and what amounts to a PC DOESN'T happen, gun-to-his-head or no.  Even hackers with photographic memories keep notes and need time.  The addition of CRAY servers or multiple Dell systems would help process faster, but wouldn't make Hugh Jackman any more powerful, just faster (surface level).  The addition of Stanley's daughter being used as incentive for him to do his deed was alright to add some depth; personally, I'd like to have seen his loss of an ex-wife get used as such, then, right before he breaks the code, she gets killed (an interesting twist and no loss to the gene pool).    Halle Barry's nude scene was definitely (as defined by the dictionary) gratuitous, but it didn't offend me as a fan.  Like, I wasn't thinking \\"AW COME ON, THEY DID THAT FOR THE RATINGS ONLY!\\".  It was a flash of what the fans wanted to see and didn't instantly turn the character or the actress into a whore.      John Travolta's character was (and I'm no expert here) a fresh concept, and well played by the actor.  An anti-terrorist willing to sacrifice lives for the greater good isn't something that jumps out at me as \\"been there, done that\\".  The movie ended with news clips of international terrorists being killed off by Gabriel (or whatever his name turned out to be).  I'd like something like THAT to happen in reality: a non-governmental agency killing off enemies of the U.S. (or anyone, as terrorists are slugs) without causing an international incident or anti-U.S. sentiment.      But that's an opinion ... actually this whole thing is an opinion.So take it for what it's worth, but watch/rent the movie once and form your own, buy if you liked it.  [...]

B0001BKAEE|3.0|it seems like The Wachowski Brothers forced us an ending in which we are not very satisfyed but it is still pretty damn entertaining. Keanu Reeves (upcoming Constantine, The Watcher) once again returns as Neo who is stuck in a train station...kinda the Wachowski brothers version of limbo I guess in which he is trapped and cant get out. Trinity, Carrie Ann-Moss (Red Planet, Chocolat) and Laurence Fishburne (Assault Of Precinct 13, Mystic River) return as Trinity and Morpheus as they race to rescue Neo. They accomplish their missing but Neo must go on his own to machine city where he must fight his final battle with Agent Smith, Hugh Weaving (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Priscilla Queen Of The Desert), so he wont take over the matrix and get out into zion. Trinity goes along for the ride but things soon happen as someone is already on the ship and he is possessed by Agent Smith...so Neo gets his eyes burnt off but he kills the intruder. Meanwhile, Morpheus and his crew....includes Link, played by Harold Perrineau Jr (Tv's OZ, Tv's Lost) and Niaobi, Jada Pinkett Smith (Collateral, Demon Knight) who  race back to zion because the sentinels have breached and are inside while the inside are trying to fight them off as best as they can. Action galore with a weak story following the grande of what Reloaded was. it seriously could of been a lot better. the climatic fight battle with Neo and Agent Smith would be the highlight. Marcy Alice plays the oracle replacing Gloria Foster who passed away while these films were in project. Also starring Lambert Wilson (Timeline), Harry Lennix (RAY, The Human Stain, Since You've Been Gone) and Gina Torres (Tv's Angel, Tv's Firefly).
B00008S2VG|5.0|You know, I never really liked \\"Like a Prayer\\", \\"Vogue\\", and all of Madonna's minor hits that barely broke onto the charts. But with the release of \\"American Life\\", I finally can say that I became a true Madonna fan. The first half of the album isn't as good as it could be, with the typical overproduced dance songs that Madonna is known for. The one standout track is \\"American Life\\", where Madonna does what she was always born to do: rap. Madonna has such a natural flow, I'm shocked that she didn't have duets with Dem Franchize Boyz and Public Enemy on her album! The real masterpiece is the second half of the album, though. Madonna cuts through the production and does what most of her fans have been waiting for; she sings with nothing supporting her but an acoustic guitar. It was truly brilliant to cut out the instruments that hide Madonna's vocal flaws, because now we can appreciate her voice for its shaky quality. Pitch doesn't matter as much, nor should it. I think Madonna took a page from Lumidee's book, as Madonna is always correctly riding from big trend to big trend. The only difference is that singing a little bit off key isn't just a trend... it has inspired legions of new musical artists, and Madonna will always be remembered as one of the biggest forces that brought this about. On \\"American Life\\", Madonna makes it obvious that her true fans never liked her for the boundaries she pushed in regards to sexuality or for the throbbing dance hits that she released. For true fans, it's always been about that angelic voice.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|with its beginning that pulled me in and then the end where it all blasted out. good battle sequences and great acting especially by Russell Crowe, hes a dynamite actor, an actor ahead of his game id say. beautiful and dizzingy camera shots and directed with ease by Peter Weir(Witness, The Truman Show). though there are some predictable parts like when Paul Bettany(the doctor) trys to find his bird and I knew the french ship was gonna be there. other parts like when the doctor got shot was a surprise. and what the heck is this I read about this is a sequel to Pirates Of The Carribean..its not people and its not a ripoff either. Pirates of The Carribean is a ride at Disneyworld and dont get me wrong its a frickin great movie but Master and Commander is like book 1 of the other 20 books in the series and the book is like the movie.
B00007GZQI|4.0|As many times as I've seen this film - and it's more than I can recall - I've never grown tired of it. Without a doubt, I'd rank this right up there with \\"Blazing Saddles,\\" \\"Little Big Man\\" and \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" as a contender for funniest movie of the last forty or fifty years.  And like those its social comment is still relevant.  The hunting scene is akin to the charge of the scarecrow in \\"Singing Detective\\" - unexpected, over the top and outrageously funny.  The scenes with Yule Brenner and the two body-builder dancers outdo any smack at homophobia I've seen since and are worth the price of this movie alone. Raquel Welch's bit part is priceless. The only thing keeping me from giving this more than a four-star rating is its lack of any extras, but then who needs 'em? Do yourself a favor and see \\"The Magic Christian.\\"
B000002JR8|5.0|Brutal, metal thrash at its finest.  Outstanding tunes to work out to.  Highly recommended as a cheap way to work out your aggressions.
0803729227|5.0|This book is absolutely fabulous. My 4-year old loves whales and marine life, so a whale and a snail having an adventure was right up her alley. The language is beautiful and easy for my 8 year old to read. I would recommend this book to any parent--it also has the \\"fable\\" to it of the small helping the large, when the snail helps the whale who's beached himself.
B00023B1LC|4.0|Exciting film. Especially loved the scene where Matt Damon must color and cut his girlfriend's hair, to disguise her appearance. He hacks away with a pair of kitchen scissors and she winds up looking like something from the pages of Vogue. Then they make love, to celebrate her new look. What a man! He speaks ten languages, knows all kinds of spooky martial arts moves, lives in a fab Paris apartment with a kitchen full of awesome appliances, AND he can style hair. What are they teaching government assassins these days?! And where can I meet one? <br /> <br />Julia Stiles doesn't do much in this film except stand around looking pouty, because she didn't get any haircut at all.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|Besides the quality of the music being dull, ordinary, run-of-the-maill dance/pop, JLo CANNOT SING!  Her delivery is bland without a touch of emotion.  Recently I spoke with someone who has worked on the sound engineering for her recordings and he said that the technology that is usually used to smooth over slight vocal imperfects (minor bleeps & glitches) they used on her voice to correct all over the map, up to an entire note.  The fact that someone like this has a career in music is astounding and disgraceful. When there are people who have real talent out there and are struggling and who will never be heard on the radio, JLo has made a singing career out of low-cut dresses and a big booty.
B000035P5E|5.0|Consider the possibilities : a super cold German Agent stranded to an unknown territory and  a sexually frustrated and orphan love will meet in this state of things.<br /><br />Magnificent and towering acting of Sutherland.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Progressive rock in general tends to attract comments such as pretentious, bombastic and self-indulgent.  This CD shows little reluctance to refrain from these appellations.  The length of the music, the threading of the elements into a complex tapestry, the effusive explosion of ecstatic instrumental energy and alternating between obscure lyrics and descriptions with moments of diamond clarity come together to provide fodder for even the most benign of critical detractors.  In summary, this CD is fantastic.<br /><br />The opening track to this two CD masterpiece, \\"The Glass Prison,\\" has some of the most phenomenal guitar work of any band I have ever heard.  Every time I listen to how quickly the lead guitar is being play I am in awe that human fingers can move so fast.  The style combines hard rock, progressive rock and a flavor of nu-metal to create an original, technical, and yet artistic song.  There is much in this song to commend it to a much wider audience than is typical of any one of these individual genres.  Progressive long at nearly 14 minutes, the group uses a variety of influences to create an evolutionary song that is simultaneously challenging and listenable.  This song is the antithesis of shy.<br /><br />The second song, \\"Blind Faith,\\" is generally much mellower than the dynamic and explosive first song.  The song begins slick and smooth with less heaviness than the first song, sounding almost pop.  However, the build up to the chorus puts to flight the thought that this song is anything other than a vicious wolf in sheep's clothing.  The charging guitars in the lengthy bridge cracker crunch into the notes leading to a lovely (yes, that is what I meant) piano piece before getting into a bass driven run-up to instruments enthusiastically alternating for the lead until the last vocal set is reached.  This song is well-crafted with an excellent balance of art and technical skill.<br /><br />There is Moody Blues transition between \\"Blind Faith\\" and the \\"Misunderstood.\\"  Unless you are watching the track changes you could easily miss the beginning of this track as there is no pause between tracks.  \\"Misunderstood\\" is one my favorite tracks on this CD.  The quiet, slow, introduction lulls you into a passivity that is instantly and violently blown away as the instruments and vocals shatter drivingly into your brain.  I think I hear a mellotron in this song, which I always enjoy.<br /><br />\\"The Great Debate\\" takes on the challenge of human stem cell and other human cell research.  The song begins with speakers stating portions of the opposing viewpoints, coming from opposite speakers.  The complexity of the song matches the complexity of the subject, and the tone of the song is somber and sincere.  The music and the lyrics provide ample opportunity to contemplate the content of the lyrics, which summarize the opposing viewpoints nicely (moral and ethical versus practical and beneficial), and suggest that we as a race are at a crossroads of sorts and we need to make a decision.  The song suggests that we need to \\"turn to the light,\\" which I take to mean we need to face this issue rather than turn away, as our decision may define who we are.<br /><br />The heady moral complexity of the previous song contrasts with the simpler, and yet emotionally more powerful content of \\"Disappear.\\"  Since this song deals with death and loss, some of the lyrics in the previous song are put into perspective, because you sense by the position of this song on the CD that failure of science may have led to the loss felt in this song.  Every word sung is painfully wrought and pulled from a deep secret place where you may have thought they were secure.  The song has hopeful elements, but the dark nature of the music indicates that the singer is still grieving over the loss of she who gave him hope.  This song is one of those that you should listen to only when you are not already feeling morose.<br /><br />Thus far I have only discussed the first disc of this CD.  The second disc deserves its own, completely separate review because it bears no relationship whatsoever to the first disc.  In the classic tradition of progressive rock, the second disc is a concept with an introductory instrumental overture that combines some classical elements with hard rock, and an exit finale that sums it all up.  In between is an exploration of the human mind, and what can appear to be insanity, or sanity, as there is no single definition for sanity.  The music ranges from contemplative to crispy, from idle slow to light speed fast, from quiet to blast-off.  This disc contains a concept album to rival some of the best progressive rock music concepts.<br /><br />When I listen to this two-disc set I hear influences from an array of groups, and I hear something completely new.  When I was introduced to this music by another reviewer (now going under the name Samhot), it was so different from anything I had previously heard that it has taken me more than a year to come to grips with the music.  This music is faster paced and more complex than early progressive rock.  This music brings in modern rock elements, along with music from several other groups, to revitalize progressive rock, which had become somewhat moribund in the 80s and early 90s.  The modernization of progressive rock is welcome to an old-timer like me, who has followed progressive rock from its roots in \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" to the seminal \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and its explosion into a separate genre populated by King Crimson, Yes, Genesis and a few select others.  This new generation of artists is giving a new generation of listeners and an old generation of listeners a reason to return to progressive rock.es its own, completely separate review because it bears no relationship whatsoever to the first disc.

B00000K0DQ|5.0|This film was the supreme test to Susan Sarandon and her best achievement in her career. In this role as nun she gave a masterful class of facial expression and body language , having in mind she had the camera very close the ninety five per cent of the time. Furthermore I guess the real intention of this approach was accent the dramatis personae between these two souls so opposite in principles and ethics.<br /><br />The rhythmic pulse is extremely peaceful making the film was a bit overlong with unnecessary overdramatic concessions. Sean Penn faced to my mind the most difficult role in his career and his slow and progressive transformation through the clever dialogues will reveal something you anticipate.<br /><br />This delicate theme about the death execution had never focused with admirable realism. And may be with the honorable exception of In cold blood , the American Cinema never before reached such status level in this issue.
B00005JNLY|4.0|If it were possible to rate this movie higher than a four but not quite a five I would do so.  This is really a great love story, more about a love of life and how mixed up we all are at times in our relationships.<br /><br />We have a housekeeper who has nothing but her daughter, character and her morality living with a very rich and somewhat well known family in Malibu or Beverly Hills, depending on the timing of the movie.  It is fast paced, sometimes funny, sometimes sad and you also experience a whole wide range of emotions.<br /><br />Brooks does a good job of developing the characters and even the underlying theme has some basis in real life.  Tia Leoni plays a very frustrated housewife who co-owns her husbands 4 star restaurant.  This is a unique role for me to see Leoni in.  I have enjoyed her in Family Man and Deep Impact, but Leoni is superb in this role.  At times you just think, where does she get off with her approach to life?  If she were a real person, you would just be infuriated at her.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman plays her mom, she does a good job in her later years, and it is nice to see someone of her age still acting.<br /><br />This is also a different role for Sandler and he, like Leoni, show that he can truly act, that comedy is not the only thing he is capable of.  You just really like him in this movie.<br /><br />There are some very touching scenes between Sandler and his daughter and the housekeeper and her daughter.<br /><br />This is a good movie, not much language, a little intense at times, but fun and a good story.  Spanglish is worth it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album is amazing! Most definetely one of the best that I own. The music blends psychedelic electronic sounds and rock fundementals. The combination makes this composition unbelievable, not to mention the lyrics. This band has a way of moving you every time you listen to them. De-Loused in the Comatorium is a CD that I am never going to get tired of. Still today I enjoy it as much as the first time I listened to it.
B00064MW6A|1.0|The only redeeming quality this movie has is that Halle Berry -- slumming after her Oscar win -- looks utterly hot in her leather Catwoman outfit.  Beyond that, this movie is just bad.  The plot is hackneyed and the acting is less than quality.  I don't know if Halle Berry did this movie for the money, but she \\"acts\\" as if she did.  Berry's performace has none of the passion or tortured psychology of this classic Batman hero/villian.  The rest of the cast is laughable at best.  Sharon Stone proves once again that she is nothing more than a pretty face (and even that is questionable these days); Benjamin Bratt was totally miscast.  The producers of this film had the opportunity build upon the excellent portrayal of Catwoman by Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns, but fail miserably.  This movie doesn't even compare to the campy performances of Julie Newmar, Lee Meriweather, and Eartha Kitt in the 1960s TV show.  Skip this movie, it's just not worth the effort.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|As good as the first movie, simple as that and maybe even better. Great acting (like in most of his films) by Matt Damon and great moves as Bourne in this one. Not the kind of movie to pick-apart, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Whew! And isn't that why we go to movies, escape and to be someone we can't. Well, that's my preference anyway. Enjoy the ride!
B000268QB2|5.0|I discovered Keane after seeing the video for \\"Somewhere only we know\\". My friends also recommended the cd \\"Hopes and Fears\\" because we are huge Coldplay fans. There are some similarities between the two bands but there is a different vibe and sound with Keane. Coldplay may always be my favorite band and Chris Martin my favorite song writer but Keane is also very good. The vocals of Chaplin are tender and emotive and I love the intensity and passion of the piano which isn't always considered a modern sounding instrument. I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to come away feeling refreshed yet intrigued. My favorite songs are \\"somewhere only we know\\" and  \\"bedshaped\\" which has a great chorus which gives me goosebumps. This cd is great for relaxing before bed or becoming energized before work--anytime. Enjoy!
B000083E79|5.0|I had to give this five stars because for a best of Cher with limited track numbers, this one is the best, in my humble opinion. Short of a multi-disc or boxed set, it is a strong album with a great variety of songs ranging from the folky Sonny and Cher days all the way to the techno-pop sound of Believe.<br /><br />I recently saw Cher in concert and was awed by the sheer magnitude of the concert. She still knows how to throw a party, I'll say that much for her! And this album contains most of what she sang at the concert.<br /><br />A couple of songs missing that I wish were included are 'Baby Don't Go' and 'Love and Understanding'.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great showing of Cher's wide range of talent and her ability to adapt to the times.
B000021Y77|4.0|Lola is a girl stuck in a dilemna:  how to save her boyfriend from being killed.  So, in the spirit of Groundhog Day, she keeps repeating the day over and over again until she gets it right.  But unlike Groundhog Day, this indie film has an edgy style, mixed with a punkish Lola and cartoonish pop culture animation.  Without giving away too  much, she somehow ends up solving her dilemna but after several crazy attempts that shed light into her own seemingly average, but soon-to-be complicated life.
0312997221|4.0|The Avenger is the type of spy thriller that Forsythe does best. <br /> <br />It begins in Bosnia during the Bosnia/ Serb mess and ends in an obscure Central American country in September, 1991.  Do not be alarmed, Forsythe does not trade on 9/11.  However, he tracks a Serbian underworld figure and ties him in with 1991 terrorists. <br /> <br />Forsythe crafts the novel out of a series of chapters jumping from one character's biography to the present to another biography and back to the unfolding yarn.  As he goes, you begin to see the intertwining relationships as they gather.  Eventually they build to an exciting and very clever climax. <br /> <br />The characters are terrific.  There are the black and white bad guys and good guys and one extremely thought-provoking character who takes the ends justifies the means tact.  One is left wondering at the end which is better - the really really good guy or the guy who looks at the end, then the means.  It is that conundrum that separates the Avenger from a mere thriller. <br /> <br />As all of Forsythe's books, it is well-written and researched.  Well worth the read.  Also, if you listen to the unabridged book on cassette, the reader is terrific.
B000084T18|5.0|This cd was in my opinion the 400 degreez of the north.  This was a classic that would soon set the standard for new york city rap,  going 6 times platinum plus. And this cd was straight fire throughout, even the bonus material is hot.  Highley recomemded for rap fans.
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier was one of the best books I ever read.  The authors's language beatifully protrays the life of a young woman who marries a widower trying to start over.  Unfortunately, the young lady must fight the memory of Rebecca, her husband's late wife, to win him back.  But there are many secrets at the Manderley estate, and some, which do not want to be discovered.
0307277674|2.0|Yes, I have read the book. Fiction or not, this book is filled with reckless accusations against Christianity. The church is called misogynist and essentially conspiratorial, having a long-term agenda of suppressing women. The account of Eve's sin is mentioned as an anti-female thing. This conveniently ignores the fact that Adam is also listed in the Bible as the original sinner. All positive references to women in Scripture are conveniently ignored in this tendentious book. And strange how it is that, for a supposedly misogynist religion out to make females out to be malevolent beings, Christianity does not portray Satan as a female entity. The book also repeats long-discredited feminist myths of a onetime peaceful world under the Mother Goddess. In fact, as far back as archeology can show, violence was universal. A \\"golden age\\" of peaceful matriarchy (that was supposed to have preceded the big, bad patriarchial Christian church) never existed.<br /><br />The book makes transparently false and silly statements about the Gnostic \\"Gospels\\", the Biblical Canon, Constantine, the Council of Nicea, etc. In terms of historical accuracy, the book is worthless. This book is just the latest anti-Christian fad, belonging in the same genre as Allegro's THE MUSHROOM AND THE CROSS and Schoenfeld's THE PASSOVER PLOT. Finding \\"hidden messages\\" in DaVinci's works is pure fantasy, on par with Von Daniken's wacko notions (e. g., CHARIOTS OF THE GODS) of past extraterrestrial visitors to Earth that he imagines in Scripture and in ancient architecture.<br /><br />I am surprised that such a shoddy book could have been so acclaimed and have become a bestseller. On second thought, I am not. After all, Christianity is the only religion that can be safely maligned in this politically correct age. And knowledge of the nature and history of Christianity is almost nonexistent among both Christians and non-Christians. Many people want their ears tickled, and this is all that this book does. In fact, it is nothing but rehashed anti-Christian feminist fantasies-the same stuff that's been around since at least the 1960's.nothing but rehashed anti-Christian feminist fantasies-the same stuff that's been around since at least the 1960's.
B0002X314C|5.0|I am so glad that I went out and got this cd.  These past months, I bought some of the other cd's (such as Concrete Rose by Ashanti and Destiny Fulfilled by Destiny's Child) and found myself HIGHLY disappointed.  This album definetly gets a 9.5/10.  I did not think this album would be that good b/c I thought \\"Used to Love You\\" was just an ok song.  I also thought that this album would be just like the other r&b albums that have been recently released where artists just put out any trash and people love it b/c the artists are marketed well, have nice beats, and catchy songs (again- examples Ashanti, Destiny's Child, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Nelly etc)  But when I heard \\"Ordinary People\\" on the radio, it made me change my mind about John Legend.  So I went out and bought the cd.  After listening to this cd one time, I was blown away!  You can actually play this cd from track #1-14 w/o skipping any songs.  This cd is unique and well put together.   <br /> <br />1.  Prelude 8/10 (even the intro to the album is great!) <br /> <br />2.  Let's Get Lifted 8.5/10 <br /> <br />3.  Used to Love You  8.5/10 <br /> <br />4.  Alright  8/10 <br /> <br />5.  She Don't Have to Know 8.5/10 <br /> <br />6.  Number One  8/10 <br /> <br />7.  I Can Change  8/10 <br /> <br />8.  Ordinary People 10/10 <br /> <br />9.  Stay With You  9.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Let's Get Lifted Again  11/10!  (This is the BEST song on the cd!) <br /> <br />11. So High 10/10 (my second favorite song on this cd) <br /> <br />12.  Refuge (When it's Cold Outside) 10/10  <br /> <br />13.  It Don't Have to Change 10/10 <br /> <br />14.  Live It Up  9/10 <br /> <br />I advise anyone who likes good, soulful music to buy this cd.  It's worth your money.
0790729644|5.0|This isn't just a movie, it's a premium study of human nature. \\"Unforgiven\\" is a tale straight from the borderlands between good and evil.  The plot is interesting but in no way explains the film's allure.  The acting is superb and this is particularly true in regards to Gene Hackman and Richard Harris. English Bob is not on the screen long but Harris puts in a tremendous, and very memorable, performance.  Hackman's Little Bill is haunting and you'd honestly have to say that Eastwood is nearly as good as his depiction of William Munney is subtle and flawless.  The ending blazes and Clint gets in a few top notch oneliners like, \\"Anyone who doesn't want to die can go out the back.\\"  Ah, this film has been great every time I've seen it.<br /><br />Was this one the last of the great westerns?  Yes \\"Unforgiven\\" certainly is wonderful, but hopefully it won't be one of the last of its kind.  There's still energy in this genre and I'm hoping that more movies like it are made in the future.
0385513755|5.0|I finally broke down and read the book of the century!. This book is a wonderful, historical, FICTIONAL NOVEL. If read with that in mind, it will fascinate you. Should you choose books based on reviews, then beware that it has twisted the undies of conservative Catholics! You who are looking to give it 1 star in the hopes I would be spared the mercy of reading such lies really do need to get a life! At some points a reader may even question truth from fiction, but at the conclusion I seriously doubt that the Catholic Church is in any jeopardy of losing true believers. A well written mystery for anyone -religious and non-religious readers. Enjoy!<br />[...]
B00004ZAV3|5.0|As much as I love this cd, I really need to get around to checking out other Beatles albums.  But this collection of songs is so good that I can't pick a favorite song
0765309408|5.0|This was a great and very imaginative book! It was very funny and paralleled much with how the world is today. I would highly suggest this book; it was a good balance of the good, bad, humor, ect.. I would highly suggest this book for the sci-fi lover. :) And anyone else, for that matter.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|ok, in terms of MJ tracks not on his albums, it's missing 'Say Say Say' the #1 duet with paul Mccartney, plus Rockwell's 'Somebody's Watching Me' on which Michael sang the chorus.  there's also a tracks from the dangerous sessions 'If You Don't Love Me' and 'For All Time' not included, plus 'Hotstreet' from the thriller sessions, and 'shout' from the invincible sessions.  but otherwise they've done a pretty good job of compiling rarities and b-sides from the king's carreer. <br /> <br />the DVD is absolutely FANTASTIC!
B0001AP12G|5.0|What an album! I can't wait for Kanye's next one to drop! You get a feel of every kind of music you can think of from this cd, with other great artists featired on it, such as Ludacris, Jay-Z, Twista, and even Jamie Foxx. Go buy this album, it's great.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|I saw a movie that was kind of like this, except better.  It was called Sleepers.  Better cast, better plot, better version of a similar story.  Don't waste your time with Penn, Robbins, and Bacon in Mystic River.  Check out Pitt, DeNiro, Hoffman, and Bacon in Sleepers.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange has to be one of the best books I have ever read in my life.  I am the type of reader that will pick up a book and if it's good, it will become my new favorite.  I can honestly say that A Clockwork Orange hasn't been topped since I read it earlier this year.  I originally started the book last year, but with my busy schedule, I didn't have time to finish it.  This year was a different story, I could not put the book down.  Burgess' use of the NADSAT language filled with the vile images leaves you with a life long memory of it all.  I don't have one problem with this book, I can't say that about many things.  I have reread it now a couple of times and is falling apart with all the notes I have taken in it.  It has such a deep meaning that can be topped by very few books.  I give this book my ultimate rating.
B00013EY7Q|5.0|When I first saw this movie, honestly, I wasn't impressed. My friends drug me out to see it, so I just \\"went along for the ride\\". Not only did my mind wander, but I only got a cursory view of what the movie is about. I decided to give it another chance, and it was indeed a film that pulls you in. Having been to Tokyo myself, it was  a small dose of familiarity. This is a film that must be viewed a few times to really be appreciated.    Bill Murray plays the role of Bob Harris, an actor who seems to be going through a mid-life crisis in both his career and marriage. Harris flies to Tokyo to film a commercial for Suntory Whisky, and seems not to enjoy the job too much, despite the healthy financial compensation. Scarlett Johhannsen plays the role of Charlotte, a young wife who tags along with her workaholic photographer husband. She appears to be neglected as a wife, and yearns for her husband's attention, and eventually, anyone's attention. Bored and feeling neglected, she ventures out of the confines of her hotel room, and into the pulsating, neon lit and mysterious atmosphere of Tokyo, a world unto itself. She not only enjoys the modern, contemporary side, but respects and appreciates the ancient and traditonal customs as well.  A few nights later, unable to sleep, Charlotte heads down to the bar where Harris is having a nightcap, and the two instantly connect. I  think the reason for the connection was the fact that they sensed each other were lost, and at different crossroads in their own lives, and not so much the fact that they were both many miles from home. I believe the fact that the bar was filled with other Americans confirms this, at least from my own perspective. This movie should speak volumes to everyone, because we have, or will experience being \\"Lost in Translation\\" at some point in our lives. We will be Bob Harris or Charlotte, and will deal with our journeys in our own unique ways. Sometime, I feel like Bob Harris, and can definitely identify withhim, but in my own way. It also demonstrates that even though many of our friendships may last for just a \\"season\\", they will be un forgettable.  The two begin to explore the city's karaoke bars, districts and parties. One would probably interpret that there is something sexual about to occur here due to the chemistry between Bill and Charlotte, but that doesn't happen. However, when Charlotte knocks on Bob's door one morning and finds he is in the company of another woman, she is indeed offended, as if it were her own lover or husband. The ending is very special, as Bob, who could not wait to leave Japan at the beginning of the movie, suddenly finds himself dreading the trip back to the states and leaving Charlotte behind. I also think the location adds to the mystique of this great film. This will stay in my collection forever! All I can say now is \\"WoW\\"!
B0007GBBVO|5.0|Anyone interested in 3D movies will be blown away by this one. The 3D image in it is so superior to any I've ever seen, including IMAX!! The story is silly, but interesting, only it is the 3D graphics that will keep you watching this over and over. There is enough \\"out of the screen\\" action to make you giggle, and the in depth image is so crystal clean. I can only hope that the company that made it, 3dforyourtv.com will continue to produce more of these fun movies in such a great 3D format.
1592400876|5.0|As an eighth grade English teacher, I am constantly bombarded with bad grammar -- essay after essay filled with words like \\"alot\\" and \\"cause\\" (as in, 'I like pizza \\"cause\\" it tastes so good.').  We are on the front line of the war on errors in syntax and sentence structure, and let me tell you, it is NOT pretty.   <br /> <br />Truss, a fellow stickler for the well-punctuated sentence, does a fantastic job illustrating our society's lack of sense when it comes to spelling, punctuation, and word usage.  She regards herself as somewhat obsessive, but I feel relieved that someone else out there is paying attention.  Moreover, I love the fact that she has the guts to confront violators (risking ridicule and name-calling).  Just last week I received a catalog for \\"Writing Rescources\\".  Don't get me started with parent notes asking me to \\"except\\" late work, and I've always felt that high schools that display signs wishing \\"congradulations\\" to the winning team should be fined!  Truss is my new hero!   <br /> <br />In short, Truss transforms a topic that is considered boring by most into acceptable dinner party conversation.  Readers will enjoy the pace and could expect to become instant grammarians.  I applaud her approach, and I look forward to living in a world that cares if infinitives are split and if the apostrophe is in the right place!
B00008PW2D|4.0|Although the 5th season was entertaining and funny I was dissapointed that there were only 8 episodes. The story lines were sort of scattered around with no connections but I still found it exremely fun to watch with many laugh at loud scenes. <br />It's still \\"Sex\\" so me likey anyway besides only 8 episodes.
B000000W6X|5.0|Few weeks ago I bought this disk, after buying Mezz, Blue Lines and 100th Window a long time ago. Why didn't I buy it sooner, you ask? For starters, I always wanted another CD first in stead of this one, I always moved it. And also because pretty much all the critici gave this album a bad review, saying the only worthly songs on it are 'Protection' and 'Karmacoma'. So with low expectations I bought this and putted in the disk-player. First there were 'Protection' and 'Karmacoma' wich I already knew they were great, so no surprises yet. So when 'Karmacoma' ended I was preparing myself hearing really crappy and lame music. But it wasn't... to be honoust it was really good, extraordinary. Near the end I knew it for sure: Protection is better than Blue Lines. Blue Lines was revolutionary and very good, but it sounds so dated and Protection is more exciting with its fascinating and sometimes even strange sound.   'Protection' and 'Karmacoma' are the best tracks on the album and 2 of MA's toppers, while 'Protection' has very soft, fragile vocals and smooth instruments, 'Karmacoma' sounds very Jamacian with its rap vocals (Normally I don't like rap but it seems to work very well on Massive Attack-tracks), I can hardly choose wich one is the best between those 2 songs. 'Three' has a really fascinating intro, and a male voice who is always repeating the same line, and beautiful female vocals, that all together makes this another stand out.  'Weather Storm' is a very nice jazzy instrumential with a playful piano and decent beats. 'Spying Glass' is by far the weirdest track on this album. A strange combination between jazzy instruments and chilling vocals makes this track very special, but not all listeners might like it. 'Better Things' has some nice jazzy bass-lines and a quit beautiful melody. Vocals are not less then amazing again.  'Euro Child' is the darkest song on here, but it doesn't lose the jazzy feel on this disk. Dark rap-vocals, with creepy jazz-sounds mixed withquit weird instruments makes this another stand out, my third favourite..  Yet another fascinating track, and a single, is 'Sly'. Again an outstanding combination between instrumentents. Vocals are mysterious and the Digiridu's add that little extra a song needs to be good. The strikers give a more classical feel to it.   Then we have another instrumential, but this one is more complex and less jazzy than 'Weather Storm'. Synths were used instead of a piano. Good, but I must say, I like 'Weather Storm' better.   After 'Heat Miser' I usually start over the album, because the next song isn't really good, it's in my opinion the only disappointement on this disk. Maybe because 'Light My Fire' is just...well...so non-Massive Attack. It has not instruments enough to be a worthy MA-track, it sounds so empty. And live-songs on an album usually don't sound very good anyway.   Nevertheless this is an incredible album, better then Blue Lines. Mezzanine is still my favourite, about half an inch ahead of Protection. I might say, Protection makes Mezzanine sound less impressive..

The humor is brilliantly crafted, and the characters are both outrageous and believable.  But more importantly Joseph Heller explores the nature of human survival, morality, and patriotism in ways that few other authors have even attempted

0385510454|2.0|This book is just like the last few books have been. Disappointing!  I always wait for Grisham books in anticipation.  I loved \\"A Time to Kill\\", and \\"The Firm\\", this doesn't come close.  I really hope that Grisham starts taking the time to write the masterpiece that he truly is capable of, and not these hollywood movie scripts.
0385510454|2.0|I have read most all of Grisham's book and I have enjoyed most. He usually deals with some facet of the legal profession and he usually spins an intriguing yarn about whatever one he has chosen. This book is neither about the legal profession nor intriguing. A Washington power broker has gone to prison in an attempt to stay alive and to protect a secret that only he knows the answer to. The CIA head arranges a pardon from an outgoing president who seems even more craven in his granting of pardons than WJC. The purpose of setting him free is to see which of several nations that are out to get him, actually kill him. Remaining in CIA \\"custody\\" he is spirited away to Italy where we spend far too much of the book following his learning of Italian and the ways of an Italian citizen. A scandal erupts back in DC about some of the president's pardons with the liklihood that at least one was arranged because of a large bribe to obtain it and his pardon is suggested to be a possibility. The broker, Joel Backman, learns of the scandal and fearing (rightly) for his life sets about to escape from his handlers and try and set things right back in Washington in order to stay alive. This is all done in a somewhat trite and predictable fashion with a trite and predictable result. Far from Grisham's best.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|It is hard to imagine it, but before Donald Rumsfeld, Robert McNamara was the most controversial Secretary of War since Edwin Stanton (FYI, he served under Lincoln). <br /> <br />The reviews all testify to the fact that liberals and conservatives have pro and con views of both the man, and the film which examines what he believes he has learned from two wars and decades of reflection over the consequences.  Some of his conclusions are admittedly self-serving, but taken in the context of the current American foreign policy, it is a credible contrast.   <br /> <br />McNamara poignantly admits to making mistakes and perhaps questions the morality of those choices.  He still tears up when he recalls President Kennedy, and his anguish between loyalty to LBJ and wanting to untangle the mess Vietnam ultimately became reveal an honesty and humanity few public figures exhibit. <br /> <br />The score by Philip Glass adds depth and gravitas to an already somber theme (the brutality and pain of war), and director Errol Morris' use of extreme close-ups and off-kilter editing do much to reveal the pain, and at times desperation with which McNamara seeks to warn us of the potential consequences of our actions.  Particular in this regard is his recollection of Tommy Thompson's lone voice of opposition during the Cuban Missile crisis.  According to \\"Mac\\", it was pure dumb luck that saved us from apocolypse, and if not for a single voice of reason, it is likely that Kennedy would have followed the advice of the Joint Chief's and ordered an invasion of Cuba.  Castro later revealed that not only had there been operational warheads on Cuba (which could have killed tend of millions of Americans), but he had advised their use had the US invaded.  It begs the question, how would President Bush have handled this crisis, and what would have been the cost?  Extrapolation to the current day, and current handling of the war will yield interesting conclusions. <br /> <br />Viewer's may watch this film with pre-conceived notions of who Robert McNamara was, and the long-term effects of his decisions.  But as America enters its second year of Iraqi liberation/occupation, few men are more qualified than he is to warn us of the dangers of military/political hubris.  It is a timely documentary, and a voice, very much worth listening to.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It seems the worst thing people can say about Muse is that they sound like Radiohead. This sounds like praise to me, although I'd have to agree with the consenus of others here, that Muse may actually be better than Radiohead. I can't stop listening to them. Every song on this album is beautiful, with complex melody lines and piano that rivals Ben Folds. \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" are fantastic. \\"Showbiz\\" is an incredible album as well. (Just listen to \\"Sunburn\\" and you'll be hooked.)
B00008CLOA|5.0|I have always thought that the sound on the earlier CD version of this album was quite hard-edged, but this SACD release brings out the full range dynamics of this wonderful album. This is one of the best pop music album of all time and it never gets old and this SACD version brings out the brilliant sound of the LPs back.  Highly recommended
B000002897|4.0|The most beautifull album from one of the best Seattle bands ever, Screaming trees , folk influences from frontman Mark Lanegan were evident since the grunge era and were a glympse of what a fascinating composer Mr Lanegan was destined to be, in Seattle the scene was colorfull and that movement provided to rock and roll one of their most prolific genres despite being a brief dreamy movement that at first didnt seemed to end but saddly it finally happened , however great music were made in those years , and Screaming Trees is one of these seeds , \\"Sweet Oblivion\\" is their most sublime and poetic offer , southern influences hard to deny , \\"grunge for the intelligent men\\" i would call it , to be more specific please check out \\"more or less\\", \\"winter song\\" , \\"trobled times\\" and \\"no one knows\\" this is a beautifull and sublime album i repeat,  theres no other way to describe it. <br />get it and enjoy <br />HM
0596007124|5.0|Gamma and Helm liked it, read blurbs inside front cover then compare with the Shalloway/Trott DP intro.  Both excellent books, pick the one that works for your style of learning.   S/T is a (beautifully written) conventional narrative tutorial covering about the same number of DP's.  (I Haven't looked at Holub's book, or Refactor'g to Patterns)     HeadFirst works because the cartoons, dialogs, quizzes and other heuristics/mnemomics all reinforce what a working developer would stumble over: you're told: \\"Program to interfaces\\", \\"duck-type\\", whatever, but you can't really do that til you've mastered a certain number of DP's.  So the book talks about pragmatics and compromises, some built into java libs, others built into the economics of delivering software (and tells you to be patient and keep reading).    Interesting thing about Head1st: usually when i'm done absorbing technical material, it's covered with highlighter and notes in red ink.  This book is clean, because the Freemans's pseudo-handwritten notes to source code have anticipated most of my questions.  Pretty neat trick.    Shalloway/Trott book has source in java, C# and C++, between the book and website.  Head1st only has java, but the java source should be straightforward enough for non-javistas who know basics  (interfaces, abstract meths, namespace / method resolution, compile vs runtime )to work thru.  There's a very limited amount of java-exclusive material (java.io, java.util.Observable).  Both books are recent vintage, cover 1.4 (I think) so you don't have to deal with ancient Java syntax.    (and just as an aside, these DP books seem to have inspired some of the best Amazon reviews i've ever read)
0767821769|3.0|Stepmom was a good drama film.  I have seen this movie several times and it is still a tearjerker to me.  It is a movie that has you laughing at some parts, but crying throughout most of it.  The plot in this movie was continuous, there were not many dull moments.  I find myself getting bored very quickly through movies, but I did not get bored in this movie, and I still don't after seeing in multiple times.  The actors and actresses did a well job playing the roles of their characters.  The children played their roles exceptionally well.  Overall, Stepmom was a excellent drama that is a movie you should watch if you are in the mood for some laughs as well as some tears.
0151001634|5.0|Although it is exceptionally written, this book will not be an easy read for the compassionate reader.  The voice of Charlie, a mentally disabled man who becomes \\"normal\\" through an operation and then regresses, is so authentic and and his observations so clear they are heartrending to read; I am brought to tears or near to it each time I re-read the book, and it can be hard to continue without being overwhelmed by compassion and sadness for all people who are like Charlie.  Because Keyes executes his concept so intelligently and realistically, the book is not sentimental - it rings raw and true.  It is essential reading for anyone desiring to develop a love for humankind.
B000002H70|5.0|\\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Pictures Of You\\" are songs I would put continously on repeat. The level of music on these two tracks is haunting , deceiving , comforting and delirious.Lullaby has the most awesome of bass work and music you will ever hear.The whisper that are the vocals only add to the immediate goosebumps on my forearms and all across me.<br /><br />\\"Love Song\\" is a listener's delight,\\"Fascination Street\\" and \\"Disintegration\\" make me go quiet.<br /><br />\\"Prayers for Rain\\" adds to the mood of absolutely beautiful enchanting everlasting melody that the 80's was known for. I havent heard 80's music but I can safely say this album by THE CURE contains the best music I have heard in the 80's.<br /><br />\\"Same Deep Water As You\\" is something I can simply not believe is playing when Im listening to it. The vocals are like the water when one's dreaming and everything is just so set in.<br /><br />The album is something I would auction off my diary to support and I stand by it as one of the most inspiring works in music that  I have ever heard. Its not about music but its about the spoke words being sung in a way of absolute bliss and uncaring yet perfection achieving strains.<br /><br />With Much Incalculable Love and Respect,<br /><br />A Music Fan
0553801546|5.0|At last we have a really great fantasy series that ENDS effectively! <br />FitzChivalry Farseer is what Robert Jordan would call a \\"Ta'veren\\", the kind of character around whom history weaves itself, except that he has a special friend, the Fool, who helps to guide him through the changes he makes to his world. Robin Hobb has created these two characters so well that they are easily in the top 10 fantasy characters of all time. Magic is just a subtle flavour for this series, used to illuminate the moralities and intricacies of her world and the people who live in it, and as with all the best fantasies, it's use extracts an appropriate consequence from the user. <br />I don't want to go into the plot on the 9th book of the series -- if you've read the first 8, you have an idea what's coming and don't really need this review, if not, go get \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\" and get started! The Farseer Trilogy is where it all begins, where we learn to care about the characters and their world. It ends well, with only a hint that there could be more. I actually started to read Robin Hobb with the second trilogy, The Liveship Traders, which stood by itself so well that I could have stopped there, had I not been compelled by the excellence of Hobb's writing to go back to the beginning for more! The Tawny Man Trilogy, of which this book is the finale, is the icing on the cake. It's only drawback is that the love of the ships and the sea, which fairly oozed from the oakum of the Liveship Traders, is sadly missing from the naval scenes, but this is made up for by a fabulously imagined story which leaves the reader hungry for the next installment. ALL the loose ends are wrapped up, and there is no preface for another book at the end, so if Hobb intends to write more books in this world, she will need to (and easily could) go off on a tangent. Personally, I am keeping my copies so that I can read them through again in a few years, as they are the best I have read yet, of many, many series! As Fitz would say, \\"I am content\\".
B00023BLXK|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  I think I have almost wore out my DVD I play it so much.  The dancing is great!  It will make you want to take salsa lessons.  I also love the underlying plot of learning people before judging them and to watch where you step as someone's toes are always there.  I had had heard how terrible this movie was and so forth but I can say I think I like it better than the first.  I love the first one but this one the music gets you moving and the romance between the two main characters is intense.  I also loved the DANCING!  They are great!  The part with the movie is one of my favorite scenes it is romantic but not trashy.  There is intense love for one another and that acting is superb as you get caught up in each one of the characters!  If you watch this movie and enjoy the music the soundtrack is worth buying!  The music is actually from the movie!
B00005JKN9|3.0|The original premise and the truth of the matter is very interesting: people so xenophobic, they hate their own countryman. Unfortunately, the movie couldn't maintain any type of intrigue and fell to dreadful banality. Ultimately its storyline goes... \\"A young man's father is brutally killed in front of him, and he grows up and becomes a vengeful beast, oh and in the background there is a lot of injustices, crime, and war among Irishmen.\\"  <br /> <br />With the exception of \\"The Butcher,\\" all the other characters were horrid on several levels. Ironic, the most malicious character in the film is the most liked. I just couldn't get over the horrible Irish accents it was comparable to watching a high school play. I didn't buy into DiCaprio's character or Diaz's. The only good acting came from Daniel Day-Lewis, who was brilliant in the film portraying a brutal man with moral integrity.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, the storyline was predictable and laughable. There were no borders to chaos arising from the wars of the 5 corners, the war scenes were horrible, all made up of multiple 5 second clips. There were multiple minute climactic events which led me to believe the movie was about to end, unfortunately it didn't.  <br /> <br />The only positives from the movie are the variety of camera angles and shots of New York, which make for some creative cinemography. Although the film does no justice to the history of the Five Corners, it does give the audience some idea as to what went on.  <br /> <br />Overall, don't buy it, don't rent it; don't even watch it on TV. For the amount of money and time invested in this film, it fails miserably. The only reason you oughta' watch this film is if you're a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, here he is at his best. I don't care much for brazen costumes, superfluous fight scenes with mediocre acting, so I can not recommend this film to anyone. I Honestly I can't see how anyone can enjoy it.  <br /> <br />In My (not so) Humble Opinion <br />
B000002G7G|5.0|As critic Lester Bangs put it, the Velvet Underground \\"moved from 'Heroin' to 'Jesus' in just two short years.\\"    He couldn't have described this album any better.    This was the second VU album I purchased after hearing their brilliant debut. After hearing the \\"shock-value\\" of songs like \\"Venus in Furs,\\" \\"Heroin,\\" and \\"The Black Angel's Death Song,\\" I kinda expected the same with this album. Sadly, John Cale is absent from here on out. Tension was created between Cale and Reed, which then led to Cale leaving the band. So... no wacky viola or organ here, which may look like a fatal blow to the band, but not really. Another man named Doug Yule joined the group. Though he's no John Cale (no viola whatsoever), Yule has talent on the organ (listen to \\"What Goes On\\") and provides some vocal talent as well. But with Yule on-board, we get ballads and folky tunes reminescent of a few previous VU songs such as \\"Sunday Morning,\\" \\"Femme Fatale,\\" and \\"I'll Be Your Mirror.\\" The Velvets showed that they're capable of writing beautiful songs rather than noisy, freaky, sadomasochistic, drugged up tunes.    Songs like \\"Candy Says,\\" \\"Pale Blue Eyes,\\" \\"Jesus,\\" and \\"After Hours,\\" are some of the big highlights of the album, showcasing Reed's poetic and beautiful lyrics as well as the band playing very soft (note the latter being sung by Moe Tucker... very sweet and it's just cute how she sings). Hearing them can mesmerize and perhaps even \\"speak\\" to the listener. Songs of self-loathing, love, and redemption are what goes on (no pun intended) in a person's everyday life. \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" are more upbeat, rock & roll pieces (perhaps giving a hint of what to expect on \\"Loaded\\").    One song in particular is often disliked by many. The nearly 9-minute epic \\"The Murder Mystery\\" is a weird track that seems out of place on this album. At one point, Sterling Morrison and Doug Yule recite passages at the same time, and at another, Reed and Tucker recite more passages. One person would speak in the left-speaker channel and the other person in the right-speaker. Somewhat similar to the content featured on previous VU songs like \\"The Gift\\" and \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" (in other words, violent and bloody recitals), \\"The Murder Mystery\\" is muddled and nearly un-listenable... but... beacuse of that, I like it. It challenges you to listen to what's going on (kinda like \\"The Gift\\") and hear who's dying or how they're dying. It could've fit well on \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" but just [try to] have fun hearing songs about murders, deaths, and gory dismemberments... heh, this album isn't so soft as it may seem upon first listen.    \\"The Velvet Underground\\" may take a while to grow on you, particularly if you expect more hectic chaos or John Cale's wacky viola and organ. Nonetheless, you will be surprised and think of how the Velvets \\"moved from 'Heroin' to 'Jesus' in just two short years.\\" Answer: John Cale gone, Doug Yule in, and the fact that a lot of their music equipment were stolen. Aside from that, this is a relaxing and easy-listening experience. The Velvets were lost and finding hope... behold, they saw the light and told their experiences. Love, finding one's place, and gaining faith is what the album is all about. This is unlike anything the Velvets have made before. And this is what makes \\"The Velvet Underground\\" perhaps their strongest and most powerful album.    Plus, we have Moe Tucker singing. :o)
B00005JNEI|5.0|Well...after reading some of the reviews that said this was banned on bases you will think not so shocking if you have watched this movie!  The movie does not tell you what to think and if you don't believe something in the movie then you still will not believe it when the movie is over so what is the harm in watching this movie?!  I absolutely love this movie.  I was opened up to Michael Moore when I watched Bowling for Columbine and have been following him closely since then.  I wanted to see this movie at the movie theater, yet the people who I know did not want to go and support this movie...their choice!  I did however buy it the day it came out and was pleased I bought it.  I absolutely love it and it opened my eyes to controversies that I thought might be happening, but was sure how they would go about it.  I think my favorite part in the movie was when Michael Moore and a recruiter for the military stood outside the Capital building and tried to Recruit the children of government people.  Just funny how they don't want to send their own kids but would send everyone else's in a heartbeat.  Food for thought...I also loved the way it went from serious to silly and also posed thought provoking questions.  I think everyone should watch this movie at least once and if you don't like it then don't watch it again!  Everyone is entitled to an opinion and if you don't watch this movie and  judge it,  then you are spreading ignorance,  if you watch this movie and then don't like it at least you will have a base to go from!  I don't think this movie will change opinions but I think it will provide food for thought.  My biggest peeve is that people who have not seen this movie talk about how bad it is...yet they have nothing to base that opinion on!  This movie is in no way unpatriotic!  It is actually quite patriotic-Michael only wants the best for the people of the United States and especially for our troops all over the world! Hope everyone who checks out this movie at least watches it to form their own opinion!
B000002I27|5.0|Hailed as the group's darkest album, \\"Strange Days\\" revolves around the hippie movement of the '60s and the Vietnam war. Although most songs were made during the same time as their debut, both are completely different sounding albums. One shouldn't make the mistake by labeling this album as an album containing a bunch of leftovers (or just a \\"continuation\\") and saying their debut got the best. Try to picture the songs \\"Strange Days,\\" \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" or \\"People Are Strange\\" on their debut album. The flow of their debut album would sound weird. In other words, it wouldn't work.    Jim Morrison was a visionary and probably the most prophetic figure of his time. Look beyond his drunkeness, look beyond his good looks, look beyond his lovely voice and just hear what he has to say. This is an album about isolation, loss, and the loneliness that many people endured during the times of the Vietnam war. The title track could be about the drafting, which have \\"found\\" many men, \\"strange days\\" referring to the times of war, destroying \\"our casual joys,\\" and people running away from it. Some of the tracks like \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\" and \\"Unhappy Girl\\" could center around the mind of the women, who are alone, sad, and confused, who were left behind while their men are away fighting. \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" a song written by Robby Krieger, is a song about a man spending some time with his girl before he goes away to Vietnam. \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" the song Jim first sung to Ray, could be about what a couple would do once the man comes back from the war. \\"People Are Strange\\" is another song about loneliness and feeling unwanted. \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\" is perhaps a woman finding a new love, being liberated, and showing the whole world her beauty. \\"I Can't See Your Face\\" could be what's going on in a soldier's mind before he dies. \\"When the Music's Over,\\" the grandioso rock epic alternative to \\"The End,\\" a song of people fed up with what's wrong with the world (in this case, the war). An anthem for the hippie movement. An in-your-face statement. Sticking it to the man. As for \\"Horse Latitudes\\"? Hmm... I dunno... a bad dream about horses? Hey, I'm just trying to connect the dots here (and I do know that Jim wrote this in high school... all the more reason to explain why he's a prophet).    Jim Morrison's voice is still something that amazes me. Soft and romantic at one point, shifting into his chaotic and rebellious mode the next. Ray Manzarek... what more can be said about this brilliant organist? Damn fine talent. Robby Krieger, one of rock's underrated guitarists, adds more creativeness with his slide-guitar technique, making a unique sound. And John Densmore... the man that keeps the band together with his drumming.    \\"Strange Days\\" is probably not a \\"concept album\\" by any means whatsoever. It's probably not even like how I just described it. But that's just how I see it. And I'm showing why it's not just an album full of leftovers, but merely how it works as an album on its own.    \\"Strange Days\\" is the Doors' darkest album, but often misunderstood. And it comes close to being their best album.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is a masterpiece!  It caused me to have a crush on David Bowie that will not go away!   <br /> <br />Sarah gets frustrated that she is always watching her baby brother and wishes that he would disappear to the Goblin  City. Her wish comes true and she then gets a crystal ball from Goblin King (Bowie) and has so long to find Toby (her brother).  During Sarah's adventure she encounters many personalities that are interesting and also frustrating to her journey.  Hoggle is Sarah's biggest help in the end and he helps Sarah along the path and gets punished for his act.  There is a lot of great music in this movie (soundtrack is recommended) and you get caught up in the fantasy of this movie!  I have loved it since I saw it as a kid in the 80's and continue to love it as strongly as I did then!  I recommend this for anyone who likes fantasy movies! <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|I liked this film quite a bit, but rather than presenting facts Moore tends to shade the truth with all sorts of funny and unnecessary little dramas.  If you're looking for a real documentary about the war in Iraq I'd recommend \\"Rush To War.\\"  It's far more balanced than this one.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|Troy was an excellent movie.  It was well made and sucked you into the plot.  I didn't really want to see this movie as past ventures into history movies are boring...but this one changed my whole perspective!  I was wide eye and alert the whole time!  Brad Pitt who plays Achilles is such a strong actor that you hate Achilles at the same time you love him!  Especially when he helps to take over Troy.  Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana along with all the other actors also give excellent strong performances.  I think for me personally the battle scenes were the best and they were the most powerful!  Yet, the romance between Achilles and Orlando and Eric's cousin was extremely powerful with the take over of Troy.  I also thought the scene where Achilles (Pitt) challenges Paris (Bloom) and Paris wimps out and his brother (Bana) takes the battle on and ends up losing his life over it was powerful!  And the treatment Achilles gives to Bana and then the talk with King Priam (Bana's father) was just excellent.  You really become attached to the characters and you will feel like you are there because it is so well made.  I recommend this movie for anyone who wants a plot that follows through and acting/scenery that is amazing!
B000002UAO|1.0|Rubber soul, like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is truly painful to listen to in 2005. <br /> <br />The peoples are so archaic.

0312263120|3.0|Digital Fortress was Brown's first published novel, and the last one I happened to read. Some very familiar basics immediately popped into mind while reading Digital Fortress, while there were also some crucial things missing. <br /> <br />The similarities are the main characters are supposedly highly intelligent (though naive and sometimes a tad looking into things too much ), there's a bunch of plots-twists, killers on the loose, and some rather nicely done cliffhangers. <br /> <br />The differences are that Brown usually does his research. That completely lacked in this book. I have to agree with earlier reviewers that the number of mistakes made were too numerous to be ignored. The last part completely resembles bit and pieces from the movie 'hackers', where fancy graphical screens replace the dull windows hackers (and system administrators) usually employ. <br /> <br />The plot twists in Digital Fortress were at times predictable, sometimes just plain unbelievable. The professor/fiancee escaped death (and the hands of an experienced assassin) way too easily, and some of the dialogue just made one just groan and cringe when reading it. <br /> <br />Even though it's not Mr. Brown's best work, I still found it an enjoyable read even though I am familiar with the NSA as an organisation, cryptography, programming, etc.
B000002UDB|1.0|After listening to the Magical Mystery Tour,  I got a headache. <br /> <br />Gosh already, I am sooooooo sick of the Beatles. <br /> <br />Are people in a time warp?

B00006RINF|4.0|I bought this CD when I first started getting into goth music and lifestyle about two and a half years ago or so.  When I first listened to it, it impressed me.  Scabbia's vocals are very good, but then I started delving into more bands of the same music.  Now, some people have stated that LC is not Goth, some of that is true, some not.  For one I'd like to state that Goth is not just about wearing all black, writing poetry, and painting your fingernails black(&lt;- I do this, and I'm male:) Goth is about finding yourself, finding a meaning to life, and also, not being afraid of judgement(say no to conformity!)  Music is just one way to express your feelings to the world, as is poetry and art.  Now, back to the CD, it's a pretty good sounding album all in all, but it feels too much like they're trying to break through into the mainstream, something I don't like.  Goth is not supposed to be mainstream, it's supposed to be for the people that feel alone in a sense.  Also, Goth is about music as an art, not as an industry, which is another reason it's not mainstream.  In my opinion, most MTV promoted bands are in it for the money and not the art anymore, notice I wrote MOST.  Mainstream has become to engrossed in who makes the most money with an album instead of focusing on the music in general.  Instead you see bands bringing CD's out every year, which in my opinion is very, very fast to create a good album with good MUSIC!!! <br />Anywho, if you do like LC, I'd recommend there older stuff first, to get a better feel for what they're like, and what they've become.  They're not sell outs and I'd hate to see them become that, would be shame, hopefully they'll take the time to make some quality music on there next album, instead of making an album for people to just like cuz of a certain guitair part or a simple beat. <br />If you do like LC, I'd also recommend Rhea's Obsession, Lycia, Collide and Abney Park for starters.

B00005UK1F|5.0|Masterminded by Tchort (with a silent `T' I presume), former Emperor bassist, this astounding concept album is one 60-minute track.  It is not an album, it is a cohesive, one-hour song.  I ripped the song in ten parts and even so, it is almost impossible to only listen to one part without wanting to hear the next, and the next, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Light of Day, Day of Darkness is impressive beyond comprehension.  The song never becomes technically demanding or too progressive, nor does it ever fall into the trap of becoming clich&eacute; doom rock (which plagues many clones of the genre) with repetitive and unoriginal riffs.  Instead, the album excels with every change in melody.  Kjetil Nordhus's voice, though not amazing, is perfectly morose and bleak for the album's dark and sinister mood.  Employing extra musicians to add numerous musical elements (strings, organs, saxophones, a choir, and a death-metal grunt), Tchort creates an album whose changes keep the music alive and going - not once in this song (except maybe around the 30-minute mark where the woman starts to vocalize) does the energy die.  None of the instruments are ever used too much, nor does any one section ever monopolize the attention.  Additionally, none of the sections are ever too intense or out-of-place.<br /><br />At times, the album may lack a little subtlety, but not so that any one moment sounds out of place.  The influences range from doom-metal to power-metal even to Nordic folk and jazz.  My personal favorite \\"section\\" is the \\"song\\" that last from around the 10-minute mark to the 16-minute mark.  Here, Tchort exhibits acoustic guitars, astounding symphonic accompaniments and a closing riff that could scare the corpse-paint off any black-metal enthusiast.  Here is how I would divide the album (and trust me, this is the best division there is):<br /><br />Part....Start...Finish...Length...Rating (0 = bad, 3 = great)<br />I.......00:02...06:47....6:43.....3<br />II......06:47...11:21....4:34.....3<br />III.....11:21...18:01....6:40.....4<br />IV......18:01...21:54....3:53.....2<br />V.......21:54...32:45...10:51.....3<br />VI......32:45...37:27....4:42.....1<br />VII.....37:27...44:24....6:57.....3<br />VIII....44:24...52:42....8:18.....2<br />IX......52:42...55:20....2:38.....3<br />X.......55:20...60:08....4:48.....2<br /><br />A dark progressive gem in an unlikely genre, Light of Day, Day of Darkness is majestic and sets Tchort apart as a true musician.<br /><br />See also: Green Carnation - A Blessing in Disguise, Agalloch - The Mantle:21...18:01....6:40.....4  IV......18:01...21:54....3:53.....2  V.......21:54...32:45...10:51.....3  VI......32:45...37:27....4:42.....1  VII.....37:27...44:24....6:57.....3  VIII....44:24...52:42....8:18.....2  IX......52:42...55:20....2:38.....3  X.......55:20...60:08....4:48.....2    A dark progressive gem in an unlikely genre, Light of Day, Day of Darkness is majestic and sets Tchort apart as a true musician.

B0001I55SS|4.0|a classic sci-fi flick that offers subtle, yet powerful techniques that enthrall the viewer. From the menacing nature of the ship and its inhabitants to the beauty of one of the co-stars and her psychic relationship to her robotic peer, there is much to love here. Several notable actors, including Tony Perkins, appear in this highly entertaining film.<br /><br />This marks what I consider to be one of the first times that Disney became adventurous and willing to take on darker and more chilling themes than before. The movie is challenging and mysterious and explores some of the more fascinating themes of human to robot interaction that speaks of what is to come.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|It was bound to happen - Nightwish's recording budget increased, and the Finnish quintet added an entire orchestra to their new album, thus forging the most epic and powerful doom album to ever be released.  Like giving a child everything he has ever wanted, the band have let loose their boundless creativity.  The album is very similar to their previous release, Century Child, but with strings, horns and woodwinds in absolutely every nook.  Oh, yes, it is absolutely over-the-top, but in a band such as this, it is fitting and magnificent.<br /><br />The opening song, \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" begins with a pounding metal riff unlike anything else on the album - very reminiscent of \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" or more recent In Flames.  However, it doesn't last.  Soon afterwards, trademark Nightwish power-riffs kick in, infectious and energizing, bringing along with them a parading symphony that does not go unheard.  The last chorus is absolutely beyond belief, with the band almost *dueling* with the symphony in a musical power struggle.  \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" is very similar to \\"Dead to the World\\", with bassist Marko Hietala taking over the vocals in the chorus of this heavy piece.  \\"Nemo\\" (released as two singles) and \\"Planet Hell\\" are Nightwish staples, accessible and tremendously melodic; the latter of which showcases the symphonic textures in a very isolated, gothic atmosphere (\\"Carmina Burana\\" is not a stretched comparison).<br /><br />The album has two longer pieces, both of which are exceptional tracks.  \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\", an 8-minute eulogy to the destruction of native Americans during the colonial period is woeful, slow and touching, building up to becoming a horn-driven hard rocker.<br /><br />But it is nothing in comparison to \\"Ghost Love Score\\", a near 10-minute concoction of tremendous melodic fireworks.  The song left me speechless, and would surely have impressed Carl Orff.  Everything from the chorus to the symphonic bombast to the choirs is absolutely hypnotic and energetic.  The song makes any other song seem pale, ordinary and thoughtless, including the last two tracks on the album.  It is that good.  Sometime after the 4-minute mark, the band stops playing, and leaves the song in the hands of a passionate symphony, culminating with the band's re-entry into the song.  The choirs that aid in the choral delivery are mostly female, and absolutely majestic.  The song is theatrical and truly unrivaled.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest (and a bit cynical), the symphony in the album takes a little too much credit.  The guitar-work on the album is far from impressive and, if the orchestra were removed, many songs would sound very similar.  If it weren't for Turunen's voice and the orchestral onslaught, Once would be quite ordinary.  Regardless, it is the symphonic album of the year, and the best of Nightwish's career thus far.  My congratulations go to keyboardist/songwriter Tuomas Holopainen and his magnum opus.<br /><br />See also: Nightwish - Wishmaster, Nightwish - Century Child.

B00003CWTI|1.0|I wish I had the three hours of my life back that I wasted on this movie.  The characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting.  The opening works hard to set up some big cosmic payoff that will link all the lives and coincidences together into something coherent, but it never happens.  Tom Cruise's character is ludicrous and Julianne Moore is literally unwatchable.  And then there's the frogs.  Somehow, nothing says that the director didn't know where to go with the film quite like having really big frogs falling from the sky.  The best thing about this movie is that Aimee Mann did the music and the only truly excellent scene in the whole 3 hours is the few seconds where all the characters (even the unconscious ones) sing along to one of her songs. <br />
B0006IIPIK|3.0|The 2004 sci-fi film \\"Sky Captain and the World Tomorrow\\" was Kerry Conran's directorial & authorial debut.  Set around the year 1939, the story creates a highly fictitious world that is seemingly free of Nazis in Germany (they are certainly never mentioned), but does mention fighting in Asia, though Japan is never directly mentioned as being involved.  Instead, in this near-utopian vision of 1939, passengers travel from Europe to New York aboard a dirigible named the \\"Hindenburg III\\" that lands by attaching itself to the never-used airship landing cone on top of the Empire State Building.  (In this idealized setting, passengers disembark the airship via a long stairs over 100 floors above the streets below with no concern about winds that could easily blow the airship--and them--into a very precarious position.)  The film then focuses upon the first of its three principal characters: a newspaper reporter by the name of Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), who becomes interested in the disappearance of six noted scientists around the globe.  All of them had worked together on a secret German project before WWI, but only one of the original seven was still free: Dr. Jennings (Trevor Baxter).  Polly meets Dr. Jennings at a theater playing \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", but everyone is interrupted by an onslaught of giant, flying robots that attack New York; to which, a panicked radio operator sends an immediate plea for help to the film's second principal character known as Sky Captain (Jude Law).  He rushes to New York in his highly advanced British Spitfire and eventually comes across Polly, who had previously dated him.  Once the giant robot threat subsides, Sky Captain and Polly travel to his secret airbase where is faithful and highly inventive assistant, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), has been studying the robots; but their arrival is interrupted by another robotic attack, which is lead by a mysterious woman (Ling Bai).  Being very resourceful, Dex is able to determine that the robotsare being controlled from somewhere in Shangri-La.  To have enough fuel to reach Shangri-La, Sky Captain and Polly are assisted by the film's third principal character: an officer in the British Royal Air Force, Franky (Angelina Jolie), that commands the equivalent of a flying aircraft carrier.  It is up to them to find out who is controlling the robots and what his fiendish plot may be. <br /> <br />\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" may be the first film to have been shot almost entirely in front of blue screens because aside from the human actors, everything else is computer-generated graphics.  The robots, flapping-wing planes, flying aircraft carriers and planes that can travel underwater are all very impressive special effects, but visual effects alone cannot define the overall quality of a film, especially when the story (which is set in a fictitious representation of the past) feels dated from the get-go and too unrealistic to fully engage an audience.  Had this film been produced in the late 1930's (of course, without the aid of computer graphics), the story would have probably been similar to the early Buck Rogers serials of the period and probably had been better received by an audience unfamiliar with today's technological advancements.  However, creating such a film today, though visually impressive, simply fell short of what a most people in a twenty-first century audience expect.  Consequently, my overall rating for \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is 3 out of 5 stars.  Clearly, Kerry Conran is a highly creative individual and I expect to see more visually impressive films from him in the future.

B0002858YS|5.0|This Las Vegas 4-some really get it right.  The energy is high and the influence is late 70s new wave.  Aside from perhaps 2 songs, all the tracks are good.  This record is definatly recommended.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californication is a simply amazing album by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They try on many different styles here in this album, and seem to excel at all of them. <br />   <br />The opening song on Californication, \\"Around the World\\", is a great funk tune. Many more such songs can be found here, such as \\"Get on top\\". The driving bass of these songs serves as a steady foundation on which John Frusciante lays down an array of memorable guitar riffs. These fun tunes seemingly lay a foundation for the ups and downs of this album. <br /> <br />The beauty that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have created in their mellow songs is astounding. They take elements of their funk such as the driving bass and drums and combine it with beautiful choruses and guitar to leave you in awe of their musical genius. The mellow pieces of this album, such as \\"Otherside\\", \\"Scartissue\\", and \\"Californication\\" will remain with you for a long time. <br /> <br />Another interesting style is an acoustic Zeppelin-esque tone in \\"Road Trippin'\\". The Red Hot Chili Peppers make this style their own by taking their mellow style tunes and layering it with acoustic guitar and a symphonic backdrop. <br /> <br />This was my first Red Hot Chili Peppers Album, but it certainly will not be my last. I definitely reccomend this album to everyone, because what sets this album apart is not that it contains so many different styles, but how the band can seemingly take any style and make it their own.

068484267X|5.0|<br />\\"The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live.\\" <br />--Frank McCourt <br /> <br />Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is a thrilling memoir that enlightens the reader with tales of his childhood in the impoverished towns of Brooklyn, New York and Limerick, Ireland. McCourt grew up during the late 1930s and 1940s and faced several conflicts such as hunger, death, his father's alcoholism, and illness. While amongst the lower-class, he faces opposition with people in all positions of authority such as schoolmasters, priests, and family members. However this does not make Frank's goal of rising up from poverty and leaving Ireland impossible.  <br /> <br />Frank McCourt tells his story in an eccentric intriguing style. He mixes humor and wit with the harsh experiences of his childhood while also informing the reader of the stereotypical Irish lifestyle. The memoir is told in the present tense and written as though he is experiencing specific events that very moment. \\"I'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. . . . Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.\\" This gives the reader a sense of the emotions he was facing at the time and lets you picture the event taking place. He also aligns the tone of the text with his progressing age. McCourt ties in the themes of family, love, religion, and social relationships, drawing the reader into his tragic life. \\"My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk\\". His writing style gives the reader the opportunity to see the care for family, Church and society, dedication, tragedy of alcoholism, and the harshness of life in Ireland. <br /> <br />Angela's Ashes is a story of survival of the spirit and body and an unforgettable memoir of a boy searching for a childhood in a world where he is forced to take on adult responsibilities. Frank McCourt, the book's author, narrator, and protagonist, tells his own life story from the perspective of an adolescent looking out onto the world. His early childhood consisted of his mother, Angela, struggling to feed her growing sons, paying the wages, and coping with the deaths of her young daughter. His childhood is a time of some adventure and continued deprivation. After the tragic death of his younger sister the family moved back home to Ireland. Soon enough Frank witnessed the death of his two brothers.  <br />He faces several conflicts such as hunger, neglect, his alcoholic father, oppressive weather, poverty, starvation and harassment. However, Frank remains strong. McCourt descriptively shares his memories of searching for coal along the streets, begging for food, and the ruthless, cold nights. Frank increasingly condemns his father's irresponsibility but worries also about the morality of his own behavior. He determines to make a success of himself in America. He portrays an independent, determined young boy who eventually found himself as the \\"man of the house\\" instead of his own father. Frank still loves his father regardless of his alcoholic habits. When his father's attempt to earn money in England fails, Frank finds work on his own. This gives him the feeling of responsibility and lets him dream of hope for providing his family with food and clothes. Frank soon faces conflict again when his family moves in with Angela's cousin, Laman. A sexual relationship between the two is formed which brings anger to Frank. Frank soon starts a sexualrelationship of his own with one of his customers, who soon dies of consumption, leaving Frank with a broken heart. Near the end, a priest pardons Frank of all his sins. This allows Frank to leave for America with a clear conscience and to take hold of his thoughts for his potential future. At this point, Frank's dream of leaving Ireland and overcoming poverty becomes possible. Even though he is sad of leaving his family back in Ireland, he earns enough money to move to New York and bid his farewell to Ireland. Angela's Ashes is a beautifully written memoir. The story captures your heart and gives you an idea of the hardships faced in our past.  <br /> <br />Frank McCourt brought numerous emotions to the reader. The fast moving memoir allows you to picture the tragedies as if they were happening right before your eyes. With great detail, you can create images within your mind of the dark streets of Ireland and rough living styles. As a result of the incomparable life in the 1900s, the reader is pulled into Frank McCourt's personal experiences, investing every emotion. His description of his life is matchless. Angela's Ashes won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics' Circle Award, and spent 117 weeks on The New York Times hardcover best-seller list. Angela's Ashes serves as a living record of the strong moral values and sense of humor McCourt maintained despite the suffering and despair he suffered as a child.  <br /> <br />\\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all.\\" <br />--Frank McCourt <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I have listened to the album about 3 times now and it is growing on me. This growth follows the pattern of almost all of the group's previous albums. This album is like a profound book written by a genius of an author. You have to really put in all your senses into it for a listen and then it reveals its gems more and more with each listen. This one is definitely not for those who occasional dabble in Metheny or tout his so called more musical tunes. In some ways I feel that this album is  subtly meant to filter out the \\"light\\" listeners who go in for just the \\"sound bites\\" as he mentions on the group's website. But for the initiated it is another stepping stone in a musically enriching experience that makes one listen in wonder and admire the vision of a musician who refuses to tow the commercial line. If Metheny had followed the advice of some of the negative reviewers here he would never have taken any chances and we would never have gems such as \\"Upramp\\", etc. I for one am glad that he follows his musical vision unlike so many other jazz musicians who play  tired cliches in so called traditional jazz, that sell well commercially, over and over again.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|I think that acdc is one of the best rock bands ever. they're no black sabbath or led zeppelin but holy crap. This debut album is awsome. The bagpipe solo on Its a long way to the top (if you wanna rock n roll) is wierd but acdc can pull it off because... Theyre acdc. The great thing about ac dc is theyre all fifty some years old and they still play every couple years. Word is theyre makin a new cd and its comin out within a year. Back to the cd it is great. Angus Youngs guitar solos were unbelievable. Malcolm Young can keep rythem unlike some back up guitars. Bon Scott is unbelievable With his smokey voice that sounds so good with acdc. Phill Rudds great drumming capability is crazy. And you cant forget Mark Evens great bass playing that puts the great sound you hear. All Around This is acdcs best album.
B000000OSE|5.0|The 1991 release, \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" is superb. This album put GNR back near the top of the rock world with the 16 song album. This one is much stronger rock wise than its predecessor, \\"Use Your Illusion II\\", as it provides fans with the raw, viciousness they got in \\"Appetite For Destruction\\". As usual, we hear some brilliant guitar solos from Slash and we also hear some outstanding ballads.<br /><br />1. Right Next Door To Hell: This song can be easily described in one word. Heavy. This track is loud, quick and edgy. Everything you want from Guns n' Roses. I love it. 9.5/10<br /><br />2. Dust n' Bones: This song isn't as heavy as the first, but it possesses a strong melodic feel to it with a good chorus built in. It becomes it bit dull by the end. 8.5/10<br /><br />3. Live and Let Die: A cover from Paul and Linda McCartney's power ballad, GNR makes their version a little heavier, and they put a little more emphasis on the lyrics. Overall, a good cover. 9/10<br /><br />4. Don't Cry(original): This heavy ballad is melodic, touching and meaningful. A wonderful chorus which may sound sappy but is genuine. One of the best in the GNR collection. 10/10<br /><br />5. Perfect Crime: This is quick, nasty and awesome. GNR brings out some of their loudest stuff in this track and also Slash finds a way to slip in one hell of a guitar solo as well. 9.5/10<br /><br />6. You ain't the first: You're gonna read a lot of bad reviews about this one, but honestly I don't think it's that bad. It's a decent acoustic guitar tune and the song-writing from Izzy Stradlin isn't too poor. 7.5/10<br /><br />7. Bad Obession: This song I'm not expecially fond of. It lacks the edgy rock you wanna hear from GNR. The chorus is OK, but it doesn't having anything special to it in terms of the tune. 7/10<br /><br />8. Back Off Bitch: This is the kind of rock you like to hear from GNR. A hard, heavy rock n' roll tune is highlighted by the number of times you get to hear Axl sing: \\"B-tch!' 9/10<br /><br />9. Double Talkin' Jive: This is a great song written by Stradlin. It contains an upbeat, jiving quality to it with a very catchy chorus to it. 9/10<br /><br />10. November Rain: This is song is a masterpiece. Rose wrote a brilliant ballad as he sings in a touching tone about a girlfriend. This is their best ballad and in the Top 5 for best GNR songs. 10/10<br /><br />11. The Garden: You have to listen to this tune a few times before you really get into it. I love the assistance of Alice Cooper on lyrics. Although he doesn't sing, he offers a spooky delivery of the twisted chorus. Rose keeps the song going with his usual screeching singing, however he keeps it quite light in this track. 9/10<br /><br />12. Garden of Eden: This is an exciting, fast-paced, energetic tune where Rose is near impossible to understand as he delivers the lyrics at an extraordinary speed. 8.5/10<br /><br />13. Don't Damn Me: A rock tune that isn't too heavy but keeps you listening. Its highlight comes up when the song is suddenly pulled from its original pace and is slowed down as Rose sings: \\"I know you don't wanna hear me crying\\". 8.5/10<br /><br />14. Bad Apples: Outside of the chorus, I don't care for this song. 7/10<br /><br />15. Dead Horse: The most depressing song in GNR's catalog has a strong opening with nice guitar. The lead in to the chorus is done well. 8.5/10<br /><br />16. Coma: A fantastic 10 minute song, with an incredible bass intro. We hear voices from all over the place in this one and Slash delivers one great solo. Axl keeps the song moving with his impressive delivery on lyrics. One of my all time favourites. 10/10ch!' 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Double Talkin' Jive: This is a great song written by Stradlin. It contains an upbeat, jiving quality to it with a very catchy chorus to it. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. November Rain: This is song is a masterpiece. Rose wrote a brilliant ballad as he sings in a touching tone about a girlfriend. This is their best ballad and in the Top 5 for best GNR songs. 10/10 <br /> <br />11.

Its highlight comes up when the song is suddenly pulled from its original pace and is slowed down as Rose sings: \\"I know you don't wanna hear me crying\\". 8.5/10 <br /> <br />14. Bad Apples: Outside of the chorus, I don't care for this song. 7/10 <br /> <br />15. Dead Horse: The most depressing song in GNR's catalog has a strong opening with nice guitar. The lead in to the chorus is done well. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />16. Coma: A fantastic 10 minute song, with an incredible bass intro. We hear voices from all over the place in this one and Slash delivers one great solo. Axl keeps the song moving with his impressive delivery on lyrics. One of my all time favourites. 10/10
0767836324|5.0|The very concept of family entertainment just doesn't get better than this film!!  I have to admit, I've never actually seen the original Disney version of Peter Pan but after watching this \\"remake\\" I would have to believe that the audience would probably get a stronger feel for the underlining power of the messages the original story is trying to bring out.  And in my opinion, there's not a single filmmaker in history that can bring these kinds of messages to the screen better than Steven Spielberg!! Here we have a grown up Peter Banning taken back to his \\"roots\\", shall we say, as Peter Pan as well as to rescue his kids from the infamous Captian Hook in never neverland. Along the way he rediscovers the true power of childhood friendship and imagination.  IMHO Spielberg is really at his best working with this kind of material.  He's always done a great job at balancing out visually and emotionally the \\"earthly\\" world from the childlike essence of his \\"outer\\" world and even at times, bringing them together(Jurassic Park).  I don't think you have to look any farther than Close Encounters of the Third Kind for evidence of that.  I think Spielberg is one that really gets a kick out of playing with our emotions.  I even remembered during an interview that when talking about a scene from Close Encounters, he really never considered the rationality of the scene as much as how he thought it would look visually or feel emotinally.  Kinda brings note to how we experience the world as a child in the first place!! And not to take anything away from his ability to tell stories about the real world because there's absolutely no denying the power of classics such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, or The Color Purple.  But it is indeed his fascination and understanding of childlike innocence that, along with this beautiful film, brings out the child in all of us!!

I meant my husband at 23 and we spent 20 years together and even through it wasn't always perfect and didn't end well, I knew he understood me and wanted the best for me.  Now being single again and trying to figure how to date, this book is a language guide for me.  I wouldn't go to France without a Langurage guide, why would I attempt dating without one.  I am going to buy and send this book to every single female I know from 18 - 81.  It's clear, it's easy and I have faith that it is true.  Wow thank you so much Greg Behrendt for writing this book it's clear, very very clear.  Women we hear it every day from male co-workers, male family members and male friends, we look for too much in stuff and make excuses to settle for less when our own gut tells us \\"I know your lonely, but run, run as far and fast as you can from this guy\\".  He's not the jerk we are.

I didn't realize by just watching the movie \\"The dark Crystal\\" how much detail, and thought is behind this amazing story.  This book takes you FAR past what you see in the movie. This book not only has a large amount of literature, it also has just as much illustration-artwork.  <br />I couldn't possibly begin to explain the amount of information in this book, so you'll just have to see it for yourself!  <br />A brilliant book, and a MUST HAVE for fantasy collectors!!

B0006IIKS0|5.0|Most documentaries on musicians rarely rise above the level of an episode of VH1's Behind-the-Music. They are either self-congratulatory puff pieces or tabloid fodder that dwells mostly on salacious aspects. Granted, the recent documentary, Dig  is one of the rare exceptions. Residing somewhere in the middle is Metallica: Some Kind of Monster. This documentary chronicles the band's rocky road of making and releasing the album St. Anger. For a band that had a reputation of controlling every aspect of their careers (including the notorious battle against Napster), it was somewhat of a surprise that they would allow two documentary filmmakers, Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, to show them warts and all.<br /><br />The first disc features two audio commentaries. The members of Metallica are on the first one and fall into the trap of watching the movie as opposed to commentating on it. Things pick on the second commentary track with the filmmakers, Berlinger and Sinofsky. The filmmakers recount many stories behind the doc and provide a good inside look at how it was put together, including their own internal strife that mirrored the one between James and Lars. As the filming went on Berlinger and Sinofsky closely identified with their subjects and what they were going through.<br /><br />The second disc features 28 additional scenes with some of them including optional commentary by Berlinger and Sinofsky. There is also a lot more footage of the band working on St. Anger as well as a good bit where Lars finally tells off Dr. Phil and Kirk goes to traffic school.<br /><br />\\"Festivals and Premieres\\" features footage of the filmmakers and the band participating at Q&A sessions for various film festivals, including Sundance. It is interesting to see the band clearly enjoying this new venue and how they view the film after some time as passed.<br /><br />\\"This Monster Lives\\" is 13 additional scenes, including an alternate version of the meeting between Lars and Dave Mustaine.<br /><br />Also included is a music video with footage from the documentary.<br /><br />Finally, there are filmographies for the filmmakers.Mustaine. <br /> <br />Also included is a music video with footage from the documentary. <br /> <br />Finally, there are filmographies for the filmmakers.

Half of the book is \\"good\\" fairies featuring artwork of the specific fairy, and some information about each one. This is the really COOL part......you flip the book over, then upside down, and it becomes the \\"bad\\" fairies! What a neat concept for a book! Of my entire collection of Froud books, this is my favorite. If you're starting a fantasy book collection, or shopping for your first Brian Froud book, start here, you won't be disappointed!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B00006879E|1.0|Before Maroon5  set out to make songs about jane, I imagine they had a conversation that sounded something like this:  Maroon 5 Member #1: Well,ain't looking too good boys. What do we do next?     Member #2: Beats me, I'm tapped out.  Member #3: Me too.    Member #1: OK, let's make an album full of weird sounds and moaning. People won't know what to make of it, so they'll say that it's brilliant.  Member #2: Works for me.   Member #3: Excellent.    Alright, they probably didn't have that conversation, but if they did, the result would have been this album. It's tough to find anything to praise about Sons of Jane. How much you'll like it depends on how well you tolerate pretentious art. Do you find meaning and pleasure in a painting consisting of paint balls splatted on canvas? If so, here's the album for you. It's all about atmosphere, apparently. The moody tones, beeps, moans and random horns creating a sense of being stuck in traffic, and all the drivers are wishing they would die. Yippee!    This isn't music, this is atmosphere, and harshly unpleasant atmosphere at that. I'm truly at a loss to describe how mind-numbingly bad this is, but I'll try. If you don't like melody, buy this album. If you like skittering, slithering rythms with nothing else adorning them, buy this album. If you like non-musical bursts and bleeps of sound, buy this album. If you can't stand guitars, audible lyrics, or any identifiable instrument, buy this album.ow, don't give me negative votes for not liking Maroon 5 ok ?  I really listened to this straight, and this album is very boring, meaningless, and weird in a bad way. The vocals are bad, and this is techno. If you like it, that's your business, but I think this is overrated, and very bad.   I tried to get in the album, but it's not very good driving music, or listen-to-it-in-the-kitchen-while-cooking music either. It's like a wall of unmemorable blips and noises that comes off as being very thoughtfully put together, but devoid of emotion and passion. I still have the album (no idea why), I think I'll go trade it in this afternoon. It's bottom of the barrel as far as I'm concerned  Well after many listens I've lost patience and I've come to the conclusion this album is just awful, and there's no doubt that some (not all) of the reviewers here are talking from their rather potent derriere portals. Don't get me wrong... I believe that some of the reviewers really do like this -but I sincerely believe that for some others , if this wasn't Maroon 5, they'd be giving somewhat more critical reviews (and scratching their heads). I'm not some sort of musical expert, but I'll take a wild stab in the dark that you've got to have tunes/melody as a foundation to build the delivery, arrangement and style on(it's why Gary Barlow will always be around). For me, that's where Songs about Jane really fails miserably; it's just not got that strong musical base -rather it's built on a rambling collection of electronic beeps. And I just don't like beeping -and certainly not as a placebo for real tunes. Take away the electronic beat beeping and what have you got? In my opinion a beeping collection of melodies that makes 'n Sync sound like immense musical giants of our age (at least they have harmony, but I dangerously digress).  alright folks, we need to quit listening to the artsy-fartsy critics trying to tell us how \\"revolutionary\\" this album is. These critics had led us to believe that it is so amazing that if we do not appreciate it, it's due to our own ignorance for art-rock. After making myself listen to this album just to find some redeeming quality, all I could dig up was the studio musicians they hired to play real instruments, only so they could play with it enough to make it slightly less distinguishable. The lyrics are repetitive, and his voice, quite annoying. Now if the words contained in the booklet underneath the disc-tray were the lyrics in the songs, This would be a wonderful CD, instead it's his whiny voice droning over some electronic noise they must have concocted in just a few hours.    This album is a shining example of how... can save a music lover fromwasting money on over-rated trash. The songs all sound like someonesmoked some crack and entered a recording studio without instrumentsand pushed buttons on every keyboard they could find. Some here callit \\"abstract\\"...but I call it unlistenable. This cd is proofthat if critics rave about an album, it's best to leave it in thestore. This group needs to listen to their first album again andremember what it's like to write a \\"song.\\" This group istrying too hard to be hip and strange, and it leaves the listenerwondering what in the world are these guys smoking or injecting. Atleast U2 stopped their experimenting and recorded  a crappy newalbum...  This is trash ~ they ought to give it away for free~ why anyone would pay anything for this is beyond me. Resembles a gang of infants who cut loose on a set of synthesizers. No musical value. For those who buy, do yourself a favor and take some aspirin before you play it, you'll be glad you did.    All I'm saying is that it didn't entertain me - the majority of people out there seem to love it, just like some people love Finnegans Wake, and others don't. Therefore, Songs about Jane is a very subjective album, like English Literature - it can mean a number of things to a number of people. Yet, like English Literature, if one doesn't look for the subtext and the hidden themes, it's just plain boring (see: Middlemarch). Listening to Sons of Jane, I have searched for a subtext but I haven't found one, which probably just boils down to my fledgling perspicacity. As Beth Massa said: \\"The band's future-perfect musical grammar may be hard to decipher, and the melody is even more subliminal,\\" but I, like many people, don't have the patience to sit and listen to something that fails to at least get my toes tapping or me singing along. So, many people may love subliminal melodies and indecipherable grammar, but not this cowboy.
B000002ADT|5.0|And I mean that.  Over ten years ago, I was younger and knew nothing about jazz at the time.  I went to the record shop and decided to invest in my first jazz album.  I picked up the 'Kind of Blue' album and when I got home, I realized that I had found the one album that would begin what was to become my favorite music genre... and it'll do the same for you.  <br />After 100s of listenings of the first track &quot;So What&quot;,  I've memorized every note played by Miles, John and Cannonball.  I also play alto sax and can play the solos with it.  <br />Over 200 jazz albums later,  and many of them by Miles, I still consider 'Kind of Blue'  my all-time favorite.
B000069AUI|1.0|As a 74 year old musciologist I have seen many outrages during my lifetime, like World War 2, Pol Pot, Western Exploitation and Stravinsky's 'Rite of Passage' but this album certainly surpasses anything in the 20th century and barring the extinction of the human race (although it does come close) will see out the 21st as the greatest crime ever perpertrated against humanity and more specifically Gary Barlow. When I first heard this 'A Rush of Thievery from Chris Martion' I was shaking with anger for 27 days and 8 hours. I had to put into a seclusion unit with 5 doses of horse tranquiliser a day just to calm me down. Now a year on I am on a mere two doses. <br />Where to start? First of all, this album robs off that album which transcends music and for many of us music scholar represents the holy grail of music, yes it is of course the towering 'Open Road'. Was this band as naive to think that it would not be noticed? Emotionally this album does not complete me like Open Road. Chris' shreiking high nasal girlie voice does not do justice to the material that it has not being ripped off from, nor does it capture its majesty or magic of 'Open Road'. File this one under- 'Outrages me to the very core of my existence'.
B00005B1W7|4.0|This being the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, there has been much media attention given the Holocaust of late, from PBS and BBC's tremendous six-hour documentary series, Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State to Daniel Anker's documentary for AMC, Imaginary Witness: Hollywood and the Holocaust, about the thorny relationship between the Hollywood dream factory and events of the not-so-distant past. <br /> <br />Looking at QB VII today, it's amazing how dated it looks on a purely technical (read: superficial) level - the style of filmmaking (or lack of style, if you prefer), the awkward framing, the grainy film stock, etc. <br /> <br />Content is what's important, though, and while the disc has no choice but to live with the film elements of the day - a proper film restoration would have proven frightfully expensive, I imagine, though I for one would have considered it money well spent - there's no denying that this is compelling, powerful drama. <br /> <br />QB VII was made at a time when the TV mini-series was still in its infancy; if I recall, Rich Man, Poor Man was the watercooler show of the day, and Roots had yet to be aired. <br /> <br />And yet, when I look back - I was 13 at the time QB VII played on TV - this miniseries has stuck in my memory where others have faded. Credit is due to Leon Uris, of course, but what I find compelling - all the more so, today - is the eternal moral dilemma of whether it's possible to redeem a past sin through good works, or whether there are certain sins so awful they can never be redeemed. <br /> <br />Parallels have been drawn between Anthony Hopkins's Dr. Kelno in this film and Dr. Josef Mengele in real life (an irredeemable historical figure, if ever there was one) - but the parallel I believe to be more apt is with Leni Riefenstahl, \\"Hitler's filmmaker,\\" as she was known at the time, who first sang the praises of the Nazi state in her propaganda films and then devoted her post-war career to photographing the Dinka tribes of Sudan. <br /> <br />QB VII poses a tough moral question, and reaches a similarly tough conclusion. Some sins are beyond redemption, Uris argues, especially if there is no effort to admit guilt or atone publicly for past sins. <br /> <br />Uris wrote novels that are far better known than QB VII, lord knows - Exodus, for one. For me, though, this is the one that has stood the test of time. I fear QB VII is more relevant today than it has ever been. War criminals from the Nazi era continue to be exposed, aging older men who are living lives of relative anonymity. Inevitably the person's neighbours say, once the truth is know, 'Hey, he's an old man, he's harmless, that was a long time ago, let bygones be bygones.' <br /> <br />Never, Uris says, and QB VII shows why. The death camp footage - actual newsreel footage that survived the war - is unforgetable. <br /> <br />I wish this DVD were a perfect visual transfer, with pristine stereo sound (Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is astonishing, and has always been one of my favourites of his) but that was never likely to happen. I'm glad to have this DVD in my library, in any event. <br /> <br />There are many films and TV miniseries about the Holocaust that are more famous and better known, but if I had my way this is the one that would be shown in schools, in history classes. At the very least, it would prompt some important questions and provoke a lively debate.
0684857219|5.0|In reading some of the reviews, I can see that so many people are trying to judge this book based on what is best for them, not necessarily what is best for everybody. But first of all, let's take a look at who wrote this book and his accomplishments...ARNOLD! <br /> <br />I met Arnold back in the 1970's. What fascinated me most was his his honesty about anabolic steriods, a subject everyone was anxious to ask him about. Arnold indicated that all of the top bodybuilders use steriods but at best, they only help about 5%. Arnold also went on to say that he won his first two Mr. Universe (Mister Un-E-Verse as Arnold would pronounce it) without steriods. <br /> <br />Arnold also indicated that he had to \\"shock\\" his muscles by working from different angles and changing routines. Sometimes he would start off his chest routine with bench presses. Other times he would let bench presses slide and do inclines instead. <br /> <br />Off season, Arnold trains a bodypart (or at least did back then) twice per week but would move that up to three times per week pre contest to bring out maximum muscularity. I understand that this is the way Arnold trained for his Terminator movie as well and Arnie gained 12 lbs of solid muscle ina  very short time  while reducing his bodyfat level. This guys system works! <br /> <br />When Arnold came to the US back in 1968,  it wasn't steriods that transformed him as some reviews have indicated. As Arnold himself said, Steriods only help about 5% and take away the steriods and the top guys would still be the top guys even without steriods. What really transformed Arnold was his change in training technique. Training a bodypart more times per week (from twice to three times), training the calves heavy, working up to 1,000 lbs on calf raises as advised by his hero the great Reg Park. Doing aerobic exercise like running 2 miles along the beach three times per week, doinga double split routine, training twice per day to burn up more calories. Hitting amuscle from many angles, using cables and isolation exercises etc. <br /> <br />Arnold was also focused on becomming the greatest ever. After a narrow loss to Sergio Oliva in 1969, Arnold became obsessed with dethroning Sergio and he did in 1970 defeating Sergio twice in two weeks and then again in 1972.  <br /> <br />Probably the one thing that made Arnold the big star that he did become was his mental attitude which carried over well to making Arnold a huge film star, best selling author and now governor. The man wins at everything he sets his mind to because he is like a machine and once he sets a goal he stays committed to it. We all can learn from that alone. <br /> <br />Arnold's system works. Look what it did for Arnold and his buddy Franco Columbo not to mention countless others. It may very well transform your physique as well. And perhaps you may make a movie, smoke a cigar, write best selling books and run for governor too (only kidding)!!!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|In a nutshell: Sky Captain is entertaining, PG rated family movie that's fun for parents and kids.  There's not even a hint of sexual material, but there are a few cuss words that could have been left out and one scene when an old scientist gets scorched down to a charred skeleton.  It's a bit long, but it held the interest of my two kids under the age of seven. <br /> <br />Sky Captain is a fun and romantic throw-back to the dark and seedy film-noir styles so popular in the 50's.  It's filmed in an almost black-and-white style, set sometime just before WWII, yet tosses in so much science fiction that it's more futuristic then historic.  I would say that 95% of what you see is CGI generated, and the total effect is down-right entertaining. <br /> <br />It's a larger then life, completely fictional tail of hero and heroin on an impossible mission to save the world.  Get ready to suspend your disbelief on many occasions, as the entire story line is so creatively impossible it's almost absurd.  But once you accept that this is what the director Kerry Conran intended, then you'll be able to enjoy it for what it is: a film-noir science fiction fantasy. <br /> <br />Is it worth adding to your collection?  Ummm... I plan to, but maybe you should rent it first and decide for yourself. <br />
B0000X61VE|5.0|Yes! Her workouts are challenging. This video unjustly got hit with negative reviews just because some number of folks, likely VERY out of shape people, showed up at a chiropractor for back injuries. Of course they will have back injuries if they, instead of starting slow, began vigorous exercise routine right away.  Some also claim that Cindy is not performing the exercises correctly. If that was the case, don't you think that she would have back injuries as well?    The workouts are designed to give you a nice combo of cardio with weight training. YOU WILL BE SORE each and every time. If you are a beginner you must take it slow. Also, a note for guys: you can use this video too, just use heavier weights.    Have fun with this workout. You WILL shape up.

There is no connection between heavy and melodic in their styles, it's just p***y rock. This band, I'm proud to say, is able to go between the genres very easily. I still like the other bands, but to say that this band is ripping them off, or that they are any better is just stupid. This band is FAR more energetic than those combined. Unfortunately, I don't feel this release is as good as their previous.

B00006EXL5|5.0|This band is one of the most energetic and hardest to label bands I've ever heard. I listen to lots of stuff from glam rock to tech metal to hardcore to punk and these guys are just impossible to label. They are purely original in every way. <br /> <br />\\"In all seriousness though, this band and it's members really are twats, just like two other bands Sparta and Thursday. In fact they sound exactly like them\\" <br /> <br />I am not a big fan of Thursday, but ever since At The Drive-In broke up, I've been a huge fan of Sparta. Sparta sounds NOTHING like this band at all, so this reviewer must be out of his mind. Not to mention, Sparta is one of the greatest bands of all time. <br /> <br />\\"Track number 3, Vampires Will Never Harm You, may just be the most ridulous track I've heard from a band in the past few years, lines like 'put a stake through me!!' sound like the were written by a comedian making fun of goths on a sketch show. The lines aren't said tongue in cheek or with and detection of sarcasm so you can't help how the hell could anyone seriously write these off as good lyrics.\\" <br /> <br />You obviously have never written lyrics or done anything creative in your life. I bet you flunked 5th grade english too. It's a little thing called symbolism. Maybe if you had some depth in your thoughts, you might be able to realize that the song is about being in love, not friggin' vampires. Some people just have no idea what music is about. *cough* <br /> <br />\\"Then the band is as misleading as can be, you think you're through with the same old same old hardcore whiny songs when the track 'This is The Best Day Ever' comes on but you're met with another song trying to test a listener's endurance.\\" <br /> <br />That's why the tracks are listed on the cd, my dear chum.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a loser who goes to high school and is treated fairly well considering how much of a loser he is.  He wears t-shirts tucked into perfectly-fit jeans, the bottoms of which are tucked into snowboots, which is interesting considering not a flake of snow falls in the entire film, although he is from Idaho, where perhaps snow is something that if it's not falling outside, it's falling in your mind.  His one friend is Pedro, the only Latin-American student in a school filled with blonde-haired, blue-eyed wunderkinds.   <br /> <br />Actually the people who makeup the school, and the surrounding town, are quite fascinating.  They're not gorgeous, or classically beautiful, but grotesque.  That is; they could be beautiful, or at least considered attractive, but there's an element of ugliness to them, some sort of black smudge on the colorful canvas.  Napoleon is emblematic of this in that he is grotesque himself; his hair is curly and uncontrollable, his clothes are almost purposefully unattractive, his slouch and his half-closed eyes make him look as unalert as a rock.  So is everyone around him; unalert to the qualities that make them grotesque (although that is essentially what being grotesque is; you have to not know you are). <br /> <br />Enough about grotesqueries!  Pedro decides to run for class president to bring balance to the darkness that is the other candidate, the plucky Summer.  She is the \\"most popular girl\\" in school, and is surely a lock to win.  The futility of Pedro's chances of winning lend a pity to his character that we might feel for Napoleon if he wasn't so blatantly unconcerned with his own popularity.  Pedro has no idea what to say in his pre-election speech; but Napoleon says, either out of exasperation or genuine concern, \\"Tell them if they vote for you then all their wildest dreams will come true.\\"  Hmm.  Sounds like a throwaway line at first, but Pedro delivers it at the end of a speech that is sure to lose him the election.It makes you wonder why he really cares about winning the election, especially since he seemed to understand how futile it all was.  To make things even more hopeless, after his speech, he must deliver a skit.  A skit?  Pedro has no clue, and he's even less animated than Napoleon. <br /> <br />Then comes one of the most touching scenes I have ever seen.  Napoleon gives a dance-mix tape to the guy running the PA, goes on stage, and dances to \\"Canned Heat.\\"  Then you realize that underneath that facade of unawareness and passivity is a genuine friend.  He basically lays his life on the line if you think about it; for how would the entire school treat him afterwards if they took it the wrong way?  He could barely set foot in that High School if it failed, his life would be made miserable day after day.  But it works!  They roar with applause; and Pedro becomes class president. <br /> <br />Amazingly all ends meet, in a movie without a punchline.  What happens to Napoleon now though?  I assume he keeps going down his own path, where he'll stumble into greatness, whether he knows it or not. <br />
0743454529|5.0|And I feel both elated and depressed.  Elated to have ingested what was quite possibly the best novel I have read.  And depressed because it is finished.  The beauty of reading a book by Jodi Picoult, is that when you are done, you are undoubtedly smarter.  Each one of her books deals with a topic in a way that is new and untouched - whether it be family and obligation (My Sister's Keeper), the Amish community (Plain Truth), or the paranormal (Second Glances).  My Sister's Keeper explores the obligations of family under duress and how people deal with the uncertainty of life.  There is no way to describe this book other than fantastic, moving, touching, and surprising.  More than one twist will keep any reader on their toes.  I am looking forward to meeting Picoult on her tour in March.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This film is absolutely deplorable.  Sloppy filmmaking aside, the perversion of truths and events to create this sham of a political statement is criminal.      For those who have seen the film, please review the following information:    The following .pdf link is the findings of the Indepedence Institute, a non-partisan group that spends a great deal of time debunking falsities from both right and left. (Do a little research on the group if you question their lack of biases.)    [...]    If you read the above document in full, then I can only hope you feel the same disgust for this film and it's creator.  By the true definition, terrorism has no direct tie to violence and murder, and in the true sense of the word, I hope you can see that this film is terrorism in its purest form.    I am sure that the majority of this site's readers have passed over this paragraph upon reading the first sentence.  And I am fairly certain that few have read the findings of the Independence Institute.  But for those who have made it this far, regardless of your politcal opinions and views, I can only hope that in the future you will help to condemn this terrorism from home.

In retrospect, the Beatles' break up after this album is understandable.  Their prolific output and musical development over the previous six years was staggering. Abbey Road showed the world that there was nowhere left to go, this was the summit of what rock music could be. From Please Please Me to Abbey Road is a heck of a leap.  (Consider that most major artists currently are lucky to produce 2-3 albums in six years and that there's typically only a handful of good tunes on any of them).    Perhaps because they knew they were breaking up, the lads gave it their all.  The passion of Paul's singing on \\"Oh Darling\\", John's on \\"I Want You\\", the gorgeous harmonizing on \\"Because\\", the quality of George's contributions (\\"Something\\", Here Comes The Sun\\") easily the equal of John's and Paul's.  Even Ringo's drumming had matured, he sounds like a full fledged Beatle  (although he is credited with the album's only failure \\"OCtopus's Garden\\".  Not as bad musically as many make it but the lyrics are an embarrassment on an album of this exceptionally high calibre).    Other than the aforementioned song, this album is one continuum of excellent songs with great melodies.  It ranges stylistically from folk rock (Here Comes the Sun) to hard rock (I Want You) to melodic pop (Something, Golden Slumbers) to psychedelia (Come Together) to flat out rock and roll (Polythene Pam, The End).  Being able to pull off so many styles on the same album yet make the album feel like a cohesive whole is a testament to the Beatles' genius.  Abbey Road hasn't dated a day since its release and it sounds immensely better than the vast majority of popular music being released now.
6305736650|5.0|I have been told that I am fascinated with a \\"mediocre\\" movie.  I'm talking about Casablanca, the 1942 classic starring Humphrey Bogart (Rick Blaine), Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa Lund), Paul Henreid,(Victor Laszlo), Claude Rains (Captain Louis Renault).     Detractors may say what they will but Casablanca is a classic, a one of a kind gem, a happy collection of talent and circumstance that happens once in a life time.     Casablanca has at least this much in common with Shakespeare: much of the dialog has become a part of the language. Phrases like: \\"...here's lookin' at you, kid\\" and \\"I stick my neck out for nobody\\" have become a part of our heritage while \\"...round up the usual suspects\\" inspired a movie of its own. Likewise, Casablanca'swit would make Oscar Wilde proud. For example: \\"I don't mind a parasite; I object to a cut rate one.\\" Also --Rick tells Renault that he came to Casablanca for the waters. Renault objects that Casablanca is in the desert. \\"I was misinformed\\", Rick replies. The most famous quote of all is one that was never uttered in Casablanca: \\"Play it again, Sam.\\" The actual exchange was:     SAM: Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.    ILSA: (softly) Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake     SAM: I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.    ILSA: Play it, Sam. Play \\"As Time Goes By.\\"     And that brings up the music. It is the music --as much as the improbable cosmopolitan atmosphere, the smart white jackets and bow ties, the Nazi threat --that conjures up our nostalgia for a past we never knew and perhaps never was. As Time Goes By is not the only standard made timeless by its use in Casablanca. Sam is playing and singing \\"It Had to be You\\" as we enter Rick's Cafe Americain for the first time.     Still, critics will tell you Casablanca is a mediocre movie. Mostly notably, Humberto Eco [From: Signs of Life in the U.S.A.: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers, Sonia Maasik and Jack Solomon, eds. (Boston: Bedford Books, 1994) pp.260- 264] wrote: \\". It is a comic strip, a hotch-potch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects.\\"    Now having told us that it is mediocre Eco goes on to tell us why it is great:     \\"It opens in a place already magical in itself -- Morocco, the Exotic --  and begins with a hint of Arab music that fades into La Marseillaise. Then as we enter Rick's Place we hear Gershwin.  Africa, France, America.  At once a tangle of Eternal Archetypes comes into play. These are situations that have presided over stories throughout the ages. But usually to make a good story a single archetypal situation is enough.  More than enough. Unhappy Love, for example, or Flight. But Casablanca is not satisfied with that: It uses them all. The city is the setting for a Passage.... The passage from the waiting room to the Promised Land requires a Magic Key, the visa. ...But eventually we discover that the Key can be obtained only through a Gift -- the gift of the visa, but also the gift Rick makes of his Desire by sacrificing himself For this is also the story of a round of Desires, only two of which are satisfied: that of Victor Laszlo, the purest of heroes, and that of the Bulgarian couple. All those whose passions are impure fail.\\"    Eco's language is familiar to anyone who's read Joseph Campbell. These ideas influenced a generation of film makers --most notably George Lucas and Steven Speilberg. Quite simply, Casablanca speaks to us with the same force and with the same authority as the Arthurian Legends of whom Winston Churchill wrote: \\"If they are not true, they ought to be.\\"    My own reasons for loving Casablanca are simpler but sufficient at least for me: I'm a sucker for \\"As Time Goes By\\"; I wanna take on and defeat the Nazi Reich whenever I hear the La Marseillaise; I can't look at Ingrid Bergman without falling in love.    What more do you want from mere celluloid?    Critics will always be held at bay by films like Casablanca. Pointing up its mediocrity they merely prove its lasting greatness. Someday you'll understand that. Not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But soon and for the rest of your life! Here's looking at you, kid.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I thought this was very good, certainly good for a night's entertainment. I thought both Cruise and Foxx were good, but probably not for a nomination (must be a slow year in movies). Cruise has his \\"Mission:Impossible\\" mode and Foxx changes from a waddling to active state back to waddling, but you always want him to pull through.
0689865384|5.0|This book was WAY better than I expected it to be. In fact it was GREAT!!! I loved the all the chracters, especially Tally, David and Peris! The whole story line is really cool also. I read the whole thing in one day it was so awesome. I can't wait for the second book in the trilogy, Pretties!!!
B00002E224|5.0|Everything about this movie is brilliant.  In the space of 24 hours, the characters make a connection that is so poignant that it is sheer torture when the new day dawns and the two have to go their separate ways.  You kinda wish that time would stand still and real life would butt out.  'Before Sunrise' captures the essence of what it's like when two people serendipitously discover they are each other's soulmates.  Richard Linklater is a god.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is a movie that will be better appreciated in the future than it is today.  Its advanced technology was lost on today's audience, which could not comprehend it. It's a technophiles dream. It's also an ode to almost every action flick Hollywood has ever made. <br /> <br />I could say a lot more, but I want you to actually SEE this movie and decide for yourself,  <br />
0312995423|5.0|I had been steering clear of fiction for a long time. The last fiction I read was Roddy Doyle's \\"Paddy Clar Ha Ha Ha\\" - and this was almost 10 years ago! I heard some faint murmurings of a book called the Da Vinci code on the net and from a few friends. Curious to see what it was about, I picked it up. I think I got hooked to Dan Brown books right then and there! I went on to Angel's & Demons. That was very enjoyable to read. After that I had to read Digital Fortress. It is clearly a book in a different genre from the other two. Being a software writer myself, I found the ideas in the book very intriguing. But cryptology and \\"viruses\\" apart - the book was just fun. Agreed, some of plot is a little far fetched, some things just happen coincidentially (if you know what I mean:)but Dan Brown has this knack of grabbing your attention and not letting go until the very last page. <br />As with his previous books, dialogs and character development don't seem to be Dan Brown's forte (I am only comparing him to great writers like Frederick Forsythe & Jeffrey Archer), but he is a very smart writer. He mixes and stirs fiction, history, science, and different sub-plots in a  giant cauldron, and he does it so adroitly that the result is a potent edge-of-the-seat read! <br /> <br />Over all - a great book - probably not a classic, but still a very enjoyanble read.
0743243315|2.0|For someone who never puts a book down once I have started no matter how little it appeals to me, I did the impossible and gave up reading the rest of Brick Lane when I arrived at 200 pages. The reviews on Monica Ali's book promised so much, but gave so little. A long drawn out book with a few redeeming scenes (when Nazneen's first child was ill in hospital and she and Chanu took turns to keep watch), Brick Lane is tough going. Especially annoying was the gibberish from Nazneen's sister which I assumed was meant to be Bengali expressed in direct transliteration. The characters were neither fascinating nor inspirational nor interesting nor deserving of empathy. Of course if I had plodded on I might have changed my mind, but the point being that it was so un-engaging there was no desire on my part to get to the end of it.
0060594888|5.0|If you could only read one self-help book, make it this one.  Funny, motivational, inspirational. It will make you laugh, make you cry, make you think and make you say to yourself, I can get what I want. If you simply follow the advice, you will get what from where you are to where you want to be. It is over 400 pages, but it is so well written that you simply fly through it the first time.<br /><br />I'm not recommending it to my friends - I'm buying it and giving them a copy.<br /><br />The cost $24.95 (before the Amazon discount).  The value - priceless.
B0000793ZA|5.0|This album sounds as fresh in 2005 as it did when I first bought it in '83.  Amazing stuff
B000092ZYX|5.0|A rabbit walks into a pub, feeling really hungry. He goes up to the bar, and says to the bar-man, \\"Hello mate, do you have anything to eat here? I'm quite hungry.\\" The bar-man replies, \\"Yeah sure we do. We have three types of toastie. Cheese toasties, ham and cheese toasties, and plain ham toasties.\\" \\"Ok\\" says the Rabbit, \\"I'll have a cheese toastie than please.\\" So, the bar-man gives the Rabbit the cheese toastie, and the Rabbit gobbles it all up in one.  <br /> <br />Still feeling hungry, the Rabbit asks for the ham and cheese toastie. The bar-man gives it to him, and again, the Rabbit gobbles it all up in one.  <br /> <br />Still not satisfied, the Rabbit asks for the ham toastie. The bar-man gives him a strange look, but gives him the ham toastie anyway. The Rabbit gobbles it up in one, but suddenly, drops dead at the bar.  <br /> <br />Later, the coroner is asked to give his verdict on the rabbit's mysterious and sudden death......  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br />.  <br /> <br />  \\"Well,\\" said the coroner, \\"He died of mixinghistoasties.\\"
B000000OQF|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever bought, bar none.     Song by song:    Welcome to the Jungle: This really does welcome you into \\"the jungle\\" (LA) and into the world of sex, drugs, rock n' roll and into the heads of the most creative musicians of all time. Welcome to the Jungle is Axl's view of what LA would look to an outsider just coming into the city. Outstanding! 10/10    It's So Easy: I really like how Axl's voice goes really deep here and the begining is really catchy. 8.5/10    Nightrain: One of my favorites on the CD. Slash's guitar solo is amazing at the end. The lyrics are really fabulous: \\"I'm on the nightrain so's I can leave this slum\\" just gets me because it really shows what $h!tty lives they led before becoming rock stars. Something about this album that appeals to me is how they wrote about what life was really like for people trying to make it in LA. 10/10    Out ta get Me: Good rocking song about Axl trying to escape from the police and whoever else he'd pissed off, claiming that he was \\"f*uckin' innocent\\". 8/10    Mr. Brownstone: I heard someone say this song was about a nosy neighbor. It's not. It's a song Slash and Duff wrote about a heroine addiction. The bass in the begining is awsome and brings you right into the song wanting more. 9.5/10    Paradise City: This is a great song to get revved up and energized before working out or something. Some of the guitar work is amazing.   9/10    My Michelle: Another favorite; Michelle's life obviously sucked, but we get a great song out of it. This is lyrically strong, but it's definatly one of the songs that helped \\"Appetite\\" earn the explicit label. This is a very heavy song-- both musically and lyrically. 10/10    Think About You: This is a song that was put in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's good, but between \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" it really gets overlooked. A nice love song, though. 7.5/10    Sweet Child O' Mine: Wow. This is the first GN'R song I ever heard and the one that made me buy the CD. This is, in my opinion, the greatest love song ever written, and also the greatest song ever written. The lyrics are poetic and the music fits perfectly. The guitar riff at the begining will blow your mind. This one cuts you deep. Everyone I know who is even slightly into rock music likes this when I play it for them. One thing that makes it stand out is that it's so emotional and on an album this heavy and among songs like \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" etc. it's different. This shows Axl Rose off to be one of the greatest vocalists of all time (aside from Freddie Mercury). Axl is a poet and Erin Everly is the luckiest woman ever to have this written for her. 10/10    You're Crazy: Probably the weakest song of this compilation. However, if any of today's bands did a song of this calibur it would be amazing. But up against all these classics this one falls a little short. The slow version of this on \\"GNR Lies\\" is much better, partially because it's easyier to understand the lyrics. 7/10    Anything Goes: I actually like this one, even though some people claim the lyrics are stupid. It's not deep and emotionally inspiring like some of these songs, but it's fun, it's rocking, and it's great to sing along to. 8/10    Rocket Queen: Amazing. Probly the best after \\"Sweet Child\\". It's also poetic at the end and good, hard rock in the beginging. This one need to be heard a few times for it to grab you. This first couple runs through the sex sounds are sort of offputting. This song really benefits if you listen to the words and not just the music. It's good for when your sad or feeling hopeless. 10/10
B00009V7RF|4.0|For those out there who have problems with \\"Let's Get Retarded.\\" The song has nothing to do with disabled people. It's saying to enjoy music, dance like you don't care who's watching, and just have fun. It may not be the most PC way to put it, but they are in no way making fun of the disabled. Fine, it's a comment that can be interpreted as saying that dancing like a fool is similar to being retarded, but it's just about letting loose and having fun. Generally speaking, the actions of severely mentally disabled people are considered unusual to most people. Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is. They're saying to act in such a way when having fun, and not caring what other people think. And that's reading a lot into it. And the music is good. It's true that it's not exactly hip hop. It's more like like a funk cd, but if you're judging them based on their older stuff, then you need to get your head out of your ass and review what's here, not what you wanted or expected. It's fun, well put together music. Where is the Love? and the APL Song are really good, with great messages. And if you think Where is the Love? is corny or insincere, then maybe you're just a little too cynical. The lyrics make good points about what's goin' on in the world. Anxiety is great, and in no way invalidates Where is the Love? No matter how much you love others, there are times when you will go through so much anxiety that you feel like you're going insane, and one result of this can be the urge to \\"smack somebody.\\" Screw being PC, it's just the truth. They didn't say to smack somebody, just that the anxiety gives them the urge to. Fine, most of it is party music, but at least it's good party music, and they certainly have a decent number of serious songs with insight. So stop bitching about supposed insensitivities and not having your expectations met, listen to the damn music, and then decide.
B00009V7T2|5.0|this is one of the the definitive albums in my collection... it belongs amongst the top albums of all time, and, in my humble opion, amongst the top ten... not one misplaced note, not one poorly composed song throughout... more than an incredible tribute to a friend passed on, 'de-loused' is a testament to the world that the spirit of rock has come back from the ashes and is singing rich dirges for us all... to miss hearing this in it's entirety is a crime against your very soul.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban can't seem to take a falty step, can he?  I was introduced to Josh Groban by a friend of mine (yes, it was a girl!) during the PBS concert.  I was a little shocked.  Here was a guy my age that was singing with full orchestras.  Not normal.  Yet, he was also very good at it.  I listened to his first CD, sought out some b-sides, and so on and came to really enjoy his talent.  Then Closer came out.  I really didn't think he could surpass himself, but surpass himself he did.  Closer was a step up.  On first listen we find that his music accompaniment is tighter and a little more diverse.  We also get a French song.  Many other things get upgraded but the thing that remains the same is Josh's overpowering ability to capture the mood of each song, adding just the right dynamics to each mood, whether he be singing in English, Spanish, Italian, or French.  Also, pending further listens, you seem to start to understand the messages being conveyed in said foreign songs.  Not necessarily the words, but the over-all message.  Amazing.  Regardless of what music you listen to, Josh Groban should be added to your collection because he is music.  Dynamics, variations, ballads, moods, etc...  A close study only helps you appreciate the music you love more, whatever music it may be (heck, I listen to punk!).
B000002KGT|5.0|I had the vinyl, bought the CD, never thought it could get better. I was wrong. Audiophile that I am, I can't get into anything that moves sound quality in the wrong direction, such as MP3. But enter high resolution audio formats, such as DVD-Audio and SACD, and I'm in hog heaven. We won't debate the merits and shortcomings in these formats; that's not what this is about. I will say that the DVD-Audio treatment, with Ken Caillat's expert mixing, has taken a masterpiece and made it better.    Hearing the guitar riff in \\"Never Going Back Again\\" that had been eliminated in the stereo version was a revelation. And the inclusion of \\"Silver Springs\\", recorded during the \\"Rumours\\" sessions, but not included in the original release due to time restrictions, was most welcome. This has been a favorite of mine since first hearing it on a box set. Word is that Stevie, upon hearing the final playback of the surround mix, was moved to tears. The textures of the music just come through more clearly in surround. The stereo track included on the disc is the same as the CD, only with more clarity and detail. The Dolby Digital 5.1 track, included for those listening on DVD-V players, is the same mix as the DVD-A, but with more constricted sound. It still sounds great, but there's no comparison with the DVD-A track. There is an inherent compatibility problem with certain DVD players, such as the Toshiba SD2109 and 3109, and I also experienced this. But every other player I tried had no problem with this disc. I currently use a Pioneer player with both DVD-A and SACD, and I recommend a player for both formats. But this disc is phenomenal, and I suggest adding it to your DVD-A collection today, if not sooner!
B000089RVX|5.0|First of all, when I bought this CD, the only song I liked was Bring Me To Life... I bought the CD based on that one song, later I got to hear the rest of the songs and I have to admit that I loved them all instantly, the band became my favorite artist EVER!! I just can't get enoughf of it, I bought the CD almost two years ago and it's still my favorite, every single song has a message and it's transmitted beautifully, they have a gothic sound and the vocalist, Amy Lee, has the most perfect voice for a ballad, the combination is heaven for your ears: <br /> <br />1- Going Under 5/5: One of the best songs in this CD, it's deep and powerful, they transport you into their world of music. <br /> <br />2- Bring Me To Life 5/5: Like I told you, it's the reason I bought this CD and I certainly don't regret it, it's still my favorite song, wonderful. <br /> <br />3- Everybody's Fool 5/5: Also an excellent song, one of the best lyrics of the CD, it just captivates you. <br /> <br />4- My Inmortal 5/5: The most beautiful song in this CD, fantastic lyrics, perfect for Amy's voice to give you chills all the way to the end of the song, she also plays the piano wonderfully. <br /> <br />5- Haunted 5/5: The exact reflection of the group, it's a dark song and it gets to your soul. <br /> <br />6- Tourniquet 5/5: The darkest song, it has cool and powerful music, Amy's voice sounds great in the song and it has my favorite lyrics in the CD. <br /> <br />7- Imaginary 5/5: It's a very interesting song, cool lyrics and the music is deep, Amy's voice is great and sends her feelings through it. <br /> <br />8- Taking Over Me 5/5: Beautiful lyrics, Amy sounds great and the music is fantastic, one of my favorite songs in the CD <br /> <br />9- Hello 5/5: Amy's vocal range is extremely powerful and beautiful in this song, it's magnificent, the song is very special for Amy because it's about the death of her sister when she was a kid, and she puts her soul on this song, it sends me chills allover. <br /> <br />10- My Last Breath 5/5: Cool mix of music, Amy's voice is beautiful as always and the lyrics are deep. <br /> <br />11- Whisper 5/5: Last but not least, \\"Whisper\\" gives us another wonderful and deep lyrics magnificently sung by Amy, it finalizes with a cool dark cover by music and a great chorus creating the perfect ending for this fantastic CD. <br /> <br />So, in conclusion, it's the BEST CD of 2003, hehe. <br /> <br />Thanks for taking the time to read this!
B00069YDXU|1.0|I'll give this a token one star because Carl Palmer can still play like hell and Greg Lake plays the most beautiful bass guitar I've ever seen (not heard, mind you, seen.) Otherwise this disc is literally going in my trashcan. I can only assume that my fellow reviewers who've looked upon this DVD kindly are so young that they never saw ELP in their prime, when they were an amazing band and their concerts a thrilling, spine tingling experience. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THREE MUSICIANS WHO HATE PLAYING TOGETHER SO OBVIOUSLY as I do on this DVD. The bad vibe between Emerson and Lake is palpable, they won't even look at each other. Emerson's chops are all but gone, he's content to substitute speed for accuracy, he's all over the place, sloppy BEYOND belief, the Alvin Lee of keyboards. Greg Lake plays some nice acoustic guitar but plays bass like he hasn't picked it up for a decade and isn't all that sure where the right notes are. His voice is....well, it's gone. He sounds like me doing a really, really good imitation of Greg Lake in the shower, with the flu. Technically, as others have noted, the sound is dreadful, as is the stage lighting which never surpasses that which you saw at your high school prom. On the positive side, even at half effort, playing with two guys who clearly don't give a damn, Carl Palmer shows why he was one of the greatest drummers of his era, if not the greatest. If you're a young fan, please know that ELP were honestly one of the most important, groundbreaking, genuinely awe-inspiring bands of the 70's... though you'd never know it from this travesty of a performance. If you're an ELP fans who remembers their greatness, avoid this at all costs. It's a quick cash desecration of their past brilliance, a trashing of their own art and their own heritage. It's just too sad.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne is so trashy, so sleazy.  It looks like she doesn't bathe.  She's so oily and greasy that she'd probably slide right through your hands if you tried to pick her up.  Unbelievable filth completely covers every bit of her, and if she ever does decide to take a bath, she'll lose about 5 pounds!  Why do you people like her?  Why does everybody call her \\"talented\\"?  Since when does bathing only once a decade make you \\"talented\\"?  I think I know when the last time Avril bathed must have been.  I bet it was 1993.  There was a huge oil spill in that year.  Everybody thinks the oil was spilled from a ship, but I wouldn't be suprised at all if it was just Avril Lavigne taking her once a decade bath! <br /> <br />Avril Lavigne is the slipperiest, oiliest, greasiest dirtball I've ever seen.  She's made it cool to be dirty.  That's so disgusting.
0385486804|1.0|..so I have no right to rate the book. It's probably very well written, since Krakauer's article was.  I guess the one-star rating above is for the subject, Chris McCandless. I'm afraid I side with the native Alaskans on their evaluation of him - another \\"nut case\\" trying to prove something. So maybe he wasn't a psychopath, but I'd bet money he was bi-polar. He showed the signs - high intelligence, idealism, self-involvement, and alternating gregariousness and anti-social tendencies. Plus absolutely no common sense. These people can be the life of the party, very successful and charming beyond belief, and then turn around and get angry, moody, contemptuous, and may lapse into a depression so deep you think they'll die in their sleep. They're completely unpredictable. He was heartbroken at killing an animal for food, but ignored his family's understandable desire to have HIM remain alive. I don't fault Krakauer for admiring him - I think Krakauer is just naive as to what made the guy tick. He wasn't \\"better\\" than anyone else; he just thought he was. If he had been life-smart as well as book-smart, he'd still be alive today. And his poor family wouldn't be grieving. This book (OK, the article) almost glorifies McCandless's naive foolishness. If he'd tramped into the forest after intensive wildnerness training, much reading & research about Denali, and fully prepared with map, compass, waterproof clothing and all, I would have called it an adventure. As it was, it was no more admirable than lip-piercing and slam-dancing. \\"Nyah! I don't like this society! I'm dropping out!\\"  I'm afraid I have no sympathy for McCandless. I'd rather read a book about a more productive character. Someone who rescued slaves, maybe, or worked with battered children. Or who discovered fossils somewhere. Even the adventures of Jon Krakauer are more interesting - an author who slogs along through life, confronting demons here and there, but manages to publish best-selling books and make a pretty healthy living. I like reading about someone who really made a positive difference. Not a precocious child of 24, like McCandless.
B0000931OG|1.0|I'm really thankful i bought this album in a second hand store for 3 euros as it is worth a lot less.    no comment.    it's just a shame to think this band recorded Blur and Parklife or even Modern Life once.      this can't be happening...    call it a day guys.please
B000000OA6|4.0|Fred Mercury's voice seemed to have gotten better and better with time.  He undoubtedly has one of the best voices in Rock N'Roll.  While the album doesn't draw as strong reviews as classics like \\"A night at the Opera\\" and \\"News of the World\\", this album is miles ahead of its predecessor \\"The Miracle\\".  Innuendo starts with its title track, a tune with great percussion and minor-scale tones, has some deep lyrics are about the endless madness that is evident throughout man's history; but how the human spirit will just hang in there and keep on trying in spite of it all.  The song turns into a fantastic fusion of Flamenco and Hard rock at the end (Following a similar structure with Bohemian Rhapsody).  It's an incredible piece.  The album has good rockers like \\"Headlong\\" and others, but the main feature of this album is the lyrics and Freddy's unique voice such as in \\"I'm going slightly mad\\" and the final note \\"The show must go on\\", where the same theme from Innuendo resonates -  The glorious triumph of the spirit over the inevitable circumstances of the material world.  He delivers this in a non-religious way, yet increbigly spirit-empowering, just like \\"We are the champions\\".   Any true Queen fan just have to have this album.
0767834739|3.0|Resident Evil: Apocalypse (Alexander Witt, 2004)<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse may be Alexander Witt's first directorial credit, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have more than enough experience under his belt to direct an action flick. His previous credits include work on such things-blow-up-nicely movies as Pirates of the Caribbean, XXX, Gladiator, and Lethal Weapon 3. So you can go into Apocalypse knowing you're going to get, at least, a solid action flick.<br /><br />Then you take a look at the cast. Milla Jovovich returns, of course, but much of the rest of the cast are also known for solid action-film work; there's Oded Fehr (The Mummy), Jared Harris (b.Monkey), Sienna Guillory (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Razaaq Adoti (Black Hawk Down), and Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason), among others. Getting away from action films, Sandrine Holt (Black Robe) and Mike Epps (Strays) also jump out of the cast. So you know you have a well-acted solid action flick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's all you get. It's really kind of depressing that one of the few games actually capable of scaring you if played in the right conditions doesn't actually merit a horror film, but there you go. Jovovich reprises her role from the first film, and is here backed up by game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Fehr). The basic plot of the movie is that the three of them, along with a changing roster of hangers-on, have to both survive the city's undead and get out of the now-quarantined Raccoon City for reasons that the viewer's clued into about halfway through the movie. The result, as noted in the rating, is non-stop violence.<br /><br />Given that, it's surprising how well the film does work on that level. The situation is quite likely to remind you of Predator, arguably the best film Schwarzenegger ever made (and definitely the best film Gov. Ventura ever made); Apocalypse suffers in comparison because the characters don't have anywhere near as much depth, but the action sequences never fail to be just as much fun. I just wish it had more of the outright creepy feel that made Resident Evil 2 (the game) so wonderful. ** ½t the action sequences never fail to be just as much fun.

B000003C5C|5.0|I now have all of Death's albums going all the way back to the band's legendary debut Scream Bloody Gore to their last great album Sound Of Perseverance. Their second album Leprosy is now my all time favorite Death album. Not only it's my favorite, in my opinion, this is arguably their all time best album. I listen to this one a lot because of it's raw heavy sound and the awesome blend of thrash and death metal. Gut-wrenching guitar riffs, dive bombing leads, killer drumming, man this album is an absolute death metal masterpiece that every death metal fan should own. Chuck Schuldiner's vocals are just stunning, and his leadwork is just cool, even second guitarist Rick Rozz is not too bad himself. Terry Butler is probably one of the best bassists in death metal, and his bass is really awesome on here, it's just earthshaking. And of course drummer Bill Andrews shows his hard pounding skills behing the kit. My favorite songs on here are Leprosy, Pull The Plug, Open Casket, Born Dead, and Choke On It. R.I.P Chuck, you were a great guy and I wish I could've met you. Death Rules!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|You will need to open the door to this music and it's going to take your true heart and soul to get in.This album is going to set new boundaries in the recording industry. <br />Pat and Lyle have created musical milestones in the past,but this compositional work goes beyond anything they have ever done or rather beyond anything being created by todays musicians currently in this era or generation. <br />Being an accomplished and advanced artist myself for years.I have never witnessed performers playing in a group effort at this high level,with music performed with such emotion,innovation,and detail. <br />PMG is \\"The Way Up\\"  always and forever.
B0000047CW|5.0|This fabulous record shows off the great artistry of a master musician on saxophone. Getz seems to have such a natural feel to this type of music. The guitar of Charlie Byrd is also superb and blends into the music in a wonderful manner. The other amazing aspect of this record is that I never tire of listening to it.
B00003CXIP|5.0|What a movie!!  I was home on leave from the Army and rented this from a Blockbuster store and fell in love with it  This is a great one and another classic book to film adaptation from the work of Stephen King  Great job by Rob \\"Meathead\\" Reiner on his direction of this movie  The adventure that every kid dreams of is featured in this film when four teenage boys follow the railroad tracks to find a dead body of a boy hit by a train  The interaction and genuine friendship between the boys is obvious on screen and the young actors are very charismatic and talented especially the late River Phoenix who died tragically in the early '90s at a nightclub in L.A of a drug overdose  What a huge success he would have been if he lived  One thing that I do fing kind of curious on this movie is the homosexual undertones that exist between Phoenix's character and Will Wheaton's character  If you look closely you can tell it is there  That is the only downside of the movie  Otherwise nothing short of a classic
B0000046ZJ|4.0|A very cool record with a great selection of songs. Shame about the sound quality which is acceptable but could be better even though it is not in stereo. Four and half stars.
0142000655|4.0|This wonderful book by Steinbeck gives a panoramic history of the Salinas Valley which the author uses as a microcosm of America as a whole.  The story outlines the lives of two families in the valley.  They are The Trask and Hamilton families.  This book would probably fit in the genre of historical romance, but it's much more than that.  Steinbeck delves into the differences between good and evil.  The plot and storyline are much more sweeping than some of Steinbeck's other books.  The timeline of the book is from the American Civil War to World War I, and it covers the entire United States.  Steinbeck does a pretty good job with his characterizations.  His best character in the book is Cathy Ames (Adam Trask's wife).  She appears so innocent to people that she encounters, but this façade hides true evil.  The book is fairly long, but quite readable.
B0000047CX|5.0|One of the all time great records! The sound that comes out of Stan's saxophone is simply superb - it is so warm, gorgeous and lyrical. The quality of music is just flawless. A joy!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|If there is one reason to see Sky Captain, it's for the film's amazing visual effects and set designs. It is exactly what eye candy should be; entertaining, beautiful, and often funny. Sky Captain is like a fantasy version of Indiana Jones, and one that is particularly successful. <br /> <br />Jude Law stars as the title's Captain, who is now faced with his biggest battle to date. Large robots have invaded the city, destroying everything, unearthing the city's generators. He has to try to put a stop to their plan - and figure out where these flying robots are from - before it's too late. <br /> <br />Joining his quest are Polly (Paltrow), a nosy reporter and an old flame of Law's, a scientist pal friend of Law played by Ribbisi and a multitude of funny and original characters. This is one movie that was perfectly cast. Law is perfect as the fearless and smirky Sky Captain, and Paltrow is perfect as the snobbish reporter who will do everything in her power to get what she wants. <br /> <br />But see the movie for it's visuals. The whole thing is just like a dream. Having been filmed entirely in front of a blue screen, Sky Captain offers amazing visuals that you won't soon forget. And yes, the effects are well done. The film's washed up Roccocco style is just breathtaking. There is never a dull moment in Sky Captain.  <br /> <br />I had a great time watching this one. The movie is funny, greatly entertaining and exciting. My only concern is that we'll never see another Sky Captain adventure since the film's box office take was so small. That would be a shame indeed.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Don't get me wrong, Eric Clapton is a master at playing blues within his rock n roll stylings.  The interpretations of Robert Johnson's pieces are quite reasonable. Billy Preston's keyboards stand out very prominently as his solos and embelleshments are truly Grade A. Songwise, my preffered tracks are They're Red Hot, When You Got Good Friends, Come Into My Kitchen, and Stop Breakin' Down Blues.<br /><br />However when comparing this tribute recording to similar work as From The Cradle and Riding With The King, Me and Mr Johnson clearly finishes in third place. On Me and Mr. Johnson most of the arrangements are fairly identical with limited varitions in the song pacings.  Yes, there are a couple of slow tunes and a few go very fast.  But the drumming does not change very much throughout the fourteen track recording.<br /><br />Also to note, somehow the overall feel of the blues is lacking here.  Eric performs many of these songs in an blues-lite manner with limited hard ripping passion either from his voice or guitar.  Don't get me wrong some of the mellow Clapton tones are fine.  However, the sound wears thin when the tone does not vary two thirds of the way through the recording.  Just listen to From The Cradle.  Eric tears up the guitar and growls with a passion on Someday After A While, Groaning The Blues, and Five Long Years.  Nothing on Me and Mr. Johnson approaches these efforts.<br /><br />Therefore, the rating on Me and Mr. Johnson rates as a good 3-3 1/2 star level instead of a 4-5 star level that From The Cradle and Riding With The King stand.
B00030590I|5.0|Hero might very well be one of the best martial arts flick you'll ever see. Mixing history with great action sequences, solid performances with striking visuals, it is a beautiful film that never ceases to amaze its viewers. <br /> <br />Told Roshomon-style, the same story is retold during the course of the film from four different point of views. Our Hero (Jet Li) is telling the emperor of China how he was able to defeat the four great assassin's that threatened the emperor's life. But as the story moves along, we soon realize that what we see and hear might not be what truly happened, and that Li might also have a hidden agenda. <br /> <br />The film is just amazing to look at. The colors are rich and breathtaking. The action sequences are filmed beautifully (American filmmakers take note : a great action sequence is one where you actually see what happens, not one where the editing is so fast and choppy that you can't register anything!). The performances are solid (especially from Ziyi Zhang and Li) and the story very touching.  <br /> <br />This is a martial arts flick with a heart and soul. Based on historical events, Hero will surprise you at every turn. This one has taken a place in my all-time top 10 fave action flicks. Don't miss out on it.
B00003CXDD|5.0|People is blinded as most part of them r. This movie is taken advantage of Tolkien's world, and so be it. As for myself, this movie is a better \\"Tolkien\\" story then the ridiculusly long/boring LOTR series. First of all, the what some might call \\"little people\\" look definitely more convincing than Wood and the others, the bg music r stronger piece in terms of speaking Tolkien's world. Yes, there r some weak parts in between, but I liek this whole quest of Willow Ofgood, its more charming and the pace is faster, not to mention the directing is way better. I dun read Tolkien's books because its long and boring but becuase its fun. And this movie absolutely have done a better job. The music works, that's all I wanted to point out.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Horror and comedy don't always mesh well together. Only a few movies have been able to marry both of them successfully with one antoehr (like Raimi's Evil Dead series for instance). Well, our generation finally has its great horror comedy. And it's called Shaun of The Dead. <br /> <br />Shaun is a boring guy who's boring life has lost all of its charms. Now, on the night he breaks up with his girlfriend, he'll be faced with the greatest battle of his life. London is infested with zombies and it will be up to him to save his mother and his ex-girlfriend from this terrible tragedy. <br /> <br />This one is a laugh-a-minute marathon that ends up being pretty scary in its last half hour. As Shaun makes it across London to get from one place to the other, the movie also juxtaposes the fact that we, in real life, have also become zombies. At one point, Shaun is looking at some of the people sitting on a bus with him, and they look exactly like what the zombies are about to look like. <br /> <br />The movie is perfectly cast and the plot brightly written. The balance between horror and comedy is realized in a way that is worthy of all the praise it can get. Neither horror or comedy dominates here.  <br /> <br />I'm so happy that this British flick was able to achieve the things it did. Let it be a lesson to filmmakers in North America; remakes aren't original. Flicks like Shaun of the Dead are. This is one horror comedy that will survive the test of time!
B000088E6D|5.0|This is one of the best CDS I have heard.  It is a perfect record for those that like jazz but aren't into just instrumentation.  Michael Buble' is an extraordinary talent!  If you think you MIGHT like this, then you won't go worn by ordering it right away!!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|What a fun movie!  Everyone talked about the graphics, and they were right--amazing!  Every scene was rich and lavious w/beautiful graphics, and a handsome Jude Law (Sky Captain).  I had seen him in a couple of films before (The Talented Mr. Ripley), but never really saw how good-looking he is...until now!  Hottie!  Gwyneth Paltrow (Polly) plays herself more-or-less:  annoying.  I kept wishing Polly would shut up and go with the flow.  Angelina Jolie (Franky) was over-hyped.  For her small part she did not deserve third billing.  She was wonderful in the role though.  I found myself cheering when she was kicking butt.<br /><br />I plan to make this part of my collection, although the $20 price tag is a little high.  Regardless of that, see this movie.  It's worth it for the special effects...and Jude Law especially!
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Paul Simon has released many albums full of hit making music in his very productive and long career. Many know him as one-half of the successful folk duo \\"Simon and Garfunkel\\" Others know him for his early 70's solo hits like \\"Kodachrome\\" and \\"Me and Julio Down By the School Yard\\". However, Simon didn't come out with his arguably strongest and most artistic album till the 1980's, when he released \\"Graceland\\". The album has Simon tapping into new sources for music inspriation, and coming out with some of the most complex material he has released in years. <br /> <br />Where in the 60's and 70's Simon was more of a folk singer/songwritter, the 80's meant adjustment. The rock/pop singer/songwritter was what was popular (Billy Joel, Elton John, Tracy Chapman), and Simon adjusted to this change with flying colors. However, he tingled pop senseabilites with world music. This meant complexity in instrumentation with African beats sound and huge pop hooks. The results are unique and sound different than anything Simon had ever done before. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, the music on the CD is pretty good as well. Though the CD doesn't have any Top 20 hits, the album itself was played numerous times on Top 40 radio back in the 80's. Songs like the title track, \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\", \\"Diamonds on the Soles of her shoes\\", and \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" (which was his biggest hit on the album, reaching 24) will be recognizable among Simon fans, as well as 80's music buffs. Simon provides a great mix of introspective thinking with a wide mind and a sense humor. Also many songs reflect on the (then) recent divorce of him and his wife, actress Carrie Fisher, so the songs have a personal feel to them as well. <br /> <br />Though it might not have been a pop radio favorite, it is by far one of the most well produced and deepest albums from the 80's. It won album of the year, and there is reason behind that. Pick up the CD and check out why for yourself.
B00064MW6A|3.0|When I rented this, I made sure to use it on a free rental.  This movie had been panned so much I didn't want to spend ANYTHING.  It wasn't that bad, to my surprise.  My favorite scenes were the ones w/the cats.  Sharon Stone was wonderful as the villian; kudos to her after her stroke.  Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt were also fine, and the chemistry between them kept me interested.  The main problem I had was her costume.  Could she be wearing any less?  And running in heels?  Forget it!  I do recommend this as a fun, not-to-take-serious movie night.  Make some popcorn, grab your cat, and enjoy!
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\" is not perfect, but fuss is something that it definitely could gain. The songs have the perfect mix of punk and new wave, a movement in desparate need of return. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is the popular single from the album, and it's punk/new wave influence is pretty clear just in the lyrics (\\"Somebody Told Me, You had a girlfriend, it looked like a boyfriend\\"), a lot like the Clash.  The other songs are in the same mold and cut. If there was just a little bit more variety, or a few more strong cuts, this would have gotten five stars. Still, not a bad debut, and a four star album that is worth the price of admission to check out.
B0002X314C|5.0|Very sweet album, Kanye obviously gets a lot of inspiration from Legend. Its quite a consistent album, with the exception of &quot;Alright&quot; which I find kind of dull, but other than that, very uplifting and captivating, definitely go check it out.<br />My fav 5 tracks include:<br />1. Number one<BR>2. Refuge (cold outside)<BR>3. Let's get lifted<BR>4. I don't have to change<BR>5. Stay with you
B0001MDP3G|5.0|It would be easy to dismiss COLD MOUNTAIN as nothing more than an upper scale \\"chick flick,\\" a love story chonicling what two disparate lovers go through to reunite during the time of the bloody Civil War.  But Anthony Minghella's movie is so beautifully filmed, scored and acted, that it's love story forms the backdrop for what the Civil War did to this country:  it tore it apart; it ravaged the people and the land; it put neighbor against neighbor, and truly established this war as a dark spot in our history.  If the movie's main flaw is the fact that the two lovers barely knew each other and shouldn't have been so obsessed with their reunion, it is eclipsed by the supporting scenarios, that involve Ada's maturity as a result of her relationship with the rascally Ruby; Ruby's reluctant reconciliation with her deserter father; the cruelty of the ragtag band of law enforcers who take it upon themselves to act as executioners for deserters; the pain of a young widow who asks Inman to lay beside her on her bed so she doesn't feel lonely.  These set pieces more than compensate for the weakness of the main character's love.  However, once the lovers are reunited, the performances are so touching we can believe they have at last fallen in love.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent:  Jude Law (an actor I feel is overrated) gives one of his best performances as the laconic, driven Inman; Nicole Kidman is superb as Ada, showing a quiet self-consciousness and eventually a fierce strength and reserve; Renee Zellweger delivers her Oscar winning performance with a casual brilliance---this is one of her finest moments, too; Donald Sutherland, one of our most overlooked actors, is very convincing in his brief role as Ada's minister father; Brendan Gleeson (another William H. Macy) delivers his usual solid performance as Ruby's errant father; Jack White in his small role as Georgia is impressive; Kathy Baker (Picket Fences; Edward Scissorhands) delivers a quietly powerful performance as Sally, who watches her husband and sons brutally murdered by the self-imposed judge and executioners; Lucas Black (who I just watched last night in the excellent FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) is remarkable in his brief role as Oakley, a teenage soldier mortally wounded in Petersburg; Ray Winstone viably diabolic as the brutal Teak; Eileen Atkins as Mandy, the haglike lady who takes a wounded Inman in; and Natalie Portman in her role as Sarah, the widow who touches Inman's life so poignantly.<br /><br />With a remarkable musical score by Gabriel Yared (City of Angels) and the lovely tunes by Allison Krauss and Sting, COLD MOUNTAIN is a richly realized movie, a testament to love and endurance, and a warning about the hopelessness of war.performance as Sally, who watches her husband and sons brutally murdered by the self-imposed judge and executioners; Lucas Black (who I just watched last night in the excellent FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) is remarkable in his brief role as Oakley, a teenage soldier mortally wounded in Petersburg; Ray Winstone viably diabolic as the brutal Teak; Eileen Atkins as Mandy, the haglike lady who takes a wounded Inman in; and Natalie Portman in her role as Sarah, the widow who touches Inman's life so poignantly. <br />With a remarkable musical score by Gabriel Yared (City of Angels) and the lovely tunes by Allison Krauss and Sting, COLD MOUNTAIN is a richly realized movie, a testament to love and endurance, and a warning about the hopelessness of war.
B000063UR2|4.0|My family has always had a copy of the movie Legend, but it was a TV copy. As a result I think there were parts missing from editing out the commercials but it worked and proud to say, worn out. So when it came to my own home collection I wanted the best. We bought his version expecting it to have everything, it does have quite a bit (haven't watched it all yet).<br /><br />We picked it up to show a future family member who has never seen it, and decided to watch the Directors version hoping it would have more, and more is usually better. Not so in this case. Parts I remember were gone and the alternate music gives the film an entirely different feel. Plus Princess Lily is given an \\"I do what I want\\" attitude, and the film ends completely different.<br /><br />The future family member hated it, and we were disappointed. We quickly popped in the original version and re-watched the ending and the future family member was like, \\"now that is better, why change the ending in the director's version?\\" I agree, and I am in search of the original theatrical version ending song for their wedding.<br /><br />I am thankful that it came with the original version. Tried and true original is best.
B00005AQE8|5.0|eASTnugga or whateva, keep your mouth shut. This isnt a forum about biased opinions. BTW you are greatly outnumbered. Tupac Amaru Shakur will live FOREVER in OUR HEARTS, HIP HOP AND ALL THE LIVES HE INFLUENCED. This is one of the if not the best of all his albums. He is the John Lennon to Hip Hop. We miss you 2PaC...RIP you deserve it. But this album it really will show the an insight into the man that was Tupac. Listen to each song slow and carefully and you will see the intense auora that surrounds each one of his songs. He music was never about the beats nor the rhythms. It was about a message of hope and Us young black males could stand up from a society that oppressed and show we can make our dreams come true. All these so called rappers now and nothing but pawns to a corporate money machine, and they actually push back the movement for us that our people fought so hard for in the 60's. Long live freedom, equality, AMerica and Rest IN PEace Pac....We loSt one of the greatest when we lost you....But this album ...Its worth every cent.
B000000H3Z|5.0|I would have said this album is the best metal album of the 1980's, but then I remember \\"Master of Puppets\\" came out in 1986. So, this album will just have to settle with being the best death metal album of the '80's, and maybe the best death metal album ever.<br /><br />Yes, I prefer \\"Beneath the Remains\\" to Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\". Don't get me wrong, I think \\"RiB\\" is great, and was more influential to the metal scene, but these songs are longer and heavier. Something about \\"Beneath the Remains\\" just grabs me and doesn't let go; it holds my attention better than most death metal. These riffs may not be as fast as \\"Reign in Blood\\", but they are catchier and sound more like real music. The guitars play a mile-a-minute, but the way these songs are played gives the listener time to absorb and enjoy the first riff, before another one comes.<br /><br />Plus, this entire album is full of bone-crunching, inspired and all around great riffs and leads, but Sepultura don't exhaust their song formula or structure, something I thought they did do on their next album, \\"Arise.\\"<br /><br />The drums are audible (which means Igor really has to beat those drums), very fast, and give the beat that \\"boom-boom\\" sound. The drums, although important, aren't overpowering, so they give way to the real good stuff: the guitars.<br /><br />Next, the solos, while not metal's all time best, are just as blistering as any of Slayers. The one area where Slayer is better than Sepultura is speed/beat changes. Most of the songs on \\"Beneath the Remains\\" have two or three speed/beat changes, but they're much more subtle than Slayer's, and they only last a couple of seconds (then it goes back to the first speed.)<br /><br />Musically, \\"Beneath the Remains\\" is like `80's Slayer meets Morbid Angel. But vocally, Max Cavalera differs from Slayer's singer Tom Araya. Max, unlike Araya, doesn't struggle to keep up with the music and he isn't just yelling as fast as possible. Araya usually shrieks so fast and loud that I can hardly ever understand what he's saying. That isn't the case, here. Max goes at his own pace. Plus, his voice is more of a death metal voice: yelling, barking and growling.<br /><br />Finally, the lyrics. When Max wrote these lyrics, he wasn't trying overly hard to be tough or evil, so these lyrics don't come across as cheesy or contrived. Instead, they come across as personal and at times almost political.<br /><br />Now, it's hard to give most death metal albums a track-by-track review, as all of these songs are equally as good as the one before it (all killer, no filler), but if you're a newcomer to Sepultura and looking for standout tracks, I'd recommend \\"Beneath the Remains\\" (which has an acoustic intro, then changes gears and rockets into hyper-speed), \\"Inner Self\\", \\"Sarcastic Existence\\" (which has a drum intro, a pounding double bass, and two scorching solos), and the two ending songs.<br /><br />Some of metal's all time best albums have an instrumental (i.e. Metallica's \\"Orion\\" and \\"Call of the Ktulu\\", Testament's \\"Musical Death\\", Iron Maiden's \\"Losfer Words\\" and Megadeth's \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\"). \\"Beneath the Remains\\" doesn't have an instrumental--it has two! The instrumentals (the aforementioned last two songs on the album) are brilliant and bring the album full circle. These songs are only available on the remaster edition of this album (they do not appear on the original which came out in 1989.)<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great album. Metal may not appeal to the whole population, so death metal appeals to an even smaller percent. But the bottom line is, if you're a metalhead and/or love bands like Slayer, you need to own this C.D.! Finally, if you're new to the band, this is Sepultura's finest hour, and a good place to start.rstand what he's saying. That isn't the case, here. Max goes at his own pace.

B0006399FS|4.0|I would actually rate this a 4.5 if I could.  It's not perfect, but it's a great listen.  I, like a lot of people, am a 20 + year listener of U2.  I have listened through all of their previous phases, and now into (my opinion) the second album of their fourth phase.  Although this current phase is less experimental than the past phase was (AB through Pop) I don't consider it a return to their roots either.  Yes U2 has a trade mark sound and they always will have.  I think people are placing a lot more emphasis than necessary on how this compares to their past work.  This is another example of U2's presence of mind to keep trying new sounds an expressions. <br /> <br />I, like a lot of others, found my initiation to this album slow.  It did take a few listens to really grasp the form of the songs, their meanings and the way they flow together as an album.  With about three or four listens the stronger tracks did stand out (Miracle Drug, STYCMIOYO, City Of Blinding Lights), and eventually all the tracks save one have become regular listens on my MP3 player.  The only track that I struggle with is the overly religous Yeweah.  Not that I'm against anyone's expression of their faith (I am used to it with U2), I just find this one a little over the top and a bit much for me. <br /> <br />My advice if you're on the fence about purchasing this album, borrow it off someone you know and really give it a few good listens before making your decision.  Listen with an open mind and try not to cloud your experience by resorting to comparison of previous U2 glory. The reason I say this is alot of people have compared this to their last album (ATYCLB) for better or worse.  although I agree the style is very similar I believe this to be a far superior effort in terms of overall quality. I also originally was put off by all the hype and the cheesy promotion the album POP and never gave a fair shake.  After my dissapointment with ATYCLB set in I took the opportunity to dust off the copy of POP that I owned and lstened more openly.  It is now one of my favourite albums.

158799190X|1.0|The principal subject could have been adequately covered in a dozen pages or less.  The rest of the book is just a lot of rambling.  Numerous put downs of famous people that only reflected the author's lack of maturity.  Also many pages of trying to convince you of his brilliance.  You time and money can be better spent elsewhere.
0670033375|5.0|Jared's \\"collapse\\" exams the causes of failure for ancient and modern societies, such as the American Anasazis and contemporary African nations. Jared hypothesizes that societies collapse due to both eco disasters, and an apparent disregard for the cause or resolution of these eco-disasters. This book is not strictly an environmentalist's look at society and its interaction with nature; rather, Jared strives to illustrate the erosion of our infrastructure and standards of living as indicators of this coming demise. In this sense, the book is prophetic. Jared analyses the causes of collapse among ancient societies, from both an economical and environmental perspective, and connects their demise to current circumstances in our own. <br /> <br />I recently traveled through a rural portion of South Carolina and seen examples of Jared's thesis for myself. I noted entire communities gutted by lack of economic opportunity, farm fields abandoned, grain elevators and tobacco barns rusted and idle, and downtown areas empty. It was depressing. Where have the people gone?  In another example, my hometown in Southern California is dead. The once vibrant chemical industry is defunct, due to availability of similar products from Peru and Canada. My hometown failed to adapt to changes in the trade laws (NAFTA) and now finds itself unable to produce and sell a product, which sadly represents the bulk of the town's income. Naturally, people migrate out, and now Los Angeles County has recognized the town as a Godsend for cheap housing for welfare recipients. What a way to go. <br /> <br />Jared's message is disturbing, but at the same time he discusses how some societies managed to meet the challenges of population growth and economic and environmental transformations in a constructive manner. The information in this book appears to be well researched, and Jared's writing style makes it highly readable. <br />
B00000JY1X|5.0|You might be afraid this album is too cool to be actually good. BUT it is lovely and funny and brilliant. I love the sound and the content. When listening,I have an image of genius artists living in a communal apartment amusing themselves by composing these songs. Get it and be glad.
B00008973Q|5.0|After I got finished watching Ran I reflected on the fact that Japanese movies almost never have a happy ending. This is because the Japanese don't always need the happy ending, they can deal with the reality that life doesn't always have the good turn. With this in mind I realized that the Japanese must really love Shakespeare's tradegies. <br />Ran is Akira Kurosawa's retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear. An aging warlord wants to divide his kingdom into equal parts for his three sons. The youngest protests and warns that such a plan will breed rivalry. His elder brothers talk the warlord into doing it and the youngest is banished. After the warlord turns his throne over things begin to fall apart. The king is attacked at the famous Assualt of the Third Castle scene. His entourage is wiped out by his sons as they attack him. He goes mad, and escapes into the wilderness.  <br />Some people have called this an action movie. If you get this expecting to see dramatic samurai duels you will be sorely dissapointed. I would classify this as a graphic look at jealousy in humanity. The overwhelming desire for man to have more is captured in the bloody and decietful fight between the brothers. Kurosawa captures the ultimate suffering men can inflict on each other in order to better themselves. Not only do we see how the king is wronged by his sons we also see perhaps one of the most pitiable characters in the film, the former prince who had his eyes removed on the king's command. There are few likeable characters in this movie, only those to be pitied. <br />Kurosawa out does himself on the filming of Ran. The use of bright colors especially in the midst of battle is impressive. Through the smoke from musket fire are bright reds from the blood and banners flying as well as yellow banners. The knave is another standout, with his strange, jovial dress he really stands out in the cast. The king's wardrobe of white, the Eastern color of death, is appropriate since he caused somuch in his life and now it stalks him. <br />Despite criticisms of the poor quality DVD I really can see no problem with it. I would enjoy this film no matter what the contrast or screen size was. Ran is not really a film to sit down and enjoy. At no point could I tell myself that this was some kind of war film. Check out Ran, and have your mind blown.
0671027387|4.0|For me this book was a 5 star book - until the end which got rather laborious.  A lot of information that really did not have to do with the plot, just filler and I WANTED TO GET DONE!  Exciting all the way and a few goose bump moments.<br /><br />Another Dan Brown masterpeice.
0553577123|5.0|Not by the book, but by some of the reviews. Apparantly \\"this book blows,\\" as one reviewer tactfully put it. If you take time out to insult a girl who died in such tragic circumstances then you have serious issues. You wouldn't be particularly happy if you were the one locked up for two years, starving and crying in a concentration camp and then having people talk smack about you and your diary. If the book was seriously rubbish, thousands of people today would not be so moved and inspired by it. I'd like to make the assumption that you are too immature to understand the significance of it. Take a step back and don't accuse me of being Anne Frank's obsessed fan with no life when it is in fact you who need to get lives. And as for the book being boring, remember that most of what is written in it was intended for Anne's eyes only. She didn't open her diary and write the first entry thinking, \\"Hmmm, I'll bore my future readers to tears by writing the dullest diary I can!\\" Please, don't dishonor Anne Frank.
B000002UJQ|5.0|-----------This album is pure briliance, talent seeking out of its very pores. This album can be considered 5 star material, because of its effectiveness it brought upon towards the music industry and its listeners. There are people out there who do not like Radiohead for their dark lyrics and dark lifestyle, but I believe that these people don't quite understand how brilliant this work is and how it has changed rock music and lyrics and voice forever. This album has been a huge success, bringing a huge influence upon music today.  <br />-----------I think Radiohead gets their feelings and/or beliefs across more clearly in this album than they do in Pablo Honey and Bends. They begin a more well-known stereotype with this album in that it hit worldwide, shattering a huge barrier for Radiohead. The Bends in my beliefs should have started Radiohead's success, and I think it did, but not as much so for mostly everyone to realize until the release of OK Computer how great of on album Pablo Honey and The Bends are.  <br />-----------Each song on this album \\"rains down\\" upon you. Each song contains its own feeling. Some songs are rather spacy, dreamy, and dark, such as Sub. Homesick Alien. A great song for dreaming to. \\"Uptight\\" is a great lyrical representation of the feeling that is afflicted upon me through this song. A very emotive song in terms of its instrumental display from J. Greenwood.  <br />-----------With Subterranean Homesick Alien being my favorite song and following the classic Airbag and the long rock out of the instrumental classic Paranoid Android, this album has much more in store. After Sub. Homesick Alien, it leads into another very dreamy and rather dark epic, Exit Music (for a film). A very distraught and isolated lonely feel is cast upon most listeners, in that it is distorted in most areas and the synthesizers and the voice of Thom Yorke nearly put you to sleep with every listen. <br />-----------Well, next comes Let Down, probably my second favorite, although quite hard to say, in terms of the whole album containing different feels and different genres, each song being extraordinary. This song is more emotive and upbeat in terms of instrumental. Lyrically wise this is probably one of my fav's on OK Computer.  <br />-----------The next three songs sort of sink as one for me, Karma Police, Electioneering, and Climbing Up the Walls. Each three being very different according to genres, but very similar through the lyrics and background. Karma Police is a spectacular piano orchestrated hit. Then with electioneering, it turns into a more upbeat phenomenal voice displayed by Thom Yorke, (the voice and rhythm of this song are great). Then with Climbing Up the Walls, you are lead into a much more dark chill. A song worth \\"chilling\\" to. Again, Thom's vocal ability never fails. Just plain great.  <br />-----------No Suprises, a song for me based on a very bittersweet lyrically frozen melody. This song is swiftly important dealing with lyrics, and is shown within the video, words backwards right to left.                                 <br />                     <br />                  NO ALARMS AND NO SUPRISES  <br /> <br />-----------The last two, Lucky and the Tourist seem like a collage, turning into one song for me. Lucky, a song very far out with a backed up guitar off on off on off on off on, swivvles and ties itself in with Thom's vocal(reminds me of many Pink Floyd melodies.)No Suprises, written by Jonny, a great ending for the album. Ends with a sort of cashier \\"ding\\".  <br />-----------A great album, the foundation for fame in music that has been built since Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. A masterpiece and influential piece of brilliance.
B000002AH7|5.0|The closest you, as a consumer, will ever get to spanish music that's true, culturalwise. As I listen to it now, the image of a Spanish opera comes to mind. This album is meant to imply Spanish tones and brass. You would probably call that an abstract thought, but Miles Davis is one who ventured into the extraordinary and never returned. The thing about these albums is their conception of sound and their disguise. At first listen it will sound very foreign to your average 1-album-a-month listener, but if given the right attention and desperation by anyone, Miles will show. It's amazing how on his best albums Miles' most grandiose visions grow into life; like watching something out of the movie Fantasia. Perhaps the most evident proof is that while ten minutes into one of these sonnets, you pick up roots from many different cultures, directions; organic instruments and, if you listen carefully, that manic technique of juxtaposition that made the beatles so addictive. There is always that deception of organic instruments and notes at the begining of the album that make a song sound like normal. When playing to Miles though, wrap around and insulate the very breath of Miles. He grafts his thought to the orchestra, forcing them to go along and breath as one. Like Bitches Brew, you'll hear when and where the entire cultural genre is intruded upon, and all morph into a butterfly of some new arrangements of notes unheard by the human ear. To do this so smoothly in so many intervals is like brain chemicals changing. Buy this. <br />Also, this was number 360-something on the Rolling Stone 500 Most Essential Albums List. Mind you, it was a very liberal list that was not a list of \\"The Greatest Albums Ever\\". Just old fogeys from the San Fransisco era trying to force Revolver down young readers' throats. <br />
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game is a book for all. The storyline is great. We start by seeing how a 6-year-old genius is able to logically analyze and figure out how to defeat his enemy (another 6 year old) who happens to be bullying him. He is then sent to outer space to train in military command so that one day he may lead earth's fleets to the defeat of its alien invador's, the Buggers. Although some say that Card's transitions from 1st to 3rd person are a bit awkward at times, I found that I had no problem making the transitions while reading. Card's language is easy to understand and the book proves to be a very fast read. I found myself many times marking a page to find that I continued reading and had to mark it once again. I also  have to admit that I am not the most avid reader. I don't usually pick up books for fun. Still, I again must admit that I had very hard times putting down this book. The compelling storyline along with an incredible attention to technical details (like realizing the effects null gravity has on movement) makes the book a must-read. For example at one point Ender fights some boys in null gravity, yes geeks like me, there are null-gravity fights in this book, and changes his strategy to accommodate the differences in movement. I hate books in which the author spends pages describing the look on someones face, or the brilliance of the flower in front of the character. Card instead focuses on creating a storyline and focusing on it while still being able to make it easy to understand what is going on in the sorrounding area. Overall, Ender's game is a brilliant achievement of no only great storymaking but also plain entertainment. I recommend this book to anyone for a liking for science fiction.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|FIRST DAUGHTER has Forest Whitaker at the helm and with this gifted man's reputation he manages to salvage what could have been a bit of superficial fluff into a quiet statement about the private lives of public persons.<br /><br />The theme is straight forward enough: President of USA (Michael Keaton) is running for second term at the time his only perfect daughter Samantha (Katie Holmes) is off to college.  Her father and mother (Margaret Colin) accompany her to her California college with all the fanfare and security guards one might expect.  Sam wants to be 'just a normal person' and talks her assigned roommate Mia (Amerie Rogers) into sticking with her.  Despite the restrictions of 'life in a glass house', Sam finds joys and trials in trying to be a private person drowned in a public persona.  She falls for James her Residence Advisor (Marc Blucas) and that starts the errors in judgment that result in her being recalled to the White House until her father's election is over.  How Sam resolves her identity against the overwhelming odds and seeks her own existence is the punch of the closing of the film.<br /><br />In less than capable hands than those of Whitaker and his fine cast this film would have been extraneous bubble gum.  It just shows that good folks can give a weak plot a bit of pizzazz and manage to make some important social commentary despite a weak script.  Grady Harp, February 2005
B000002JPA|5.0|I first appreciated Dream Theater only after growing into modern progressive rock, having been stuck in 70s progressive rock for more than two decades.  The first Dream Theater album that I appreciated was the phenomenal \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\"  Once I realized how incredible that album was I moved on to this album from 1992.  I was stunned and fascinated by the difference between the two albums and think that both are enjoyable for completely different reasons.  One of the biggest differences to me was that the later album seemed to show fewer and different influences from this album, which reminded me more of Rush and seemed a bit more derivative than \\"Inner Turbulence.\\"  Regardless of the strength and number of influences, this album deals with less weighty topics than \\"Inner Turbulence\\" and is more of a \\"fun\\" album than \\"Inner Turbulence.\\"<br /><br />The CD begins with the fantasy song \\"Pull Me Under.\\"  While the topic is the inevitability of death, the spirited guitars, percussion and vocals generate catchy hooks that make you want to sing along, or at least hum along when you are unable to remember the words.  The locomotive bass drives this song filled with rowdy passengers, all of whom are along for the ride, and you have to wonder why anyone would worry about death with a song this good.<br /><br />\\"Another Day\\" is uncharacteristic of Dream Theater and most hard rock bands.  The style of the song is strongly reminiscent of 80s hair bands, mellow with a mild beat.  This tune features ear-friendly and even radio friendly hooks.  While the style may be very different from Dream Theater's more challenging works, this song is well performed and I enjoy the surrealistic feel to the lyrics.<br /><br />You can start rocking again with \\"Take the Time,\\" which speeds up and ramps up the power of the beat.  The technical sophistication of Dream Theater shows in this technically and vocally complex song.  While there remain elements similar to \\"Another Day,\\" Dream Theater's future musical direction is detectable.<br /><br />The pace slows again at the start of \\"Surrounded,\\" speeding up about a third of the way into the song.  The beat remains relatively friendly, the lyrics are poetic and fantasy based, and the general tone is upbeat.  After the frenetic center portion of this song the song slows dramatically at the end and becomes briefly introspective, perhaps conveying regret at the end of the dream.<br /><br />\\"Metropolis - Part I\\" is a song that is nine minutes and thirty-two seconds of playful fun.  The song was written by John Petrucci loosely based on Romulus and Remus from the \\"Aeneid.\\"  Romulus and Remus were linked telepathically and the lyrical elements of the song infer that link.  The song feels like a fantasy though the elements are mythology-based.  The tone of the song is upbeat and complex.  I keep wanting to use the word \\"fun\\" because this song combines the enthusiasm of Rush with the complexity of Yes in the unique style of Dream Theater.  I call this song ear candy.<br /><br />The next song is a grinder; \\"Under a Glass Moon\\" growls, rumbles, churns and vibrates.  The bass guitar grinds sound like a food processor and the drums frenetically punch you with their relentless rhythm.  The fantasy lyrics, the seven minute length, and the ever-intricate rock instrument composition are all indications that you are in the realm of progressive rock that has aged well.<br /><br />\\"Wait for Sleep\\" is a lovely piano and vocal interlude that calls forth imagery of someone lost in their thoughts, perhaps trying to escape their thoughts, perhaps dreading their dreams.  This pretty song indicates to the uninitiated that progressive rock is indeed one of the broadest of genres, capable of encompassing any suitable style.<br /><br />While much of this album is positive in tone, \\"Learning to Live\\" is more contemplative and somber.  I have read elsewhere that the song is about AIDS.  However, the lyrics may be more broadly read to cover any situation where your priorities have changed to surviving, perhaps from an incurable disease, but depression could be included as well.  At eleven and a half minutes this song is the longest on this CD, but it moves briskly with a fast and intricate progressive rock beat.  This song seemed to me to be the most Yes-influenced song on the CD, particularly during the middle portion, which contains wonderful instrumental variations, including acoustic guitar.  Instrumentally this song contains some of the most interesting music on this CD.<br /><br />The music on this CD is very different from \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\"  The compositions are closer to hard rock with more influences from groups such as Yes and Rush.  It seems to me that the later album shows how much Dream Theater has evolved its own style in the last 10 years.  Surprisingly, I also thought that this album contained more traditional progressive rock elements than the later album (perhaps read old-fashioned, if there can be such a thing in progressive rock).  After listening to this CD several times, I think it would have made a great soundtrack to the fantasy movie \\"Ladyhawke.\\"<br /><br />I can understand how some listeners might prefer this album to later albums such as \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence,\\" which to my ear is musically current versus the strong 80s flavor of \\"Images and Words.\\"  I like both CDs for very different reasons.  The later album is very technically sophisticated and socially relevant, while this album focuses on fantasy and mythology imagery that Dream Theater tried to describe lyrically and musically.  Both albums contain well-crafted and performed music that will challenge the ability of listeners to learn to appreciate the intricacies of Dream Theater's music.  This CD is surely a worthy addition to any progressive rock music fan's library.may be more broadly read to cover any situation where your priorities have changed to surviving, perhaps from an incurable disease, but depression could be included as well.

B00008PX8P|5.0|This was for me the concert film of all concerts, I'd enjoyed The Song Remains The Same but this was different.Not only did I get to see and hear the band from its early days i also got to relive the Earls Court and Knebworth Concerts. The quailty of the over head video feed at Earls Court along with the audio feed recreates the feeling of being there, the accoustic set is a memoerable occassion the only problem I have is the echo off the back wall appears to have been removed and that both Page and Plant did use the entire stage Page being the master showman not quite appreciated on film.    There is a genuine feeling of excitement that comes lunging out from the Tv when i watch this section of the film and I sing along to Bron Y Aur just as I did on the night.    Knebworth it was a big field thousands of people there and some good songs missed off the disc Kashmir was and always will be dynamic it was already a close second at Earls Court and on this night was proberbly their finest along with No quarter and since. The songs viewed are great though if you where there then its a great memory and good to see two outstanding British concerts featured, if you weren't there well its propberbly the best you'll get to see them.    I shouldn't forget that the first disc is the famous RAH gig so three great concerts filmed in Britain    One thing about these two dics if you put disc 2 into your player and press menu you can access a whole lotta easter eggs not mentioned on the cover.  And yes a very happy memory that will never ever fade.    Amazon  Good Night
B000683VI4|5.0|This is by far one of the best romantic movies I have ever watched. I rented it to watch it and simply pass the time, but got hooked on the story and the characters. I normally don't like the author of the book and find most his books and movies to be about the same, but this one is different. I can't tell you too much about the story cause you really don't want to give the plot away. I highly recommend this movie. Anyone who doesn't like this movie is insane. Every actor is great, the plot is great and you can really feel the heartbreak throughout it.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie made me cry so many times, that I lost count. This is a romantic and breathtaking movie. The book is even better!!! This movie caught a couple of details that the book has, which for many movies this dosent happen. <br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone that believes love is greater than anything.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.  <br /> <br />Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (\\"Encore\\", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).  <br /> <br />D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here.
0385510454|3.0|I would like to think I am in the prime demographic for The Broker. I very much enjoyed Grisham's earlier works that focused on one lawyer against a more powerful, less ethical force. . . and some of my favorite books are Tom Clancy's cold war, spy thrillers - Cardinal of the Kremlin and Red Storm Rising, for example. Grisham succeeds in approaching his old form for the former genre but leaves so many loose ends astray in the latter that this is an unrewarding read. <br /> <br />For example, so many characters are introduced that appear for 100 pages or so and then just disappear - I was certain the professor was a Red China sleeper agent, else why so much talk of communism? Then there is all this build up with the Red China assassin and then never a confrontation? Why even bother with this character and so many others that are developed if they never play a role in the story. <br /> <br />Also, what happens to Joel? Are we to believe that he returns to Italy and has a fairy tale romance? Are Neal and his family really able to return to a normal life? Doubtful in the real world . . . Clearly China will not go away and moreover the remaining governments just \\"back-off\\" because of a call from the CIA? Sure, the CIA would never lie to foreign governments and other countries would just take the U.S. at its word. <br /> <br />And a system of spy satellites that are rendered \\"useless\\" by three programmers? Please.  <br /> <br />To top it all off, the ending of the novel seems so rushed, as if Grisham grew tired with his foray into the spy genre and just wanted to get it over with. I think Grisham sums it up best himself in his very odd Author's Note at the end of novel . . . \\"If something in this novel approaches accuracy, it's probably a mistake.\\" Net/net, a fun read with an dissatisfying, perplexing finish that dramatically oversimplifies the world. Even Mitch McDeere couldn't go back to practicing law at the end of The Firm.
B0007GBBVO|5.0|I recently bought this DVD and man, am I glad having done so. <br />Although I'm a european resident, the NTSC disc plays fine here in PAL-country and I had a lot of fun watching this smart little self-ironic horror movie in 3D. the disc offers an intro and a dvd-menu, both in 3D and also a testing chart, to be used to properly adjust the 3d-glasses or any other means of viewing. The image is razor sharp and because the set was always well lit, the 3D effect is always at it's best. the movie is presented in a letterbox format, that's a good thing. a slightly bad one is, that the widescreen image has been blown up and part of the image at left and right sides is missing, due to vignetting caused by the stereovison system used during shooting, as I was informed. that is a little pitty, but no reason to avoid this real cool and professional 3D DVD. <br />\\"The  Creeps\\"' story is playing with stereotypes of b-grade horror movies <br />and reaches one of it's many peaks when four famous monsters of classic horror movies come to live, but in small size. <br />one must see the tiny dracula with a mexican accent who's asking \\"What's that - movie?\\". <br />For those like me, who like to sit through the end credits there's a jolly, musical \\"secret scene\\" at the very ending of the movie. <br />After having bought and seen a lot of crap on the 3D field-sequential 3D DVD market, I would buy blindly every single further DVD that comes from this company.

Imagine \\"The Creature from the Black Lagoon\\" in an 3D DVD edition like \\"The Creeps\\"- Sharp, splendid looking? Wouldn't that be just great? <br />
B000687M48|5.0|I love this CD. This is one of the best live CD's I have heard in a long time. Recorded in Paris, the CD starts out with Haunted, though Amy get's kind of off-beat during the song, still the CD is more like a live version of Fallen (A excellent album no matter what they say about my girl Amy Lee). Though when I first got it, I thought this was going to be like all of live CD's, but this is different. How? Well it sounds like you are in the crowd listening to them, and this is definitely a CD that die-hard Evanescence fan's would love. Another song they do is Korn's \\"Thoughtless\\" which I thought kicked ass! Most of the other song's like \\"Whisper\\", \\"Taking Over Me\\", \\"Missing\\", \\"Going Under\\", and most of Fallen is on the CD. There are times where Amy Lee screams more than sings, but doing \\"My Immortal\\" she shows her singing skills, but most of the album she is screaming the words instead on Fallen where she sing's, but live she mostly screams. The DVD I thought was okay, I mean it had some good behind-the-scenes of Evanescence and the music video's of \\"Going Under\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\" (which they also perform on the live CD) \\"Everybody's Fool\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" Evanescence does a band version on the CD which I like the band version more than the original version. If you listen to the solo's from Fallen and on Anywhere But Home, they are totally different because Ben Moody left the band when they were promoting Fallen.  <br /> <br />If you already have Fallen, Anywhere But Home is just the same album except it is live and you got the unreleased song \\"Missing\\" on it. If you are a die-hard Evanescence fan like myself, this is a must.
0930289234|5.0|Not only is this the best comic I've ever read, it's one of the best books I've ever read. It really takes multiple reads to understand how truly genius it is. I stopped collecting comics when I was a teenager, but I still pick up an Alan Moore graphic novel every now and then, because he's the best there is, and pretty much everything he does is incredible. If you only read one comic in your life, make it Watchmen.<br /><br />Or New Mutants 94.
0780619951|1.0|I wasn't planning on writing a review of \\"Dr, Moreau\\" 1996, as it is an inconsequential and wholly forgettable movie, but when I read reviews that described it as \\"intelligent,\\" I felt I had to write a response.  \\"Dr. Moreau\\" 1996 is NOT an intelligent movie.  Like most bad science fiction it shows contempt for the viewers' intelligence. <br /> <br />The plot revolves around a scientist, Dr. Moreau (Brando) who lives on an island where he is turning animals into humanoids in order to create a race without malice.  Now, while this motive (a huge departure from the original book) has a grain of interest in it, that single grain is lost as the plot unfolds.  Dr. Moreau controls his race with pain and injections of street drugs, hardly elements condusive to discouraging malice.  He has given them a set of laws to obey, but in previous tellings of the story the law was simple and easy to repeat in an almost ritualized fashion.  This movie has Ronald Perlman reciting the law in long, pretentious speeches.  How are the humanoids supposed to rememeber, and thus obey, these long narrations? <br /> <br />Assisting Dr. Moreau is Montgomery (Kilmer), who is described as a brilliant neurosurgeon.  Despite this description, he neither says nor does a single brilliant thing during the movie.  At various times he behaves oddly, a forced attempt to make him seem unstable that only comes off as goofy.  At other times he flaunts the order of the island and ignores the potential for  rebellion among the humanoids.  It is hinted that he is so erratic because of drug use, which only begs the question of why the \\"genius\\" Dr. Moreau keeps this dangerous and unstable individual around. <br /> <br />The hero of the story, Douglas (Thewlis) is supposedly a UN negotiator.  This implies that he is capable of dealing with differences among people and tense situations, including potential violence.  However, he shows unbridled disgust for most of Moreau's creations and continuously comes across as a coward.      For example, there is a boat that can take him to Timor, a few days away.  He won't take it, however, because there is a ratman in a cage (yes, in a cage) guarding it.  Plus, whenever there is gunfire, he cringes into a ball, some hero. <br /> <br />And speaking of gunfire, there are evidently tons of guns on the island for the humanoids to use during the predictable (and unimpeded by the \\"genius\\" Moreau) rebellion scene.  Why does Moreau keep guns around when he is trying to build a malice free society?  Why does he need so many when he and Montgomery are the only ones who might use them?  Why didn't some one involved in the movie wonder about this? <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but I think I've made my point.  I would add that the special effects, while entertainingly gruesome at times, contribute little to the story.  The humanoid make-up does not represent an improvment over the 1977 version of the story, and thus cannot be cited as a saving grace.  Overall, \\"Dr. Moreau\\" 1996 presents as just another insipid, poorly designed movie that Hollywood frequently tries to pass off as \\"science fiction.\\"
0312995423|5.0|I was very bored the first couple of chapters, but as the book progressed, I couldn't put it down.  A lot of the terms used were very confusing and sometimes I would skip over sentences, but you could understand the jist of what the author was trying to say.  I found myself trying to play detective and figure it out, but when it was all said and done, I really had no idea \\"whodunnit\\"  I would highly recommend this book if you are looking for a great afternoon reading.
B0006419J6|5.0|Originally, when I saw the previws for this film, I thought \\"Great, another movie with Will Smith saving the world.\\" then, when I saw it after my sister bought it on dvd, I was surprised at just how much I likedit. I found myself wanting to watch it again within the next couple of days. The thought of the world being so technological has always fascinated me, but I have to admit, I can't make myself believe it's ever going to be quite as technical as this movie. It's kind of scary to think that we may one day depend on robots to do so many things, but who knows. I almost hope it doesn't happen in my generation. Flying cars and things like that are just a little to much for me. But, I give this 5 stars. It still amazes me how people think so extensively about the future.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I saw the Theatrical version and I thought it was good. I couldn't understand why so many hated it. But after watching the Director's Cut, I understood. A lot of things were unexplained and it did lack story. It was more about everyone wanting to kill DD. The Director's Cut is almost like a different movie altogether. It was more about DD defending the innocent and protecting his territory like it was supposed to. Another reason I think people would hate it is Ben Affleck who I don't have any problems with. You might have seen Gilgi or Raindeer Games and desided that he sucks. Well, he was great in Daredevil, and I hope if a sequel is made he reprises his role. The bar fight scene is awesome and he did his own fight scenes. Micheal Clarke Duncan to me is the only guy who could play Wilson Fisk, who is white in the comics. But that's really the only thing he lacked to play the character and I feel it doesn't matter. He's got the size, the deep voice, and the charisma of the Kingpin. Colin Ferrell was perfect as Bullseye. He was as sadistic and egotistical as the comic book Bullseye. He didn't wear the costume from the comics but it would have looked goofy. Jennifer Garner was great as Elektra and her fight scenes were beautifully done. I feel that Ben and Jen also had on-screen chemistry and you want them to be together, at least I did. Also I feel that people overlook the performance of Jon Faverau as Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson who gets more screen time in this version. He's a welcome source of comic relief from all the gloom and doom in the movie. <br /> <br />It depends on what you want from a comic book movie. If you want an \\"in-and-out-in-80-minutes\\" movie that's all about quick action, get the theatrical cut. But if you want to see story with developing characters and take a journey with a hero and see what his dark world is like get the Director's Cut. Or get both. I have both versions, and I placed the Director's Cut disc with Disc 2 of the Theatrical Cut and created a sort of an \\"ultimate edition.\\"

0670033375|5.0|Yes, it's only February, but the odds that someone will write a book more important than this one anytime in the near future are pretty low. Those who dismiss Diamond as a \\"determinist\\" ignore the whole point of this book: Societies don't fail or succeed based on their surroundings. They fail or succeed based on how they interact with those surroundings. Societies that adapt their values and practices to match what their environment can provide to them on a sustainable basis thrive; those that persist in practices that deplete their resources ultimately fail. He backs this notion up with examples from the past and present that are both fascinating and compelling.    But Diamond's remarkable insight is this: For the first time in human history, we have the ability to see our resource use--and depletion--on a global scale, and to recognize how our actions impact others and how their actions impact us. We can harness this new knowledge to sustain our planet, or we can continue on a path that leads nowhere but ruin. Some may not like that message, but Diamond is both honest about how he arrives at his conclusions and optimistic that humanity can solve its problems. It's not overstating the case to say that the higher the number of people who read this well-researched and well-reasoned book, the more warranted Diamond's optimism will be. If you've got the time, read Guns, Germs and Steel first; these two work best together.
B000002UAU|5.0|Any polular musi historian will tell you this is the best album ever made. I tend to disagree but it certainly be in the running for greatest of all time.  It is praised for the revolutionary editing that rears up its head on \\"A Day in The Life\\" and other tracks.  <br /> <br />My main beef is that it was made as a concept album.  The Beatles choose produce the album as SGt. Pepper's Longly Hearts Club Band. the first couple of tracks follow the concept but it veres off throughout the recording.   <br /> <br />Also the album really lacks flow.  For Expample, \\"Within You\\" is a song about five minutes long, with heavy sitar lines, and my god lyrics that don't make any sense.  The song is immeadiatley followed by \\"Sixty-four\\", an early Beatles pure pop tune that you could snap your finger too.
068987474X|1.0|This book was a waste of money.  Most of the material revealed in this book was obvious.  In addition, this book focuses a lot on what men do inorder to decide whether or not a guy is into a particular women.  But it takes two people to make a relationship of any kind work.  I am not defending men and their ways.  But ladies, if you don't do your part, no matter how much a guy is into you, he is not going to show it or waste his time.  I have asked some of my male friends about stuff revealed in this book and they say that it is somewhat true.  But they also say it depends on what the lady does that makes them act the way they act.  I don't know what group of people were surveyed for this book, but some of the letters to Greg seemed stupid. Who would really write letter like those. As far a comedy, the book was not even really entertaining.
0385510454|5.0|John Grisham has done it.  He has been able to capture the suspence of The Firm and take the reader with him. He's got his suspense back!  His descriptions of Italy give the flavor of Europe and I knew he had been there to be able to capture it all. A good read, relaxing and rewarding. His writing is easy on the mind with just enough suspense thrown in to keep the pages turning. He brings government into your home and makes you question: \\"Could this possibly happen to me?\\"  Enjoy
0385510454|2.0|John Grisham seems to be writing now because his agent or someone else ask him to write. His heart and consequently, his soul, is not in it. Grisham is not a spy novelist, so he is obviously out of his element here. The novel is slow; a lot of the characters seem contrived. Teddy Maynard, the CIA director, looks like \\"Dr. Stranglove.\\" Most of the book is a travelogue. The ending is rushed and forced. And the idea of him heading off in the sunset to meet his \\"soul mate,\\" for want of a better term, is too much. Please, John, get better or find another line of work.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm reading some of the negative reviews and I can't understand how anyone can not love this album. No she's not like the genie in a bottle girl anymore...SHE GREW UP. That's what you do. Britney should grow the hell up and talk about real adult issues. I was blown away by this album and impressed by her honesty. If people can look passed the wardrobe choices and realize that she has an amazing story to tell and no one tells it like her. I felt that Keep on Singing my Song should have been her last single instead of The Voice Within. KOSMS really summed up how she feels about what people say about her. It's the \\"middle finger\\" to the naysayers. This album is one of the best I have ever heard and I can't wait to hear what else she has to say. She forever has a fan in me.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Michael Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, generated considerable controversy with good reason. It is difficult to imagine anyone viewing the film, especially during 2004, an election year, without developing rather strong feelings about the subject matter. From the title of the film alone, the viewer prepares for a gut-wrenching experience in preparation for watching a documentary that intends to shoot from the hip and does so relentlessly and without apology. Producer/director Michael Moore's appearance in his own film makes it clear that he acts purely from personal motivation in creating such a film at such a strategic time. The question that many are trying to ask is: is Michael Moore pro-American, anti-American, anti-Bush, or what? How can any person conceive of such a disturbing film to show to a public that is still living in the trauma of the event s of September 11, 2001 unless he is trying to convey a message? Even more of a question is: just what are we supposed to understand from this film? Is this Michael Moore's day in the sun, or is it an indictment of President George W. Bush?    Moore's dislike of President Bush and the Bush family is obvious from the start. The film paints a very negative picture of the Bush family as being driven only by oil-based wealth that is linked directly to the Bin Laden family, the Saudi royal family, and various personalities that are all apparently \\"in on the deal\\" in terms of generating profits from all the events that developed before and after September 11, 2001. Moore makes it a point of presenting the idea that the tragedy of September 11, 2001 was a carefully orchestrated event performed with the knowledge and, more than likely, consent of the Bush family at a time when Bush was, as the film states, \\"on vacation\\" as his popularity rating plunged. The film is truly a cynic's delight in making the point that everything that took place on September 11, 2001 had but one purpose: to generate more wealth for the Bush familyand the Saudis, both of whom enjoy an immense amount of protection by the Secret Service.    Moore's appearance in the film adds an element that makes him open for caustic criticism, as he is neither photogenic nor particularly tactful. The one element that compensates for what many may believe to be Moore's exaggerated ego in making himself a feature in his own film is the obvious sincerity in which he pursues his subject; nobody viewing the film can doubt that he believes very strongly in what he says. His visit back to his hometown of Flint, Michigan hits hard, as he shows the economic devastation in the city and the aggressive efforts to recruit the many young people affected by the economic blight into the military. The footage showing the bereaved family of Sergeant Michael Pedersen hits home in a way that cannot be ignored, unfortunately, by anyone viewing the film.    The filmed carnage of the war in Iraq, a major feature of the film, evokes memories of the Vietnam War for persons old enough to remember that era; persons from later generations for whom the Vietnam War is only a name from history cannot ignore the grim reality that the war in Iraq is something that has already impacted American society permanently. The film, however, makes a compelling point that the one and only motive for launching the war in Iraq was commercial and suited the needs of the Bush oil empire more than protected the American people, which was the reason President Bush appears in the film as stating as the objective of the war. Add to that the sight of Lila Lipscombe, the mother of Sergeant Michael Pedersen , who, by her own admission, is a \\"conservative Democrat\\" and who states openly that she is proud to be American, weeping over her son's death, and the result is a frontal attack that provoked talk in the Bush administration of possibly banning the film. Had the Bush administration taken such an unprecedented measure, Michael Moore would have become a martyr nationwide immediately, and the impact of such an action on Bush's chances for re-election would have been felt acutely.    The actual attack on September 11, 2001, interestingly enough, takes up so little time in the film that it might seem to some viewers almost insignificant, but it is, in fact, the focus of the entire film. Moore depicts the attack as an event of which the Bush administration had ample prior knowledge and could have prevented simply by monitoring the many Al Qaeda members, most of whom were Saudi nationals, residing in the United States and studying in American flight schools at the time the attack took place. President Bush is depicted as a President-on-vacation throughout the entire period of crisis, and the message that comes across is that the September 11, 2001 attack was only one part of a scheme to manipulate the public into a mindset of terror so that a grandiose scam could be carried out that would generate profits for American firms connected with defense contracting and fossil-fuel energy sources, as well as the Saudi royal family, who, according to the film, is so close to the Bush family as to be regarded as related.    The film makes no pretense at being balanced in its views. No attempt is made to convince the viewer that the report is nonpartisan or unbiased. The audience sees exactly what Michael Moore wants it to see, and Moore does a superb job of presenting his views in a clear, concise manner on film. The viewer is, therefore, compelled to decide whether to accept the film as an accurate documentary or political propaganda aimed at dislodging George W. Bush from the Presidency. Bush's rather hostile policies toward the underprivileged sectors of the population will probably mean that the film will generate almost unanimous support of Moore's views, especially when they see the exploitation of the victims of the economy. In light of the way Moore pointed out accurately that many of the people living in the economic plight in the United States live in conditions not altogether different from those that exist in war-torn areas of Iraq at that time, persons who wondered if they had anything to hope for in terms of simple survival would surely have expressed their views in November 2004. History relates, however, that Bush was re-elected as President, so if Michael Moore's goal was to prevent re-election, clearly he did not achieve his goal.    Is the film worth seeing? From a historical standpoint, it is. It is, however, definitely not for the faint of heart, and a person who seeks to keep stress levels down might find the film unduly upsetting. However, even if a viewer agrees or disagrees with Moore's documentary, the film has recorded beliefs held by the public that will not go away.
B000058A1G|5.0|Normally I'm a real smart-alecy buster when it comes to these reviews, but let me tell you that this stuff is up there with the best of The Small Faces and is much better than early Who, (and I love early Who!)  I know Phil Collins says that The Action are one of his favorite bands.  Don't let that stop you from checking them out, he sounds NOTHING like them.  Shadows and Reflections is a marvel, but it's the Since I Lost My Baby that is the show stopper.  The best Brit.  aranbee slowjam cover.  Must be heard to be believed.  Ace, as I hear they used to say.
1591840562|3.0|I love Guy's books, but this title was trying to be everything to everyone. Good tips inside, but its very broad target dampers the book's effectiveness.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is genius.  I have never been so blown away.  A friend of mine gave this album to another friend for his birthday and we listened to it immediately.  Since then (2 years back) the album never leaves my side.  It never gets old...it can't even be accurately described...take my advice and just buy it...you will not regret it...and if you ever have the chance to see him live..DO...I still have chills. Hands down my favorite Artist of all time and THAT my friends is a BOLD statement for me.  Thanks for reading.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|This album is a decent compilation of their popular hits. Get this if you enjoyed G'N'R back in the day but weren't too deep into them. As a casual listener back then, I myself enjoyed other hits from them as well. But these hits that have been selected are very nostalgic and a great way to introduce G'N'R to people who aren't familiar with their music (mainly your teen kids). A good showcase of their style indeed.
6302158095|5.0|I am a classical music lover and this is one of the best examples of portrayal of music I've ever seen.  Aside from opera this film is a gem in the music industry.  I fell in love with this when I first saw it in the theater.  Schuberts Ave Maria sent chills up and down my spine as I sat enthralled by it's beauty and magnifence in this film.  This movie is perfect for home theater and a noble way to show it off.  To think of this film as anything short of a masterpiece is to do it an injustice.
B000067F7Q|5.0|(1) Let's start with Bury Me an Angel. The opening to this song just rings with perfection, and when that chorus riff comes in you just can't help but engross yourself fully in the music. The slow solo at the end is really a powerful moment. <br />(2) Dark Insanity's ultra-fast chorus riff is just made awesome by Erlandsson's sweet drumming. The entrance of the solo on this song is amazing. <br />(3) No song here beats Eureka's beast of a verse-chorus riffing combo. The combination of these two riffs probably ties it with Bury Me an Angel for favorite. <br />(4) I really like the solo and verse, although in some ways I think that the chorus could have been more interesting. <br />(5) Cosmic Retribution's drumming is something powerful, especially entering the chorus. Really cool. Lyrics are pretty cool too. <br />(6) Demonality is a short instrumental. Thankfully short. Kind of repetitve. <br />(7) Transmigration Macabre has some serious head-banging quality with the great blend of speed and bass-china cybal slow beat chorus. Very strange lyrics. <br />(8) Time Capsule is a pretty cool short instrumental. Very different flavor from the rest of the album. Neat. <br />(9) Fields of Desolation has an absolutely killer blend of riffs that draw you heavily into the song. The only problem is that it gets kind of repetitve, seeing as it basically repeats until that last, kinda standard solo. I really like the version on Wages of Sin. <br />(10) Losing Faith. Not amazing, but cool. <br />(11) Ides of March (Iron Maiden?)Another short instrumental, kinda neat. <br />(12) This Aces High cover is a great finisher for the album. Phew, it rivals the original song for greatness. Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br />Over all, except for a few \\"not stunning\\"'s, this album compiles some of Arch Enemy's best work (and makes me adore their work more and more everyday). Black Earth for me ties with Burning Bridges, with maybe a slight disadvantage, for my favorite Arch Enemy album, and consequently, favorite Death Metal album.
0767818040|1.0|This film has very bad haircuts, terrible buildup and the film doesn't even take off until about an hour in and by then you don't care because the music has driven you insane. Basically a guy is given a penthouse type apartment to look after with a telescope. De Palma films most of the movie with this guy looking through it and the music in the background and forty minutes later after waking up you find he is still doing the same thing again.<br /><br />Then suddenly a bad guy appears from nowhere and starts to stalk the people in the apartments across the way....<br /><br />... and you know you have seen this done better elsewhere.<br /><br />... thus punch in the words \\"REAR WINDOW\\" in the search box and do motion picture films justice.
B000002L9S|5.0|Madonna's third album was a giant leap forward for her.  She really improved as both a singer and a songwriter.  This was the first album that she had a hand in writing all the songs.  And what songs they are!  Five of these songs were huge hits that everyone is familiar with; \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"Live to Tell\\", \\"True Blue\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\".  These are some of the best pop songs of the era.  And the other four songs here are also good.  \\"White Heat\\" uses being arrested as a metaphor for giving in to love, and features actual dialogue from the movie White Heat (I love both the song and the movie).  \\"Where's the Party\\" is a fun song about... partying.  \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" is probably the most inconsequential song here, but it is still a fun song.  \\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\" is a rather naive plea for peace, but it has a good beat and you can dance to it (if you can dance, which I can't).  This was Madonna's first truly great album, and it's an essential purchase for all her fans.
B0001Z37HM|1.0|People left the cinema during this one... and rightly so, the special effects for a 1980s fantasy swashbuckler where like something out of a 1950s Flash Gordon episode. As soon as Arnaughlt starts tossing the fake metal sea serpent about himself like Bella Lugosi in Ed Wood, you know that the film is lost.<br /><br />Although the ending is not half-bad, films like Krull, Beastmaster and Conan at least have a budget for the set design. In Red Son--ee-yaahhh, the sets are made out of tin-foil, and it even looks like tin-foil! Imagine the old RANK logo with the gold gong. Imagine that stuff everywhere... pretending to be metal... but just paper blowing in the breeze. Somebody maybe conjured miracles on a $100 design budget, but to be honest it just looks like someone forgot to fire the production designer. Even Arnauhglt wears this totally g@y headband.<br /><br />The story goes something along the lines of a green glowing gem that only women can use has been snatched by a wicked woman who takes it to her castle to rule the universe. Red Son-ee-yaahhh, played by Neilson, turns up to quest for the gem, meets Arnaughlt  who says a few lines under a heavy accent, mainly just there for showing off his abs, meet up with a really annoying kid from china who can do kung-foo (yeah I think you get the picture).<br /><br />The film throws only one half-good sword fight near the end with some prequel fights that never really leave the ground. The bad special effects made us laugh out loud in 1985 and then sneek into the other screen. You can only imagine what it looks like 2005.<br /><br />This is quite possibly Arnaughlts worst film in his collection. Certainly forget he was ever in this and go get the two Conan movies instead. Why bother with this? To be honest it feels like the producers are just trying to make a quick buck on a fem-conan spin-off... which is not such a bad idea... and neither is Neilson... but the whole production is like your six year old made it in class.n class.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|This is not a great film, it is far too long, and it is just about void of any great acting. If I had to choose \\"Best Actor\\" for this film, it would be Eric Bana. Really an excellent job considering the script he had to work with. Apart from that, the other actors would have been just as convincing if they were on a Greek stage holding dramatic masks to their faces. It seemed Brad Pitt was always trying to act but just couldn't jive with the character. I actually wanted to laugh at some parts, such as when he was \\"acting\\" angry while calling Hector out to fight. Terrible. Peter O'Toole, though once a great actor, is just too old, and I hate to say that. I sincerely believe that Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole were recruited because the producers wanted some \\"big name\\" appeal. Shame. To set the record straight, I do not dislike Brad Pitt. I thought he was great in \\"Fight Club\\" and other films. But perhaps he should avoid the epic.
0385510454|1.0|Well to begin with, I got this book as one of my free selections through joining a literary book club and only paid three dollars for it. And its a good thing because if i had to pay full price for this book, it would have been sent back. This book wasn't good, i was so disappointed.<br /><br />The begining moves along pretty quickly, which is ok because i thought that there was just enough attention given to the development of the characters and i liked how the story was taking shape.<br /><br />The middle slowed down quite a bit and the story really developed on its setting and characters(which by then there were only a few anyway). This is where some reviewers had said it became exremely boring and read like a tourist travel guide. I work as a chef and am infatuated with Italy, so i didnt mind reading about a country that just mystifies me. But considering that this is supposed to be a book written by John Grisham, the middle was boring with very little action.<br /><br />Then there was the ending. I thought that some reviewers were just trying to be harsh at first. But once you read the end youll have to agree that they were all right in their judgements. The story pace now takes on lightning speed compared to the rest of the novel, and ends within about eighty pages. This was the most hazardously constructed part of the whole book. We all wait patiently to find out what this has all been about, and not only are we cut off in the midstream of the ending, we dont even get any closure as to what happens to any of the main characters that we have been painstakingly reading about for the last three hundred pages. I actually went to the bookstore to check out other copies to see if i was robbed of some pages in the shipping and packing process. I was shocked to discover that all of the other copies had the same ending. I couldnt believe that the great John Grisham could have actually put his name on this. I dont think his intention was to make a sequal or miniseries, which wouldnt be necessary if we had about another hundred pages of action and closure.<br /><br />In closing, if you can get this book at the library, borrow it from a friend, or only pay a buck or two for it, then by all means go ahead. You still might not like it. But please dont waste twenty four of you hard earned dollars on a copy of this rinky dink amature fiction. Its not worth any where near that amount. I was so shocked with this book. It was so hyped up and looked so good at first, and the story idea did intrigue me, but it was written so poorly that i had to ask; Was this John Grisham that actually wrote this??eries, which wouldnt be necessary if we had about another hundred pages of action and closure. <br /> <br />In closing, if you can get this book at the library, borrow it from a friend, or only pay a buck or two for it, then by all means go ahead.

Cool new concept, but not much to get fired up about.
0385508417|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and I have to say, the book is MUCH better. \\"Skipping Christmas\\" is a very touching novel almost like a fable for adults. We all dream of skipping the costs of Christmas and picking up and leaving.

0156029065|5.0|Eco is astonishing!   I read this in English translation, but his love of language is evident and delightful.   His grasp of history is expert; really funny stuff and really sad stuff ... shows how tragedy spawns comedy. <br />The character Baudolino is endearing as the reader joins him on adventures from medieval trangressions to scientific endevour, to Pliny's book on the Natural World. <br />A rollicking book, bawdy, humorous, visual and full of enough symbolic stuff to keep any 'seeker of secret knowledge' turning the page.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Anytime a studio saturates the media with endless promotions touting its latest epic, air raid alarms should alert any saavy movie goer to the bombs about to fall. This film is to Pearl Harbor what Falcon Crest was to wine. Two and one half hours of boilerplate love triangle tedium cannot be offset by 30 minutes of special effects calculated to pump some excitement into the veins that Kate,Ben,and Josh just couldn't muster. Computer regurgitations of unlikely aircraft maneuvers are as realistic as they are phony. If that sounds conflicted, blame it on the story line. If only the Japanese would have telegraphed their intentions as clearly as the writers of Mr. Affleck's characters' destiny, Pearl Harbor would have had more than ample time to prepare a much warmer welcome. But I gotta hand it to the studio machine. They were clever enough to trot out (with much fanfare) aging WW2 veterans for the world premier. No reports as to how many of the true survivors of Pearl Harbor fell asleep while enduring this debacle. If you are more than mildly interested in some of the events surrounding Dec 7, 1941, a much better film has long been released. It is called \\"Tora Tora Tora\\".
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Well they messed up a could've been a \\"great\\" greatest hits cd (what's new).How in the world could you leave off \\"Mr Brownstone\\" from the \\"Appetite..\\" album? They are nuts to leave that hit off.And my all time favorite GNR song,\\"Estranged\\".They should have left off \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" and \\"Since I Don't Have You\\" both being the lamest songs on here.And added something else like a true single(s).I know they were cramped for space since most cds only have 80 minutes worth of space.Throw in a edit somewhere couldve worked.But anyways you still get the big hits all around.Like always they gotta use the stupid digi-pak for this one.I dont like my cd cover getting ruined, why don't they understand that.(I know it's cheaper for them to make cardboard.)This cd would've been out sooner but frontman Axl Rose threw a fit over the release of it,so did the rest of the former members.Anyways GNR gave the rights away to use their songs used in tv ads,movies,radio,etc.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Disgusting.  Trash without any redeeming value. Violent to the point of making one feel depersonalised. If you want your children to become murderers, this is the film to get them. Tarantino has a great sense of black humor but none of it came out in this film. It was just degrading <br />and sick. On my 5 worst list of all times.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is one you listen to all the way through and appreciate it more and more each time.   <br /> <br />For me, the highlight of this album is \\"Vanishing\\".  Listen to this song on repeat 3-4 times.  With each time you notice a little more of how each instrument contributes to the whole.  The song really sounds better each time.   <br /> <br />Eventually, just close your eyes and relax.  You will realise what an unbelievable ability they have to manipulate your feelings through music (ie. rhythm changes that coincide perfectly with beautiful vocal harmonies).  The song is not heavy at all but the pulse makes it \\"feel\\" heavy!   <br /> <br />\\"Gravity\\" is my second favorite.  The vocals are extremely powerful, yet crystal clear especially towards the end of the song.  What a fantastic voice!! <br /> <br />These people are genuine artists and there is not much of that out there.  I look forward to there next work.

044024157X|4.0|I absurdly enjoyed this JG novel.  Agree do I with many of the other reviewers, insomuch as this is a quasi-change from his (JG's) earlier novels.  That said, however, the characters in _TLJ_ are what moves the story, not so much the plot (rednecks vs. city folk), which is kind of tepid at best.  Nonetheless, this, in my opinion, would be a great beach/trip read: easy to follow plot, hysterical characters (antagonists), and the obligatory \\"alcohol hobby\\" of several more...all make for a relaxing read. <br /> <br />Buy it in paperback. <br /> <br />Cheers.
0802130208|4.0|This book is incredibly written, and it's hard not to appreciate its clever dialogue, interesting characters and crazy story.  The protagonist is Ignatius J. Reilly, a 30-year-old man who lives with his mother in New Orleans.  Ignatius basically wastes time and takes advantage of his mother all while constantly complaining that he has been mistreated by others.  Ignatius manages to get into all sorts of complicated situations, from getting arrested to selling hot dogs to working at the Levi company.  The whole story is a fantastical masterpiece and you have to marvel at the author's creativity. <br /> <br />That said, I wasn't as engaged in this book as I thought I would be, and I think it's because it's difficult to sympathize with almost any of the characters.  They all have good qualities, but sometimes I found myself getting annoyed at their irritating foibles and habits.  It's a funny story, but when you're not invested in the people involved it's tough to care about what happens to them.
B0006399FS|1.0|I am an avid U2 collector of many years, and this album is a huge dissapointment. It looks like U2 is done pushing the envelope of the mainstream and taking us with them. You will not be inspired, suprised, interested, or moved by this album at all. I sure hope they make a lot of money so that they can come back with one of those less popular and much more interesting albums. They really need to decide if they are going to be a relevant band, or produce more retarded videos like the \\"Stuck in the Moment\\" one with the same director as Britney Spears. They should be confident enough to keep progressing like bands such as Radiohead. Sorry guys, but this will sound great on one of those poppy radio stations, but will never be worth a crap in my car. Maybe they should decide whether they want musical appreciative fans of mindless followers. Just my humble opinion.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I've heard many people bashing this movie for not being as intellegent as Asimov, and for being far more violent.  There is, however, something they are missing.  Unfortunately, cinematic and televised science fiction live in a place where \\"the one eyed man is king,\\" and quite frankly, this is usually as intellegent as it gets.  It's nothing new, but it tries, and it manages to be entertaining.  This \\"land of the blind\\" logic is also the reason the new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" is considered \\"realistic,\\" because it at least tries where other shows don't.
B00006879E|5.0|Okay so I purchased this cd back when they were getting little to hardly any airplay on the radio, and I just really got into it. Its was a hot summer day (yeah, it actually was here in Western WA) and we were putting in the pool and it just really helped with the work and heat. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are 5,10, and 11. This cd has been here and there with me. From having to drive to Oregon to pick up a friend, flight from SeaTac to NYC, in the shower, in my car, jogging, its a part of me now. Its almost like how can this cd be so cheap? It cost under $20 for good music that it took a little while to make. <br /> <br />Plus my dog likes it. I know that sounds weird, but it just makes her chill (which is not always easy with an Aussie.) <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|this band is terrible and has never done anything remotely good. now they are hailed as saviors of rock (see recent Entertainment Weekly cover). How an entire album of generic power-chords and limp lyrics can be considered good is beyond me. Someone gave this to me, who mistakenly bought it thinking it may be good, and called it \\"crap\\". I listened to it, laughed,  then put the CD in my local Hollywood Video night deposit box. I hope someone else can enjoy this utter waste of plastic.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This cd is Jack's finest to date. He has a new cd coming out March 1, 2005. Still if you do not have this album, but it first. You can listen to it from start to finish. My Grand-Parents even like his music. Its chill and fun, makes you dream about being in Hawai'i. <br /> <br />Worth the Cash!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Honesty is what has underlined everything Metallica has ever done. <br />   That's also why -in daring to be seen in a sometimes quite unflattering light- this documentary is as potent and fulfilling as it is. It keeps it real. <br />  No one needs to be even a fan of Metallica to follow the movie and get absorbed in it. Yet,being a life-long 'Tallica fan I not only managed to finally see it when it when it came to my town,but was pleasantly shocked to find out that 'Some Kind Of Monster' co-director Bruce Sinofsky was also there when I was that night back in Oct. '04 to introduce the film and hold a Q & A session after the film was over. Awesome. Just like this movie. <br />   It's a movie about being infallibly human in a superhuman thing called Metallica and living to get to the other side of it all for the positive. This movie literally takes you on a truly fulfilling journey. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates fine filmaking regardless if it's about Metallica or not or whether or not you're into Metallica or not. As I was saying,you don't need to be,but it helps to be even so. <br />  Five stars: for all sorts of moments by moreover for going with bottom-line honesty and not sugarcoating themselves. That's about as Metallica as it gets.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Jet flys high.... with this album. Its has the hits on it \\"cold hard b*tch\\", \\"rollover dj\\", \\"move on\\" ,etc. Its a good one for the shower, or the commute. Hey my mom even likes this album, so there you have it.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is to only make the person below happy. I bought the DVD today and watched it already. I had no errors whatsoever. Maybe you should get a new DVD player. People are writing about the story because that is what a review is for. When you buy a CD you do not want to have a person write about the plastic they had to take off and how frustrating it is. Again, regarding the DVD, no region code problems here, chapter problems, DVD plays fine. I think you are due for a new player. Best regards.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I get bored with music very fast, expecially with modern music. Same old worn out ballads, heavy guitar to cover up the incompetence of the songwriting and incredibly cliche avant garde imagery add up to nothing worth a listen. <br /> <br />When I first heard Audioslave however ('Show Me How to Live' was the song), I went out and bought the album. And it was well worth it. This is a piece of genuine music for music's sake. With the Linkin Parks and Evanescences of the world dominating airtime, it's easy to overlook real talent. <br /> <br />This album is catchy without being annoying, heavy without being too much, smooth without being droning - a perfect mixture. It's been about a year so far that I've listened to this album and I'm still intrigued.
0312330529|5.0|The author said this book was 11 years in the making. It was worth the wait!! A novel with a grand scope and characters who we all can learn from. Set in India, fairly exotic for many, the <br />900 plus pages clip along at a fast rate and enough changes to keep everyone hooked. There are messages about life in this book we all need to be reminded of and take to heart. Some of the writing was just breath taking. Don't miss it.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|The movie closer takes a look into the biggest problem with relationships, cheating. They follow two couples relationship in the city of London. The movie made me depressed because of all the cheating. The only funny part was the two male characters chatting online in the sex room. The biggest problem that all the characters had by the end of the movie was a lack of trust.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Aguilera came into the music field about the same time as a slew of other young teenaged female singers (Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears) and as a consequence was usually compared with them and seen as a lightweight bubblegum artist. While I'm not ready to say she'll make a major mark on musical history, I'm no longer inclined to dismiss her.<br /><br />From the opening track, Aguilera makes clear that this album is her attempt to show the \\"real her\\" and for the most part it's fairly honest in that, since she at least co-writes most of the material here. The sound is also a big departure from the past, with a lot more R&B and rock influence in the mix and language and themes that indicate (mostly) that she's not concerned with the teen market anymore.<br /><br />Best tracks include \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Beautiful\\": outstanding, shimmery tunes and obvious airplay choices. \\"Cruz\\" opens with a stunning multitracked acappella vocal from Aguilera and only falters toward the end as vocal histrionics creep in. \\"I'm OK\\" shows Aguilera baring her soul about an abusive father. While overproduced, it never becomes maudlin. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" is also a keeper.<br /><br />Low points are the Spanglish Latin lover tune \\"Infatuation\\" (which would have been best left off the 20 track CD, there's plenty of material and it brings the album down..),\\"Soar\\" is an overbaked gospelly self-help mantra, an example of the tone bordering on treacly. \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" are her \\"I'm a woman, I can have sex if I want to\\" numbers but they seem forced.<br /><br />But these are things she has a lot of time to work out, and it's quite possible that a masterpiece could be on the way from her, say 2 or 3 albums out. Here's hoping this is the future for her and not a one-time abortive experiment.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars
B00009W0U4|2.0|I love movies. Believe me. <br />And I'm not the type \\"love story & happy ending\\" reviewer. <br />I heard this movie was very raw, violent and a lot of things. And it is. But the story is poor, very poor. There's a very good performance -the main man- and nothing else. <br />The director seems to be a \\"marketing oriented one\\": all the time the images on the screen seems shout: look how bad is the human nature, look the limits, look this violence, look how raw  is this movie, guau...more violence. If you really want a disturbed movie BUT with a story, a truly director behind and without all this talent-less images, look for \\"Requiem for a dream\\": this is a movie, not like this garbage. <br />Forget about it.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is definetly the best movie version of a love story I have seen in forever! And the best part is that it was derived from the novel version. Usually one or the other is better, but in this case I would say they both exceeded my expectations. I ran straight to the store when it came out and got this movie. It would make a wonderful valentines gift, or just an everyday gift. Definetly not a disappointment!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This past weekend, I rented two movies:  \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" and \\"Troy\\".  Which one did I enjoy more?  \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\".  I laughed and sometimes, I felt like crying.  All the more touching for someone like me who actually was an adolescent and teenager during the 80s when Ninja stars, cage wrestling, large rectangular eyeglasses,  and cheesey vacation t-shirts were the rage for the nerd set. <br /> <br />I never want to see \\"Troy\\" again.  All I can remember from that movie is Brad Pitt's naked body (and I honestly don't want to remember that). . .  battle scenes were so over-the-top, they all looked alike, and I got sick of the fighting. <br /> <br />I could watch \\"Napoleon\\" over and over. . .  no cussing, no nudity.  Light-hearted on the surface, but if you think about it too much, it might get heavy.  But never boring.
0393035158|5.0|This is a brilliant book and the author had to have a lot of courage to write it. This is the author's first book. Sam Harris, the author, is now working on his doctorate in neuroscience. He has studied Eastern and Western religious traditions, along with a variety of spiritual disciplines for twenty years. Harris calls for the end of religious faith in the modern world and identifies religious beliefs as the core of many of the human atrocities throughout history. He argues that our willingness to ignore reason and scientific facts as we maintain our beliefs, not based on sound science and reason, will lead the world into more peril because these beliefs not only legitimize intolerance, but they have also invaded most aspects of political and secular life and threaten to become apocalyptic in a world with weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />The author believes that all religions are harmful, not just extremist & terrorist religions, which are obviously harmful. He sees those who practice moderate religion as a bigger part of the problem than some people think because they provide a foundation of unreason that radicals, fundamentalists and religious terrorists build upon.<br /><br />What is a belief? A belief is a powerful force that once it is internalized moves almost everything else in a person's life. Beliefs define one's vision of the world, one's behavior and one's emotional responses. Beliefs are principles of action. It is through beliefs that we predict events and consider the likely consequences of our actions and therefore guide our behavior. The power beliefs have over our emotional lives is total because for every emotion we are capable of feeling, there is a belief that evokes it.<br /><br />What is faith? The Bible defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. It seems to say that faith is entirely self-justifying. Religious faith is unjustified belief in the most important matters that we have been convinced we don't need to justify.<br /><br />The terrorists who committed the atrocities on September 11 have been described as men of profound (extremist) religious faith. There were serious reports that they expected to receive the very best rewards in heaven for their efforts. This is just one example of the dangers that we all face when persons do not base their actions on reason. Another example is the Inquisition which began in the year 1184 and continued in parts of the world until 1834. In the name of God, countless innocents were tortured and murdered for heresy. All the perpetrators of these atrocities were men of God including popes, bishops, friars and priests.<br /><br />Seeking more knowledge in our world is in a way the opposite of faith. Faith relies on unquestioned, closed mindedness. Wanting to know more about our world leaves us vulnerable to new evidence. The thing that will permit human beings to work together with open minds in making a better world is our willingness to have our beliefs modified by reasoned facts.<br /><br />What does religion offer? There is a clear difference between religious moderates and religious extremists. However, both pose a danger to reason. This is because moderates underestimate the effect that faith has had on man's inhumanity to man, and they wrongly advocate the belief that faith is an essential component of human life. There is a myth that moderation is far superior to more extremist religious faith. It is not moderate to believe in the Bible and the God of organized religion because these beliefs are not in line with reason and there is no evidence to support these beliefs.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that moderates have had to make the decision to ignore or loosely interpret the bible in order to live coherently in the modern world. Living in a world where a single world leader can annihilate millions based on faith, it must be argued that we no longer have a right to our myths.<br /><br />Spirituality,of course, is not a myth. There are degrees of human experiences of meaningfulness, selflessness, awareness and heightened emotions that go beyond our current understanding of the mind. Spirituality is the range of experiences that exceed our ordinary-everyday limits of subjectivity and include exploring new and changed emotions as well as cognitive and conceptual new awarenesses. Spirituality respects the fact healthy skepticism is important, and that skepticism does not in any way diminish spirituality.s of meaningfulness, selflessness, awareness and heightened emotions that go beyond our current understanding of the mind.

B00005JLPK|5.0|I really loved this film, I admit I'm biased, I have found Frida Khalo captivating, mysterious and interesting for years.<br /><br /> What I liked most was it's bravery in the tale telling and the avoidance of the usaul \\"Frida\\" cliches. Too often Khalo is dismissed as strange and kranky both in her relationships and her art. For me it has never been enough that the art world simply labels her as a \\"surrealist\\". Here Hayek plays Khalo as the passionate, caring, pained genius she was. The film endevours to display her agonies through accidents, infidelities, dissapointments and differences. She plays the head strong feminist and communist, a woman passionate about her nation and it's values, traditions and beliefs, a woman agonising to love her family while plow her own trough. A woman uniquely skilled in her creativity and brave enough to tell of her pain and development on canvas. Hayek is a brilliant leading lady and completely dominates the film with Frida's passion and personality, there are other strong roles, Molina and Rush are superb but they never detract from Hayek. The cinematography is delicious and the music is both appropriate and engaging. It's a shame this film didn't get a better run and better audiences. It's a joy to see Hayek get the chance to command a film and see her do it so well, in Hollywood she is too often the token latin girl.<br /><br /> The film is a real tribute to an inspirational and hugely misunderstood woman.
0307120007|3.0|My daughter (2 years old) loves this book but I will have to replace it soon because all the pages easily came out of the ringbinding (with her help of course). I have re-assembled it thousands of times but now the ring binding is strecthed out and does not want to hold the pages together. Not a book that will last through more than one child in my experience, if they make the book with a solid hard cover, I have yet to find it.
B00005JMJG|4.0|When love almost dies, we get hurt and angry and sometimes forget, that the enjoyng the good times is the other side of the coin from enduring the tough times. To give up one you give up the other. Would it be worth it? That is the premise of this imaginative film. You have to be in the right emotional place to enjoy this film.
B00005KHJV|5.0|This is my favorite movie first of all. I am a huge Halloween fan. This movie took only 3 1/2 weeks in March to make and when it opened up in October of 1978 in made about 40 million dollars. Talk about a huge profit then.<br /><br />The movie is not bloody but scary. The way the camera moves you feel like you are actually there and the music combined is very chilling too. John Carpenter did a brilliant job directing this movie. Michael Myers is Dr. Sam Loomis' patient played very well by Donald Pleasance. Dr. Loomis tries to help Michael for 7 years after he brutally stabbed one of his family members when he was only 6. But after 8 more years he sees no hope and wants to lock him up for good and will do anything to do so.  But Michael some how escapes from the mental institution and goes back home to Haddonfield.<br /><br />This is Jamie Lee Curtis first movie role and she was perfectly cast as the innocent yet spooked Laurie Strode. Michael slowly start to stalk Laurie, Linda, and Nancy after Laurie drops something off at Michael's house. You can hear his heavy breathing throughout the film and its just plain eerie.  The white mask he wears even made me more afraid. It is actually the William Shatner mask that is used in the movie.<br /><br />The movie gets really suspenseful when day turns to night and Laurie and her girfriend Nancy both have to babysit. Both houses are across from each other. The atmosphere of a dark, windy, fall night makes the movie even scarier. Michael will kill anyone that gets in his way. There are many scenes when you see Michael stalking each victim which is extremely well done with the camera usage again. I will not give the rest of it away because the movie is just so good!!! I highley recommend this if you want to get really scared!!! There is also 12 minutes of extra footage included in the movie that was used when it aired on TV. The extra footage has Donald Pleasance in some very interesting scenes that were deleted in the theatrical version. It goes more into depth as to what the real evil is that is living inside of Micheal Myers.e into depth as to what the real evil is that is living inside of Micheal Myers.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|I was disappointed like many others with the missing footage. I can live without the missing tracks.<br /><br />My main problem with this DVD is the sound quality, which is not good even for a live recording. They studio could have done better, but I get the feeling that no effort was done to ensure a quality transfer and some decent sound.

1400032717|4.0|The typical interpretation of this book seems to be that it is a window into the mind of a deviant (autistic). Those who love the book say the author amazingly gets it right, and those who hate it say the author gets it grossly wrong. <br /> <br />For me, the book is something else. It's a window through which we can view ourselves and acquire new insights into the insanity of normalcy. It employs the age-old device of the court jester, the village idiot, the witch, the invader from outer space, or some other deviant as sage or model--paralleled in nonfiction by the Tocquevillian insights of a foreigner into how our society works. So, I think treating this as a book about autists is like treating Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" as a book about pigs. <br /> <br />As such, I found the book engaging, provocative, and perceptive. A bit like my appreciation for a powerful critique of presidential nonsense. It helped me ruminate about ambiguity, humor, irony, honesty, meaning, and what is important and trivial in the universe. The rest is a plot that (suspensefully and humorously) generates incidents for processing by the interpreter. <br /> <br />My 1-star discount is for a bit of unbelievability. The protagonist seems to know so much about normals and how he deviates from them that his alleged failure to understand normals' presuppositions is somewhat unpersuasive. He knows myriad facts about distant continents and galaxial bodies and is apparently an avid reader and TV watcher, yet subways and escalators are things he has never learned of. And the story is set in the 21st century, complete with computer video games, yet interurban communications are limited to postal correspondence--no e-mail, and no telephone, even when one character is heartbroken and mystified about receiving no replies to a long sequence of letters. <br /> <br />By the way, I got the Adobe e-book version of this publication (partly to see what that would be like). It worked, but some facts seem to remain undisclosed until you have bought the item. 1. It's encrypted, and you are permitted to copy it and read it on multiple computers, but you need to register with Adobe before you can read it on each computer. 2. You can read it with Adobe Reader, but Adobe Reader cannot save your highlighting. To save highlighting, you must read it with (the non-free) Acrobat. (Same as the US IRS's fill-in PDF forms.) 3. If you want to copy an excerpt for a book report or whatever, you need to retype it (or do a screen shot and then use an OCR program), because no text is copiable. 4. The publisher hasn't permitted you to have Acrobat read the text out loud. It seems ridiculous that these facts can't be known to the buyer before the buyer decides which edition to buy, but I sure haven't found them anywhere. Maybe if enough readers wrote the publishers to ask about these questions the publishers would find it saved them money to publicize the answers.
B0006IUDXA|3.0|Okay, I love MacGyver, have for as long as I can remember. Its a great show, and this DVD release has been sooo anticipated, why could they have not used a better transfer, or added some extras? maybe some original behind the scenes work, scrapped ideas, interviews with the cast 20 years later...something! anything! I gave 3 stars because I feel this DVD set should lose one on the weak transfer, and 1 for complete lack of bonus or special features.
B00005KARK|5.0|I love this movie so much.I always cry.It's sad how they make fun of Dumbo just because of the his ears.It's sad, but great. <br />It teaches a lesson.Oh and your children are not going to care about the part when they get drunk. <br />   They would think they are dreaming or something like that.Besides Dumbo did not know there are beer  <br />in the water.Buy this.It's great!
B00008AWOG|4.0|Well after reading stunning review after stunning review a few years ago about this CD, I bought it as my first Opeth CD. The first song, \\"The Moor\\" really was a stunner. It is pure beauty/beast vocally and musically. It sounds like the theme to the movie \\"Dune\\", but with some incredible Oomph behind it...which is just outstanding. \\"The Moor\\" is an epic metal song and despite the length, doesn't get tiresome.  <br /> <br />As for the rest...whatever...it's Opeth. Am I a fan of Opeth? Sure...they have created their own little subgenre of metal. Am I always listening to Opeth? No way. I find their songs to be long and tedious normally. You've heard one Opeth song, you've heard them all - only with great craftsmanship. The older CD's are heavier, their newer stuff is lighter. Both are great, and this CD is a happy medium...perhaps the transition CD from the old to the new. <br /> <br />I would say Still Life is an \\"essential\\" CD for any metalhead.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Yes,these songs say so much. Sir Elton John has many more hits than what's contained in this collection. It would have been impossible to put them all on two CD's. Elton and Bernie Taupin have been writing songs together since 1966 but it wasn't until four years later that Elton had his first hit in America,YOUR SONG. From then on,Elton relentlessly put out hit songs year after year. The partnership between Elton and Bernie was severed for several years only to be renewed. Elton was recording on MCA for ten years before signing with the newly-christened Geffen in 1980. His tenure with Geffen caused a slump in his career until returning to MCA in 1986. He even resurrected Neil Sedaka's career in 1974 with Rocket Records,a division of MCA inspired by the 1972 hit ROCKET MAN. Elton's songs recorded on Geffen include SAD SONGS(SAY SO MUCH),I'M STILL STANDING,NIKITA and I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT THE BLUES. The latter song features a harmonica solo by R&B legend Stevie Wonder. Of the six albums recorded on Geffen,the only megahit was TOO LOW FOR ZERO,released in 1983. That album featured ISS and IGTWTCITB. Other memorable hits include CANDLE IN THE WIND,BENNIE AND THE JETS,DON'T GO BREAKING MY HEART(with Kiki Dee) and LITTLE JEANNIE. Those are all MCA hits. The latter comes from 1980's 21 AT 33,Elton's last pre-Geffen album. Elton is what Billy Joel is in America. A \\"piano man\\". They both are two of pop/rock's biggest selling artists of all-time. They both did two Face To Face tours in 1994 and 2002,respectively. Before this album,there were several other Elton John compilations including three GREATEST HITS albums,GREATEST HITS 1976-1986 released in '92 and LOVE SONGS,released in '96. Elton did make another label shift in 1995 from MCA to Island. Island albums include '95's MADE IN ENGLAND and '97's THE BIG PICTURE. Elton shifted again to,this time to Universal in 2001. Albums from the Universal era include '01's SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST and '04's PEACHTREE ROAD.Elton contemplated retirement from rock 'n roll in 2001 and made a surprise comeback when recording PR. This is the ultimate collection for every Elton John fan. Many people who own this album also have Joel's GREATEST HITS VOLUMES 1,2 and 3. Also this album was never available in the plastic jewel case,just in a cardboard gatefold case. All the other songs on this album are excellent.
B00042YC7Q|5.0|This is a fantastic CD - well worth a listen for everyone whether or not you speak Spanish. Bebe's voice is enchanting but her lyrics are fierce, especially when dealing with social issues in Spain, like wife-beating. Her music is the perfect mix of traditional Spanish guitar with more modern sounds.
B000001DQI|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine rated this album one of the 1970's' best. In 1970 British-born Elton John burst onto the American scene with YOUR SONG. This album was Elton's first #1. Hits from this album include the title track,CANDLE IN THE WIND,BENNIE AND THE JETS(recorded live),HARMONY and SATURDAY NIGHT'S ALRIGHT FOR FIGHTING. CITW is an ode to Hollywood great Marilyn Monroe who fatally overdosed on medication over a decade before the song was written and recorded. Two subsequent versions of CITW became hits also. A live version from LIVE IN AUSTRALIA which was recorded in 1986 and eleven years later,an ode to Princess Diana of Wales who was killed in a car crash. The Princess Diana tribute was entitled CANDLE IN THE WIND '97 or GOODBYE ENGLAND'S ROSE. Some of this album's hits appeared on the 1974 GREATEST HITS compilation. Great album!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|For all the sane music lover people out there, please do not listen to the Michael Jackson bashers here, calling him child molester, freak, etc. All of those knuckle heads are just STUPID and frankly don't have nothing better to do than to bash a man who's lived a life they only wish they could live. THis is a good box set. So if you're a true Michael Jackson fan it's his best!! Trust me!! If you're not hopefully you can appreciate good music and give it a shot..Again for all the Michael Jackson Bashers get a life. I'm positive the \\"Knuckleheads\\", on here Michael Jackson bashing are the main weirdo's that need to boost themselves up by making unknown comments about a man they've never even met. It's tired haters. Stop hating. Your time is up!!

B0006IIPIK|2.0|After hearing all of the anticipation and actually accepting the hype that surrounding the release of this movie to the theatres during the autumn of 2004, I could never get a chance to actually see it on the big screen and thus the movie passed me by for a long afterwards until I rented it on DVD. As painful as it is, I have to be honest with my opinion of \\"Sky Captain\\". This movie is completely disappointing in my book. I might not get a lot of support with my review but I stand my ground on this. This is certainly far from being the worst movie by any means so at least try not to view this review as smashing this movie to bits.<br /><br /> \\"Sky Captain\\" is lacking in good storyline and the entire movie meanders in so many directions that it ends up being confusing and hard to enjoy because of this (\\"Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions\\" suffers similarly but far less so). The the giant robots are outright ridiculous and almost made me laugh at the way they looked more like something that combined the cartoonish quality of \\"Inspector Gadget\\" (a great cartoon series) and some kind of Tomb Raiderish CGI figures. I could understand very much the idea focusing this during the end of the 1930s and early 1940s and such but a lot of the technology and many machines almost make it look like 2050 or 2105 (100 years after writing this review) yet somehow aircraft and other obsolete technology is transported through a time machine and dropped off in the far future. That's what this movie feels more like as opposed to a World War II era storyline.<br /><br /> The movie was indeed shot combing live action footage of the cast with all-CGI backgrounds and that is a very interesting new technique. I'm sorry but upon hearing how the special effects were `groundbreaking' I have to disagree with this. Some of the CGI effects are actually very good and are breathtaking in their visual appeal but for the most part, the special effects are actually quite blurry and make the movie difficult to watch. This is one of the things that killed this movie for me. I am all for CGI-effects even if they do get overblown but SKATWOT's special effects are just so overdone, so overproduced, to the point that it saps the quality out of it. The special effects in \\"Lord of The Rings\\" and even the Matrix trilogy (including the 1999 original) were far superior to the EFX in \\"Sky Caption\\". I did not see much of anything that looked revolutionary or groundbreaking in this movie. What could've been groundbreaking instead comes off as overdone and a grand waste of opportunity.<br /><br /> I'm not saying avoid this movie like the plague necessarily but do not expect anything out of the ordinary on this movie. A bitter and crushing disappointment to say the least, you're better off just passing this by.is is one of the things that killed this movie for me.

B0006Z2KIY|5.0|Ge the klenex ready!  This movie was the most amazing love story I have ever seen.  It will make every man and woman cry.  It portrays a beautiful ove story that most people dream of.  It will be one of the classics some day.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I love Will Ferrell, Steve Carrell and all of the others in this movie.  These are people who can be funny just standing around.  On top of it all, it sounded like a great premise with plenty of opportunity for big laughs.  Unfortunately, this movie produced no more than 3 mild chuckles from me.  We watched every minute of the movie, including the bloopers just hoping for one actual laugh ... only to be completely denied. I am not a difficult person to please when it comes to comedy and I have to say it was the worst movie I have ever seen.  DO NOT waste your money on buying this movie.  If you insist on seeing it for yourself rent it or borrow it from a friend, but you will regret spending money on it.
B00062RCBW|5.0|I used to watch this show with my dad and younger sister all the time. I recently was talking about this series with a friend who used to watch it with HIS family too. We both agreed that this series was one of the best, and how nice it would be to have them all on DVD to share with OUR families.<br /><br />Obviously, our wish was granted. Too bad this is no longer available in stores.<br /><br />From season one, Start Trek, the Next Generation was exciting and interesting. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is the captain of the Starship Enterprise, including a large crew that in later seasons includes Whoopi Goldberg, Brent Spinner, Levar Burton and others.<br /><br />Watching this show is engaging and interesting because the show takes place in the furture where there are alien races of all sorts and intergalactic wars between cultures and new planets to explore. How lucky the characters are in the show to explore the universe and discover new races of people! They also have better technology, such as the Hollodeck-a deck of the ship that creates holograms in 3-d form. Its like an elaborate dress up room in ANY time and or place.<br /><br />The episodes are engaging throughout, but many are unforgettable, such as \\"The Child\\" Where Dianna Troi becomes pregnant by an alien entity and the child goes from being an infant to an 8 year old in one day, and \\"Elementary, dear Data\\" where Data plays a Sherlock Holmes mystery on the Holodeck. Another interesting episode from season 3 is called \\"Hollow Persuits\\" in which one of the crew members uses the Holodeck to act out his fantasies about the crew, including having Troi seduce him, and having a swordfight against Data, and Captain Picard!<br /><br />I would reccomend getting this series in ANY way you can, its worth the VERY high $$. Sure its on TNG now, but someday it won't be on TV anymore, and you'll own all the episodes on DVD, to watch over and over again.<br /><br />This 48 disc set is well done and spans the many years that the crew of the Starship Enterprise worked together.pans the many years that the crew of the Starship Enterprise worked together. <br /> <br />
B0002234LS|3.0|Johnny Depp (Ed Wood, Pirates Of The Carribean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl) plays Mort Rainey to the till. This movie is based on Stephen King's story. Depp is a retired writer and who is also divorced from Maria Bello (Coyote Ugly, Tv's ER) who is seeing Timothy Hutton (The Dark Half, Beautiful Girls). At the beginning Depp finds them in the hotel. A stranger called Shooter played with real southern brass by John Tuturro (The Man Who Cried, Rounders) comes and tells Rainey he stold his story. Rainey doesnt believe him till he kills his dog. It goes on and it's serious this time and things happen and the end is just great. It has its moments Depp brings yet again another chacter to his bag of fun. Highlight would be of course Depp's secret at the end. I dont see why he had to have the braces. Charles S. Dutton (Mimic, Against The Ropes) also stars. Dutton also starred in Nick Of Time with Depp back in '95, so their old buddies. This will add good to my collection. Check it out Depp fans
B000002J27|5.0|It may be heresy to some progressive rock fans, but the Phil Collins era of Genesis actually got off to a great start with A Trick of the Tail, in my opinion.  Anyone born after 1970 might find this impossible to believe, but today's Grammy-grabbing Disney-fied schlockmeister actually used to be very cool.  I swear I'm not making this up!  Concurrent to his excellent drumming and later vocal work with serious symphonic proggers  Genesis, Collins played in serious fusioners Brand X, and was in demand by people like Brian Eno for his services.  And while I rate most of the Peter  Gabriel-led albums higher, this one is still a great big slab of prime 70's prog and it's entertaining as hell.  The brilliant re-use of themes ties the whole thing together in that classic prog way, with some of the band's strongest melodies ever.<br /><br />Replacing a singer of Peter Gabriel's calibre was practically a thankless task but Collins held things together through this album and Wind and Wuthering, and then especially on the live album Seconds Out, his all-time career peak in my opinion.  Then it all went horribly wrong, but that's another story.  Some prog-oriented reviewers like to slag \\"Ripples\\" and \\"Entangled\\" but those tracks are quite proggy if you listen past the pretty melodies.  The opener \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" is a classic and every bit as good as any of the Gabriel era stuff.  \\"Los Endos\\" is one of the all-time great Prog finales and remained the band's concert closer for many years (I remember seeing them live with the 747 landing lights from the Second's Out cover recreated on stage during \\"Los Endos.\\"  Legendary and Awesome.)<br /><br />Earlier I called this record a great big slab and I meant that literally.  Genesis packed an almost impossible amount of music onto those old vinyl LP's, which makes nearly all their 70's reissues tailor made for the CD age, as well as a good value for the consumer.<br /><br />Great songs, great melodies, great performances, much better production than they usually got back then:  it all adds up to 5 stars.usually got back then:  it all adds up to 5 stars.
B0000V46Q8|5.0|George Clooney (Oceans 11 and 12, From Dusk Till Dawn) brings you into the life of Chris Kelvin who ventures up to a space station called Solaris where he finds that there are only two people left on the ship and the rest of the crew has vanished, so he interrogates the 2 to find out what happened and also in the process he starts to see his dead wife, Natascha McElhone (Laurel Canyon, Truman Show) and then he finds out the real truth of what happened on that ship. A powerfully hypnotic and tense movie with Clooney at the top of his game giving one of his best performances and McElhone has never been more beautiful.

068987474X|4.0|The number of times I have felt the need to bang my head against the wall while listening to one of my girlfriends lament that she \\"can't understand\\" this guy she likes are uncountable.  Women have conditioned themselves to make excuses for guys and fall over themselves to make themselves \\"better\\" for their perceived love interest.  It's nice to see a book that says, don't bother.  Behrendt is refreshing and honest (isn't that how we want our men to be?) and explains that not only are some guys not interested, but it doesn't matter because if you stop fretting over the ones that aren't you'll find the one who is.  Now instead of having to try to shake some sense into my friends, I can hand them this book and say \\"don't talk to me about your problems with so-and-so until you finish reading this.\\"  Of course, then if that doesn't work, I could throw the book at them and KNOCK some sense into them...
B00001PE4D|3.0|This Americanized version of Dangerous Liasons aimed at the teen crowd is surprisingly funny and enjoyable for about two thirds of it's running time.  Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar are perfectly cast as rich manipulative step-siblings who enjoy ruining people's lives, which for the first half of the film makes it worth watching.  The two place a bet when a down to earth virgin (Reese Witherspoon) comes into the picture, and Sebastien (Phillipe), naturally, falls for her.  Director/screenwriter Roger Kumble keeps Cruel Intentions rolling along thanks to the antics of Phillipe and Gellar, with Gellar looking the most seductive she's ever looked.  However, when Cruel Intentions turns into a by the numbers sappy love story with a just plain lame ending, it almost ruins the film.  That aside, the first two thirds of Cruel Intentions is great fun, especially in sub-plots involving other characters (Selma Blair and Eric Mabius), but it's promise is betrayed by it's final acts.  Cruel Intentions can't hold a candle to Dangerous Liasons, which is a much better recommendation than this, but if you're looking for a cheap laugh and thrill, this is worth renting.
0375507256|5.0|i hesitated before buying this book feeling it looked rather intellectual and 'experimental' . How could a story that starts in the the mid nineteenth century and finishes there via 1930's Belgium, 1970's LA ,  1980's Britain , a Korean superstate of the near future and the end of history itself. be coherent ? How could a novel with 6 very distinct narrators and with six apparently different stories  possibly not lose the plot ? (excuse the pun )<br /><br />Well what seemed like a gimmick turns out to be incredibly compelling and entertaining . Entertaining is not a word you'd expect to be associated with any work fiction that plays with form so much (ulysees is hardly a barrel of laughs ) but mitchell pulls it  off because he has a sense of humor, as well as a good old fashioned sense of what makes a good story .Each of the tales that make up Cloud Atlas is great in it's own right  and each has it's own mood - from very funny to heartbreaking  to terrifying. In a way part of what cloud atlas is about is what is a story and why are tales so important to our culture and in the end, what happens when we start to lose language and history itself ? Isn't that in the end what the 'end of history' means ?<br /><br />Mitchell has been compared to Murakami  but  to me having lived in asia like mitchell , he is far more european in his storytelling (indeed he pastiches several genres during the course of the book , from literary fiction through science fiction).<br /><br />Once again the Man Booker Prize jury proved just what useless bunch they are by denying it victory . It's quite clearly not only the best book of the year, but one of the top 10 books in the English language in the last five years. The word classic is bandied about like so much confetti these days but cloud atlas could well turn out to be exactly that.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars has finally made it's way onto DVD, and the picture and sound have been cleaned up, and look and sound fantastic.  I will not get into the differences, as the Amazon reviewer already has in detail, but at the end of the day, they really aren't that different, when you watch them as a whole, and not just the particular scene isolated.  Most of the changes do not take up much screentime, and the overall feel of the saga is still the same.  The purists may want to hesitate, since Lucas has stated that he will release the older versions on DVD when VHS becomes obsolete, so don't start screaming yet! <br /> <br />The special features are great too, although I'm hoping for an even bigger set to come out in 2007 (30th anniversary).
0375805621|1.0|As a child I read \\"Monster at the End of the Book\\" and loved it.  My question is why did they have to write pretty much the same story and add Elmo.  Must he poke his little red head into every aspect of Seasame Street there is.  The story lost some of its suspence when he was added.  The children in my class when I read the first book they were the ones pushing Grover through the story.  In this one Elmo is pushing Grover along and not the children.  If you are looking for a great book for your children pick the first one and leave Elmo out.   <br /> <br />P.S I have read this with Early Childhood classrooms and Special Education.
B000002KON|5.0|If you're going to buy one Kinks album, make it this one. Ray Davies wit is at full force and not a lyric is wasted in this masterpiece. Many of the songs are visciously anti-war (and I'm sure there will be plenty who will find relevance for today). Best songs are Victoria, Yes Sir No Sir, Some Mother's Son, Shangri-La, Nothing to Say, and Arthur. A very rock n roll, very clever, very british, and very easy album to get addicted to.

B00005JN0T|3.0|This film intrigued me because of the interesting premise about a robot accused of murder, which is something it supposedly cannot do.  That's because there are three laws that govern the internal programming of robots...one being that they cannot kill a human being, that their job is to protect human life.  So, the film hooks you by an intriguing premise then reels you in until they pull a switch on you (that old \\"bait and switch\\" standby) and the film leads elsewhere, and that's where it falls apart. <br /> <br />The first half of the movie is well done and quite intriguing.  Will Smith as Detective Spooner is investigating a strange death of the creator of these robots.  The dead man happened to have fallen out of a window, so everyone thinks its suicide.  Spooner suspects otherwise, because he has a history of hating robots.  Everyone else \\"knows\\" that there's no way a robot could commit murder because of the three operating principles.  So, we get an interesting storyline in which the robot is apprehended and interrogated.  The film has the look and feel of another film set in the future (Spielberg's \\"Minority Report\\").  In fact, to watch both films as a double feature would convince you that they take place in the same time period and place as one another.  I liked that about this film (because I'm a huge fan of \\"Minority Report\\"). <br /> <br />Once the twist happens, the film goes into a different tangent and it all goes downhill from there.  Its a gimmick that I'm growing tired of...the old switcheroo.  Movie audiences are so sophiscated these days that Hollywood seems like they have to continually pull fast ones on moviegoers by making unexpected twists in the story just to throw people off from predicting the ending.  But by the end of this movie, who really cared?  The trailers sold it as one thing, the film resolves to something else entirely, and I couldn't help but feel ripped off and cheated.  This film wasn't so much a murder mystery, exploring the paradox of the three rules in regards to how a robot could commit murder, as it is a cautionary tale about the militarization of the country as it moves towards totalitarianism by use of artificial intelligence to do the dirty deed of preventing people from rising up against the corporate takeover of our government.  If that's what the film was about, they should have sold it as such, but don't string people along thinking its about a robot accused of murder, making it look guilty, then pulling a switcheroo to where the robot is actually a savior.  Lame.  I expected much better.  See \\"Minority Report\\" instead.  Its a more profound film.
0380729407|3.0|I thought the book was very interesting and in fact suspenseful in every way. You never knew what to expect. Will and Jim were two young boys with dreams and hopes like every other boy. They never expected something wicked coming for them. I personally enjoyed the book and think the movie was great as well. The movie and the novel compare and contrast in many different ways. I rate this novel a 3 becuase it is in the mid-point of a great novel. I couldn't relate to it so that's why I didn't rate it a 4. But it is an excellent book to read. When I first read the book I was very confuse about the direction it was going, but in the end it all ties up and connects to each personal character.
0553573403|5.0|Honestly, I think I've identified those readers that may not like this series. If you're exclusively into adventure fantasy or those stories where heavy emphasis is set on the bad guy getting his while the good guy prevails, then you might not like A Song of Ice and Fire. If you're a fantasy action buff, and must read about characters getting their asses handed to them or killed in virtually every chapter, then this series might not be for you.<br /><br />There's fighting in these books. There's conflict and war. But all of it is precipitated by clever, underhanded, and somewhat complicated family and courtroom politics. In a Song of Ice and Fire - and unlike some other fantasy novels - war isn't provoked by a mad man's irrational desire for global conquest and potential heroes aren't molded as a result of this.<br /><br />There are no great, flashy heroes or fantastic villains. What you have are gray pieces set on one big game board; pieces that move in subtle fashion according to the whims of their masters and conspirators. These moves are planned surreptitiously, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next. That's one of the reasons why some people may find the books to be boring --- because the schemes orchestrated by the characters in the book intentionally leave their reader's, as well as the other characters in the story, in the dark until it's almost too late. If you want to read a book where you know everything that's going to happen next, where you can pat yourself on the back for being able to understand/realize examples of cunning that any 12-year-old can decipher beforehand, then skip this series.<br /><br />If you want to appreciate true levels of canniness, subtlety, and wit that would make any drow of Menzoberranzan blush, then pick these books up.

I read some reviews about some of the guitar work being out of tune, but I don't or haven't heard this on the cd.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I finally bought Gavin DeGraw's CD, \\"Chariot\\", with the bonus disc \\"Stripped\\".  I must say that the original is lacking, it's over-produced.  Needless to say, I was about to kick myself until I put in \\"Stripped\\".  This CD is AWESOME.  This album really shows is range as a singer - songwriter, guitarist, pianist, everything.  It also showcases better arrangements of his songs than what's on the original. I put this CD in the same group as Lauryn Hill's, \\"This Mis-Education of Lauryn Hill\\" - it's a great disc that can be listened to from beginning to end and you KEEP listening to it.  So, ladies and gentlemen, get this CD! Gavin DeGraw is amazing!!!!
0380729407|3.0|Something wicked did happen to Will and Jim. Two close friends about the same age wonder around and found something that changed both of their lifes. The carousel they saw by wondering around was a time machine. Both were present to see how the time machine works. They saw how the carousel took many weird people back in time according to their desires. A big disaster was the conclusion of their wondering, they were chased and tempted for looking at people and things they werent suppose to be seen.
B00064MW6A|3.0|I had bad expectations of this film after hearing last summer how widely panned it was and based on the trailer, which didn't really make this film a \\"must see\\" for me.  I'm glad I waited, though it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, and it could stand to be a lot better. <br /> <br />First of all, choosing Halle Berry for the latest incarnation of Catwoman was the best decision the producers could make.  She makes a perfect Catwoman and does a great job.  Her costume is better than the one Michelle Pfeiffer used in \\"Batman Returns\\", though I still didn't like her mask.  Halle Berry is the best thing about this movie, especially with her whip appeal and sexy moves.  One scene I like in particular is the basketball game between Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) and Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), with the hip urban groove music matching the flow and rhythm of the game, which is more a physical flirtation between the two than an actual game.  This occurs when Patience is just learning about her new dexterous style. <br /> <br />Now, for the bad...which is nearly everything else about the film.  The plot is flimsy and reminiscent of the first Tim Burton \\"Batman\\" film...cosmetics that does more harm and requires continuous use to prevent the scars on one's face.  Patience Phillips is a mousy commercial artist who is so timid and afraid of the boss (played by Lambert Wilson, best known as the Merovingian of the two \\"Matrix\\" sequels and essentially plays the same role in this film) that she takes his abuse and scorn.  Sharon Stone plays the wife of Monsieur Hedere, who's every bit as schemeing as her husband, though a bit more deadly.  This leads to the inevitable \\"cat fights\\" between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone. <br /> <br />Someone complained about Patience Phillips being a mousy lady, but that's the point, at least with Selena Kyle (the original alter-ego of Catwoman).  The transformation of a mousy lady into a fierce, feline, femme fatale is the whole point aboutCatwoman and the empowerment of such a role.  That's why Patience is \\"mousy\\" at first.  What bothered me most about this film is Patience's sidekick, a white co-worker who practically pushes Patience on a date with Detective Tom Lone, and who wants the scoop on every little detail.  It was especially a cringe-worthy moment to hear this plumpy, dumpy white woman tell Patience, \\"give me my props!\\" and trying to act hip and cool.  It totally rang false.  The whole friendship between the two of them didn't see authentic, but was a mere contrivance to give Patience a friend that plays a semi-important role for the purposes of dialogue.  Now about that dialogue...very cliched and cheesy (such as Catwoman grabbing hold of a baddie's tongue and then saying, \\"cat got your tongue?\\").  The film is full of horrendous dialogue. <br /> <br />Another complaint about the film is that too many scenes took place in industrial buildings.  It was just unoriginal and not very exciting.  It lends a sort of \\"been there, done that, seen that\\" blase to the whole film.  There's really nothing in here that screams to be seen, that just wows you the way the two \\"Spider-man\\" films do.  That movie has heart, this one doesn't.  My final critique is that the background music was often annoyingly distracting and didn't fit the scene (except for the basketball one-on-one game).  The people who made this film either tried to hard or didn't try hard enough...its not very original, exciting, or worth the money and time spent on it.  Halle Berry as Catwoman is the only good thing about this film and she makes it worth watching at least once.  Take her out of the equation and the film is third-rate, first draft stuff that should never have been given the greenlight.  Because this film bombed, there's little chance that a better made sequel will ever get made, which is a shame.  There's so many things one can do with a Catwoman film, but this film isn't it.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I feel so blessed to be able to enjoy  The Pat Metheny Groups music. In the 20  plus years I've been listening to these guys, their music rarely seems to miss  \\"hittin' me where I live!\\"  In a recent interview, Pat Metheny  made some reference   to composing melodies his fans can hum to.  And that's exactly what I have always  done to San Lorenzo, The Epic, Airstream, Everyday I Thank You,  etc. Looking at the   reviews on Amazon, there are many music lovers who are sooo passionate about this   band's work and as am I. There's alot of diverse musicality on \\"The Way Up.\\" Lots of   mystery, dramatic touches, quiet reflection. It really is a puzzle.  I don't know if I'll ever  be able to put any of these pieces together. I guess that's part of the fun of it. Lastly,  I just want to say how I always also enjoy the Artwork choices for the cd covers for the   group. The central focus is always on the music and the photography and collages   always seem to add some depth to the whole package. To all my fellow man who love this music,   Cheers and may peace be with you!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This cd is a dream come true for every real guy out there. If you have trouble picking up women(and compared to me you do, trust me on that one), you can throw in this cd and even girls that shower will want to go out with you. I LOVE Josh Gargon!!!! He is soulful, but not pregnant and just sings song after song of headsplitting metal until you think Metallica is a bunch of toddlers playing with stuffed animals. I am totally mad at the cover because they cut half of his awesome head off. His head is AWESOME!!!!! It's covered with Screech hair and is not mangy. This cat can turn a party out. If he collaborated with Lil Jon, we would have music that would finally rival the Beatles. Josh Gorban is COOL!!!!! If you don't get this you'll probably get a bad rash on your feet that will feel like athletes foot, but won't actually be athletes foot. It will be GARBONS FOOT!!! You foot will smell like a pile of sewage and people will not like you. So get this and don't be a total bob Saget.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|The review is for the new Matrix Box set.<br />With the Matrix series we have an original and most enjoyable concept in the science fiction genre.<br />The first movie was a total smash(and rightly so) at the box office.It's special effects were quite revolutionary and many films  have copied them and its' style vigorously since then.<br />The second movie went down from the first one due to a bit of a shaky plot which resulted ultimately in a two parter which led into the third and last of the series which although more satisfying than the second still couldn't quite reach the dizzying heights of the first one (it's admittedly hard to top something as spectacular as that-a very hard act to follow indeed!).<br />This set  contains more material than the passing Matrix fan could ever want and enough to satisfy even the most rabid fan.<br />The set also contains a disc(The Animatrix) which is strictly animated shorts and either give a different perspective on the series and/or fill in gaps in the movie story lines,the latter of which I found to be most helpful in rounding everything out.<br />In conclusion if you like Sci Fi and want something original,exciting and as entertaining as anything released in quite a while then I highly recommend this series and box set for you.You won't be disappointed.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Shame on you dmine45 \\"dmine45\\". You knew your post was just [...], so you didnt even dare to put your name. Shame on you, sissie. Give me a break, dumb child. You dont know anything about music. Just ask any musician which album is better... youll feel like a stupid, as you are, anyway.     Pop is the last truly rebirth of U2, in case you dont know, silly fan. Unlike the sellout U2 2000 you love, this U2 were a complete surprise and reinvention. You simply cant say the same about the lame iPod band you die for.     Pop is touching, hurtful, profound, rhythmic, heartening, urban, daring, timeless and precious. Your U2 2000 are just a greedy sellout corporation that live just because of their 80s and 90s.    Unlike your crappy ATYCLB and HTDAAB, Pop really stands out. This is an album - an experience - that pushes the limits of musical reinvention.    ...dmine45 \\"dmine45\\" Go and sing Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah along with your lovely sellout iPod singer...
B00005JN4O|4.0|I am not a Johnny Depp fan. Actually I don't like him at all as an actor or as a person. However, I am not blind to his obvious talent and in this movie, Finding Neverland, I found Depp's performance to be quite excellent. I spend most of the movie waiting for him to give one of his \\"quirky\\" performance that would make a mockery of the character he was playing but much to my surprised, Depp managed to remain true to form of a proper Edwardian gentleman. The movie rest much on Depp's and his relationship with the boys. I am happy to report that there seem to be excellent chemistry between the two sides which really made this movie enchanting. Kate Winslet plays the mother of the boys and her role remains somewhat limited as her relationship with Depp remains very platonic.<br /><br />The movie proves to be very well crafted, produced and there is a nice script to go with it. Thanks to the word \\"inspired\\" instead of \\"based\\" on real events, the movie can take liberty to the real story and make it work Hollywood style. Depp was well supported by his fellow cast members including Dustin Hoffman who ironically plays Barrie's producer.<br /><br />Story of how Barrie wrote Peter Pan and how he got his inspiration from the boys remains the central theme to this movie. Its entertaining, fun and heart-warming performances by all players do make this movie a quality film to see for almost anyone.<br /><br />I spotted only two major weaknesses in this film. First was the ending, it looked like they borrowed it completely from the Anthony Hopkins' movie, Shadowland, even down the last scene where man and boy having a good cry on the bench. Second was that we never got to know the man, J.M. Barrie, even fictionally. The movie seem to be about how Peter Pan was written up, not about the man who wrote it.<br /><br />But overall, an excellent and fun movie to watch. Its almost sad to note that in real life, the some of the boys had a short tragic life (one drown in Oxford, one got killed in World War I and other - Peter - committed suicide in 1960).e got killed in World War I and other - Peter - committed suicide in 1960).
0142004235|5.0|This is a true classic in every sense of the word. My book club read it a few years ago (before Oprah announced it as her pick). This is a must read for everybody. To me, it is about how decieving people can be, and how many people seem to be born good or evil. The story is absolutely riveting. I never read ahead in my book club, as we meet every week and agree on a certain stopping place, but I just could not put it down, and finished the entire book in a few days.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I was a little scared to buy Peter Cincinnati's cd because frankly I didn't know if I could handle the intensity. J abs and Burns have been listening to this guy and going to his wild concerts for 7 years now going back to his jr. high days before he started recording. They told me the shows were like an angry circus being put on by people from the old country. It's a rootin tootin biscuit bake that is nothing like Toby Keith at all, which is very saddening to me. I wish all music sounded like Toby Keith because he is a true artist with deep feelings. Manicotti is like a gopher that got into smoking crack. He is 200 mph with an attitude that says, \\"I Pete Chipotle and you aren't anywhere near ready for what I'm about to drop.\\". He's right, I wasn't. After hearing the first four songs from this disc, I hid in my toybox for 8 hours. You'd probably like it though.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This film is a must-see for those who have power over war and peace. Think about it - the peace treaty is about to be torpedoed by high ranking officers of both the Klingon Empire and the Federation, who stand to lose big time if peace ever breaks out. <br /> <br />Is there any similarity to the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Looks like it... Especially since, every single time there is a chance for peace, some new attack on the part of anyone over there derails whatever progress is made. Almost seems like the rogue Federation and Klingon officers of this film. But I digress... <br /> <br />This picture is a huge credit to the filmakers of the Star Trek saga, just when it was most needed (after the disaster that was Star Trek V). If you are interested in serious science fiction, toelrance between cultures or are in the mood for a good thriller, watch this one. If you live in the Middle East, by all means watch this one!
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Buble is a gifted guy with a great style and incredible vocal intstrument.  This is a well produced CD (great orchestrations and arrangements!), but is obviously aimed specifically at his fan base.  Inside the CD case are ads for joining his fan club and buying related merchandise.<br /><br />Less obvious is the ecclectic mix of song selections.  Buble has come to be known as a modern-day Sinatra in the style of, say, Harry Connick Jr.  So some of the non-standards seem a bit incongruous to a casual admirer such as myself, but are enjoyable nonetheless.  This CD, however, is best appreciated by the die-hard Buble fans.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|people who dont like this album probably dont like queens of the stone age, which means u suck. josh homme's side band doesnt sound like anyone else and it is meant to be listened to when ur on drugs. (dont do drugs kids)Jesse hughes is great live and very entertaining, so buy this mofo.
0312997221|5.0|If I were to ever become a writer, I would pattern my style after Frederick Forsyth.  He never fails to keep me glued to the pages with the way he develops the characters in such a way that we care about them and root for them.  I've yet to find a writer who can pack a story with a sense of adventure, intrigue and suspence like he can.  At the same time, the story is believeable.  There's no proof that the events which unfolded in this story did not happen; none of it is far-fetched.    The story revolves around the search for a Serbian fugitive who was responsible for the torture and death of an American aid worker.  Due to the dangerous nature of this job, a specialist must be called in.  This specialist is Cal Dexter who was a tunnel rat in Vietnam.  Cal's mission is to capture the fugitive and then bring him to justice, but there is someone in the FBI who doesn't want this to happen.  Ironically, the capture of the fugitive can have diasterous ramifications.
B000007MVM|5.0|Listening to this its clear that Waters took what he heard Syd doing and constructed the next ten years of Pink Floyd with it. Barrett was the embryo of the Pink Floyd phenomenon. I love Waters' Floyd as well, but I know when I'm listening to the origin of that sound, and this is it. Barrett was a brilliant yet unstable anomaly, the heart-seed atom of a vision that Waters would subsequently nuture into full fruition.
0790729342|5.0|This movie, the second in the Mad Max trilogy, is easily the best of the three.  Visually, it's very distinctive.  The first movie showed a society breaking down in the post apocalyptic world.  By this movie, it's broken down.  The first movie showed the immediate aftermath.  There were still working phones, power lines, people trying to go on with their normal lives, etc.  There was even a police force, of which Max was a member, trying to maintain order.  Now, society has descended into complete anarchy.  Civilization's infrastructure has broken down completely.  In the first movie you saw shops, service stations, hospitals.  Now you see people scavenging in a wrecked world.  Max's car is no longer a gleaming black vehicle, but a delapidated, dirty old beater, its engine still in top shape, but its interior stripped, and its body covered in dust, battered and old.  Max's leather police uniform is no longer immaculate, but torn and patched.  Visually, this movie set a new standard, and like \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\", changed the way movies in its genre were made.  Even the setting works in telling the story.  Where the first film featured country with trees and green grass, this movie is set in a blasted desert, further accentuating the sense of collapse.<br /><br />And this movie's quality doesn't end with the visuals.  It has a great, exciting story, very reminiscent of the pulp adventures of old.  It's hero, a wanderer, a uniquely skilled and deadly loner, is a mythic archetype.  The actors are all perfectly cast.  Mel Gibson, with only a few lines of dialogue, turns in a compelling, emotional performance, showing the transformation from the happy, loving husband and father of the first film, to the wounded, burnt out shell of a man seen here.  In this film, Max is a tough, fang-scarred old wolf, who has absolutely nothing to live for, but whose survival instinct, combined with his toughness and resourcefulness, just won't let him quit.<br /><br />The other characters in this movie are also unique and memorable.  Bruce Spence's gyro captain is a likeable opportunist.  Mike Preston's Papagallo is the determined, idealistic leader, in over his head, but trying his best.  Vernon Wells makes a great, flamboyant villain.  And Kjell Nilsson is the Humungus, whose face we never see; leader of a vicious band of trash, whose hulking physique, and savage followers seem at odds with his articulate speech, and ostensibly conciliatory manner.  The story and characters elevate this movie over the host of low budget imitators that followed.  But the film is not short on action either.  And George Miller was a gifted director who put to film what remain the best car chase scenes ever shot, right down to this day.  Action lovers will find plenty of excitement with this movie.  It's a terrible shame the third film wasn't very good, as it killed the prospects of a long running series.  This is sad because Max, wandering lone wolf that he is, is a character who, like James Bond, Sherlock Holmes, or the Conan of the old pulp magazines is eminently suitable to a series of adventures.ther characters in this movie are also unique and memorable.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|Smooth as single malt Scotch and cool as ice from a clear mountain stream. Every song on this CD is lyrically beguiling and musically perfect. The arrangements? Sublime. Madeleine's vocals? O-la-la! If you don't appreciate \\"Careless Love,\\" you've probably never had a heart. Or ears.
B00074CBMY|3.0|There are very few artists that really have made such a statement upon making songs their own all the time, that it sometimes can actually backfire on a artist for that work. It has happened with Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, and now it has happened to the king of covers, Joe Cocker. Since his career started, he has always found delightful ways to make cover songs his own. From You Are So Beautiful, to his recent cover of INXS's Never Tear Us Apart, he has made a grwat statement of covers. Unfortunately for his latest work, that just actually doesn't fit the bill.<br /><br />Heart & Soul, Joe Cocker's forst release since the well-recieved 2002 independent record Respect Yourself, shows what Joe has always done as a staple on his records, and that is covers. The album is a mixed bag of good and bad covers. His good covers include good remakes of U2's One, an Aretha Franklin's classic Chain Of Fools. Yet, the album loses quite a bit of momentum on some of his covers including his versions of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On and R.E.M.'s 1992 hit Everybody Hurts. The downside is that the covers don't have the feeling that actually was brought to life by the peformers he remade those songs on, especially his remake of Maybe I'm Amazed by Paul McCartney.<br /><br />All in all, this is just one of those rare records that really misses the mark for Joe Cocker. While some might feel interested in this, others will just want to cover this one away. Newcomers might enjoy this one, but longtime Joe Cocker fans might not feel this one is so beautiful.<br /><br />Songs: C<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Cover: B<br /><br />Overall: C-
B00008H2LB|5.0|I am an avid music listener. Out of all of my cd's, Meteora is the one that is stuck in my cd player all the time. I can't take it out and find something better to replace it with. Not only is the music fantastic, but the lyrics are amazing as well. There is not a single track on this cd that doesn't blow me away. The cd starts out with a cool intro, which leads into \\"Don't Stay.\\" This is a song with a very strong vibe that is a great way to start off any cd. Chester's vocals are fantastic, almost unbelievable to me that he can sing like this every day of his life and still have a voice. Next on the List is \\"Somewhere I Belong.\\" This is the song that truly made me fall in love with Linkin Park. Sure, I liked them before, but after I listened to this song over and over again, I realized how flawless Mike's lyrics and vocals are. There's a very powerful message in this song. \\"Lying From You\\" is catchy right from the beginning, I would have liked to see a real music video for this instead of the concert video. Next comes \\"Hit The Floor,\\" my absolute favorite track on the cd. This song is very underrated. It was never a single and was never sung at the concerts I attended. I absolutely love the lyrics and will never get tired of this amazing song. \\"Easier To Run\\" is the slowest song on the cd, but it is still a great track. Next comes \\"Faint,\\" and honestly - who couldn't love this song? It says in the cd booklet that this song was much slower when they first recorded it, but they decided to change the speed from 70 beats per minute to 135 beats per minute. I don't think it would have been as popular as it was if they hadn't increased the tempo. Great song. \\"Figure.09\\" is my second favorite track on the cd, and is also very underrated. I definately this should have been one of the many singles from this cd because it is so amazing. \\"Breaking the Habit\\" is an amazing song to see them sing live. It starts off very slow with Chester singing acapella. Then, the music startsand it blows me away. Fantastic song with great lyrics. \\"From The Inside\\" is a very good track with Chester really using his voice again. It's amazing. \\"Nobody's Listening\\" is another one of my favorites, I love the chorus. Then comes \\"Session,\\" a song that once in a while I could listen to all day - every day. There's just something catchy about it. Listen to it with headphones on, it'll sound alot different.  Finally there is \\"Numb.\\" A great song to end the CD with, great lyrics, and great vocals. If you don't have this cd, go get it. Youll really be amazed.
0688156819|4.0|Tim Burton is pure genius. In this little book of melancholy poetry he combines humor, darkness and independent thought into indescribable delight. <br /> <br />This petite book of 23 short poems is the definition of creativity and artistic expression. Burton's poetry is simple, rhythmical and completely unique. His characters are as varied as \\"James\\" to \\"The Boy With Nails in His Eyes,\\" each offering a touch of whimsy beside an outsider existence. Anyone who has ever felt different will somehow relate! Complete with Burton's own drawings of each distinctive character it is a very entertaining experience.  <br /> <br />If you enjoy Tim Burton's films and relate to his ability to tell the tale of misshapen outcasts you will enjoy this chance to savor Burton in print. Adults and children alike can chuckle and moan at the inventiveness of a true original.    <br />
B000069HK2|5.0|Okay..well I'm sad to see that The Used has not gained a higher level of success and fame. I think that Bert McCracken (lead singer) is very, very talented and the music is so relatable and catchy. Catchy in an upset, headbanging, angsty kind of way. Anyways, I love them (the used). They are so talented. I also recommend listening to Taking Back Sunday and My Chemical Romance. FO' SHO! hehe
038073186X|5.0|Yes this book is a real page turner.  It was recommended to me three days ago and I've already finished it and am rightly confused and wondering what it all means.  It is a great story of distortion, suspense, intrique and deceit.  I really enjoyed this book and I guess the ending is left up to everyone's own interpretation.  Go read it.  You will be pleasantly surprised if not confused and mesmerized for a long time.
B00005JNEW|4.0|First off, <br />You losers writing about the inaccuracies of the movie as compared to the book need to get a life.  Nobody cares if the score of the Dallas Carter game was \\"technically\\" different in real life. Im sure if your anal enough(and have enough time on your hands) you can find innacuracies in 'Hoosiers\\" and \\"Miracle\\". <br />Second, <br />Even the director(Peter Berg) and the book writer mention in the dvd commentary the select few scenes in the movie that were different from the book and different from real life.  The overall intent of the movie was to relay the real-life theme of Odessa and that Permian team during the \\"88\\" season, not list what was said by each player word for word.    <br />Last,  <br />Obviously the movie was great, not because its based on a true story but because its not shot as every other sports movie out there.  It was shot like a real life documentary which adds to the reality of the whole situation.  Derek Luke is 100% believable and Billy Bob did a brilliant job of portraying the real life situations that the Permian coach faced during the season(boosters, injuries, the media).  I also loved the Roy Williams cameo as the Midland Lee coach, it was hillarious.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|This is the ULTIMATE collection of ROCKIN' Garage Band Classics!  You get the full range of musical treats, from ersatz Beatle wannabe bands to folks doing covers, such as Michael & the Messengers covering the Reflections' 1964 \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\"  There is no lack of talent on this entire collection and certainly no lack of enthusiasm and energy.  This collection is what 1960s Garage Band afficionados have been praying for!<br /><br />Listeners will cruise down Cool Memory Lane in a Cool 1965 Dodge Dart 270 Custom Sedan with the dial set to COOL 196.5 (1965 all the time) while enjoying this musical banquet.  The list of treats is quite extensive.<br /><br />Although I didn't care for Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs 1965 hit, \\"Wooly Bully\\" or the Strangeloves' 1965 hit, \\"I Want Candy,\\" I had to smile that the ultimate in Garage Band hits, the Kingsmen's 1963 magnum opus \\"Louie, Louie\\" was included.  Seriously, I think \\"Louie, Louie\\" has become the Garage Band anthem and has been held as the symbol of garage band success for others, such as the much loved, much covered \\"G-L-O-R-I-A,\\" which I am surprised is not on this collection; the Strawberry Alarm Clock's 1967 \\"Incense and Peppermint,\\" and the Outsiders' 1966 gem, \\"Time Won't Let Me.\\"  The Kingsmen, whose 1963 smash, recorded in Oregon, helped identify the Pacific Northwestern United States as a musical mecca to be reckoned with.  The Sonics of 1965 \\"Have Love, Will Travel\\" fame and Paul Revere and the Raiders were among those Pacific Pioneers.<br /><br />The 13th Floor Elevators, an Austin, Texas band have proved to be a major musical force.  They have played the same venues with Janis Joplin and have demonstrated a unique musical flair.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE the Rumors' \\"Hold ** Now,\\" an EXCELLENT Garage Band piece that has been sadly overlooked by the public at large.  This is such an excellent song that will make you want to dance.  It is at the time of this review included in an exhibit at a local library featuring a Garage Band of the 1960s.  This song is a party for the ears and will actually have you dancing!<br /><br />Many favorite Top 40 stand-bys have been included, such as \\"Time Won't Let Me,\\" by the Outsiders and \\"Lies\\" by the Knickerbockers, two 1966 hits; \\"Dirty Water\\" by the Standells and a genuine gem, Music Explosion's 1967 smash, \\"Little Bit O' Soul.\\"  This collection is such a treat and I can't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />Treat yourself to this collection.  You will be so glad that you did.e 1960s.  This song is a party for the ears and will actually have you dancing!

B0002OERI0|4.0|Well what is there to say? I think that any green day fan would have to agree that this is one of the best albums that green day has ever released. Or at least I think so. However, I am a Republican and I must say that this album is very politically charged and controversial. A republican could find some of the lyric's quite offending. That would have to be the one thing that I am not so into on this album. But then there are the catchy songs that you can't help putting on repeat on your cd player. These songs consist of She's A Rebel, Whatsername, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and many more. And the music, guitar, etc.. is outstanding and Billy Joe proves again to have a talented and unique voice!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Not a big fan of Metallica's music, I have great respect for all that they've accomplished throughout their career.  I approached this documentary as a big music fan with an intense interest on watching how musicians/bands work behind the scenes when creating an album.  Not only does \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" display that, it also displays a band that has lost a longtime band member, hired a therapist to help them \\"work through\\" their problems, and had their lead singer/lyricist admit himself into rehab.  If watching all this unfold sounds like it would keep you interested, then pick this up!   <br /> <br />There are many great things about this movie.  Namely, it's not a vanity piece where each member of Metallica is made to look like they are gods.  Instead, each member is seen in different lights.  The viewer respects the fact that James Hetfield's new work schedule after getting out of rehab has to slow down a bit, but feels drummer Lars Ulrich's frustration at someone else putting a limit on his creative timeline.  It's very interesting to behold.  What makes matters even more interesting (and I'm sure many of Metallica's fans will disagree with me) is that here is a band going through a tremendous amount of inner turmoil and very hard work all to complete a new album...and the resulting music/lyrics are really not that good.  I've said I wasn't a fan, but I can appreciate and understand why other people like Metallica.  With the music that was created for \\"St. Anger\\"...the magic just doesn't seem to be happening. <br /> <br />This is a film not only for Metallica's fans, but also any fans of music who enjoy watching creative minds/struggles at work.  Packed with great extras as well.  A+
B000084T18|4.0|This is a pretty good album. I really like the beats and rhymes in it. Go buy this cd, its awesome.
B000003TAR|3.0|In Utero is not exactly what its cracked up to be but its a heck of a lot better than the power pop album mess called Nevermind .There's actually some decent stuff on here. Serve the Servants , Rape Me,Dumb and All Apologies are pretty good , and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter is pretty cool . However what , to me, is most striking thing about this album is the musicianship. It stinks. I  understand that guitar solos are not in vogue , but can you at least learn how to play your guitar - even mediocrity would be an impprovement on this crap. The other thing that i find puzzling are the lyrics - I understand its fashionable to brood , but these lyrics could've easily been written by a twelve year old. No one will ever mistake Cobain for Dylan ( unfortunately quite a few people have )I also understand that every generation needs its heroes but damn , Nirvana isnt even close to the best grunge band out there - let alone one of the great bands of all time .
0399242864|5.0|How to Catch a Star is a story of a young boy who tries again and again to catch a star, then sees a star reflected in the water and figures it fell from the sky.  He tries to grab it, but it just slips through his fingers.  On the walk along the beach to his home, he finds a starfish and thinks it's a star from the sky.  The last picture is of the boy sitting with his starfish and reading to it.  Even though the story has been told before (think Pooh), it's always magical, and the illustrations are simple, yet mesmerizing. This is a wonderful bedtime book and would also make a great read-aloud in a classroom, where it could be used in a beginning astronomy unit.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This was the last project for Ray Charles, the innovator of soul, an icon and legend who's career spanned over 50 yrs.  Each song is a duet with a different artist.  <br /> <br />1. Here We Go Again with Norah Jones.  This is a nice song to start the album.  A relative newcomer, Jones, starts the song.  She is very talented and her voice works well with Ray.  It has a touch of a country feel to it <br /> <br />2. Sweet Potato Pie with James Taylor.  The background music works with the voices so well.  This song uses more jazz than most of the other songs. <br /> <br />3. You Don't Know Me with Diana Krall.  This song was always one of my favorites.  I love the duet too.  It starts the same way as the original, but Krall adds a different feeling to it.  Her voice contrasts with Ray's so nicely. <br /> <br />4. Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word with Elton John.  I always want to cry when I hear this song.  I hear Ray differently than I ever heard him before.  Part of it is his illness/old age which humble his voice, making it much more emotional.  He sings from his heart so powerfully with this song.  Elton is emotional in this song as well making it so powerful. <br /> <br />5.Fever with Natalie Cole.  This song is one of the faster songs.  It has some cute dialoge in it between Natalie and Ray.  I like the reference to Pochahontas. <br /> <br />6. Do I Ever Cross Your Mind? with Bonnie Raitt.  This song has a country feel to it.  Anyone who bought Ray Charles does Country and Western will love this song.  I love it. <br /> <br />7. It Was a Very Good Year with Willie Nelson.  This is more of a story than song, but it rhymes.  It's not one of my favorites, but it's ok. <br /> <br />8. Hey Girl with Michael McDonald.  This is a sweet, slow song.  It's very peaceful. <br /> <br />9. Sinners Prayer with B.B. King.  This song reminds me of the jazz clubs that Ray would play in.  I like it. <br /> <br />10. Heaven Help us All with Gladys Knight.  Stevie Wonder's gospel song is back and it's great. <br /> <br />11. Over the Rainbow with Johnny Mathis.  This song has a very different tone from Ray solo, but I like it as well.  It's slower and softer. <br /> <br />12. Crazy Love with Van Morrison.  The perfect song to end with, it's lively, well done and simply fabulous.  The perfect note to think about Ray on.  Overall, this CD is amazing and I beseech all Ray fans to buy it.
B00029LNHS|3.0|Though this album is pretty good, it get's a 3/5 from me. The reason i gave it a low score is becasue (and I think most people agree) the radio stations play Let's get Retarded/Started and Hey Mama waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to much (well, they used to, that is).
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. I have never really cried during a movie until The Notebook, but it was just soooo good.  It is a chick flick but I do know some men who have seen it and been just as moved by it as the women. Even if you have never seen it before, it is def a must buy!!!
0767903862|5.0|In this, yet another jewel in Bryson's considerable literary crown, the author takes his readership into the exotic, eccentric and dangerous world of Australia. Using his unique blend of travellouge, history and personal memoir Bryson paints a fascinating portrait of a nation rich in culture and vast in space but unfortunately overlooked by much of the rest of the world. <br /> <br />Using his unique brand of scatalogical humor and personal insight (his description of not only how he sleeps but how he reacts to fear inspires peals of raging laughter)Bryson journeys throughout Australia's varied continent absorbing many of her treasures and traps. IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY, Bryson debunks many misconceptions about the former British Penal Colony as well as holds up the special personalities that make her citizens stand proud. He goes beyond the \\"Steve Irwin and Crocodile Dundee\\" stereotypes and paints a picture of a nation filled with world class intellectuals and athletes.  <br /> <br />He also refuses to pull any punches as he frequently tempers the humor with many sobering truths (the treatment of the Aboriginies to mention just one example). That he can be so balanced is a testament to his talent as a writer. <br /> <br />According to Bryson, Australia is a country filled with the most hostile ecosystem on earth and yet thrives with perhaps the most diverse biological assortment known to man. It is a special place. I may not be able to afford a trip yet. But Bryson's book is almost as good as being there. <br /> <br />Almost.
B00068IOWM|1.0|I cant begin to describe how bitterly disappointed I am! We were ripped off, really. I can't believe this upset is a 'U2' album.  <br /> <br />Do not be fooled by the marketing machine and the press reviews calling this a 'return to their roots' or whatever...there is NOTHING in this fraud that is reminiscant of any of the 80s U2 albums. This is just copy-paste from the overrated 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. I wish there was a rating lower than 1 STAR. HTDAAB is the biggest step back for U2's career ever, even worse than Rattle & Hum. At least that album had its memorable moments. I don't know, I mean, I really don't know how someone could say this recycled-music album is 'Their third masterpiece !!' or 'The best since Achtung Baby !!', etc. <br /> <br />The deterioration of U2 as musicians is so obvious. They are just completely run out of ideas. HTDAAB is U2's least artistic album and most unoriginal effort to date but some of their fanbase won't care. It's still gonna sell like crazy.  <br /> <br />I can't even listen to this album in full as I always have to skip tracks 1-3-4-7-9 and 10. Most of this commercial tunes are extremely boring and safe. If you look up \\"filler\\" in the dictionary, it will read 'Vertigo', 'Sometimes you Can't Make It On Your Own', 'Love And Peace Or Else', 'A Man And A Woman', 'One Step Closer' and 'Original Of The Species' ( the worst U2 song ever ). <br />When track 11 is finished the agony of listening to this uninspired effort is over. This album is really a torture for me. I can't stand listening to that strained Bono's voice !!. <br /> <br />U2 have become the most hypocritical and overrated band ever.

B0002858YS|4.0|An excellent start to a cd with \\"Jenny was a friend of Mine\\" and \\"Somebody told Me\\", but it goes downhill from there, the rest is kinda weird. Still, it's a good cd.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|This band sucks. This has got to be one of the most overrated bands ever. They add sreaming into a pop-rock song and call it metal. That is if it can be called screaming. The singer's whiny emo voice alone should be enough to convince you that this band isn't metalcore. Want real metalcore? Listen to Hatebreed, God Forbid, old Killswitch Engage, On Broken Wings, Throwdown, Chimaira, Bury Your Dead, Between The Buried And Me, Terror, Merauder, etc. Want real metal in general? Listen to Cannibal Corpse, At The Gates, Mnemic, Meshuggah, Strapping Young Lad, Behemoth, etc. Just leave this CD on the shelves.
0743455967|5.0|I usually don't read books often, and when I do I normally am not very into it.  I bought a copy of \\"on writing\\", and as I flipped through the pages this novel seemed to captivate me.  In a very unique manner steven King employs both a lesson to the aspirin writer and a autobiography which presets a little information about his life as well.  The advice given in this book should not be missed by anybody.  Reading this book gave me more confidence in my capabilities as a writer-reading a book like this could do the same for you.  Steven Kings on writing is a great novel, and it finds ways to amaze even the most hateful readers(literally).  Use me as an example.
0783226845|5.0|For me the best movie I have ever seen since it goes beyond the usual shallowness of regular pictures, and characters have great complexity. You won't get dissapointed!  Worth watching many many times, and enjoy all those times.
B00006LWSF|4.0|The album is pretty good. Got some great stuff, and then got some bad stuff, but mostly good. This cd is definently worth your money, though.
B0006L7U9W|4.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is without a doubt the most faithful reproduction I have seen of 1930s and 40s science fiction cinema. Director Kerry Conran not only captured the innocence of the decade but also much of the visual flare that has made retro so cool in a modern era where technology has become cold and lifeless by design. Already hailed by many as ground breaking for its completely computer rendered back drops and special effects its hard not to be impressed with the world Kerry and his brother have envisioned. While the CG work here is obvious it never detracts from the enjoyment of the film. One gets the feeling that Conran is aware of the limitations of the technology and that instead of shying away from it he embraces it as did the pioneers of early cinema. Jude Law is perfect here as the strong headed hero fly boy and Gwyneth Paltrow brings just the right amount of Tomboy Lois Lane charm required for her role. The script is a little stunted and the acting a little cold in places but it is all done with tongue firmly planted in cheek and on repeat viewings more of the story and minor details reveal themselves. This is the most original Sci Fi story to emerge from Hollywood in a long time and as the studios become more enraptured with the cerebral and lifeless offerings that are pouring out of production houses currently this may the last Gee Whiz film youll see for some time.
0634060384|5.0|Great book, great condition.  Endless amounts of music.  Just wished they had it in Eb and Bb now.
B000006NUW|3.0|You can not fault the music.  The songs included here all deserve a special place in music history.  However, the sound quality leaves much to be desired.  Every track is presented in the original mono version (this is not mentioned anywhere on the packaging);and, if any of the songs were \\"remastered\\" I would be very suprised.  If you want to hear this music like you did the first time, in AM radio mono-quality sound, this is a great purchase. It might be best to search out \\"remastered\\" greatest hits releases from some of the individual artists included here  if you can afford it.
B000006TZ8|5.0|All Mod Cons is where everything really came together for The Jam.  The songs and the writing matured by leaps and bounds compared to The Modern World.  Weller has some of his best work on this album including the beautiful ballad \\"English Rose,\\" the stumbling anger of the title track, and the chilling \\"Down In A Tube Station At Midnight\\" with it's rapid fire drums and funky walking bass lending a real sense of urgency to the story being unfolded by Weller.  His social commentary here is biting and pissed off and though the music spread out in more directions with Weller building off his various influences (especially R&B), the spirit of the album is punk, through and through.  A wonderful disc that gets stronger with every listen and it remains one of the great original punk albums as well as one of the great British albums of all time.
B00000099Y|2.0|I think 2 stars is generous..There are only about 1 mabye 2 good \\"songs\\" / Noise tracks on this album the rest suck and I'm really sorry I wasted my time and money on it.
B00000612P|5.0|Wow...the remastering job here is superb!  The highlight for me is the tone of Woody's acoustic guitar work.  I swear it sounds like he's playing his six string Martin  right in my living room (or passenger seat, if I'm jamming in the car).  The overall sound here is just fantastic.  No need to comment on the music: classic & arguably Rod's best solo work.  Also, chances are if you're reading this....you're already a Rod Stewart fan wondering if buying the \\"remaster\\" is worth it.  YES!   Plus, to hear these songs in the context of the album and not in a greatest hits package makes the experience even more enjoyable.  The price is extremely reasonable and you can even go zShops for an even  better price.  You can't take it with you anyway!
B000002L82|5.0|What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in \\"Power, Corruption Lies\\" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.   <br /> <br />The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for \\"Blue Monday\\" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  \\"Age of Consent\\" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also \\"the Village\\"  is a great track as well. <br /> <br />If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it! <br /> <br />-- Ted Murena
B00007LTIC|3.0|Shame on all the revisionist reviewers and critics who claim this is a great album. This album was bad when it came out, and it's still bad. The main problem here is the production; the original tracks on this album are overproduced, just too slick. They sounded horrible in 1977, and they sound even more ridiculous now. Part of the problem here is Wakeman, whose playing sounds anachronistic on this outing. But I've always thought that Wakeman was the most overrated musician in Yes... <br /> <br />But on this reissue, Rhino salvages some great music from what was an extremely flawed project. Tracks 6-12 are the most interesting tracks on this album.  Squire's take on \\"Amazing Grace\\" is stunning. Squire, Howe, and White's rehearsal of \\"Going for the One\\" (sans vocals and Wakeman) absolutely smokes--if you're a '70s rock fan, this track makes the disc worth it. The other rehearsal tracks also possess a spontaneity and lo-fi quality that makes them far superior to their studio-hampered offspring. Wakeman's playing is much better here because he's restricted to one raw track. This disc is worth your dollars but keep to the added tracks.
B0000029GA|5.0|Get it, right now if you don't have it!! This album is the best one created, together with Ready to Die and Life after Death, or the Marshall Mather's Lp. And I must admit, although  Biggie's my favourite MC of all times, Illmatic even stands higher then his albums. This street poetry at its best, a work of a genius. <br />Anybody who doubts hip-hop as a valuable art should just listen to it. Also, all those suburban 13-year olds who adore Gay- unit and all those cats whith Lil' in their names should listen to this album. This puts to shame everybody nowadays, Ludacris, Lloyd whateva' his name is, and so on. <br />I repeat myself - This is  the best hip-hop album ever!
B00009Z576|5.0|As far as Yes is concerned, Chris Squire is the straw that stirs the drink. Any doubters should listen to Fish Out of Water, Squire's 1970s solo project that is a lost Yes album of sorts (and quite an excellent one). Anyway, I must disagree with Mr. Squire's opinion that this is an inferior Yes project. Drama was the best Yes album since Relayer and is the last great Yes album--period. \\"It can Happen\\" is the last great Yes song but 90125 is an inferior album to Drama. <br /> <br />So, yes, Drama has the Buggles (Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes) instead of Anderson and Wakeman. Don't let that frighten you away. Those Buggles boys were huge Yes fans and they inject new life into Howe, Squire and White, all of whom play like raging hell on these sessions. Those guys lay it down on this album--and if you're pining for Anderson and Wakeman, you'll get over it quickly (especially when you hear the bonus Paris outtakes which include John and Rick). Out are the sneaker ad lyrics of Going for the One, replaced by tightly wound, intelligent lyrics (of mostly the sci-fi and sci-fact variety)and equally tight musicianship.  <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who said he wished they kept this line-up together for another recording.  Drama sounded great on 8 track--it still sounds great today. Own up to this record, Mr. Squire. It's a very, very good one..
0060934913|5.0|Read this book one summer by a pool in Key West and people around me thought I was crazy as I burst out laughing 7-8 times.  The stories are crude, arrogant, racist, sexist and saturated with addictions from nicotine to the hard stuff. Overall, a great read if you can take the abuse and understand that it's meant to give a glimpse into the back alley deals and inner workings of the restaurant biz. <br /> <br />If you even have a twinkle of an aspiration to open a restaurant some day, it's a must read on what to AVOID and who NOT to hire!  Even better when read with rum flavored libations, under a few palm trees.... but that's just my opinion!
B00028HBKM|1.0|The Passion of Jesus Christ, a film I fear with a PASSION and it does not matter how many times I watch it, I just can't shake off my unease about this film, even more so now that it is so widely available on DVD.<br /><br />Mel Gibson did a grand even amazing job overall, glorious scenery, great actors, costumes to make your eyes boggle, an amazing musical score, subtitles, unheard of in a mega-blockbuster, enough blood and gore even for the most fanatical lover of blood and guts, along with a haunting, dramatic look into the violent final hours of the life of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Now why do I fear this film?

B0002OERI0|5.0|I have to say that I don't listen to too much of the current music, but this CD KICKS ASS!  I was never really into this band because when they were popular while I was in high school, I had gone backwards a bit and got into more of the classic rock.  But my husband recently bought this CD and told me to check it out.  Of course I've seen the video for \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" quite a few times and I really like that song, but the rest of the CD is just as good, if not better.  My favorite song has to be \\"Are We The Waiting\\".  It reminds me of the 80s.  Also love \\"Holiday\\", \\"St. Jimmy\\", and \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\".  Check out the second section of that song.  Sounds like Motley Crue's \\"On With The Show\\" (something my husband pointed out).  This is a great CD for anyone, especially if you're wanting something different.  They definitely deserve a Grammy or two for this one!!
078574858X|5.0|I picked this up, half-way kidding to show my mom (who is going to be a librarian) when I was looking for a book for my sophomore English class.  I decided to check it out with about 10 other books and I eventually chose it to read.  I ended up really enjoying it.  Her plot is so interwoven and threw me off the trail of the murderer many times.  The characters felt real to me and I am looking forward to reading another one of her novels.
0316172324|5.0|Since reading the Tipping Point couple of months ago I became a big fan of Malcom Gladwell and have sent the book as a birthday gift to at least 5 people.  I mention this just to worn you that I am a little biased. <br /> <br />Gladwell is extremely good at simplifying common phenomena, which is usually known by many but is usually too complex to describe.  He is also a master in gluing you to his books.  He does this through the number of case studies each of which is a mini course in its field. <br /> <br />The part that liked most was the case study about the pentagon's war game.  It is a crash course in leadership and team management which is very very informative and entertaining at the same time.   <br />
B00005JM4Z|4.0|I personally liked this movie as well as the first.  Granted it relied heavily on Paul Walker but I think he did a great job and Tyrese brought the humor.  It worked well for them...you can tell they had a friendship chemistry because it flowed for them.  I loved this movie and thought the action was there...the cars were neat and I liked the music.   <br /> <br />In this movie Paul is no longer a cop and is involved in drag racing in order for them not to arrest him they make him a deal to help uncover a drug ring and he tells them he wants to have his own buddy work on the case with him (Tyrese) only problem is Tyrese is on house arrest and lives in a trailer so he can move his house. (Funny!)  They don't really like one another because of some past business, but well work well together!  Together will try and bust the drug ring and to find out if they do watch the movie!  It is worth it!  The racing in this movie is also great along with the cars.  They are tircked out to the max!  If you compare this movie to the first one it is not exactly up to the same speed.  But one its own this movie holds its ground!

B0000VAFNQ|5.0|Underworld is magnificent!  It is a battle between Lycans and Vampires. <br /> <br />From the music to the dark set.  This movie is awesome!  You get pulled into the movie at the opening when you see Vampires watching the city and then they go in for the hunt because they see Lycans are in the city and following someone.  It starts out with action as they start a whole scene fighting one another.  It is not your typical love story it is more based on Vampires vs. Lycans but you get a sense of love with Kate and Scott.  But it in now way takes away from the action you feel in this movie.  You will not be displeased with this movie it has a lot of cool special effects and the blood going into Viktor  was neat.  I love when they also walk into the house and the cool techno music was playing and the Vampires were just all sitting around while they crew walked through.  It is a great movie with great heart.  I read some reviews and not sure why so bad I usually hate movies like this but I love this one! <br />
1401300901|2.0|Unfortunately this book did not meet my requirements of a proper novel. The writing is elementary, characters undeveloped and not interesting. Perhaps the novelist will mature with experience.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|Harry Potter is back for his 3rd year at Hogwarts.  Just as the first two movies this movie keeps your interest.  Yet, my only flaw is that the 3rd book is full of so much it is hard to cut it down into one movie...I heard Movie 4 will be in two parts...which I think I may like better.  I wasn't feeling this movie as much as the first two although the more I watch it the more I get caught up in the movie.   <br /> <br />This book Harry doesn't deal with Voldemort but Sirus Black who they feel is a follower of Voldeort.  Harry runs away from his home because it is his last straw at the Dursleys.  On his way to Hogwarts Harry is encountered by dementors and is challenged in his wizardry.  I think that Prof. Trelawney is funny and well acted.  I think my favorite besides Harry is Ron though Rupert is great and his faces can entertain you alone.  Over-all this movie is well made for what content it had to work with.  I also love the Harry Potter books so much that even though I enjoy the movies the books are better.

B0000041WM|5.0|This recording was my second recording of Verdi's Rigoletto. My first was the 1979 recording under Carlo Maria Giulini on the Deutsche Grammophon label. It's a great recording, and I reccomend it to any Verdi opera-lover. So, if you will pardon me, when I review this set, I may (as in, will) compare it to the Giulini set. <br /> <br />The first thing I noticed is that Chailly's pace is quicker in the first scene after the Prelude (the party fanfare). I liked it, because it gave the scene a more party-like feeling, for lack of a better phrase. <br /> <br />Now, to get this across - I'm not a huge fan of Luciano Pavarotti. I respect him as a musician, but I'm not terribly fond of his voice. Sure, he can hit those high notes, but he as a bit of a \\"pop\\"-ish tone, in my opinion. I will admit though - he does play a good Duke of Mantua. But if I had to choose, I'd go with Placido Domingo - even in the mid-80's when he did a video recording of Leoncavallo's I Pagliacci, he still had that rich tenor tone (albeit age had taken away a bit of it) that I will always love from the Giulini set. <br /> <br />The same thing goes to the role of Rigoletto. I haven't heard Leo Nucci sing any role apart from this, so I really can't compare him to his other recordings or anything. However, he does sing a good Rigoletto. His \\"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata\\" was especially good. However, if you are looking for a better Rigoletto, look for the Giulini set's Rigoletto, Piero Cappuccilli. Arguably one of the best operatic baritones I've heard (up there with Zoltan Kelemen and Hans Hotter, to be completely honest), his bel canto style as Rigoletto is astounding. <br /> <br />What the Chailly set truly offers is an incredible Gilda. June Anderson, like Giulini's Ileana Cotrubas, achieves Verdi's idea of a light soprano, but Anderson gives it much more feeling and depth than Cotrubas. The death scene played by Anderson was simply incredible, and I found myself feeling sorrier for the faithful Rigoletto than I did when I first heard it under Giulini. <br /> <br />The supporting cast for both sets are great. Natale de Carolis sings a good Count Monterone, but in no way could he ever top Kurt Moll's performance as the angry count. Kurt Moll essentially \\"stole the show\\" in the Giulini set for me, if you'll pardon the phrase. I'm sure you're all giving your screens a queer expression, but...hey, Kurt Moll is great. Nicolai Ghiaurov sings a great Sparafucile in both sets, though in the Chailly set you can tell that he wasn't as young as he used to be, and his \\"Russian wobble\\" is more evident in 1989 than it was in 1967. <br /> <br />The most surprising aspect of the Chailly set is the orchestra. I'd never listened to the Teatro Comunale di Bologna's orchestra, and I must say they were really good. As most recordings I own are either the Vienna Philharmonic (the Giulini set among them), the Berlin Philarmonic, or the German National Opera's orchestra, it was nice to hear a new group.  <br /> <br />Final verdict? I suggest giving both a try. Think about it in terms of Mussorgsky's final edit of Boris Godunov, and Rimsky-Korsakov's version: there isn't a substitute, just another way of doing it. Giulini's set has its' drawbacks and bonuses, as does the Chailly set. Both have a different way of portraying the genius of Giuseppe Verdi.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is the first in the Harry Potter Movie series...it is also one of the best ones!  I was just amazed by the job that this movie is so close to the book (which is excellent!).  I realize that you either hear really good reviews of Harry Potter or really bad reviews...there really isn't much of an in-between.  I am a Harry Potter lover turned into one from one who wouldn't even touch the books.  But before this movie came out I decided to go into the hype and was happy when I saw this movie! <br /> <br />Harry is living with his Aunt and Uncle Dursley...and it is now time for Harry to start wizard school so Hogwarts sends Harry letters but Uncle Vernon doesn't want any of it!  So he keeps destroying the letters but in the end Hogwarts wins and Hagrid comes and takes Harry with him.  When he goes to school he is introduced to Hermione and Ron and they all become best friends.  They are also introduced to many of the other characters who will play a role in the movie and book.  Harry is always in trouble but rarely causes the trouble.  It tends to follow him.  He is also fighting to keep away from Lord Voldemort because he is the one who killed his parents.  But he can not stay alone for long.  Also some of the professors are fishy acting (watch to find out!)  and in the end the professor who is after the Sorcerer's Stone is not who you think!   <br /> <br />This movie is great for young and old and is a movie that will keep you intrigued from beginning until the end! <br />
B00023BLXK|1.0|This film deserves an award: A Razzie that is. What a complete waste of my money. I purchased this movie thinking that it would have some great dancing in it and possibly a nice love story, but I was sooooo wrong! The dancing fell flat,and the love story was dried up and boring. The two lead characters have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever, and their acting was the pits. This movie was very lame. I don't know how some people can say that it was better than the original dirty dancing. That is not true at all! The original is a classic! Great dancing and great storyline, which Havana Nights does NOT have!!!!! In fact, it's NOTHING like the original. I don't even know how it can even be called a sequel of it. The only bright spot of it, were the Patrick Swayze appearances, and some of the dancing was okay, but that's it, just \\"okay\\". Don't make the same mistake I did: please boycott this movie, unless you love Cuban dancing and music, but even there, the movie falls flat. Save your money......
B00008DDXL|5.0|The second Harry Potter movie lives up the first one but some magic was lost.  I still loved it!  I loved the innocence of Harry and Ron and the way that they are friends with Hermione.  Just a great movie for all young and old! <br /> <br />Harry gets help in going back to school although a house elf named Dobby  doesn't want him to.  As he knows that Harry is in great danger!  But Harry is saved by Ron and the Wesely brothers come and save him in the flying car...which is cool shown on screen.  And we begin Harry's second year at Hogwarts.  I loved this movie...full of action and fantasy.  There are many things we learn about Harry in this movie such as someone is a parseltounge.  If you read the books you will already know what happens but it is neat to see how someone else sees the same thing you did.  And if you haven't read the book and loved the first movie I think you will be happy with one as it give you insight into Harry and will help with future books and movies.   <br />

B0006A9FKA|1.0|When I saw this film had been rated 4 1/2 stars I nearly fell out of my chair. Why? because this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you're looking for a synopsis on this movie, look else where. Me and my cousin decided to give this a try. About 3/4 the way through we got up and left. It was just so horrible. It was slow paced, NOT funny, boring, had characters you really hate and are unlike-able, and just made you want to puke. The acting wasn't too bad, but the rest was. I can only remember one funny bit, and it wasn't even that funny. It's a horrible rip-off of 'Dawn of the Dead.' <br />This movie does not deserve 4 1/2 stars. Awsome movies like The Evil Dead trilogy deserve 4 1/2 stars, even five. But this, no way. I'm guessing the reason why this film was rated so high was because most of the reviewers were British (no offense) and blinded by pride, which they have a right too. But it was just plain horrible. I hope most of you won't vote my review as being bad simply because I hate a movie you like, that's intolerant. <br />On a last note, rent it. Never ever buy it with out renting it first, even though it's not really worth renting...
B00070Q7VO|5.0|It's Time is a pleasure to listen to.  Michael Buble is a very talented singer.  He  sounds like the Frank Sinatra of the 21st century.  He even covers the classic Sinatra song I've Got you Under My Skin superbly.  He also covers the Beatles hit Can't Buy Me Love here, and he gives it a pleasant lively spin.  My favorite track is Home though.  It is an excellent song about being away from someone you love and longing to be with that person.  Another highlight track on this CD is the duet with Nelly Furtado Quando Quando Quando.  It is a very romantic song about two people in love.  I also enjoyed the song Feeling Good.  It is an optimistic song of renewal.  This track has a nice jazz sound to it,  that I really liked it.  Try A Little Tenderness is a pretty song.  It is a reminder to show a little compassion and tenderness to someone who needs it.  Buble's voice is so soothing especially on a song like You Don't Know Me.  This song is so relaxing.  I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys good music.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Although it sounds similar to When Harry Met Sally, it's not as long, but just as good. While reading the blurb on the back, I thought this was going to be another attempt at a classic, but was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't so keen on John Cusack. There's just nothing interesting about him I'm afraid. He looks like every other generic male star out there. He's like Hugh Jackman when he doesn't have his X-Men beard.<br /><br />This is an absolutely fantastic movie, all about fate and destiny, with Kate Beckinsdale, as the kooky perfectionist, who gets nervous when the engagement ring her boyfriend gets her doesn't fit. Of course her boyfriend is supposed to instantly know her ring size - I don't even know my ring size! At the start of the movie, she meets John Cusack's character, Johnathan, and refuses to tell him her name. She decides that fate will decide whether they will get to know each other, including leaving her scarf behind, and finding, getting him to write his name & number on a $5 note, and then buying something with it. This idea seemed particularly nuts, as she was going to wait for that same $5 note to come back into her purse. She then writes her name & number inside a book, and the gives it to a used bookshop the next day - the name of which she doesn't tell him. Of course, he goes into every single bookshop hoping to find this book. And then they get into different elevators in the Waldorf Astoria, and if they end up at the same floor, they're destined to be together.<br /><br />Of course, due to an annoying little child, despite both characters going to the 23rd floor, Jonathan ends up at that floor too late, and consequently misses Sara. Will they meet up years later?<br /><br />Kate is now going the same road as Catherine Zeta Jones, and was rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in Pearl Harbor (which is my favourite movie) and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film. Although her accent is one of those English ones that totally grates, she's fabulous. Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account.<br /><br />During filming of this movie in NYC, the following note was posted on a production trailer: \\"Yes, we are filming a movie. It is called 'Serendipity'. It stars John Cusack and some girl from Britain that you wouldn't know - even if we told you her name. We will be shooting tonight until midmorning. Please don't ask the crew any questions.

0553381350|4.0|This book was well written and enjoyable, and I like Tom Wolfe, but I kind of do not really see the point. The Russians put a man not only into space a month before we did in 1961, but put him into orbit. Good old righteous stuff Alan Shepard and John Glenn went subsequently in '61 and '62, but... what exactly was the point? Russia had already defeated us in this space race, and had sent Gagarin into orbit? JFK and US were so proud that many were crying when they saw what Shepard and Glenn did, but the truth is, America was behind USSR! Furthermore, Wolfe makes clear than it did not take too much to be an astronaut, as even a chimpanzee named Ham was able to do it. True skill in flying was like being X-1 test fighters, not being astronauts just \\"floating\\" in space. So where exactly was the right stuff? Russia beat us, and to be an astronaut was to float like a chimpanzee, seems that a more appropriate right stuff subject is the 1969 Moon Landing.
B000777J2S|1.0|When I first heard this cd tears came to my eyes too; not beacsue of his supposedly emotionally charged voice but becasue as soon as I first heard him sing with his god awful voice I realized that I had just wasted 15 of my hard erned dollars.  <br /> Music magazines claim \\"Antony's angel voice of singular majesty will bring tears to your eyes\\". DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!! <br />My take on Antony's latest \\"For I am a bird Nnow\\": his monstrous singing(it hurts to call it singing) will either scare new comers or make them laugh at this joke of an  artist you call Antony and the Johnsons. <br />           Note: the only highlight song in this album is sung, not surprisingly, by guest singer Rufus Wainwright.

0812550757|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading Speaker for the Dead, and highly recommend it to all readers mature enough to finish a book of such length. <br />   This is the 2nd book in the Ender series written by Orson Scott Card, and I think this is partially why the novel is so great. The first book, Ender's Game, which provided an extensive background to the situations and characters in Speaker for the Dead, even though the events covered in the story occur 3,000 years after Ender's Game.       <br />   All of the characters in the story have distinct personalities and are real, living characters. This is the result of excellent writing by Card, as is the total believability of the unique story this novel contains. Card's style often entails these sort of qualities. <br />   I especially enjoyed how the book can stand well alone, nearly as much so as when read in conjunction with the other books in the series. The story elements contained within are themselves entertaining enough to support the story, and the story's scope only expands exponentially when combined with the accompanying books.
B00014K5TQ|2.0|This movie stank. And by stank, I mean it just didn't work. And by it just didn't work, I mean it just didn't work. <br />The selection of actors was absolutely horrible. To have Macaulay Culkin, who you may remember from Home Alone portray a drug-addicted party monster is wrong. Just wrong. He recited his lines like a child does in his school play. His gay pronunciation of words was so unconvincing. And let's not forget Wilmer Valderamma, who seems to have the same expression, same tone of voice, same enthusiasm throughout the entire movie. Seth Green was too rugged to play the part of James St. James and Angel....oh Angel. Did they get this guy from American Idol? He simply cannot act. I was actually quite glad and excited that he died in the movie, although I wished it was done earlier and in a more brutal way. The script was dull, the actors were so transparent and the acting was the pits. I was so upset to see this movie flop as I am interested in Michael Alig and the Club Kids. I didn't think I would say this, but Marilyn Manson's scenes were actually pretty good. Those 37 seconds.  <br />Let's just say, it could have been a lot better.

0670033375|5.0|On page 521 of this book, Diamond describes himself as \\"a cautious optimist.\\"  The book is, in fact, quite upbeat, in spite of the dismal implications of the title.  The various negative reviewers who have gone before me have obviously not read the book.  It neither blames environmental destruction alone, nor resorts to the hysterical rhetoric of some environmentalists, nor does it trash industry.  In fact, there is a whole chapter, and several other long passages, on successful environmental initiatives by industries of all types.   <br />     He could have given the book a more accurate and less shocking title.  OK, \\"Collapse\\" sells copies, but the book is more about environmental problems, solutions and successes than outright collapses.  And it doesn't deal with the great collapses--the Roman Empire, for instance. <br />     Diamond considers several societies of the past that did themselves in by overusing their environments AND--critically important--by failing to get together and do something about it.  In some cases they just failed to control the situation, but in some the problem was that a society that was densely populated, and in delicate balance with its environment, was undone by dramatic climate change--most obviously when increasingly serious drought from 900 to 1300 did in the Anasazi and the central lowland Maya.  Warfare had a share in this, with increasing stress possibly increasing the warfare.   <br />     Equally interesting are the success stories that Diamond tells.  These more or less match the failures.  Easter Island failed, but the similar island of Tikopia (another tiny Polynesian island) did fine in managing resources.  The Maya failed, but Japan succeeded.  Greenland's Norse colony failed, Iceland's made it through.  Partly, this was a factor of environmental differences, but human succeess at getting everyone to work together was obviously the really important factor. <br />     Finally, Diamond discusses some modern cases where environmental overuse clearly contributed to civil meltdown. He is careful not to say it was \\"the cause,\\" however.  Bad government seems to be the cause of both the environmental mismanagement and the civil problems.  Once people are desperate, from poverty and want as well as from oppression and tyranny, they do desperate things. <br />     I have a good deal of expertise in this area, and I found virtually no mistakes in this book.  (One of note:  The Maya did not collapse so thoroughly as he thinks.  Many people and several marginal areas survived just fine.  But the collapse was real, and his take on it is sensible and informed.)  The book is also refreshingly free of biological reductionism; Diamond is fully aware that most of these are complex cases and that environmental mismanagement alone is rarely to blame. Some of his previous writings were full of naive biological reductionism and gratuitous trashing of indigenous people.  He has clearly listened to, and learned from, criticism.  He deploys, to advantage, many arguments that were deployed against some of his earlier work!  I really respect anyone who can learn from criticism rather than merely getting defensive.   <br />     My one serious criticism, and one that makes me much less optimistic than Diamond, is that Diamond does not deal with the degree to which hatred and conflict lead to environmental destruction.  It is very hard to get people to work together.  They'd rather fight.  Worst of all, and the most frequent cause of environmental mismanagement, is a situation where powerful special interests whip up strife deliberately, as a divide-and-conquer or divide-and-rule strategy.  This is terrifyingly visible in the United States, and elsewhere, today.  Judging from the world mess today, if humanity puts itself out of business through environmental suicide--which is indeed quite likely--the major cause will be politicians' exploitation of religious extremism.
0345452585|4.0|This was one of the best Jonathan Kellerman books I read in quite awhile.  Really good character developement and a plot that is laid out perfectly.  In past Kellerman books the detail of everything was too extreme for me at times.  Conspiracy Club didn't slow down due to details but keep a fast pace going at all times.  Looking forward to reading more from Kellerman.
1400031354|5.0|Continuing what was started in \\"The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency', Alexander McCall Smith once again creates another beautiful novel that is unfair to classify under a specific genre such as mystery. To do that would limit the scope of the book. Beyond the mystery or mysteries to be solved, this time revolving around an American woman searching for her long lost son, there is much political and social commentary which can be both humorous and touching depending on the circumstances. Told with a simple, direct style, Precious Ramotswe becomes even more endearing in this book, and her supporting cast of characters like her fiance Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, and her secretary Mme Makutsi,manage to root a place in your heart as well.

B00005N91B|2.0|*BASIC INSTINCT: Unrated Director's Cut*<br /><br />Wow, I don't remember this movie being so pornographic. I guess the Director's Cut, with the extra 5 minutes, is nothing more than extra porn. I remember it's what made Sharon Stone so popular? This would have made her a legend if it was released this way. From graphic oral sex(Michael on Sharon) to a near rape scene, this movie is just too much for me. The main story is great, with a great twist for an ending(or non-twist, depending on how you look at it) however, the graphic sex-scenes are just not neccessary and are way too overboard(I can't help but wonder if Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas are still proud of their work on this film?).<br /><br />Go ahead and call me prude, but I cannot recommend this filthy trash.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|And yet, go read the reviews. Where does RS get off, anyway? While there are some bad reviews, mostly by people who didn't have a clue as to just what this film was about, most were four and five stars. And the film is all about changing the past in order to make the future livable. Just where do you go and what do you change?  Hard stuff, which requires a lot of suffering until the right choices are made. Good film. Good acting, good story, good cinematography, good directing. If you don't understand it, well, that's not the fault of those who made the film. Whether or not we can seque into other dimensions is a question not yet answered by physicists; but in film we can. And what we can do if  this is possible is the question posed by this film. How in the world is  this one of the worst films of 2004? I think we are getting way, way, too critical of film and neither knowledgable  enough about the medium nor thoughtful enough about what we are seeing. Everything nowadays is bashed to pieces, and I for one am tired of it.I'm also very tired of people telling me what I should think. I liked Dodgeball, and Hidalgo, and any number of other films that are ranked \\"The Worst\\".  Read the reviews here, on Amazon, and find out that many, many watchers loved those \\"The Worst\\" films.  So much for professional critics.

0062502182|1.0|I bought this book while on a short cruise because it 1.) was short, 2.) looked to be a quick read, and 3.) was about Spain. The book did what I bought it for - kept my mind occupied for those times during the cruise when I wasn't doing anything.  <br /> <br />The story was predictable at best and the characters undeveloped. I didn't really care what happened to Santiago, the lead character. The story was trying too hard to be some big inspirational block-buster, but it just falls short of the mark.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a quick read to occupy your mind, this book might fill the bill. If you are looking for a well-written piece of literature, then look elsewhere.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Romantic movies these days tend to be cliched, unrealistic. They are filled with characters you do not believe in facing situations that would never happen in a million years. That's why it's so refreshing to see such a sweet, touching, realistic and simple movie like Before Sunset. <br /> <br />Following its first installment, Before Sunrise, Sunset picks up 10 years lafter that movie ended. These two characters, who had promised to meet each other at the end of Sunrise, never did actually follow through with their plans. Now Hawke has become a writer and is touring France. And Delpy just happens to go to one of his singings. <br /> <br />Love is still in the air and the characters decide to spend whatever's left of the day together (Hawke is schedule to return to America that very evening). As in Sunrise, they talk aobut nothing and everything; their dreams, regrets, their new lives... It seems that, although both of them have trudged along through the years, their lives have been incomplete without the other. Set in real time, we get to see the denouement of all those years of build-up sadness finally come to the surface.  <br /> <br />The film offers a surprise ending that is actually quite fitting for this film. Hawke and Delpy deliver the strongest performances of their careers; they look at ease and comfortable playing these characters. You just end up believing that they ARE these characters.  <br /> <br />Linklater knows how to develop characters and plot, and Before Sunset just comes to show the kind of magician that he is; there isn't a dull moment in Before Sunset. The whole movie just gets to you in the best of ways.
B0000AUHPK|2.0|I read the book and it was good enough but I'd hardly consider it one of the greatest loves of all time.  I thought perhaps since movies are more visual this might alter my opinion, but it did not.  I don't know why Cathy and Heathcliff are considered to have had such a grande tragic love.  I don't really understand the appeal of the Cathy character at all.  Why do the men in her life find her so irresistable?  She seems completely self-absorbed and brings most of her troubles on herself, and certainly doesn't exert herself to change any of the bad things that happen.  Also, this film seems to have really toned down the Cathy character.  In the book she was sort of fiery and volatile.  In this she's not much of anythng.  It drives me nuts.  Plus, Juliette Binoche who I ususally consider quite beautiful for some reason looked strange to me in this role.  Maybe her hair was too poofy, I don't know.  And I figured, epic love story, Ralph Fiennes will be dreamy, right?  But no.  He had bad hair, too.  So not much happening by way of eye candy.

I wanted to like Rio better than this cd but nothing tops this cd except U2's Achtung Baby. One track that i think is severely underated tho is a song called The Seventh Stranger. anyone who listens to the gem should definately check it out!!!
B000006045|5.0|There is little I could say that hasn't already been said about this album.  It is amazing how much this album has influenced the way I look at trip hop and music in general.  This album really is like the stars aligning for a brief moment of absolute clarity. <br /> <br />100th Window is good, and shows some additional maturity (although not nearly the kind of leap that happened between Blue Lines -- Protection -- and then Mezzanine).  But it certainly is no Mezzanine.   <br /> <br />Besides the obvious (Angel, Inertia Creeps), my vote goes for Disolved Girl and Black Milk.  (The drum loop at the end of the bridge in Disolved Girl is absolutely ridiculous! i.e. mesmerizing.) <br /> <br />One of the things that is so amazing is if you own it, you know what I mean.  And everyone you know who doesn't own it, you push it on them.  There are a few albums that I own that I tell my friends, \\"Buy it.  If you don't like it, I will buy it from you.\\"  (In case you're curious, Blackalicious' 'Nia' is another one).   <br /> <br />When this first came out, it was on everybody's top ten list.  Surprisingly enough, its still on a whole lot of them. <br /> <br />If you have never listened to any trip hop, buy this album and truly see for the first time.  It will change your understanding of music and what kind of perfection in simplicity is truly possible. <br /> <br />
B000005HLV|4.0|I must say that this is a great black metal album, Euronymous' great guitar work, slamming drums, eerie bass, but I don't really like Attila's vocals. Attila is not the worst black metal vocalist, but Dead fit the band much better and had a much more evil black metal voice. Aside from that, this was also Euronymous' last album before he was stabbed to death. This is Mayhem's best album as far as instrumental work, but not their best because of the vocals. Listen to \\"Live In Leipzig\\" and you will see what I mean.
B000002UAO|5.0|..to eric kent below. How can you dismiss the Beatles as archaic yet be a huge fan of the Beach Boys(an average band btw)? As Spock would say highly illogical. Should we also stop reading Shakespeare & Agatha Christie and forget about those ancients Mozart & Beethoven? Should we forget about Pet Sou..oop! maybe we should! Great art is timeless. The Beatles are timeless.  <br />HILARY CLINTON 42008!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles is the master and this is his masterwork. This cd is really a masterpiece and there's nothing else to say. The song with Norah Jones is amazing.  <br />Rest In Peace Ray Charles
B000002OZY|5.0|According to the film Almost Famous, if you sit in the dark, light a candle, and stare at it while you listen to Tommy, you will see  your future.  From the albums graceful, immense atmosphere, thankfully created by the four rock geniuses in the Who, you certainly can see some of the future of rock and roll.<br /><br />The Who is one of the most creative artists of the \\"classic rock\\" era...  and this album goes miles towards proving that as a fact.  Tommy is one of only a few rock operas to be produced (it is, in fact, the second by the Who, following Quadrophenia), and it does fit the general criteria of an opera... a story that is lyrical in nature.  Tommy tells the tale of a boy who is shattered by a traumatic experience and goes deaf, dumb, and blind, only to be discovered as a genius at playing pinball.<br /><br />It even feels like an opera, containing re-occuring themes and sweeping conceptual melodies throughout the piece.  It is a concept album, and it achieves masterfully.  Pete Townsend, John Entwistle, Roger Daltrey, and Keith Moon have created one of the greatest and most influential rock albums of all time, in my humble opinion, along the lines of The White Album, or Sgt. Pepper.<br /><br />Listen to it, maybe several times, to start to understand the underlying themes and content of the album... Even listening to it after the 10th time, I still find new moments and innovations within the music that makes me sit back and go \\"wow.\\"
B0001I55OC|3.0|I read the book before I knew they were making a film of this.  Now I do not read MC, in fact this was my first book by him I've read and it was good. I try never to read the book before the movie that way I usually enjoy both.  This movie is quite fun, it is well paced and for the most part I really liked everyone in it. I was a bit disapointed by Frances O'Conner she was a bit too girly but it was not too bad.  What I was most disapointed in was that I think it went too fast. Everything wrapped up just too quickly and the relationship between Merek and Claire just was sudden unlike in the book where they gradually grew to care for each other. The subplot of the abandoned traveller from the company that had made the machine was not at all developed as well as it should have been certainly not as menacing or as creepy as he was in the book. But becuase they changed the \\"timeline\\" (pun intended) from several days to only a few hours it all felt far too rushed and sometimes highly unlikely.  However unlike one reviewer who seemed to think the battle sequences badly contrived the battles/fights were actually extremely well done with acurate armor, fighting and real life work siege weapons. My BF is a total history nut about this stuff and was really impressed and happy with all the costumes and battle sequences.  But the cast was quite good and the film is still enjoyable. The extras are not a lot but are fun....the behind the scenes stuff being the best. Gerard Butler is such a clown and made us laugh with his goofing around behind R. Donners back in one sequence!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation is the type of story that you have to sit back and appreciate for the work or art it is.  This movie is so masterful in all of its respects, it almost defies explanation. Sofia Coppola is able to tell this story with an adept and skillful manner, so much so that you almost miss how wonderful it is from the get-go.  Sometimes it takes two viewings, to catch all of the nuances, the subtleties, the little pieces that make this movie great.<br /><br />It is the story of Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson)and their finding one another in the midst of the largest city in the world, Tokyo.  I won't go into plot details, as that is what the movie is about.  Instead, some thematics.<br /><br />The story revolves around lonliness.  The fact that this is the most populous city in the world, and these two Americans are without spouses, without friends goes to show that the lonliness is not mere physical distance, but emotional, cultural, almost spiritual.  And in the midst of their crises, these two find each other and bond together to help one another through their lonely times.  It is a tale also of finding yourself, getting yourself out of a rut, with their careers and marriages and life in general.  But, it is never too late, you can never be too alone, for breaking the cycle and trying something new.  Together they break-out, investigating Tokyo together and finding renewed viggor for their own lives.<br /><br />They are also together in a way that two people do not usually share.  Bob is old enough to be Charlotte's father, yet there is a bond there that is almost like love, but never really defined.  Something beyond friendship (as is evident when Bob sleeps with the lounge singer), but they never consumate their marriage physically, which is a relief.  Yet you can feel the connection between them, even when they are standing outside of a hotel at 3am during a fire alarm.  There is a bond there, something unique, wonderful as it is indescribable.  This relationship propels both of them forward into their lives, leaves them both smiling at the end of the movie.<br /><br />This is what has to be Bill Murray's best performance ever, Oscar-worthy if there ever was an acting role that deserved a golden statue.  What makes his role so beautifully poignant is that it is very subtle.  He doesn't cry a lot, he doesn't yell or scream, a lot of the time he doesn't even say much at all.  Yet it is in the way his body, his smile, his eyes, it is how these facets of his personality manifest the inner emotions that make the role great.  When he is shaving, and he holds up the tiny, plastic razor looking in the mirror, his face sums up his entire situation, without the need for words.<br /><br />Similarly, Scarlett Johansson is remarkable, also for her subtle way of portraying the quarter-life crisis Charlotte.  From her body language, the way she moves, or even just sits and looks out over Tokyo, evokes her mood and gives us a glimpse of her inner emotions, more-so than her husband can appreciate.<br /><br />This movie is very understated, and I feel underrated.  It gives just dazzling performances from two very talented actors, and it tells a tale that is wonderful as it is instructive and uplifting all the same time.  I whole-heartedly recommend this film to everyone, especailly if you are feeling a bit lonely.ful as it is indescribable.

0380789019|4.0|I read this book after reading Gaiman's AMERICAN GODS. I appreciate Gaiman's style and the homage that he pays to the roots of urban fantasy in his books. I did feel, however, that despite his skill he is missing something in the content of his fantasy, and that ultimately NEVERWHERE tries to do in one book and not enougth ink what Charles DeLint has done more effectively and more gradually in  several books. The story and characters squashed into NEVERWHERE could easily have made three or four interesting books if Gaiman had fleshed them out a little more. Gaiman paints an interesting underground London universe in NEVERWHERE and, while I enjoyed the book, I felt that it ended before I was satisfied. There's a lot more meat there, and Gaiman has only let his readers taste a few bites of it. Keep going... I think that Gaiman's urban fantasy could rival DeLint's if he kept at it--and it would be a more modern urban fantasy minus some of the celtic mumbo jumbo that DeLint seems to think so necessary.
B0002X314C|5.0|I had to write a review on this one because I can't stop jammin to it. I play in my car,at work and at home. This is really a really good debut ! I read the other reviews and honestly was expecting ALL positive reviews. I managed to find maybe 6 negative reviews and one of those was from a guy who admitted he hadn't heard the album. This cd has a very real soul feel to it and not many artist are putting that into their music of late. I just hate to read all of the comparisons to Donny,Stevie and the other great artists. Don't sleep on this guy ! He's really refreshing to R and B . I've come to the conclusion that the only people not feeling this cd are the ones that prefer commercial soul or the one's that don't know what soul music is about in the first place.
0804102988|2.0|I won't bother telling what this novel is about again as every other reviewer has done that.  As someone pointed out, there are boring tedious bits and some very interesting bits like the Black Death chapters and the long chapter that deals with Stonehenge.  Of the parts that are exciting, they do not seem to go on long enough, maybe 60 page chapters.  Then the boring legal chapters seem to go on for 200 pages.  I ask why?  What with all the intermarriages, it soon becomes very confusing.  And to make matters worse, you find one character you like and you want to know how their story is going to finish, you turn a page and you're on the next chapter and it's 80 years since the death of that person.  Not many individual stories are ever completed as such. <br /> <br />This is an Edward Rutherfurd book that I gave up on only 400 pages from the end.  I have read London and The Forest, and both of them are better than this one, just as long, especially London - but it doesn't seem to drag on endlessly about boring political and legal matters.  Unless you really enjoy historical political shaping, then there are better reads out there.
B000002U82|4.0|This album is one of epic status. No album used as much experimentation since. Each song has a different meaning  <br />to it that sends you on a travel that never seems to end. I recommend watching it with the Wizard of OZ. A true classic.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The title for best Rolling Stones album ever can be argued between Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile On Main Street.  For my money it's a dead heat between Bleed and Fingers. <br />The Stones most fertile creative period was from 1968-1972, starting with Beggars Banquet and ending with Exile On Main Street. (In the huge discography that followed, only 1978's Some Girls can be considered a true classic).  Let It Bleed was the second Stones album released during that period, although the largely countryish Beggars Banquet did little to prepare fans for this visionary album.  This was where the band fully realized the signature raunchy sound that has been such a huge influence (on Aerosmith and the Black Crowes to name a couple of the most obvious).  The lyrics were their most decadent yet, but the pervading feeling of decadence comes from the music.  Heck, if the subject matter of Midnight Rambler were changed to be about cycling in the park it would still give chills.  The opening of the album, the first bars of Gimme Shelter, are bright and melodic with some pretty Beach Boys-like harmonizing.  How cleverly deceptive as this is a precursor to a 42 minute ride of sex, drugs, and mayhem.   <br />Although the dark mood never really lets up, there's quite a bit of stylistic variance here, as is the case with most truly great albums. Love In Vain may be the best pure blues number the Stones ever recorded.  Country Honk and You Got the Silver continue their explorations into country - and provide some relief from the sonic assault of the songs that surround them.  And the opening of You Can't Always Get What You Want that follows the choir intro might be the prettiest melody they ever put on record.   <br />Prior to Beggars Banquet, the Rolling Stones were mostly a great singles band and deserved their status as second fiddle to the Beatles.  But after the disaster of Satanic Majesty's Request, they caught up fast and released some of the best rock albums ever.  35years on, Let It Bleed holds up exceptionally well and is one of the finest rock albums ever recorded.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Hurry up and buy this CD!  From beginning to end, it's absolutely fantastic.  Every single song.  Fantastic.  This CD stays in constant rotation on my iPod, especially at the gym.  It makes the time fly by.    I was never really all that gung-ho about Green Day.  I liked them OK - enough to not change the channel when they were on the radio, but not enough to ever buy their CDs.  They were a good band that I heard on the radio from time to time.  My world and opinion changed after seeing them live a few years ago.  NO ONE rocks out like GD in concert.    Man, have they gotten even better with age.  I am now the proud owner of my first Green Day CD, and it's so good that I regret not owning their previous albums sooner.  This CD rocks out and stay true to form throughout.  Truly exceptional.
B00007K02F|4.0|I love Jane Eyre, and this movie version I found to be very appealing. While it is not a strict adaptation, I feel it successfully brings the novel alive. William Hurt was excellant as Mr. Rochester and it was easy to see why Jane would fall in love with him. I also very much liked the actress that played Jane Eyre. She did look the age and looked plain and depressed (like I think anyone with Jane Eyre's life would look). The look of the film was also excellant. Anna Paquin as the young Jane Eyre was also an excellant choice. I prefer this version over the 1997 Samantha Morton version. That version Mr. Rochester is far from appealing, Jane is not so believable and it is hard to believe the two would have an attraction for each other. The 1997 version's Mr. Rochester is very ugly (uglier than I'd imagined Mr. Rochester), mean, rude and very demanding/commanding. He doesn't reflect a tortured soul, but rather a plain old grumpy and mean one and his portrayal of passion and attraction is rather poor. There were no sparks between the two, only poorly delivered lines. William Hurt, on the other hand, is able to portray both the sarcasm, wit, poor manners and inner turmoil of Mr. Rochester. He is also far more capable at portraying passion and love (as is the actress that plays Jane) than comparted to the 1997 Samantha Morton version. <br /> <br />I cared deeply for all of the main characters in this film and was able to connect with the story. I will be adding this film to my period romance collection.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble is, without equivocation, one of the finest male singers we've yet to see--period! He easily ranks up there with Sinatra, Harry Connick, Jr., Nat King Cole, and many more of the greatest ever! (Note, for newcomers: his last name is Buble with the accent on the last syllable, it's not pronounced \\"Bubble\\" as I MYSELF once thought when I was a newcomer to this man's work. hehehe GRIN)<br /><br />This album It's Time does not fail to disappoint! In my personal opinion, the title is a bit confusing, since HIS time to rise to stardom began a while back with his first CD (simply entitled \\"Michael Buble\\" from February 2003) and his performances.<br /><br />The album opens strong with \\"Feeling Good,\\" a great tune with a wonderful arrangement. Then comes \\"A Foggy Day (In London Town),\\" one of my personal favorites. Buble also does an awesome duet with Nelly Furtado on \\"Quando, Quando, Quando.\\" There is also a very interesting jazzy arrangement for The Beatles' \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\"<br /><br />With all these wonderful songs and terrific interpretations, I really have to stop and think before I tell you all what my favorite song on this CD is. Michael Buble truly emotes so well with ALL his songs! I suppose if I had to pick just one song I would have to go with \\"Save The Last Dance For Me.\\" It's so romantic; and Buble executes it flawlessly.<br /><br />This man's talent is truly rare and his positive reviews are much deserved! It's energizing to enjoy Michael's hard work and talent when he shares with us his singularly striking voice and interpretations to the classics. Tony Bennett, watch out! GRIN
B00005JNJ7|1.0|The problem with this film is not that Trey Parker and Matt Stone have taken a politically-incorrect stance in this film, that they attack popular entertainment figures, or that they are offensive and use stereotypes - these are all excusable with a good script. Sadly, contrary to everything said about this movie, the jokes are repetitive (think scene after scene of the same gags being wheeled out, puerile physical humour and bland, childish satire which misses the mark), and the puppets are poorly animated, often the source of \\"look how jerkily they move\\" comedy, which fails to impress. The problem with this movie is not that their understanding of world events is shallow and trite, and that they utterly miss the chance to make the audience think, or to use clever metaphor or satire, so much as that the jokes are universally bad. Worth watching only because it's popular and over-hyped; then to fight the corner of far funnier comedies which go unnoticed.
0385513755|5.0|I read this as a hardback, and when I saw it was offered with illustrations, ordered that too. I'm one of those that finds the facts revealed in this book fascinating. Whether what is revealed in this book is fabricated or truth, it's still interesting to consider and discuss with others. I like that Dan Brown set all this up within a mystery - my favorite genre - and the plot's fast pace.The beautiful illustrations are an additional bonus to what I consider one very good book.
B000067UUJ|5.0|I have two other cds by Muse, this is the one that I always find in my CD player. The B-sides are amazing and the concert is the next best thing to seeing them live (I have). If you don't own this CD and you love Muse just as much as me then you need to get it. NOW.
B00014NE62|4.0|In what must surely be a great milestone in the history of homosexuality and mainstream cinema, Maurice (James Wilby) is a young man coming to terms with being gay in Edwardian society. The rest of the excellent cast includes Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves, Denholm Elliot and Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, with exactly the production values we have come to expect of a Merchant-Ivory production, Maurice is an engaging film that touches on themes of sexuality, class and religion frankly, convincingly and with much poignancy. The central romance is handled movingly.<br /><br />DVD extras are pretty good: About half an hour of unused footage with an admittedly rather sparse commentary by director James Ivory; and a fairly interesting documentary featuring interviews with cast and crew.
0517530716|5.0|As a kid, Frankenstein (movies) never interested me. Then I saw a TV movie that told the story in a manner much more sympathetic to the creature - I think it was called 'Frankenstein - The Real Story.' I was moved by it, and intrigued by the contrast between it and the old Hollywood 'monster movies.' I'd like to have a copy of it.<br /><br />A few years later, I found this book on a clearance table. I fell in love with it. The annotations are absolutely fascinating.  I agree with the statement that it could easily serve as the text for a college-level course. What an interesting course that could be!<br /><br />In addition to addressing the deeper themes of Frankenstein, the annotations provides some serious speculation on the psyche of Mary Shelley as a motivator of the novel, a glimpse into the lives of the weird little Shelley/Byron clan with its own ideas about social relationships, and some personal experiences of Mary's that may have provided backdrops in the story. This deeply satisfying, provocative book led me to read a biography of Jane Williams, a woman the Shelleys knew who possibly had a fling with Percy Shelley; that book also reveals a lot about the world in which these people lived, particularly its impact on women of Jane and Mary's social class in that era.<br /><br />My original copy of Annotated Frankenstein got ruined - I nearly cried. That was several years ago, but I recently bought a nice used copy, and I am thrilled again. I'd love to read Wolf's books on Dracula, too - another fascinating horror story with lots of social implications. I read an annotated copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula - not as well-written as Wolf's, but still worthwhile; I had to see the movie with Gary Oldman as the Count. Marvelous!<br /><br />The Kenneth Branaugh 'Frankenstein' movie is well done, too. DeNiro's characterization of the Creature is superb. When that huge clodhopper sits down on a tree stump and sobs like a kid, well, there aren't many other actors today with that kind character insight. Reminded me of Charles Laughton as the Hunchback of Notre Dame. You can't imagine anyone else in the role.<br /><br />This wonderful book introduced me to a genre I'd never before explored, and led me to other very pleasurable reading.

0446310786|4.0|I was an English major and had never read some of the classics, such as this book is. So, I read it. I hate novels but found this text to be a delightful read. It is slow to get going but once you arrive at the courtroom scenes, it is all worth it. The characters are fun to get to know and the central message of the book is great. It is an easy book to read; thus, its prominence in high schools, and its a quick read too.  <br />Sometimes you read a novel and hope that there are some undertones present from which you can make some strong conclusions about what the author is trying to say. Some books fail at this entirely; this one doesn't. It is filled with subtle meaning and revelation. If you want to read a text that is simple to read and full of meaning, a true American classic, this is the one for you!
B0006GAI6Y|2.0|I enjoyed the Japanese original very much, so I was curious to see how this remake would turn out. I was disappointed. The original version was subtle - interesting things happening in the background, great characters.  The remake is not nuanced. Do Americans need to be hit over the head with a bat to understand things? Susan Sarandon's performance was very broad at times, almost a caricature. Jennifer Lopez seemed angry at the world, and it wasn't appealing. Richard Gere played Richard Gere.
B00005N7Z1|3.0|Before I rented this movie I looked it up in the movie guide.  It stated, \\"One word of warning; this is an extremely violent motion picture.\\"  Of course, I rented it.  I figured it wouldn't be too bad.  <br />    Next time I'll accept the warning. <br />After a Detroit cop(Peter Weller) is gunned down(in brutal Verhoeven style) he is combined with machine parts to become the ultimate cop.  Whew, and I thought Dirty Harry was dangerous!  I found this to be an interesting idea, perfect for a science-fiction film, and Weller does well with the part he is given.  Another plus for this movie was the acting of Kurtwood Smith as the main villain, who gives his character such an evil, mesmerizing personality that it's impossible to feel any sympathy for him.   <br />   Like many other movies, Robocop is good, but not great.  Personally, I just couldn't deal with the violence.  The scene of Weller getting shot up by Smith and his chums almost made me throw up, but the violence of that scene succeeded in getting the audience(me) to root for Robocop for the rest of the movie.  Director Paul Verhoeven also throws in several satirical punches aimed at the media and society in futuristic times, and they succeed for the most part.   <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|One of the best performers that I've ever seen live.  He's energetic and most importantly loves what he does. <br /> <br />It's Time completely exceeds the expectations he set when I saw him in concert.  If you like Frank, Dean, or Connick Jr. then you will love everything that Michael Buble does. <br /> <br />This CD has it all Salsa, Swing, Fox Trot, Waltz....   If you are dancer, you gotta have it.
B00005JN0T|4.0|To be perfectly honest with you, I went to this movie last summer completely convinced that I was wasting my money.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  <br />    When the president of a robotics company(James Cromwell) is found dead in his own lobby, supposedly from suicide, Will Smith's Detective Spooner is sent to investigate.  Using Isaac Asimov's story as a basis, the filmmakers took a typical whodunit motif and injected it with a sci-fi twist.  The futuristic setting is made more believable than most other science fiction movies I've seen, and the visual effects, although mainly constructed with the help of computer-enhanced technology, are quite good.  When these things are combined to make I, Robot, the results are very entertaining.   <br />
B000021Y7X|5.0|It may seem peculiar that Amazon users have rated Jonathon Demme's concert film featuring the Talking Heads higher than Schindler's List, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, and The Godfather, but I dare you to watch Stop Making Sense and not bestow accolades on it; whether a fan of the band or not, whether a fan of the music style or not, you will be hard-pressed not to come away from this film unimpressed.<br /><br />Other reviews have talked about the structure of the preformance, or the manic stage-presence of lead singer David Byrne, or the reluctantness of the director to focus on anything but the band.  All are good points, and certainly add to the movie's appeal, but I was more impressed with the music and high-energy of the Talking Heads themselves.  Although several years later the band would split, the performers in the film seem merely overjoyed to be on a band on a stage- making music and being cheered on by fans.  The musicans, from the guitairists to drummers to backup dancers, throw themselves into the music with a relentless zeal- with sweat dripping down their faces as they do dances which would seem ridiculous in any other band.  This energy and enthusiasm turn decent songs into great ones, making one want to watch the video over and over again, if only to see David Byrne run a lap around the stage to the tune of Life During Wartime.<br /><br />Well worth your money. 10/10
B000002NFM|3.0|The Prodigy's sound evloved in this album from previous efforts. This was the first of their albums to receive sustained critical acclamation. The music- or should that be, sound- is occasionally thrilling, as on Firestarter, Breathe and Serial thrilla. But other efforts such as Diesel power and smack my bitch up now sound dated and are rather one dimensional in their construction and lyrical message. Granted, this is an album intended for the dancefloor, but it contains tracks which transcend the dance genre and still provoke interest. As an album, The Fat of the Land is of mixed quality, however and there are tracks on there I won't listen to again.
B00002EPMF|5.0|The Fragile Art of Existence is renowned Death guitarist/singer Chuck Shuldiner's swan song to his fans before he lost his two-year battle against cancer in the end of 2001. Interestingly, Chuck was in the process of composing/recording his follow-up to this album, but unfortunately nothing has come of it. Control Denied was his side project which he had put together in order to concentrate more on his guitar playing and unique songwriting. Chuck does not do his trademarked death vocals on this one. Enter Tim Aymar (Psycho Scream, Pharaoh) with traditional Heavy Metal-like vocals that are often compared to the likes of Rob Halford, Warrel Dane and Bruce Dickinson. While I don't hear the Dickinson influence, I tend to agree with the Halford/Dane comparisons to an extent, as Tim Aymar belts out some scary high screams like Halford and possesses a similar delivery to Dane. You need to check out his band Pharaoh if you want to hear more of that. This album was originally intended to have Nevermore singer Warrel Dane on vocals, but things didn't work out and Tim Aymar got the gig. I love Warrel Dane's vocals to no end, but Tim Aymar really gives this album its final touch as a killer frontman.<br /><br />Shannon Hamm shares the guitar duties with Chuck, often playing cutting thrash-based riffs that sharply contrast Chuck's ethereal and textural playing which often spiral into crushing metal riffage during the solos and mid-sections of the tunes. Both guitarists interlock thrashy riffs alongside some curious tremelo picking and even add some plucked acoustic guitars (\\"When the Link Becomes Missing\\") which are later embraced by a forceful, melodic metal drive. The solo in this song is possibly my favourite on the album together with Chuck's textural playing in the closing track. It's a solo that builds up very slowly and becomes this intense, passionate expression towards the end -- it simply sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it. Steve DiGiorgio and Richard Christy continue to be an unmatchable duo in thrash/death metal driven music as DiGiorgio plays fat bass figures as well as interesting funky melodies, as in the intro of \\"What If ...?\\", and works his bass as an independent instrument throughout the whole album. Richard Christy is a great fit for this type of music, though I feel his snare sound gets a little muffled in some parts because of the mix, but he proves to be the perfect drummer for Control Denied in the way he exhibits powerful synchopated rhythms and technically impossible drum fills.<br /><br />What makes The Fragile Art of Existence so great, in my opinion, is that it consists of only eight tracks and has a total running time of 50 minutes. There are no fillers here; each song is compositionally-strong, graced by brilliant musicianship and a fitting production (by Chuck and Jim Morris). The progressive side explored on Death's last album, The Sound of Perseverance, is even more boldly carried over to this album, particularly in the multi-textured \\"Expect the Unexpected\\", which not only has a great vocal melody, but also features various harmony changes. The centrepieces of the album, \\"What If ....?\\" and \\"When the Link Becomes Missing\\" are both thrash-rooted progressive songs in the way that allow Chuck to play textural guitars that fiercely contrast the otherwise heavy music, mainly driven by Hamm and DiGiorgio. This is further explored in the almost 10-minute epic, \\"The Fragile Art of Existence\\", which is Chuck's testament to stylistic cohesion and passionate songwriting. Three minutes into the song, Aymar coldly utters the words \\"NO TIME FOR SELF-PITY\\" and the textured guitar riffs are suddenly replaced by tasty guitar shred before giving way to the initial atmospheric guitar themes.<br /><br />Chuck's lyrics on this one are perhaps his most introspective and personal lyrics (hence he chose a different project that would separate his musical vision from Death) and Travis Smith comes up with a very fitting artwork. The album is mixed, engineered and mastered by Jim Morris and co-produced by Chuck himself. If you're a metal fan, be it thrash, heavy or prog, and don't own this, then your collection is incomplete.ery fitting artwork.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Although I will never watch it again, I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie.  It accurately portrays Jesus' last tortured hours on planet earth.  I give kudos to Gibson, who was brave enough to finance this movie himself, amidst much controversy.  I would encourage all to watch this movie, at least one time, to understand why throughout the ages, thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ. <br /> <br />Yes, this movie is violent, but this world is violent, and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world, but to share in our sufferings.
B00000IMTG|3.0|I give this album three stars because it's still Rainbow, but this record is week, indeed. You'll be excited with the funny introduction featuring a playback of Dorothy saying \\"We must be over the rainbow\\", ripped off The Wizard Of Oz. <br /> <br />The band's energy and sounding is pretty good and everything goes very well until they start to jam way too much, up to the point when it gets really really boring, sometimes you'll be able to hear even more silence than any sound at all. <br /> <br />Still worthy, but definitely not for starters. Don't make this one your first Rainbow record and then start going around and saying that you hate the band, try a real studio album first. And if you already have all of the Dio era studio albums and just want another Rainbow record, get Stranger In Us All before this one, it's surely the best Rainbow album without Dio.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|\\"Under My Skin\\" was no doubt better than the debut \\"Let Go\\", but still, nothing screaming out of the ordinary is to be found here.  It's a bit of a more sophisticated extention to \\"Let Go\\", rather than being far superior or anything of that nature.   <br /> <br />However songs like \\"Freak Out\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\", and \\"He Wasn't\\" are obvious echoes of the young girl's earlier years, while other songs like \\"How Does It Feel\\", \\"Slipped Away\\", and \\"Nobody's Home\\", do make you see a difference in the styles, in a 'coming of age' sort of way.  So its hard to say what exactly makes it worthwhile all around.  However it is a good cd and a must have for any Avril fan.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Even if you didn't know \\"American Idiot\\" was a rock opera, it would be obvious that Green Day was trying something different on their new album. Everything from the chanting of \\"Are we, we are\\" in \\"We Are the Waiting\\" to the five-part suites of \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" suggest that they are aiming for more then your everyday album-even the opening track, \\"American Idiot\\",  gives off the vibe of an opening number; the chorus could almost be a scrapped song idea from \\"Rent\\". <br /> <br />But \\"American Idiot\\" is no experimental, arty album. It is as catchy an album as you'll find this year. The title track is classic Green Day-the pop/punk that they've been known for since they exploded onto the scene with \\"Dookie\\" a decade ago, often imitated, rarely duplicated. However, much of the rest of the album explores new ground. Probably the best track on the album, \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is as good a song of being spiritually lost as has come along in recent years, while \\"Wake me up Before September Ends\\", an ode to the death of innocence,  is probably more compellingly sad then a Green Day song has the right to be.  <br /> <br />The three centerpieces of the album are \\"Letterbomb\\", with its grade-school chant of \\"Nobody likes you, everyone left you\\" and the suites, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\". They all come together to paint a picture of disillusionment, arrogance, boredom, and apathy. Sociopolitical statement, rock opera, or just good music, \\"American Idiot\\" is a breath of fresh air: accessible music full of emotion and meaning. Quite probably the culmination of their career.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|It's Time is brilliant! Buble has once again captured the music with his smooth style and tone and stamped his signature on each and every track. You'll experience a listening treat and be floored by this man's talent, both as a singer and as a song writer with his own penned 'Home'. Home is a song for all ages and with my man serving in our military has such meaning to me. <br />The duet with Nelly Furtado on Quando Quando is incredible - a must listen to over and over. <br />The Beatles Can't Buy me Love is fun and upbeat, Save the Last Dance will have you singing along and overall it just doesn't get any better than this. It's Time for Michael Buble to shine again!
B000002WPI|5.0|This cats may not have had a whole lot of substance and positivity for this LP, but dammit, they knew how to put together a complete, nearly infallable album though! While these 9 MC's may be lacking in morals and decency, they all are overflowing with TECHNIQUE and relentless energy. RZA produced this masterfully. It may be minimal, but emphasized the drums and even some piano on many of the tracks. So many production highlights, one that I can think of right now would be #6, \\"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'.\\"  Just pop this cd in and let it BANG! RZA actually slows down the pace effectively on tracks like \\"Can It Be All So Simple,\\" and \\"Tearz,\\" and even \\"C.R.E.A.M.,\\" and the album still flows so effortlessly. Everything on this album is just soooo good, and they were smart not to barrage us with an overabundance of tracks. That would've weakened the overall product! Even the second version of \\"Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber\\" was essential and you may not even notice that that song was already included at first, since the beat is different(and even better I think).  Even with the abundance of skits and interludes, it doesn't seem excessive. It helps you get a feel for these MC's who were on some different sh%t. They may have been heavy on the violence, profanity, and braggadocio, but they all seem intelligent and just feed it to you RAW.  My personal favorites were joints like \\"C.R.E.A.M.,\\" \\"Da Mystery of Chessboxin',\\" \\"Protect Ya Neck,\\" \\"Bring Da (mf'in) Ruckus,\\" and especially Gza's \\"Clan In Da Front.\\" But like I said, it's all good, it's all good! They all ripped it, but you could tell that cats like Raekwon, Ghostface, Gza, and even Ol' Dirty and Method Man were gonna blow up. Method Man even had a solid solo track on here, much better than the stuff he does nowadays, and although it's not a standout, it more than keeps the flow of the album moving. I wouldn't have a newcomer to Hiphop start out here, because you SHOULD have to be a knowledgable and experienced Hiphop listenerto appreciate the rawness and technique displayed here. Actually, this Wu-Tang debut is one of my favorite albums that I've bought in quite some time. This ain't an album that's going to enrich your life or be appropriate for the whole family, but it's strictly for those true Hiphop listeners out there who can recognize microphone and production mastery when they hear it!
B00030590I|4.0|Monday, February 07, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Sumptuous imagery but somewhat lacking in substance.<br /><br />Hero tells the disjointed tale of a nameless warrior who is granted an audience with the future ruler of China.  The warrior claims to have vanquished three assassins who have plagued the royal household for years.  Through a variety of flashbacks we view the different angles of the story as told to the King until it is completely at odds with what was originally expected.  Compared to Crouching Tiger this film lacks the epic scope and humanistic sweep.  It tries too hard to be attractive.  There are moments of sumptuous beauty as the fights are framed and CG effects are poured in.  The wire work is great and the color palettes change in dramatic fashion with the combatants.  The film asks the viewer to make a lot of logical jumps for the purpose of plot advancement, and to embrace fully its eventual coda.  I wasn't quite ready to do that, but that didn't hinder me from enjoying the ride.

067144901X|5.0|My oldest son received this book on his first birthday as part of a set of Boyton books (each of them wonderful in their own way).  However, this book stood out from the rest and 'Moo Baa La la la' has become an absolute classic story in our home.<br /><br />How many times did I read it to him?  Well, let's just say I will begrdugingly admit to having hid this book in the sofa cushions more than once just to get a break!<br /><br />My oldest son is almost 11 years old now and I can still recite the entire book from memory.  I'm also proud to say that my urges to hide it for a reprieve are now past and I can cherish the memory of my sweet little wide-eyed boy anxiously waiting for me to ask him the grand finale question, \\"What do YOU say?\\"<br /><br />If you'd like to help build fond memories, share humor and expand a young mind, give this book to any child, parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle or parent-to-be.
B0000844I8|5.0|The five stars are for the movie itself and the original \\"Ultimate Edition.\\"<br /><br />I bought my original edition in February 2003 and got the one with the gold foil embossed slip case, 2 disks with both the extended version and the theatrical version of the movie.  Since then, even though almost every e-tailer and retailer show that the Ultimate Edition with 2 disks and two versions of the movie, they do not actually have them to ship.  I have ordered from several e-tailers and the keep cases show \\"Extended Cut\\" on the bottom of the front case label and not \\"Director's Cut,\\" they do not have all of the featurettes any more or many of the other extras.<br /><br />I feel the manufacturer has deluded all of their clients who sell these DVDs by NOT changing the name of the DVD.  It should not say \\"Ultimate Edition\\" when it is not the Ultimate Edition.<br /><br />I don't think Amazon was trying to cheat or fool their buyers and finally have a note in their Editorial Review that the current release is a \\"stripped down\\" version - only one version of the movie and fewer extra features.

B00005QDW5|5.0|I've listened to Pink Floyd off and on since my teen years, but was always somewhat intimidated and sometimes just uncomfortable with their dark songs and lyrics.  Now that I'm older I have learned to appreciate the genius that was in abundance in this band.  In this collection you get an excellent sampling of songs that have gone a long way towards defining Pink Floyd, including 5 Syd Barrett tracks.  I'd already purchased The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish You Were Here and I think now I'm more motivated to continue buying more from this excellent band.  Highly recommended! <br />

0312995423|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have not yet gotten around to reading The Da Vinci Code, also from Dan Brown- I do own it, I just haven't gotten around to reading it yet. Digital Fortress however piqued my interest because it related directly to computer and network security. Brown certainly does his homework as it relates to computer security technology and talks intelligently about encryption algorithms. The crux of this story revolves around a new encryption algorithm which, even with a relatively small key, is completely unbreakable. I found the book fast-paced and engaging. I almost literally didn't put it down until I was done. I don't take many forays into the world of fiction, but if you like cyber-thrillers I highly recommend you pick this book up and read it.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Don't listen to these bad reviews!These guys are just A band!Why expect anything from two great bands merging like this.I say with gifted artists like this coming together you can't lose.Some say it did'nt meet their expectations or it is  too \\"commercial sounding\\" but maybe they just don't understand the trip these guys are going for.Either way,this is just good artists expressing themselves whether they did it for the money or not.If you like soundgarden and/or R.A.T.M then just buy it!
1591396190|5.0|Over the years, I have with the greatest interest followed professors Kim & Mauborgne's strategy development ideas in several HBR-articles, during their seminars, as a practitioner of the BOS concept and as a member of their Value Innovation Network. There book \\"Blue Ocean Strategy - How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant\\" is a milestone not only in business strategy, but also in management literature as a whole. I strongly believe that the Blue Ocean Strategy concept already has created a new platform for future strategy development and execution - both in research and for practitioners of strategy development and execution. The Blue Ocean Strategy book should be on every manager's desk!  <br /> <br />A very strong point with this book is the fact that it covers both the conceptual level of creating blue oceans as well as a proven methodology and a set of analytical tools for creating and executing the Blue Ocean Strategy. There are some good examples of blue ocean companies today, but in the past there has not been any proven methodology that companies can use in practice.   <br /> <br />Blue Ocean Strategy focuses on creating new market space and inventing new industries from so far unmet value of buyers - and not from analysing the competition like companies in Red Oceans. Furthermore, it focuses on delivering product & services at lower costs by simultaneously considering differentiation and low cost.  <br /> <br />A cornerstone in Blue Ocean Strategy is Value Innovation with its Strategy canvas, Value curves and Six paths framework. Those analytical tools, tools that also are useful in the idea creation mode, have proven to be very practical, structured and easy to understand for clients - and challenging to management teams as they force management to break out of the box and stop \\"following\\" competition and instead create unique value propositions.  <br /> <br />Except for the strong methodology and analytical tools, I dofind Kim & Mauborgne's research very interesting as regards profit and growth consequences of creating blue oceans. They found that only 14% of today's business launches are blue oceans but they generated 38% of total revenues and 61% of total profits! So there are massive line extensions out there that in fact create losses and no or limited value to buyers. Furthermore it is interesting to observe that a blue ocean company keeps its strong brand even if former competitors or new entrants are trying to copy the quantum leap in buyer value and the push for a sharp drop in the industry's cost structure. <br /> <br />I recommend all managers to read the book, consider what's in it for us and apply the analytical framework. Welcome to a new world of strategy development and execution - Welcome to Blue Ocean Strategy!  <br />
B00004VVND|5.0|I love this film. Strangely enough, Andromeda Strain is also in my top 5. I can watch these movies over and over. Brolin and Benjamin are teriffic in this film. Its amusing to see Benjamin in a role like this after you have seen him in Catch 22. Also a top 5 film. LOL It must have been so much fun making this film. LEt me say that Yul Brynner completely steals the film. He is such a presence. True, he does not have many lines, but it is all in his expressions. His subtle reactions are brilliant. The glint he gets in his eyes is also priceless. He was a truly gifted actor, and he is sorely missed. I find myself rooting for him in this, but he always gets the acid in the face and set on fire at the end. LOL So much for alternative endings. I hear rumors that they want to remake this. This disgusts me. They completely destroyed Stepford Wives, and turned it into a mockery. The original was frightening. This was a pile of jokey politically correct crap. Hollywood sucked out its soul, and they will do the same to Westworld. This is very difficult to find nowadays, and I actually found a DVD copy at a Sam Goody. Renting it can also be frustrating. My Blockbuster and Hollywood video didnt have it, and the clerks didnt even know what it was. I should have smacked them. Grab this. Treasure it.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Yes, you can have all the  Paranoids and Master of Realities you want, but I'll take Sabotage as I feel this LP was Sabbath's finest hour. I still remember buying it in 1975 and for the first time seeing a clear picture of the band. My first thought was these guys all look demented (except Iommi, who kinda looked like my dad!!!). I slipped the LP onto the turntable and after a second or so cranking it way up thinking it was defective. Suddenly I heard a count-off and BAMMMMMM!!! Tony Iommi's opening riff to Hole in the Sky pounded me into submission. I became an instant metalhead that day as I listened to the album and it's relentlessness. There was no compromise to any of it. If they were going for hard hitting (Hole, and Symptom of the Universe), it slammed you to the ground, if they were going for dark and moody (the Writ, Megalomania), the room seemed instantly shrouded in darkness.   There is not a bad song on this record, even Sabbath's stab at commercial viability (hell, they even admit it in the title!?!) Am I Going Insane? is a brillant piece of music.   In my opinion no other LP from Mark I Sabbath showed the level of creativity Sabotage had, and when I listen to the album before it(Sabbath Bloody Sabbath)or the album after it (Technical Ecstasy) the one question that comes to mind is where did this come from? There is simply no other Sabbath LP like it!!!  I guess the true power of this LP was shown to me about 2 years ago. I had the CD with me at a friends house. This friend was very into progressive music (Yes, Dream Theater, Flower Kings and stuff like that). I slipped the CD in while he wasn't paying attention and though he knew the band from Paranoid and War Pigs, he had never heard Sabotage before. He sat mesmerized as we played it from start to finish. I went over to his house a week or so later, and guess what new CD he had purchased?

B000023VR6|5.0|so it was 1999.rap had hit a standstill, with filler tracks and shallow songs hitting the airwaves and being taken with a grain of salt.all it took was for dr. dre to return full throttle with this, his first album since 1992's masterpiece, \\"the chronic\\".dr. dre proves why he is one of the best in the business, and sticks to his roots while incorporating some of the new modern styles.\\"still DRE\\" is probably one of my favorite rap tracks of all time.the piano strumming in the background with the really catchy choruses and pre's sticking to my brain with each listen.\\"next episode\\" has a really heavy downbeat with a catchy \\"ladidadida\\" thrown in for good measure.\\"forgot about dre\\" was heard throughout the world and beyond, and adding eminem was a good touch.it was overplayed, but to listen to it every now and again makes it taste better.\\"murder ink\\" has an eerie background effect going on with some female vocals involved.this album does it all and covers all the bases.rap has since gone further downward toward meltdown and beyond, but \\"the chronic 2001\\" offers a shimmer of hope in a world drowned by escalades, crystahl, and whatever other superficial topics \\"rappers\\" today ramble about-DRE DONE PUT YOU TO SHAME.
B00005ASOI|1.0|Well, at the risk of coming off as stupid, I can't for the life <br />of me see what is so great and scary about this movie.

The best thing either of us had to <br />say about it was, \\"Thank God we never have to watch it again\\"! <br />I own over 700 horror flicks, and have to say that this is one <br />of the most unentertaining, and least shocking or scary of them <br />all. But then again, most other reviewers think it is great. I <br />bought the DVD based on those reviews. <br />???  <br />Tom
1577314808|5.0|Now is the only moment that ever is. The past and the future are both just concepts of physical consciousness. In reality, everything occurs now, only from different points of view. Eckhart Tolle provides a compendium of what living in the now really means. Only by being in the now, can you gain control of your life. The regrets of the past and the hopes of the future are all outside of your immediate control. By identifying with the eternal now, you gain the ability to address the challenges which face you now, and to become who you really are, in the now.

068987474X|1.0|This book is condescending to anyone in a relationship! If a guy doesn't call or something don't give up on him! I mean, sure if there is nothing there you shouldn't dwell on what might have been!    But this book is hypocritical. I think if everyone read this book and takes the advice than your relationship will be over like that! No relationship will be perfect- so don't expect it to be... The author implys that all men will chase after the girl of there affection. In most cases this isn't true, so he can speak for himself, not for all of his race! There has to be some reaction/interaction/flirting from the girl.     Why give up so easy? Why not put any effort into your relationship?    If you get this book don't take it seriously. Just laugh, like I did!    I'm not in a denial, but I know that guys can be shy and that this book is chock-full of insults and elementary biased opinions, based on one guy who thought he ruled the world.    This guy must have a ego completely born out of proportion to think that his ignorant opinion represents millions out there.    I don't even understand some of the context of this book.   This book is so frustrating I think I will burn it! Please join me...     The only reason I can explain the publication of this book is propaganda for money. I can't think of any other legitimite reason for this nightmare to be published!

B00005MP58|5.0|The two disk (Parts One and Two ) DVD version  I  have obtained is a full screen version (1.33.1) distributed by Lambrakis Group Publishing in Athens. It is with Greek sub-titles than can be removed but without any supplementary material. I have not had the problem related by other reviewers with the color or the sound , which are superb. I don't think this kind of  made-for-TV movie would benefit from a widescreen version in any case. In the best BBC   tradition this version of Pride and Prejudice is excellent both as regards to the quality of production and the careful casting.  The props,  period costumes, and settings are  outstanding. Colin Firth has the same sulky look as  in  his role as a cuckolded fiance in Shakespeare in Love. It is  a pleasure to  view  a product of this  high quality.
B0006399FS|1.0|This mistake is extremely boring and meaningless. Bono is extremely annoying here, unlistenable. This album is the perfect example of how... can save a music lover fromwasting money on over-rated trash.     This sellout U2 doesn't deserve the colossal amount of hype it has been getting. Anyone who would call \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It\\" a 'deep song' has absolutely no credibility to judge music... it's probably the most clich U2 song ever, possibly tied with \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Crumbs For Your Table\\". What horrible pick for a band's second single!. If you want to listen to a brilliant song related to a father's death, listen to Pink Floyd \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\" instead. Video Clip is even worse and more clich, with all those silly shots at the Opera theatre.    They've somehow menaced their way onto the charts and remained, selling their faceless wan. They music sounds so plastic, unimpressive, worthless and commercial that gives me urge to go to the first restroom out there, really. Incredibly unoriginal and predictable, this is the worst U2 album, and the most overhyped as well. All songs sound too similar ( by the way, the whole same ATYCLB sound ). Not even decent songwriting, this soup is just low quality pap for the bucks.     U2 have become no more than a mainstream music corporation. I can't believe these are the same men whom used to take white flags to their early concerts. Yet some stupid fans say this half-worked Ipod product is a 'return to their roots'. I bet you young Bono would hate this sellout faceless Ipod man.
B000001AFY|5.0|By 1976 Soul Diva Diana Ross had a river of No.1 hit titles, Movies, Television Specials and spectacular Concerts to her credit.  <br /> <br />However Ross hadn't had a major chart hit since 1973's divine classic, Touch Me In The Morning. Black music was steering into different directions with Soul music divulging into Disco and in some aspects Ross' recording career had lost course.  <br /> <br />That changed in 1975 when the classic Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To) catapulted to the top of the charts. This epic ballad with its sweeping musical arrangements and an almost dreamy yet compelling performance from Ross was written and produced by the genius Michael Masser. The track really is a masterpiece and that classic interlude at the climax of the song is breathtaking. For some odd reason, Theme From Mahogany was not nominated for a Grammy Award despite its cross-Atlantic success though after strong protest it was deservedly added yet still failed to win. Even so, Theme From Mahogany rightfully remains one of Ross' key classics and became the opening number on this excellent 1976 studio LP.  <br /> <br />Diana Ross had an uncanny and effortless flair for ballads and nobody could quite convey such warmth and genuine emotion as she could. I Thought It Took A Little Time (But Today I Fell In Love) is another example of her unique expertise. This exotic and exalting ballad is enhanced by Ross' delicate but effective vocal performance and was written and produced by Michael Masser. The track surprisingly faltered within the lower reaches of the Top 40, probably as promotional priorities were suddenly turned to the albums next release, Love Hangover.  <br /> <br />Love Hangover was quickly covered by The Fifth Dimension and issued as a single. Motown was certainly not going to let anyone outshine their leading lady and predictably rushed out Ross' version.  <br /> <br />This exciting, tempo-shifting Disco classic saw Ross effectivley updating hersound. Never before had Ross sounded so adventurous as on Love Hangover. The track, written by Pam Sawyer and Marilyn McLeod and produced by Hal Davis (who she had worked with on her Everything Is Everything album), began in slow, sultry form, a style Ross had become accustomed to over the past few years and then wildly steers direction into red hot, compelling Disco/Funk. Ross sounds almost stark at some points in the recording even delivering a brief impersonation of legendary Jazz vocalist Billie Holiday at one point. That sort of spontaneity was what made Love hangover become one of the definitive Soul/Disco classics of the decade. Love Hangover zoomed into pole position on the charts, subsequently leaving The Fifth Dimensions less ambitious version hovering down the bottom end of the Top 100 BillBoard Charts.  <br /> <br />Kiss Me Now, written by Gwen Gordy and Kenneth Lupper and produced by Motown boss Berry Gordy and Don Costa, is a silly but fun playful Jazz number where she even goes so far as to deliver a brief mimmick of Louis Armstrong at one point.  <br /> <br />What makes this album stand out from a lot of her others of the 70's is that contains a cool blend of sounds and textures and the second half gets even better.  <br /> <br />The soulful You're Good My Child stands as the best of the album tracks. Containing undertones of soft-Funk with a gentle piano backdrop and a warm Reggae beat, this startling number features Ross delivering a rich and compelling performance. You're Good My Child went onto become the flip side of her next hit single, One Love In A Lifetime.  <br /> <br />One Love In A Lifetime is perharps in a way no more than a contemporary updating of her sound and style with The Supremes though the track is instantly infectious despite lacking the initial immediacy of Love Hangover. One Love In A Lifetime jumped to No.25 on the BillBoard Charts though bombed in the U.K.  <br /> <br />Her cover of Ashford and Simpsons Ain't Nothin' But A Maybe, a track she produced herself, has a sassy and sexually charged performance from Ross but once again her flair for ballads is displayed on another gorgeous Michael Masser compostion, After You, where she sparkles too full effect.  <br /> <br />The album then closes on a surprisingly unique version of Smile to which Ross excels herself, delivering a strong, passionate performance. Produced and arranged by Gil Askey (who had worked with Ross on several projects including the soundtrack to Lady Sings The Blues), Smile does show Ross' rather understated and over-looked versatility.  <br /> <br />The Diana Ross album gels nicely together, partly as more effort seemed to be put into it than some of her other studio efforts where some like Last Time I Saw Him (1973) were flawed by mediocre \\"filler\\" and B-sides. This pleasing effort from Ross was actually conceived as a full studio project. Released in February 1976, this classy soul package became one of Ross' best sellers of the 70's, jumping into the Top 5 Albums Charts on both sides of the Atlantic as well as deservedly winning many favourable reviews from critics of the day.  <br /> <br /> <br />Ian Phillips  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|My first contact with Keane came via Boston's WFNX playing \\"Somwhere Only We Know.\\"  I thought it was a great song, but, upon seeing Keane live on TV, the lead singer's awkward appearance kind of turned me off.  I figured, \\"New sound, intersting music, most definite one-ht wonder.\\" <br /> <br />WRONG! <br /> <br />I bought the CD anyway, and by the 2nd track I found that this was clearly not a one-hit CD.  By track 5 I was IN LOVE with the album.  It seems I simply misinterpreted the band's awkward on stage appearance.  I saw the awkwardness as a hinderance, whereas it probably should be a credit.  The band has been able to make it big without relying on charisma.  They must, then, have had to rely on their talent. <br /> <br />This album exudes a sense of completeness and coherence that I haven't heard since Bright Eyes' \\"Lifted.\\"  As a people, we have become too comfortable with sloppy albums.  Sure, a great number of albums produce multiple hits, but very few lend any sense that the album is anything more than a collection of songs.  Keane's \\"Hopes and Dreams\\" does just that.  It's like a good novel instead of a good collection of short stories, and by the end you won't be able to help wanting to start it again.
1881273156|5.0|I had the opportunity to learn Gary Chapman's Five Love Languages in a seminar that I went to regarding the family.  This is wonderful information that actually is practical and opens the door for both learning to give to each other 100%, not only that, but giving 100% to the others language of love.<br /><br />Learing love languages is actually fun.  Relating to each others language of love is even more exciting.  Once you learn whether your spouse loves touch or gifts, or even loves conversation, you will open new avenues for intimacy and closeness.<br /><br />I think Gary Chapman has found a solution to the problem of continued closeness in a marriage.  Learn and apply the language of love and grow closer together.
044651652X|5.0|I know that this story is too romantic and unrealistic for some people. However,I still think many people ever have experienced it.  <br />In sum, everyone want to know what is \\"real love\\" should read it, and this book will help you to think it over.
0226264211|1.0|If you accept Friedman's underlying assumptions his arguments seem logical.  If you open your mind it's easy to take apart some of his suppositions and the rest of the book becomes a joke. It's important to examine this first point carefully because many of his assumptions later in the book rest on this point.<br /><br />-One of my favorite arguments in this book (because it is so ridiculous) is the idea that capitalism is free because all exchanges or relationships made through the market are voluntary and benefit all parties involved.<br /><br />  As an example Friedman claims that if you work for a corporation it is a voluntary contract because if you didn't want to work for a corporation, you can just produce directly for yourself.  Almost no one has the resources to do this.  90% of small businesses fail within the first few years.  And why do 90% of small businesses fail? Because they have to compete with gigantic corporations who have 100,000's of times more resources (money, productive facilites, etc) and so can produce goods and services at a much cheaper rate and therefore put small businesses under. So what happens to that 90%, that tried to produce for themselves but failed? They are forced to sell their lives away, 8 (or more) hours a day.<br /><br />  Clearly, most people don't have a choice.  If I don't work for a corporation (where I'll have to take orders and abuse from my bosses, do repetitve mind numbing tasks or physical labor that will end up shortening my life), then my family and I starve to death.  So when I work for a corporation, it's not because that's where I want to work, its because i'm forced to. I'll be faced with a form of physical violence (starvation) if I choose otherwise.<br /><br />  Some of you may be saying 'so what?', we're forced by violence to work for a corporation?  Even if a corporation was a wonderful place to work where you didn't have to take orders and abuse from your boss, capitalism still restricts freedom because it FORCES us to work there.  It forces us to take orders from other people.<br /><br />There are alternative ways of running an economy that allow for democracy and freedom, and that resemble neither Capitalism nor Communism. For more info, google \\"Participatory Economy\\" or \\"ParEcon\\".<br /><br />-Friedman compares how both Capitalism and Communism can take away political liberty.  He uses McCarthyism and the Blacklisting in the movie industry to demonstrate how capitalism will preserve freedom.  He claims that even though these people had to go into hiding and weren't allowed to publish their work, at least they could find other jobs, which couldn't happen if there was no market. He then argues that eventually these people were allowed to make films again, and thus he says, when capitalism takes away freedom, at least it is not prohibitive.<br /><br />  Freidman misses the point here.  Freedom to Friedman, only means economic freedom.  Note that he claims that even though their political freedom to express themselves was taken away, at least  they had the economic freedom to find a job.  Here he is arguing that econmic and political freedom are one in the same, and they are obviously not. I'm sure the directors of these films felt very much prohibited.  How elitist of Friedman to claim otherwise: he does not know how it feels to be severely censored as they were.<br /><br />  Capitalism does allow for political freedom at times. But when there is a crisis, when the capitalist system is threatened by a competing ideology, it will always use force to restrict speech.  McCarthyism is just one example of this.  Around the world, capitalism has always restricted free speech, but only when the elites in any country have been threatened.  You could look at any Latin American country's history for an example (Pinochet's coup, as one example- when an attempt at socialism AND democracy was being made).it FORCES us to work there.

B00005OM4N|5.0|In my opinion, Britney shines on this cd. Still, she really can't sing, but great production makes up for that. With help from The Neptunes, Justin Timberlake, Wade Robson, and others, Britney has managed to step into a more adult kind of style. <br /> <br />My Favorite Tracks: <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U: Great and extremely catchy. Why I wanted this cd in the first place. Produced by the Neptunes. <br />OVERPROTECTED: This song is great and in my opinion the best song on the cd. <br />LONELY: Great song, beat. Along the lines of Stronger from Oops... <br />CINDERELLA: I absolutely love this song. I like the vocal production. Ties with OVERPROTECTED. <br />BOMBASTIC LOVE: Taking it back to the old days. <br />WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME: This song is rather short, but I like it anyway. It was produced and written by Wade Robson and Justin Timberlake. Justin sings in thebackground, but is not featured because it is basically just background singing. I love it. Ties with OVERPROTECTED and CINDERELLA. <br /> <br />Downsides: <br />ANTICIPATING: Rather annoying vocals. <br />I LOVE ROCK N ROLL: A very bad cover. <br />LET ME BE: I just really don't like it. <br /> <br />So, if you want any Britney Spears cd, get this one.
B000683VI4|5.0|Let me start off by saying I'm not a fan of this type of movie: the one where you know the ending right off the bat, the one that makes love seem so easy, etc. But after my friends kept raving about it, I decided that I had to see THE NOTEBOOK, so I rented it the day it came out on video/DVD. The only regret I have is not seeing it sooner - it's that good. <br /> <br />Nowadays, the only movies that you ever really see are your oversexed teen comedies, horror movies, or romantic comedies that all blend together. THE NOTEBOOK is incredibly refreshing, with a touching story, amazing characters and plots, and, more importantly, a memorable story. I was amazed by every performance in THE NOTEBOOK (usually, I find at least one actor in a movie that I would replace), and all the characters are incredibly likeable (especially Noah...both young and old).  <br /> <br />It had annoyed me that they had waited so long to release THE NOTEBOOK on video/DVD, but not only was it worth the wait, but it fits the season perfectly (releasing this six days before Valentine's Day was a great idea). I can't justify this movie with my review...just go see THE NOTEBOOK. It isn't your typical chick flick, seeing as I know a few guys who enjoyed it as well. (Though, you do want to have a box of Kleenex on hand!) <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A+
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I suggest giving this album a couple of playings and let it sink in.  Unlike much of Metheny's previous work, this album really doesn't have tracks - well it DOES, but they're more or less seamless - it's a 68-minute plus \\"work.\\"  You won't be able to pick favorite songs on this CD. All you can do is go with it.<br /><br />This is classic Metheny with some new twists.  The addition of Gregoire Maret on harmonica for example.  When I first heard of this, it seemed strange.  Harmonica?  It actually works.<br /><br />Metheny fans should be pleased with this CD.  For those new to Metheny or the Pat Metheny Group, I suggest earlier albums first. Like \\"Still Life (Talking)\\" or \\"Letter from Home.\\"  Then work up to \\"The Way Up.\\"

B00004ZAV3|5.0|I just wanted everyone to know that this album was great! Before I bought this album, I only knew their Yellow Submarine songs from the movie.  But now I know alot more, thanks to this CD.  This CD inspired me to read every book about the Beatles that I can get my hands on! There is not one song that I dislike on the album.  This CD is especially good for new people who are wanting to know more about the Beatles. Now, my 6 year old cousin is always begging me to play the Beatles CD. The Beatles will live on forever, I see people all over my school wearing Beatles T-shirts! YAY!
B000084T18|2.0|the good news is that 50 cent is one of the worst rappers of all time but this is a decent album..... the even better news is that with his new crap out now (i.e. 'disco inferno' and 'candy shop') will make it big but will not make the splash he did 2 years ago....    terrible rapper.... after he talked about getting shot and messing people up, he has to go to talkin about somebody lickin the lollipop and it does not make sense.... what your hardcore then you want to \\"do it\\" make up ur mind!!!!    he has nothing else to talk about.....he is going the same route his 'opponent' is going (ja rule)....    the production is great on this album dr. dre is brilliant... that is why i bought the LP in the first place...but other than that this cd would not have been nothing with out 50's boyfriend, ohh i mean  \\"partner in crime\\" eminem...    sorry folks i may have not made fans from this review but im speaking from the heart that rap music is at its end thanks to rappers like him...50 may be history with GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN but he is going to end up just like the name of his new cd THE MASSACRE....

1401300901|5.0|Hard to believe the neg reviews.  This book is awesome! I am not even done yet, but I've gotten on the web to find the author's website to see what else she's done.  I think you can really feel all the emotions and experiences of the characters.  It's sad, hilarious, romantic, and hopeful all in one. It has had me laughing out, and crying quietly. I have already recommended it to my friends and family.  Darn good book!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Rarely does an album show up that is a true gem.  They usually have 5 good tracks follwed by an endless stream of repetition.  Another factor is that the record companies have their cookie-cutter machine that stamps out the same nu-metal, boy group or opther band that is here today and all over TRL, and gone the next day and treated like they never existed.  (Think George Orwell's 1984.)  Amidst the lothargic and depressing state of music, Interpol has come to change the scene.  They bring a hurricane of post-punk, garage rock, and their own sound to the table.  Not only are they musically talented, but the singer/ guitarist has a truly haunting resemblance to Ian Curtis of Joy Division.  The record while dark sounding, is beautiful.  The guitar work along with keyboards and an organ help fill in the gaps to give the listener a lush wall of sound.  The choice of instruments helps too.  That bright Beatles esque sound comes from the Epiphone Casino, while the lead comes from a Gibson Les Paul, and the unmistakable sonics of the Fender Jazz Bass fill in and add to the groove of the album.  The album has that timeless quality to it.  It sounds brand new any time you play it, whether that's today or ten years from now.  Completely Flawless!
B00076ZZ9I|4.0|I can't beleive I'm giving something pertaining to Back in Black less than 5 stars but I'm sad to say I have to.  I should say up front that I think Back in Black is the greatest album ever released and it's performed by the greatest band to ever walk (rock) the earth.  I already owned this album (still have my vinyl copy) so I bought this purely for the DVD component and there's just not enough there.  What's there is good but I was expecting (hoping, praying) for more.  The band interviews are good. Brian Johnson comes off the best in those.  His stories are very funny and he just seems like the kind of guy you want to throw back a few pints with.   <br /> <br />As far as the in studio \\"performances\\", they're OK.  It's basically Angus and Malcolm strumming their guitars along to the opening chords of selected songs and telling a little bit about the background of the song.  I guess that with the status of this album and the amount of video footage that has to be out there on this album I wanted more.  Unless you're a serious fan, don't bother with this, just pick up the regular album.
B00000294R|5.0|A lot of reviews have said the beats weren't great. This album was made in 96' so all the \\"new\\" hip-hop fans might not like it. But the old-school cats out there will find nothing wrong with it. Beats in this era usually ride over the MC so his voice is not the center of attention (ex: Dirt Off Yo Shoulder, and many other singles out today, no disrespect intended to Jay-Z). <br /> <br />The beats have a 90's rhythm. The lyrics and punchlines are incredible. \\"All Black\\" defines what a gangsta in the streets really is. With sick punchlines of brutal reality and somehow involving humor give Big L a unique position in hip-hop(So don't step to this cause I got a live crew/ you might be kinda big but they make coffins yo size too/) <br /> <br />A classic album contains no track skipping songs. Every song has a message and a certain style. For example, \\"Fed Up With Dat Bullsh*t\\" reveals another side of Big L which contains his struggle and resentment towards rascism(I'm not only fed up with the cops/ I'm also fed with the punk a$$ cabdrivers who don't stop/ they don't care if it's snowin/ first they slow down, then they see the skin is brown, and they keep goin'/) <br /> <br />Big L holds a unique style and a unique voice that give this album 5 stars. It is a classic and if anyone is considering rap as a career, this album would be one of the albums you would need to listen to.
B0002X314C|5.0|The Legend has arrived. Though I am a huge Roc-A-Fella Fan, and knew about Kanye West before anyone else did in 2001, I also knew about John Legend doing great things like \\"lucifer\\" with Jay and such. And though I love Kanye, John Legend is better, and could help Kanye West make a better Album, and not the other way around.  <br /> <br />This album was originally suppose to come out in November, went to pick it up when I saw it in the paper that Sunday, and it wasn't there. Well, I'm sorry, but I had to do something.  <br /> <br />So having this album since Thanksgiving, I have been able to appreciate for months now, and its the best thing that has happened to my ears. Its so honest, its real, it speaks to me the way Brian Mcknight used to do (see new Brian Mcknight Gemini Review). I am not a religous person, but I am spiritual, and this album raised my spirit to believe in the heavens even more. Thats what GOOD music does to me.  <br /> <br />From the fun of \\"number one\\", to what I'm going through with my woman on \\"Ordinary People\\", to reaching spiritual bliss on \\"Refuge\\", I couldn't thank John Stevens enough for wanting me to live and do my own music agian. <br /> <br />The Album is so good that I went and bought it even after having it for 2 months. Thats an album.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Part I (5 stars): Funny, I'm just not a big \\"karate buff\\", in fact, this probably is the only set of movies like this I own, or may ever own. When I tell people this is one of my favorite movies *ever*, they laugh. Then they say, \\"Are you serious?\\" And my words to explain why always fall short. Beyond the karate, beyond the underdog nature, there lie two characters that seem to compliment each other so perfectly it really makes the movie what it is regardless of the subject matter. Something about the chemistry between Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio simply defies convention and thrives on it. The casting by all involved was surely just one part luck, one part fortune, the DVD extras merely icing. My only complaint is this not being mastered to 5.1 DD sound.    *edit* I watched the commentary last night and I must say I was disappointed. Pat Morita's input was intrusive, and many comments made by the group were simply uncalled for. When Elizabeth Shue would walk away from the camera they would comment about her rear end and totally ruined a part of my respect for them. They went on to ridicule an \\"extra\\" who became a greeter of some sort. They laughed and carried on through the whole thing. At the beginning I thought, well they are a lively group, but after 45 minutes it wore thin and I wished then I would have turned it off. There were a few bits here and there I learned, but what I really learned is why companies have the disclaimer at the beginning of the movies.    Part II (4 stars): I'm kind of ashamed of avoiding this movie now. As much as I loved the first I never bothered with the second. I've just never been fond of sequels. Be it Back to the Future Two, the Lost World, or the hundred other sub par sequels, they just seem to mar the original product. However, here at Amazon I read that this story picks up 5 minutes after the first and that peaked my interest. Previously, I just assumed it would be directionless swill. So wrong. The score, the heart, the soul,and even the casting practically live up to the first, and I'm shocked at that. In fact Daniels love interest in this even out does the first!! Having the impact on me this film had 19 years after it was made is quite remarkable. It's not without it's flaws though, the last 15-20 minutes really just seemed to lose steam, the \\"storm\\" sequence being almost painful. Sad that there are no extra's to speak of, this movie may have been even more interesting to hear about.    Part III (3 stars): Definitely the weakest of the three, still a must see for the simple fact that Pat and Ralph still have that spark. Sadly, the casting choices for the villains are overwrought and the story just seems forced. I suppose the concept was losing its impact but regardless, the script just wasn't well thought out. Again, this picks up right after Part II and there is just something about this continuity that makes me think John Avildsen has courage and vision. The weakest part of the script easily being the \\"sign the paper\\" portions that defied common sense, still like Part II I'm simply shocked these movies are not disastrous \\"1 out of 5's\\" (as some here at Amazon alluded to) although having the original director onboard surely meant these movies had the stability they needed... and deserved. Having viewed Parts II and III has forever altered the way I will view Part I, and I'm relieved to report it's all for the better. They only enhanced what I knew and make me appreciate it that much more. Why not have commentary on all three movies?    ---    The Next Karate Kid (2 stars): I'm trying to view this as a sort of \\"bonus movie\\" within the packaged set. While 2 stars may seem low I think this movie does contain some decent performances by Hillary and Pat. The problem again is the script, hell, even the premise. So, a middle aged woman lets a friend of her fathers move in with her teenage daughter while she goes and stays at his home California? Please. A big problem are the overzealous sadistic \\"TV Movie\\" quality of just about everyone except the two leads. Even the love interest in this is so utterly flat it is totally deflated. Most of what should have had an impact (like the Hawk) didn't and a certain parts (like \\"Zen\\" bowling) seemed like embarrassing filler.
B000002UVX|5.0|Everything after the first three songs on this album is some of the best throwaway music you will ever hear, and better than 75% of just about anything else ever done most likely, but it's those first three songs, yes, those first three songs, especially the first two, that easily make this one of the greatest albums Of All Time.  I include Changes purely as a tribute to Buddy Miles, and it was one of his only songs that made the charts.  The first two songs baby.  Turn this one up as loud as you possibly can, puff some herb, and you will hear God.  Especially if you focus on the fact it was recorded live on New Years Eve 1969 at the Fillmore East and everything that was going on at that time in the world  (For those who are historically ignorant, it was the height of the Vietnam War for example, and you would routinely hear on the nightly news that two or three hundred guys had been killed in that days fighting.  Is that intense enough for you!)   <br /> <br />I knew a guy who went to this concert.  He said LSD was being passed around like freaking candy and it was some of the best he ever had.  The entire crowd was whacked so bad it took them about 5 seconds to finally start clapping at the end of Machine Gun.   <br /> <br />I heard a story about this album that I'm not sure is true or not, but someone told me once that Bill Graham got pissed at Hendrix for screwing around the first half of the evening they recorded this and not taking the music seriously enough.  It was a very important project to Graham.  When Hendrix came off the stage after the first half of the evening Graham pulled him aside and angrily told him he was playing like crap.  Upon his return to the stage Hendrix proceeded to lay down the most stunning stuff Graham had ever heard or would ever hear, and when he was done and came back off the stage he gave Graham a nasty look while walking by and said something like \\"Satisfied?\\". <br /> <br />This is another fantastic album to listen to on a longdrive.  I can never get enough of this one.  Anyone that doesn't give this priceless gift from God to Humankind a 5 star rating is flat out buck dumb, like the turd who only gave him a 3 star rating on this site and starts off by saying \\"From a guitarists point of view....\\".  What a turd!  That turd could only dream of playing even one chord like Hendrix.   <br /> <br />This album is only 3 guys! Bass, drums, guitar.  Nothing else.  No special mixing equipment, no backing musicians, nothing.  They lay down some of the most scorching material ever heard by human ears, and Hendrix pulls sounds out of his guitar that will make your spine tingle so much you'll involuntarily soil yourself.  Don't even dare not give this 5 stars.  This stuff is beyond hardcore, trust me.   <br /> <br />Over and out. <br />(The Professor recommends: \\"Black Napkins\\" from Zappa's Zoot Allures album).
B0006IIKS0|3.0|After watching a movie you really start to hate Lars. This movie is all about him. He shares his spotlight in the movie with James Hetfield, but overshadows James all the time. <br /> <br />If you'll be watching this movie, pay close attention to Kirk. He looks like he doesn't have any say in the band at all. But it looks like it doesn't really bother Kirk a whole lot. He just wants to play music, make money and enjoy himself. Now I really understand why Jason Newsted left Metallica. The movie does have some good parts in it with Jason, but they all get overshadowed again by Lars.  <br /> <br />You can tell that Lars always acts in front of camera. The rest of the guys do a good job of being natural on camera. Lars is doing a performance of a lifetime. You can really tell that he has a Napoleon Complex. Being short, that man is so insecure with himself that he constantly has to prove something to somebody and that leads to being not natural on camera.  <br />(By the way, I am not pounding Lars because of Napster. I totally support Metallica's actions against Napster) <br /> <br />James Hetfield on the other hand is shown as a very composed guy. It's definitely a new side of James that viewers learn from the film. I got nothing but positive vibe from James throughout the entire film. <br /> <br />But anyway, watch the movie. You'll enjoy it. I really don't understand why this documentary was chosen as a Sundance Selection. Being a huge fan of Metallica, I didn't find this film to be extremely good. It has its great and funny moments, but overall I give it 3 STARS. I liked \\"Metallica: Year and a Half Part I & II\\" a lot more. <br />
B000003JDO|5.0|That's what one of the popular music mags wrote back in 1971, and they were quite right. \\"Aqualung\\" was the first Tull album to present lyrics with Anderson's personal thoughts on serious sides of life. Often mistaken for a concept album, \\"Aqualung\\" isn't one, but a collection of strong songs, that each speaks its own. I'll write about it later, and want to speak about musicianship first. Clearly, Tull members are showing impressive growth. Particularly, it's Martin Barre's now established guitar playing, and Ian Anderson's confidence with acoustic arrangements and more freedom with his flute. 2 guitars and an omnipresent flute is what constitutes the sound of this record. Anderson also grew as a singer, and his passionate performance is definitely the band's highlight. <br /> <br />The songs here fall into one of the 2 categories, either carefully composed mellow acoustic tracks with an obvious folksy influence, or strong rocking compositions with lots of electric guitars, with neither pattern dominating, and both sounding strong and impressive throughout. Overall the album's sound is somewhat cold. <br /> <br />The title track starts out with a heavy guitar riff, and alternates heavy and soft styles for its duration. On the contrary, \\"Cross Eyed Mary\\" is not so hard hitting, though with electric guitars, and gives flute much playing time. Both songs depict members of the lower class, a bum and a teenage prostitute, with brilliant lyrics expressing cold observation, slight sympathy, and a little of surprising irony, all at once. <br />\\"Cheap Day Return\\" is a beautiful short acoustic number, telling about Ian's thought on his way back from visiting his dad at the hospital. In one of the interviews Ian said that this song originally covered the entire trip from London to the hospital and back, but it ended up being so long, that, on second thought, Anderson cut it to just 1:23 length. I guess that's a typical display of Ian's sence of humour. <br />\\"Mother Goose\\" isa strange song with nonsense lyrics. It bears lots of English folk influence, and is one of the stronger numbers here. <br />\\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" is one of Anderson's most personal and beautiful love songs. As he himself said, it's difficult to write a love song without falling into some kind of a cliche. Well, he managed to make an absolutely original one, and an excellent one, too! There's some orchestration here, perhaps, a taste of things to come for the \\"War Child\\" album. <br />\\"Up To Me\\", another half-nonsense ironic song, tells about a typical day of a low-class member, probably a low paid worker. Absolutely chilling flute here! This one is an acoustic track, but it shows some edge towards the end. Definite highlight! <br />\\"My God\\" opens up the second half of the album, subtitled the same. It was originally meant to be the title of the album, but the idea was scrapped after a similarly titled bootleg record appeared not long before \\"Aqualang\\" release date. This is one of Tull's most famous songs. It's message is aimed against organized religion, and how it twists the concept of God to justify puruing of its own interests. With a very complex instrumentation, this song is definitely the album's culminating point, and one of rock music classic numbers. <br />\\"Hymn 43\\" develops the same message, this time with a hard accompanement with a dominating electric guitar and a piano. \\"Jesus saves, but he better save himself // From gory glory seekers who use his name in death\\", the part of the lyrics that perfectly sums it all up. <br />\\"Slipstream\\" is yet one more short acoustic song telling about aimlessness of the man's way of life. <br />\\"Locomotive Breath\\" is perhaps the best known song from this album, being a hit-single. It has the most listener-friendly music (especially the rhythm pattern), but it's not a pop tune. It's a very strong composition with an instantly recognized piano part. <br />\\"Wind Up\\" literally winds up this album on a strong note. It's anothermessage sending anthem about how younger people shouldn't blindly accept the religious beliefs of their parents, but instead must investigate the concept of God on their own, and accept the only personal belief that they feel is right. \\"I don't believe you, you have the whole damn thing all wrong! He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays\\" sings Ian in closing parts of this brilliant album that I'll safely put among the Top-10 records of 70's rock music. Nothing could be added to this statement of personal rebellion. Buy the album and hear it yourself. <br /> <br />This jubileum edition has some bonus tracks. \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" is a working version of a song that found its way into \\"War Child\\". \\"Wind Up\\" is some fancy remastered version of the same song off this album, which I don't find particularly good. The closing three tracks are most probably a recording of the band playing for some radio-show, for Alexis Corner, maybe? And there's also a lengthy interview by Ian Anderson about this album and that whole era in music. A nice one, but it would be better to make it a final track, for obvious reasons. The bonus-tracks a re a nice addition to the overall value, but the value of the original album is a thousand times bigger, so one should buy \\"Aqualung\\" not for the bonuses, but for exceptionally good quality of music.
B000001F3C|5.0|An amazing record and a masterpiece production from Steve Lillywhite.  The energy and emotional urgency resembles bands such as Chameleons UK and Wired Remorse.  The vocals are always straight from the heart and the echoing feedback guitars, courtesy of the Edge, are often intense while still remaining atmospheric.  \\"Like A Song\\" is the true gem here but there are so many other moments.  This is one of my top albums of all-time!  If you don't already have it, get it!
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is by far my favorite album that Metallica has put out.  It was right before they released their Black Album, which most consider their \\"turning point\\" in their career.  All the songs on this album are great.  You will find their first single that made a video for, \\"One.\\"  I love this song.  It has so much emotion and anger in it.  I also think that the video was great, even though most feel that they sold out by making it.  The video portrayed the song quite well, with scenes of war and hospitals.  On this album is my favorite song Metallica has ever made and that is the song \\"...And Justice For All.\\"  It's slow and fast and has great lyrics all in one song.  I would definitely tell anyone to purchase this album.
B0006399FS|5.0|At first, when i saw the video of Vertigo on TV, i thought that the tune and the beat is catchy. But my impression on the whole song didn't exactly had the very same impact. At that time, i was just happy that U2 is ON with a new album again. <br /> <br />When I was able to listen to the whole album on the NME website, the impression was, \\"Hey, did they even spend time writing these songs?!\\"  <br /> <br />Then my cousin sent me the special edition of the album, the one with the bonus track \\"Fast Cars\\" and that's when i learned how to unlock the mystery. <br /> <br />Just like every U2 album, the latest release How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (HTDAAB) need more listening for the songs to sink in. I couldn't remember one U2 album wherein after one sitting then all the songs tend to be catchy and after a week's listening it gets covered with dust. NO.  <br /> <br />although this new material may be described as \\"too wordy\\" and doesn't have the same subliminal effects that the albums \\"The Joshua Tree\\", \\"Acthung Baby\\" or even \\"Pop\\" had. The lyrics in this album are more, shall we say, radio friendly and not as mind-boggling as it was in the other albums. But, you see, that is where the trick lies, on being simple, yet ful of meaning. <br /> <br />The songs in the album runs on a more personal level than any of the U2 albums. The songs \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"A Man and A Woman\\" takes a blue-blooded U2 listener to take to heart these songs. The band has grown more mature. The lyrics are on a personal basis, but the message is still on a general note and listeners can actually relate the songs to their own lives. Yes, the lyrics may be a little lighter but this doesn't mean that the meaning of the entire song is. <br /> <br />They are sending a different message this time. Not more about a revolution. Enough of the anger. It can be read somewhere that Bono has had enough of taking political sides but is more keen on taking a stance.And the stance is to unite and fight the war on poverty and debt on third world countries. And on a certain standpoint, the whole band has followed where Bono has taken lead. And the path that the band has taken is evident in the songs they've produced: \\"Love, Peace Or Else\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Crumbs On Your Table\\". <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"All Because of You\\" are the old-time rockers delight. These songs can make you stomp your feet and \\"swing to the music\\". <br /> <br />A song to note is \\"Yahweh\\". A song of surrender. Not the typical U2 album-ender. Lines such as \\"Take this mouth, so quick to criticise...Take this mouth, give it a kiss\\" is so proverbial yet with a timely tune to it. <br /> <br />All the songs are written with taste, warmth and the usual depth that U2 injects in most of their songs. This time, add the term \\"personal note\\" when describing the songs. <br /> <br />The album will take you closer to what U2 is all about. This is U2 gracefully coming of age.
B000002L5I|3.0|For young people coming from a rock/metal background it can be pretty hard to put on the breaks and start to dig the Blues. The closest a metal head may come to authentic blues is Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. For rock/punk fans they can start with The Black Keys and their Punk Blues revival but for metal heads it can be a hard transition.  Kenny Wayne Shepherd gives them a transitory experience which they can then use to delve into the 60's R&B scene (The Yardbirds, John Mayall & The Bluesbrekaers/Eric Clapton, Savoy Brown, etc). And from there they can descend into the delights of Albert King, Albert Collins, Roy Buchanan, Otis Rush, Robert Johnson, B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, etc.  <br /> <br />Kenny sounds like a kid who has just discovered that people dig his guitar playing. His enthusiasm shines through the music. This is a cat who just loves to play. He loves to rock, he loves to boogie. And he also likes fireworks. His solo's are often relatively simple but come off sounding bigger and more impressive than are through the mastery of his bending, raking and shuffling. <br /> <br />I recommended any intermediate guitarist picking up some of his tab. Give some of his solo's a burl, they shouldnt be too hard to grasp and will provide you with some ideas of how effective the minor pentatonic can be. (Make sure once you have got him down pat you move on to Stevie Ray Vaughan for a real challenge). For anybody else who like to get into the blues but dont know where to start, Give this a go.
B000024QML|5.0|If ever there was an album which rendered every one of its songs a potential hit single, 'Very' takes the cake. Blending both smart-alec and sentimental lyrics with the catchiest pop hooks, the Pet Shop Boys have truly packed a veritable punch against the pop establishment. Almost immediately, anybody who hears this album for the first time, is taken aback by the intensely mood-driven and extraordinary lyrics and subject matter set to simple, albeit boy-bandish hooks and rhythms. Before this album, the Boys had consistently obscured themselves behind a veil of listless apathy and cold, icy indifference. But with 'Very,' Neil and Chris (wisely) decided to expose their vulnerability and inner-most emotions. In fact, 'Very would prove to be a watershed moment for them, leading to more intimate and mature records. The major highlights of this album include the subtle, yet in-your-face mischief of \\"Can You Forgive Her\\", a sneaky and taunting tale of a faux-straight closet queen; \\"Liberation,\\" an idealistic love song set to one of the Boys' sweetest and most melodic soundtracks; the foreboding \\"Dreaming of the Queen,\\" which is a haunting and eerie testament to AIDS; \\"To Speak is a Sin,\\" a rather dark and cryptic \\"back-alley\\" portrayal of the gay underworld; the brazen and audacious \\"screw showbusiness\\" approach to \\"Yesterday, When I was Mad; and the beat-driven anecdote of juvinility in \\"Young Offender.\\" Yet the ultimate showstopper to this record is the song for which this album is most remembered: \\"Go West.\\" Upon first listen, one would think this to be a simple, perhaps perfunctory call for Utopia, first appealed for by the Village People. But upon realization, one discovers that the Pet Shop Boys have turned it on its head into a haunting and bizarrely moving requiem to those who have been taken by AIDS. What makes this song so eerie and yet poignant, is Tennant's weak, thin voice set up against pop grandeur. In fact, Tennant's voice conjures up that of a weak and wounded \\"soldier,\\" trying to bring hope to compatriots lying dead all around him in a field, yet knowing all along that he and his countrymen have lost the War against AIDS. <br />All in all, this album showcases the best of what the Boys have accomplished in their career. Even though the Boys have been vastly underappreciated here in the States, they have proven themselves over and over again to the world as both innovators to be wreckoned with, and incredibly talented songwriters. <br />
B000021YQV|4.0|System of a Down's follow up to their first album was much better than I thought it would be. Their first album was definitely better but this one was far from disappointing. All of their songs are fast paced and loud, but done well, unlike so many metal artists around today. This is a must buy for any fan of metal sounding music. <br /> <br />Brad
B000002MFN|5.0|Doesn't it always seem to be that an artist's most accomplished and thought-provoking piece of work, also ends up being their most under-appreciated and forgotten? Such is highly the case with Erotica. Released on the heels of the Sex book controversy, in which the world practically burned Madonna at the stake for heresy, Erotica was dismissed by most critics and the public as merely \\"Sex: on-tape\\". But for anybody who gives the album a chance, they will discover that this is nothing of the sort (for the record, only two or three songs out of the fourteen actually address sex). Erotica can be more accurately described as a look into the politics of relationships and all of the emotions that are brought into play. Some even accused the record of being frigid, cold, emotionless and aloof. But they failed to realize that this is where Madonna's brilliance was achieved. Take the album's artwork for example: there was a \\"rhyme and reason\\" to the fact that the cover was frosty white and blue, or that the inside of the booklet simulated a COLD stainless steel look and feel to it. Madonna wanted to portray the unpleasant, cold, hard reality of sex and love. She had plenty of time to soften these themes up as she did in Bedtime Stories. But with Erotica, Madonna's intention was to show love as it really is, not its ideal. Don't let the controversy and assumptions surrounding this record dissuade you from giving it a try. I promise that you will find this album way ahead of its time and well worth the money. In my opinion this may be Madonna's most accomplished record to date (probably on par with Ray of Light), in terms of its thematic cohesiveness, style and artistry. People (even her \\"fans\\") still tend to disregard this album even now that the Sex book is out of the way, because they make the mistake of judging it by its thematic elements; but if you look it at from an artistic view, you will undoubtedly see how brilliant this record is. I just wish that Madonna wouldn't ignore and dismiss this album as she appears to have done throughout the past eight or so years.
B00005JNEW|4.0|\\"Friday Night LIghts\\" is one of the best sports stories I have ever seen or read.  The fact that this is an actual true story makes this movie even more powerful. <br /> <br />The movie starts with a 7-10 minute collage of scenes.  It is very fast-paced and quickly gets you in gear for the story-line.  We are in Odessa, TX and high school football is king.  The season is about to start and expectations are extremly high, since \\"Boobie\\" Miles is the running back that is supposed to take the team to the state championship.   <br /> <br />As the beginning goes on, we are introduced to all of our players and see what an average day of practice is like for them.  They are hounded by the media, fans in the stands and then finally, by their parents and the rest of the town after practice.  Again, high school football is king in this town. <br /> <br />Our main characters make up an interesting group. <br />-Winchell, QB..he is the nervous leader, never taking a moment to relax.  Perhaps that is because his mother is mentlly ill and will not stop grlling him on the game. <br />-Billingsley, RB..My favorite player. He lives in the shadow of his father's glory.  His father is also a drunk who prods and beats Billingsley because he is not as good as his father. <br />-Christian, DE..Tough, mean and quiet.  Christian says about 7 lines throughout the movie, but the emotion shown in their last game is amazing.  He is also arguably their best player. <br />-Chavez, CB..Hard-hitting and extremly smart.  He is actually mentioned as being the smartest kid in school.  He is also awesome on defense and has a lighter attitude when it comes to football. <br />-\\"Boobie\\" Miles, RB..Great running back, but very cocky.  \\"Boobie\\" is the story, but for reasons that I will not go into as to save you from a spoiler. <br />-Mcmillan, RB...third-string RB. Another one of my favorites.  I love his childish attitude and professional determination.  He is also good for a few laughs along the way. <br />-Coach...This is Billy Bob Thorton's character.  I thought this movie would revolve around him, but for once, a football movie does NOT depend on the coach for it's plot.   <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is really amazing and should not be missed by any fan of football or sports movies.  Forget about \\"The Replacements\\" or \\"Remember the Titans\\"(although that was excellent as well) or \\"Varsity Blues\\"...This movie is the real deal!!
B000001IQH|5.0|First, I want it known I am not a fan of the Epitaph roster. I find it to be full of poseur bands and I hate NOFX, but I'll give props when it is due. Rancid are a great punk pop band the way the Descendents are. Tim Armstrong writes perfect songs that owe as much to the Clash as the Subhumans. And his ska songs are some of the best in the genre. But make no mistake, Rancid definitely have a sound of their own, and they prove it on this album.
0312305060|3.0|Cunningham is pretty bold to write a book about women even though he isn't one, so I had to check it out. But frankly, the hours is pretty much a second version of his all-time favorite writer, Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. the hours is pretty much Mrs. Dalloway two. His writing is beautiful but it's all pretty much a shadow of Mrs. Dalloway, I read Mrs. Dalloway first before I read the Hours and I saw tons of similarity, alot of of it seem to be taken out directly out of Mrs. Dalloway. For example the whole gay people thing, that's because Mrs. Dalloway's heroin has that element of gayness, so Cunningham just had to put it in there. But unlike Virginia Woolf, who wrote Mrs. Dalloway clearly to represent herself, Cunningham wrote the hours which makes him seem like a woman expert, but really, does he really know what is going on in our minds just because he did extend research on Virgina Woolf and her book?? Another thing, the theme of the hours apparenly is the reflect life with death, each of the hero/heroine killed him/herself so that the people around him/her would value life more and go live their lives instead of caring for him/her. But couldn't it go the other way around too? Cunningham really failed to make each suicide seem heroic. each of the woman all seemed to be the same person, and have pretty much the same problems, they are somewhat gay, mental issues, live for the people around them etc, if Cunningham make each woman entirely different yet still connects them, I would then say: \\" hats off to you\\". And also, I do have to agree that does Cunningham have to write about the minds of women who have issues??? Why couldn't he write about normal woman, that would've been more original, although I highly doubt he can. Can a man really know what a woman thinks? this pretty much proves that Cunningham lacks originality and wholly wrote the hours to honor Virginia Woolf.
B000002KIE|5.0|Ever since I got this album, it's been my second favorite punk album next to Nirvana's Bleach (Yes, they WERE a punk band). Johnny Rotten's vocals are so sarcastic and just plain mean, it's hard for me not to love it. This really is an album that, when you pick up an instrument for the first time, you can play along. I guess I can see how others might not like it, but it really just seems brilliant to me. This really is the album that seperates \\"punks\\" from the \\"punk rockers\\".
B00070Q7VO|5.0|THANK YOU WARNERS FOR ALLOWING THIS ARTIST TO BE HIMSELF. I'VE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SEE MICHAEL IN CONCERT AND WITNESS FIRSTHAND HIS VOCAL MAGIC AND HIS ONSTAGE CHARISMA - HE IS AN ENTERTAINER OF THE HIGHEST CALIBRE.

B000002OTL|5.0|Between Samuel L. Jackson quoting scripture and then unloading an entire clip into a guy and the humorous antidotes of dialogue between John Travolta and Jackson, the soundtrack from the movie Pulp Fiction has to be one of the best movie soundtracks since the Doors. If you like the soundtrack from another one of Quentin Tarantino's movies, Reservoir Dogs, you will truly love this soundtrack.  The soundtrack is diverse.  It varies from Al Green's mellow and relaxing vocals \\"Let's Stay Together\\" to the harsh deep bass of Kool and the Gang's \\"Jungle Boogie.\\"  Even if the movie was not to your aesthetic liking, this unique combination of songs will completely grab your attention.  However, if you did enjoy the movie then the songs and soundbites from the film will put you right back in the movie.  You will remember the dirty feeling you got when Travolta was shooting heroin when hearing \\"Bullwinkle Part II\\" by The Centurians , and Uma Thurman's intense stare to the sweet sound of the saxophone in \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\" by Dusty Springfield.  <br />            This album is perfect for just laying around in your room or in the car on your way home from school or work. If you have a diverse, out of the ordinary appeal for music this album is perfect for you.  The genre of the album is constantly changing. Musically this album will appeal to all generations with the classics, \\"You Can Never Tell\\" by Chuck Berry and \\"Lonesome Town\\" by Ricky Nelson, even the oldie by the Statler Brothers, \\"Flowers on the Wall\\" is here.  Every song on this album has a unique rhythm that will keep your attention throughout the course of the album.  There are a couple of instrumentals throughout the album that may sound a bit repetitive after awhile but it does not hurt the appeal of the album because it offers a chance to appreciate some of the best guitar and sax on the album.  Add record producer to Tarantino's list of accomplishments.  He is proving to be a man of many talents.<br />            If you have a wide range of music appreciation and can stomach some of the disturbing verbal out takes from a violent movie then this is the next best thing to buying a copy of the movie.  <br />
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|At first I didn't want to see this movie because I thought it would be boring, and stupid, not to mention it had Brad Pitt. But then my best friend, who has never guided me wrong on movies, told me how great it was, and said I should cheack it out. I was a little hesitent at first because again I wasn't sure if I should waist my dollars on it or not. I took a chance and saw it.<br />  IT WAS AMASING!<br />  I couldn't believe I was going to miss out on this amazingly made movie. It's got something for everything. Semi-nude Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, along with Orlando Bloom. Not to mention a few love storys for us sencitive people, and some major butt kicking for us action people. The battel scenes though long, where amazing and well done. The fight between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana), was amazing. The first time I saw it, I was at the eage of my seat, at a loss for breath. Completely taken in by every move they made. Though me being the Greek Geek that I am knew who was going to die, but I was still amazed. <br />  The only problem I found was I was too attached to the characters, which is a good thing, and when they died I wanted to cry. (I think I did when Hector and Achilles died), but I my heart went out to Hector?s wife, and Achille?s lover. That normally doesn?t happen to me.<br />  All I?m saying is it?s got something for everyone, some love, and some blood.
0553801546|5.0|The Tawny Man series was phenomenal.  Hobb built on the simpler foundation laid in the original trilogy, and made the story and the characters so much more complex and enriched.  Fitz's continual rediscovery and reinvention of himself is a great read, and many other characters are revealed in a new light as all the bits of story begin to be explained and resolved in this final book. <br /> <br />I recommend this series greatly, as well as the original Farseer Trilogy which should definitely be read first.
B0006IIPJ4|3.0|For Saturday matinee movie pleasure this film would be hard to beat.  Think \\"Buck Rogers\\" meets \\"Indiana Jones\\" with a healthy dollop of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" thrown in.  A plot by an evil genius has unleashed robots of every description, including ones that flap their metal wings like birds, upon the world's resources.  Sky Captain Joseph Sullivan (played by Jude Law) tries to stop the invasions to no avail, with troublesome Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) tagging along.  Surmounting various trials and tribulations along the way the duo manages to reach the locus of this menace to the earth. <br /> <br />All the 1930s film types and colors are here: sepia tones and the almost cartoonish skyscrapers, but with 70 year old technology mated to fantastically advanced machines on both sides of the conflict.  \\"Wild Wild West\\" comes to mind here with its anachronistic blend of high-tech and antique inventions.  Other stereotypes are blended in too--surely the reporter's name \\"Polly Perkins\\" draws on Sweet Polly (the reporter) in the Underdog cartoon series. <br /> <br />You must suspend most of your logical faculties to best enjoy this show.  Consider the absurdity of an industrial center big and sophisticated enough to create these huge flying robots (not to mention the other machines) just to steal generators.  It'd be like sending an Abrams tank to grab a few tin cans.  Or the side by side high and low technologies of prop aircraft that can do so much more than just fly.  But it's all good fun to watch anyway. <br /> <br />One slightly jarring error in the movie is the reference to the Great War as WWI.  Of course it didn't take on that name until after WWII, which is yet to happen. <br /> <br />This isn't a great movie, but it is an entertaining one.  Sit back and let the thrills and chills wash over you.  You may not like the slightly hazy look of the film (which is deliberate) but you've got to admire the computer graphics anyway.  The rating is a rather clean PG, probably because of one strong scene in which someone gets thoroughly electrocuted.  The show was not a big hit so don't wait for a sequel to enjoy a little Saturday afternoon magic.
B0006IJ5PM|4.0|For those who haven't read the book, then this is your typical, predictable feel good movie with good acting, and good action.  However, don't get it twisted cuz this isn't hardly the best football movie ever made.  I'd take Rudy, The Longest Yard, Remember the Titans and even Any Given Sunday which had much better acting than this one.  But it's good enough where you can add it to the collection.   <br /> <br />Next time a director wants to actually direct a movie based on actual facts at least get the game correct.  Carter and Permian didn't play in the championship game that year, in the book it was the semi-finals in which Carter did go on to win State.  They also left out the major fact surrounding the game that Carter had to go to court on several different occassions during the playoffs to let one of their academically ineligible stars play during the playoffs because of an Algebra class he had failed by 1 point.  That major fact was left out because of what?  It strictly dealt with racism directed at Carter by not only Permian, but other surrounding area schools because Carter was pretty much unbeatable, and all black hight schoold, had the most talent, and the other schools needed a reason to find a chink in the armor.     <br /> <br />But overall the movie was okay.  But if you read the book, you;ll probably have a lot more questions as to why the director veered so far away from it, and made such drastic changes.
0140277447|4.0|Had this book merely called the attention of Western readers to this neglected and heartbreaking topic, it would have been a very important work.   <br /> <br />But this book is also very concise, superbly structured, and well-written (if, on rare occasions, a tad overwrought).   <br /> <br />It is not the last word on the subject, but it is a very good introduction to it.
1400043662|5.0|In my opinion, Murakami is one of the greatest writers of today! <br />His style is flawless.  He is very easy to read. I have to force myself to slow down while reading Him so I can enjoy his writing like a fine piece of chocolate.  In this novel he blends \\"reality\\" with dream.  There are also plenty of philosophical ideas for the intellect to chew on.  I also highly recommend \\"Wind-up Bird Chronicles\\".  <br /> <br />
0142000663|5.0|I can't say enough about this book or the author, John Steinbeck.  \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a heart-wrenching story about a family and its struggles and perseverence through the Depression.  It is so well written it makes you feel like you're there.<br /><br />Bottom line:  One of the best books I have ever read.  Put it at the top of your \\"To Read\\" list.
B00028HBKC|3.0|I was very disappointed with the DVD version of \\"Passion of the Christ\\".  I saw the movie when it was first released last year. The acting, the music, the use of Aramaic/Hebrew/Latin in the film with the English subtitles, were all superb. <br /> <br />Enter the DVD version.  The cinema and actors of course are great, but there is a narrator giving me a blow by blow (pun intended) running commentary of what I am watching on the screen, and another one reading the English subtiltles to me. The whole mood and atmosphere of the original movie is totally lost, and it seems to detract somewhat from the superb acting.  It's as though someone decided they were going to make a movie for the blind.  <br /> <br />Save your money on this DVD and buy The Book.  Then you can read the original accounts by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
B000641Z90|5.0|The Fist Farewell Tour DVD is easily the best DVD released by Phil Collins to date. Firstly the performance is first rate with Phil's voice sounding better than ever and with Chester Thomson back on drums the music too has lifted a notch. The quality of the sound is astounding and the director did a great job with the way in which this production was filmed, with no jumping between shots at a rapid rate as can be seen on some other concert dvd's. The amount of extra's are generous to say the least with almost every song performed in concert being accompanied by its video in the extra's. Most other artists would hold this material over for another dvd, so anyone who says this isn't value for money needs a reality check. All this ensures this is a dvd that will be enjoyed for years to come.
0062502182|4.0|Paulo Coelho's novel apparently has a strong international following.  After reading this, I can begin to understand the devotion attached to this book.  He writes a story about a young, shepherd boy's quest to fulfill his dream which feels like a story of the oral tradition.  He writes in a simple, metaphysical style of language that conveys a sense of mysticism from the get go.  He is walking a fine line here between mystic fable and story cliches, but for the most part I think that he succeeds.  The repetitive use of phrases such as \\"Personal Legend\\" occasionally irritated me, but I found the plot to be intriguing, the characters vivid and exciting and I enjoyed the story immensely.  This is a rare story that would be equally at home in the oral tradition as on the written page, and although Coelho doesn't succeed in this duality 100% of the time, he pulls it off consistantly enough for me to recommend this book.
0670033375|5.0|This is a logical sequel to Diamond's previous book. Both these books are basically works in applied human geography in that Diamond seeks to correlate environmental and ecological factors with subsequent cultural and economic development, specifically with the rise and ultimate fall of that particular culture or civilization. (Also Diamond's book is much more readable than other authors in the field that I've read. (Those of you who know what von Thunen circles are will know what I'm talking about :-)).<br /><br />Diamond's book places him squarely in the context of that debate, and with other great historians such as Toynbee, Spengler, Edward Gibbon, John Bury, and J.S. Mill, who have also pondered the question of the rise and fall of civilizations. Drawing on diverse sources of evidence and on his broad and far-reaching knowledge of many cultures around the world, Diamond makes a compelling case for the claim that those cultures that failed to come to terms with the inexorable limitations of their environment ultimately decline or perhaps even cause their own premature demise. As others have commented, however, Diamond's thesis is not that environmental factors are the exclusive cause of such success or failure, but rather that failure to manage these resources sensibly can have serious enough effects on overall quality of life and standards of living, so that over time they can impair and degrade a society's well being enough to sometimes kill it off entirely, as in Easter Island, or damage it possibly beyond repair. The heavily polluted shores and areas around the Aral Sea in the former Soviet Union also come to mind.<br /><br />I saw this sort of devastation myself back in the early 80s when I drove across much of the former Eastern bloc countries, and saw landscapes in western Czechoslovakia that had been strip-mined to the point where it looked like a nuclear war had been fought. I saw dozens of abandoned factories and places that looked like ghost towns on the road to Prague from Pilsen. I almost turned back, but pressed on, and was pleased to see that Prague was actually a very beautiful city as I'd been told, despite what I had to drive through to get there.<br /><br />Diamond, however, is cautiously optimistic about American society although he sees many baleful influences and trends there that are cause for concern, such as deforestation. (I note that several people here were critical of this idea; in Diamond's defense I would point out that 80% of the U.S. forested areas have been logged since 1800 and less than half that has been replanted).<br /><br />Most historians will tell you that however admirable they might be, all of these attempts to arrive at such historical laws have basically been failures. They fall into that unfortunate category of great theories that were killed off by nasty little facts. However, at least Diamond is in distinguished company. For those of you who already know thinkers like Oswald Spengler, John Stuart Mill, and Arnold Toynbee, the attempt to find those deterministic factors that drive the success or failure of entire civilizations will already be a familiar idea.<br /><br />To just briefly recap (at the risk of a little digression) the history of this idea, Spengler thought that civilizations were analogous to living organisms, thriving when young but withering in old age; Mill thought that cultures went through positive and negative periods in their belief systems and ideologies, rising and falling on that basis; and Toynbee had the idea of \\"challenge and response,\\" which is just like it sounds. A civilization is confronted with certain challenges and problems during its development. If it succeeds in surmounting them, it grows and becomes more powerful; if it fails, as almost all do at some point, it declines and ultimately dies off. Diamond's book places him squarely in the middle of a historical debate and problem which many of the greatest historical minds have pondered andstruggled with for much of their careers.<br /><br />Lastly, Oxford historian Filipe Fernandez-Armesto is another important modern historian who has also pondered this problem, and whose agriculturally and ecologically influenced ideas are actually not that different from Diamond's. On a different note, Harvard social psychologist David McClelland found that a country's increasing prosperity and power correlated with the increasing prominence of the individual personality traits of achievement motivation, ability to defer gratification, and a positive work ethic.<br /><br />My take on this from my own reading of history (although I'm not a professional historian, merely an interested and well-informed amateur) is that the conditions and circumstances of each civilization and what ultimately led to its rise and fall, seem special or unique to that particular historical context, and probably wouldn't have worked out the same at a different time and place. Therefore, I am sceptical that general laws about the rise and fall of civilizations can be found, although I think there is a good deal of truth in the ideas of all these men. In that sense, it could be said that Toynbee's failure was greater than most other writer's successes.<br /><br />Of course, all civilizations must maintain a strong military and economy, otherwise they are simply overrun by their enemies. Providing that, however, it seems to me that it comes down to the fact that there is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come. Great societies-- such as those of Old Kingdom Egypt, 2nd millenium B.C. Minoan civilization, Golden-Age Athens, early Renaissance Italy, or modern America, are built because people are galvanized by the ideas they embody and by the opportunities they create. The energy, dynamism, and enthusiasm this creates is what makes their rise to power possible and is what makes them great. When this is no longer the case, the formerly great society goes into decline. In that sense my own idea works out to sort of a combination of Mill's and McClelland's theories.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that his selection of cultures and civilizations that support his thesis, although diverse, includes many obscure ones that have left very little influence in the way of a legacy for succeeding civilizations, while ignoring those such as the Romans, Greeks, and so on, whose rise and fall don't seem to fit his criteria. But overall, it's a well-written, interesting, and thought-provoking book which will no doubt continue to fuel the debate about the sustainable and sensible use of the world's resources and the possible social consequences of failing to do so..

B00006879E|3.0|Is Maroon 5 great? No.  Is Maroon 5 bad? No. Is their CD worth buying? Absolutely not. <br /> <br />I first heard this in my friends car when we were on a long car ride. We listened to this CD the whole time, only I didn't know what CD it was. When I first heard it, I thought it was okay. It was different, and kinda catchy. But by the end of the car ride (two and half hours) I was ready to chuck the CD out the window. At school a couple of days later my friend was all excited because she had gotten the new Maroon 5 CD, did I have it? I had never heard of Maroon 5. My friend went on and on about how great they were, and since I usually like the same music she does, I went home and listened to sample on itunes, discovering it was that CD I had listened to in the car! THIS is what all my friends were talking about? It's not a bad CD or anything, its just...not great. And it gets old FAST. In fact, I've heard She Will Be Loved more times on the radio than I care for.  <br /> <br />I think Maroon 5 is definetely a passing fad.
B000001ESP|5.0|this is the quintessential rush album.  I am a pretty big fan of rush, but i can see why people might be uninterested in them.  Not all people can get into them, mostly because of Geddy's voice and the occasionally trite songwriting.  Rush's real strength lies in their instrumentals, which are all consistently brilliant works.  If they made an album with half of the songs instrumental tracks, they couldn't go wrong (Listen to YYZ off of this cd for starters!).  Listen before you buy, but seriously get this if you are at all intrigued by the band.  Also explore Test for Echo, which is the album that got me started on Rush, and Permanent Waves, the album that came before this one.  Listen and get these albums, they have wonderful work.   <br />Or you could opt for one of the greatest hits packages, which have good selection.  It would probably be better to wait for a hits package with their 90's stuff, a lot of which is really good (Almost everything they make is really good!)  But no matter what, get this first before anything else.
B0000012XC|5.0|For those who are not too familiar with Kempff, he is generally regarded as one of the most reputed Beethoven interpreter after Schnabel. Gulda was supposed to succeed them and was somehow stopped short. However, in Kempff, just like most pianists of the older generation and unlike Michelangeli who almost always played a piece the sme way even after 30 years, there is a strong element of improvisation, an element in the making of music which make him sound so fresh and spontaneous which left even Brendel way behind. And according to Menuhin, Kempff didn't exactly worship Beethoven, he loved him and took him as bosum friend. So, his playing is so inspired that it never fails to remind us of some transcending church music.    Having said that, Kempff even in the 50s, was never quite as dynamic as Gulda; whereas some may instead find Schnabel's Beethoven even more instructive and not at all less inspired. In his own way, Schunabel loved and worshipped Beethoven. But Schnabel's are all historic recordings and I tend to take it as an exceedingly valuable textbook that one should often go back to and fro from from phrase to phrase. My no.1 choice for these sonatas is always Backhaus, something that you can finish in one go, as though all the sonatas are part and piece of one great work (Decca, in wonderful stereo sound. Some may find Arrau's early Beethoven sonatas boring and Gilel's (which is not exactly a whole cycle in any event) not soulful enough, however much conviction he had for them. And to be honest, I have never finished Brendel's and I have never even tried Ashkenazy's Beethoven except his piano trio with Perlman and Harell and somehow I just stopped there...       Roughly speaking, Kempff's 50s cycle is more energetic, fiery and forceful, wheras his 60s is more colourful, more sublime, and with more subtleties. However, as far as the recorded sound is concerned, there is the difference of more than one whole generation, so that the ordinary music lovers maynot find the 50s recording delightful or acceptable at all; whereas few could really complain against the sound of the 60s.    So, if you are a pianist, or if you are a fan of Kempff, you probably will get both his 50s and 60s recordings: for like most great pianists or indeed most great musicians, every time they play, it is going to be different and they are all instructive and inspiring in their own way. I myself grapped both. But if your emphasis is on the early sonatas, it is better to get the 60s.

B000026C3T|5.0|A lot of years ago I had the original Led Zeppelin Remasters 3-CD set.  I sold it to get money toward rent during one of my summers of irresponsibility.  My fianc just got me this 2-CD set for Christmas to replace the one I had.  I was kind of like \\"Uh, you got the wrong one!\\" at first, but then I realized that the only difference was that this set didn't include the CD that contained interviews with the band.  I wasn't so mad after that because I never listened to that anyway.  Also, this set comes in a much more reasonable case. <br /> <br />I recommend this set to any Led Zeppelin fan because it includes most of their really good songs.  The only song I wish were on here but isn't is Tangerine.  No big deal, really.  And I'd rather have to haul around two CDs with all of the good songs on them than six CDs that have all of my favorites here and there.   <br />
B00007E8O5|5.0|It's shameful how many critics and fans alike slept on the album. Even more shameful that Roadrunner didn't bother to promote what was easily one of the best hard rock albums in the past 5 years. It's certainly one of the most harrowing creative expressions of a man's grief I've ever heard. While \\"Boggy Depot\\" was Jerry's attempt to break away from the Alice sound, DT 1&2 was him fully embracing it and taking it to a haunting, gorgeous new level, that I daresay he would not have been able to do if Layne Staley had survived. But Layne is certainly all through this album -- there are moments where Jerry is undoubtedly channeling Layne in the harmonies on \\"Psychotic Break\\" and all through \\"Pig Charmer\\" which seem to be Jerry's attempt at getting into Layne's head during those past few years of his life.  But I also see why this album didn't blow up --its occasionally self indulgent and sometimes so morose its unaccessable to casual listeners. But I say, screw the casual listeners. This album was made to be absorbed. (BTW Disk 1 is great, but Disk 2 is jaw-dropping)

0060989157|4.0|I'll be honest - I've never thought much of Motley Crue. Although I'm sure Nikki Sixx would beg to differ, they were a mainstream metal/rock act, something I've never really gone for. They lacked energy and ability to my tastes.<br /><br />However, when their hedonistic, frantic and often sad lives are put on paper it is hard to ignore them. True, they are self-pitying, selfish, spoilt rock stars who used women for sex and jokes and showed no gratitude to the men who worked hard for them to tour and record, but (aside from the fact that that's why this is such addictive reading) you do warm to them. And when one reads of the problems they dealt with in their lives, you do feel a great sense of sympathy.<br /><br />It's also obvious (to me at least) that they are all very repentent of the worst things they did. Well, maybe not, but this is still fun to read. If you're expecting the new Shakespeare, look somewhere else. If you just want fun, then buy this book regardless of whether or not you like the band.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is arguably the greatest hip hop release ever, and definitely the greatest of the 90s.  I am not a big fan of Nas, but his lyrical expertise on this CD is mind blowing.  It is not only Nas who shines on this CD.  AZ also squeezed in an excellent verse in \\"Life's a B***h\\", the only guest appearance on the disc.  The production is also top notch, with beats provided by Large Professor, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, and DJ Premier.  The songs range from cooled out (\\"Life's a B***h\\") to retrospective (\\"One Love\\") to gangster tales (\\"NY State of Mind\\") to just plain bumping (\\"Halftime\\").  This is a short disc, just 10 tracks and one of them is an intro.  Despite the fact that the disc only lasts about 40 minutes, it is a rare occasion to get to the end of the CD.  There is absolutely no filler in here.  The only reason there is to skip a track is to get to your favorite song.  Nas dropped out of school and was only a teenager (I think) when he made this.  None of this is apparent though, because of how good his lyrics are.  His lyrics are complemented with a spitfire flow.  The Nasty Nas in Illmatic is doubtlessly better than the Nas Escobar that we see nowadays.  This disc is for any lover of hip hop that wants to take it back to the old days where the lyrics you kicked meant more than the size of your bling.
1400034779|4.0|The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is the delightful first story of Precious Ramotswe, a single woman in Botswana who opens a detective agency and is immediately besieged with calls for help.  Precious helps a woman to find her husband, shows another that a man is really just after her money, and tries to determine if someone has been the victim of witchdoctors.  Precious is a likable character, and I think it is her warmth that makes the book work so well.  She was once, at a much younger age, the victim of bad judgment herself, when she got married too quickly to the wrong man.  Precious now has the attentions of a few men who aren't so sure she should stay single. <br /> <br />This is a fun, quick read - a delightful story.   <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|It takes many pot shots at George W. Bush and his chronies.  As biased as it is, it outshines in substance anything coming from such right-wing nutballs like Sean Insannity and Rush Limberger.<br /><br />The best part of the movie to me was when the secret service approached Michael Moore who was conducting an interview accross the street from the Saudi embassy.  Talk about impeccable timing.<br /><br />To the right-wing zealots who have negatively reviewed this movie without having watched it, I suggest you rent it and decide for yourself.  Perhaps you will be inspired to shake off the effects of congenital disciplitis that seems to pervade what is left of your intellect.  The fact of the matter is, that conservatives don't want to know the truth and Michael Moore is hated because he undermines their attempts subterfuge of the common American.  Yeah, it is too bad that the movie didn't result in George W. Bush being a one term Republican.  One thing I'll give credit to Bush for.  He's got this atheist praying again.  Praying for the health of all the supreme court justices (with the exception of Scalia and Thomas).<br /><br />One last thing.  I thought the footage from Iraq was especially interesting.  I saw a side of the war that you won't see on FoxNews (PRAVDA) ever.  You watch those segments and wonder why we are so popular in Iraq.
B000683VI4|1.0|I waited for months for this movie to come out on DVD. A friend suggested that I read the book and I coulnt put the book down. I read it in 3 days and cried through many parts of the book. The characters in the book didn't match the movie at all. Never in the book does it portray Allie to be a rich bitch with the temper of Satan; Nor does it portray Noah to be some \\"bad boy\\" with an attitude. The book portrays Allie to be sweet, pure, innocent, and confused about her feelings. Not stuck up at all. Noah is described as a romantic boy who is totally in love with Allie. Then she comes back and he is so happy, not pissed off at her that she is toying with his emotions. If I would have never read the book, I would have been very lost and would have lost interest in this movie quick. There were many relevant parts of the book that were left out of the movie. The letter that was written by Allie once she found out about her illness so that Noah could read it when she couldn't remember him any longer. Reading it in a book had such an impact on me. The book describes a love so deep and intense, something that you only find once in your life. The movie describes a couple of teens who have a dysfuctional relationship by hitting each other and they both drank heavily through the movie.   <br />It takes place in the 1940's where women were not assertive as Allie was and a woman seducing a man was taboo. Most women waited until they were married to have sex and the man was always the dominant one. I do have to say that James Garner played an awesome part as the older Noah. Other than that, I didn't \\"feel\\" it like I felt it through the book.  <br />My condolences to Nicholas Sparks for hacking his movie and turining it into a joke.  <br />Joanne Kovacs <br />Detroit, Michigan
B00003CXA6|4.0|I really enjoy this movie.  The depiction of how the battle evolved, and how Lee's overconfidence doomed his invasion was quite an accomplishment.  Pickett's charge was especially moving.  I thought Berenger did a great job of playing the role of General Longstreet and many of the other parts were performed admirably.<br /><br />One gripe I have is the beards.  Some of them were so phoney looking I couldn't help myself from laughing.  If they were to do it over again, they would need either a new make-up artist or make the actors grow a beard for the movie.<br /><br />Another thing I really like about the movie is the score.  Truly moving music to accompany a military drama that shaped the course of events in our country.
038551123X|5.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is an absolutely fantastic novel. Thrilling and suspenseful, yet original.  I've read many serial killer/murder/suspense novels, and this is by far the best.  Lindsay takes the reader into the dark and troubled mind of Dexter (a full time blood spatter analyst and a part time serial killer) and brings understanding and empathy for the character despite his \\"evil doings.\\" This novel has an excellent flow from beginning to end, and is extremely hard to put down.  Really recommended read!

B000000W3G|5.0|Now I know that many will disagree with me when I say that the Smashing Pumpkins are undoubtedly one of the best alternative rock bands in the history of music, standing alongside other greats such as Pink Floyd and The Beatles. The Smashing Pumpkins have always been an integral part of my life because everytime I made a triumph or suffered a defeat, I was always listening to one of their songs, and each album brings back a distinct memory of a great time in my past. While I love 'Siamese Dream', 'Mellon Collie' carries to this day an unshakable atmosphere and literally enthralls you in its epic scope, tune after tune tinged with either disdain or anger, oftentimes both. Note that 'Mellon Collie' was released before 'Adore', an album which many critics had deemed the beginning of the band's death throes. However, in the recording sessions for 'Mellon Collie', the band churned out a massive output of songs, enough to fill 4 CDs of original material. Though rejected, these unreleased songs were eventually fed into signals, and thus collected in 'The Aeroplane Flies High' box set. Let me tell you, if you are a major Pumpkins fan or just a rock fan in general, you should do yourself a favor by listening to this. Life is too short to pass this up. In my opinion, not only does 'Aeroplane' hold up to its predecessor as a companion piece, but actually surpasses it. With me, I never had to skip a single track, not even 'Pastichio Medley', a truly chaotic flurry of various guitar riffs that assaults your eardrums for 28 straight minutes. In fact, I think the last two discs mark where they truly soar above the alternative rock world, and stare down on it as a whole almost like gods. In 'Last Song' however, I couldn't help but feel that this was where the original Pumpkins were truly saying farewell, since the band would begin to shatter and never be the same all too soon afterward. 'Transformer' is probably the last time you will ever hear the band sound the way it does again,despite the commendable work they did with 'Machina'. All in all, unless you get it off eBay or score the MP3s, it's very well worth the listen.
B0006MT314|5.0|The OTH Soundtrack is a good cd. Every single song is great! My favorite song on the cd is \\"When The Star Goes Blue\\" by Tyler Hilton and Bethany Joy Lenz. Their voices together is amazing! I would recommend everyone buying this cd and also Tyler Hilton's CD*The Tracks of Tyler Hilton*!! This cd is for any oth or non oth fan!
0393317552|5.0|This is a great read, so long as you don't get bored by detail (I don't!). The author is very capable of taking a seemingly boring topic, and creating an entire book around it.  <br />To any person who thinks human variables trump geography and other environmental variables, it important to remember that without the geography to creates the environment that people operate in. I know it sounds stupidly simple, but think about it. One person could not dominate Europe for a great period of time, because of Europe's geography. One person could, however, control all of China, because of China's geography. Thus, without the geography to create the environment, there is no way for any one person to affect the future of the continent.
0393307050|5.0|Sparked by a belated viewing of the movie, I've also come late to the novels--which is unfortunate, because after reading through this first installment, I was blown away.  Jack Aubrey's world at first seems foreign and strange:  all the nautical terms, the sails, the masts.  As well it probably should to a twenty-first-century landlubber like me.  But by the end of the book, the world seems familiar, even if the sails and masts don't exactly fall into place in the mind yet (I've still got plenty of novels in which to pick that up).  Aubrey and Maturin are amazingly crafted characters, whom O'Brian sketches brilliantly--even while leaving some areas mysterious for later revelations.  O'Brian's writing sparkles.  To wit:  \\"the grey stench of a crapulous dawn\\" or \\"the indefinable frontier between personal animosity and anonymous warfare.\\"  The stern shipboard discipline, the confinement of the ship, the camraderie among the crew, the uncertainty of combat, the exploits of shoreleave--it's all here.  My heart leapt during the first engagement, when the crew spied cannon flashes across the open sea, followed by the boom of the firing.  This is simply a thrill to read.  I look forward to more drama and excitement in the rest of the series.
0684833395|5.0|Some people judge satire on how funny it is.  This is unquestionably one of the funniest books you will ever find.  However, what makes this a classic, for me, is the force and power of its insights.  It is powerful because it is true.  It is not afraid to speak the truth.  Catch 22 sustains a high level of devastating truth page after page.  In this it is greater than any other modern novel I've read.  In future generations, as long as there are people who are able to read and understand, this book will stand with Jonathan Swift, Rabelais, and Cervantes as one of the greatest satires.  I'm not saying it is their equal, but it is definitely in their class.  One last observation for those who know, or who want to know -- \\"T.S. Eliot\\".
B00027JZ3E|5.0|I recently saw this movie again after having seen it in high school when I was 15. It's amazing how differently you experience it 16 years later when you're all grown up, but yet it's still very enjoyable to watch. The first time around, I thought the overall coolness/hip factor was through the roof (rehabilitated high school geek. Sue me), with the music and the humor and attitude. This time around, the kitch (sp?) factor was what kept me glued to the set, while the cinematography still held up.  This movie still has a great visual presence all these years later.  Casting seems a little odd when you think about it today.  To see actors of the caliber of Kiefer Sutherland, Diane Weist, and Jason Patric in a movie with the two Coreys and that guy who played Bill in \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\\"  seems like a weird mix, but back then they all had a good screen chemistry together, believe it or not.  Although the movie was revered for it's soundtrack, which had a great mix of songs, I don't know if I would have chosen some of those artists for a rock and roll horror movie.  The setting for the movie had more of a punk/metal/goth/glam look and feel to it, which I don't think Elton John really fits well with.  Also, in one part of the movie, you see people headbanging to some poppy saxaphone music act led by a muscle-bound oily boy with a ridiculous looking super-mullet who looks like Michael Bolton on steroids.  All I could think was that it should have been someone like Glenn Danzig or Corrosion of Conformity or somebody who fit the whole vibe/setting a little better.  Also notice later in the movie that when they take Michael to make his first kill in the campfire scene, they have punks and skinheads dancing around a bonfire to a Run DMC remix of Aerosmith's \\"Walk this Way.\\"  I think in the real world if you were punk or skinhead and you were caught listening to rap music, they would confiscate your doc martens and make you walk home naked, dragging the stone of shame behind you (d'oh!).  heh-heh-heh, good times....
B000002KDX|5.0|Three guys,three guitars. One of the guitars is a twelve-string. Great sound from three guitars played at the same time. Imagine this band's Warner Bros. labelmates Peter,Paul & Mary all playing guitars. America sort of carries the PP&M sound. From this album comes one of 1972's best songs,A HORSE WITH NO NAME. I also like RIVERSIDE,SANDMAN,HERE and I NEED YOU. All the other songs are very good. I pledge allegiance to this band,which all members hail from America,and to the Republic,for which they stand,one nation,under God,indivisible,with liberty and justice for all.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is just great. It's really good.. Here's my review: <br /> <br />1. Intro <br />2. We Don't Care 5/5 - A great song, good chorus and a cool song <br />3. Graduation Day <br />4. All Falls Down 5/5 - One of the best songs on the album, really good. <br />5. I'll Fly Away  <br />6.

B00005NNMK|5.0|This was the album that got me into Europe, although it's not their very best album.  Of course the title track is a classic hit, but songs like \\"Carrie\\", \\"Rock the night\\" and \\"Cherokee\\" were big hits also.  The entire album is great.  Europe does a sensational job of combining keybords with guitars on this album and Joey Tempest delivers a great vocal performance.  This isn't their hardest rockin' album, but it's well balanced.  \\"The Final Countdown\\" is a melodic AOR album from a band whose majority of recordings were in the Hard Rock genre.  Many people think of Europe as a keyboard band, but actually 4 of their 6 albums are much heavier and guitar driven.    To \\"rock lover 69\\" below: You are way off base with your immature criticism of this band and it's fans.  Europe makes great music, and music certainly doesn't have to be evil and nasty to be likeable.  Why does it have to be \\"metal\\" as you define it?  What difference does it make what the band's nationality is?  Europe is cool because they are talented and have an excellent melodic sound which many people love, and this has nothing to do with their nationality!  Ever heard of Van Halen (Dutch), Def Leppard (English), or Bon Jovi (American)?? LOTS OF ROCK BANDS ALL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE A MELODIC SOUND.  Learn to appreciate things for what they ARE, not for what they ARE NOT.  Maybe one day when you become an adult you will understand this.  Give Europe another try in about 10 years.

B000002VTE|3.0|While I have to agree with those who say the 5 star ratings are too much (too many songs seem to be overlong or burdened with unnecessary instrumentation or extended, droning sections..), those giving it the weakest ratings didn't really listen to it either.<br /><br />There are some wonderful tunes here off and on, albeit buried under lots of psychedelic windowdressing. Immediate favourites for me are \\"I Think I'm in Love\\", \\"Broken Heart\\" and \\"Cool Waves\\".<br /><br />The extended free jazz portions of \\"Cop Shoot Cop\\", although they may grow on me with time, I suspect will always be too long before they resolve into melody near the end of the 17 minute track.<br /><br />If you, like me, came here because of suggestions that Brian Wilson's spirit may be heard in the music, then you probably should skip this...it won't be the concise pop you're probably after. But if you can also appreciate more out there experimental work, this may be your bag. Best bet is to see if your local library has it and give it several spins to see how you feel about it.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars...I'll try and revisit this in a year or so after I've had more time to \\"live with it\\" and see how I feel then...

B00008PW3Q|3.0|Buckingham and Nicks return to the band. So is it the 2nd coming of the \\"golden years\\"? Well, yes...and no.<br /><br />In the producer's chair, Buckingham is his usual avant-garde self which means it keeps the Mac from turning into a complete AC \\"soccer mom\\" group but it also too often means artsy-fartsy indulgence. And Christine McVie isn't here (the story is she wanted to spend more time at home), and as another reviewer perceptively points out, her harmonies and clear-eyed pop sense would have helped balance out Nicks' mysticism and Buckingham's avant-garde noodling.<br /><br />It's not all dross. \\"Peacekeeper\\" couples a great hook, a tinge of Lindsey's GOOD experimentation (the answering \\"oh-oh-oh-oh\\" in the hook) and the exactly right length. I can't imagine how this could be improved. \\"Say you Will\\" shimmers,too, although it would be better without the kiddie choir (fading around 3:15 does the trick). Among the non-singles, \\"Miranda\\" has a great hook but unneeded guitar histrionics at the end taints it. (again, fading at 3:30 would save it..) \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" is a winner, too. Several more modest numbers acquit themselves well (\\"Steal Your Heart Away\\"),\\"Thrown Down\\",\\"Smile at You\\") but could've been high quality with more finetuning.<br /><br />Now on to the bad points: \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave\\" shows the wheels coming off for Lindsey. His falsetto in the verses tends to be grating and the song runs about 40 seconds too long for some metallic guitarshredding that should have been just an 8 second fade. The round idea in the chorus is a good one, but it's stacked so busy you can't pick all the parts out without the aid of the liners. Production tricks on \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" (the 'voice in a tin can' alterna-sound on Stevie's voice) to make them sound hip just sound out of place. \\"Illume\\" is another 9/11 memorial song, this one tied to images of Nicks lighting incense (that's what \\"Nag Champra\\" is), \\"Red Rover\\" wastes a lovely flamenco influenced guitar part on gibberish lyrics, \\"Come\\" waits too long for a hook and \\"Running through the Garden\\" is pop psychology drivel.<br /><br />This CD runs about 80 minutes long (double album length) and like most double albums, it would benefit from editing. Were the weaker stuff dropped entirely, and some of the songs faded sooner to get rid of extraneous soloing, this would be around 45 minutes and a solid 4 stars. Maybe they can get Christine out from behind the ironing board for the next one...lyrics, \\"Come\\" waits too long for a hook and \\"Running through the Garden\\" is pop psychology drivel.

B0006399FS|4.0|I preface this review by saying that I have not been a fan of U2 for very long. I've heard their songs on and off all my life, but it wasn't until I started paying attention to the lyrics of some of their songs from ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND that I became interested in the band. Since that time I've researched the band fairly well and have come to appreciate their music.<br /><br />There are many who claim that HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB is a throw-back to U2's roots. Musically, this is partially true. About half of the tunes on the album remind one of the music U2 was making on their first few albums (most of the rest of the songs are fairly original in their content, except for \\"Vertigo\\" which is a pop song made to market). Many of those who criticize this claim, fail to recognize the reason HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB is an album most like U2's earliest albums: the unblatant Christian spirituality. Just read the titles: \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"Love and Peace Or Else\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"All Because of You\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", \\"Original of the Species\\", and \\"Yahweh\\". The titles alone are seeped in Christian symbology and allusions. Read the lyrics of the songs and this becomes even more clear. For the majority of their career, U2 has been a Christian praise band, but one that isn't afraid to meet the world and the media head-on. U2 came from Ireland and while still in their infancy, they weren't tainted by the Christian ghettos so prevalent across America. And thus one of the most popular rock bands ever formed arose.<br /><br />I like HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB. I find many of the songs powerful and moving.  The album isn't as good as some of U2's other efforts, but it's still good and illustrates the bands willingness to play around with form and style. The only song I really don't like much on the album is \\"Vertigo\\" but that song has meaning too--it's as though Bono and the boys knew the song would be overplayed, but still left a message for those who would truly listen.  My other favorites on the album include:<br /><br />\\"Miracle Drug\\"<br /><br />\\"Love and Peace Or Else\\"<br /><br />\\"One Step Closer\\"<br /><br />\\"Original of the Species\\"<br /><br />\\"Yahweh\\"<br /><br />Overall, HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB is a good album to listen to by a great band.  By the way, how do you dismantle an atomic bomb?<br /><br />Answer:  \\"Love and peace. Love and peace.\\"w the song would be overplayed, but still left a message for those who would truly listen.  My other favorites on the album include: <br /> <br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" <br /> <br />\\"Love and Peace Or Else\\" <br /> <br />\\"One Step Closer\\" <br /> <br />\\"Original of the Species\\" <br /> <br />\\"Yahweh\\" <br /> <br />Overall, HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB is a good album to listen to by a great band.

B0006399FS|1.0|It's about time that people have wised up and see U2 for the joke that they have become. Despite This moronic CD was number 1 in the USA, surely most copies end up in the used bin after people hear how crappy it is. U2 are finished as musicians, no matter hype and all that bulls**t propaganda. They can't write decent songs anymore, period. As a fan pointed out, this garbage is just COPY-PASTE from ATYCLB. Plus Bono can't sing anymore. Shame on U2  <br /> <br />HTDAAB is the very proof that U2 are so popular that talent is no longer a factor. Straight garbage. I can't believe some people pretend to like this drivel, because 'it's U2 !!'. By the way there is a kid who keeps on writtin five star reviews hereat amazon for the sake of boostin the average I really pity that kid.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0465043550|2.0|While this book may be an interesting read from a purely intellectual point of view, it offers no practical advice in terms of investment decisions, other than to point out that  financial markets can be volotile and risky - something which is obvious to any investor.  <br /> <br />A much more useful theory of fractals in the financial markets is \\"The Elliott Wave Principle\\" by Frost and Prechter (1978).

B000683VI4|5.0|This is to all the guys out there--by this for your girl for Valentine's Day and she will be putty in your hands! :) Especially if you watch it with her! <br />This is such a wonderful love story I cannot begin to describe it! It's not sappy, but very entertaining! Such as when Noah (Ryan Gosling) hangs from the ferris wheel in order to get Ally (Rachel McAdams) to go out with him.  Come on girls, we all wish for a guy who would do that for us! :) And when they see each other again after all those years! Oh, you can cut every emotion out there with a knife! :) :)  <br />Aside from the fact I am a chick and this is an ideal chick flick, I was very impressed with Rachel McAdams in this movie.  We all remember her playing snotty, popular cheerleaders in Mean Girls and The Hot Chick.  How refreshing it is to see her in such a wonderful role to help spread her wings as an actress!  She is truly talented.  Not to mention I think she looks better as a brunette. :)  We all remember Ryan Gosling in a small part in Remember the Titans and as a teenage killer in Murder By Numbers, and this movie definitely put him at the top for Hollywood's Most Eligible Bachelors!  <br />Watch it with friends, your lover, by yourself...just buy this movie! You wont' regret it!
0385510454|4.0|On the positive side, the plot of this novel moves at supersonic speed.  I've read a great many so-called international thrillers, but I haven't found one that moves this fast since \\"The Day of the Jackall.\\"  Unfortunately, the speed of the plot is also a negative, since so many unanswered questions are left in the wake. <br /> <br />Other reviews have examined the plot in excruciating detail, so I won't go into any of that--except to say that most of the unanswered questions about the plot begin with the word \\"Why.\\"  And there are several.  A writer, of course, does not have to answer all the whys.  Still, the reader should not be left in a puzzled state.  Why pardon Backman?  Why would his death tell the CIA anything worthwhile for the future?  Why not have him killed immediately if it has to be done eventually?  Why send him to Italy when there were far cheaper alternatives?  Why spend the money on language lessons?  Why waste taxpayer money on food, lodging, clothes, and all those endless, endless cups of espresso?  Does Occam's Razor not apply to novels of intrigue?  Of course, it it did, the novel would be about ten pages long. <br /> <br />Despite all this, the novel is worthwhile as a study in pace and for its atmosphere.  My disappointment is that it could have been better--much, much better--with a little more thought on the part of writer and editor. <br /> <br />
B00005J6SZ|4.0|Madonna's sophmore effort proved to be one of Madonna's most successful efforts. Selling over 10 million copies (second to The Immaculate Collection), this album actually proves to be her weakest. I just finished listening to it in it's entirety and honestly some songs are shameful. Of course, we have the classics but the other songs are 2nd rate fillers. Pretender, Shoo-Be-Do & Stay are disposible. The others are eighties must haves. For those songs alone this album is essential for any Madonna fan or retro 80's collector.<br /><br />As far as the content: it's mostly about relationships on superficial levels, nothing deep. Most definitely, Madonna's music has progressively matured through out the years and for that we should be thankful.<br /><br />For Madonna's best check out, Madonna (debut), The Immaculate Collection, Erotica, Ray of Light & Music.<br /><br />Edited on 6/18/2013: This albums has been revisited a few time and it actully got better. Stay is now on of the favorites and Pretender really grew on me.
B000002579|5.0|Most people nowadays who own a Kansas album that isn't one of the (too) many \\"Best Of\\" collections crowding big-box department stores and/or truck stops usually have either \\"Leftoverture\\" or \\"Point Of Know Return\\". <br /> <br />Perhaps I'm biased, since this was the first Kansas album I bought as a 14-year-old in 1980, but I think this is where it all came together for Kansas, both artistically and commercially. <br /> <br />Their earlier albums certainly had some wonderful moments, but suffered from a lack of consistency and sometimes duff production. Here the production (by Jeff Glixman) and songwriting (chiefly by Kerry Livgren) are both very good. <br /> <br />Often throughout Kansas' long career the harder, guitar-based rock and Yes/Genesis/ELP influenced progressive rock have sometimes been at odds with one another. Here they are on about equal parity. Richard Williams is quite prominent throughout and Livgren steps out from behind his keyboards to riff away moreso than in the past. All good. <br /> <br />There are also songs here that survive in the club-gigging Kansas repertoire to this day: \\"The Wall\\", \\"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\\", and, of course, \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\". <br /> <br />\\"Carry On...\\" has turned out to be both a blessing and an albatross round the neck for Kansas. It was certainly the song that broke them on more than a regional level (proof of this is found in a truncated version of the song being featured in the Henry Winkler/Harrison Ford/Sally Field Vietnam-vet 1977 film \\"Heroes\\"). However, along with \\"Dust In The Wind\\", it also seems to be a song they can't get away from. I saw them at a club gig about 10 years ago and except for the hardcore fans, like myself, the only time the crowd really responded was during this song. Unfortunate. <br /> <br />There are also some lesser-known gems here, like \\"Opus Insert\\" and the (admittedly overindulgent) \\"Magnum Opus\\". Almost everyone who has seen a Kansas gig will remember Steve Walsh opening with a few bars of \\"Howling At The Moon\\". <br /> <br />If you're a real Kansas fan, you've got this. <br />If you're a casual Kansas fan, you've probably got this. <br />If you're any other kind of fan, you should get this, but also check out their other stuff, including the John Elefante-era material and the \\"Power\\" album and those that came after. <br /> <br />This band is still quite good.
B000065V1V|3.0|Those who discovered Heathen when it first came out did not have the vantage of hindsight, or the ability to compare it with the subsequent release, Reality, and I think had they the opportunity they would have not judged it as well against the more satisfying later work, as opposed to its pedestrian predecessors, Hours and Outside. <br /> <br />I first discovered Reality and then searched out Heathen given many of the reviews here, and really don't believe Heathen measures up to the later work.  With the exception of \\"I Would Be Your Slave\\" with its compelling, driving mood, Heathen is a forgettable record.  The tracks don't distinguish themselves in any way.  However, with Reality, Bowie has come up with a record with track after track of memorable music.  The energy and excitement of Reality is missing in Heathen, as if Heathen was the work in progress and Reality was the finished product. <br /> <br />One gets the sense that Bowie was rediscovering a variety of things with Heathen, but coalesced his creativity and Visconti partnership with Reality into great music.  Heathen is for the completest, but Reality is one of Bowie's best.
B00076ZZ84|2.0|The huge hype around DualDiscs is the option for multichannel (\\"surround\\") mixes of albums to be presented on the DVD side. Think of it - a multichannel mix of an entire album that can be played on anyone's DVD player, assuming you've got your DVD player hooked up to a nice surround sound system.<br /><br />And yet, strangely, this DualDisc of Avril's second album is not available in multichannel, but rather is only in stereo! True, it is a slightly higher quality, and there are some videos on it, but where's the surround mix of the album?
B00006RCNW|5.0|\\"The Shield\\" made history by earning the most Emmy nominations ever for a basic cable drama series, with Michael Chiklis winning the coveted Emmy Award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series. I am now halfway through season one on DVD. The show is outstanding for many reasons. It is a police show. That is not uncommon. What is unusual is that the characters in the show are complicated human beings who have both good qualities and bad qualities. As in real life each person is not all good or all bad, but they are complex human beings capable of bravery, generousity, and other good qualities on one hand, and greed, deceit and even murder on the other hand. It is an excellent drama with good writing of the scripts and good acting. Another plus, is, of course with the DVD one does not have to sit through many commercials.
B0002EXH5E|1.0|Worst Megadeth album.  End of story.  Don't waste your money.  Get the remastered MD.45-The Craving(with Dave on vocals!) instead.  I bought Risk when it first came out and I wanted to cry.  If this was the direction they were headed, I would see what Metallica was doing at that time then.  Luckily, they got over that creative goof and started putting out the slammin' music again.  If you are new to the band, here is your mission: <br />Peace Sells, But Who's Buying <br />Rust in Peace <br />Cryptic Writings <br />The World Needs a Hero <br />Killing is my Business and Business is Good <br />Buy these first and listen to them until they are worn out.  Then: <br />The System has Failed <br />Youthanasia <br />Countdown to Extinction <br />And: <br />So Far, So Good, So What <br />This last one was when they were all pretty blasted on drugs and basically made the record to support the habit.  It shows in the music and the new drummer and guitarist are lousy. <br />Avoid Risk at all costs.  Even if it's offered to you for free or given to you by Aunt Fanny at Christmas.
B000000H3Z|5.0|that is what everyone was calling this album when it first emerged on american shores in 1989...REIGN IN BLOOD 2! Well, it isn't but it is the second best metal album after \\"Reign in Blood.\\" If you know squat about metal, you know \\"Reign in Blood\\" and \\"Beneth the Remains,\\" period! The Slayer/Reign influence is evident here but Sepultura truly came up with their own brand of death n destruction on \\"Beneath.\\" Every death/thrash/grind/spazz metal album was influenced by this, as well as \\"Reign\\" it's without a doubt Sepultura's best moment, and metal's hardest album. this album straddles the line between THRASH( Metallica, Anthrax ) and DEATH( Napalm Death, Obituary. ) The result? Man, gotta hear thjis for yourself!! It's a sham every fan of doo doo bands like Sevendust or Incubus or even Metallica's last album, who never heard \\"Reign in Blood\\" or \\"Beneath\\" need to get their wigs pushed back when this is popped into their stereos seriously!! I remember being a lil 15 year old metalhead and hearing all the hype about the \\"next Slayer from Brazil\\" and this album is CRAZY! Well, they hype is real like Slim Shady would say, when I first heard it I probably did a Beavis and Butthead esque \\"Whoaaaaaaaa hehe he hehehe this ROCKS heh hehe!!\\" Although bands like Carcass and Napalm Death may have gone to extremes in their vocals and sound...NOTHING is heavier than this here album! Not anything by Carcass, Napalm, Obituary, Terrorizer...and i love all thosebands! This is just the way it's supposed to be done! too bad we'll never hear another metal album as fresh or devastatingly brutal again! but come to think about it... that is probably what people said when Slayer did \\"Reign in Blood!\\"
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is just too smart and creative for its own good.  It sets the bar of greatest rap album so high that no other artist has yet to make an album that is on the level of this one.  I will admit that if you listen to this album now youll probly take it out the cd player before really giving it an honest chance.  Its one of those albums that you have to digest.  The more you listen the more it scares you because it just opens up and blossoms right in front of you.  Ive heard that in black colleges there studying this mans lyrics. \\"how crazy is that\\" If you have listen to this album and give it less than 5 stars then it can only be for one reason.  You listened to it once and didnt like the sound so you just disregarded it.  Im telling you it takes about 10 listens before you can actually get into it.  I sware that if nas was a writer he would be up there with the best of them.
B000002G7E|4.0|I liked the previous album, \\"Velvet Underground & Nico\\". After recording that album, they decided to ditch Andy Warhol (who produced and made the \\"peel the banana\\" album cover for the previous one) and Nico, disenchanted with her work with them, quit to have a solo career. So, Lou, Sterling, Maureen, and John decided to do whatever they wanted and made WL/WH. I love the do-it-yourself attitude that defined this album and I love the music. It's just that they were minimalistic in production. There are only six tracks and just about all of them feature distortion and feedback. I love distortion and feedback, but it gets really annoying if it much of it is that. I love the title track (which is about the effects of dope and meth and shooting them up with a transsexual), \\"The Gift\\" (a mix of a long, sludgy jam session with an eight-minute poem penned by Lou Reed but recited by John Cale about a man, suspicious of his girlfriend, who mails himself to her, with eerie results), \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" (first sung by John Cale, and then it becomes a duet with Lou Reed. It's about an aging woman and a strange operation [I don't get what this has to do with the legend of Lady Godiva, who rides a horse around town naked to protest her king husband's taxes]), \\"Here She Comes Now\\" (a two-and-a-half minute, soft song about the uncertainties of love. Nirvana made a cover version of the song.), the five-minute \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" (feedback, noisy guitars, lyrics of girlfriend), and the grand finale, \\"Sister Ray\\" (a 17-minute magnum opus about sex, drugs, violence, and rock-and-roll. All the sludge, lyrics, and feedback/distortion of the previous songs tie together in this one. It is considered to be the inspiration of the \\"pointless long jam session\\" music of the 1970's). I love all the songs of this album, except that they just did whatever they wanted. It's kind of a waste of money if you buy a non-EP album with six tracks. Also, the feedback wears out as the album goeson. Nevertheless, this \\"do-it-yourself\\" attitude was the spirit of the punk bands of the future.
B0000009SG|4.0|how could someone named andy state (seriously) that zappa is over rated - and give a g3 recording 5 stars ?
B0002234LS|3.0|This was Johnny Depp's first film ever since his nomination for Best Actor for POTC. We open up on a shot of a man sitting in his car and then he goes into a hotel room and sees his wife and goes nuts...the camera cuts away before we see what happens.<br /><br />The same man is visited by another man that says that he has plagerized his story, and that he will kill him if he doesn't credit him for it. He doesn't seem phased by it, and shrugs it off. Then strange things start happening, and He starts going crazy, and He then hires a private investigator and asks him to see what is going on and who is it that is doing to him. But, that messes up and then it sets up the strangest ending ever.<br /><br />Johnny Depp only carries the film to its maximum point. The film itself is wondering what to do next every scene. It has a hard time trying to follow a solid plot, and the ending, just weirds you out. I thought it wasn't one of the greatest of 2004 but it was entertianing and fun to watch Johnny Depp give another good performance.
0553208845|5.0|i have one grouse...most reviewers are not indians so they dont't seem to understand one basic point,A Brahmin is different from A Brahman.<br /><br />A BRAHMIN is a person who belongs to the priestly class or caste,he is one who is supposed to be well versed with the vedas and upanishads.Not every one can be a brahmin,he/she has to be born to brahmins to be a brahmin I.e its hereditary.<br /><br />A BRAHMAN is one who has realized himself and is in sync with the cosmos,he is also refered to as one with the cosmos.any one can become a brahman or one with the cosmos and doesnt have to do anything with the lineage.<br /><br />i would recommend works of Shri Adi shankara to understand more about Brahman.
B000000HSU|5.0|Along with \\"Age of Quarrel\\" by their \\"students\\" The Cro Mags, and \\"Victim in Pain\\" by Agnostic Front, this is the top 3 hardcore albums of all time. Many people, like Adrock of Beastie Boys, will say Bad Brains self titled ROIR debut is the best but I disagree, this is on that next ish. \\"Bad Brains' is indeed a great album, released in 1981, but 1983's \\"Rock for light\\" is just that much betetr. there are still those burts of hardcore and HR's infamous shrieks, but they sounds maturer, better, more focused, more dedicated to Jah Rastafari! This is Bad Brains in their prime! Already 4 plus years into their game, they hooked up with CARS frontman RIC OCASEK( hey, Ric knew and KNOWS hism music recognize! ) to produe and oversee the album...the result is some of the best hardcore/punk we have ever, and ever will see! Bad Brains always threw some reggae into the mix in their live show when the pit got too crazy...they masterly blend reggae n dub in between the shredders and it works FLAWLESSLY here! \\"Rally Round\\" and \\"The Meek\\" are some of the best reggae the Brains have ever done, and it's so heartfelt that it's not surprising that HR split just a year later to focus full time on reggae( check HR's solo debut \\"Human Rights\\" which is actually more funk and rock than reggae.) this is the album that everyone from Cro Mags to Madonna was inspired by...Madonna signed the Bad Brains 10 years later to her Maverick label. The Bad Brains didn't sound anything like The Clash but like The Clash melded punk n reggae, The Brains did HARDCORE n reggae. Hardcore is simply the next progression from punk, but The Brains are playing HARDCORE here and set the stage for the violent, unnerving NYHC movement which is epitomized on \\"Age of Quarrell.\\" The Brains continued to do hardcore from the heart, but even THEY couldn't resist the late 80's thrash influence of Metallica and Co....1989's great \\"Quickness\\" is evident of that. Everything after \\"Quickness\\" goes down, including the on again, off again HR and brother Earl on drums, like their students Cro Mags they just couldn't all get along. Today the Bad Brains play VERY seldomly and usually under the name SOUL BRAINS( I saw them in 2002 or 2003 at Irving Plaza NY. ) But if you rewind 22 years to this album, you'll see why they simply were one of NY's best, D.C's best and the WORLDS best bands!    <br />
B0006A9FMI|4.0|The movie is another masterpiece--Batou and Togusa investigate a series of gruelsome murders being commited by gynoids--cyborgs which have been designed for the sex trade. Condifering the current state of modern Japanese society, this film really hits home--with all of the mindblowing technology, the people of Innocence (and to a lesser degree, real life Japan) have become so wrapped up in high tech gadgets, they have started to forget what it means to be \\"human\\" There's more to life than stressing out over school exmas, stressful days at work, lack of some time to relax <br /> <br />In the movie, the extent of cyber and nano technology has rendered the value of human feelings almost to a moot point.Batou's only sense of humanity is when he feeds his dog, Togusa when he goes home to his family (as he only has some cyber brain implants) You'll se this when Batou is more than happy to take out an entire yakuza gang with a HUGE gun, while poor Togusa comes this close to getting killed by a pair of hand grenades (Batou saves him of course) <br /> <br />I love the movie, but whoever did the subtitles should be fired!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Super cool special effects a la Matrix-style and an interesting story line make this one of the better movies I've added to my collection. <br /> <br />The story line is an interesting twist of the family feud genre.  The story is compelling enough to hold up under the over-the-top effects.  While the Matrix-style effects are cool, they are becoming generally overdone in Hollywood as a whole.  Just my personal hangup that I'd rather have a little less stop-action/slow motion and more kick-butt in \\"real time\\" action. <br /> <br />Then there are the usual \\"laws of physics\\" hangups...a Deathdealer jumps from a tall building but doesn't crack the pavement when she lands.  Granted, she's a vampire and they are already living outside of the laws of nature, but is it too much to ask for a little more reality in the scifi aspects of a film?   <br /> <br />I thought the overall effects of the werewolves, or Lycans as they are called in the film, was decent but still not wholly believable in appearance.  It's hard for Hollywood to get the look of a werewolf right, so these guys were actually farily good compared to some. <br /> <br />Overall, the film was a fun ride and I look forward to the next installment.
B000000OQF|3.0|Answering your question: NO.<br /><br />By any stretch of your wildest imagination.
B0002IQHY8|2.0|I am a very long time Alan Parsons Project fan and I own every album that Alan Parson has been involved with.  In many cases, I purchased the records and replaced them with CD's when the format was intruduced. <br /> <br />This is the worse album ever!  I gave it two stars because I would rather listen to it than much of the rap music around today. This is not saying much because I would rather listen to a jack hammer on a construction site than most rap music! <br /> <br />If you like the old Alan Parsons Project stuff and thought that \\"On Air\\" was a good step back to those days, you will not like this album.  Go to itunes and listen to the first 30 seconds of \\"More Lost Without You\\" (Amazon has a clip of this song from the middle where it is a little easier to listen to).  If you like the instrumentation and sound of this track, you may like the album. I would say that the rich full sound that has been Alan Parson's trademark over the years is entirely missing.  Listen to the beginning of \\"A Recurring Dream Within A Dream\\" and compare it to the orignal Poe album.  The difference is not caused by the streaming audio! <br /> <br />This album may appeal to fans of techno or whatever genre this album is attempting to mimic.  It is not for the hard core Alan Parsons Project fan like myself.  I will be much more careful in checking out his work in the future.  Up until now, anything Alan Parson did was an automatic buy for me.  Nevermore!
B00005OWEG|5.0|The great film, APOCALYPSE NOW, although certainly not the greatest American Film ever made, plays much like America herself (himself?). Coppola said during the film's premier \\"the film isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam!\\" He certainly could be talking about his native country as well as his creation perfectly captures the glorious imperfections that is the United States.  <br /> <br />Especially now in its REDUX form. <br /> <br />Like America, APOCALYPSE NOW is a sea of mixed images and contradictions: it is frequently pretenious and obnoxious, exploitive and reflective, overbearing and white male dominated, carthatic and broad, bold and imperialistic, beautiful and unforgiving, mad, violent, reckless, sloppy, over stuffed with great ideas (some fullfilled-others half baked), exhilerating and mortifying, haunting and sentimental, holy and evil, deadly and vibrant, rough and cultured, exposing and yet filled with denial, terrifying and harrowing, reverent and still extremely defiant, plentiful and wasteful, independent yet slavish, liberal and somehow conservative in its world view and all these ingredients make the film ultimately fascinating and stunning.  <br /> <br />There has never been anything like it before or since. It is an experiement no film maker will ever be willing to gamble with again in the creation process. Like a true work of art, this film is unique and one of a kind. Coppola's film reaches the hallmark of many great works of art- it refuses to allow the viewer to sit on a philosophical fence.  <br /> <br />Because the film is pure cinema in its use of visual and sonic images to tell a story, Coppola forces the viewer to react firstly emotionally to the narrative (the intellectual side can be engaged later if need be). One will either hate it or love it-there will be no middle ground.  <br /> <br />This is much like the world's image of America as a country. All one has to do is look at the foreign press to realize we are viewed in such devisiveterms. Based too, on the many views of this film, the world is split as to whether or not this film is a work of a mad genius or an ugly and pretentious waste of time.  <br /> <br />In that respect, the only other film that comes close to NOW is in fact, Kubrick's 2001. For this reviewer, APOCALYPSE NOW is the film 2001 tries so desperately to be. Whereas I find Kubrick's film to be distant and cold, Coppola's film is the opposite: immediate and captivating.  <br /> <br />NOW is not the work of a cold visual genius, it is instead the work of a fevered madman desperately holding on to his camera in an effort to keep himself from falling into the abyss. Based upon his career since, Coppola didn't return from the jungle- much like America herself in oh so many examples.  <br /> <br />Although not a perfect film, APOCALYPSE NOW is a great film. It is the quintessential American Movie. <br />
B000001E18|5.0|This is one of the best albums to come out of the ninties. Breathtaking, stunning, worthy of adjectives not yet created. It must be played start to end, without skipping tracks to find your favorite track ( IMO, 'Zooropa', 'Lemon', 'Stay', 'The First Time' and 'The Wanderer' ).  <br /> <br />Like Pop, Zooropa is a bit strange because it's so different from mainstream music, but it's fantastic. You must be open to listening to music that's unlike anything else and be willing to give it a chance. By listening, I don't just mean allowing the music enter your ears; you need to HEAR the music for what it is and feel the artistic expression in it.  <br /> <br />Truly Recomended. Period <br /> <br />
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Training a 12-year old to be a 'cleaner' (a hitwoman) is not exactly high on the credibility or morality scale but it makes for a pretty engaging premise that, while occasionally stilted and odd, sports an energetic burst of freshness.<br /><br />The gunfights are stylish. The action is balletic -- slow-motion explosions, starkly lit bodies flying through the air. The hints of flirtations between the young girl and her trainer (Reno in a customary sombre gait) are teasing.<br /><br />Yet, the film manages to create a solemn tone by the end of it all. I've seen it a few times and always end up glued to it. Thanks perhaps to the way it's made.<br /><br />If you own \\"The Professional\\" that was released for the English-speaking market a few years ago, throw it out and get this full uncut version of the film as it delves into the relationship of the two main characters. This seemingly simple inclusion lends the film some serious drama that makes it a lot more enjoyable, if not credible.
B00006690G|5.0|I love this CD, listin to it all the time, actually its my fav!
0385510438|3.0|I'd given up on Grisham for many years because of past disappointments.  His first book, \\"A Time to Kill\\" was, in my opinion, his very best.  But his talents have eroded with the years and his politics seem to encroach upon his story telling.  Pat Conroy takes a backseat to no one in his leftist leanings but still manages to tell a wonderful well written story.      Grisham, few would argue, has the talent of a Pat Conroy, but one would hope he could at least provide an engaging read.  This story starts out OK - just OK, but then wanders inexplicable into not particularly well told completely unrelated stories.  I would guess that about 2/3 of the book is not directly related the legal \\"thriller.\\"    I will never again pick up a Grisham novel unless it is highly recommended by someone I respect.  My advice, find something more worthwhile, engaging and interesting to read.
B000001EAQ|5.0|How much you love this CD probably depends on the \\"flavor\\" of U2 that you like. It's clear most of silly teens whom are crazy for this sellout U2 2000 love their latest album and hate both Pop and Zooropa at the same time. Well, I'm one of those whom love 90s U2 and hate this sellout ATYCLB era.  <br /> <br />Let's talk about Pop. All in all a ground-breaking CD. This is an album that resists categorising. Rock ? Techno ? Euro ? is more than that. Is a whole new music scene. That's the reason why is so brilliant, IMO.  <br /> <br />It registers more as a masterpiece the more you actually get into it because it amazingly has so much unbelievable detail that there is something that always stands out that you didn't appreciate before. I mean when I hear this record now, I am just blown away by the amazing detail and that a band could come up with so much even in the span of one song. Think about how much time they spent in the studio. It's obvious that U2 work their asses off and deliver the goods.  <br /> <br />Zooropa showed their eclectic versatility but Pop is from a far more distant place.  <br /> <br />How they manage to do this is a mystery to me, but whatever technique they use to make their music like this nonetheless helps them create masterful works of musical art that have the power to stay in your brain and your heart for days after listening. And you probably won't go days without listening to it, the magnetic force of their music manages to pull you back for another listen every moment you are able.  <br /> <br />Truly Recomended. Period.  <br /> <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|this album is so incredible.  to be perfectly honest, it's quite possibly the most creative, unique, insanely genius thing I've ever listened to.  I play it practically all day every day.  I study with it, I read with it, I eat with it.  I sing it in the shower.  I'm not even kidding.  I am thinking about buying the album again just to give the band twelve more dollars. its that great.  Words fall short in describing it.  One listen and you'll see, The Mars Volta is like nothing ever before or ever will be.
0670033375|1.0|<br /> <br />We've all heard of Euro-trash - I'd like to coin a new phrase:  Academia-trash - for the sole purpose of describing works like this.   <br /> <br />Sure, everyone who is anyone raves about this book and others like it.  Most are fellow academic travelers on the road to mediocrity - leading the ill-informed public by the nose to their profound view of \\"how and why all things happen\\". <br /> <br />To me this is mere drivel - simplistic pop culture-like scribbling.  Pseudo-science wrapped in the guise of profundity.  A waste of time for any right thinking, concerned individual. <br /> <br />I grow so weary of this new wave of trendy, pop culture, pseudo-science books that is covering the landscape today.  It's indeed a shame that so many of these books are the product of ill-informed university professors.  It's a sad commentary on the level of true education in academia today.   <br /> <br />The only \\"dynamic\\" I see here is the dynamic of the uneducated flocking to a new pop-hit book that they \\"must have\\".  Notice I said \\"must have\\" and not the more commonly used \\"must read\\" - for don't kid yourself authors:  many who buy these works never actually work their way through them...    <br /> <br />This new wave of academia is so enthralled with its discipline-specific jargon and \\"in\\" cliques of self perceived enlightenment, that I wonder if they still remember how to spell \\"gobbley-gook\\"... <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|That so many people find this an album to slobber over just scares the hell out of me. There is NOTHING unique, ground-breaking, or remotely interesting on this album that justifies the praise. This will stand the test of the month, but certainly not the test of time. This is not \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Exile on Main Street\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\" so everybody just calm down. <br /> <br />Everyone that is giving this album five stars will praise it until they are \\"blown away\\" by the next Offspring or Blink 182 album.  <br /> <br />Go home.
B00006LIRI|1.0|Terrible, just terrible. Go and buy their most fantastic albums ever created, I mean, the experimental 90s era:    Achtung Baby - Zooropa - Pop.    If I were you, I wouldn't pay even 1 dollar to listen to those awful \\"new mixes\\" ( Discotheque, Staring At The Sun, Gone and Numb ). Go and listen to original versions instead !!. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Both Electrical Storm and The Hands That Built America are worthless, just filler singles - Hit and miss - in order to sell more copies of this shameful compilation.    If you're a REAL U2 fan, you should buy those brilliant 90s albums instead, trust me, you won't be dissapointed at all.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I enjoyed this CD very much, and was so glad to see a new release by Simly Red. Some of the tracks are classics they have redone, and others sample from other artists (like 'Sunrise', which is taken from Hall and Oates). The CD provides 1st class entertainment, and I love that I can listen to the entire CD without wanting to skip any tracks. IMO, there isn't a bad track on this.
0316172324|1.0|I picked this book up at Borders yesterday morning for something interesting to read.  Unfortunately, part-way through , I started  BLINKING uncontrollably... I then went into what I can only describe as a comatose state and didn't wake up until the very next morning - what a strange phenomenon!  Fortunately, since I was able to return this book for a full refund today, I believe that no permanent damage was done...    Now to the content:  Simplistic pop culture. Pseudo-science wrapped in the guise of profundity. A waste of time for any right-thinking, concerned individual.    I grow so weary of the AVALANCHE of trendy, pop-culture, pseudo-science books that is sweeping over the literary landscape today. Can someone please help me spell gobblely-gook?
B000050AMA|5.0|this album is incredible. it is my favorite crimson album and if u have listened to it u know why. from start to finish they will not let you down. the style is so different from anything else. dont let this album slip away from your collection. its a must have to any person who is appreciative of music.

Pointless, immature, cliche and monotonous. I cant imagine who's buying this besides prepubescent teenagers whom pretend to experience Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby times we really experienced in the 80s and 90s.  <br /> <br />U2 have no substance, and no ground to be creative on anymore. <br /> <br />PS: don't forget to buy and iPod and pay even thousands dollars for a ticket !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005A0N5|5.0|This album exemplifies some of the diversity that the band has taken through the years, although each album in itself is different from all the others, and most certainly from those out there.  Oceanborn just brings a lot to the table that you don't find elsewhere. <br /> <br />The album starts off with some nice songs, as Stargazers showcases the trademark operatic singing with the familiar melodic heavy metal.  Gethesmane makes use of more creativity in the melodic department, and Devil & The Deep Dark Ocean adds a little battling duet.  While these songs are good in themselves, the album starts to get ridiculous with Sacrament of Wilderness, with an epic arrangement that brings the fantasy-based theme of living free in the forests into the forefront - the melodic arrangement combined with the vocals makes for a yearning experience that is seldom found elsewhere.  The songs Passion and the Opera and Swanheart both showcase a little diversity in themselves, but the song after that, Moondance, is a completely different beast - it is essentially celtic metal, and it is a one of a kind instrumental that you cannot miss.  The Riddler is a nice diddly too, but The Pharoah Sails to Orion brings the duet concept in Devil & The Deep Dark Ocean into fruition.  The two songs afterwards, Walking in the Air and Sleeping Sun cannot also be missed, as they are some of the most fine examples of celtic influences of Nightwish out there. <br /> <br />In short, this album shows a lot of influences from celtic music, but binds them to their style in such a unique way that no other band can claim to have such creativity.  This is a must buy for any who love melodic songs, celtic, and for those who are looking for a special take on the overblown metal genre.  It can also be a great introductory album to Nightwish, as well as Wishmaster.
B000001EAQ|5.0|8 years later and I'm still impressed. Pop is widely regarded as the last great U2 album, and I agree. We really miss those risky and experimental times. <br /> <br />Now, this album won't be for everyone - but it bloody well should be - it's essential, it's avant garde, it's one of the best albums ive ever heard. The music is out-of-body, arrangements, production, art, etc, every single aspect is just unique. You won't find another U2 album as this one. <br /> <br />The whole album is just an experience, an amazing soundtrack of our lives. A must have. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00000FC5H|5.0|Of course I will give 5 stars to the best R&B band of all time. Being a fan of EWF, I wasn't disappointed with this CD at ALL. It includes all of the big hits.. \\"Shining Star\\", \\"September\\", \\"Boogie Wonderland\\".... all of them are HERE, so why get any other EWF compilation CD? This is a great start for anyone who wants to get into Earth, Wind and Fire or just good R&B in general.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Oh my this cd is soooooooo hot.  My eardrums are smokin' and so will yours.  David Foster and Humberto Gatica prove once again that their partnership in sound production has no rival for attention in my ears.<br /><br />Michael Bubl&eacute; and Nelly Furtado sing a sentimental samba duet that sealed my affection at track four.  \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" is so outstanding.  It starts with a gentle guitar by Heitor Pereira and spectacular flute by Dan Higgins.  The echo of Nelly Furtado's voice is lovely and her voice is so compatible with Michael's.  Then they sing together and her harmony with his is just incredible.<br /><br />I think the tempo changes and Big-Band arrangement of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" show off Michael Bubl&eacute; at his vocally versatile finest.  \\"The More I See You\\" is another smokin' swing treat.<br /><br />I was thinking at about track 8 with the saucy, latin \\"Save The Last Dance for Me\\" that there is just no way I can handle anymore musical tenderness today.  And then I hear the ballad \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" at track 9 (the piano by Randy Waldman creates mood du jour).  Jochem Van der Saag's keyboard and harmonica contributions on \\"How Sweet it Is\\" are remarkable at track 10.  I'm sure at that point in the disc I can't stand anymore when Chris Botti's trumpet and Michael's voice on \\"Song for You\\" reduced me to pathetic pile of pudding.  I was toast - both sides.<br /><br />I think this cd is even better than Michael's debut and I have to say his first cd blew me away.<br /><br />I will never tire of this audio heaven.  Never.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|How anyone can listen to this release and/or watch the DVD and not get a lump in your throat and/or a tear in your eye is beyond me.  I recommend the DVD release, also.  Eric Clapton, Sir Paul, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Ringo, and many other fine musicians including Harrison's son all paying tribute to the late and great George Harrison.  Excellent cd and dvd.

This is an annoying All That You Can't Leave Behind re-issue with another name !!!. <br /> <br />This sellout corporation can't be the same band whom wrote such songs as 'Sunday Bloody Sunday', 'Bad', 'Running To Stand Still', 'One', 'Stay', 'Where The Streets Have No Name', 'Pride', 'Please', 'Zooropa', 'The Wanderer', 'Surrender', 'Mofo', etc. Songs like 'One Step Closer', 'Sometimes', 'Love And Peace' or 'A Man And A Woman' are just pathetic. Pointless, immature, cliche and monotonous. I cant imagine who's buying this besides prepubescent teenagers whom pretend to experience Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby times we really experienced in the 80s and 90s.   <br /> <br />U2 have no substance, and no ground to be creative on anymore. <br /> <br />PS: don't forget to buy and iPod and pay even thousands dollars for a ticket !!! <br /> <br />
B00062IDCO|1.0|While the first half of Season Seven had some great episodes there was a downward spiral that started mid-season.  Too much focus was on Seven and the Doctor which is disappointing to those of us who also like the other characters. <br /> <br />The finale was a major letdown.  Borg?  Been done before ad nauseum in other episodes.  Time travel?  Again, \\"Timeless\\", \\"Future's End\\" and \\"Year of Hell\\" did it better. The Chakotay/Seven \\"relationship\\"? What were they thinking? The only saving grace to the finale was Mulgrew's performance as both the older and younger Janeway. <br /> <br />While I purchased all six of the other seasons I'm letting this one go.  I may pick it up used down the line just to complete the collection but there's no hurry.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This \\"movie\\", not documentary, is the biggest joke i have ever witnessed.  [...] The truth about moore is that he is not a democrat, he worked for nader in the 2000 election costing Gore the presidency.  Moore is a green party socialist with no intention of supporting John Kerry.  So what is the point of this movie?  Do u really think Moore is a fighter for the little guy?  He was born in a middle class family, private schooling all his life, now he is a millionaire.  Sorry, when i thing a crusader of the people i dont think of a fat ass millionaire who makes movies.  So what is the point of this movie?  Well, he knows the liberal media hates BUSH so why not cash in with an insulting fictional movie.  The people bought it, he got paid, and the liberal media gets another \\"brave figure head to look up to\\" as if he knows what he is talking about.  So the movie is out, Moore is richer and fatter, but where is Bush? STILL in the white house for 4 MOORE years loosers!!!  You liberals got conned, Moore dosent even agree with Kerry and he is rich, he just wants bush out of office.  So lesson is, ideals dont come with popcorn and a drink.  Since when is a fatt ass white millionaire an ally of the democrats? Maybe spongebob the movie will have all the answers for all u mooreons
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As I mentioned in a review for the cd release, which I also highly recommend, this is well done.  If you can hold down the lump in your throat and/or hold back the tear in your eye, all the power to you.  Clapton, Sir Paul, Ringo, Jeff Lynne, Petty, Harrison's son, and a bunch of other fine musicians playing for George and doing it in style.  This is a must have.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is an acquired taste.  At first, I didn't get the understated humor.  If you're looking for Jim Carrey fall on your face type humor, look elsewhere.  Napoleon and Pedro are two characters indeed and as the movie goes on you begin to understand their struggles and hopes and it all turns out very nicely in the end.  It is very funny but it an understated way with lots of visual humor.  His obnoxious cousin who wishes it was 1982 is so real..it's almost sad.  I can see where this film has a cult following.  It's the underdog against the preppie queen.  It's the underachiever coming out on top.  It's a good little story told in a new creative and imaginative way.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is about the amazing story of true love.  It will leave you breathless and motionless as the credits start to roll.  Noah and Ally found each other as teenagers, fell in love, and then was torn apart.  However, 10 years later the meet again and must confront their pasts, together.  It is easily the most romantic movie ever, and if you've seen it, I KNOW that you'll agree!!
B0000028WD|3.0|Not bad.  The definite highlight is \\"My Back Pages\\" where Harrison, Clapton, Dylan, Neil Young, McGuinn, and Petty all take a verse.  McGuinn sounds even better on \\"Mr Tamborine Man\\" and overall a great effort by all the artist covering some well known and not so well know Dylan songs.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Oh my god. This album is what created Nas and helped put him into the mainstream. I don't know if he could ever top this album. Every track is amazing. Nas flow is perfect on every beat. The production on this album literally blows my minds to bits its so perfect. THIS IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A HIP HOP CLASSIC, IF NOT THE BEST ALBUM EVER!!!! here is a review of each track. <br /> <br />1. The Genesis- Has nas lyrics from \\"Live at the BBQ\\", i think its called. Great introduction wtih a great beat. Was kinda hopin nas would spit a rhyme on the beat but didnt. 10/10. <br /> <br />2.N.Y. State Of Mind- another amazin song! Nas spits some intricate rhymes over a infectious beat. definitely a song you could zone out on. 10/10. <br /> <br />3.Life's a Bitch- this song features AZ and i wouldn't have any other way. Both Nas and AZ rhyme amazingly over a amazin beat. Nas has his father, Olu Dara, playin the trumpet at the end. Great Song! 10/10. <br /> <br />4.The World is Yours- a very inspirational track where nas spits some of the greatest rhymes ever. One of the best of the album although its hard to judge because the album is overflowing with pure perfection. 10/10. <br /> <br />5.Halftime-originally on the Zebrahead soundtrack, this song is awesome. as always nas kicks hot rhymes like theres no tomorrow. 10/10. <br /> <br />6.Memory lane- nas gets reminiscent on this track. it is great and nas rhymes are superb. a song to zone out on. 10/10. <br /> <br />7.One love- in this song nas is writting a letter to friend doin a bid. he tells of whats goin on on the outside and what lifes like back out on the street. great story telling by nas. 10/10. <br /> <br />8.One Time 4 your Mind- another piece of perfection from Nasty Nas. 10/10 <br /> <br />9.Represent- Nas represents QB on this track while the chorus chant's \\"represent y'all, REPRESENT!\\" I love this song. Amazing beat. Nas just rips every line with his rhymes. 10/10. <br /> <br />10.It Aint Hard to Tell- Another great nas song. 10/10. <br /> <br />Disc 2 <br />1. Lifes a Bitch remix- beat is great with nas and AZ spittin their original verses. 10/10. <br /> <br />2.The World Is Yours remix- a slowered pace beat with new rhymes on the second and third verses but still a great song. 9/10. <br /> <br />3.One love remix- A possibly better beat than the original? hard to say but it sure as hell is perfection. 10/10 <br /> <br />4.It ain't hard to tell remix- A great new beat with new verses from nas. 10/10. <br /> <br />5.On the real- This is a newer nas song with his newer flow mixed toghether with his classic illmatic flow. great song. 10/10. <br /> <br />6.Star Wars- A great song that is also new. 9/10.
B00003CXGG|3.0|I have been reading reviews of Jet Li's new movie, \\"Unleashed\\" based on its release in Paris (US is April 8).  Their version is a very rated \\"R\\" due to the dark violence.  Plus, it holds a very sad tone as Jet's character has the mentality of a child and is basically abused. Needless to say, it wasn't filmed in America and wasn't done via Joel Silvers.  And that is where this review comes in.   <br /> <br />This movie starts out of gate quite well, but eventually flutters.  There are redeeming parts here and there, but the missing places are filled with cliches.  I guess compared to \\"Cradle 2 the Grave\\" (also with Joel Silver) this one is not nearly as over-the-top.   <br /> <br />I've watched this with various family and friends.  The average reaction is medicore.  It has entertaining value and not a lot of substance.  The action scenes seemed spread out and even with sparce action, the characters fall short of feeling developed. <br /> <br />Maybe this will help; a quick ranking of Jet's American movies. <br />\\"Kiss of the Dragon\\" = Definately the best! (Dark tone) <br />\\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" = Jet basically fights and they are pretty good.  Hardly, if any at all, dialogue. <br />\\"Cradle 2 the Grave\\" = Cliched and way over the top.  Jet's character was pretty cool, but they should have used him more in the film. <br />\\"Romeo Must Die\\" = See above review <br />\\"The One\\" = A quick movie.  Don't expect much and you will be pleased. <br /> <br />A few overseas films: <br />\\"Hero\\" = Released, I believe in 2002 overseas and 2004 here.  This is an unbelievable movie.  Be warned, it is done in an artsy way with cinematic views, incredible scenary, a clever plot that takes its time to develop adding twists, and fantasy type fighting (I mean wire-fu...it works for this type of film). <br />\\"My Father is a Hero\\" = Great movie.  Not much action, but the story is nice.  Only the main villian is cheesy, but don't let that stop you from watching this. <br />\\"The Master\\" = Only if you are desparate to see another Jet Li film.  Otherwise, its really not worth your time. <br />\\"Once Upon A Time In China\\" = English dubbed is very lame, so avoid that version.  This movie is pretty good. <br />\\"Fist of Legend\\" = Remake of Bruce Lee's \\"Fist of Fury.\\"  This is more of hardcore fighting.  Jet plays a Chinese attending a Japanese school.  This causes problems, due to the tensions that the Japenese and Chinese have towards one another. <br />\\"Born To Defense\\" = English dubbed is comical.  This has some really great fight scenes though. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000DLV1|4.0|Most live albums pretty much lose the feel of the original studio albums -- sometimes they sound tinny and distant. No such sound here. \\"Live: Roseland NYC\\" has not only an orchestra, but the jazzy trip-hop of Portishead's two albums, and the beautiful voice of Beth Gibbons. No wonder it was so good.<br /><br />Portishead hit the big time with their sophomore album \\"Dummy,\\" an exquisite blend of smoky jazz and subtle trip-hop. Which, admittedly, sounds like the wrong kind of music to play live, but it works wonderfully here. Portishead includes an almost equal mix of songs from their two albums -- six from \\"Portishead,\\" five from \\"Dummy.\\"<br /><br />And surprisingly, the songs sound like simple redos of the mysterious, melancholy songs from Portishead's too-short career, not stage banter and stripped-down versions of lush songs. It's more than a little unusual to have a band's third album be a live one, but in this case it seems perfectly acceptable.<br /><br />Backed by an entire orchestra, horns and some wicked turntables, the band plays remarkable versions of their songs. \\"All Mine\\" is even more beautiful and haunting than in the album, and \\"Sour Times\\" is even more breathtaking than it was originally. Most of the others are faithful renditions, given a powerful new twist with the strings and horns -- only a couple feel less cohesive in a live setting.<br /><br />Frontwoman Beth Gibbons is known as having a lovely pop voice, and she is in excellent form here. A lot of singers are exposed in live performances as having less-than-stellar vocals, but Gibbons' performance demonstrates what a beautiful voice she has.<br /><br />\\"Live: Roseland NYC\\" is a demonstration of what a good live album should be, showcasing one of trip-hop's best bands. Definitely worth checking out, both as as an accompaniment to Portishead's studio albums, and as a good listen itself.
0385510438|4.0|\\"The Last Juror\\" is a bit of anomaly. There are many times when I have read non-fiction and found it hard to believe that the story is TRUE. While reading \\"The Last Juror\\" I had to keep reminding myself that it was in fact fiction. Such is the charm of Grisham's novel... it is warm, chraming and, at times, thrilling.<br /><br />The actual story is fairly predictable and at points, brutally slow.  Another slight annoyance is Grisham's portrayal of northern Mississippi. I feel that he has focused more on the stereotyopes  of the region and less on actual day-to-day life (I have lived in NE Mississippi for the last 5 years).<br /><br />I think Grisham found a nice balance of legal thrillers with his more human interest type stories. I would suggest \\"The Last Juror\\" to anyone who enjoyed \\"Midnight in The Garden of Good And Evil\\". I definitely suggest it as a nice quick read, especially if you happen to be at the beach!
B00005A46T|5.0|Yo, I just finished listening to IOWA for the first time and it really amazed me. While \\"Slipknot\\" and \\"Vol. 3\\" took quite awhile to grow on me, Iowa amazed me right away. It does lag a little bit in the middle with songs like \\"The Shape\\" but it's an overall great album. <br />(515) is a creepy intro, I like it. People=S*** and Disasterpiece are also good songs, they're quite a bit heavier than anything off the self-titled album. I really like Left Behind and Everything Ends, those are a couple of my favorites off the album. <br />Gently is a nice quiet song thrown in, I like it. Left Behind is a good choice for a single, not the best on the album but it's good. The Shape and I Am Hated are the lowest point on the album, neither song is really that good, just mediocre. Then there's the song everyone complains about: Skin Ticket. I really enjoyed this song, it was creepy and good to me. New Abortion and Metabolic didn't catch my attention too much, probably because immediately following them was the track... <br />Iowa. There's lots of complaints about this song too... why? So what if it's too long, it's really cool at the beginning and then the actual song kicks in and it's great too. Iowa starts to lag at about the 10 minute mark but it's a memorable song and a great way to close the album. <br /> <br />So, this album should be in your collection if you like Slipknot or metal. It's less rap-oriented than the self-titled and it's a little more exciting than Vol. 3.

B000063DFQ|5.0|When i first listened to this cd i was amazed with the excellent guitar work done by Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. This was the fist cd i got from maiden and i have to say that it is there very best. It is heavy, catchy, and anyone will like it. You have to listen to it a few times before you really learn to love the album..but it was amazing, see for yourself: BUY IT! <br />  <br />1. Where eagles Dare: 9/10    <br />It was a good song, but it wasnt quite perfect. <br /> <br />2. Revelations: 10/10  <br />By far my favorite on the cd. When i first heard it, i was amazed. The opening 20 seconds are my favorite part of the song with the awesome guitar riff.  <br /> <br />3. Flight of Icarus: 10/10  <br />My second favorite song on the cd. I didnt like it as much as revelations because it didnt have the same excellent guitar solos, riffs, and speed that revelations had.  <br /> <br />4. Die With your Boots on: 8/10 <br />It was a good song, but lacked the same style as the rest of the cd.  <br /> <br />5. The trooper: 10/10 <br />A great track on this album, some would say the best just because of the awesome guitar/bass riffs in the opening and in the chorus! <br /> <br />6. Still Life: 7/10 <br />Still a good song, but i do insist that it is the worst song on the cd. It just doesnt have the same original sound that the rest of the cd has.  <br /> <br />7. Quest For Fire: 8/10 <br />Good, but if drifts from their sound a bit.  <br /> <br />8. Sun and Steel: 9/10 <br />A really good song, but i couldnt say it was perfect because it didnt progress as much as some of the other music work on the amazing album.  <br /> <br />9. To tame a land: 8/10 <br />The longest song on the cd. A really cool opening guitar piece, it took a lot of work, but i didnt like it that much. It was different, so thats why its still up to the bands standards!
B000001EAQ|5.0|When Pop was released I eagerly listened to it and was immediately struck by how dense it was. There were so many interesting things going on in each song that it took several listens to absorb it. It's one of the few records that when you listen to it a month later it is familiar but you still hear things that you didn't hear previously.  <br /> <br />Pop is a collection of music that you will not tire of. With each listening there is another gem of sound or lyric you can linger on. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include 'Staring At The Sun', 'Mofo', 'Discotheque', 'Please', 'Gone', 'Last Night On Earth' and 'If God Will Send His Angels'. <br /> <br />Every song is vital as this album sways you along on a 60 minute emotional journey that has you asking for more. This album is MUST add to anyone's C.D. collection. Pop is not just music album, it's an experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002M3V0C|5.0|I listened to the album samples before I bought this CD.  I was surprised at how many of the songs I knew already, I just never knew who sang them.  I listen to this CD all the time, it puts me in a good mood.  I'm looking forward to see what they come out with next.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|I first heard about this movie last week, through the grapevine that is Jr. High.  Everyone was raving about it, saying how funny and great it was.  I just had to watch it too.   <br />So I rented the dvd. I watched the first half hour or so, waiting for the funny, a plot, anything to sustain me through the movie.  Nothing.  It's just the beginning, I thought.  It'll be great by the end, just like everyone else said.   <br />So I waited. And waited. And waited. I waited until, finally, it was the end of the movie.   <br />I sat in amazement, wondering how anyone could like this movie.  The 'laugh lines' that everyone raved about weren't funny.  NO plot was ever really developed, and the movie never really finished. <br /> <br />All in all, I would definitely say that this is the WORST movie I have ever seen, and that includes Glitter and the Spice Girls movie.  I would not give this movie any stars if I was not required to.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|Bill Murray was his usual funny self in this movie. However, moments of humor don't add up to a good movie. Just what the heck was the point, or dare I ever venture to say PLOT of this film? I've watched this film thrice and I haven't deciphered the plot.......ok ok fine..it goes something like this: disillusioned middle-aged married celebrity meets disillusioned newly-wed in totally alien country and culture and adventures are had therein.....but so? So what? The characters just sort of flounder in a wierd sort of ambiguity for nearly the entire film. The only hint of a REAL character development is towards the end when Murray's character says something along the lines of \\"hang in there\\" and \\"you still have time\\" referring to Johanssen's character's life and marriage. Well, gee.....that's a real no-brainer, and it took the entire length of the film to get to it. <br /> <br />Another fine example of a film in which flash (the imagery, soundtrack, what-have you) is placed ahead of substance and the \\"flash\\" elements are made to appear substantial.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|I was actually looking forward to this film when it was released in the theaters.  I originally thought that the premise was original and creative.  Here, on my television, I was seeing images that I normally didn't associate with Hollywood.  Yea, it was big budget, yea it had these larger stars headlining the film (even a dead one), but I thought that perhaps it was one of those under-the-radar hits.  The critics hated it and it even fueled my desire to see it further.  There had to be something redeemable about this film.  Well, I finally had a chance to see it and I, sadly, will have to fence with the critics on this one.  This was an irritating, uncontrollable mess of a film that attempted to be original in every way possible, but instead found itself just being nothing more than a lump of cheap Hollywood mess complete with jumbled characters, a sloppy story, and finally even some overly dull CGI.  This was nothing that the advertisements promoted it would be.<br /><br />The CGI was the immediate draw for me into this film.  I was interested in seeing how director Kerry Conran would handle this feature with only the use of the blue/green screen.  With Lucas completely blowing down the door with modern technology, and the world of Hollywood at your fingertips, I thought that Conran would blow me out of the water.  Sadly, I found myself treading water for a couple of hours to follow.  The CGI seemed messy and fuzzy, blurred around the edges, I found myself squinting at the television and continually wondering what the glow was around each of our characters.  The darkened moments were too light, and the lighted moments were too dark.  It was as if Conran presented to us the rough draft of his project, instead of giving us a final, crisper draft.  I know that it was to represent an older generation and pay homage to that era that birthed the sci-fi genre, but in all honesty this was the black sheep of that generation and genre.  The green/blue screen was my biggest issue with this film.  It hurt my eyes to look at and took my appreciation away for any possibility of creativity and uniqueness.  It was sloppy, for lack of a better word, and I think Conran knew that from the beginning.<br /><br />I think that he knew that it wasn't going to be this crisp feature because he boasted some larger named stars to throttle this film even more.  If he would have focused, yet even promoted, this film on the green/blue screen uniqueness alone, perhaps he would have done a bit better with the critics and box office, but instead we had to be guided through this mess by actors that just couldn't seem to carry their own simple characters.  This was my second major issue for me with this film.  Here you have Jude Law, Oscar-winning Gwyneth Paltrow, and even Oscar-winning Angelina Jolie headlining your film and yet they cannot seem to grasp the characters that they have to portray.  These were simpleton characters that really didn't need to much to fuel them, just some good old fashioned acting, but sadly our friends who are being paid far more than me, just couldn't handle this task.  This shoddy acting caused the chemistry between Law and Paltrow to be as dead as a doornail.  I literally never felt as if these two cared in any way about each other.  It was just another Hollywood pairing that backfired horribly in everyone's faces.  I couldn't even tell if they liked each other as friends it was that poor.  Is it bad when you think that the only actor who seemed to carry their part decently well was Sir Lawrence Olivier?  I think it is bad when a dead actor upstages the best of Hollywood.  There is definitely something wrong with this picture.  This horrible, messy acting with apparent lack of chemistry drew my attention away from the green/blue screen long enough to completely sour my stomach again.  Perhaps the story will lend a better hand ...<br /><br />Wrong again friends.  The story was a classic \\"Who cares\\" moment where you witness yourcharacters going through the motions, building the plot to bring us to a conclusion, but you find yourself really just saying \\"Who cares\\" throughout all of it.  The already poor use of actors and green/blue screen pushed too much pressure onto the story, which, like an employee on his first day of work, just crumbled under the stress.  There was honestly nothing valuable to the entire story that I can put in this review.  From the over-the-top introduction to the world and Sky Captain to the jumbled mess that was Angelina Jolie, to the final moments where I am sure PETA was up in arms. Even the ending line just forced that final breath of air out of you and made you more excited about returning this film.  It was shameful.<br /><br />Overall, nothing can be pulled and claimed as redeemable for this film.  I will say that the thought was creative, but sadly it was the creation process that ultimately failed this film.  From poor green/blue screen translation to stubble acting with a shoddy story, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is everything the critics claimed and more.  I am not normally one that will take the critics sides, but this film just didn't work anywhere.  I do not suggest it to anyone, and in fact if you see a friend with it in their hands, go ahead and burn their hands off.  You would be doing them a favor and hopefully the infection will not spread.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****your characters going through the motions, building the plot to bring us to a conclusion, but you find yourself really just saying \\"Who cares\\" throughout all of it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can only echo what has already been said. This is a fantastic series that was killed off early by short-sighted TV execs. After the critical plaudits and huge popularity of Buffy The Vampire Slayer I just don't understand why Joss Whedon wasn't trusted to ultimately deliver the goods. When will the \\"powers that be\\" quit sticking their noses in? We can only hope the film is a success and the show is picked up again. <br /> <br />Any sci-fi fan should own this series, as well as any fan of brilliantly written and well acted drama, regardless of the genre. Superb.
B000286RNY|5.0|What a wonderful sports film. STOP, read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.<br /><br />This was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously ... AND ... it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them ... you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.<br /><br />Siu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau.  It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.<br /><br />Overall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film ... the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****ct that this was a revenge film.

B000669GAI|5.0|Don't get me wrong.  I only gave this album 5 stars because I am so biased towards this band that I'm not sure if I could ever give them anything less.  However, I don't really see any reason why they had to release this album.  Epic was obviously trying to cash in one last time before the band left them for good. <br />If you are already a fan of Pearl Jam, then this album is pointless because not only do you know that there is so much brilliant material that was left off of these two discs, but you also already own all of this stuff. <br />If you are not a fan of Pearl Jam yet then it means you probably never will be or you are five years old and have never listened to a CD in your life.  Therefore, except for the fact that this may help future generations get a little acquainted with one of the greatest rock bands of our time, I still cringe at the idea of my favorite band being the subjected to a poorly-selected \\"Greatest Hits\\" album.  Please, don't hold this against them.  Their music is much bigger than this. <br />

0156421178|5.0|This book deserves five stars because it is honest -- and few contemporary writings about the Spanish Civil War are. (Ernest Hemingway's novel, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is another.) The Spanish Civil War was an intensely ideological conflict between Right and Left and adherents of both sides told outrageous lies in pursuit of victory. Orwell was of the Left but he still saw the war clearly and wrote about what he saw without adornment.  <br /> <br />In \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" Orwell tells the story of his seven months as a volunteer soldier with the Loyalists fighting against the Fascists in 1936-1937. The first half of the book is about his life as a common soldier on the front lines near Barcelona. It is unvarnished and unheroic and often amusing. In the second half of the book he describes the chaotic events in Barcelona when the Loyalist factions, especially the Anarchists and Communists, fought pitched battles against each either and pretty much ignored their common enemy, the Fascists of General Franco. Orwell himself ended up fleeing Spain to avoid being arrested by the people he had come to Spain to help.  <br /> <br />Orwell makes clear that his sympathies are with the Anarchists who favor the creation of an equalitarian worker's government. He was appalled by the evil and incompetence he saw and his experience in Spain probably contributed greatly to his later cautionary novels \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm.\\"  If you want to learn about the Spanish Civil War, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is the first book to read.  You will get a high standard of truth that you can use to judge other works.   <br /> <br />Smallchief
B00000JGHL|3.0|One can't deny that Al Pacino is an electrifying actor and he can make almost any movie better than it should have been.  In CITY HALL, he suffers from the curse of too many writers spoiling the broth.  The script is disjointed, at times contradictory, and the ending is a letdown in the lack of its intensity.  Pacino is matched by a fine young actor, John Cusack, who plays the gungho idol worshipping deputy mayor.  Bridget Fonda is lovely to look at, but her role is so underdeveloped, she could have been a male character and we wouldn't have noticed the difference.  Danny Aiello is brilliant in his usual \\"mafia\\" role, but his talent enables him to instill a small sense of humaneness in his doomed role.  Notice the great opera singer Roberta Peters in the small role of his wife.  Anthony Franciosa, rarely seen in movies these days, plays the crime boss with a reserved intensity that makes him even more vitriolic.  David Paymer is good, but his role isn't fleshed out enough to know his character.  Martin Landau's judge is also almost a cameo, but Landau delivers.  Much mention is made of the late great Jerry Goldsmith's score, which is so eclectic, it doesn't have much impact.  The music at the end credits almost sounds like a western or war movie accompaniment.<br /><br />CITY HALL is interesting, but ultimately its tale of political corruption is so derivative and predictable, it doesn't elevate the movie to the potential greatness it could have achieved.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Director Alfonso Cuaron, (\\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" and \\"A Little Princess\\"), has successfully introduced pizzazz and a dark edginess to this Harry Potter film. The movie's ambiance is totally different under Cuaron's guidance - grittier, grimmer, and more visually stunning, with a subdued color scheme. \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" based on J. K. Rowling's third book, is my favorite film to date. With a screenplay from Steven Kloves, and Cuaron's creativity, this is the darkest, best written, most entertaining and original of all three movies.<br /><br />Thirteen year-old Harry, (Daniel Radcliffe), has moved into adolescence, along with his friends Ron Weasley, (Rupert Grint - whose voice is now quite wobbly), and Hermione Granger, (Emma Watson, who has become a delightful young woman). Moodiness, raging hormones, teen angst, voice change, developing bodies, romantic feelings and unstable emotions are the usual symptoms. Harry is finally expressing his anger at being left in the care of his cold, unloving, wicked aunt and uncle. He even talks back to the Dursley's, (with good reason!). In the opening sequence Harry risks expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, by practicing magic in the Muggle world, when he turns his despicable Aunt Marge into a floating human dirigible.<br /><br />The start of Harry's third year at Hogwarts coincides with the murderous Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban Prison. Gary Oldman is outstandingly creepy as the escapee. Black, a wizard and an alumni of Hogwarts, is looking for young Potter. Harry has been told that the mass murderer betrayed his parents and is likely to add their son to his extensive list of victims. He was once the Potter couple's best friend, which made his betrayal all the more terrible. Dementors, terrifying robed wraiths that suck the life and the soul out of their targets, are guarding the school against the escaped convict's entrance. It makes me wonder who is guarding the students against the Dementors, much scarier creatures than Black!! Oddly, Harry experiences blackouts when in the presence of the Dementors. And shapeshifters, lycanthrope's, patrol the school grounds. Also, be on the look-out for a knock-out Quidditch game.<br /><br />While the riveting plot is about Sirius Black's hunt for Harry, the film's underlying themes are growth, maturity, loyalty and friendship. Harry has always been curious about his parents, dreamed of them, fantasized about them, longed for them at times - especially when in the care his Muggle relatives. Now he is left to cope with his own survival and the enormity of his loss. The tragic murder of his mother and father has become more vivid, more concrete, as he has become more emotionally mature. His parents as individuals, who they were and how they lived, take on new importance. They have become real people to Harry, instead of an idealized couple in a photograph. He is determined to discover the truth about whose betrayal led to their deaths. Professor Lupin, a new faculty member, in quiet, personal conversations with Harry, reveals more of the Potter's history and their personalities. Lupin was a close friend and sees, in Harry, a strong resemblance to both his parents. This aspect of the movie is very poignant.<br /><br />The presence of magic and the fantastical permeate the film - making it all the more enchanting. Dining room tables are cleared through wizardry. Talking shrunken heads hang from the bus driver's dashboard. Portraits on the Hogwarts' stairway come to life. The extraordinary Marauder's Map, used to determine everyone's whereabouts, as well as geographic location, comes into Harry's possession. Dumbledore uses magic as a gesture, nonchalantly extinguishing a candle and then re-igniting it with a wave of his hand. There's even a shrieking shack, and the Knight bus, a bizarre blue double-decker that literally squeezes its way through traffic. A strange combination of bird and steed, called a hippogriff, is introduced, and flying with him beats traveling by broomstick any day!<br /><br />The school faculty has returned, as has the class bully Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Headmaster Dumbledore, (Michael Gambon takes over for the late Richard Harris), presides over the group of academics who include: Professor Snape, (Alan Rickman), who has the art of sneering down pat; Deputy Headmistress and Professor of Transfiguration Minerva McGonagall, (Dame Maggie Smith), has the ability to turn into a cat; and beloved forester Hagrid, (Robbie Coltrane), who has been promoted to professor, proudly teaches Care of Magical Creatures. Professor Lupin, (David Thewlis) is new and has taken over teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. Emma Thompson is divinely ditzy as Sybil Trelawney, who teaches Divinations - reading of crystal balls and tea leaves.<br /><br />While it is extremely difficult to condense a 435 page book into a 136 minute film, most will find this adaptation faithful to Ms. Rowlings outstanding novel - except for a few Hogwarts diehards who don't understand compromise. I think the book's spirit is wonderfully captured here. \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is pure delight. ENJOY!<br /><br />JANAd, called a hippogriff, is introduced, and flying with him beats traveling by broomstick any day!  <br />  <br />The school faculty has returned, as has the class bully Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).

0156027321|5.0|I&#8217;m not typically one of those \\"book-reader\\" type people, but once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down until I was done.  It&#8217;s a very engaging, well-written adventure/travel-log story.  I have recommended it to several of my friends and I recommend it to you.
B0002N4ZEW|1.0|I have almost all of Porcupine Tree's CDs and have seen them live, but this is awful.  It is just a random collection of noise and is probably the worst CD out of over 1000 progressive CDs I own.  Save your money -- don't buy it!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Where did this come from? Man... I've been deprived since the release of this album. I just got it a couple weeks ago, and I feel like I am in high school again, listening to bands that actually know how to convey EMOTION (unlike 99% of modern music today). Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, Live... Muse could've been popular right alongside them. I'm not saying they sound like them, they are just along the same vein (90's alternative). I didn't think people made music like this anymore!!! Even the slow songs have emotional payoffs at the choruses and bridges (an artform I thought was lost along with the feeling associated with 90's alternative). Do they sound a bit like early Radiohead? Sure... are they better than early Radiohead? (Don't shoot me) YES! I never liked Radiohead much... Muse has all of the emotion that Radiohead was missing (for me anyway). And they aren't a blatant rip-off. I think the main reason people are saying that is Matthew's voice. Well, get over it, because this album kicks ass.
B000268QB2|5.0|You're reading this review so you either heard Keane and liked them, or you heard the hype and wanted to see how they stack up to the hype. Unfortunately they do stack up. The music is catchy British near Emopop and it's better done than anything America is putting out right now. The singer has an amazing voice, the piano player is better than bad (He's not good enough to clean Ben Folds piano, and Ben Folds isn't good enough to tune Elton John's piano, but enough about that). The drumming is average too, it's really the production and song value that gets you. Sweeping melodies and heartfelt lyrics really are par for the course on \\"Hopes and Fears\\". If you like Coldplay, you'll like Keane. They are very similar. The sound, even though it's coming from a two-piece band manages to sound much more than minimalist (Thank you slick production values).  <br /> <br />In the end, \\"Hopes and Fears\\" captures teenage angst, as wrung through the corporate music machine. It's classic 80s pop reborn as British pop. Tears for Fears begat this album. I promise.  <br /> <br />
B000003TSP|5.0|Portishead is classic musique-noir album that is beyond description.  Its hauntingly fractured beats with \\"loungey\\" inspiration and Gibbon's emotive vocals which range from despair to mocking to exhilaration form into one of the most unique sounds.  Though arguably theatrical at times, this is an album that has and will continue to amaze.  I was a casual listener to \\"Dummy\\", Portishead's first, but upon buying this album in 1998 I was in rapture:  this music is moving. Sounding like a 1940's nightclub or 1960's lounge at times and then quickly moving to sounds that sound like a SoHo art club and then switching to a mood like that 4 AM telephone call with some girl who is just too close to the edge,  the sheer range and feel of this album is fantastic. <br /> <br />One thing that is terrific about this album is that it can be played the whole way through making it a great soundtrack to a cool party or a long drive to nowhere.  Its jazzy smooth yet jarring sound is good morning noon and night.  If you don't own this album yet you are years late but don't worry, its not dated and it will provide great enjoyment for years to come. <br /> <br />-- Ted Murena
B0002V7ODI|5.0|*HELLBOY: The Director's Cut*<br /><br />What does it take to be a man? That is a very good question. Some take their manhood for granted, while others risk their lives and become a man by accident. This story is much deeper than it appears. I was truly touched, towards the end of the movie, when Hellboy makes his choices between right and wrong.<br /><br />There's not much, if any, foul language. For todays standards it was very tame. Nor is it really all that scary. But there are some neat and bizarre monsters, great special effects and lots of action.<br /><br />Dads...I highly recommend this movie. Sit down with your 13 year old or older son and enjoy this fantastic film. Then ask him what he thinks it takes to be a man. I bet he'll want to be a \\"GOOD\\" and \\"HONORABLE\\" person. Don't let the title fool you, there is something to be learned from a movie like this. Not to mention it's just stinking neat to watch. Ron Pearlman is fantastic. He really makes Hellboy a respectable SUPERHERO with a great sense of honor and a great sense of humor.<br /><br />This movie is deeper than it appears. 2 THUMBS UP...WAAAY UP!!!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. The comedy, drama and romance elements are expertly balanced to create a unique blend, and the visually lush sets and costumes make the movie an unforgettable experience. <br /> <br />The basic plot is the old story of love spiced with some growing up independence issues, but the character development, fantastic dance scenes, quirky humour, gaudy outfits and screwball characters give this movie its very own timeless atmosphere. <br /> <br />Don't miss this gem from the creator of Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge - you'll easily recognise his style, but this movie is very much its own.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Once again Kaufman treats us to a truly imanginative and unique script. Besides being a touching love story, the film accurately explores the fragmented and twisted nature of the human mind through vivid imagary and hypnotic dreamlike atmospheres. However, it did seem somewhat padded. The cat and mouse game got slightly tedious toward the end. Perhaps this screenplay was adapted from a short story, because it certainly feels like it.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the ultimate grunge. If you like any modern day alternative band, listen to this. It is modern day rock's father. Sure, Smells Like Teen Spirit is way overplayed, but the album goes way beyond that. Listen to some of the other good songs, such as Come As You Are, Polly, and Something In The Way. And for all of those who criticize Cobain's singing voice, it is a love or hate thing. Most people love it, including me. But, there are the unfortunate few who cannot appreciate good singing when they hear it, and most of them themselves cannot sing. As for Nirvana's simple riffs, the simplicity is what makes it beautiful. Kurt Cobain wasn't trying to be Jimi Hendrix. He introduced rock to a new, and in some ways better form of rock, which started out as grunge, but then became generalized into Alternative Rock. If you like this, I encourage you to buy In Utero.

B0002OERI0|4.0|...as good as it is, it's a little disheartening to see Green Day become such blatant media whores. When Entertainment magazine buoyantly exclaims \\"Green Day Saves Rock!\\", something is definitely wrong. When \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" starts scaling the pop charts and being played into the ground on pop radio stations, you know something is wrong. When Billie Joe starts whining about how he wants a Grammy...well, you get the idea. At times, it seems as if the media circus that's been surrounding Green Day for months is the result of a carefully calculated and extraordinarily well-carried out plot to get the band back in the spotlight and sell millions of records. I'd like to believe that Green Day aren't as conniving and greedy as that, but to see a band change so drastically like this is pretty shocking. What happened to not caring about your street cred or record sales? What happened to the wild, raucous songs like Platypus? Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to the band changing. But it's nothing short of nauseating to see the band try to become not only the darling of the critics, but also political spokesmen. Sadly, Green Day seem to be going the way of Guns N' Roses, a band whose frontman's ego and pretensions drove them into the ground. With statements like \\"We wanted to make a work of art\\", Billie Joe is sounding a lot like Axl right about now. If you really think the band doesn't care about their popularity or record sales, take a look at the songs they chose for singles off the record: American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Holiday, and Wake Me Up When September Ends. To me, all of these are easily digestible, radio-friendly pop-rock songs (BoBD is particularly heinous - as far as pretentious, overblown power ballads go, they don't come much worse than this). And so far, the title track and BoBD have been massive hits and propelled the record into the top ten. It's kind of ironic - Armstrong whines about governemt lies and corruption, but he's a pretty big hypocrite himself. It seems his grandiose art-rock ambitions stopped short when deciding what songs to release as singles. If he was really interested in showing musical growth and taking chances, why not release something different? How about one of those 9-minute songs we hear so much about? Everyone says American Idiot is such a fresh and creative work. And yet its mastermind chose the most mundane, cliched songs for singles. Bad-decision making? I doubt it. For all his bloated pretensions and laughable political statement, it seems like Armstrong is just in it for the money like everyone else. In fact, this whole aura the band was trying to surround themselves with - this notion of \\"musically maturing\\" and \\"growing up\\" and creating a \\"rock opera\\" - I doubt their motives were purely artistic. Seems to me like what they really wanted to do was win over the critics. Once that happened, they would get media attention, MTV would be knocking at their door, mainstream trash like Entertainment and Kiss 108 (Boston radio station) would start extolling them, and fame and fortune - which they haven't really had since Dookie - would be theirs once more. And it looks like it's worked pretty well. Do you really think Green Day is \\"shocked\\" by all this success? I don't think so.    I realize many people don't share these views, and this review will likely be targeted by people who think Green Day are infallible of such things. And that's just fine. But facts are facts, and I doubt I'm the only one who's been disgusted by the relentless overplaying of that \\"Boulevard\\" piece of crap or how every critic in the land seems to have become Green Day's personal rumpswab.    ...    That said, it's a pretty good album. There are some duds, but overall I'd give it a solid B/B+. The band could have picked much better songs for singles, but we've already been over that, haven't we....    Steve Sweeney
0802130208|1.0|The first chapter of this novel bored me to tears.  But, since it is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, I pressed on.  I thought it would get better. <br /> <br />It didn't. <br /> <br />Most of the characters in this book are not even relatively believable.  They are so absurd and unordinary that you can't for one second take any of them seriously.  Which, I guess, was supposed to make the book humorous.  In my opinion, it was just ridiculous. <br /> <br />The worst part of the book was the lack of plot.  The story seems to be going nowhere until you get a hundred pages into the book--even then, the plot is questionable.  It is really very, very boring. <br /> <br />I really don't see how this book won a Pulitzer Prize.

B00005JNJ7|5.0|A lot of reviewers have complained that the puppet work in this film was so obvious that it distracted the reviewers from the plot.  Frankly, I liked the way the director made sure the audience understood these weren't animations or CGI's. The director was working in a medium that hearkens back to the obviousness, simplicity, and, yes, childishness, of Punch & Judy, Howdy Doody, and Kukla, Fran, and Ollie.<br /><br />The plot wasn't any dumber that an 007 James Bond flic and the lashing the writers gave the Left, the Right, and  International Terrorism was in perfect harmony with young, bright, clever minds who see hypocrisy and danger in every political posture. Honestly, I found Team America's message easier to accept than Michael Moore's recent stuff.<br /><br />I really liked this film and I thought the production values--  expensive sets, great musical numbers, clever work with marionettes' clothes, facial expressions, and \\"intimate\\" connections-- showed the producers weren't  working on the cheap. And, I laughed a lot. A whole lot.
B000002VSN|5.0|I think this is my favorite soundtrack of any movie and I own lots of soundtracks!  I love each and every song on this CD.  I first got this CD back in 1996 when it was on cassette and listened to my cassette until it barely played.  I think this CD is a work of art that Whitney can never touch this is absolutely her best work ever!  If you like Whitney or gospel or even both you will love this CD!
B0002F6AH0|4.0|As a student of WWII, and a veteran of Vietnam (USN), I was a bit disappointed in this series.  I had originally seen bits and pieces of the series when it aired on PBS in the early 80's and had the expectation that the entire series would be the definative view of WWII (understandedly with a British perspective).  This series is much more slanted than I expected. <br /> <br />For instance, the series concerns itself almost entirely with the European theater and European issues (such as the Jewish genocide).  The Pacific theater is almost completly missing.  The Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor is barely mentioned and turning points in the Pacific, such as Midway, are mentioned only in passing.  Indeed, there are a number of events in the Pacific theater which would have been of interest to European viewers (the fall of Singapore, Hong Kong, the Phillipines, sinking of the Repulse and Prince of Wales) which are almost completely ignored even though there is a rather lengthly piece about the atomic bomb attacks upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the war in Burma.  The American island-hopping strategy is not explored in detail and no explanation for the very costly invasion of Okinawa is given.  (Since the American air forces were already able to bomb Japan from other islands why was it necessary to invade Okinawa killing over 100,000 civilians and 12,000 American soldiers in the process?) <br /> <br />Not taking anything away from the makers of this series, for it was indeed a formibable undertaking, it is incomplete if the purpose was a historical depiction of the war around the world.  As it pertains to the European theater it seems much more complete although there are several areas which are virtually ignored (Greece, the Balkans etc.).   <br /> <br />I am glad I bought and viewed it but have to admit it didn't add substantial knowledge to what I already knew.  Luckily, I have a son who is deeply interested in Germany's role in the war and this will be a good starting point for his continuing studies.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is for all ages!  I am in my twenties and I loved it the first time I saw it and watch it all the time still.  It is also great for kids as it keeps their interest.   <br /> <br />Marlin is very overprotective of  Nemo who is his only baby survivor after his wife and other eggs were eaten by a shark.  Nemo hates that his father is so protective so on his first day of school Nemo is testing the waters and his father sees that he is swimming where he is not allowed.  To spite his father Nemo keeps swimming and gets caught by a Scuba Diver.  And taken to a dentist office where he meets other fish who were also caught. It also introduces us to a mean little girl who is rough with fish and kills her's.  The dentist is giving Nemo to her (his niece) because it is her birthday.  The other fish try and free Nemo before he heads to the toilet. And Marlin meets up with Dory and they go on an adventure to find Nemo.  This movie is full of laughs and bright beautiful colors.  It is also great for adults as you will get jokes the kids don't.  I think Nemo is great because your whole family can watch it! <br />
0345409671|2.0|I love the character of Lestat. I love the chronicles. I do not love this book. I feel like I deserve an award for getting through the entire middle part. ACK! And please, having him gorge on menstrual blood...what was the point? You destroyed Lestat for what reason?  <br /> <br />This book just does not match any of the chronicles so far. The character development of the other novels just got blown to bits with this \\"novel\\". The story, ugh. I still just don't get the point because I was waiting for it to have something to do with the other Chronicles...to keep the characters true and this book seems to be a completely new thing borrowing character's names.  <br /> <br />If you like having your characters in a series tossed out for something else and a story that is just a very long winded diatribe on concepts of good/evil and belief systems, then this book is for you. For me, it put the brakes on my fascination with this series. I am almost afraid to try and read the next book in this series. <br /> <br />I have to apologize for the review...I just cannot give this the right words to tell you how disappointed I am in the way it made me feel after completing it. <br />
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This Movie is Awesome,I would recommend this movie if you like darker films like Mulholland Drive,Memento,and Fight Club.I also happen to know there releasing a director's cut of this film on 2/15/05 might be something you'd want to check out after watching this film.
B00005A46T|1.0|IhateMTV is right, Slipknot is an insult to real Metal and to the music in general. Don't get offended at my review. Plus, the irony is, I didn't buy this album. Instead, I downloaded some of their songs from this album and hated them.    SIDE NOTE:    T. Bazzano, YOU are the one who is the complete clown and moron. You say that Korn is excellent, its fans have ages ranging from below 13 years old to 40, and that Mallcore doesn't exist? Please. To back up the words I said, Mallcore is a substitute word for Nu Metal. And again, Nu Metal is NOT Metal. It is a genre mislabeled by the media to brainwash people to think it is Metal. However, the truth of the matter is, it really isn't. It is Alt. Rock with VERY SLIGHT METAL influences added with an X-Factor. Just because a certain genre has slight Metal influences doesn't mean that it becomes Metal already.    Believe me, I am a music expert. I was once a fan of Nu Metal, or Mallcore, music and liked such crappy bands like Korn, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, and Papa Roach. These are the kind of bands that fit very well into the Mallcore (Nu Metal) category. Now I really knocked some sense into myself and started listening to REAL Metal bands such as Megadeth, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and some other great Metal bands. After listening to them, I found out when the bands I once used to like, the Nu Metal bands, were nothing but [...] compared to REAL Metal bands because the Nu Metal bands usually address topics such as angst, depression, hatred of society, and this annoying attitude to think you are \\"cooler\\" than everybody else.    You people can call me an elitist or anything derogatory all you want. But comparing Nu Metal bands to REAL Metal bands such as old Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Pantera, Death, Nile, Cryptopsy, Suffocation, Malevolent Creation, and Kreator will be pointless already because the latter, the REAL Metal bands, are always going to win. I hope that one day you Nu Metal fans are going tobe mortified for listening to those kind of bands (the likes of Korn, Slipknot, etc.).    I can't for the life of me to understand why people so truly retarded would listen to Nu Metal bands and conform to MTV and the [...] media.

0679311726|5.0|In this book Dallaire remembers an official from a Western nation remarking that 85,000 Rwandans would have to die to justify the death of one soldier from his country.<br />Dallaire conveys the crushing sense of responsibility he continues to feel for failing to protect the 800,000 who died in Rwanda, but that weight flows through him to the reader as each of us bears blame in the failure of humanity he describes. This book forces a wrenching change of world view.<br />Dallaires writing is natural and simple. Though some scenes are disturbing, he doesnt rely on gore to exact an emotional response. Its important to read this book.

Why isn't the most beautiful thing I heard that day on the festival dvd?   I believe it's because part 2 is coming...there was plenty of music for a part 2 and probably a part 3 as well. <br />SO...definitely pick this DVD up, but wait patiently for the release of part 2 with me...
B000000WCA|2.0|Back in 1997...I was sitting backstage of SNL, watching the Spice Girls rehearse their two numbers during an early Saturday. We had monitors all over the place at NBC..no matter where you were on the floor..they had live feed of the skit rehearsals throughout the day..I had never heard of Spice Girls..but as I was watching them sing..I thought..\\"These guys are awful, they won't last two years\\"..sure enough they died out shortly after..Why did I think this and predict this?...because I have an ear and a historical knowledge of the past 40 years of music..and I need to tell \\"ya all\\" \\"THEY DON\\"T HAVE ANY INSTRUMENTS\\"..They were as bad as any \\"boy band\\" conceived..Next time you tasteless wenches want to hear real quality \\"production\\" music..listen to groups or performers like: CHIC, ARETHA FRANKLIN, TINA TURNER, BILLY JOEL, CHICAGO, DAVID BOWIE, DONNA SUMMERS, EARTH WIND AND FIRE, EL COCO, FLEETWOOD MAC, LED ZEPPELIN, THE WHO, THE BEATLES, GORDON LIGHTFOOT, KOOL & THE GANG, DURAN DURAN, LOU RAWLS, ROBERTA FLACK, SPINNERS, STEELY DAN, SUPERTRAMP, VAN MORRISON, WINGS, and that was all in the 1970's..I won't even touch the 60's..because that music has way too much \\"creative, cultural and power of lyrics\\" It's so friggin revolutionary..it's for you to discover..Shall we touch on the 80's a bit? <br />AHA, ADAM ANT, ALAN PARSONS PROJECT, BERLIN,  BILLY OCEAN, BLONDIE, CULTURE CLUB, EURYTHMICS, GAP BAND, GEORGE MICHAEL, HALL & OATES, HERBIE HANCOCK, HEART, HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS, LIONEL RICHIE, MEN AT WORK, MISSING PERSONS, NEW ORDER, NAKED EYES, NEWCLEUS, PAT BENATOR, PHIL COLLINS, POLICE, PINK FLOYD, PRINCE & THE REVOLUTIOIN, QUEEN, ROBERT PLANT, ROXY MUSIC, SHEENA EASTON, SIMPLE MINDS, SPANDAU BALLET, STEVE MILLER BAND, STEVE WINWOOD, STEVIE NICKS, STYX, TEARS 4 FEARS,THOMPSON TWINS, TOM PETTY, TONE LOC, VAN HALEN, ZZ TOP, YES...do I need to go on. <br /> <br />I highly recommend that anyone out there that thinks the Spice Girls have any talent other than being a formed \\"commercial\\" group for the sole purpose of being \\"eye-candy\\" has any credibility..you need to grow up a bit and open the ears to higher quality production values. <br /> <br />People used to go out TO DANCE..now they just stand around trying to look good while looking at their cell phones wondering who is trying to call them..very sad what has happened to the youth..The 60's and 70's they were more consciously active...and wouldn't tolerate \\"cr@p\\" music.. but have \\"bought into\\" what the corporation dish out...we didn't accept \\"cr@p\\" like this back in the day and neither should you.
0316548189|4.0|Review by Rev. George van Popta    Today I finished reading Long Walk to Freedom, the very impressive autobiographical account of the life and work of Nelson Mandela. An autobiography is, understandably, biased. If you write an account of your own life, you are not going to speak ill of yourself. Yet, reading through the book, it struck me that Mandela admitted that he had made mistakes. I found the account of his life imbued with a sense of modesty, humility and dignity that you do not find in many politicians.    Mandela showed himself to be a man of another order when he did not turn the table to oppress the minority whites when he became president but, rather, called everyone to the table.    It is one of the interesting stories of our time: a man who spent 27 1/2 years as a political prisoner of his country because of his fight against apartheid ends up, in his old age, the president of that country. One of his deputy presidents is the previous president who headed the party that had put the system in place.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|I was such a big Ray Charles fan that I have to say something about this work.  Truth is, after I read Ms. Quido's review, I determined she said what I would have said.  Buy it. And if you want more details, read Ms. Quido's review.  She got it right.  Despite her reviews having composition errors (e.g.,using who's for whose) and a fear of EVER using the objective tense (him and me) even in an objective phrase (must be he and I), this review of Ray's last recording efforts is right on, if not done with an economy of words.  Again, buy it.
B0006OBPTA|1.0|Here I sit anxiously awaiting my boxed set, just busting at the seams at the opportunity to see KKI in widescreen.  I am a huge KK fan ... I have the first one on Beta, VHS, and DVD.  I also have the soundtrack on cassette and CD.  I have the paperback book versions, some of the action figures, and the script.  I love this film; I know this film.  I just popped the DVD in and to my dismay I see that even though the box says remastered for HD, absolutely nothing was done to clean the film up.  It has the same dust specks in it that the original DVD had in it.  What's worse, this isn't even widescreen!!!!!  The lowlifes simply cut off the top and bottom of the original and called it widescreen.  I compared it to my original full screen and you are missing parts of the picture.  I am very very disappointed and will be seeking to get my money back due to their false advertising.
B00000JCOV|4.0|\\"Slipknot\\" is a good start for the 9-man band but this album isn't nearly as good as \\"Iowa\\" and \\"Volume 3\\". Iowa is less rap-oriented and Vol. 3 shows that slipknot has amazing talent they don't necesarily show in this album. <br /> <br />Slipknot's self titled album has some of my favorite songs on it ( (sic), Eyeless, Liberate) but the album as a whole really is not very good. It starts off strong but the album has many weak songs towards the end, songs that are basically just rap with a hard screaming chorus. The album doesn't end very well either, Scissors is a creepy song that isn't enjoyable at all to me. I suggest getting Slipknot's other 2 albums first and then getting this one if you're a fan, since it is worth it for the few songs on it that are great.

6305750750|4.0|We all know the orginal trilogy is like god of movies etc...But you must look at this film differently from the orginal trilogy. If you were to compare a book to a film, obviously everyone is going to say the book is better because it is more detailed. Truly you can not compare a book to a film. A Film is not composed of the same material exactly to a book. Yes a film has chapters, and so does books but films are a layout, almost like an outline. Everyone compared Return of the King movie to a book. I love Rotk and the book but i do not compare them. I actually think the movie was much more well accumulated and put together than the Book! Star Wars Episode I is a totally new saga but the same criteria as the orginal trilogy. YOu must stop comparing the two. Stop complaining about the ships. You must realize that the whole triolgy is NOT COMPLETED!!!!!!!!!! SO WHY DO YOU JUDGE IT AND CALL IT ABSOLUTE GARBAGE????? EPISODE III, REVENGE OF THE SITH HASN'T EVEN BEEN SEEN! It will all make sense when the final chapter is completed. You must also relaize that Darth Maul is not a major villian! Darth Sidious is always the major villian. Lucas is trying to show you the Deception that Sidious unleashes upon the galaxy. Did you really think One Man and one apprentice could take over the galaxy? Sidious uses different people as his servants! Lucas said in the DVD, that he is the Puppet Master. That is what a Puppet Master does! He controls everyone and takes away free will. It's the power that evil grows from. You must also realize that even that Darth Sidious is the Enemy! It was not Vader! Sidious is truly the Personification of Absolute Evil.  Darth Maul is just a pawn used in Sidious's scheme. Another thing is that many say it does not remind them of anything from the Orginal Trilogy. How can it remind you, its a totally different World! Its Before The Dark Times! Before the Empire! Lucas has to show you how the Empire was all accumulated and brought together. It did not happen over NIGHT!!!!!! Jar Jar Binks is another issue. He is not really a big deal. He's just a crazy character in Star Wars. Yet i think he should had been protrayed different and a little more serious. He was designed for children just like Wicket. Yet no one said anything about Gollum or Wicket when they were made! I love Lotr but i think Gollum is an annoying S.O.B and i hate that character but he fits the PLot and Story! Jar Jar is just one of those characters that fits the Story! O and for Die Hard Fans Out there, which i could be considered one....Accept the fact that Anakin was born from a Virgin! Except it! it's in the Jedi Prophecy! That makes the Chosen One so significant. Well i am sorry for those who do not beleive in Incarnation. I don't care because i believe in incarnation, such as Jesus Christ's birth. Besides the point, I used to hate Episode I. Now i respect it more because i am realizing that they had to be done this way! People should not see Star Wars as a layout or blue print because of how the orginals were made. People should not point their fingers and say things like, \\"O in Episode I, it should had been like A New Hope.\\" Its a totally different story! And i hate when people say it does not seem like the orginals because of the ships and etc. You must understand that this is a time of peace, glory and greatness before the Empire! This is when the Republic were in charge of Affairs! i actually think Episode I is better than Episode II! Wait and see for Episode III. i just know Lucas has something up his sleeves that will blow the fans away!!!!!!
078322611X|5.0|Field of Dreams is a modren day fable.  A fantasy played out not in an enchanted realm of dragons and faeries, but in a middle American Iowa cornfield.  Costner plays Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer who one day hears a voice telling him \\"If you build it, they will come.\\"  Build what and who will come?  Well the answer is, of course, a regulation baseball diamond right in the middle of his cornfield.  Townspeople think Ray is nuts but his idealistic wife Annie (Amy Madigan) has faith in Ray.<br /><br />Ray continues to get new messages from the voice that leads him to Boston to track down a reclusive author Terrence Mann (James Earl Jones) where, in films funniest moment, Ray explains to Mann that he has to take him to a baseball game at Fenway Park and Ray fakes having a gun in his jacket to coerce the skeptical writer.<br /><br />Eventually THEY do come...spirits of deceased baseball players, right out of his cornfield to play ball on Ray's diamond, including Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) the wrongfully banned player from the Black Sox scandal.  All the while Ray's brother in law Mark (Tim Busfield) is trying to get Ray to sell his farm before the bank forecloses on it.  Eventually, as in any mythical fairy tale, all things work out and one could end the film by saying they all lived happily ever after!<br /><br />Costner's \\"aw shucks\\" All-American boy style was perfectly suited to his role in this film.  James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster (as Moonlight Graham) also stood out although Liotta's Jackson was a bit too refined for a guy who was supposed to be something of a country bumpkin.  This is a magnificent film and one of the best of the 1980's.<br /><br />This 15th anniversary release features a host of special features including a remastered anamorphic presentation of the film.  There's a new 90 minute documentary, A roundtable discussion between Costner and several former pro baseball players discussing the film, deleted scenes, Director commentary, a visit to \\"moonlight Graham's\\" hometown, and much more.  Truly a worthwhile collectors edition.  Highest recommendation!own, and much more.  Truly a worthwhile collectors edition.  Highest recommendation!
B00006JJ2Y|5.0|I put off getting this album for years, due to the bad rap it's gotten as a collection of drunken, rambling monologues. It is way better than that. It does contain some rambling monologues, notably in Sweet Jane (which is about half rambling and half music) and Walk on the Wild Side. (In the latter, Lou says he got so tired of it that he couldn't play it anymore, but now he can, and then he talks for 17 minutes rather than sing a word of it.) The reviewer \\"x\\" described the album very well (\\"It is like going to the zoo, only to walk by the Polar Bear exhibit to see that the animals have eaten the zookeepers.\\") I can listen to the real songs more often than the rambling ones, but the real songs are indispensable. \\"Street Hassle\\" is absolutely incendiary, and I am very fond of the thundering, mumbled \\"Leave Me Alone\\" which bears no resemblance to the studio version. The band was absolutely on fire at this show. I've seen Lou three times, all in relatively recent years. What I wouldn't give to have seen him on this tour.... (Also, despite some complaints about the sound quality, it sounded fine to me, and I am pretty picky.)

B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Celine Dion is on fire.  This is an excellent contemporary pop album, one of the best (if not THE best) of Celine Dion's career.  The singing she displays here is clearly the singing of someone at the top of their game.  The usual cast of supporting characters is there (they're the \\"4 Types\\" in the title), and they give her the usual Cadillac treatment she deserves. Great writing, great producing, great playing, great fun! <br /> <br />Whether it's in Paris or in Vegas, this stuff just works.  Celine Dion delivers maximum satisfaction with almost everything she touches, and this is no exception. <br /> <br />Do you need to speak French to like this album?  The short answer is no, but it would help.  By continuing to produce top-notch efforts like this, it will be only a matter of time before she takes one of her French songs on the American Adult Contemporary or even pop chart.
0156027321|5.0|With over 1250 reviews already registered for LIFE OF PI, I first thought there could be nothing more to say about this marvelous novel. But after scanning the most recent 100 reviews, I began to wonder what book many of those reviewers had read. Had I relied on 98 of those reviews, I would have expected a far different book than the one I actually read.     Let's begin with what LIFE OF PI isn't. It's not a Man against Nature survival story. It's not a story about zoos or wild animals or animal husbandry. It's not ROBINSON CRUSOE or SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON. It's not a literary version of CASTAWAY or OPEN WATER, and it's not a \\"triumph against all odds, happily ever after\\" rescue story. To classify it as such would be like classifying THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA as a story about a poor fisherman or MOBY DICK as a sea story. Or THE TRIAL as a courtroom drama, THE PLAGUE as a story of an epidemic, HEART OF DARKNESS as a story about slavery, or ANIMAL FARM as an animal adventure.    Martel's story line is already well-known: a fifteen-year-old boy, the son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, India survives a shipwreck several days out of Manila. He is the lone human survivor, but his lifeboat is occupied by a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, an injured zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan. In relatively short order and true Darwinian fashion, their numbers are reduced to just two: the boy Piscene Molitor Patel, and the tiger, Richard Parker. By dint of his zoo exposure and a fortuitously positioned tarpaulin, Pi (as he is called) manages to establish his own territory on the lifeboat and even gains alpha dominance over Richard Parker. At various points in their 227-day ordeal, Pi and the tiger miss being rescued by an oil tanker, meet up with another shipwreck survivor, and discover an extraordinary algae island before finally reaching safety.     When Pi retells the entire story to two representatives of the Japanese Ministry of Transport searching for the cause of the sinking, they express deep disbelief, so he offers them a second, far more mundane but believable story that parallels the first one. They can choose to believe the more fantastical first one despite its seeming irrationality (Pi is, after all, an irrational number) and its necessary leap of faith, or they can accept the second, far more rational version, more heavily grounded in our everyday experiences.     LIFE OF PI is an allegory, the symbolic expression of a deeper meaning through a tale acted out by humans, animals, and in this case, even plant life. Yann Martel has crafted a magnificently unlikely tale involving zoology and botany, religious experience, and ocean survival skills to explore the meaning of stories in our lives, whether they are inspired by religion to explain the purpose of life or generated by our own psyches as a way to understand and interpret the world around us.     Martel employs a number of religious themes and devices to introduce religion as one of mankind's primary filters for interpreting reality. Pi's active adoption and participation in Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity establish him as a character able to relate his story through the lens of the world's three major religions. Prayer and religious references abound, and his adventures bring to mind such Old Testament scenes as the Garden of Eden, Daniel and the lion's den, the trials of Job, and even Jonah and the whale. Accepting Pi's survival story as true, without supporting evidence, is little different than accepting New Testament stories about Jesus. They are matters of faith, not empiricism.    In the end, however, LIFE OF PI takes a broader view. All people are storytellers, casting their experiences and even their own life events in story form. Martel's message is that all humans use stories to process the reality around them, from the stories that comprise history to those that explain the actions and behaviors of our families and friends. We could never process the chaotic streamof events from everyday life without stories to help us categorize and compartmentalize them. Yet we all choose our own stories to accomplish this - some based on faith and religion, some based on empiricism and science. The approach we choose dictates our interpretation of the world around us.     LIFE OF PI bears a faint resemblance to the movie BIG FISH, also a story about storytelling and how we understand and rationalize our own lives through tales both mundane and tall.  Martel's book is structured as a story within a story within a story, planned and executed in precisely 100 chapters as a mathematical counterpoint to the endlessly irrational and nonrepeating value of pi. The book is alternately harrowing and amusing, deeply rational and scientific but wildly mystical and improbable. It is also hugely entertaining and highly readable, as fluid as the water in which Pi floats. Anyone who enjoys literature as a vehicle for contemplating the human condition should find in LIFE OF PI a delicious treat.
B000002GWN|5.0|\\"Miles of Aisles\\" is one of those albums I got on vinyl intially and upgraded to tape, then to CD.  The music is just that timeless.  What was a two-disk vinyl showcases the gamut of Mitchell's early work.  We go from thoughtful \\"Cactus Tree\\" to fun: \\"You Turn me on:  I'm a Radio\\".  The digital version of this CD is definitely an improved master from the vinyl--a lot less of the white noise you hear on live recordings. This is definitely a must for Joni Mitchell fans and even a good place to start a collection.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Raging Bull is an incredible film featuring some of the greatest directing, cinematography, and acting ever to grace the silver screen.  Such an incredible movie also has to have a strong foundation in the form of a powerful script, moving music and incredible set work.  In all, this is a movie that comes together on all fronts, and it's a credit to Scorcese for making that happen.<br /><br />Jake LaMotta is a fighter who relies on his physical gifts over his mind.  Over the years, the mindless beatings he allows himself to take take a toll on his mind and body.  His decline is a metaphor for his personal life as well.  He neglects his wife and family just as much as he neglects his health.  He eventually loses everything, but retains a certain pride in his thickheadedness.<br /><br />Yes it's true, LaMotta was not an angel.  But this film is great because of its honesty.  Deniro's portrayal of LaMotta is legendary.  His talents were never better used in a motion picture.<br /><br />Joe Pesci gives a strong performance in his supporting role as Jake's brother Joey. Cathy Moriarty gives an incredible performance as Jake's Wife.  I was surprised to learn she was only 19 years old and cast mainly because of looks.  She is very believable throughout the entire movie, as the wild young sexpot and the resolute divorcee.<br /><br />The fight scenes bring out the best in the film's cinematography.  Every scene is expertly framed in the ring with realism and sharp contrast.  This is the closest a non-boxer will ever get to stepping inside the ring.  The music is perfectly timed with the action, highlighting the beauty and brutality of this blood sport.<br /><br />The rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson is expertly done.  \\"You never hurt me,\\" sums up Jake's pride after Robinson inevitably outclasses him.<br /><br />From world champion to lounge bum, Jake LaMotta's rise and fall come to life in this film.  Buy it, study it, watch it over and over.  This is an incredible edition as well, with great clarity and nice features.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ures.      HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0006399FS|3.0|On first listen I'm not very impressed...they seem to be hovering back towards their 80s sound. 'Pop' was an attempt at something innovative and different, I think it works pretty well; 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' is even better, a fantastic collection of great pop songs...but the tunes on Atomic Bomb aren't as catchy, or unique, imho. <br /> <br />I've never been a big fan of U2's 80s sound though, so if you do like their earlier material, you may well love this album; as the title says though, it's simply not for me.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|A long time fan of Pat Metheny I look forward to the groups new releases. I have listened to all and kept those, that were to me, fit for my collection. After so many south american smooth jazz sets, almost all of the geffen discography, some warner, I had to stop and truly listen to this one. It was to me a throwback to his ECM days, a joy! As falls Wichita... and the dramatic Quartet session, warner, come to mind. An intelligent piece of music! Thank you!
B000067J1H|3.0|It is no surprise that so many reviewers have gushed with superlatives about this movie being the greatest ever made, etc. Director David Fincher uses boldly creative filming techniques that produce an innovative, flashy movie that has the adrenaline rush of skydiving on speed. Add to that the movie's grab-bag anti-establishment philosophy of Buddhist non-attachment and anarchist smash the system direct action, fuel it all with rage, and you have a truly heady mix, particularly for the young who are experiencing their first exposure to these ideas.<br /><br />The problem that I have with Fight Club is that it is the poster child of sophomoric movies. It combines valuable philosophical insights about our consumer society and its ills with outrageous foolishness about both the extent of those ills and the solutions to them. Though it sets up a conflict between Ed Norton's nameless protagonist and his alter ego and nemesis Tyler (played in his trademark over the top style by Brad Pitt) even in its ultimate resolution it still comes down to simplistic, foolish wish fulfillment. It is completely normal to find this profound at twenty, but if at forty you still find it profound, you should seriously question your maturity level.<br /><br />The other great sin of this movie is its ridiculous plot twist. It is the worst example of a violation of internal logic in any movie that I have watched in recent memory. This cheap, ill-conceived twist hurts the credibility of what is otherwise a bold and daring cinematic creation. Even given the movie's sophomoric philosophy, I would have still given it four stars had this silly twist not totally ruined the movie's credibility for me.<br /><br />Cinematically, Fight Club is bold, flashy, and innovative.

B00062ZE44|5.0|Within Temptation is a talented band from Holland or Netherlands if you prefer who's lead singer is Sharon den Adel and she's as pretty as her voice is. There's a video of one of the songs on the album and she's a knockout. The music is symphonic metal with orchestral and choir backing. It is highly melodic and enchanting. If you know and like the band Nightwish then this is for you.<br /><br />Some of the best songs are \\"See Who I Am\\", which starts with a huge sound then smartly slows down only to come back with the big catchy chorus, \\"Jillian (I'd give my Heart)\\" is just great with it's gigantic intro followed by the choir and Sharon's impeccable voice on the choruses and Stand my Ground\\" is slick the way it starts out sedately then explodes into a \\"don't mess with me\\" warrior mentality with the orchestra and choir. \\"Angels\\" is kind of appropriate with a heavenly Angelic sound and what can you say about \\"Pale\\"? Has there ever been a prettier melody in a song?<br /><br />Taken as a whole there isn't much variety since each song does resemble the others but that homogenous sound doesn't bother me. In some ways it reminds me of a fine musical score where a change of style could be jolting.<br /><br />I am really amazed that there are people that gave this album less than four stars. From beginning to end it's a great album. Is it better than their previous blockbuster, Mother Earth? It's close, I'd say probably not but only by the slimest of margins.<br /><br />Similar Bands<br /><br />Nightwish, Edenbridge, Visions of Atlantis, Dreams of Sanity, Enya, Loreena McKinnett
B00006AW2M|1.0|This is no 'response' to  sgt. peppers. it is a blatant rip off. the stones have always been unoriginal hangers-on, making a career ripping other people off. how the beatles ever tolerated these posers hanging around is beyond me. you think the stones proved their originality by continuing to make innovative music after the beatles broke up? tell me your favorite stones song or record - I doubt it's anything after 1970. wait a second... what exactly has this band done since 1970?...
0670033375|2.0|Mr. Diamond has sifted through several millenia of human history, and the most relevant cases he can come up with are . . . Easter Island?  Greenland?  The Anasazi tribe?  Were there no examples of larger societies available?  Presumably, the bulk of his readership will be Americans, but it is difficult to understand how a nation of nearly 300 million people is supposed to draw conclusions from cases of tiny, remote societies going adrift.  Had he developed his theories from an examination of, say, the fall of Rome, or of the Mongol Empire, they may have been more compelling.  Any attempt to extrapolate findings from communities of 5,000 to nations of 300 million is going to be flawed.

0393317552|2.0|Mr. Diamond seems to have written this book as a means of refuting the old theories about non-Europeans being backward, and in a classic case of political correctness, he actually argues that the inhabitants of New Guinea are more intelligent than their European counterparts.  (Yes, New Guinea--the same country in which cannibalism is believed to still go on in some areas.)  Here's the gist of the author's argument: Europe's dominance of the world was almost solely an accident of geography; Europe had more natural resources (both plant and animal) than any other continent, and even people stupider than New Guineans couldn't have screwed it up.   <br /> <br />While there is no doubt that Europe has been blessed with a favorable climate, good soils and plentiful wildlife, the same can be said for many other regions (such as North America, Australia and even West Africa), and Diamond's attempt to explain the difference between them left me unconvinced.  Diamond's theory also completely fails to explain the success of Japan--a country that possesses few natural resources.  In short, this is a classic case of a guy using selective data to prove a questionable point.  Probably not worth your money.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|MJ is the greatest musician of our time. This collection, which is rather expensive, is worth every penny. The new songs are for the most part good, and the old ones are just classic.
B00005Y2EL|3.0|Billed by myself as the \\"forgotten Thin Lizzy album\\" Renegade often gets maligned like the other Snowy White effort \\"Chinatown\\". I'll say that \\"Renegade\\" is not quiet as good as \\"Chinatown\\" it is, however, a high quality effort from a then veteran band working against the tide of new british metal and american alloy bands that were sweeping the music scene. As with \\"Chinatown\\" guitarist Snowy White  make his mark with the stream-lined boogie number \\"Leave This Town\\" (a Sugar Blues re-deaux)that is in the dance friendly hard rock vein that Thin Lizzy has always mined with great sucess. \\"Angel of Death\\" and the tital track are always in my Thin Lizzy mix tape I make from time to time for long road trips (they're that good). Other tracks are equally sublime with \\"Fats\\" most notably jumping out as an incredible ode to jazz great Fats Domino. \\"Hollywood\\" is another winner from this lineup with Phil's lyrics and vocals carrying the song. In many ways this is still vintage Lizzy, but it has a then modern sound to it that causes friction among many LIzzy purists. Renegade is basically just another quality entry to Phil Lynott's legacy of making top notch quality hard rock. A genre that has few bands of much noteriety over a career that lasted as long as Thin Lizzy. Pick it up if you haven't heard it, or ignored it in the past.
1878424319|5.0|This is the second book I read by Toltec Master/Scholar Don Miguel Ruiz having read his Mastery of Love last Summer.  In desperate need of trying to repair my own troubled mind and heart, it opened my eyes and I realized that this book is really a solid foundation of personal wisdom ad growth.  As I learned over this past Summer a lot of the ideologies and structures we used in daily life are nothing more than falsehoods(dreams) and we can(should) be open to something so much greater than what we currently know.  Having also recently opened myself up to The Course of Miracles I see some very strong parallels here with this book as well.<br /><br />Who can not learn from the knowledge that is being presented here?  The Four Agreements are:<br /><br />1.)Be Impeccable with your Word:<br /><br /> Your words are your sword and also your wand be aware how you use them.<br /><br />Say \\"What you mean and mean what you say\\"<br /><br />2.)Don't take Anything Personally:  One agreement that I am constantly faced with and constantly trying to utilize.<br /><br />3.) on't Make Assumptions:  Another agreement WE could ALL use.  (Think what this world would be like if we didn't make assumptions)<br /><br />4.) Always Do Your Best!<br /><br />The Prayers are the end of the book are beautiful and inspiring, especially the prayer on love that again proves to me, WE (EVERYONE) are ALL connected on this planet, even if it appears to some as only temporary.
0316172324|4.0|After his bestseller [...]The Tipping Point what has [...]Malcolm Gladwell done for an encore? Written another blend of captivating stories and easy doses of social psychology, that - like its predecessor - will no doubt become a favourite topic at middle class dinner parties over coming months.     His new book is called [...]Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, and it's the subtitle that explains his latest thesis. It is about \\"the power of knowing ...in the first two seconds...\\" In short, first impressions count. But often they can also mislead.     Gladwell dubs the ability in \\"those fleeting moments\\" to make rapid judgements based on limited information `thin slicing', and some people are remarkably good at it. He maintains it should be taken seriously; it is not a magical gift but \\"an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves\\". Of course this is not really `thinking without thinking'. It's the kind of thinking that observant people can form after years, sometimes decades, of experience and study in a specific field (greek antiquities, say, or food tasting). A more accurate subtitle would have been `the power of observation and accumulated experience', but I guess that didn't test well in the focus groups.     Gladwell is always a good read, so I doubt too many readers will mind when they realise his latest book lacks a strong, original thesis like [...]The Tipping Point. The weaker central argument does, however, expose a mechanistic style that can grate. For example chapter four opens with the following sentence: \\"Paul Van Riper is tall and lean with a gleaming dome and wire-rimmed glasses.\\" We soon learn he served as a marine in Vietnam, was nicknamed `Rip' by his troops, had \\"a crisp voice, low to middle tones\\", was confident, strict, fair, a student of war, was \\"always very aggressive\\" - but in a nice way - and he lead \\"from the front\\". I guess the author never read [...]Strunk & White and its famous dictum.     Most readers will forgive the occasional overripe paragraph because the stories are apt and well told. Like his first book, this one provides readers with fascinating office or dinner party titbits. And for those in the United States, you may still have time to catch up on the tail end of his [...]book tour.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|It's silly to downrate something for what it isn't. Maybe it isn't \\"jazz\\" in some traditional sense, but we don't listen to music for what it isn't. <br /> <br />What it is: A composed and considered series of interconnected statements, spoken in the vernacular of jazz and other contemporary musics. A suite, a concerto, a \\"concept.\\" A long, complex, layered, thoughtful and very controlled sequence of melody and texture, rhythm and expression.  <br /> <br />It continues to reveal itself listening upon listening, and while the emotion is contained and constrained, it is most definitely there. Like a newly encountered personality, it must be explored before the feeling reveals itself. The rewards are commensurate with the effort. <br /> <br />This disc has not been out of my player for a week. It's music you can immerse yourself in; it's music you can study. You can applaud the virtuosity of the players, or admire and analyse the sophistication of the writing and arranging.  <br /> <br />The PMG has risen to a new level here, and elevates the listener in the process. I can't recommend this work highly enough.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead does everything a zombie movie needs to do, and it also manages to be an intelligent comedy that says something not only about the protagonist Shaun (Simon Pegg), but about the Britain around him as well.  He is, we have the impression, an observant, smart, young-ish man if given the opportunity.  You might actually say he's got what it takes to be a leader of other men and women, except there are a few things working against him: <br /> <br />The first is his daily routine, which is fit for a zombie.  Every morning he arises, has coffee, toast with jam, dresses for work, heads around the corner to the local Quick-E-Mart, then off to work where his co-workers are practically half his age.  Not exactly inspiring; but throught it all we have the sense that were he spurred by something, he might transcend his situation and become what he was meant to be. <br /> <br />The second thing holding him back is his friend Ed (Nick Frost), who has never left the pub in his mind.  He's fat, obnoxious, vulgar, probably smelly, and particularily charming in those qualities around Shaun's girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).  Ed keep Shaun firmly ensconsed in the local pub, \\"The Winchester,\\" and is his compatriot in underachievment.  Such is the extent of Ed's underachieving ways that when he picks up the apartment, we're not even sure he's done it since the place becomes messy before Shaun gets home.  He does have redeeming qualities; at least he's not Pete, the responsible one, whom Shaun would be were it not for the world around him. <br /> <br />Suddenly; in the midst of routine, drinking at the Winchester, dealing with his stepdad Phil (Bill Nighy), and trying to patch things up with Liz, zombies begin to walk the earth.  The explanation (and it's very brief) is that it's a sickness infecting the locals.  Of course this is a commentary on everyday Britains and their routine; emblematic in Shaun.  He is basically the original zombie before people start eating brains.  He has no variety in his life, no hopes of breaking out of that humdrum because he lacks the ambition within him.  Basically, zombies are humans whose life have betrayed their minds; the only difference with Shaun is that he doesn't moan, lumber around and try to eat people. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, the emergence of zombies gives him exactly what he needs to at least touch on his potential.  His stepfather succumbs to the zombies, only after an actually very heartfelt speech that is probably one of three sincere moments that evoke both pity and fear.  His problems with Liz evaporate in the face of the greater good, and she actually starts defending his decisions to the obnoxious David who's only there to second-guess Shaun.  It's okay though; he dies badly. <br /> <br />The film has some truly hilarious scenes, espcially when they decide which LPs to throw at the zombies to try and decapitate them.  The Batman soundtrack doesn't survive this round.  Of course who would have thought a cricket bat would work so well?  It's a solid zombie-crushing implement; a piece of life in the zombie world. <br /> <br />The extras are great to watch, espcially the Zomb-o-meter, which acts like VH-1's old \\"Pop Up Videos\\" where trivia and info pops up on screen as you watch the film. <br /> <br />This is definitely a film for any zombie freak; it does something that a lot of good zombie movies don't make you do, which is laugh deliberately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000001FS3|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite album released by U2. The first three songs are well known and great, but my favorite song on Joshua Tree is \\"Exit\\". It is quiet then loud, fierce yet beautiful, and probably my favorite U2 song ever. It also annoys me how \\"Running to Stand Still\\" is overlooked and under-appreciated. This slow building ballad is one of Bono's best lyrical works. I love it. It is unbelievable to me how these songs still applys to today even though it was released more than 15 years ago, especially \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". I recommend that everyone who enjoys real and good music should by this CD. I also recommend that everyone pick up 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb', 'War', and 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. Finally, I believe that the second track \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" describes the continuous experimentation of U2's 25 year career.
0385504209|3.0|To say this is a work of genius, as I've heard, is an overstatement. Sure, it's a fun book. There's a lot of action. There's a sufficient level of drama. Dan Brown's writing is such that the reader is brought into, and through the story, at a frenetic pace.<br /><br />Speaking from a rather laid back Catholic's perspective, I'm not sure I'd consider this book to be the \\"new epiphany.\\" It's ruffled some feathers simply because it's an idea that's seldom talked about. Scientists don't care too much, and the conservatives don't want to hear it. Quite frankly, if you are comfortable and strong in your faith (be it monotheism, atheism,or polytheism) than feel free to read this if you want to know what all of the fuss is about. If you're not grounded in your faith, or are lost, I'm not sure I'd recommend it.<br /><br />Dan Brown paints a very good picture. His sense of adventure is laid into the pages quite well. This book will keep you wanting to read at times. Other times, I'm sorry to say, I was fine with closing the book, shutting the light off, and going to sleep. Other books (Eye of the Needle by Ken Follett and Gemini Contenders by Robert Ludlum) had that gripping suspense and believability that I lost hours of sleep.<br /><br />The character development is alright (Langdon's character is developed in the prequel Angels & Demons). The plot is good. The pace is great. The descriptions of objects and settings are quite wonderful. However, in the end, I found myself saying \\"All of the fuss was for this?\\" I just think there was just too much fuss over this book. Controversial? Absolutely. A great work? I don't think so.
B00006V9A0|3.0|I gave this CD only 3 stars since most Nirvana fans already have all their albums and YKYR. I bought this to complete my Nirvana collection. All the songs here are remastered, so they sound brilliant. If your just getting into Nirvana and don't own a single album by them then this would be a good cd to start with. There should have been more unreleased songs on here thats my only complaint. You do get all their hits on one disc. Go out and pick this up!
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Well, now...aside from condensing a 10-year seige into a 2-week affair, I'd have to say that this film has some REALLY impressive elements. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt--Hey, that fancy battle move is worth the whole price.  I thought Pitt did a wonderful job of conveying the \\"victory or death\\" credo of the Greek warrior.  He's a deliciously moody Achilles; and the nuances of soldiering philosophy \\"a conscience does not become a sword.\\" is well carried off.  Pitt often gets less credit than he deserves, I think, because he makes it look too easy, and his performance in TROY is much more than adequate.  He creates an Achilles worthy of Homer. <br /> <br />Olando Bloom and Eric Bana are equisitely matched at brothers Paris and Hector.  Eric Bana, especially, delivers a stirring performance of the antithesis of Achilles--a warrior with a conscience, a soldier with a reason to live (loving wife and family), a man who fights for his country, not personal glory.  Bana probably should have been considered for an Oscar.  Orlando's looks and the youthful impetuosity he gives Paris are nicely done. <br /> <br />Great to see Sean Bean as Odysseus.  He was everything that planner should be--manipulative, winning. <br /> <br />Peter O'Toole--Well, what can one say?  His performance as Priam is exquisite--especially as he pleads with Achilles for the body of his beloved son.  Unfortunately, Peter learned a long time ago that Oscar hates him...sad, isn't it? <br /> <br />The weakest link is probably the portrayal of Helen.  She's the one character you'd probably want to know more about and yet she impresses the audience as a dishrag...it's a wonder Hector didn't feed her to Agamemnon for dinner just to be rid of her cow-eyed whinning.  I think maybe Paris might have helped him do it, actually.  She certainly was tiresome.  I think Helen just might have had a little more back bone than that--after all, she certainly wasn't ignorant of what the result of her actions would be. <br /> <br />BUT...This film, for any flaws, has an \\"old-time-epic\\" feel about it that I don't think has been that well captured since BEN HUR.  The thousand ships, the Trojan Plains, the City Gates...it's all pure majesty. <br /> <br />My family was mixed...My daughter, husband, and I liked it very much.  My son villified it for not being chapter and verse to THE ILLIAD.  But the bottom line is, it's worth a look...it'll make a rainy afternoon fun! <br /> <br />
B00005QDW5|5.0|I see alot of people complaining about a best of. You get all the greatest Floyd songs on two discs what more can you ask.I have been a Floyd fan since i was fourteen, so ive been listening to them for about four and a half years now and they rock. If you like lugging 5 albums around with you in your car or small ass truck like me then get this 2 disc set and you'll be happy. You won't have to pop out one disc to put in a better one. I like best of albums cause if you have the originals you don't have to worry about scratching them when storing them away. All of you complaining you obviously don't know a good deal when you see one so good luck buying cds idiots.
B00005U122|2.0|I wonder if it's ever occurred to Roger Waters that for all of his carping about how the concert milieu has diminished the performer's ability to communicate directly with the audience, he plays right into that stereotype of \\"big, bigger, biggest\\" and has since THE WALL. What is so freaking \\"direct\\" about all of this stage puffery on display in this video? What, Rog, too scared to find out that if you stripped all of it away, people would find out you had nothing to say?<br /><br />On it's own terms, IN THE FLESH LIVE makes for a decent enough rock concert spectacle, but, please Roger, spare me the sanctimonious garbonzo about audiences being \\"amused to death.\\" Want to communicate directly? How about showing up with just a guitar and see what happens? Until that time, welcome to the machine!
6305428220|5.0|The Faculty is an amazing film. Period. With enough swearing in it to make your mother get pissed off and a whole load of brilliant young actors (including Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett and the sensational Clea DuVall), this is a film for keeps.<br /><br />Six misfit teens that don't really fit in with each other end up having to join forces when they realize that their teachers really are psycho aliens from outer space! There's Casey (Elijah Wood), the Steven King-esque nerd, Delilah (Jordana Brewster) the cheerleader/newspaper editor, Stan (Shawn Hatosy) the jock who wants to focus on his grades, Stokely (Clea DuVall) the goth, possibly a lesbian and the fountain of all knowledge on science fiction, Mary Beth (Laura Harris) the new girl from Atlanta, and Zeke (Josh Hartnett) the bad-boy who's the school's local drug dealer.<br /><br />This film is pretty scary on the first viewing, and pretty gruesome at bits, but in a good way! The best performance out of the senior members of the cast has to be that of Robert Patrick as the Coach. (\\"I've always wanted to do that....\\" To understand it, watch the film!)
B000002UA5|5.0|Roger Waters and David Gilmour have both gone on record as being profoundly dismissive of UMMAGUMMA. Maybe so, but I have to say that I find the live disc on this 2-CD set and most of the four individual pieces by the band's members that take up all of disc 2 much more interesting than anything from THE WALL. There's something engaging about hearing them all experiment with music and the possibilities in ordinary sounds. Yes, to a certain extent, \\"getting into it\\" might have meant that some people had to chemically alter their brains before they put it on, but that was never a prerequisite to my enjoying it. The live disc simply shows off Floyd at it's spacey best without all the pomp that managed to sink their quality during the last years of the original band. Listening to \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\" here and then comparing to the version Waters presents on his IN THE FLESH concert tour album, it's hard not to see the latter version as a pale ghost of the original, all slickness and no power.<br /><br />UMMAGUMMA was a high-water mark for the band, whether they choose to acknowledge it or not. Who knew that 4 years later DARK SIDE OF THE MOON would change things for them so radically?
B000002L68|5.0|What can be said about \\"Purple Rain\\" that has not already been said?  You probably know how brilliant this album is by now.  It is magnificently eccentric, and it feels like it's driven by a force and a spirit rarely seen in popular music.  This album is simply full of strong, passionate songwriting and really interesting musical ideas.  I would not want anyone to tamper with the brilliant experience that this album is, but a re-release with an additional bonus disc would be absolutely wonderful----as long as it doesn't include that totally lame \\"Mountaineer\\" song by one of the side acts in the movie:-).  I'm just kidding (and I know that the title is really \\"Modernaire\\") but a bonus disc would truly be great.  I would give anything to have that full extended version of \\"Let's go crazy\\" that they played at the beginning of \\"Purple Rain\\".  And I would love to hear the full extended version of \\"Computer Blue\\".  And I can not tell you how many times I re-wound and played back that 45 second part in the movie when Prince is alone playing an acoustic version of \\"Purple Rain\\" on the piano.  That is just one of the most beautiful things that I have ever heard.  If I could get a CD with a full length version of that acoustic \\"Purple Rain\\", that's all that I would listen to for a month.  And oh yeah, that acoustic version of \\"Computer Blue\\" that his father played on the piano is just as beautiful and amazing.  I would also love to have some of the performances from some of the other acts in the movie on CD.  So, Prince if you're out there and you're reading this, it would be GREAT if we could get such a bonus disc sometime in the near future.  You don't know how much us music lovers would appreciate it.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|Who doesn't know the Karate Kid?  Great film that too many high schoolers can relate to.  I give this set 4 stars because parts 3 and 4 are merely filler.  It also would have been nice to have commentary on all four films instead of just the first.  And why wasn't William Zabka included in the commentary?  And can someone please help me find the DVD rom game that is supposed to be on the Karate Kid 2?  Still the strength of the first film, and to a lesser extent, the second one merits 4 stars.  Plus, all four films for $25?  Can't beat that.
B000000OAN|5.0|Know what?  People can say all they want how much better they think other albums are, how Queen II, or Innuendo, or Greatest Hits, or whatever is better.  I'm sorry, but they're not. <br /> <br />Queen II is a good album, yes, but it's still Queen in the experimental stages, and some of the songs show the fact that they didn't collaborate as well as they did in later stages.  You can tell that Roger Taylor was trying to find his place (Loser in the End is terrible), while John didn't have as much of a role, and Freddie and Mercury were show stealers every time.  Just not pulled together as well. <br /> <br />Innuendo is, again, a good album, but the songs don't flow together as well as they do in A Night at the Opera.  It feels more like a collaboration of different songs rather than an album.  Plus, more of the songs are weak, and outside of the three great tracks most people mention, nothing feels like it has the Queen perfetionism. <br /> <br />A Night at the Opera is Queen at their best.  There's musical diversity, whimsy, charisma, emotion, terriffic songwriting, beautiful arrangements, awesome harmonies, what is probably their best song (Bohemian Rhapsody), and best of all, it feels like they were all working to make it the best that they could, and it shows. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, albums like Innuendo and Queen II are Five star albums, but I'd give ANATO a billion stars if I could.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is my second purchase from the amazingly talented group Nightwish. I read the reviews to this CD that stated not to start your Nightwish collection with this CD. I listened and purchased Century Child first. Although that CD is breathtaking in its own right, Once fulfilled the expectations I began to form from reading all the highly rated reviews. From beginning to end this disc takes you on a ride that starts amazing and ends unfathomable. Any expectation somebody could form about this CD will be proven ten fold.<br /><br />Songs like Nemo and Planet Hell make this a must have. But songs like Ghost Love Score and The Siren make this one of the best albums of the new millenium. This is vaguely reminescent of Century Child but is also a step in a new direction. The album starts off with Dark Chest of Wonders. A power-packed opener filled with angelic vocals and pulse pounding rhythms. Nemo is quite possibly the best song on here. It's a beautiful song that takes you on a ride you'll never want to stop. The only song that surpasses this is Ghost Love Score. This has quickly become my favorite song by Nightwish, the reason being that it contains everything you could ever want in a song. It's got some of the best vocals you'll ever hear and the way the band plays throughout is magnificent. I feel that Romanticide is unfairly judged, I find it to be a standout track on here. With just one listen-through that is the song that caught my ear the most, only with further, more detailed listens, did I find that there are other songs on here that deserve just as much attention than Romanticide. I definitely suggest people give that song more of a chance.<br /><br />Some of the best tracks on here are Nemo, Planet Hell, Romanticide, Ghost Love Score, and Higher Than Hope. This is one of those CDs that whenever you see it you just want to pop it into the closest CD player and take a trip through heaven. Every song has something about it that gets stuck in your head. But the best thing about this release is Tarja Turunen's voice. Where others opt for hoarse yells she chooses to belt out the notes only Anneke van Giersbergen from The Gathering can contend with. This release definitely deserves your attention.the best thing about this release is Tarja Turunen's voice.

B0006399FS|4.0|A lot of people feel the need to be excessively harsh with their reviews of this album.  What a lot of people are doing is they are comparing this album to \\"Achtung, Baby\\" and \\"Joshua Tree\\" - albums that set the bar so high that the only way to replicate their success would be to re-release them.  But when you compare this album to every other album being released in 2004, it's a great album.  No one likes filler and sure this album has some here and there.  But what makes it a great album are songs like \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Original of the Species\\" and \\"Yahweh\\".      6 out of 11 is not \\"Achtung, Baby\\".. but it still ranks better than most albums you'll spend your money on.    And for those of you who are giving up on U2, remember that after \\"Joshua Tree\\" came \\"Rattle and Hum\\".. but then they hit back with \\"Achtung, Baby\\".  Immediately after that, U2 lost a lot of us with \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\", but then reminded us of how great they are with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\".    And finally for those who hate this album because of Bono's image, I suppose he could always go back to the clown makeup he wore in the \\"Lemon\\" video.
B000000OF6|5.0|\\"Queen Greatest Hits, Vols. 1 & 2\\" is a great helping of some of the best hits from this England rock band. One word of advice: though it might seem like the first disc is much superior to the second by the song list, the second disc is VERY surprisingly good. <br /> <br />The first disc explores \\"Queen\\" in their prime: from the late 60's to early 80's. Songs like \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Bicycle Race\\", \\"Killer Queen\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" are classic rock favorites and placed as some of the best songs in music. The second disc is a great surprise. By looking at the song list, the only song many people will think they know is \\"Under Pressure\\", the popular mid 80's ballad Queen performed with David Bowie. However, there is SO much to enjoy on disc two. Disc two starts off about 1983 and finishes in the early 90's, before Freddie Mercury died of AIDS. \\"Hammer to Fall\\" and \\"Headlong\\" were popular FM rock staples in the 80's, \\"I Want to Break Free\\" became popular thanks to a Coca-Cola ad, and some of the other songs are worth checking out as well: \\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"I Want It All\\", the Bohemian Rapsody like \\"Innuendo\\", the plain silly \\"Invisible Man\\" are some of the better tracks on the second disc. <br /> <br />In the 70's/early 80's, \\"Queen\\" eptiomized hard rock at it's most colorful. Glam, flamboyant, arty, progressive, \\"Queen\\" also is arena rock at it's best: fist-pumpin', head boppin', crunching rock. This band is one of the finest, and \\"Greatest Hits Vols. 1 & 2\\" gives a good indiction of just how great they were through time.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Stripped is just an amazing album, it is better than her debut. Each single on here were good and she has left her young pop image behind to take on the role of a mature woman. She reflects on her past on some of the tracks and there is real emotion and feeling put into this album. She is not afraid to express her feelings and she takes charge and does not take crap from anybody. Step aside Britney and Jessica cuz the real diva is coming through!
B0000A118M|5.0|In my opinion, Jazz is the greatest form of music ever put on God's Green and Blue earth. If anything can show the genius of the human spirit, it's this. I'm just getting into jazz, but I love this album. It's pure golden. One of the reviewers was right: THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ALBUMS TO OWN. The overall message of the album is searching for something more and the complexity and chaos of the journey to that: A LOVE SUPREME. GOD: I can't give you enough praise for giving the world such a talent and tiny portion of Your power. John Coltrane: you music lives on in immortality for the soulful genius you gave this album. Get this...
B00003CXBH|4.0|Beautifully made film with memorable scenes and music. The vistas and favourable portrayals of simplicity and virtue capture the imagination. <br /> <br />Perhaps overly long and perhaps in need of further character development of de Niro's character. This is nevertheless a worthwhile film which anyone with an affection for the beauty of simplicity and the threat of misguided power will appreciate.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|It is so refreshing these days to listen to music and hear a pure non-altered voice. Michael's talent is undeniable and he sounds just as amazing live as he does on the recordings. The track \\"Home\\" proves he is also versatile and that he is not just a one trick pony. I look forward to his future albums where we will surely see him continue to evolve and grace us with his \\"magic\\".
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Finally, some real music from a truly talented musician! If everyone had to be as talented as Gavin, we would not have the amount of music we have today! He rocks all the right ways. So, buy this album, you won't regret it!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I loved this movie and the soundtrack so I went right out and purchased the U.S. version of the CD.  Then I read that there was an imported version that went for $23.00 and I ordered it thinking that it must be two CD's or more of the movies songs.  I was wrong.  With the exception of a couple song changes the U.S. and imported versions are the same and have the same amount of songs.  So my questions is...why did I pay $10 more for the imported version?
B00008CLOA|1.0|The original sound engineer Alan Parsons didn't participate in this project. Why? Maybe he doesn't like Sony. Instead, James Guthrie worked on it without the band. Which means that the most important contributors to the album never had their hands on this mix.     The SACD version is supposed to be an improvement, but it is simply BAD. It's weighted heavily toward surrounds when a voice kicks in so that the voice gets squelched and it bounces around from channel to channel in dizzying fashion for everything else. Just to insult us even more, Sony skimped on the stereo tracks for the CD-audio layer so that it sounds completely flat and lifeless. If you want a decent cut of Dark Side, you'll have to pick up the real CD.     Sony messed up one of the greatest albums of all time. Their fanatical obsession with DRM results in crippled products like this and they're forcing all of their artists into exclusive SACD releases when there's plenty of market for both SACD and DVD Audio. Don't support them. Boycott this travesty.     Don't buy SACD discs. Demand a DVD-A version done with the band's active participation!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|The best, so far.  more than Sinatra, Buble evokes the memory & style of the great Bobby Darin.  Not since Darin has a singer come along that can carry the torch in the tradition of Sinatra & all the greats!!  Watch out Connick, because Buble WILL leave you in the dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A first rate album.  BRAVO!!
B0002XDODU|4.0|These guys are usually bad ass but apparently they've gone soft in this latest album. True, it does have some awesome songs like Mein Teil and Reise Reise but it also has some extremely lame songs like Los and Amerika. What were they thinking when they wrote Los? They sound like some old geezer band playing out of their rocking chairs. Also, what's up with Amerika? Apparently they broke their promise about never doing a political song and stooped to the level of the typical Euro-whining about America.
0451191153|3.0|Many of the reviewers have commented on how reading this book has changed their lives.  I can see that, but I can't say I fall into that category. <br /> <br />I certainly found the book and Rand's philosophy interesting.  The book is about 700 pages of character development.  Personally, I think Rand could have written 400 pages and still been as effective at explaining her philosophy.  Roark (the main Objective?) and the other main characters are meant to represent extremes and are therefore not particularly likable.  The story moves quickly and has some interesting, unexpected twists.  <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend reading this book.  I wasn't stunned by the philosophy but it's worth the read.
B00006RINF|5.0|buy this album you will not be disapointed ...... from beginning to end  absolutely marvelous
B000683VI4|5.0|When I went to the movies to see The Notebook with my fiance, I was impressed. By the end of the movie there wasn't a dry eye in the theater(even the guys). I don't mind watching chick flicks with my fiance and this one really got me. I mean, I don't cry during movies but this one was an exception. Guys...if you watch chick flicks with your woman, I believe you would like this one. Besides the sex scene was very passionate and hot. Who knows what might happen after you watch the movie with your woman ;). This is defintely a movie to add to any movie collectors selection. I know cause I'm adding it to mine and I'm a guy.
B00006IX0R|5.0|I normally listen to country or rock oldies, but once in a while I hear this beautiful song on someones radio who's listening a POP station. Who sings it or What is the song title, I kept asking my self. I would listen for the end of the song and hope the DJ would tell me, but they just never would. Until just a few days ago, when finnaly I learn that beautiful song that has been haunting me for a long time is \\"DREAMS\\".  Now it's Mine.  <br /> <br />I love the rest of the CD as well except for just one song, but hey that's what a track forward button is for.
1591840562|5.0|I have just completed Guy Kawasaki's, \\"The Art of the Start\\" and found the material very useful.  Guy's style is easy to follow, straight-shooting, and actionable.  I have dog-eared at least 20 pages for future reference, which is about four times the amount of other books I've read. <br /> <br />Although I'm in the early stages of raising capital, I've learned a lot regarding the \\"pitch\\" and the art of branding.  I loved Guy's thoughts on getting a Morpheous and his insight regarding \\"telling new lies.\\" <br /> <br />This is a great guide for those serious about moving forward with their passion for making a difference.
0393317552|1.0|Had this garbage been written by Jesse Jackson himself, it could not contain more easily disproven racist propaganda.  Diamond's primary contention is that white people and western society have gained cultural and social dominance not as a result of any will or abilities of their own, but as a by product of how many domesticable animals and the variety of plant life that make up  their environment. While other less fortunate societies didn't have these \\"luxuries\\" to take advantage of. Uh, excuse me, it doesn't take a genius to realize the botanical and zoological superiority of Africa for example.  Off the top of my head, I can list several potentially demosticle species of large animals in Africa, Asia and Australia.  How many can you think of in Europe?  The really sad thing is, judging by its popularity and years on the bestseller lists, people are eating this stuff up.  This guy obviously hates himself or has spent a little too much time in that New Guinea sun.  This type of, I hate to say it, liberal drivel is sickening.  There are explanations out there for why western society dominates that actually make sense.  Guns, Germs, and Steel isn't one of them.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I work at blockbuster so I just got the movie in today,  Good look to the dvd I only wish their was more in it, all their is, is a few trailers and a sneak peak of the making of saw, also a music video.  I was kinda hoping that we'd be able to see the uncut version of the movie.  I don't know tho the movie is great tho perfect choice  great thriller for the remotely intelligent people.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Allright!! I've heard the samples but this is the disc I highly reccomend!! I just ordered this disc but I need it!!!
1400034779|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! It was touching, warm and kept you interested in the fate of each character. Its a perfect Sunday afternoon read.
0671027344|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower was a good book.  I'm almost sure that it is because that everything that charlie went through was so easy to relate to.  The book is about exactly what goes on in high school and what goes on between high school age students.  The drugs, the sex, the alcohol, the parties, the secrets the mistakes that teenagers make, etc.  High school is all about learning and that is what charlie is doing.  All of his friends are seniors, so they are more experienced then he is and are into different things then he is.  He just pretty much goes along for the ride.  His two best friends who are brother and sister, Patrick and Sam, accept charlie and bring him into a whole new world.  Charlie has a crush on sam as well, which works out in a strange way.  This book has its up and downs, at times you laugh with the book and what is going on and other times you cry and just wonder why this has to happen like this.  Almost every thing a teenager has to deal with is included in the novel. Stephen Chbosky is a gifted writer.  The way that the nevoel is set up also adds to its greatness.  The novel is set up as letters to an undisclosed person, and the letters are mailed with out a return address, and with the names of the people in the letter changed so that Charlie could not be pinpointed and also to protect the secrets that he kept for his friends but included in the letters.  This book is absolutely not just for teenagers but also for parents.  I can not even find the words to say how great this book really is.  I am not an emotional person but I could not help but to let them show for this book.
0670033375|5.0|&#65279;I&#8217;m driven to write a review of this book in response to a couple of reviews who seem to have their knickers in a twist. :) <br />(Note: key words are &#8220; bigoted white haters&#8221; or &#8220;Academia-trash&#8221;) <br />Notice that nowhere  is anything of substance *in the book* they are supposed to be reviewing addressed.  <br /> <br />I would like to point out a readily accessible source that can be used to evaluate the thesis proposed in &#8220;Collapse&#8221;., that environmental collapse is related to the collapse of societies. <br /> <br /> The Icelandic Free State is an almost perfect society to evaluate this hypothesis. We know when the society was founded, have written records covering almost the entire period and it&#8217;s isolated from European culture for all practical purposes. Read &#8220;Collapse&#8221;, then read about the Free State.  Look at how Icelandic society and economy changed according to changes in natural resources.   The question is not whether the reader *likes* the results, but do observations match the hypothesis.  The hypothesis (very generally speaking) is that environmental  <br />collapse leads to societal collapse.  The book then presents observations to support that thesis. There are nearly always problems when trying to write a popular book covering such a broad and complicated thesis. <br /> <br /> The reader doesn&#8217;t have to believe me or the author or any reviewer.  The data is public record for the most part, available at any public or university library.  <br /> <br />While I may disagree with some of the details, overall I agree with the thesis.  Environmental collapse leads to societal collapse.  Which is neither a pro environmental nor anti business stance.  Frankly, both sides of that argument are mush-for-brains.  For years &#8220;business&#8221; fought the introduction of &#8216;environmentally friendly cleaners&#8217; to replace the old petrochemical cleaners. After they were forced to accept them . . .they found the new cleaners were cheaper, better and easier to use. And workers didn&#8217;t get sick using them.  Productivity and profits went up.  <br /> <br />OTOH, some rabid environmentalists seem to feel that business is their natural enemy, without realizing that a subsistence society has neither the leisure nor the free capital to *think* about the environment, let alone  work to preserve it. If it&#8217;s a choice between starving or eating the last great auk . . . Only rich societies can afford to worry about the environment. <br />  <br />Read the book, do the research make up your own mind.
B000002H1T|5.0|I saw the Cars in concert in 1984 and was very impressed with their <br />music.This album was a commercial success and a highlight of MTV <br />at that period in music. This music is instantly recognized as 1980's music. I still think this album is a great one and wonder why The Car's have not been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
B000683VI4|1.0|A word and a warning to writers everywhere: Don't have your two primary characters literally lie down and die together unless your name is William Shakespeare. That technique simply doesn't work for lesser talents. I have rarely witnessed such a maudlin, dismal display. If there were an Oscar category for \\"most depressing,\\" this juvenile, completely implausible exercise in tedium would be a shoo-in.
0380002930|5.0|This is truly one the greatest books of our time. The characters are deep and you care for them, and anyone who has heard of this book has to mention the hero: Hazel. He is one of the greatest characters I have ever read and a wonderful leader for this group of rabbits. This book is not necessarily an \\"easy\\" read but one you will have great satisfaction from. The ending you will leave you with tears in your eyes. Out of all the books you have ever read, you will remember this one.
B0006B2A42|4.0|I would rate this movie as 3.75 on the five star system. I found Ice Station Zebra to be quite an interesting and entertaining movie. A great cast led by Rock Hudson proves to be superb and fun to watch. The movie was adapted from the Alistair MacLean's novel. Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare were both taken from MacLean's novels and both were great movies.<br /><br />The Cold War situation really don't looked that dated to me. Its part of history. The script is well written and although the special effects on ice and snow appears to be bit cheesy by today's standards, it doesn't take away from gripping story about espionage, betrayal and secret microfilm. The photography was superbly done, even on the cheesy ice and snow area. Personally, I didn't see anything wrong with Ernest Borgnine playing a Russian, If Sean Connery can, why not him? I felt sorry for Jim Brown again, cutting a promising football career only to be killed off in movies. Patrick McGoohan was great and he and Hudson carried the load of the film.<br /><br />The film became infamous when it was learned that it was Howard Hughes' favorite movie of all times but that shouldn't distract from the fact that its a pretty decent film. Its on my guilty pleasure list of films I like despite of some flaws. What some flaws? Well, the movie more closer to a drama, not action adventure as some folks may have thought. When I first saw this movie at the age of ten, even I could figured out that Ernest Borgnine may end up being a the bad guy. It was bit obvious. The ice and snow set were really pretty lame but it can be overlook. And for some of you guys out there, there is no female in this movie!! (All male cast.)<br /><br />The DVD edition of this film proves to be quite good. The images are clear and crisp, the 5.1 DD works pretty decently although not very aggressively. There is a short documentary on the film and some trailers to watch. Definitely not much on the extras.
B00068IOWM|1.0|This mistake is extremely boring and meaningless. Bono is extremely annoying here, unlistenable. This album is the perfect example of how... can save a music lover fromwasting money on over-rated trash.  <br /> <br />This sellout U2 doesn't deserve the colossal amount of hype it has been getting. Anyone who would call \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It\\" a 'deep song' has absolutely no credibility to judge music... it's probably the most clich U2 song ever, possibly tied with \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Crumbs For Your Table\\". What horrible pick for a band's second single!. If you want to listen to a brilliant song related to a father's death, listen to Pink Floyd \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\" instead. Video Clip is even worse and more clich, with all those silly shots at the Opera theatre.  <br /> <br />They've somehow menaced their way onto the charts and remained, selling their faceless wan. They music sounds so plastic, unimpressive, worthless and commercial that gives me urge to go to the first restroom out there, really. Incredibly unoriginal and predictable, this is the worst U2 album, and the most overhyped as well. All songs sound too similar ( by the way, the whole same ATYCLB sound ). Not even decent songwriting, this soup is just low quality pap for the bucks.  <br /> <br />U2 have become no more than a mainstream music corporation. I can't believe these are the same men whom used to take white flags to their early concerts. Yet some stupid fans say this half-worked Ipod product is a 'return to their roots'. I bet you young Bono would hate this sellout faceless Ipod man.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Not since Thin Lizzy's Jail Brake (no they don't sound like Thin Lizzy) has a band taken the essential elements of rock and both created rock anew, as well as, in the most pure fashion rocked the way it should. Fun, Fast, Driving, Rough, Tough, Funny, Smart Solid Short Songs.  And for those who know it will remind of the California Desert as it feels in the gut. <br /> <br />For those who have been brainwashed and beaten by pop music's definition of rock, punk, country and metal over the past decade this is not the album for you. Those who remember how to consume with out a dissolvable capsule coating over media conglomerate approved songs than buy this one, you will never regret popping it in.
B000683VI4|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a successful novelist because he writes books that are accessible, flagrantly romantic, populated with characters that no matter how obvious their motivations and feelings manage to capture the imagination of readers in a world lacking beauty at this point in time.  And so it was inevitable that THE NOTEBOOK become a popular film: it serves a need to audiences beleaguered by horror/fright films, toilet humor teenage movies, and combustible highly flammable action flicks.<br /><br />Briefly (because the amount of story in this film IS brief) THE NOTEBOOK is a story read to an Alzheimer victim (Gena Rowlands) in an extended care facility by a live-in 'Duke' (James Garner) who is attempting to aid the old lady's memory. The notebook is a diary kept by the lady (this is not a spoiler - the fact is made clear too early in the film) of the first love of a wealthy 17-year-old Allison (Rachel McAdams) and a lumberyard heart-of-gold without an education poor bloke Noah (Ryan Gosling).  Allison's wealthy parents (Joan Allen and David Thornton) deny their daughter's feelings and separate her from Noah.  Noah goes to war (this is the 1940's by the way) having written to Allison 365 letters never answered because Allison's overprotective mother does not deliver them.<br /><br />Time passes, Noah returns home from the war, concentrates on rebuilding the old plantation dream house that was the site of his blooming love for Allison seven years ago. In the meantime Allison, thinking that Noah had forgotten her, falls in love with a satisfactory young wealthy man (James Marsden) and before marrying him, discovers Noah's return, goes out to meet him at the dream house, and well, the rest is pretty obvious.<br /><br />The nice thing about this little movie is the commitment on the part of the actors: they are all excellent and make this otherwise passable summer movie something better than the book.  No one is to blame for the predictability of the plot except for Nicholas Sparks, and he continues to churn out these weepies to a needy audience.  And that is very okay!

B00005JMJ4|2.0|Watching this movie you can't help but feel lost in the translation.  The best part of the movie is Bill Murray's acting, the cultural faux paus, and the fabulous location. The worst part is that this movie has no point, a sorry excuse for an ending, and a big huh!What's the big deal! feeling.  The critcs seem to love this movie but I don't think the viewers feel the same way. I can't imagine buying this movie and watching it again. But then again, I value my money and time!
0765309408|5.0|Good science fiction has the capacity to literally transport you forward in time -- and yes, I use the word \\"literally\\" literally. Simply pick up a book like Old Man's War, and the next thing you know, you'll be several hours into the future without any sensation of the passage of time. <br /> <br />Scalzi has clearly been influence by Heinlein, and acknowledges as such on the book's final page. I've loved Heinlein since my father gave me a copy of _Door_Into_Summer_ when I was a wee lad, and I've always felt rather sad that there will be no new stories from him. John Scalzi aspires to be his successor, and with _Old_Man's_War_ he's off to a great start. The book is at turns enthralling, suspenseful, wistful, and hilariously funny. (If the protagonist's first encounter with his drill instructor doesn't have you laughing out loud, your sense of humor has been surgically removed.) The level of science is just about right; futuristic without much straining credibility. The only downside, which this book shares with every other quality book of its type, is that the ride is over all too soon and you're left aching for more. <br /> <br />I certainly hope Scalzi is hard at work on his sophomore piece. If he manages to keep it up, he has the potential to enter the canon.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is a testament to the fact that true love outlasts everything life can throw at it! Supberb cast.  Supberb screenplay.  In my opinion, better than the book bearing the same name, no offense to Nicholas Sparks's work.  Just a warning: Men may call this movie a chick flick but believe me none of them can say it's not one of the best romantic movies they have seen  in a real long time.  P.S. Don't forget to bring tissues! WHAT! Movie reviewers cry too! I am not the only one! I am not! Check out the other reviewers.  Go ahead!
1400032717|3.0|I give it 3.5 stars because it was interesting to see inside Christopher's daily life as an autistic person. I felt the story was too harsh and while it was good written from his perspective, it lacked in a softness that the plot needed considering the situation.<br /><br />Christopher is a teenager with 'special needs'; he goes to a special school where he excels. His parents have their own battles and his mother dies but a twist encounters the reader regarding this part.<br /><br />It was fascinating in parts, again dealing with autism, but the plot was not as good as I'd assume given the marketing hype over the book.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|I have no stomach for horror movies, but I do love a good spoof.  This is much different from Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness where the evil dead things do funny stuff.  The only funny character in this movie is Shaun, and the reason he is funny is because he is reacting to being stuck in genuine horror movie.  Brilliantly written.
B000286RKW|5.0|An absolutely great film with absolutely great acting and the stunning realization that everybody loses, for all their bravado and all the big bucks that flowed thru their hands, the 'goodfellas' and their families lose in the end. An overlooked cameo in this film is the portrayal of the wives of the mobster-goodfellas - shallow, crude,gaudily made-up and dressed..the wondrous Lorraine Bracco excepted (her character is Jewish). Almost an insult to ltalian-American women, but we have to keep in mind that the film portrays a very small percentage of them. <br /> <br />And now the \\"but\\": as cited by movie critics, the 'f' word is used at least 199 times in this film and, even tho this is the way the mobsters talked,it can become tedious and a strain on the sensibilities, so be prepared. Me? l'm hardly a prude and  l'd love to see it again, but the constant use of the 'f' word was a turn-off for me, it being both used and abused brutally in this otherwise-marvelous film. One viewing was enough for me, and, admittedly, it's my loss.
B000641Z90|5.0|I saw Phil on this tour in Orlando, he was outstanding then, and this DVD shows the true experience of his First Farewell Tour. Its hard to imagine a world without Phil Collins, but this DVD will provide a lasting experience of a lifetime
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Loved the book.  I got the unabridged audio tapes and listened to it before seeing the movie on DVD.<br /><br />Gruesome and violent, it definately makes you hate some of the characters but does very little to endear you to the main characters of the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately in the movie the love story was just about non-existant.  A glimpse, a stolen moment and a glass of water does not equal the epic love story of all ages.<br /><br />The scenery of the movie was excellent and really is what saved this movie from being 1 or 2 stars.  If they could have given an oscar for best actor to the background, this should have been nominated.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie you go see if you liked the horse whisperer or brave heart and you thought to yourself \\"I'd love to go see where they shot that film!\\"
0385510454|4.0|Once again, Amazon's rating system has forced me to give this a slightly higher rating that I would like; if I could, I'd subtract half a star for reasons I'll get to in a moment.   <br /> <br />  \\"The Broker\\" is fairly typical Grisham; he creates some interesting characters (including one introduced in an earlier novel), he sets up a believable and intriguing scenario, he introduces some local color (Italy instead of Mississippi) and he can't figure out how to end it.  Grisham's weakness has always been his inability to bring a story to a satisfying conclusion; while some of his books fare better in this respect than others, as a general rule his endings are either unbelievable or, more often, cursory.  It appears that at times he sets up a situation that he can't figure out how to get out of so he just walks away from it.  I have never felt that as strongly as I did with \\"The Broker.\\" <br /> <br />Grisham clearly can write well.  But here he goes to great lengths to put his protagonist, Joel Backman, in a difficult position.  It's hard to describe what happens without giving too much away but those who read the dust jacket know that Backman is in Italy and his life is in danger.  Grisham spends much time introducing characters who represent a threat and describing the various gadgets they have at their disposal to ensure their success.  But, again without saying too much, it all really doesn't matter.  In most cases, Grisham shrugs off the situations he has created and you get the feeling of \\"so what.\\" <br /> <br />I wanted to like this book more than I did.  It's fast-paced and I learned a lot about Bologna, Italy. But when I finished, I felt cheated.  And that's why I think four stars is a little generous.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|The film is a CGI smorgasbord version of the old Universal features like Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman;<br /><br />The plots lameness is exceeded only by the miserable acting, as it was extremely tough for me to \\"suspend belief\\" and get into the story.  A monster killed who has no memory set out to kill Dracula in Transylvania. But this is not a movie that was put out so we could measure it for credibility: it is two hours of entertainment: it is a movie that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment. It is not meant to be a classic horror tale nor a comic book, but instead something you can forget after 2 hours of wasted time.<br /><br />Van Helsing is the Indiana Jones of the church, with a mission is to capture monsters.  How far can you go with a plot like that?  About 2 hours.
B000068QZK|1.0|His first four solo albums, two with randy rhoads, and two with jake e lee took heavy metal to a new uplifting level, with such superb tracks as bark at the moon, rock and roll rebel, mr crowley, flying high again, ultimate sin, and shot in the dark just to name a few of the better tracks.  i was never one whom got a liking to zakk's playing.  I am still from the older school where randy and jake's playing had flair (flare).  it seems as though ozzman's magic that he had with randy and jake seemed to have snuck out the back door, or in through the outdoor.  compare his live performaces from ultimate ozzy and live at budokan is about as different as night and day.  in live at budokan, the stomping, the wooo let me see your cigarette lighters are gone, and just a man standing. His vocal is superb as ever, but the stage presence is gone, just as the musical presence is absent from this album.  my recommendation is listen to ozzy's older solo from blizzard of ozz to ultimate sin, and tribute.  skip the rest, and just listen to the old sabbath stuff.
0812550706|3.0|Die hard SCI-FI fans are going to be disappointed with this book because it's not about science fiction or fantasy.  It's about relationships and a comming of age.  This could easily have been set in medieval times, in an orphanage, in present day, or any other time period or place you can think of.<br /><br />The book is a good read, the same way that Harry Potter is a good read.  Yes it is entertaining but does not scratch the surface to immerse you in the setting.  For those of you who truly enjoy that sort of thing, I would recomend Dragon's Egg.<br /><br />OSC is one of my favorite authors because he does use relationships in his stories, I was just disapointed with this because his jaunt into sci-fi made it so obvious that he really should stay on the fantasy side with his Alvin Maker series.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I saw this movie in its theatrical release and I just finished watching it again on DVD. It's as if writer/director Kerry Conran and his brother Kevin reached inside of every 12 year old boy living in the first half of the 20th century and projected their collective imaginations onto the screen. Fighter planes and dirigibles, robots and ray-guns, dashing heroes and dazzling heroines-this movie has it all. The movie is set in 1939 and the commentary indicates that this is an homage to the 1939 New York World's Fair \\"Building the World of Tomorrow\\" and its theme that technology was on the verge of bringing about a better world. This movie is also an attempt to pay homage to all the old science fiction and adventure books, comics, and serials of the 30's and 40's while breaking new ground in filmaking techniques. The movie received overwhelmingly positive reviews based on its look but the area that some critics found lacking was in the story. I feel like the film succeeds in both areas. <br /> <br />The film is beautiful to look at and, although not as awe-inspiring on the small screen as it was on the big screen, it remains a sight to behold. The Conran brothers and company crafted a movie that hearkens back to the early days of filmmaking while infusing it with rich color and depth that has to be seen to be believed. It is really unfair to attempt to describe this movie's look in words as it is in the viewing that one can truly appreciate what they've done. It only adds to the wonder knowing that this was Kerry Conran's first film.  <br /> <br />The story is just what I expected it to be before I ever saw the film. It was written to honor classic science fiction and adventure stories and the characterization is dead on. The hero is herioc, the heroine is beautiful and resourceful, and the bad guys are bad guys. Simple? Yes, but exactly the right tone for the movie they set out to make. This movie has a good blend of action, humor, and romance that keeps the story progressing at a very entertaining pace. The producer really managed to hit it big with the casting of this movie as well. Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi are perfect in their respective roles and a posthumous performance by Sir Laurence Olivier is icing on the cake. Repeated viewings are enjoyable if only to attempt to identify all the little references to other films, etc. Fans of the genre will recognize the nod to Star Wars Phantom Menace as well as visual references to Atlantis, The Island of Dr. Moreau, At the Earth's Core, etc but the movie is chock full of harder to find items. The `making of' feature points out the silhouette of King Kong on the Empire State Building in one shot and my wife pointed out the silhouette of Godzilla in the Tokyo newspaper after the first robot attack. <br /> <br />Technically the DVD is great. The sound and picture quality were very good, especially when utilizing a surround sound system. And speaking of sound, the music in this movie is appropriately heroic and the sound effects, from the machine gun fire to the old fashioned robot laser sounds, are just phenomenal. I had been hoping for some creative packaging given the unique creativity of the movie but it is your typical plastic package with nary a slip of paper inside. The 2-part making-of feature was very entertaining as was a gag real with real and computer generated bloopers. 2 deleted scenes were interesting only in that it showed alternate ways in these 2 incidents that the story could have been advanced. I listened to a portion of the producer's commentary and the writer/director's commentary. While they both sound like they would be interesting to listen to I was disappointed in that I had hoped they would go in and point out all the little inside jokes and references that are obviously littered throughout the movie. Ah well, maybe in a director's cut.  <br /> <br />If you are a fan of this genre or if you just like fun, well-done escapistfilms then you owe it to yourself to check this out. <br /> <br />
B0006IIKS0|5.0|It doesn't take a fan to appreciate this movie.  Rich and famous people have problems just like you and me.  They may have it made but they are human also.  The Mighty Metallica is not just a machine, it is comprised of men. It has tons of extras to boot!
0156027321|4.0|When choosing books I oftentimes pick up finalists or semi-finalists that made BookSense Books of the Year (found on [...]) because I am rarely disappointed with those picks.  This time I have to admit I was just a little disappointed.  Yann Martel is obviously a very talented writer and he created an interesting fable full of symbolism.  This book would probably make a great book-club book with many discussion topics and much interaction.  I appreciated his excellent writing style, but was disappointed with the lack of color and action.  Most of this story occurs in a little life boat between a boy and a tiger, and I hate to admit it but it was dull.  The reason I gave this book four stars (instead of three) is because I appreciated Martel's complex writing style, but I kept wanting to put this book down for something more entertaining.<br /><br />Your own litmus test:  How did you like The Old Man and the Sea?  If you loved it then you'll probably enjoy this book.  If you knew it was a great piece of literature but had to force yourself to keep turning the pages (like me) then you'll probably feel the same about Life of Pi.
B000002U82|5.0|I can't believe how long it took me to finally get this album. But after hearing it constantly heralded as the greatest record ever made, I felt it my duty as a music lover to buy it. <br />All in all, I think it's a splendid progressive rock offering, but far from the best or most innovative/influential thing out there. \\"On The Run\\" is almost exactly what Tangerine Dream was doing at the same time, and many other, lesser known bands had already been exploring these same types of areas for years. Check out \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" by King Crimson for some great early prog. <br />But innovation aside, there's some great stuff here. \\"Breathe\\" is a great psychodelic track, and while not of my favorites on the album, does a good job of setting the mood for the piece. \\"Time\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\" are both stellar examples of everything a good prog song should be. Good lyrics, great musicianship and some killer hooks. \\"Money\\", which seems to polarize fans between love and hate, I find quite good, though not on par with the tracks mentioned earlier. Many people here have described \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" as a woman \\"screaming\\" for five minutes. It's not screaming, it's a vocal solo. You know how you have a guitar solo? Well this is a vocal solo. It's not really that uncommon. <br />Finally in response to all the one star reviews: What's wrong with you people? If you don't like this, fine. That's your opinion. But I can't believe you're so narrow minded that you think anything instrumental is \\"boring\\" or \\"pointless\\". One guy even complained that you can't dance to this. Is that really the only reason you listen to music, to dance? I encourage you all to break out of your top 40 prisons and try something different. You might expand your mind, who knows?
1400032717|5.0|This book is a very good read, and it is very enlightening on the world of an autistic child.  I knew only a little about what it means to be autistic and it was definitely an eye opener to view this mindset.  I feel that this story is more like a story within a story- you read about the thoughts and actions of this autistic boy, but soon see through the boy's words and realize the adult reality of what he does not comprehend.  I enjoyed Haddon's writing style very much and I definitely recommend this book to others.  This book is NOT what I term \\"brain candy.\\"  It is a solid piece of well-written fiction.
0060512806|4.0|I was excited to pick up this book because it was on a subject right up my alley - encryption.  Throw in the fact that it has a lot of WWII action in there and I was sure it was a winner.<br /><br />The book is a winner in many respects but I found myself wanting to read more about the WWII characters than the modern ones.  The story jumps around a lot, back to WWII and to the modern age with the common thread of encryption saving the world (in WWII) and conquering the world, at least fiscally, in the modern day.<br /><br />I thought the actions and theory behind the modern part of the story were a bit of a stretch.  Yes, this is a work of fiction, but I like my fiction to be believable!  Stephenson goes into a bit of economic theory to support how his modern concept could work (don't want to spoil anything), but I just didn't buy it.<br /><br />Maybe that's where Stephenson went wrong for me.  This is a huge book - well over 1000 pages, but the story winds and wanders all over the place going in detail into encryption theory, economic theory, theoretical math - great stuff for a geek like me but it was tough to stick to a story line when all this subjects had to be explained.  Perhaps the author should have assumed his reader was a bit more intelligent and then he wouldn't have had to delve into all these explanations.<br /><br />Still, I give the book 4 out of 5 stars.  It was a pretty good book, pretty overwhelming too - but that can be a good thing.
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is perhaps the most classic classic movie of all time.  Even after more than 60 years it still entertains well.<br /><br />The dialog is excellent ... just a lot of wonderful lines.  My favorites are:<br /><br />Ugarte: You despise me don't you?<br />Rick: If I ever gave you a thought, I probably would.<br /><br />Rick: I don't buy or sell human beings.<br />Ferrari: That's a pity. It is Casablanca's leading commodity.<br /><br />Renault: (to Rick) I've often speculated on why you can't return to America ... I like to think you killed a man ... it's the romantic in me.<br /><br />Renault: What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?<br />Rick: My health ... I came to Casablanca for the waters.<br />Renault: The waters?  What waters?  We're in a desert.<br />Rick: I was misinformed.<br /><br />Strasser: Can you see us (invading) New York?<br />Rick: Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.<br /><br />Ferrari: As the leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca ... I'm an influencial and respected man.<br /><br />Rick: You can tell me now ... I'm reasonably sober.<br /><br />Rick: (to Ilsa) I wouldn't bring up Paris now if I were you ... it's bad salesmanship.<br />Ilsa: (Threatens to shoot Rick)<br />Rick: Go ahead and shoot.  You'll be doing me a favor.<br /><br />Ilsa: You have to do the thinking for both of us; for all of us.<br />Rick: All right ... I will.<br /><br />Renault: Ricky, I'm going to miss you.  Apparently you are the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I do.<br /><br />Rick: Louie ... I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.<br /><br />But the acting here is top-notch.  Normally, a movie back then had top-shelf talent for 3, maybe 4 of the leading roles.  In Casablanca, quality actors are used 9 or 10 roles deep into the cast.<br /><br />The background music (provided by Max Steiner) is excellent. Often, after a movie has been around for many years, the music will seem stale or out of place ... but here it is as fresh and well-blended with the action as the day the movie was released.  There is, however, the nasty item on Mr. Steiner ... that, when he began his work to provide the background music (after the filming had been completed) he actually wanted to replace the song \\"As Time Goes By\\" in the film with a song he himself wrote ... to gain the royalties for he himself ... but, as Ingrid Bergman had already cut her hair (for her next film \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\") it was impossible to reshoot all the scenes in which \\"As Time Goes By\\" is played by Dooley Wilson ... and so he (Steiner) had to ... acquiesce.<br /><br />The spotlight is pretty bright on Bogie and Ingrid though ... especially after 60 years of close scrutiny.  Bogie does some excellent work here, and he carries the lead very well, but there are flaws in his performance, and they seem to stand out.  Ingrid's performance is solid, but there again, there are moments in her performance that I am sure she later wished she could have redone.<br /><br />Conrad Veidt is excellent as the bad guy ... just a great great job at being menacing.  Claude Rains perhaps had the most fun lines to speak, and he seems to have had fun saying them.  Sydney Greenstreet is very excellent as Ferrari, and Peter Lorre is good also.  S.Z. Sakall is delightful as the waiter Carl ... and is a very natural actor, I think.<br /><br />Paul Henreid (as Victor Lazlo) is OK.  I read that, before he agreed to do the movie, he negotiated his billing to be up with Bogie's and Ingrid's.  Did he deserve it?  I'm not sure.  Of all the film's performances, his seems to come across to the audience with the least effectiveness.  He doesn't strike us as a great leader of a movement or as a patriot on the run.  Nor does he seem to be the type of man that would inspire Ilsa's love.  And so, it's hard to root for him.  But maybe this helped the picture in a way ... in that it does allowus to root all the more for Rick and Ingrid to be together.  But it's hard to put Paul Henreid up in the same categorie (acting-wise) as Bogie and Ingrid.<br /><br />But, being the critic here, there are some unrealistic aspects to the plot I'd like to point out:<br /><br />- When Ugarte is arrested (and later interrogated) he definately would have told the Nazis that Rick had the exit visas ... especially after Rick refused to  \\"... stick his neck out for anybody.\\"<br /><br />- The Nazis, upon learning that Victor Lazlo was at Rick's Cafe, would have immediately arrested him, then killed him.  Definitely.<br /><br />- And Lazlo would never have travelled under his real name, nor would he have allowed it to be spoken aloud in a crowded restaurant.<br /><br />- Rick's bravado toward the Nazis (mostly in the flash-back scene) would never be.  It would have been foolhardy not to acknowledge the very real (and scary) threat they posed.<br /><br />- And when Rick lets that honest young man win at gambling, so he and his wife could afford the bribe to Captain Renault, he (Rick) is lauded for it.  But, no thought is given to the (certain) hundreds of times Rick used the same trick to cheat honest people out of their money.<br /><br />Like I said ... just being the critic.<br /><br />But it is a very watchable movie ... with no dull moments at all.<br /><br />FOR THE 50th RE-ISSUE:<br /><br />The \\"Making of ...\\" addition to the 50th anniversary re-issue of Casablanca gives us some interesting tid-bits, but is a weak effort.<br /><br />They follow a standard format: Interview the guy who wrote the play, the lady who discovered the play, Ingrid's daughter, the lighting guy, have Bogie's wife narrate it, and so on ... but there's too much pap and not enough pith.<br /><br />... and no gossip!

B00005ALRO|5.0|The Fugitive, 1994 film<br /><br />The film opens with a woman being attacked; it is the wife of Dr. Richard Kimble. The police take the husband in for questioning. They had been at an event, and Dr. Kimble was called to the hospital, leaving his wife alone. There was an attack by a one-armed man; his wife’s death leaves him rich. Dr. Kimble is convicted for her murder and sentenced to death. (This is based on the 1960s TV series.) The surprise in this movie is not in the ending, but the events that lead to the ending. The legend of a surgeon wrongly convicted is based on the real case of Dr. Sam Sheppard. As an action suspense story, this is excellent! [It is set in the Chicago area, perhaps because Cleveland would have no part of this story.]<br /><br />Deputy Marshal Gerard shows up to personally take over the investigation, and search for the fugitive. Dr. Kimble’s escape in cold weather reminds me of the similar escape of Rambo. Dr. Kimble hides in the urban jungle. The pacing keeps the fugitive one jump ahead of his pursuers. When he is trapped in the tunnel, Dr. Kimble goes underground (literally). Gerard is relentless for a man who “doesn’t care”. Dr. Kimble escapes with a desperate leap into the air. We then follow Dr. Kimble as he attempts to search for the real killer, like in a detective story. There is exciting action until the final minutes when Justice triumphs.<br /><br />This story was updated to reflect the business world of the 1990s, and its many scandals. Professional rivalry could not be mentioned in the 1960s (between Cleveland General Hospital and the small clinic owned by the Sheppard family). This is a film that can be watched and enjoyed every year. I wonder if that ethnic neighborhood was chosen for some significance? The parade in the street reminded me of the scene in “Blow Out” or “The Net”. The film does not tell of Dr. Kimble’s future. Will Dr. Kimble face the same problems that Dr. Sheppard faced after his acquittal? We hope not. Itwill take another court case to reverse the first verdict.<br /><br />The real story of Dr. Sam Sheppard is better than any movie or novel. F. Lee Bailey said anyone who is a suspect should immediately get the best defense lawyer around. Would a pharmaceutical company take such desperate action to hide the bad effects of its proprietary medicine? It would be liable for millions for producing a harmful medication. All medicines have side effects, that is why they are controlled substances. Is there any independent testing of a new medication? What is the FDA’s policy. After this watch “Wrongfully Accused”, a parody of this story.
034547581X|5.0|I saw the movie &amp; thought I would give the book a whirl.  This book is extremely well written &amp; frighteningly real.  It not only looks at this infamous battle in extaordinary detail but gives the reader an idea of what went on &quot;back home&quot; perhaps from the perspective of the families of the soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965.  Also included is a small glimpse of some of the political decisions that were made at the time &amp; the consequences of those decisions.  This is an excellent read.  UNPUTDOWNABLE
B000003TB6|5.0|This is my favorite Roots album, despite the fact that seemingly everyone in the universe worships Things Fall Apart, which is also a very good album. But on Do You Want More, The Roots create a chill out jazzy vibe that I have never been able to find again on any other hip-hop album. This album is a great listen, either on your headphones or as background music in your living room. I just wish The Roots would drop the guitars and go back to the jazzy beats full time. Of course, they probably wouldn't have as many MTV videos if they did that, so hey, do your thing.
B0001RVQM8|5.0|I didn't find any interpretive problems here with the Appassionata, yes the pacing, the momentum tells the entire story in Beethoven, for he was a purveyor of music materials, scales, figures melodic, shapes, thrusts, chord progressions, developmental schemes, variations,all to be manipulated,truncated; he never wrote what you might say is a \\"beautiful\\" melody, he was far smarter than that, and interested in music's other parameters. Biss here keeps, maintains this momentum (the First movement)and again you must listen for the larger sweeps of phrases not from moment to moment, for that could be fine, but the larger phrases need to be correct, to be rhythmically on the mark,something Leonard Meyer referred to as the architetonic dimension of pulse and rhythmThe last movement tells the entire story, here if you begin it too, fast, you had better run, hide someplace, for F minor will be a key that will never forgive you.Biss understands this here whether intellectually or intuitively he has it. There was some nice moments in the Beethoven you feel that he wants to push it at times but that only leads to a dangerous abyss. No he doesn't have the mature vision of Rubenstein or Richter but he's there pitching with them noentheless.<br /><br />This is the best Schumann I've heard in a while, incredibly lyrical,like Biss is playing the \\"pop\\" tunes of the day. He has a wonderful sense of melodic direction, knows where things are going, a phrase, and knows what such a melody might do to one, he nurtures this quite well.Biss seems to understand the points in Schumann that could be boring,like his mundane accompanimental figures, or the obvious chordal fills, you must nurture these as well, for chordal display is important in Schumann. He is difficult to interpret, like Haydn, there is no \\"kugles\\" manufactures for each of them,so it is music you must work at. Schumann can be difficult unless you do emotion \\"root canal\\" work as Michelangeli sometimes, exploring the extremes of Schumann's aesthetic, like he was a mad man, well mad men make incredible music we know, and isn't hte transgressive, the irrational an important part in dealing with the romantic credos. Schumann saved Romanticism from the tyranny of Beethoven's symphonic revolution, he saved it with the private, introspective, parochial lifeworlds to explore. Likewise Biss's \\"Fantasy in G Minor\\" of Ludwig has the same discipline required, impassioned but not overly so.<br /><br />There is another recording I beleive of Biss playing the Appasionata, for I heard even more balance and numance in that one.of Schumann's aesthetic, like he was a mad man, well mad men make incredible music we know, and isn't hte transgressive, the irrational an important part in dealing with the romantic credos.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I have read many reviews for and against this release.  I think in general they are accurate but written with the wrong attitude.  I think I speak for a large consumer population when I say that we are not disappointed with the new editions.  We are only disappointed that the original release is not available as well.  I don't mind the butchered version of the film so long as it isn't released at the expense of the original, which it has been.  This has nothing to do with Star Wars fanatics or spineless reviews defending Lucas.  It has to do with the simple fact that I and those out there like myself cannot take our VHS copies and stick them into our DVD player and watch the classic films on our DLP screens.  We've been robbed of our original purchase by Time.  Well, it's our own faults for purchasing these releases.  They are well aware that if they release the original version on DVD that they will not collect the market for these pathetic revised editions.  They will give the people what they want.  Tell them what you want and accept no less.  I am not about to put another Ferrari in someone's garage that they haven't earned.  Don't buy this copy.  It's not worth it.  It's not Star Wars.  Purchasing it will only further the delay with this film as with others.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Much as I try to avoid injecting personal anecdotes into my reviews, I feel one is necessary in this case.  Anyway, a couple days ago, during one of my interminable drives home from work, I was listening to the Afghan Whigs' album Black Love and trying to figure out exactly why I liked it so much.  After all, while it was a well-written and well-played rock album, for the most part the songs on it weren't all that original or complex.  In general, it was the type of album I usually tire of after one or two listens, but that wasn't happening this time.  Eventually, I realized just what it was that made me like the Whigs so much: emotion.  Almost every note of the album was delivered with an unmistakable fire and passion, and that energy was infectious.  The songs on Black Love were felt as much as they were played.<br /><br />By now you might be wondering, what exactly does the foregoing story have to do with Nickelback, the band I'm supposed to be discussing?  Well, quite a bit, actually.  In sharp contrast to the Afghan Whigs, Nickelback represent everything that's wrong about the state of mainstream rock today: while they are technically competent, Nickelback's music is completely devoid of anything that bears even a passing resemblance to soul.  With the possible exception of Puddle of Mudd, I've never heard a band that was more blatantly going through the motions than these guys.  How You Remind Me, this album's best-known number and probably the most overplayed song ever performed by somewhat not named Celine Dion, is a perfect example of the problem.  This song doesn't song like it was written to make an emotional statement, or reflect any artistic ambitions on the part of the band; it sounds like it was written to be a hit.  Of course, How You Remind Me was in fact a huge hit, but writing a hit song isn't the same thing as writing a good song.<br /><br />The rest of Silver Side Up suffers from the same problem.  Nickelback obviously refuse to jeopardize their record sales by doing anything foolish, like taking a risk or doing something original.  Too Bad is basically the same song as How You Remind Me, except frontman Chad (Jesus) Kroeger is apparently supposed to be mad at his father instead of at his ex.  Sorry guys, but that doesn't exactly count as diversity.  Never Again sounds like it was intended to be the \\"heavy, angry\\" song that established the band's hard-rock credibility, but it just comes off sounding flat, bland, and uninspired.

Too Bad is basically the same song as How You Remind Me, except frontman Chad (Jesus) Kroeger is apparently supposed to be mad at his father instead of at his ex.  Sorry guys, but that doesn't exactly count as diversity.  Never Again sounds like it was intended to be the \\"heavy, angry\\" song that established the band's hard-rock credibility, but it just comes off sounding flat, bland, and uninspired.

B000683VI4|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. It has an amazing cast, with a great mixture of fresh faces and more familiar ones. The plot and script are wonderful. It makes you laugh and cry throughout it's 124 mins. One of my personal favorites of all time!
B000268QB2|4.0|I THOUGHT THIS BAND WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER \\"COLDPLAY\\"<br /><br />KNOCKOFF,BUT I WAS SOOOOOO WRONG,THEY HAVE THIER OWN<br /><br />SIGNATURE SOUND, THE SONG \\"SHE HAS NO TIME WILL BLOW YOUR<br /><br />MIND! THE ULTILMATE \\"BREAK-UP SONG
B0006399FS|5.0|Wow, I'm really surprised by all the negative reviews. This is a deep, passionate collection of songs about life, family, faith, love and loss. This isn't the kind of music that 20 year olds make; every song is overflowing with the experience of a group of men who've been around the block a time or two. Bono's voice has aged, and he can't always hit those lovely high notes that used to make my toes curl up back in the day, but he can still paint a portrait with his singing that's simply unique. The Edge, of course, has obviously not aged at all! His playing has never been better. In \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\", a song about Bono's relationship with his father, Bono is pouring his heart out, and Edge takes every signature trademark he has, trills, chimes, and the delayed guitar and lovingly adds them in to create something that's just so amazing.  <br /> <br />This is getting maudlin isn't it? And, pointing out that not only are the band members not in their 20s anymore, but are making music about things that matter, and not just picking up chicks at the club; is probably not the best way to get the average rock lover to buy the CD. Oh well, U2 RULZ! Bono 4EVA! The Edge is KEWL!  <br /> <br />For all the grown-ups who know this band, all I have to say is that HTDAAB is a really good CD. It's not The Joshua Tree or Actung, Baby, but that's not a bad thing. Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree were made by men experiencing the boundless enthusiasm of their 20s. AB and Zooropa reflected the increasing cynicism of their 30s. AYCLB and this CD are all about getting to that big 4-0 and taking stock of the things that are really important in life; and it's wonderful.
B0000039PW|5.0|Well, listening to this CD reminds me why Biggie is regarded as one of the best rappers that we've ever seen and I really like his flow and especially his dope rhymes(which I personally regard is bing the most creative part about his skills). <br /> <br />Hip-Hop fans should add this CD to their collection.
0380733358|5.0|This is the first Ken Follet book that I read, and afterwards I was hooked into reading more of his titles.  If you haven't seen the movie based on this book (it premiered in 1981) don't rent it until you've first read the book.  This book sparked me into reading more about the history of WWII.
B0006399FS|1.0|This pathetic musical effort is unforgivable. The main reason why I hate it is... Mr Paul Hewson, better known as \\"Bono\\". <br /> <br />The truth is that Bono does not deserve to sing for this former great band anymore. He just plain sounds horrible. He simply cannot sing. Listen to \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" and then this... His voice is annoying at the least !!!. <br /> <br />U2 should quit as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> <br />
076790592X|5.0|I'd avoided reading this for a long time because I thought it was about dying - death scenes are always so wrenching for me. However, this simple concept, of tapping Morrie's soul little by little, one day at a time, was easy to digest. It turned out to be a huge life lesson in a very small package. I smiled a lot, cried a little.  <br /> <br />It's a book I want to revisit again for the reminder I seem to need, which is to stop worrying about the trivia in life, to slow down and focus on what's really important, and to live fully in the moment I'm in.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNEW|3.0|I'm a total sucker for sports movies.  And I'm not ashamed to admit that I am totally taken in by the Disney-style, get hyped-up, go-for-it, ultimate release, feel-good movies exemplified by Hoosiers, Remember the Titans, the Rookie, and Miracle (for example), and I have quite a nice DVD sports collection.  So \\"one of the best sports movies of all time\\" was high on my list for viewing--- and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.  I have no argument with the actors; Thornton delivers a largely understated performance (except for the screaming), nor do I havea problem with the whole \\"win the whole thing\\" mentality.  I appreciate that the movie really focused more on the dangers of obsession rather than football, and perhaps that's what made it disappointing: instead of getting excited and rah-rah, I was depressed.  I don't care that they didn't adhere religiously to the facts (what movie does?  It's a movie and should be enjoyed [or not] based on its own merits).  Even the \\"be perfect\\" speech at the end, the redemption of just being as good a person as you can be, came too late.  Why tell the boys to be perfect all season (implying that they must win each game) and then define \\"perfection\\" with a half-hour of football left in the year?  The ultimate redemption just fell flat.  Rocky lost his match at the end of the (first, of course) movie, and you still jumped up and cheered.  I could care less about these guys.  And that made me sad.  This movie, I'm sorry to say, is not on my \\"best sports movies of all time\\" list.  Not even close.  For the record, my number 1 is Bull Durham.  All the others mentioned above are on the list too.  Because they make me feel good  ---- and Friday Night Lights definitely did not.
B00000JJQK|3.0|A nice Beach Boys album. Several great tracks (Wouldn't It Be Nice, Sloope John B., God Only Knows, Carolina No), some fillers with excrutiating banality, and then some silly games with a sound effects machine. If you like the Beach Boys, go at it. But the best album of all time? Please. Doesn't hold a candle to Revolver, the White Album, Wish You were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, The Joshua Tree, Actung Baby, Who's Next, Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, Led Zepplin IV, etc. etc. It's embarrassing to make that claim for a album that is half fluff and 2/3rds pretension.
0451191153|4.0|FountainHead and Atlas Shrugged are two books, especially the former, that have gained the status of Modern Classics. The thoughts expressed below are, well, my general thoughts on the two most popular works of Ayn Rand. <br /> <br />        After I finished reading FountainHead, the character that impressed me the most was Gail Wynand, the next being the iconoclast Ellsworth Toohey. I found the final monologue, if monologue is the word I am looking for, of Toohey to Peter Keating and the defense of Roark(for those who have not read the book, Howard Roark happens to be the Hero of Fountain Head) in the climax the most impressive parts of the book. It is definitely a book that is a must read for any bibliophile worth his salt. In fact, each of the characters sketched out by the writer in Fountain Head have something definite and unique. In stark contrast to this, Atlas Shrugged has most of the characters, the Heroes of the book, very similar to one another and after the point to be put across is put across, the theme repeats itself again and again and the writer tends to get excessively didactic. I must, at this point, confess that the 90-odd page radio speech by John Galt, in Atlas Shrugged, took a lot out of me, leaving me practically a spent force by the time I finished the Chapter ''This is John Galt speaking''. The sheer size of the book Atlas Shrugged is very intimidating. Anyway, I managed to read that, spreading it over a period of nearly four months.  <br /> <br />        Ayn Rand happens to be one of the most compelling and influential writers I have ever read. Though it is highly difficult to rise up to the standards set in her philosophies they definitely influence the reader immensely. The philosophy she professes though hard to live up to and emulate definitely sets standards to the way an ideal man has to live. I do not presently remember, but a writer or critic once pointed out that after reading Fountain Head, one would feel that the rest ofthe writers through the generations have written their works while sitting on the potty or something to that effect. Though I would say that saying so is going a bit too far, it definitely gives an idea as to how powerful Ayn Rand's writings are. <br /> <br />        Delving for a while on the cover illustration of FountainHead, I have this little theory of mine that it shows the picture of the Titan Prometheus from Greek Mythology, stealing fire from Gods, which, as the legend goes, he gifts to mankind and for doing so Zeus punishes him by chaining him to a rock and leaving eagles (another version says it is vultures) to gnaw at him. The illustration in a way, I think, encompasses, or is symbolizes the word I really am looking for, the idea of the Creator, the first to go on an un-laid path only to get pilloried, inviting the world to point the finger of disdain and scorn, the idea Roark so convincingly presents in his defense. <br /> <br />        In Ayn Rand's own words, the philosophy of objectivism sums up to this: <br />''My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.'' In a nutshell, one sees the Earth in the eyes of Ayn Rand as a place where there is no room for those wallowing in mediocrity. Well, that, if you practically look at, sends most of us packing to the outer space with a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; but then, that is neither here nor there. The nearest antonym to ego, according to her, is altruism. Her theories severely pan the concept of Collectivism and glorify Individualism and the Virtue of Selfishness. In this context, it doesn't need a rocket scientist to understand her views on Soviet Communism vis-a-vis American Capitalism. It would be of interest to psychologists to know that the writer was a Russian immigrant to the United States.  <br /> <br />The Ayn Rand Stereotype: <br />        Ever observed? All her heroes have to possess lean frames with athletic builds and angular faces (Hank Rearden, Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, Howard Roark). All the bad guys should be fat with flabby masses of flesh falling off their bodies (Peter Keating, James Taggart, Ellsworth Toohey et. al.). All her heroines (Dagny Taggart, Dominque Francon) have to invariably sleep with all her heroes. Of course, in pointing out the last observation, i don't mean to say that Dagny Taggart from Atlas shrugged goes out all the way to sleep with Howard Roark who appears in FountainHead. <br /> <br />PS: Err... possibly this review is more comprehensible for those who have read Ayn Rand's works.
0743455967|5.0|The first half is autobiographical, and I'm willing to bet you'll never see Stephen King in the same light after reading it. Many people view rich, successful authors as some kind of pampered royalty, but this book shows just how much hard work it takes to get to the very top. <br /> <br />The second half is stunning, but in a different way. Preconceptions about writing are nailed to the wall and shot full of holes, and you come away with a realistic grounding in the writing game. Scented writing paper and lavender coloured ink are nowhere to be seen.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down really stepped up their already considerable musical ability with their sophmore release.  Weaving in and out of speed metal and haunting melodies with their inherited middle eastern influence creates a unique sound entirely SOAD's own.  I can't wait to see where they go with it when they're next album is released later this year. <br /> <br />If you're into SOAD you should also check out Fair to Midland.  These guys list System as a heavy influence but have a Native American influenced metal sound all of their own.  If only they were to hook up with Rick Rubin!
1592400876|5.0|A book on punctuation which reads more like a Bill Bryson title. Funny and clever, this one should be in every writer's arsenal.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I watched Collateral for about 10 minutes and fell in love with Foxx's charecter. Foxx play \\"Max\\" taxi driver with dreams but not actions. Tom Cruise plays \\"Vincent\\" a hitman that is as cool as ice and you can not help but like him. Throughout the movie Max drives Vincent across LA to different assasination points all the while discusing everything from the philosophy of killing a man to the improvisation of jazz. Overall I thought the movie was great. I thought the screen play was spot on, the plot twist was not predictable, and the way Mann filmed LA at night was simply beautiful. The scene where the car was parked at a light and you see the silhouette of the palm trees against the incandescent LA sky was gorgeous, along with the three coyotes. The only thing i did not like about the movie was the shift from a psychological thriller to a shoot-em-up action movie near the end, i really enjoyed the dialogue a lot.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is a product of the ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, so who cares what genre it falls under? This fun flick is a spoof on zombie films in general, and like most zombie films, has some pretty well thought out social commentary embedded into it.<br /><br />The dry British humor is there, as well as the Western influence. A loyal, good-hearted appliance store manager, whose life consists of playing video games, downing pints, and trying to keep his girlfriend happy is the center. A plague spreads, and soon most of the world has become zombified...it is time for Shaun to step up, save his friends and take charge of his otherwise pathetic life.<br /><br />Maybe I liked this because I could relate to Shaun. My wife said he reminded her of me, an underachiever (was she ripping on herself, then?). Like many male icons before him- the three stooges, Rodney Dangerfield, and Homer Simpson...there is something about Shaun that should strike a chord in most average men (not that Shaun is a \\"male icon,' but you know what I'm getting at).<br /><br />I reccomend this to fans of British comedy and mainstream horror. I knocked off a star, 'cause I thought the actor who played the fatso was pretty horrible.
B00064MW6A|3.0|i watched this movie and was glad i rented it instead of buying  <br />it first.  i think it is good enough for a viewing, but also think the story may make a better comic. you kinda scratch your head at this one. like you wanna like it. halle berry was fine as <br />catwoman and did her due, but seems like somehow it couldve been better. what this movie needs is a sequel where you can go, whew, <br />much better.  this is a start and leads room for the improvement. <br />
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This band is awesome, their guitar playing, their lyrics, their intire sound is just godly. I do enjoy Mars Volta but I wish that At The Drive-In was still around.
0671798154|5.0|This book was recommended to me, or I doubt I'd have given it a second glance. I got burnt out on Nazi based \\"thrillers\\" years ago. I happily report having enjoyed every single page of this unexpectedly entertaining thrill-ride. It was fast paced throughout, smartly written, plausibly plotted, and despite other reviews giving far too much away, not at all predictable. This was my first James Thayer novel, and I'm writing this immediately before going on a heated search for more. Fear not, your reading dollars are well invested here.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|In a word ----- \\"Spectacular!\\" <br /> <br />Buble and Foster make the most beautiful music. This cd is Spectacular from 1st track to last. <br /> <br />I could not have wished for a fuller, more diverse mix of songs and from Feeling Good on, I was \\"Feeling Good\\" listening.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Hugh Jackman, fresh off the smash hit that was X2, stars in this action/horror movie about a tough action hero and a beautiful princess beating up monsters. The action scenes are elegantly done, sort of like the scenes of the X-Men movies, only with little flying half-bat, half humans. It gets a little long, but other than that, this is perhaps the best action/adventure of the year. a perfect movie for 12 year olds.
B00005QFE5|5.0|It is rare that a movie can transcend language and cultural barriers to convey a story that appeals to the emotions of the viewer.  The Road Home is one such movie.  Without resorting to a summary of the movie, which is surely repeated elsewhere, the Road Home is a love story.  Despite being unable to appreciate the magnitude of the marriage for love concept as opposed to marriage by arrangement, as I am an American, I was still able to recognize the love depicted in this movie.  Despite not being able to understand Mandarin/Cantonese, the emotions are clearly conveyed through the actors.  One feels for them and roots for them even if there is no blatant antagonist to rouse your emotions.  Clearly the movie has touched other viewers as it won the Audience Award at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival and Silver Berlin Bear at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival.  The Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern and Ju Dou) film bloodlines do not raise unattainable standards or expectations, but may actually raise the standards for his other movies.  If Zhang Ziyi is typecast later as a method actor good only for martial arts and sex kitten roles, one need only view this movie to see that they are wrong.    You should watch this movie.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|Take Cube 1 and 2, combine them, and you get this movie. It's better than the second but not as good as the first. The genius aspect of the original Cube was how the story could be debated by and left people wondering and gathering their own conclusions while at the same time remaining a very interesting and not hard to understand movie. This movie however supposedly happens before Cube and creates a story for you to attempt to explain Cube.  <br /> <br />In Cube Zero one of the lower end cube operators begins to wonder and ask the wrong questions. The more he learns the more he questions the cube, and eventually ends up inside of it. The whole story of the movie is served to you with a silver spoon and while it's fun while watching, after the movie ends you forget it as if you never seen it. Definitely does not have the impact effect of Cube after seeing it.  <br /> <br />Even though lacking the genius of the original Cube this movie does have quite an interesting story, lots of neat special effects, and awesome traps just waiting to claim their victims. In my opinion it's definitely worth watching, especially if you have seen the first 2 of the series.
B000683VI4|5.0|filled with marvelous performances by everyone in the cast, to great, moving direction by nick cassavetes, this film excels in every way, from start to haunting finish! it's a rare beauty of a film, filled with humor, deep love, and a truly haunting story-it was so much better than the book. it's really beautiful to behold, very deep, with a revealing secret that will deeply move you over and over again. a real keeper for your dvd collection. do not miss it.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Robert De Niro at his all time best, and that's saying something. Not only is his acting some of the best ever, but the sixty pound weight gain is truly an amazing feat for an actor. The only performances close to this in terms of full physical commitment would be the rail thin Tom Hanks in \\"Cast Away,\\" Charlize Theron in \\"Monster,\\" and a blinded by prosthetics Jamie Foxx in \\"Ray.\\" This is my choice for the best sports film ever made, followed by Clint Eastwood's \\"Million Dollar Baby.\\" All the acting here is top notch, especially Joe Pesci in his breakout role and Cathy Moriarty as Jake La Motta's wife. This is not an inspiring story, rather it is one of sad decline and defeat. Martin Scorsese was at his best with \\"Raging Bull\\" and it is my favorite film of his followed closely by \\"Goodfellas.\\" It is about time this film got a Special Edition DVD and this one is loaded with Making of Documentaries, three Commentaries, and a great picture & sound transfer. Without a doubt this is must buy for any movie fan's collection.
B000002H97|5.0|Many people accused Metallica of selling out on this album because their songs are slower, less complex, and stick to one riff throughout the entire song. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, especially since other essential elements to Metallica's sound are still present: powerful riffs, good guitar soloing, and Hetfield's trademark growl, which is better than ever. Actually almost everything sound better than ever thanks to excellent production, a welcome sound after the terrible sound found on ...And Justice for All.<br />\\"Enter Sandman\\" starts off the album with a memorable riff and contains the chorus that eveybody knows \\"Exit liiiight, enter night.\\" \\"Sad but True\\" is the heaviest song off of the album with great guitar work by Hetfield. How can you help not singing along with the lines \\"Hey, hey, I'm your life, I'm the one who gets you they-ah\\"? \\"The Unforgiven\\" is a heavy, but touching ballad with one of Hammett's best solos ever. \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" has a middle-eastern sound, and they try to incorperate a sitar into the beginning of the song, but it doesn't add much. That being said this is an awesome, pounding song with excellent guitar work by Hammett. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is the second ballad on the disc and is also very powerful. It features only  acoustic guitar for most of the song and Hetfield actually sings instead of growling and he actually sounds great (although this would not work on their later albums), also there is a string section. This is a very moving song and is completely different than anything Metallica has ever done before. \\"The God That Failed\\" has an awesome riff that is similar to the one in Bad Company's \\"Feel Like Makin' Love,\\" only this song also has a decent guitar solo as well.<br />Fans should not have made such a fuss about Metallica \\"selling out\\" because this is still a great album, and is not at all a step down from \\"...And Justice for All.\\" In fact, the only problem with the album is several poor songs and weak riffs, the latter is something that I have never heard before with Metallica. Some people say that Metallica wrote a bunch of singles and used filler songs to make a complete album. It's true that there were many singles that receive regular airplay still on rock stations. This is actually bad though, since many of the songs are overplayed and as a result, their significance and brilliance is overlooked. This album is as good as critics and fans alike have made it out to be, and it belongs in any metal fan's CD library.ter is something that I have never heard before with Metallica.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|4 out of 5 stars with close to 700 reviews? What is wrong here? Are we rejoicing because we finally see somebody who is just a little dumber than our (obviously) dumb selves, or is it the relief that comes from knowing that our moronic lifestyle (be it past or present) is in fact a widespread phenomena? It's amazing how nothing amazes us anymore.(sic) Oh, wait! But it's not true! Here is a completely cretinous movie, with no plot, beginning or ending - which manages to evoke feelings of admiration even jealousy. \\"Wow, this movie is so dumb it's almost great, even I could've made it! How come I didn't think of it first?\\" I wholeheartedly recommend this movie! Let's watch it and recommend it and wonder why does the rest of the world think that we are oh ... so stupid.

B00007GZR5|4.0|The best parts of this film are the excellent visual effects and the superb art direction.  The story is actually quite somber with death and the effect of sin on the afterlife being major, heavy themes.  The finest acting performance here comes from Annabella Sciorra, who survives the deaths of her two children with the help of her husband (played by a subdued Robin Williams), only to lose her husband a few years later.  That's when the story takes off.  Robin William's character, like all who enter the afterlife as good people, creates his own Heaven from his past experiences.  In his case, he was a huge fan of painting, and his painted Heaven is a one-of-a-kind visual effects creation.  After he becomes accustomed to his afterlife he is told that his wife commited suicide and will not be joining him in his Heaven, ever.  But True Love knows no bounds, and he obtains a tracker and eventually journeys into the circles of Hell (Dante-style, frequently reminiscent of the epic poem \\"Infernus\\") to find his beloved.  The realms in which this sojourn takes him are truly frightening and have many distrubing images.  While the ending is a little too schmaltzy for my tastes (even the alternate ending on the DVD has a similar feel to it), it is the type of ending the audience wants and deserves.  I just think they lay it on the viewer too thickly.  Robin Williams tries hard here and is more often good than not, but he ultimately feels miscast in this role.  Annabella Sciorra's performance more than makes up for Robin Williams being, well, 'himself' too often.  But the two leads do have some good chemistry together.  That, and the sublime special effects mixed with some spectacular set designs make this film work.  The DVD features are also enlightening and worth seeing.  Recommended.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|jet. get born. I gotta say when I heard this album for the first time i felt like I got hit by a eighteen wheeler truck! My love of music is straight forward, no holds barred, turn it up to 11 rock n roll, and with the state of music today, and over the last many years, this album is what i was waiting for! this album is truly classic! the one thing that struck me about this album when you hear it is that for once, a great rock n roll band pays its respects and influences to those who well deserve it. \\"are you gonna be my girl\\" has a iggy pop/stooges feel,\\"look what you've done\\" and \\"move on\\" takes you back to the stones days of sticky fingers and exile on main street, \\"move on\\" being the song the stones probably wish they had written. \\"cold hard b****\\", a nod back to the days when bands like ac/dc and t.rex ruled the land. \\"lazy gun\\", carries an oasis feel to it, one of they're favorites. <br />jet is exactly how i like my rock n roll, loud, heavy, melodic, beautiful, simple, turned up to 11. \\"get born\\" is raw, loud, uncompromising, pure rock n roll from four guys who know what the true spirit of rock n roll is supposed to be about. definitely a must have! if you ain't got it get it!!!!!!!!!! GET BORN!!!!!!!!!!
B00004VVNB|4.0|This movie is just plain fun.  The story is a good one, the acting is passable more often than not, and the special effects are often so dated and cheesy as to feel nostalgic.  I first saw this film when I was a child and I remembered much more than I would have imagined possible.  With a child the most important aspects of a film are plotting and interesting characters, and that is what this film has in spades.  The fact that brassiers are out of style in the 23rd century also makes for a promising future. ;)  Michael York plays a Sandman named Logan, a police character who hunts down and 'terminates' what are called 'runners.'  Members of this enclosed society who have come of age (30-years-old) are up for possible 'renewal' in an event called 'Carrousel.'  Those who are of age that do not show up at 'Carrousel' are considered 'runners.'  Michael York (an upstanding Sandman) is summoned by the great machine that oversees this seeming Utopia and is given a mission that requires he be thought of as a 'runner' to gain the trust of unacquired 'runners' still at large throughout the city.  As a result, his final four years as a citizen is wiped away and he starts to consider the possibilty that the great machine is not 'renewing' anyone at all, but that they all die in 'Carrousel.'  The seed of doubt is sewn in his mind and \\"Logan's Run\\" begins.  The miniatures used as buildings, etc. are all fake-looking but are still great to look at, the special effects are often laughable, but the story is good and the film is ultimately entertaining all the way to the last scene.

B00005JNPZ|4.0|Will Smith stars as Hitch, a counselor for men who are having trouble making that first move toward a relationship.  One of his main focuses during the movie is an accountant played by a thinner Kevin James (compared to the first couple of seasons in King of Queens).  Kevin's character is attracted to a beautiful heiress played by Cameron Diaz-wannabe Amber Valetta.  <br />Enter sub-plot #2: Eva Mendes portrays a gossip columnist headstrong in the belief that, sooner or later, every guy with lie to you, cheat on you, or both.  Hitch tries to convince her otherwise while convincing himself that not all women are eventually evil either.  <br />The movie's greatest feature is being able to show just about every aspect or viewpoint one would have about starting a relationship, from the lovesick to the downright sick of love individuals.  <br />The writing and acting are very well done, mostly because they keep Amber's lines to a minimum.  <br />The reason for my ALMOST perfect title to this is because, toward the end, the movie gets WAY too Hallmark card-ish.  If you see the movie, you'll know where it starts.  This plus the Ellis Island scene could have had some of the documentary part trimmed a bit. <br />I would highly recommend this movie for a date, especially a first date.  I would not advise bringing the kids to this one due to all of the sexual innuendo.  <br />Warnings: profanity, sexual innuendo, people doing the 'robot' dance, and pigheadedness from both sexes.  Like I said, it's a great date movie.  :)  <br />Final note of the movie: if your movie is being sponsored by, let's say, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, it's probably not a good idea to represent them as a source for suicide inducing and heart failure.
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas isn't your average novel. In fact, it could be argued that this is not a novel at all, more like a collection of 6 short stories, each about 80 pages in lenght and each sharing the same overarching theme: slavery. Ok, there is a thin red line connecting every tale but don't see too much in it, really, it's more a clever narrative touch than anything else (still, some reviewers noted that, supposedly, this expedient is used to suggest that there is only one main character in the novel, and the 6 tales merely depict his various incarnations, in different times and places). Oh, talking about narrative expedients: I thought that the idea of splitting every story in two halves and putting them at diffent ends of the book was quite pointless. And: the central story (I mean, the tale that lies at the centre of the book) is written in an awful dialect, full of elisions that render the whole text unreadable.<br /><br />But enough with the criticism: Mitchell crafted a niece piece of prose and the stories are very engaging (again, I cannot vouch for the central one because I didn't read it but in either case 5 out of 6 ain't a bad deal....), so much so that I practically devoured them! Now I'm waiting for his next work!
0151008116|1.0|I picked up Life Of Pi because it is such a popular book.  I just could not get into it though.  I really liked the author's descriptive and straightforward narrative, but the plot/theme was just not for me i guess.  Definitely give it a shot, but maybe get it at the library first.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Disney's charming animated film called Pinnochio is a beautifully animated and entertainingly told piece of movie history.  This is definitely a classic, in all scopes of the imagination.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|I first watched this movie when I was in my teens and Mildred and Joan became two of my role models.  I agree with the other reviewers and the Amazon editorial review - Joan's status as a film legend & icon is well deserved and if you need to know why, watch this film.  The movie consists of one sassily written and dazzlingly acted scene after another.  The actors and the costumes are total black and white eye candy.  I still have the VHS version and many a lazy day I pop it in the VCR and let it repeat over and over while I work.   I NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT and it has yet to become background noise even while I play it over and over. <br /> <br />A must-have.
1573226521|5.0|Today I finished listening to The Beach on tape after several days of commuting an hour each way to and from work. I hardly remember the miles I was so swept up in this well-told story. It's definitely a tape/page-turner. Made me almost look forward to going to work just so I could hear another hour!
B0006M4SO6|2.0|I just don't get this album.  It sounds tired.  I've loved Pat's music ever since his late teens.  Heck, his grandpa worked where I did--I used to get my Dodge serviced at his dad's dealership--I even lived in several locations he used for titles.  I love his atonal stuff and his romantic stuff, his ersatz Dead, his work with Ornette and Gary Burton. But over the last few years, his composing has lost its freshness, its heart.. It is technically proficient--and his soloing has evolved in some ways.  But the chord changes and musical phrases are overly familiar here.  The form of the work is new, but the content is...well, it sounds like watered down Pat Metheny.
0140288503|5.0|Wow!  Mark Bowden shows the flair that he picked up as a journalist for picking and telling engaging stories in this tale of a US Army operation gone horribly awry.  Bowden's writing puts you into the middle of the action and captures the emotion and chaos that is inevitable in any combat situation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in learning more about the nature of modern skirmish warfare or for anyone who just enjoys reading a really well-told war story.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|This was the best movie i have ever saw.  Ryan and Rachel were perfect for the part. Nobody else could have done as well as they did. They warmed up the hearts and made the tears fall.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Disney hit gold with The Little Mermaid, a charming, beautifully awesome film that is up there as one of the best animated films of all time!
B00005KARK|5.0|My main compliant with this dvd is the fact that it's a short movie, yet still priced so high.  Maybe they could have made a cool two disk set with tons of extras for this price, but maybe that's planned for the future.<br /><br />In any case, the movie, as short as it is, is still a classic and is worth owning if you are into Disney films and have kids.  Even though it lacks the adult humor and sophistication of today's modern animation and certainly isn't as polished the modern computer aided visuals are, the writing, especially in the movies songs, is well done and allows the movie to stand as solid entertainment.<br /><br />The sequence Pink Elephants on Parade is perhaps one of animations greatest ever, and its dated art, while placing it the period it was done, is still outstanding and worth the price of admission by itself.  The crows singing about never seeing an elephant fly is another great musical sequence.  The musical portions coupled with the fairly basic plot line make this an attractive movie for young children, the story is endearing, and the main character lovable, a solid recommendation for the dvd library.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|There have been other releases on VHS (Max R&B, Who's Better Who's Best) that should also be released and contain a lot more songs.  <br /> <br />This is a tribute to the classic Who when Keith Moon was the drummer, and contains a mix of interviews, sketches, promo videos, and performance footage that ranges from fun to mesmerizing.  <br /> <br />A lot of the pre-\\"Tommy\\" material is represented, a few \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Who's Next\\" tracks, as well as seeing them in the studio recording \\"Who Are You\\". You see Moonie trashing hotel rooms, John Entwhistle shooting gold records, and Pete in full pontificating mode, with Roger taking a back seat in most of the interviews... considering that Pete wrote the songs and Keith was the joker there was little room left for Daltrey to get a word in. However when he gets on stage, he takes over.  <br /> <br />But they also manage to avoid being a \\"Spinal Tap\\" by poking fun at themselves and having fun. And it is F-U-N.  <br /> <br />It's great to finally see the theatrical version after being used to seeing videotaped copies over the years and the \\"Who's Next\\" songs just leap out at you like a band with something to prove.
B00000JHAU|5.0|There isn't much I can say about this album that hasn't already been said.  It is wonderful, and one of my favorites.  The \\"spotlight review\\" at the top of the reviews has really angered me, though.  Intelligent and informed listeners of music do not base their opinions of albums on what they think about other albums.  For example, if I were to say, \\"I listened to 'If You're Feeling Sinister,' and I didn't like it as much as a Magnetic Fields album...\\"  This is not helpful to anyone.  Also, anyone that buys music based on hype should be sentenced to Top 40 for life.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney's Oscar-winning animated Beauty and the Beast is a truly touching, pivotal piece of art that is both enjoyable, breathtaking and essential in all its splendor.  The opening scene that flashes the movie's title in beautiful ribbons is gorgeous itself, but it's its strong heroine, entertaining songs and beautiful animation that truly grab the audience.  PERFECT.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is amazing ... a real tear jerker, but in a good way.  Ryan Gosling (\\"Remember the Titans\\") was AMAZING ... as was Gena Rowlands (but then, when isn't Gena Rowlands amazing?!?!) and James   Garner.  This is a must-buy movie ... if you rent it, you won't want to send it back ...
B000001FKY|5.0|The best Hard Rock album of the 1980's, as far as I'm concerned, and it has stood the test of time.  It's one of a handful of albums from the 80's that I have not outgrown at all.  It didn't sell 15 million+ copies for nothing.  All killer and no filler.  The first half of the album were all hits, spanning a two-year period from 1987-1989.  If I didn't know better, I'd think \\"Hysteria\\" is a Greatest Hits compilation.  It's that great.
B00004XONN|1.0|bleeps and bloops, my friends, bleeps and bloops.  Remember old modems, all the noise when they'd dial-up.  That's Kid A.<br /><br />If you want SONGWRITING buy Radioheads first three albums, each of which is amazing.
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|Living in Japan I have had access to this movie on DVD (obviously without the american voice talent) for over a year. I think that this movie is probably more suited for gals, especially young women, than guys. It's central theme is that of a teenage girl breaking away from a stifling society and discovering herself...much like many young Japanese women felt when this movie was originally released. Just be careful because this moive is essentially a chick flick. a very good one, but a chick flick nonetheless.The movie wasn't able to sustain my interest and i found myself clock watching. The animation is beautiful and the atmosphere is typical Miyazaki, ie. pea-soup thick, but overall it left me somewhat bored. (But I loved Totoro, Mononoke, Sen to chihiro, and Laputa)
B00005JNEI|4.0|I don't know what I can add to the nearly 1,800 reviews that are already here, but here goes... <br /> <br />It's understandable that after experiencing the darkest side of American capitalism first hand in Flint, MI, that Michael Moore still thinks that US foreign policy is all about the money, but I sat through this whole movie waiting for him to drop the bombshell that a good chunk of what the \\"neo-cons\\" are about is fundamentalist Christianity...but that never came. Hell, even 60 Minutes ran a piece last year about how potentially powerful the evangelicals are, politically, in the US. <br /> <br />There is a lot of debate going around right now as to what \\"neo-conservativism\\" really is, and whether or not it actually exists. I don't feel that it's too much of a mystery. Yeah, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, etc. don't carry cards in their wallets saying that they are \\"neo-cons,\\" nor do they sport neo-con T-shirs under their shirts and ties, nor do they have a secret handshake, but there is a very real movement afoot among them and others like them; and it's purpose is to build a world in America's image: not just a world of democracy and capitalism, but a world that practices these things EXACTLY like America does; no more, no less. The tragic events of 9/11 have given them just cause, as they see it, to say, \\"No more, Mr. Nice Guy,\\" and bring their ideology \\"out of the closet,\\" to a greater degree, as if to say to the democrats, and the rest of the world, \\"Okay, your way didn't work with these terrorists, so now we're going to do it OUR way\\"...and, in this way, the 9/11 terrorists gave them exactly the grist they needed for things like a Homeland Security Dept., \\"The Patriot Act,\\" and the Iraq war. <br /> <br />There is no question in my mind that fundamentalist/evangelical Christianity is behind the neo-con movement...the only question is to what degree are they fundamentalists themselves, and to what degree are they just pandering to fundamentalist fears and values in order to secure 70,000,000 votes every election. The disorganized democratic party needs to wake up to how much political power the evangelical movement wields and how unified they are in their vision of one nation, and one world, under the Christian god. They are potentially every bit as dangerous as the fundementalist Islamic terrorists that the neo-cons have waged war against, perhaps even more so. <br /> <br />Moore completely misses the religious aspect of the \\"war on terrorism,\\" making it mostly just about Saudi oil money, and I feel that as much sediment as this movie stirred up, some people just found that a little hard to believe. If he had brought up the whole \\"holy war\\" aspect of this conflict, it would've brought the wrath of the bible thumpers down on him (although it's hard to imagine that Moore would be intimidated by that), but it probably would've ruffled some more of the RIGHT feathers as well. Furthermore, Moore seems to get a little more \\"grandstandy\\" with each documentary, driving in thumbtacks with sledgehammers; and I think this tends to appeal more and more to the \\"choir\\" that's already on his side, and less and less to people on the fence whose minds might otherwise be changed by his movies. The \\"ice cream truck loudspeaker\\" bit in this movie, might've been a little much, for example. I know some pretty liberal people who think that Michael Moore's getting to be too much of a smart ass. If it gets to the point where too many people \\"run and hide when they see you coming\\" how effective can you be? <br /> <br />Fundamentalist religion, and the corresponding belief that \\"man\\"--as God/Allah's favored species--can do whatever the hell he wants here on earth, is the single biggest threat to humanity...and those of us who can still think for ourselves need to wake up to that fact, while we can still save our civilization. Organized religion has little to do with TRUE faith, or REAL spirituality. One can be completely \\"godless\\" and still have faith, and still be deeply spiritual.
B000001DV2|3.0|This album sounds similar to Hysteria which is it's strength AND weakness.  Two years of Hysteria touring and promotion caused this follow-up to sound a little bit tired.  Maybe the guys needed a longer break after the Hysteria tour (or perhaps they spent too much time in the studio).  The absence of the late Steve Clark had a negative impact on this project as well.  Phil Collen attempts to play guitar parts sounding like Steve, but only to mild success.  Still this is a very respectable album.  \\"White Lightning\\" is reason enough to get it.  A great epic song that's reminds me of \\"Gods of War\\" from Hysteria.
B000002BBY|5.0|Well, I guess it is.<br /><br />But it's still as amazing as it was a decade ago when it came out.  I've always felt Noel is one of the most underrated lead-guitarists ever.  Not too mention his songwriting was superb and his brother's voice fit perfect for the melodies he crafted.
B0002858YS|4.0|This band plays good rock music.  Great base licks and good vocals.  It takes a few listens to get into it but I enjoy it.
0385510454|5.0|The Broker has an ending...and this is a great book! <br /> <br />Unlike John Grisham's endings to his more recent books, \\"The Broker\\" has an ending we can all appreciate. For that, I am grateful. <br /> <br />In \\"The Broker\\", Grisham methodically leads the reader through an array of obstacles that kept me intrigued, interested, and on the edge of my chair to the end of the book. It is Grisham at his finest and once page one was read, it was hard to put the book down. <br /> <br />Between the various worldwide governments and their representative assassins, does the main character, Joel Backman, have a chance of surviving? Because Backman possesses information related to very sophisticated technology, he is being pursued by various  governments, including the United States. The reader follows Backman, known as the broker, on an exciting international adventure of survival. <br /> <br />Who knows, maybe Grisham will follow up on this book with a sequel.
B0000026J1|4.0|...to The final countdown.  \\"The final countdown\\" was such a big hit that many forget how popular \\"Superstitious\\" was also.  It made the US Top 40 and got huge rotation on MTV.  Out of this world basically continues the melodic direction set by The final countown, but this album has a little more crunch.  The guitars are pushed up a bit.  The album is a bit over-produced (to the band's admission) and could have been better if it had been left a little more rough.  Still a fine album though.  Lots of feel-good songs and unforgettable melodies all througout, especially in \\"superstitious\\", \\"let the good times rock\\", \\"more than meets the eye\\", \\"sign of the times\\" and \\"never say die\\".  I just love Europe's ability to combine guitars with keyboards.  Not unique, but rare.  This is for all fans of melodic hard rock.
B000002UR7|5.0|This is one of my favorite rock albums of all time.  My favorite Radiohead album is actually either The Bends or OK Computer, back when they wrote melodies and not just blips and bleeps.  But this album is just great, straight-up, rock and roll.  And it's really awesome all the way through.  So yeah, if you like good songwriting, get Pablo Honey.  If you like sound effects get newer Radiohead.
B000268QB2|5.0|I heard this band was good so I picked up the CD without having heard them. I was blown away.  Fantastic music and tremendous vocals.  Anyone would love their music.
B00005JKTF|4.0|Having not read Sebastian Faulks' book, I cannot compare the film with it. It seems it must have been a rather long novel, with lots of characters in it, and plenty going on. It seems the film attempts to stay faithful to the book, and so the impression one gets is that the director tried to compress a complex and multi-layered story into a couple of hours. <br />The story is good but very predictable bordering sometimes on caricature. But nonetheless it is all very entertaining and the actors are good. It reminded of the older 1950's and 1960's war  <br />movies, very far removed from the new and very realistic wartime dramas (\\"Band of brothers,...). <br />Certainly worth watching.
B00015TOCY|5.0|This CD has been on my list of all time favorites since it was released-on LP. The dense, intricate musicianship, the songwriting, the concept-all feel clever and hardly dated even after all these years. Tight guitar work from Phil Manzanera and the Portsmouth Sinfonia's violins pepper this recording with hidden surprises. Eno's lyrics convey just the right touch of world-weariness edged with sly humor. At the time of its release-Nixon's visit and the US' first glimpse of China-it matched up well with the image of China as a mysterious, somewhat inaccessible, ancient and strange land.    That Eno's recapitulation of the \\"wall of sound\\" took place well before the advent of the digital era-if I recall correctly his main tool was a pair of reel-to-reel tapedecks- is astonishing. Even more worth a listen on the cleaned up audio. About the only thing missing from the original LP version are the endless crickets at the end of \\"The Great Pretender\\" as the needle wound down around the plinth!
B000002AS3|5.0|Yep, there's nothing more to say.<br /><br />Except this.  Noel Gallagher is one of the most underrated lead-guitarists ever.  All the solos on this CD are just amazing.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I was too young to remember much of the controversy that surrounded the release of this album. Upon learning more about this era in Madonna's history, I can totally understand how some large audiences were very turned off by the controversial picture book that came out around this time, now long, LONG, out of print, and the image that overtook her around this time frame.<br /><br /> Yet that does not affect how great her sixth studio album \\"Erotica\\" actually is.<br /><br />  Her rendition of the 1950s \\"Fever\\" ranks as among my favorite 1990s Madonna with its odd blend of early 1990s techno-pop beat, austere melodic atmosphere, and jazzy textures laced throughout. My favorite song though is \\"Rain\\" with it's beautiful mix of sunny melody and stormy atmosphere all mixed into one. Simply put, this is a marvelous album that although I can understand why some would avoid it, it is still among her best albums to date.
B00004XONN|3.0|<br />I love pitchfork. I love the way thier reviewers just say whatever the hell they want. The way they put down bands that others dont have the balls to criticize, like Jet. In my endless search for good music, thier reviews never help, but always entertain me. <br /> <br />Today i noticed they had another top 100 albums list up, for 2000-2004. As i was going through it i remembered that glowing review they had for Radioheads Kid A, one of the few i just had to disagree with, and i just hoped for all that is good about music, that it wouldnt get number 1. But sure enough, there it was, just like its predeccessor was last decade. And you know wat, at the end of this decade, Kid A is still gonna be there, because pitchfork are just a bunch of radiohead-worshipping dingbats, just like every reviewer here who has given this album 5 stars. <br /> <br />You want me to tell you wats wrong with Kid A? Mayb its the lack of effort, the emptyness, the three and half minutes of nothing that is treefingers, the pointlessness of in limbo, the annoying whiney chorus of idioteque, the anti-climactic mumbled dirge that is motion picture, or just the fact that none of the tracks on offer here compare to any of the tracks on OK Computer (excluding Fitter Happier). <br /> <br />Bottom line is: Ok Computer deserved album of the decade, Kid A deserves nothing of the sort.
B000003JBM|5.0|I was in college at Clark Atlanta University when this album came out. I thought the album was DOPE back then. I was raised on jazz and grew up on hip hop so this was a great album to listen to. For whatever reason most hip hop/jazz albums fail but this one worked...In the college circle this album was either rebuked or recieved luke worm..now this was the early 90's and that DAS EFX typ of rapping was in, hip hop was very closed minded at the time, anything done out of the context of hip hop at that time was rebuked...but coming from San Francisco we tend to have a more open mind to different vibes of music, this album was in the context of two of my favorite genre's of music. I will say this, Guru was really taking a risk with this album a HUGE risk with his fan based, but this album goes to show you that he was not a one dimensional individual. He was not some hip hopper that just stayed in cyphers all day thinking about lyric and stuff. Guru had a vision and he made it come to fruition. It has been...WOW...12 years since this album dropped and it has gained more influence and has been litteraly elevated to a classic, as it should be...IT IS JUST ONE HELL OF AN ALBUM...Jazzmatazz has aged like a fine French wine, the quality gets better over the years.  <br /> <br />This is a great album to enjoy whether you are a hip hopper or a jazzman...I will say this Jazz people need to stop acting like such elitist and realize jazz can be integrated in other musical forms...And Hip Hop needs to stop being such and elitist closed minde genre also. Hip Hop has gotten so commercial and watered down, it does not resemble the hip hop of 93'. This album show the best of both worlds...Good Job Guru...you were wayyy ahead of your time on this one...and he still is. I can't see this type of album happening today....
B000002MY3|5.0|It's hard to believe it was 10 years ago I first encountered this woman. In 1995 I was 10 years old and so far as I can remember although from a musical house I had no apparent interest in music. Morissette's '95 crossover success Jagged little Pill changed all that, whilst watching TV with my brother I saw a short TV advert for Alanis' album; I knew I liked it and had to have it. Being only 10, the thought soon disappeared and I forgot all about the angry white female. My brother in his infinite wisdom remembered what I had said and bought me the album on cassette for my birthday (Gareth I am eternally grateful). The album still remains in my collection, now in CD format of course (lost the tape). Its in my top three along with Damien Rice's O (which I also discovered in a TV advert) and Jeff Buckley's Grace (recommended by a friend). <br /> <br />Music is now a very important part in my life, and I can attribute my enjoying playing and listening to music to such artistic greats as Alanis, not to mention her partner in crime, the man who helped Alanis through this dramatic and truly worth-while cross-over Mr Glen Ballard. <br /> <br />Starting in with the harmonica and the \\"All I Really Want\\" riff the album persuaded me track by track to listen more and more, I did even onto the uncharacteristically quiet hidden track, the a cappella \\"Your House\\". The memorable Morissette style harmonies give me a warm fuzzy feeling, and the harmonica still creeping up in Morissette's more recent work is a welcome reminder of this talented lady's 1995 crossover success. <br /> <br />Alanis went on to a more calm and peaceful future progressing towards utopian calm in her most recent studio album \\"So Called Chaos\\", growing as an artist and distancing herself from the angry white female image that she earned from her 3rd album (JLP) whilst also creating a new reputation for herself as an intricate wordsmith (seriously- its hard to follow some of her new songs without a dictionary). Iam excited about the prospect of the 10th anniversary edition JLP with additional content being released this year (my copy has taken a beating since it has been played so much so I'm grateful for an excuse to get a new copy) <br /> <br />!!!This album is one of the all time greats in my view!!! <br /> <br />PS Alanis did NOT sing \\"Bitch\\" (I'm a bitch); that was Meredith Brooks on the album \\"Blurring the Edges\\" <br />PPS Alanis did NOT sing \\"One Of Us\\" (What if God was One Of Us) either; that was Joan Osbourne on the album \\"Relish\\" <br />-some people think she did so I'm just clearing up any confusion
B0002EXH54|1.0|Something went very, very wrong here.  To put it simply, the original thrash albums sounded great to begin with.  While they had some reverb, it never interfered with the music or diminished the greatness of the albums.  The worst case scenario with reverb, So Far So Good So What, actually helped the album and gave it very apocalyptic, heavy feel.  In every case with the originals, the drums, vocals, guitars, and bass were all evenly mixed and sounded appropriately heavy and thrashy.      However, these remasters/remixes sound digitized, processed, and aritificial.  Gar Samuelson's (RIP) drums sound weaker and flatter, especially on the Peace Sells title track, which now sounds laughable.  Even worse is Countdown to Extinction, where it sounds as if Dave replaced Menza's drumming with a cheap repeating drum .wav you would on a home PC program.  The new drums on Youthanasia are a disgrace.  Ironically, the Rust in Peace remix has the best drum sound, but with all the (horribly) altered vocals and added reverb, it's still the worst remaster out of all of them.    The increased bass mixes in with the guitars and really washes out the sound, thus leading to very flat, lifeless music.  That's not a knock against Ellefson though, as he's a great bassist.  It's the mixing.  There's something wrong with the volume levels, and many of the leads have lost their crunch.  They just sound lifeless.      The final thing that really ruins the album are the enhanced vocals.  With all due respect to Dave Mustaine, he's a very subpar singer from a technical standpoint.  And yet I loved the way he sang on the classic thrash albums, since he always sounded pissed off and brutally honest.  The raw production on the originals only gave his voice more character, and made it sound angrier and \\"thrashier\\" in general.    On all the remasters, the vocals are simply too overbearing.  Sure you can understand what Dave is saying much easier, but the overall effect is that the music itself suffers.  Now that the guitars have been cleaned up, the drums pushed back, and the vocals brought up front, albums like Peace Sells cease to sound like thrash.  They've lost their heavy and speedy qualities.  The instruments sound disconnected and artificial, and just plain goofy overall.  Parts of Good Mourning/Black Friday and a few other trash metal epics sound as if they were recorded in pieces.      Thrash isn't supposed to sound perfect and neat.  It's suposed to sound natural and loose.  If you must buy a Megadeth remaster for any reason, I'd recommend buying the post-thrash era albums.  They still sound worse than the originals overall, but since that music WAS intended to sound more commercial and \\"neat,\\" some of the songs do genuinely sound better.  The Architecture of Aggression and She Wolf remasters especially come to mind.      With all the terrible remakes and general revisionism going on in Hollywood today, you would think that someone like Dave Mustaine would know better than to remake his classic albums.  And yes, I do consider these to be remakes.  If all he did was remaster the albums, that would have been fine.  However, he chose to actually alter the sounds and instruments on these albums, thus altering the music itself.  The thought of future Megadeth fans being brought up on these re-releases is somewhat scary, because this isn't how the band was supposed to sound.
B0006399FS|1.0|We got ripped off again by this corporation ( former band called \\"U2\\" ). This album is ridiculous. With the overhyped ATYCLB, U2 were allowed into the mainstream in order to be \\"The biggest band in the world\\". Now HTDAAB is their biggest downfall ever. So commercial and lacks whole creativity. The CD cover is crap as well. The unnecessary copy of the whole ATYCLB formula really bothered me.  <br /> <br />The \\"songs\\" of this album are much less of a musically complex structure compared to that of their 90s releases spanning from Achtung Baby to Pop. Those albums where musical masterpieces and still to this day send a chill down my back and make my hair stand on end. This time U2 have failed to produced a work which would carry any significance whatsoever. Instantly forgettable stuff  <br /> <br />As for the lyrics, they're just made up of so used Bono confessions, thus I have a very sharp impression of its weak biographical message, plus some 100% meaningless and childish lyrics, as \\"Vertigo\\" or \\"All Because Of You\\". <br /> <br />From a band who really should stop now before they embarass themselves even further. Yet some brianwashed posers think it's fashionable to love every product named as \\"U2\\". <br /> <br />I don't recommend this sellout U2 to anyone. PLEASE U2 stop embarassing yourselves !!!!. <br /> <br />
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a genius for synthesis; in \\"Blink,\\" he weds the research of experimental psychologists to big, pressing \\"real world\\" problems, such as preventing police brutality, or making employment standards sensitive to an applicant's true merit rather than to, say, gender or race. For example, he reviews Claude Steele's research on self-stereotyping to explain how individuals sensitive about gender, race, or even height may have difficulty behaving in a way inconsistent with those stereotypes.  Or, he describes how how psychologist John Gottman has been able to predict with 95% accuracy whether a couple will remain married for another 15 years based only on their facial expressions observed over the course of an hour's argument.    Here's a great example of what I mean by synthesis:  he describes research on how decisions made in a very short time (split seconds) cause people to rely on hard-wired or stereotyped associations (say, between the race of a victim such as Amadou Diallou and the likelihood of the thing in his pocket being a gun).  The effect is exacerbated when people make decisions in groups.  Then, he carefully breaks down the events of the Diallou shooting - multiple decisions about Diallou's intent, threat, etc, followed by his shooting in a hail of 41 bullets-all of which took only 7 seconds total.  He makes a compelling case that Diallou's death was in part due to the close quarters in which the decision was taken (leaving only a few yards and a second or two between cop and victim), as well as to the number of cops having to make the call.  He even provides a tentative solution - police officers who patrol alone are less likely to get into this sort of trouble, because they are more cautious and give themselves more time to \\"override\\" these mistaken and stereotyped associations.    For the \\"layperson,\\" Gladwell makes lively and relevant experiments that would, if we read them ourselves, might appear obscure and clinical. For the psychologist (among whom I include myself), it's a bit of a thrill to see that hours of toil in a lab can have some real impact on how important real-world decisions are made.    I do have one very small beef with the book (it could hardly be smaller): I think the subtitle (\\"The Power of Thinking without Thinking\\") is misleading and undersells the book.  It makes it sound like lightweight self-help that is universally positive about the power of instantaneous thought.  In fact, the book is quite balanced on the subject of when and whether \\"thin-sliced\\" thought results in better or worse decisions.    More than anything, though, I admire Gladwell's taste:  he has a knack of identifying great illustrations, the great psychology that supports them, and making a crystal-clear connection between the two.  Again and again I found myself thinking \\"you know, a good experiment for him to illustrate this concept would be so-and-so's,\\" only to find that specific example on the next page.    I know of no journalist who commands the respect of social scientists to the extent Malcolm Gladwell does, and I expect this will be the average reader of \\"Blink\\" will feel the same respect for this fascinating book.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Al Pacino plays as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant whom arrives in Miami Flordia to become the cocaine king of the city and the most successful one at that. However, it becomes a living hell when he fights against the other mobs of the city, his sister having affairs with other men and his relationship with a beautiful woman named Elviria ( Michelle Pfeifer) is mixed when he's going out killing for Coke ( the drug, not the drink).<br /><br />This happens to be Al Pacino's signature role! this 1983 crime drama is a definite epic of the genre, it was trashed by some critics but made a decent box-office success and a huge cult following even among today's hip-hop stars. This is a brutal, gory and entertaining 3-hour tour-de force from director Brian De Palma that is definitely not for everybody but it's a must see movie and one of my top 109 favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />The new 2-Disc anniversary Edition DVD has awesome picture & great sound quality. It has a second disc which contains very good extras like featurettes on how the movie got from remaking a classic 1932 gangster flick, the casting, the controverseries on getting the movie a \\"R\\" rating instead of an \\"X\\" rating and how it became a cult classic, it also has a interesting documentary on how this movie inspired the lives of the popular rap artists in the music industry and a funny montage of how the theatrical release compares with the censored TV version.<br /><br />This movie is strongly recommended, definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\" Leon The Professional\\", \\" Kill Bill series\\", \\" Pulp Fiction\\", \\"L.A.

B00005JKJA|4.0|This movie is confusing at first (especially the last half-hour or so), though it is quite funny in some areas and erotic in others. It becomes extremely interesting and distrubing after a little thought and analysis. It's at least worth a rental--it's an interesting movie, but I don't know if I'd buy it. If you're having trouble coming up with your own interpretation, please check out [...] for some pretty good articles, before writing off the movie completely.
B0006IIPJ4|3.0|The movie was okay,but when I first saw the trailer I was blown away.But I noticed the scenes in the movie were far different than that of the trailer.The storyline about the Mystery Woman confused me.The special effects were good,but the storyline need some work.However I would compare the movie to a 1930's version of Star Wars,but as I had just mentioned,the storyline  needs some work.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|This CD is an interesting journey with many attention grabbing scenes.  The musicians are virtuosos who jam intensly while being able to produce very melodic passages. <br /> <br />However, the lyrics are rather lame and it needs more cowbell.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|A 12 year old girl named \\"Mathilda\\" ( Natalie Portman) is a troubled young girl in New York City as her family got slaughtered by an insane cop ( Gary Oldman), she stays in with her neighbor named \\"Leon\\" who's a professional assassin as he teaches her the methods of assassination to enact her revenge for the death of her family.<br /><br />A provocative and startling action-crime drama from The Fifth Element's Luc Besson, it's his first time of directing an American production. This movie also sparked the debut of Natalie Portman, it's a little risky role for Portman but was definitely a fine performance for her, Jean Reno is perfectly casted as the title character. The film is a little brutal but moving and thought provoking at the same time, this film has became a new classic in the action crime genre.<br /><br />The 2-Disc Deluxe Edition contains the Uncut international version with the correct title \\"Leon\\" instead of the original U.S. title \\" The Professional\\" with some never-before-seen footage shown in America, great Superbit picture & sound that is CD-esque quality and it's extras A 10 Year Retrospective documentary, Jean Reno: Road to Leno Feauturette, previews to other movies from Columbia DVD and a documentary on Natalie Portman as well.<br /><br />It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is a true action crime classic for every DVD collector to have.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Scarface\\", \\" The Punisher\\" ( Both versions), \\" L.A.

0778320448|4.0|In this latest \\"gal pal\\" book, Debbie Macomber creates four very different characters.  Lydia Hoffman is a two-time cancer survivor who decides to open a Yarn Shop as a symbol of her new life.  Jacqueline Donovan joins Lydia's beginning knitting class, but has a hard time fitting in with some of the other women, due to her haughty and superior attitude.  Carol Girard is a woman who is desparate to have a baby and she thinks that if she joins the knitting class and makes a baby blanket, that will be a good omen for her goal of motherhood.  Alix Townsend seems like a real misfit when she joins the group.  She is a tough young woman who has grown up on the streets and she is particularly prickly with the aristocratic Jacqueline.  As usual, Debbie Macomber mixes these disparate characters together and somehow manages to \\"knit\\" them together in a lasting friendship.  This is an enjoyable and easy read.
B0006L7U9W|2.0|It is unfortunate that such a movie with so much potential(see the six minute short included on the disc that was the genesis the director touted around Hollywood to get the thing made) had so little to offer when all was said and done.<br />The movie has a quite sumputous sepia toned look throughout,art deco buildings and even a late 30s P-40 Curtis Warhawk fighter plane complete with sharks teeth on the nose(the captains' preferred mode of transport).<br />However long on LOOK this movie is does NOT compensate for the stilted and see through plot that runs through this movie like so much water through a sieve.The science fiction pulp mags and 30s/40s serials that obviously inspired this movie had more depth and originality to them than this very shallow and cheap imitation.<br />Jude Law as the titular sky captain does as good a job as he can considering the material he has to work with and Gynneth Paltrow shows us once again why she is one of the top most wooden actresses in Hollywood today.<br />All in all this is one BIG disappointment;nice to look at but nothing under the hood.
0385510454|3.0|We're long time Grisham fans, despite the real duds he serves up now and then. In \\"Broker\\", we're reminded of some of the author's best story-telling books.  The plot is clever but not overly thrilling: a lawyer (Backman), in jail for conspiracy, gets pardoned and is swept over to Italy in secret by the CIA, as a ploy to get some foreign government who still holds a grudge to knock him off.  We then get some 200 pages of northern Italian travelogue (and language lessons) as Backman (now \\"Marco\\") studies hard and plots harder -- he is, after all, incredibly bright and resourceful.  Funny how fast this section of the book passed given the lack of much plot development -- a testimony to Grisham's writing skills.  In the end Backman returns to his homeland, in some glory, but then a dribbly ending rather spoils the fun by leaving lots of loose ends.<br /><br />We notice other reviewers were equally disappointed at the final chapter -- we just seem to want that nice neat ribbon-tying conclusion to top off the tale.  So we don't get quite what we want, but a decent Grisham yarn for sure awaits!
0679731725|5.0|Stevens, the narrator of this mesmerizing book, is an elderly (60+) English butler who has managed the same great English house for more than 20 years. In expression and action, Stevens is restrained, precise, articulate, and dignified, as well as masterful in crisis. These are all attributes that, in his own mind, make a butler \\"great.\\"<br /><br />Throughout his narrative, Stevens explores this question of greatness in his profession. This exploration can be summarized as the questions: To achieve greatness, does the family a butler serves have to be noble? Does that family have to take a public stand on the great moral issue of the day? What happens if that family takes a misguided stand for moral reasons and ends on the wrong side?<br /><br />In exploring these questions, Stevens tells us about the events, both great and small, at Darlington Hall that illuminate his battle for professional greatness. In doing so, he makes clear that the cost of this so-called greatness is impersonality, the suppression of emotion, and, ultimately, isolation and life as an artifact. Whatever the cause of this trade-off, the narrative shows Stevens choosing the security of relentless duty over family and love.<br /><br />Ultimately, Stevens tells a sad, compelling, and surprisingly touching story. And, it's clear Stevens is unlucky, with moments of greatness in his profession coinciding with turning points in his personal life. Clearly, the momentum of great events kept him from making good choices.<br /><br />\\"The Remains of the Day\\" is a tremendous literary achievement, without a word out of place until the very end. But then, Ishiguro has Stevens, in interaction with his old flame, acknowledge that his heart is breaking. And, the final paragraphs show Stevens accepting a role in life for rapport and emotion. Ishiguro, clearly, believes life without emotion is empty. But these positions represent a sentimental sea change for the troubled Stevens. Nonetheless, a great book!
B00030590I|5.0|I came to \\"Hero\\" expecting to see a critically acclaimed martial arts film. My attitude toward martial arts films might best be described as indifferent. I like some of them, but I'm not an enthusiastic fan. I only had to see the first few minutes of \\"Hero\\" to know that it was something special, though. The art direction and cinematography are so striking in the opening scene that I consciously thought that this film would be worth watching whether or not the story, characters, or fight sequences interested me. By the first sword fight, I was entranced by the film's beauty. When I saw the red and orange hues that followed, I thought \\"Hero\\" might be the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. And that was only the beginning. Director Zhang Yimou is one of the best directors in the world today...at making emotionally incisive, understated dramas. \\"Hero\\" is Zhang's first action film and, I think, his masterpiece. His characteristic depth and social insight are combined with the energy, history, and flexibility of the martial arts genre in \\"Hero\\". The result is larger than life story and characters in a film of uncommon beauty. Zhang has said that the audience will remember the images of \\"Hero\\" even if we forget the story. To say that he is right would be understating \\"Hero\\"'s visual impact. This may be the most beautiful film ever made, thanks in no small part to cinematography by Christopher Doyle and art direction by Huo Ting Xiao.<br /><br />\\"Hero\\" is a fable that takes place two millennia ago, during the era of warring states just before China was unified under its first Emperor. Qin is one of China's 7 states, and its King's sole ambition is to unite China under one rule. The Qin army's constant attacks on the 6 other kingdoms have made the King many enemies, however. Three assassins from Zhao have harassed the King for a decade, and he has promised riches and an audience to whomever defeats them. The reward is claimed by a Nameless (Jet Li) prefect, who arrives at the Court for his audience with the King. The King asks Nameless how he defeated the 3 great assassins: Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. So Nameless begins to tell the story of his battle with Sky (Donnie Yen), who visited his district, and his clever manipulation of Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) at the calligraphy school where they both studied.<br /><br />Many of \\"Hero\\"'s scenes have prominent color elements -red, blue, white, or green- depending on who is telling the story and why. The cinematography has to be seen to be believed. The fight sequences were choreographed by Hong Kong action director Tony Ching Siu-Tung. And martial arts fans will be pleased to see Jet Li and Donnie Yen reunited onscreen. The sword fighting sequences don't propel the story, however. They are well-integrated with the narrative and character development. And like everything else in \\"Hero\\", they are absolutely beautiful. You don't have to care for action or martial arts movies to enjoy \\"Hero\\". This is just a great film by any standard. 2000's \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" was the first Asian film to find a wide American audience. Its US box office was more than twice that of \\"Hero\\". I attribute that to hype. \\"Crouching Tiger\\" is a good genre film, but \\"Hero\\" is far superior. If you liked \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", you'll love \\"Hero\\". If you were underwhelmed by  \\"Crouching Tiger\\", you'll be overwhelmed by this film. Congratulations to Zhang Yimou for making a masterpiece that will be praised for generations. Don't be put off if you don't normally like martial arts movies. This is a sweeping drama that is punctuated by action. See \\"Hero\\" on the biggest screen you can find.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, storyboards, an interview with Jet Li, and a soundtrack spot. \\"Hero Defined\\" (23 minutes) is alternately narrated and subtitled in English.

B000001ABD|4.0|I really don't actually hear a lot of good, quality old school R&B anymore. Infact, most of the artists that are coming out like Ashanti and Fantasia Borino from American Idol trying to sound like they're R&B but they aren't. Yet, with all the acts coming out, I really don't hear anybody really interested in classic artists like Stevie Wonder. Since he came out in the 60's, he really has been and remained a constant in the music industry. While many artists have come and gone, his songs continue to be in retrospective as a living legacy that just keeps on going on.<br /><br />Song Review: Greatest Hits from 1996, is a very well detailed reflection of Wonder's career and his legacy. The vast number of songs also are greatly detailed from his standards like Do I Do, Part-Time Lover, Overjoyed and Signed, Sealed, Delivered and many more songs that reflect his career. The collection is a very well reflection. The collection has a lot of good songs, but there were like many other greatest hits collections, a few well put songs that were just overshadowed here on this collection like Isn't She Lovely, Go Home, As and so many others standards Stevie has made.<br /><br />While it is sad Stevie hasn't released a new record in a decade, his songs remain as universal in R&B unlike many other performers. This is a good collection, and is a must have for anybody into the wonderous wonder of Stevie Wonder.<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Remastering: A<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B0000931OG|4.0|I think the slow songs in this album like good song, sweet song and out of time are much better than the upbeat song. I feel that the upbeat songs make blur look like theyre trying too hard to be young again. I think this is one of their best albums
B0006B29Z2|5.0|It is very impressive how determined the boys were back in the day and what they have achieved. Seeing all the former Bandmates including Paul Di Anno talking about their time with Maiden was interesting at touching at times. This is a perfect Rockumentary about one of the biggest names in rock.
B000002UAU|5.0|Timeless.  Enigmatic.  No matter what the artists of today or tommorrow do, they will never create an album that is more groundbreaking than this one.  The Beatles managed to accomplish things that were believed impossible with this masterpiece. That they did it despite the technological limitations of their day makes it even more amazing and transcendent. <br />While it is not their best album (in my opinion that distinction belongs to Revolver, with Abbey Road coming next) it comes close.  Its just at times the music tries too hard to be psychedelic without entirely achieving the effect.  I think the experimental psychedelia of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" \\"Love You Too\\" and \\"Tommorrow Never Knows\\" are actually more sucessful in the attempt at trippiness.  That said, all of these songs are sucessful as pieces of art but the implied theme of the album breaks down somewhat.  \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" fills jarring and out of place with the rest of the material--it is the only piece of filler here.  Still this album is perfect--just not as perfect as Revolver.  My faves are \\"Getting Better\\" \\"Fixing a hole\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky w/ Diamonds\\" \\"...Mr Kite\\" and the magnum opus of this album \\"day in the life\\"--the eerilly delivered line \\"he blew his mind out in a car/he didn't notice that the lights had changed\\" never fails to give me chills--the delivery of those lines by Johns effect-drenched voice makes my hair stand on end.  I am told this line is about an English lord who dropped acid and then froze up in his car while at a stop light. <br /> <br />Now comes my real reason for writing this review when there are so many of this album: I just got distracted and had to give some praise to this album first.  Anyways some idiot calling himself \\"pissed of critic\\" called the Beatles rip-off artists and said that Oasis should sue the Beatles for stealing their style.  Angered  in one stance, but also wishing to amuse myself by his obvious stupidity I looked at his other reviews.  In one review of the Who: The Ultimate Collection he said that the drummer ripped off Dave Grohl of Nirvana and that this was a horrible debut album from a band no one would remember in five years. <br />So my question to you, \\"pissed off critic\\" is Do you huff gas before every review you write or have you just been hit on the head too many times?  Maybe you should actually try to know what you are talking before you go accusing two of the most legendary bands of all time of hopping in that time machine you mentioned and traveling into the future just so they could rip off contemporary musicians who never would have picked up an instrument without the inspiration of these musical heroes who came before them. <br />The Gallagher Brothers freely and blatantly admit that the Beatles are their main musical influence-they would be liars and rip-off artists themselves if they did not.  Before you try to write reviews of music you should actually try to educate yourself about it--In short don't write about things you know nothing about!
B000002J09|5.0|I don't really have anything to say, so I'll jump right in:    1. Black Dog - 9.2/10 A very good opener.  2. Rock and Roll - 10/10 Yes, it does piss me off that it has been in every single Cadillac commercial for the past two years. But it is a very catchy rocker that just plain kicks ass.  3. Battle of Evermore - 6/10 Many Zeppelin fans love this song, while I personally feel that it is rather \\"Meh\\".  4. Stairway to Heaven - 10/10 Overrated? Insanely so. Overplayed? Maybe. Great? You bet your ASS!  5. Misty Mountain Hop - 10/10 Another great rocker that is generally ignored or labeled as \\"okay\\" by most Zeppelin fans.  6. Four Sticks - 7.5/10 The album's filler track: nothing special, but still okay/good.  7. Going to California - 10/10 A great little acoustic diddy.  8. When The Levee Breaks - 10/10 Along with Kashmir, this is Zeppelin's best. A heavy, loud blues-rock song that is everything blues inspired rock should be.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|...but if you're looking for somewhere to start, this is the place. Pretty much all the familiar Beatles songs are here... \\"Help!,\\" \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Come Together,\\" \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" ect., plus a few lesser known classics like \\"We Can Work it Out\\" and \\"I Feel Fine.\\" The CD is almost maxed out as far as playing time, so you're definately getting what you pay for at a price that's practically a steal. <br /> <br />Another highlight of this disc is its booklet, which contains several single covers for each and every one of the songs, as well as details like the recording dates and how long they topped the charts. <br /> <br />Also, I must say that even though I own all of these songs on the Beatles albums and the Past Masters CD's, I still appreciate the fact that I have all of the songs on one convenient disc. This is a great buy for anybody.  <br />
B000063DFN|5.0|What do you get when you take what could be among the greatest albums of all time and throw in two filler tracks? Iron Maiden's Powerslave! <br /> <br />1. Aces High - 10/10 An excellent way to kick off the album. <br />2. 2 Minutes to Midnight - 10/10 An absolutly classic song that is an anti-war song, but probably not in the style of your typical anti-war song. <br />3. Losfer Words - 10/10 A great little instrumental. <br />4. Flash of The Blade - 9.5/10 A great song that is nearly identical to the next song as far as lyrics go. <br />5. The Duellists - 6/10 A pretty \\"meh\\" song that makes me want to cry, because I know that it is dragging down what could be one of the greatest albums ever. <br />6. Back In The Village - 7/10 [See \\"The Duellists\\"] <br />7. Powerslave - 10/10 A song that I thought was going to be about a 9/10 after the first 1:30 - 2:00, but it keeps building up and getting better, and by the end...it is a 10. <br />8. Rime of The Ancient Mariner - 10/10 An excellent epic song to close the album. <br /> <br />It average's out to a 9.1/10, but... <br /> <br />Overall Final Score: 9.4/10 <br /> <br />The filler does drag it down, but when you have such greats as 2 Minutes to Midnight and Powerslave it's easy to raise the overall score a bit. <br />
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This was awesome. I loved the theme song. This was to hilarous to even explain. WAY BETTER THAN SOUTH PARK MOVIE.
B000024D4R|5.0|I originally gave this a 9.4/10 which meant that I liked about 4 Floyd albums better than it. After listening to it again several months later, it's now probably my 2nd favorite with only Dark Side being better. Animals is also easily Floyd's heaviest album, which in this case is a good thing.    Pigs On The Wing Pt.1 - 10/10 A great acoustic opening song. It for some reason feels a little silly to give this a 10/10, but for it's minute-and-twenty-five seconds it is pretty much perfect.    Dogs - 10/10 One of Floyd's best songs and probably the best from this album. Gilmour's vocals and guitar solos are all top notch, and add to that some awesome lyrics including the fantastic \\"You've got to be trusted by the people that you lie to so that when they turn their backs on you, you'll get the chance to put the knife in\\". Some have complained that this track drags, and though about 2 minutes or so could be chopped off for the better, I'm not going to lower the score when the other 15 minutes are completely awesome.    Pigs(Three Different Ones) - 10/10 Awesome song with some angry biting lyrics. Highlights inlcude Gilmour's awesome guitar solo, in which he uses some kind of device to imitate a squealing pig.    Sheep - 10/10 Another fantastic track which has a cool effect where at the end of certain lines Water's vocals fade out and the synthesizer \\"picks up the note and carries it\\" so to speak.    Pigs On The Wing Pt.2 - 10/10 Pretty much the same as the first with a few different lyrics. Great way to close the album.    Overall - 10/10    A fantastic album from start to finish. You may be wondering how a \\"perfect\\" album (as in \\"every track is a 10/10\\") isn't my favorite from Floyd; Dark Side has more tracks and therefore more chances at greatness, which it takes advantage of: I'd give 7 out of the 9 tracks on Dark Side a 10/10, and as we all know, 7 > 5.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This is by far the best movie series ever. If you don't like these movies you have problems. I got this collection on christmas and I was thrilled. Critics crush these movies to badly. I loved the whole series. If you are a movie fan. You will love this collection. Go buy it.
B000002JSP|5.0|I know that I just commited blasphemy, but in my personal opinion ITTOD just barely tops IV for the title of \\"Zeppelin's Best\\" <br /> <br />1.

Fool In The Rain - 10/10 One of Zeppelin's softer non-ballads, but still a great song.   <br />4. Hot Dog - 7.3/10 I guess I'll forgive this album for having one track that's not up to par. Just think of it as this album's \\"Four Sticks\\"...or \\"Battle of Evermore\\". Oh yeah, it's basically Zeppelin doing country music. <br />5. Carouselambra - 10/10 I've heard some Zeppelin fans call this the worst song Zep ever recorded, and I've heard some say it's their favorite. I personally think it's an awesome song. <br />6. All My Love - 10/10 A great song that I think is about/dedicated to Robert Plant's son...who died.   <br />7. I'm Gonna Crawl - 10/10 Zeppelin were always great at closing albums. <br /> <br />Overall - 10/10 <br /> <br />Crucify me if you wish, but I personally feel it's Zeppelin's best. <br />
0385513755|5.0|Yeah yeah, it's \\"fiction\\", I get it. And, sure, in fiction referencing pieces of historical fact, you have to take \\"fact\\" w/a grain of salt or at least check out whether or not it's completely factual for yourself. But that's all besides the point! I loved this book! I was one of the people who paid little attention to the book's debut and a friend recently recommended it to me, so I went to the library (not wanting to invest money in purchasing it if it wasn't any good) and grabbed a copy. I loved it so much from the start that I was excited to purchase the illustrated version.<br /><br />Sure, the ultra religious are offended. Of course, critics point out any little flaw in Brown's research or interpretation. Again, it SO doesn't matter! Not only was this a plain old good story, but I learned a lot about the history of secret societies, art, math in nature - and it wasn't all from the book, but the book got me interested enough in all this stuff to do some further research (okay, so it wasn't hours spent in the stacks of a research library, it was Google searches, you caught me) on a lot of the information highlighted in the book.<br /><br />If this was a fictional book about a fictional painting by a fictional artist, no one would question it (well, the whole religious aspect might still have people in an uproar...). So, if you're looking for a page turner by a guy who is really REALLY clever, check out this book. And I highly recommend the illustrated version in particular b/c you get to see so many places that Brown references. It made me want to jump on a plane to Europe right now. Enjoy - and if you're concerned about the factual basis, do some MORE reading and check out that stuff for yourself. Whether what you learn confirms or contradicts what Brown says, at least you'll be learning something, right??
B000002KE2|5.0|Though most prefer Paranoid and Master of Reality, this album is, atleast in my opinion, pretty easily Sabbath's best. This album mixes heavy metal, hard rock, and psychedelia, and is one of the greatest albums EVAR! <br /> <br />1. Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener - 10/10 One of Sabbath's greatest songs. An almost psychedelic song. <br />2. Tomorrow's Dream - 10/10 Almost seems like Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener Part II. Another great song. <br />3. Changes - 10/10 Sabbath fans seem to be split on this one. I presonally think it's a great song. <br />4. FX - 9.5/10 A short little psychedelic instrumental. <br />5. Supernaut - 10/10 The best on the album, and possibly Sabbath's best.  <br />6. Snowblind - 9.5/10 <br />7. Cornucopia - 9.5/10 <br />8. Laguna Sunrise - 10/10 A great acoustic instrumental. <br />9. St. Vitus Dance - 8.4/10 <br />10. Under The Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes - 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Overall - 10/10 <br />
B00003CXXP|1.0|Though many might not agree, I feel this is one of the worst movies ever made and easily has the worst angonizingly prolonged unrealistic ending of any movie.  The last 20 minutes of the movie will have any intelligent viewers moaning in disbelief and saying \\"they couldn't possibly make that plot twist\\" only to watch even worse, more emotionally manipulative sequences transpire on screen.  I often rate other terrible movies by how many times I could watch them again before I could sit through A.I. one more time.  No other movie has a score lower than 4, meaning I'd rather watch that dreadful movie 4 times in a row rather than watch A.I. again.  I'd rather watch 16 hours of Jar Jar Binks doing a dance/song interpretaion of the U.S. Constituition than watch A.I. again.  Please save yourself from this movie and get something intelligent, like La Femme Nikita, The Professional, Brother of Sleep, Welcome to the Dollhouse, Croupier, Rounders, Little Voice, or American Psycho.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is truly Floyd's first album.    Don't get me wrong, Piper(8.5/10) and Saucerful(8.2/10) were good.    Atom Heart Mother(8.2/10) was good too, even if I probably never want to listen to it again(Not a lot of replay value).    More(9/10) was a great album, but didn't really help Floyd progress in any important way.    Then an album came along called Meddle.    This album contains what is arguably the greatest song Pink Floyd ever recorded, a masterpiece that succesfully blends the psychedelic-ish extended instrumental jam style of old Pink Floyd with the more radio friendly(but better) and more focused songs of the Dark Side era. Most Floyd fans seem to like this yet but it usually never gets higher than a 8/10 from most fans. I personally think it is underrated.    1. One Of These Days - 10/10 A great surging opening instrumental.  2. A Pillow of Winds - 10/10 Possibly the non-Echoes highlight of the album. A very light-sounding ballad that has a somewhat haunting edge to it. Listen to it at night, you'll see what I mean.  3. Fearless - 9.5/10 I've heard many call this the best song from this album, though I would disagree. A great song that sounds like it's building up to some kind of explosive ending but never reaches it.  4. San Tropez - 10/10 It's San Tropez, dammit. In other words I can't think of anything to type.  5. Seamus - 7.5/10 A joke song which features a barking dog as a backup singer, but it's short, forgettable, and kind of funny which keeps it from getting a lower rating.  6. Echoes - 10/10 My favorite Floyd song and also my favorite song of all time. Probably Gilmour's best vocals, possibly the best overall instrument playing I've ever heard in a song, an awesome \\"jam section\\" part of the song, plus a great little phychedelic \\"bird call\\" section that starts about half way through. It kind of serves as a blueprint for Floyd's next album, Dark Side of The Moon. It also synchronizes with the end of Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", hence the title of my review. However, I honestly can't accurately describe this song with words. You must, I repeat, must listen to this song.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop is not easy to digest at all, but if you let it sit in your cd player for a few weeks, it takes on a beauty, a stark, dark, dank, grotesque beauty, much like Miles Davis' Bitches Brew and William Burroughs' cut-up masterpiece book The Soft Machine. This album is not for everyone, and will alienate a large percentage of listeners who bought Achtung Baby and is expecting another 'One' or 'Even Better Than The Real Thing'. U2 was risking career suicide by releasing Pop, but their demise is highly doubtful, because this album is one of the most innovative rock albums in recent years, and U2 was a band at its artistic peak. True U2 fans adore this album. <br /> <br />A concept-album without really having a concept. Pop was TRULY new and refreshing in so many ways: unbeatable rhythms, revealing lyrics and songlines and lots of mystery. They were just brilliant. As John Lennon once sang: 'take off your mind ,relax and float down-stream'  <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|\\"Vertigo\\" is a clear indicator of how awful this album is. Bono - with the reluctant agreement of Adam and Larry  - decided it would be clever to release an absurdly radio-friendly single that had no melody, no rhythm, and an inane lyric repeated over and over. Video promo is even more stupid. Neverthless that garbage was N1 both in the USA and the UK... <br /> <br />There are too many stupid songs to be even considered U2. For example \\"Sometimes\\", \\"Love and Peace\\", \\"Species\\", \\"All Because Of You\\", \\"A Man\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", etc. This is an unimaginative album with the overdependence on Bono. He makes whatever he wants in this crap, he screams all over the place with his thin voice, he sings the same s**t once again, he does it everything. Dreadful Lyrics, horrible lead vocals. At least it's clear The Edge plays guitars...but the rest ? who the hell are Adam and Larry now ? I mean, every kid who has been playing guitar for 2 years can play better basslines than Adam. The same thing happen with Larry's drumming. <br /> <br />Where were you identityless hypocritical phony U2 fans supporting the band when this trash came out ?  <br />U2 lost their original fan base by releasing this overhyped mainstream bulls**t. I'd prefer that they never released this complete disaster. <br /> <br />This unlistenable monstrosity is tired, dull pop, the kind it gets worn out after a few weeks of radio exposition. A pity. \\"Species\\" is a collection of bad songwriting decisions. This doesn't even deserve the name of U2 on it. <br /> <br />Goodbye Bono, go sing your iPod/Super Bowl/Grammy you sellout ! <br /> <br />
0451196716|5.0|I read the long walk about a year ago, and while it amazed me to the extent that it was refreshing and unique, I was still unsure about it.  I recently read it for a second time about a week ago and realized how much I enjoyed the adventure that plays out for the main character (Ray Garraty).  Truely excellent.  I laughed, I cried, and by the end I was emotionally spent.  Great Read.
B000001EAQ|5.0|A truly spectacular album, with such songs as \\"Please\\", \\"Staring\\", \\"Discothque\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"Mofo\\", \\"Angels\\", \\"Velvet Dress\\", etc. Brilliant music, dense and dark. Pop is the last U2 complex piece of work. In this new century it's difficult to find music that is really creative. It's even harder to find a band that is willing to take risks, and expand their art. But those things can be found on Pop, a brilliant statement. <br /> <br />Electronic soundscapes, weird programmings and drummings, great beats, heavy and different guitars, etc. Pop is entirely different. Innovative, experimental, emotional, courageous, insightful. The 60 minute running time taken in on a cold winter night makes for a wonderful aural experience. This gem should have been the last U2 album.  <br /> <br />\\"Please\\" is the best achievement of this album. I don't know how to decribe it, other than it's brilliant! Bono's lonely vocals set back against a dark climactic rythm section and guitar and eerie keyboards can make anyone's hair stand up.  <br /> <br />Do you want to listen to the REAL immensely worth have U2 ? get this !!!. This isn't the easiest music at first meeting, but nothing great ever is.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002DKCMG|3.0|Ahh... an R-rated teen comedy... haven't seen those in a while. <br /> <br />This is just a stupid, silly, and often funny movie. If you're just up for some laughter and don't care about intelligence or are just looking for a getaway moment, \\"Eurotrip\\" may be a possible choice for ya. <br /> <br />Basically the movie centers around four hormone-driven teens out looking to get laid and party... but it also has a minor plotline interjected into their lil' post-high school graduation vacation. Our \\"hero\\" Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) had a rough high school graduation day since his girlfriend dumped him just after he graduated. But Scotty isn't alone for long. He's got a German Internet \\"pen-pal\\" that he writes to constantly. Scotty's buddy Cooper (Jacob Pitts) thinks that this German dude is just trying to \\"hook-up\\" with Scotty, who is convinced later on and sends a nasty e-mail to his German friend. Unfortunately, the German friend isn't a dude at all, but rather a \\"hot-looking\\" German \\"babe.\\" Now Scotty wants to go overseas to find his \\"true love.\\" <br /> <br />Two other buddies join Scotty and Cooper's getaway (eventually... by accident), one a guy named Jamie (Travis Wester) and his sister Jenny (Michelle Trachtenburg), both that're called the \\"worst twins\\" and Scotty and Jacob think Jenny isn't a girl. <br /> <br />Our characters run into trouble and the s**t hits the fan plenty of times. Of course, sometimes the laughs don't come out at all when jokes fall flat on their face or something is just God-awfully stupid it's just not funny... but somehow, you may still manage to chuckle out a laugh or smile. <br /> <br />Perhaps I had an enjoyable day when I watched this movie, but it's the kind of movie that has so many mistakes and stereotypical remarks with some lame jokes that makes it so bad that it's actually worth watching. The actors and actresses pull off their parts well (particularly Jacob Pitts, who's character is obviously the best in the movie) and featuresnumerous cameos from Matt Damon to Lucy Lawless. <br /> <br />So if you're up for a getaway movie, maybe \\"Eurotrip\\" could be a consideration. <br /> <br />Oh well... at least there was a naked chick in it.

B0000004V2|5.0|The Stone Roses were one of those bands who burned brightly... and all too briefly. Thankfully their presence has been long-lasting -- the music of their self-titled first album still lingers long after the breakup of the band. They captured lightning in a bottle, even if their first album's musical perfection was their downfall.<br /><br />After the panoramic, rumbling buildup of \\"I Wanna Be Adored,\\" the Roses catch you with rollicking, infectious rock songs and psychedelic trips. While sticking to strong pop melodies and rock instrumentation, the Roses manage to experiment around a bit -- the delicate \\"Waterfall\\" is literally turned backwards and replayed, in a song that is almost as good as the original.<br /><br />The true rock rebellion shows in \\"Bye Bye Bad Man\\" with protests concerning French student riots (\\"Every backbone and heart you break/We'll still come back for more\\") and an acid-tinged anti-royalist song. Finishing up the unalloyed brilliance is the bitter, complicated \\"I Am the Resurrection,\\" and the melodic \\"Fool's Gold\\" -- two of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />The Stone Roses spread their influence far in this album -- there are soft ballad-like melodies, whirling psychedelic trips, and rock that rises, crests and slowly sinks. Expect your heartbeat to rise and sink with it -- because this music has a richness and depth that most rock music cannot even begin to equal.<br /><br />John Squire's guitar riffs are flexible and fluid; it sounds like this guy was reinventing guitar licks all on his own. His shimmering guitar riffs of \\"Waterfall\\" are truly magnificent. The deep basslines will drawn you in whether you like it or not, as will Reni's outstanding drumming. Everything culminates in a wild, dense psychedelic mass in the overwhelming \\"I Am the Resurrection.\\"<br /><br />Ian Brown's vocals are excellent; unlike many rock singers, he has genuine vocal talent. The writing for these songs is deeply vibrant. Sometimes the intensity is almost breathtaking, as Brown sings, \\"I am the resurrection and I am the light/I couldn't ever bring myself/To hate you as I'd like.\\" Ow, heavy stuff. But he is equally good with the quieter songs, sounding sad and a little pensive.<br /><br />\\"The Stone Roses\\" is an unforgettable musical experience.  A culmination of musical genius, this is one of the handful of albums out there without a bad track or a sense of monotony. Very, very highly recommended.intensity is almost breathtaking, as Brown sings, \\"I am the resurrection and I am the light/I couldn't ever bring myself/To hate you as I'd like.\\" Ow, heavy stuff.

B000002H33|5.0|This is Metallica's 2nd best CD.  And it's probably still one of the top 5 speed metal releases of all time.

0141439831|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.   <br />  <br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her.

B0002KVUKM|2.0|People said the Mummy movies were too CGI dependant, possibly true, but they never took it to the ridiculous extremes shown in Van Helsing. Leaping off Notre Dame, swinging across huge chasms on chains, fighting werewolves and vampires and not so much as a spot of blood to mess up the faux period costumes. Jackman and Beckinsale clearly know they're in a cheap B movie and try their damnedest to salvage something from this mess, but to no avail. This could have been a fun movie, but the director lost the plot and I doubt the computer graphics people even read it. Rent or borrow, but don't buy.
B000002J27|4.0|When Gabriel left Genesis almost everyone was ready to say goodbye for the band. They were wrong! Phil taked a leader's role, Banks continued his masterious keyboard playing, Rutherford and Hackett played very good quitar parts. Many people calls A Trick of the Tail the masterpiece of Collins era. I agree that this is a very good album but not classic. There are three terrific songs Dance on a Volcano, Entangled and Robbery, Assault and Battery. They all could be Gabriel's era songs because they are proge songs. Collins really sounds some songs like a Gabriel. He sings well but not so good than Gabriel because his voice is weaker and so variable. This album is group achievement but if you look credits, you can see that Banks has been involved in every song. A Trick of the Tail and Mad Man Moon he has done himself. Without his keyboard this album sounded very poor! There are some unbelievable and awesome keyboard solos for exemple. the last two minutes of Entangled is the most beautiful(not best) melody Genesis has ever cut. A Trick of the Tail don't offer so much melodies and surprises than Foxtrot or The Lamb Lies Down On Broadwaý but it can show Collins's era as it best. Touching ballads, hypnotic acoustic quitar sections, groundbreaking keyboard playing and outstanding drumming. If you are fan of Gabriel's era, you should listen to this because you can find many good moments on this cd. In my opinion, there are too much long ballads( Squank and Mad Man Moon) that eats musical force for this album. All in all, this cd could highly recommanded proge music lovers and Collin's era likers.
1878574590|5.0|This story involves major character development. Marv is character you will get to know & understand. I think that is something not very well done with most main characters in stories. Marv reveals & deals with his personal problems throughout the story. You have to like Marv, he has his own morals and his own way to live his life. He does what he knows how to do. He uses what he can to get what has to get done, done. He's not the brightest brick on the wall but, he is harder than the rest. Willing to put it all on the line in the name of love and, finding out the sad truth about the one he loved through it all. Marv is ruthless & on a mission that can only end one way. The villains are slick, evil, and and smarter than Marv but, even that won't stop him. Marv is a character that is running on pure emotion and, Sin City is the dark, corrupt, and extremely evil place he calls home. This book is Well worth your dollars. Unless you only want to read about Super heroes who fly and wear goofy outfits and fight super villains who are bound to lose eventually. Sin City is not your average comic book or graphic novel or whatever you want to call them. Sin City is dark place full of characters who will get your attention no matter how much you hate or love what they're about.
0671027387|5.0|Having started law school last year, I get very little time to read \\"fun\\" stuff. I had to take a break this week and read Deception Point, which has been on my bookshelf for a year. I wasn't disappointed. Deception Point is a fast read, with a quickly paced story and better-than average (for Brown) characters.<br /><br />Deception Point is unlike Da Vinci Code or Demons and Angels, but it is a well researched, scientifically interesting story about a meteorite that just might contain proof of extraterrestrial life. Intrigue abounds, with insight into the foibles of NASA, a Senator making a run at the White House, a famous TV-oceanographer, and a headstrong young woman working in the Washington D.C. intelligence community.<br /><br />Couple the interesting plot about the authenticity of the meteorite with an Arctic Circle setting and you've got a terrific page-turner that will most definitely keep you up late a few nights in a row.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one...
1594200106|4.0|Pretension is defined as an aspiration that may or may not reach fulfillment.  \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" aspires to literary fiction but, at least in its English translation, does not reach fulfillment.  It does, however, serve as a compelling melodrama, and a look at a Barcelona that is both familiar and a city out of dream.<br /><br />The characters are a mix of the broadly drawn, and the somewhat more nuanced.  The primary players are the slightly callow but charming Daniel in his coming-of-age; his father, the kind-hearted and wise owner of an antiquarian bookstore; and his father's helper rescued from the gutter, hiding from the law, in love with women, and dispensing comic advice to all and sundry.  These three flow in and out of hair-raising, comic, and over-the-top situations with family, friends, lovers, would-be lovers, villains, and the flesh-and-blood specter who may well be \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\"<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafron, the author, is in love with books and what they mean to other book lovers.  He tells a good story, takes many interesting digressions - in fact, there probably isn't a digression he hasn't taken - and enchanted me throughout.<br /><br />It's always interesting when a book goes through a translation, especially when the book is well reviewed in the original, and mixed in the translation.  \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" may be a better book than we will ever know, and, as it is, I recommend it as a light but very atmospheric read.

B000002UAR|5.0|The revolver is great. <br /> <br />I am a Beatles fan of moderate proportions, and have been introduced to all the major albums. This is my favorite. <br /> <br />Towering above other Beatles albums, and other albums in general, the Revolver eclipses and captures a monumental age for the Bealtes; It crystallizes and sustains a great period of maturity, where they shrugged off their pretty boy image and embraced their radical intuition. <br /> <br />This album holds some of the least streamline songs such as Penny Lane or other such songs, but in a reproachful sense this compliments the general attitude of the album, and makes the songs feel more personal. But besides the imposed feel of the music, the actual songs and arrangements are wonderful to say the least. <br /> <br />This is a great Beatles album to start you collection, or lengthen your collection. <br /> <br />Get the album, listen to it, and treasure it. This is the Beatles at their best.
B000002J1I|3.0|\\"Tormato\\" occupies a wrongly reviled place in the Yes canon.  There's no doubt that it's a disappointment after the string of masterpieces and near-masterpieces Yes reeled off from 1971-1977, beginning with the powerful \\"The Yes Album\\" and ending with the masterful \\"Going for the One.\\"  \\"Tormato's\\" low reputation stems mostly from heavy critical fire, the ascendancy of disco and punk, and - perhaps worst of all - the tomato-splattered cover, which many seized upon as a metaphor for the music within.    So it's somewhat surprising that over 25 years later, \\"Tormato\\" doesn't seem like such a debacle. Over half the songs here are worthy additions to Yes' 1970s repertoire. In particular, \\"Release Release,\\" \\"Future Times/Rejoice,\\" and \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" find the trio of guitarist Steve Howe, bassist Chris Squire, and drummer Alan White in top form, developing a kinetic symbiosis that would come to full fruition with 1980's \\"Drama\\". Two gentler songs also excel: \\"Madrigal,\\" a 2-minute piece for harpsichord and vocal that effectively showcases vocalist Jon Anderson and keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and \\"Onward,\\" a lovely ballad written by Squire.    The rest of the songs don't hold up as well. \\"Don't Kill the Whale,\\" despite a powerful message, fails to impress musically. \\"Circus of Heaven,\\" an earnest fairy tale, really belongs on a Jon Anderson solo album. \\"Arriving UFO\\" is a goofy attempt to capitalize on the sci-fi craze of the late 1970s.    Much has been made of the waning interest of Anderson and Wakeman; indeed, both would leave Yes after this album. Anderson's lyrics on \\"Tormato\\" lack the self-effacing humour of \\"Going for the One\\" or the lyrical majesty of \\"Awaken\\" (both from \\"Going for the One\\"), while Wakeman's playing consists mostly of rote scales and arpeggios, played with increasingly shrill keyboard sounds. Wakeman's synthesizers are mainly to blame for \\"Tormato's\\" dated sound.    \\"Tormato,\\" for all its shortcomings, contains enough moments of greatness to satisfy diehard Yes fans. It's underrated and undeserving of all the slings and arrows heaped upon it by the critics. However, it's definitely not the place to begin for new Yes fans, who should probably start with \\"The Yes Album\\" or \\"Close to the Edge.\\" Save \\"Tormato\\" for a rainy day.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Like many, when I first saw this film two years ago in theatres, I was not impressed. In fact I was down right irritated. I thought the film was stupid, boring and Ben Affleck was very irritating. Actually I disliked the film so much that I walked out on it.<br /><br />A lot of things have happened since I saw the film in it's previous incarnation. I started collecting the book under the pen of Brian Michael Bendis. I can not say how impressed I have been. Here is a  superhero I can truly identify with.  I like Matt Murdock because he's a working class boy who made good. But whom at the same time has not abandoned his roots and defends the under dog whether as Daredevil or as a lawyer.<br /><br />It was my love and admiration of the comic book character which led me to rent and Daredevil the Directors cut. I have to say that this is a MUCH better version from the first. Where I found the first one annoying and un-watch able. I find the DC much more engaging and true to the character.  This film is not merely the original movie with added scenes. Scenes have actually been taken out from first movie (ie. the bedroom scene with Elektra) new scenes inserted and scenes shifted around to make more sense.  I find that the directors cut enhances who DD is, a hero who looks after the little guy. As opposed to the first film which sort of was nothing but a grown man playing masked hero.<br /><br />I really think that the creators short changed the movie going audience with the extremely poor film version. Because I think that if they had released this one it would have pulled in a greater crowd and done much better.
B00008PX8P|2.0|I wonder if they used studio musicians to record the albums. Cause they never sound very good live. Maybe if they stopped hot dogging long enough to remember what they are playing.  I am a huge Zep fan. But I just dont get why they cant sound good live.
B00005JLWN|3.0|This film was a combination between The Matrix, Fight Club, Fahrenheit 451, and Blade Runner. There are heavy symbolic messages being thrown at you concerning religion, dictatorships, and the power of the human spirit. Equilibrium was a sci-fi film to the utmost degree. I say this because most of the time you can only cover these topics with a futuristic approach. This allows the director to give us, the viewer, a warning that unless we contain ourselves as humans, this may be the future that we will have to endure. I thought that the actors very well played it out, the direction was steady, and the action was powerful.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about this film is the story. I felt at times it was rushed and a bit difficult to follow. The basis of this film was to not show emotion, which I felt the actors did very well, but there were times when I thought they were showing emotion and guards were going to come and take them away, but never did. When Bale did break down, why were the other pedestrians of the city not surprised (again, was it because they couldn't show emotion). This is where I started grappling with the overall feel of the film. There should have been a must stricter balance between emotion and non-emotion. I felt that anyone could get away with anything, and with as many spies as they \\"claimed\\" being around the city, why were more people not picking up on this?  If Prozium was issued to everyone, why were there some in the city not taking the drug. Take Watson's character. She could have been utilized in a much deeper way, helping to bring not only Bale's character to the surface, but also others around them. I just felt that with this story, there were issues not being addressed and topics not brought out until a very suspenseful moment. I despised, dare I say hated, the scenes between Bale and his son. Sometimes he was calling Bale \\"Dad\\" while other time he was using the name \\"John\\", then there was the fact that there was a painting in \\"father's\\" office, making us question if they had to take the drugs as well ... hum ... there was just not enough consistency.<br /><br />Out of what I disliked and onto what made this film work. First, our actors. I have never seen actors give so much to a small film as I did with this movie. Bale was superb, ranking close to Keanu in his \\"Neo\\" role, as the gun-toting officer of the government. Even Sean Bean brought a human feel to this story about emotion. I especially loved Emily Watson. She picks the oddest roles to add to her resume, but simply put ... they work. The acting was only the tip of the iceberg, I loved the action sequences. They were fantastic. I am a sucker for the \\"bullet-time\\" style of fighting that was issued in The Matrix and I am always impressed when films use it better or add their own spin to it. Equilibrium was one of those films. The kata style gun fighting was slowed down when needed, or kept the same pace to show the power of the human wielding those powers. It was flashy, but not too flashy. Bale pulled these sequences off with the greatest of ease, only proving that he could be the next Hollywood action hero. The battle between Preston and Brandt was exactly what I was hoping for. While there were a couple of clich&eacute;s that riddled this film, there were scenes of power and originality that gave me more delight than I can wave a stick at. The battle between two of the strongest lasted just as long as I wanted. Bale was the best, and this film never strayed from that idea.<br /><br />The final topic I would like to discuss goes over the symbolic references in this film. Please, look closely and see if you can see the Holocaust references staring you in the face. The most blatant is shown whenever somebody is accused of showing emotion they are burnt in the incinerator. This is a direct reference to what Hitler did to the Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps. Then there was the supreme ruler that just happened to be everywhere people were. He was unavoidable. It reminded me of George Orwell's 1984 in the sense that \\"Big Brother\\" was watching those that would not obey. Toss in a pinch of the Salem Witch Trials and you have a little film I like to call Equilibrium. I think I liked this film due to the numerous amounts of references to our culture, yet that was what Bale and his government were trying to destroy. While they thought that our culture was being repressed, it was actually seeping through the seems. They would try to crush it in one section, but it would only cause more distress in another. The never won battle against the culture that helps make us the people that we are today. It was interesting to see a world that was scared of repeating the horrible deeds of their past actually create a carbon copy of the horrific deeds of the Holocaust. Their attempts at a utopia failed because the rulers and the people were afraid of whom they were.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that this film was not without flaws, but it did make a good impression on my mind. It dealt with an issue that is not explored enough in cinema because we embrace the theme in every movie created. What would a film be like without creating any sort of emotion from the audience?  A film full of emotional void being enjoyed by a couple that embraces it. Strange, weird, world that we live in!<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****rywhere people were. He was unavoidable.

B00008PX8P|5.0|I have to confess, I was as apprehensive as I was excited about this release. The Song Remains The Same, to me, is one of the most boring concert movies ever...and it came out before Physical Graffiti, so there were never and official live versions of that material before. <br />So, how excited was I when I heard the beginning slide guitar of \\"In My Time of Dying\\"???? <br />I have to say the Knebworth set was amazingly potent as well. It makes you sad to think they could have gone on forever if John Bonham hadn't died, and then at the same time glad they didn't have to try and survive the cultural wasteland of the 80's. <br />I'm really thankful for this set....and completely blown away. <br />What an amazing and legendary rock 'n' roll band Led Zeppelin was....and they live on in this DVD package.
B00005JNEW|3.0|Well, I read the book first and then saw the movie a few weeks later. The book focuses on the sociological aspects of the obsession with high school football, to the detriment of other things such as education, ethics, etc. The movie left out most of the sociology and kept the football. The movie was OK as a sports movie, but it was a big letdown to someone who has read the book.
B0006399FS|3.0|I'm suprised at all the anger I'm reading in these reviews. I have to say I would describe my feeling as relieved after hearing this one the whole way through. Sure, there is some definite crap here, but \\"Vertigo\\", \\"All Because of You\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Love and Peace...\\" are well worth the price of the cd. The only horrific songs are \\"Miracle Drug\\" (...freedom has a scent like the top of a new born baby's head...?...huh?), \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" and \\"Yahweh\\". So, you hit the skip button a couple of times....and take the cd off a song early. <br />Still, the last one I would put ON for 4 songs (\\"Kite\\", \\"Peace On Earth\\", \\"Elevation\\" and \\"Beautiful Day\\")...so this is an improvement.....it could still be a whole lot better, but I'm not going to complain. <br />For my money, the best stuff is pre Achtung Baby. The closer to War you get, the better the material..... <br />I love the old stuff that I grew up with, and I will always love U2. It doesn't mean I'll love everything they do - and I certainly haven't loved one of their cds from beginning to end since Achtung Baby, but I'm certainly not going to cry \\"Sell Out\\" or whine about i-pods.  <br />U2 aren't perfect, but they're still the best rock band on the planet.

B00002E23E|3.0|Every so often, I get an urge to rent this movie...and as hard as I try, I can help but nod off during \\"Dazed and Confused\\". I used to feel ashamed...and then I'd be talking to people and I realized I wasn't alone! <br />There are some truly great moments in this show (\\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" and \\"No Quarter\\" among others), but the poor camera work (very choppy and WAY too much time pointed at Plant's crotch), the dream sequences and the more \\"mainstream\\" song selection make this one a yawn-fest. <br />THANK GOD for the new Zeppelin set! A version of Dazed and Confused recorded when they were still interested in playing it!! <br />Much better than the version here. <br />This one is for avid, die-hards only. If you want quality and more album cuts, get the new one....
B00008BXJF|5.0|Each period of Crimson has an excellent album, one that hit a peak of creativity, songwriting and especially playing-In the Court of the Crimson King, Red, Discipline, THRAK and now The Power to Believe. This is one of the very best records that Crimson has ever come up with, regardless of lineup. Belew's songs are fantastic (i.e. lyrics and melodies-the group as a whole gets credited with songwriting) and his and Fripp's guitars haven't sounded this good together since Discipline. I could use a little less of the effects and extraneous noises generated by P@'s computerized drums, but his actual skill in playing the drums is excellent on this record. Trey doesn't play a traditional bass; he's atually heard from the bass range up to guitar pitch in many places, giving the instrumental backing a very dense sound. Get this one and the live Elektrik
1582432678|4.0|I picked up \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" because of the subject matter.  Not because it was about a killing spree at a high school, but because it was told from the viewpoint of the mother of the boy who killed his classmates and a teacher.  It puts a twist on the \\"common\\" Columbine-like story.<br /><br />The novel begins after the melee, as the mother, Eva, traces the history of her son Kevin back through his days as an infant, through all his apathy and wicked stunts growing up.  She tells Kevin's story in long letters written every other week or so to her estranged husband.  At first, this seemed like the actions of a crazy woman trying to re-establish her marriage.  But who on Earth would ever want to reconcile with a nagging, pretentious woman who uses long diatribes with $10 words to fault you throughout your marriage?<br /><br />Not until halfway through the novel was my interest fully grabbed and I didn't tire of reading another whiny letter from Eva.  Up until that point, Eva comes off as a pompous woman with whom I really couldn't relate...and really didn't want to. You later realize, though, that this perspective is probably the way Kevin viewed her and why he held such resentment for his mother.<br /><br />The story itself is a good example of the old Nature vs. Nurture debate.  Are people inherently born evil?  Or is it based on the way they're raised?  Although this novel doesn't answer the question, it gives credence to both arguments and can make for an interesting discussion.<br /><br />The ending of the novel is very dramatic and offers an interesting manipulation in events, which I appreciated.  At that point, I was absorbed into the characters' lives and actually wanted more.  I felt like a part of their \\"dysfunctional\\" family.  The characters felt real, with the exception of Franklin, Kevin's father, who resembled the \\"golly gee\\" Mike Brady from The Brady Bunch (the movie version, not the TV one).  It's hard to believe that Eva would ever marry such a naïve man.  After finishing the novel, my only disappointment (and boredom) with the actual writing was that the author used an overload of detail to tell what turns out to be an excellent story.  (My Creative Writing teacher would have scratched red lines through numerous sentences and paragraphs, as they seemed extraneous).  Less is more!<br /><br />If I learned anything from reading this book, it can be summed up in this one sentence: \\"You can call it innocence or you can call it gullibility, but [she] made the most common mistake of the good-hearted: she assumed that everyone else was just like her.\\"  On that note...don't watch your back, watch what's in front of you.ould ever marry such a nave man.

B0002SROSQ|4.0|This is strange album for me. Previous Nick Cave's albums were all different, but each one was in similar mood. This one includes two CDs and some songs I can listen over and over again, but some just put me off.  Nature Boy, Abattoir Blues, Let The Bells Ring, The Fable Of The Brown Ape are amazing and if you add The Lyre Of Orpheus, Easy Money, Supernaturally and Spell from second CD you will get one great album. You can hear the old notes, you can feel old mood from Let love In and a little bit from Neil Young music in Dead Man. I did not get other songs at all. They are nothing like I heard from Nick Cave and not in a good way.<BR>You might need to program your CD player to skip some songs or maybe rip good ones to mp3, but you dont want to miss it.
B00005JN4O|4.0|Having Johnny Depp protray the beloved author, James Barrie, was just pure genius.  Although, after I learned more truth about Barrie's life, I was a little discouraged about the story. However, I can honestly say that I can look past that, especially with the brilliant acting that Depp brought to the movie. When you're watching the movie you are not seeing Johnny Depp, you're watching John Barrie. That's how good he is.<br /><br />While I was watching I don't think that I once thought 'I wonder how they did this.' The ensemble cast is brilliant.Kate Winslet as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies was a great choice and wonderful to watch alongside Depp. Her role is very real and moving. The little boys also did a fantastic job acting with their bigger-than-life a-list actors. Dustin Hoffman was Barrie's play director and friend, Charles Frohman.  He had some wonderful lines and was great to watch on screen.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it's a heart-filled and rather sad movie, I say, 'Go for it,' and watch this film. It'll really make you want to believe in magic again and the dreams of a child.
B00006JDS4|4.0|I first saw this movie when i was 13 years old, my mom thought it would be the \\"one movie that could scare me\\" imagine her suprise when she watched it the next day and saw all the nudity. HAHAhAh  it was funny then and more so now.  The rape scenes are realistic to say the least, the plot is good, and the castration in the tub......at 13 it hurt me, now at 25 it still hurts to watch.  This is a must for PPL who like good old fashion GORE and some fake snuff filmesk scenes.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Few comic actors have the versatility as Robin Williams--perhaps Jim Carrey--but \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" is the purest example of his soft side to date (Okay, \\"Patch Adams\\" comes close, but it's somewhat sappy in spots). <br />    <br />   What possesed director Ward to turn an American Golden-Age novel into a breathtaking motion picture must've been divine; every aspect of the movie leaves the viewer in awe, from the opening to the closing credits. <br />   \\"Dreams\\" begins in flashback, where we see two strangers (Willams and Sciorra) vacationing in the Swiss Alps bump schooners, and find thier lifetime partners. <br /> From there we move to thier family, living in NYC--complete with heart-sick 11-year-old daughter (her pet labrador dies), and emotionally-torn son, who's difficulty at school causes Williams to withdraw him into home-schooling. Then, on a mild spring morning, an auto accident kills both son and daughter. Subsequently, Williams is killed in a freak car pile-up incident, and finds himself in heaven, with Gooding, Jr. and Chao as his angelic guides.  <br />He must save his painter/wife from the twisted (but--along with paradise--technically stunning piece of movie magic) hell that she has created in her suicide. <br /> <br />  Ward's direction throughout all, surpasses even that of James Caneron's, even if for only \\"Dreams.\\" One cannot watch this heartfelt film enough times, trust me. Williams' computer-riden paradise (actually his favorite painting by his wife, of the spot of thier first meeting) is a big highlight, but the entire film is a rollercoaster through an abstract heaven and hell that's truly unforgettable. <br />  Probably one of \\"Dream\\"'s most underappreciated facets is it's score, provided by master Michael Kamen, and adapted from a tune by the little-known innovational band Sigura Rose. It is Kamen's glorious thematic scoring that brings the truest vibrance to the love story and characters of \\"What Dreams May Come.\\" <br /> <br />Finally, the supporting cast provides stellar performances (look for Von Syndow as a reincarnated ex-colleague of Willams' character), even the children. \\"Dream\\"'s reuniting ending, I have to say is probably the reason this film brings me to flat-out bawling-like-a-baby, every time I see it. Do not pass this masterpeice up, it's worth it. <br /> <br />Saw it, LOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEDD it, bought the DVD (includes a nice documentary on the making of..) <br />---GIGI <br />

B0002IVN9W|4.0|This is a great CD but, in my book, five stars is all-time classic territory.  We're not quite there but, compared to the dearth of good rock music being released now, this CD is very welcome.  The music overall is excellent, gorgeous melodies, beautifully played.  But be warned, it took me a few listens to get used to Win Butler's singing.  And even then, there are too many spots where he's clearly out of his range which, at times, detracts from the overall impact.  But the quality of the songs and the playing is so excellent that it (mostly) overcomes this limitation.    Clearly, all the (deserved) critical hooplah about these Montrealers is based on the songwriting (the Neighborhood suite that carries the first half of the CD is incredible) and the consistent quality of the melodies.  I hope this eventually translates into mainstream airplay because the blandness of Good Charlotte, Linkin Park, and countless other soundalikes has turned me off radio completely.    Overall, this is a stunning first effort. For the sake of the state of rock music in the new millenium, I hope we'll be hearing a lot more from this band.  You're most likely to enjoy this CD if you like Roxy Music, Modest Mouse, Talking Heads, Coldplay (Rush Of Blood), 70's Bowie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|In a world where liberals are labeled \\"socialist\\" and conservatives \\"fascists,\\" a film like this is inevitable. What is so disturbing about it is the fact that it uses real footage. Yes, our president did sit there, a little cross eyed, for 7 minutes. Yes, soldiers representing the American people took pictures with bound Iraqi prisoners in an inhumane manner. Yes, that is an Iraqi child's arm sliced to ribbons. Yes, our sons and daughters are dying while the Bush twins wear fancy dresses. <br /> <br />Step back from Michael Moore and just look at the movie. He really only appears as a narrator and an interviewer, cutting his stunts from \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" down to one chuckle-inducing trip in an ice cream truck. <br /> <br />One thing Moore's detractors keep bringing up is the fact that he's wealthy. Frankly, this is a hilarious claim to make considering the fact that George W. Bush and his entire family is not exactly self-made. I think making money off of your art is much more noble than through your oil tycoon family. So what if he was born into a middleclass family? Most of Americans *are* middleclass. He made his money, he didn't inherit it. Isn't that the American dream? To rise through your own efforts? <br /> <br />You can't claim something is totally fictional when it uses real footage. I'm sorry but, YES our president SAT there. If you really want an un-biased look at the film, just mute whenever Moore talks. Listen to the president. Listen to the mother. Listen to the soldiers. That's America talking. <br /> <br />Frankly, I find it very odd that everyone who supports Bush has the time to write reviews here. I mean, you support the war. Shouldn't you be signing up? Or is that just for innercity kids looking for college money? <br /> <br />Then there's the Christian approach. Hooray for you. The dirty homosexuals won't get married. But that won't stop them from having fabulous sex. But for some reason you still enjoy \\"Will & Grace\\" and give it excellent ratings, even in the red states... Hmmm. Unfortunately, history will not look kindly upon you, in the same way history does not look kindly upon those against the rights of minorities in the civil rights. So there's a big \\"f you\\" from your grandkids. <br /> <br />And hey...Do you really think Jesus would be happy with the state of things? <br /> <br />Ha ha. Moore-on. That's funny. Have a cookie.
B0000033RY|5.0|Searching for obscure rock in the era I was born into, I stumbled across this gem of a band. CACTUS were an original, tight, hard rockin' juggernaut of a group who were on par with the rest of the 70's rock pantheon (ie Zeppelin and Skynard). In fact, their sound is akin to both those groups. Why they faded into obscurity is beyond me because every tune is a flawless heavy rock song. It's a shame really but to me this greatest hits collection is a time capsule, an archeological relic from the 70'S. \\"Rock-n-Roll Children\\" is an anthem if there ever was one, and should be a standard on classic rock radio and \\"Rumblin' Man\\" is a dense, killer track, evoking MC5's level of chaos and power. I like to think that when I was born these guys were rockin' out somewhere out there. It'd be a shame if they went unheard. Awesome road trip music, by the way.
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's book is a very lively read, although one of his central premises is somewhat contradicted. Yes, it's possible to hone your instincts so that you learn how to better anticipate things. However, that seems to happen by itself, not by anything on your part.  <br /> <br />In essence, intuition is the experience you have in your subconscious mind. When a veteran police officer approaches a potential criminal, he or she is using the experiences of many similar situations, most of which happen in a matter of seconds. But they still collect as memory in the subconscious mind. I would argue that you can't just make a New Year's resolution to learn how to use your intuition better. It takes life experience and a number of parallel situations to get to that point. <br /> <br />The case studies and vignettes in this book are very entertaining and cross a wide variety of disciplines. They make for a very fast read because people can relate to many of them. But don't expect them to teach you anything by themselves. Many people, however, could read them and relate to experiences in their life where their instincts have taken over. And this book might help explain how they got there.

068987474X|2.0|I disagree with a lot of what is said in this book regarding the signs of a man's disinterest in some women.  Truth be told, a lot of men actually have a concience, and their reasons for not calling may include (1) they are unsure of the woman's interest in them; (2) they are going through some significant problems and really are unable or unwilling to open up; (3) they have been burned in the past by women who use the same tactics outlined in this book, meaning the women they like are players.  This is the real world.  Some women have boyfriends and don't tell about them and lead men on.  Other women just want the attention.  Sorry, but it goes both ways.  Trust me, I have liked some women so much it hurts just to mention them, but I was unwilling to make a move because they were already going out with other guys, or the timing was flat out awful, because of problems in my family.  So the author just confirms a lot of conspiracy theories and ensures that women reading these book will not uncover a diamond in the rough.  Thanks a lot.

The is a dialogue-driven movie -- an astounding mish-mash of what you might actually say, wish you could say, wish others would say, and what you roll your eyes at. You will undoubtedly find new meaning for the phrases \\"thirty-seven\\", \\"berzerker\\", \\"happy scrappy hero pup\\", and the infamous \\"I'm not even supposed to BE here today!\\" The characters are all likeable and flawed, and to anyone who went to a public high school, you will surely recognize some of your friends (and enemies) in these characters. The insights they offer are crude and crass at times, but nearly always funny and memorable. <br /> <br />The big disappointment is with the bonus features. Kevin Smith truly made a masterpiece with this simple black-and-white movie, which is, by no stretch, one of the best movies of the 1990's. Unfortunately, Kevin and the other cast members seem so impressed with themselves that they just talk and talk and talk about how great they are. \\"The snowball effect,\\" which others rave about (I don't know why), is a waste of time. The cast interviews are merely a testament to how well written the movie must have been to succeed despite only having two people (Dante and Veronica) who know how to act. Smith and his admiring cast drone on about how great this movie was, how great being a slacker was, how cool they were when they were high, how great blah blah blah. You learn what huge egos everyone has, and how greatly impressed they all are with themselves. They spend lots of time stroking their own and each others pride, but you are never really treated to insights about THE MOVIE! The extra footage and the extra features are huge disappointments, and the commentary tracks are just self-indulgent. Kevin Smith's mom says it best, \\"You spent $27,000 for this?\\" <br /> <br />My honest advice? Rent the three-disc edition. Watch Kevin Smith's \\"introductions\\" to various parts of the DVDs, and if you actually like it, think about getting the three disc edition. Otherwise, you can get the same movie on DVD (1-disc edition) or on VHS for half the price. The picture quality/sound quality is no different, as it's a low budget black and white film. Don't waste your money on discs 2 and 3, since you'll wind up using them for coasters anyway.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I went to get Michael Buble's CD  right when it came out and I wasn't disappointed! With his smooth voice, and the songs  he chooses to make to his own style, this a perfect album for a relaxing evening. He covers songs such as Beatles &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;A Foggy Day&quot; by the Gershwin brothers. Also, the instrumental arrangements for these songs are fabulous! Personally, my favourite song on this album is the last track. Michael Buble does a beautiful rendition of Stevie Wonder's &quot;You And I&quot; Ahh....gorgeous!! Everyone should get this CD, it's great!
B00005QG9J|5.0|This disc is one of the best albums to come out in 2001.  It's also quite a change from previous Incubus releases which is a good thing(ruts are bad).  The album is rather mellow overall, but the guys aren't afraid to get heavy one in a while(Have You Ever, Under My Umbrella).  There are some stellar, pardon the pun, tracks on here such as Just A Phase which is my favorite song they have evere done.  Are You In?, Echo, Circles and Mexico are stand out tracks as well.  I have a little advice for Aqueous Transmission: don't listen to this through headphones if you're tired.  It is so mellow and beautiful, it can easily lull you to sleep if you're not careful.
B000001FS6|5.0|This is one of my favorite U2 albums, which may sound odd since it is more of a soundtrack than a real album.  This cd contains beautiful live performances of classic songs from \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" as well as several other live selections.  All of the live performances are passionate, and even if you have never seen U2 live, you can imagine them performing on stage as you listen. <br /> <br />The \\"new\\" studio songs on this album are worth the entire cd.  Songs like \\"All I Want Is You,\\" \\"Desire,\\" and \\"When Love Comes to Town\\" have now become classics.  But there are also several other lesser-known studio songs on this album that are worth a listen as well.  Tracks such as \\"Heartland\\" and \\"God Part II\\" display some of Bono's most passionate singing and songwriting.  The only studio track that I don't care much for is \\"Love Rescue Me\\" - the rest of the album is so emotional, that this seems out of place. <br /> <br />The one downfall of this album is that because it is a soundtrack (to the documentary film \\"Rattle and Hum\\"), it does not flow or have a strong cohesive feel to it like a traditional studio album.  As a result, I would probably not recommend this one for new U2 fans.  Pick up an album like \\"Achtung Baby\\" or \\"Joshua Tree\\" first, but definitely come back to this one after you have explored other U2 efforts.  It will be worth it!  People who are unfamiliar with \\"The Joshua Tree\\" may also want to become acquainted with that album first since \\"Rattle and Hum\\" contains live versions of several songs from that cd.
B000268QB2|5.0|This CD is one of the best released this year. Excellent vocals, beautiful lyrics and very talented musicians make this CD an extra-ordinary listening experience. Perfect for a hot bath, cuddling with the one you love or singing along to in the car. You will not be disappointed! And if you have the chance, see these guys live. They put on a great show you'll remember for a long time to come.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the first CD from Linkin Park, formally known as Hybrid Theory, a hybrid of industrial, hard rock, rap, and techno to make a mix like no other. Each song is great, and I'll tell you about each one.<br /><br />1. Papercut - This is a fast paced, hard song that gives you a taste of what kind of album you just bought. It has a lot of hip-hop influence, as well other hard rock groups' influence. The lyrics are good, and the music is great instrumentally. 9.5/10<br /><br />2. One Step Closer - A very intense song. It builds you up with its great music to an all out scream of \\"Shut Up.\\" This song is probably one of their greatest songs because it shows all the pain they have built up inside them. All the people saying they wouldn't make it, all the people denying them of what they want, all of this just builds until this enraged solo by Chester. 10/10<br /><br />3. With You - This song was pretty good, I liked it. It isn't there best, but great none the less. Lyrically, its pretty generic, but either way, you will find yourself wanting to be in a mosh when hearing the song. 8/10<br /><br />4. Points of Authority - I liked this song, but not that great. The lyrics are pretty good, and the music is pretty good, but there is not much else about that song that sets it apart from any other AlternRock band out there. 8/10<br /><br />5. Crawling - A great song. It gives you a false impression of serenity, only for it to come crashing down in this song that really does crawl in your skin. This song deserves a screaming solo, but doesn't have it. Either way, this song is very diverse, and very good at what it tries to accomplish. 9.5/10<br /><br />6. Runaway - My favorite Linkin Park song, that's saying a lot, because they have about 40-50 songs (many are remixed). This song is very catchy, and very smart. I think the lyrics are very good in this song, and the music is very diverse and creative. A great mix, and overall, their best song (IMO). 10/10<br /><br />7. By Myself - This was an okay song. It doesn't stand out, but it isn't bad. I found this song very nicely written, just poorly executed, thus not receiving any prestigious awards amoungst me. 8/10<br /><br />8. In The End - With hip-hop influence, diversity, catchy chorus, great bridge, and an overall great balance, this is an excellent song. Not my favorite, but up there. This song is what convinced me to get the album 4 years ago, but got old after a while. Some say it sounds kind of whinny, but I think its fine. 10/10<br /><br />9. Place for My Head - Another somewhat hip-hop influenced song. The chorus is kind of weak, but it builds to a very nice intense part, that I like very much. I thought this was a great song, but others might disagree. 9/10<br /><br />10. Forgotten - Probably their best written song. There is so much symbolism that people won't get that actually makes it their most relatbale song. I found this song also very good music wise, and vocally. This is probably my second favorite song by them. 10/10<br /><br />11. Cure for the Itch - This is Mr. Hanh at his greatest. Although there is not real lyrics, this was a good instrumental song. It could have been better, but it was too slow, and doesn't really show a lot of work put into it, but eitherway is great. 8/10<br /><br />12. Pushing Me Away - The last song on this album. It is pretty fast, so it won't leave you with a nasty taste in your mouth when you are done with the album. This song was intense and good both lyrically and instrumentally, but like a few of their songs, not really memorable. 9/10<br /><br />Overall, this band has amazing potential, and an immensely large fanbase. This band will be here to stay as long as they keep pumping out an album each year like they have been. If you liked this, you might want to check out their Live in Texas album as well, mostly for the DVD, so you can see them perform 19 of their greatest hits live. I was actually at that concert, so I can assure you, it was great.can assure you, it was great. <br />
B000667FNI|4.0|First, a confession--I never was a Dead fan. That said, this is one fine album made better by DVD-Audio surround sound. The primarily acoustic instruments are well recorded (at the legendary Wally HEider studios in S.F.), and the layered vocal harmonies are gorgeous--a real surprise, given the Dead's lack of a standout lead vocalist. <br /> <br />And there's absolutely no fat here--no noodling solos anywhere--indeed many songs don't even _have_ instrumental breaks. The focus here is squarely on songwriting--mostly by the team of Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter, with standout turns by Phil Lesh, Bob Weir and Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan. \\"Truckin'\\" is the most famous tune of the bunch, but they are all good--and are made that much better by the 5.1 surround sound mix.  <br /> <br />Buy it--even if you don't have a DVD-Audio player, the DVD will play in dolby digital 5.1 sound on all normal DVD players--and it also sound very fine indeed!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Yes. I did rate this album a 5. I do like the fact that this is within the genre of \\"Rock Opera\\", but that does not mean that I am in any way comparing this to any of the past. If you have read any of the past reviews stating that there is nothing new on this album, forget those ideas. This is an album that speaks for post 9/11 American youth. For all those disillisioned with the current state of our society. Buy this album, listen to the lyrics, feel the anger, despair, and downright aggression. Enjoy it, and let it stand on it's own. Screw the music of the past. We live in the present.....or at least we should.
B0006399FS|3.0|This is the first full-length U2 release where you actually can hear the 'stitch marks' where verses, chorus & bridges/middle eight sections have been spliced together without fitting 100%. A prime example is \\"All Because of You\\", where the chorus comes up really lame, after a really killer 4 chord progression during the verses. <br /> <br />Other examples abound: the transition into the middle section of \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", the awkward bread before the high, chiming lead of \\"Miracle Drug\\", the bridge of \\"Original Of The Species\\"--it's obvious to these ears that the band is hitting the limitations of trying to sound like classic U2 while not simply retreading old songs--something every band with over 3 albums has to face. They have done a pretty decent job here, but it remains to be seen how well these tune will hold up over time. <br /> <br />The one thing that really makes the album work is the sequencing--Steve Lillywhite is really great at doing this. Which brings me to \\"Fast Cars\\", the bonus track for UK and Japan--it's great! And it is the only way to really close the album, deflating any pomposity of \\"Yahweh\\" perfectly, as the song's narrator wakes up hung-over in detox, plagued by ringing cell phones, e-mails and God knows what else. The track is mostly acoustic, with neat Arabic overtones provided by Edge's guitar leads and Bono's (perfectly thought-out) backing vox. Too bad they left it off the version most folks ended up buying... <br /> <br />Oh, and why, oh why can't U2 release this in 5.1 surround on SA-CD, instead of crummy CD sound? Come on, guys--it's time to get with the program--even Elton John is ahead of you there!
B000062XFG|4.0|Aside from a few clunkers at the beginning of the season, and one or two others later on in the set, it's amazing how quickly \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" found its feet in its second season, delivering consistently entertaining, mature science fiction entertainment virtually every episode.  The characters are more relaxed together (especially while interacting in the new \\"Ten Forward\\" bar/lounge set) and there are a minimum of those too-often used boilerplate Trek plots involving superior aliens who think humans are too savage to be in space.  Instead, the aliens are evil for once, as we get to enjoy the introduction of the cold, clinical but no less savage Borg!  The documentary materials are better organized this time out, too.  While we still get a variety of interviews with the cast and crew taken from all over the map (when the shows were in production, years later as they looked back, etc.), this time we're provided with the dates of the interviews and the context in which they were conducted, which really helps to orient the viewer and keeps the materials from becoming a confusing mish-mash.  This boxed set is a great way to catch up on these episodes again, or experience them for the first time if you weren't a fan when they were first broadcast.
B000002LQR|5.0|This CD is awesome. I don't know how I could have missed it. The songs flow together so well, I had to look at the display on my CD player to know that \\"The Power of Equality\\" switched to \\"If you have to ask\\". As with Californication, the CD has a mix of beatiful, melodic slow songs like the hit \\"Under the Bridge\\" and of the Red Hot Chili Peppers signature fast, take-no-prisoners funky rap, like the amazing \\"Suck my Kiss\\". The bass in this song is some of the best ever recorded. There is a little here for everyone. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy this CD today!
B0006399FS|3.0|I have been a fan of U2 since I walked into the local record store and bought an album called \\"Boy\\" back in 1980. I would consider myself a true fan in that I have loved some U2 songs and hated others - so keep that in mind if you continue to read this. When I first heard How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb I was extremely disappointed. I couldn't find one song that caught my ear. I hated the single Vertigo and couldn't even stomach the second single All Because Of You. I virtually wrote off the band (circa 2005). Then a strange thing happened. I was out on the town and heard \\"Original Of The Species\\" in a loud and crowded bar. It sounded different than I remembered it. It seemed to have a life to it, an energy, a spirit. For the next few weeks I have listened to the entire album more than a few times and I must say I've discovered something entirely different this time around. I actually like most of the album. Now don't get me wrong - I don't love the album but I like it. All Because Of You still bothers me (as did Elevation from 2000) but I am slowly discovering tracks that although pale in comparison to old classics like \\"Bad\\", \\"Out of Control\\", \\"11'Clock Tick Tock\\", \\"Gone\\" , \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" are still quite likeable if given enough listens. Tracks like \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"City Of Building Lights\\" \\" Love And Peace Or Else\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" and \\"Original Of The Species\\" get better with each listen. The track \\"A Man And A Woman\\" is so Un-U2 that it actually works. \\"One Step Closer\\", although not holding a candle to such \\"ballads\\" as \\"Drowning Man\\", \\"40\\", \\"Running To Stand Still\\", \\"Love Is Blindness\\" or \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" still renders some respect. Having been around for over 25 years and with all members in thier 40's U2 must be given credit for still writing decent albiet not amazing songs. Many of these songs will stand the test of time but it will take more time than usual for this to happen. All in all a decent release not worthy of the hype that surrounds it but deserving of a few more listens. Considering most of the pure and unadulterated nonsense that tops the charts these days U2's How To Dismatle An Atomic Bomb, although not even close to their best work still deserves a little patience.
0064407667|3.0|In my opinion, and based what I read in the first book, I would only recommend this book to children between the ages of 7 to ten. While conceptually the ideas proposed in the novel are interesting, the delivery is less then satisfactory. The dogmatic manner in which the author defines some of the simplest words can be quite maddening; granted it is a children's book, however I can't help but feel the author's persistent need to define marginally complex words excessive. The tone used by the narrator deadens any excitement that may be brought about by the character's circumstances. In response to some rumors of the impropriety of the engagement of the heroine to an older man, all I can say is that they are reading way too much into it. At any rate while interesting to investigate the nature of the book I would recommend C.S. Lewis, Nesbit, The Trumpeter Swan, the first of the Boxcar Children, The Judge, Eargon, Harry Potter, and even the Whipping Boy for re-read-ability. While The Judge: An Untrue Tale by Harve Zemach, and The Whipping Boy by Sid Fleischman are short stories, they did not win the Newberry Award for nothing.
6305252521|5.0|\\"The Truman Show\\" is a masterful collaboration between director Peter Weir, scriptwriter Andrew Niccol, and star Jim Carrey.  Though seemingly light in tone the film makes an ominous statement about our voyeuristic society even at the most mundane.  Niccol in his other projects has taken a fairly pessimistic view of society in his masterful \\"Gattaca\\" and the underrated \\"SIMONE\\" but \\"The Truman Show\\" is his most powerful indictment of human nature yet.  The film concerns Truman Burbank(Carrey) a rather affable fellow who lives a blissful life in the town of Seahaven with a seemingly perfect wife(Laura Linney) until he comes to the realization that it's all been a lie.  His entire life has been concocted by a television director, Christof(Ed Harris) and that his friends and relations are all paid actors.  Naturally, Truman's impulse would be to escape such an existence but there is too much riding on him to stay on the air and Christof will use all of his Svengalian powers to keep him in place.  Carrey gives probably his most effective screen performance to date evoking not only the comedy inherent in his role but also the pathos.  Harris, in a role that probably should have won him the Oscar, nearly steals the film as Christof.  His arrogance at Truman's attempts to escape from his power and the petulence he displays is masterful.  Linney is also effective as Truman's wife with the perpetual smile fixed on her face knowing full well that the cameras are on.  Natascha McElhone is also good as the woman who wants Truman to escape his stifling existence.  Great film but Paramount shows no respect for it by packaging it with virtualy no extras no speak of.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This movie combines the 1930s Flash Gordon serials with 1950s pulp sci-fi with a touch of film noir to create a uniquely timeless movie. The plot moves breathlessly from one cliffhanger situation to another, filled with gee-whiz gizmos such as laser-shooting robots, flying aircraft carriers, submarine planes and anything else you can think of. The characters are classic over-the-top heroes and villains. I loved the look of the film (I think the fuzziness, dim lighting and halos criticized by some reviewers here is part of the homage to the old serials) and thought it was great fun. I ordinarily despise CGI, but this film uses it wisely and to its advantage.
0553213105|4.0|Hours of tremendous enjoyment from reading the book. The incredible depth of the characters and the richness of the detail creates a wonderful read. However, should you find yourself lost in the middle of the forest with only matches and this book in your hand in dire need of light and warmth, don't hesitate to rip out several pages from the middle of the book, gather a few branches and start a fire... you thus will have the light to read by, and know the start and the end of the story. Resign yourself to the thought that the middle pages who thus furnished you and provided for your comfort were nothing more than the middling and confused thoughts of a swooning fop chaser.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|The initial scene of this exquisite 2003 charmer is narrated by Kirsten Dunst's auburn-haired Wellesley newspaper columnist, Betty Warren, who is as pretty as a rose, and just as thorny, especially in her criticism of those around her.   This is particularly true when a new and unconventional art professor from California named Katherine Watson, played by Julia Roberts, arrives at Wellesley College in the autumn of 1953.   Betty, whose tyrannical mother(Donna Mitchell)is the President of Wellesley's Alumni Association, initially resents the arrival of this \\"subversive\\" young teacher with radical ideas.    Directed by Mike Newell, the film's cinematography is periodically bathed in the golden light of nostalgia, and studded with an array of fine performances not only by Roberts and Dunst, but also by a charismatic Julia Stiles as the throaty-voiced, New England-accented Joan Brandwyn, the class leader, and Betty's best friend, Ginnifer Goodwyn, as the plump, friendly, accomplished cellist, Connie, real-life Wellesley alumni Laura Allen as the breathy-voiced, refined-sounding Susan Delacorte, and the willowy and unconventionally beautiful Maggie Gyllenhall as the stereotypically promiscuous daughter of divorced parents, Giselle Levy, who, like Professor Watson, is probably one of the most realistic characters in the film, perhaps more fully aware of certain truths about life and relationships that the strait-laced and conservative Betty will simply have to learn the hard way.   Marcia Gay Harden, who won an Oscar for playing Jackson Pollock's wife, is also featured in this film in which a Pollock painting receives attention. She plays the ettiquette Professor, Nancy Abbey, who like many women of her time has to present a facade of respectabilty in order to cover up the unpleasant truth  about her own status as a single woman. Interestingly we learn about her past in an in vino veritas moment during Betty's wedding reception. We also learn why Betty's wedding day ismore her mother's day than her own.   The male counterparts in the film are led by Dominic West, who reprises the role he had as a lying womanizer in \\"Chicago\\",  only this time as an Italian Professor. Beau Bridges' son, Jordan reveals that the acting genes haven't gone thin as Betty's uncaring husband, Spencer. One feels that Topher Grace as Tommy Donnegal,  and Ebon-Moss Bacharach as Betty's sweet cousin, Charlie Stewart,  the love interests of Joan and Connie, are destined for happy marriages. Their perfomances lend a certain winsomeness to the story.The reality of Betty's marriage is initially summed up by the single longing glance Betty gives a kissing Joan and Tommy as they visit her at her home.    Juliet Stevenson, a prominent figure in feminist theatre, has an interesting role as the closet case school nurse who is fired after one of Betty's editorials reveals her distribution of conraceptives, which at that time, were illegal.   Viewers observe the routines and rituals of a conservative women's college, as well as the chilly reception Miss Watson receives during her first class,and her challenging of her students'conventional views of art, especially when the fresh, rosy-faced young women respond to the sight of the Jackson Pollack painting.   We observe the growing number of clashes between Professor Watson and the faculty (led by Marian Seldes as a staid and icy President Carr) as well as Betty Warren, who will come to realize how silly she looks in the editorial photos in which she tries to capture the essence of a married Wellesley girl soon enough.   Miss Watson's daring sexual behavior would have raised more eyebrows in its time than it does 50 years later.   The costumes of the women are another point of interest in the representation of their characters. Giselle is often clad in rich, vibrant, if not jewel-toned colors and flesh-revealing  clothes, complimented by a necklace with a sensuous heart-shaped pendant, whereas the more conservative Joanand Betty wear conservatively colored, preppier and more modest styles complete with the inevitably prissy set of pearls.   The story itself has a lolling gentility that sharply contrasts with the theme of radicalism that it promotes. Ultimately the conventionally trained members of Wellesley's graduating class of 1954 will be inspired by their art teacher to shape their own destinies, wheather they choose careers of their own or conventional family lives, and while I would agree that this film is the obligatory girls version of \\"Dead Poets'Society\\",  its touch is delightfully feminine, and the graduating class' tributes to Miss Watson, both in their final class assignment and graduation-day salute, give the film a sunnier and more hopeful ending.
B000002UVZ|5.0|Who'd have thunk it? Just a few years into their career, REM teams up  with John \\"Cougar\\" Mellencamp producer Don Gehman and records a pretty tough, rocking album. Sure, there are a few quieter moments (the lovely folkish ballad \\"Swan Swan H\\" and \\"the Flowers Of Guatemala\\"), and the trademark Stipe vocals and lyrics are still there, but the band for the most part turns away from the Byrdsian jangle pop of their first few albums and creates a sound that is at once commercial, but just left of center enough to avoid being called a \\"sellout\\". The album starts  with a great guitar riff and the chugging, rolling rhythm section of \\"Begin the Begin\\", with one of Michael Stipe's best vocal performances ever, gruff and growling. Lifes Rich Pagaent also contains the now  classic \\"Fall On Me\\", their first hit single ( it barely scraped the charts, but it did make it onto MTV ). A few mid-paced country-rockers also hint at the overall direction of this stage of the band's career, and Lifes Rich Pagaent contains the first cover song to make it onto an REM album ( \\"Superman\\", which features lead vocals from bassist Mike Mills ). A Classic American Rock Album. Essential. And still my second favourite REM album. &lt;&lt;Thanks>>
B00068IOWC|5.0|Ignore the poor reviews on this page, they're probably written by people who listen once then decide. This album has depth, and takes a few plays to fully appreciate. But it's brilliant. Their best yet - yes better than The Joshua Tree. It's the sound of old U2 without the rawness. They've been at it so long now they've truly mastered the art of songwriting. It's selling in the millions, the tour is sold out - that says more than any review.
6304493665|5.0|Both Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon give the performance of their lives.  This is such an emotional film and the story behind it is amazing.  Tim Robbins' direction is spot on.  Was thoroughly entranced from beginning to end.  Although the story deals with death row and the death penalty, both highly explosive subjects, I was able to detach myself because of the actors' performances.  Strongly recommended.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|A behemoth is a large, beast-like animal.  These guys sure do live up to their name.  This is one of the greatest Death metal cds to come out in a long time.  The riffs are crunching, the vocals are deep and hate inspired.  From the blasting drums to the ripping solos, every musician on this record plays his role to the extreme.  There is a lot of charm that separates this from your everyday Death metal record.  For instance, the acoustic, folk inspired intro to Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth, the horn intro to Demigod, and it's not just the intros that add the charm, it's also the structure of the riffs.  Every element has been carefully planned out and exercised to perfection.  All in all, if you're into brutal Death metal, look no further than Demigod.
B0001LJC2K|3.0|What could be a great album is plagued with reckless overproduction, which either drowns out all the intimacy of the song or just washes a standout down so it sounds like the song you just skipped before it.  Lackluster and at times down right terrible lyrics don't help to distinguish one song from the other either.   <br /> <br />But this album is not all bad.  Younger audiences unfamiliar with a wide range of music may find this a little more accessible than say a radiohead album, which at times, but only at times they do sound like.  The production makes for a surefire radio friendly unit shifter, to quote a nirvana song, which they also at times seem to be unable to free themselves of musically.  This tendency to throw melody to the wind and almost edit in the overdriven guitars seems like something your friends would do in high school with metallica riffs.  Now this is done well on their previous album Origin of Symmetry but this release lacks the diversity and bluesy moments of the former.   <br /> <br />This is a talented group of musicians but their individual talent is only capable of shining through on either the loudest and most aggressive smashing pumpkins esq. song like \\"The Small Print\\" or when you hear the hind of a piano break though the cacophony of indistinguishable sounds. <br /> <br />Really if this album was produced in a basement for $500 I think it would be allot more interesting than it is now as this over polished and homogenized wondering of various influences.  While this is what Muse is about, unapologetically resurrecting their heroes of the 70's and 90's, the execution of this homage is what is lacking when you listen to this album. <br /> <br />A few of the stand out songs that don't fit well into the album thankfully are as follows. <br /> <br />Apocalypse Please <br />The Small Print <br />Thoughts of A Dying Atheist <br />Ruled by Secrecy <br /> <br />So the album as a whole is not worthless but I'm not sure I would pay full price for it.  Origin of Symmetry was over polished also and had problems with songs that just sounded downright bad but at least had brighter highlights that this album seems to lack. <br />
0671027344|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower was a good book.  I'm almost sure that it is because that everything that charlie went through was so easy to relate to.  The book is about exactly what goes on in high school and what goes on between high school age students.  The drugs, the sex, the alcohol, the parties, the secrets the mistakes that teenagers make, etc.  High school is all about learning and that is what charlie is doing.  All of his friends are seniors, so they are more experienced then he is and are into different things then he is.  He just pretty much goes along for the ride.  His two best friends who are brother and sister, Patrick and Sam, accept charlie and bring him into a whole new world.  Charlie has a crush on sam as well, which works out in a strange way.  This book has its up and downs, at times you laugh with the book and what is going on and other times you cry and just wonder why this has to happen like this.  Almost every thing a teenager has to deal with is included in the novel. Stephen Chbosky is a gifted writer.  The way that the nevoel is set up also adds to its greatness.  The novel is set up as letters to an undisclosed person, and the letters are mailed with out a return address, and with the names of the people in the letter changed so that Charlie could not be pinpointed and also to protect the secrets that he kept for his friends but included in the letters.  This book is absolutely not just for teenagers but also for parents.  I can not even find the words to say how great this book really is.  I am not an emotional person but I could not help but to let them show for this book.
B000005HO0|5.0|I'm a guy who usually doesn't like anything live unless I'm actually there, but Mayhem's \\"Live In Leipzig\\" is a great album. The production is not good, the instrumental work is pretty muddy, but it just works somehow. Also this is the olny Mayhem album with both Dead and Euronymous playing together. Dead is probably my favorite black metal vocalist, he sounds grisly and morbid and he just applies dark atmosphere to this band. I highly recommend this album to any Mayhem fan or black metal in general. <br />                      R.I.P. Dead <br />                      R.I.P. Euronymous
B000059TEQ|5.0|Today, romance movies and \\"tearjerkers\\" are usually too sappy, lame, hackneyed, and just not very good. But this movie, although it's now 35 years old, is  a \\"timeless classic\\", and it is just as powerful today as it was in 1970 when it was released. It's a refreshingly direct and simple story about love; about two people entirely devoted to each other. Oliver (O'Neal) is a \\"preppie millionaire\\" and Jennifer (MacGraw) is \\"social zero\\". They meet at college, fall in love, and eventually marry. After overcoming social barriers, arrogant parents (Oliver's parents \\"cut him off\\" after he marries Jenny despite their protestations) and poverty during the first couple of years of their marriage, they seemingly have it all. Oliver becomes a lawyer and Jenny no longer has to work tirelessly to provide the basic necessities, and the couple can now afford to start a family. But just as they had the world at their feet, they're rocked by the news that Jenny is, in fact, dying (of cancer). Indeed, it's heart-wrenchingly sad and touching, and it's a hard person who doesn't at least tear up at the sight of Jenny dying in her loving husband's arms. The movie hits all the right emotional buttons, and you share all the love and heartache Jenny and Oliver go through. O'Neal and MacGraw are brilliant and have great chemistry, and of course the haunting (and now legendary) theme music perfectly captures the intensity and feelings between the couple. Indeed, a true love story. And the best one at that.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Besides the typical Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, RATM and P.O.D. stuff that I had listened occasionally to in the past ten to eleven years of my life, Slipknot had just seemed too hard and hateful for my ears.  With Slipknot Vol. 3, which is coolly subtitled \\"The Subliminal Verses\\", I discovered Slipknot for the first time, throwing away all my former pre (mis) conceptions. <br />Being a bigger fan of the old school classic rock music (Steely Dan, America, Emerson, Lake & Palmer), I naturally fell in love with the quiet, acoustic \\"Vermilion Pt. 2\\".  I enjoyed its Pink Floydish sound during the chorus parts, as well as the lead singer's voice. <br />OK, 1 out of 14 songs covered...  So, not being a natural headbanger metalhead, I searched the CD to find songs I could feel with.  Probably my favorites are \\"Circle\\", \\"Vermilion\\", \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\", \\"The Nameless\\", \\"The Prelude 3.0\\" and \\"Danger -- Keep Away\\".  So, half of the songs on the album I can dig.  I really enjoy how Slipknot isn't just about endless screaming guitars and growling.  The fact that they actually have lyrics, that you can understand the lyrics and that their beats capture your undivided attention make for a choice band. <br />I do think I might purchase their first commercial release, self-titled \\"Slipknot\\", simply because I find the lyrics on \\"Surfacing\\" and \\"Scissors\\" quite impressive.  I guess my only wish for lyrics like these is that they would appear on non heavy-metal albums (like Jewel's first \\"Pieces of You\\", Fiona Apple's \\"Tidal\\" and Tori Amos's \\"Boys For Pele\\".
1400043662|4.0|Murakami does it again with Kafka on the Shore. He can take the most surreal experiences and make them seem so believable. The psychology of his novels is always the most intriguing aspect and this book joins with The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Hard-Boiled Wonderland as among his best.
0385510454|1.0|Grisham places an \\"Author`s note\\" at the back of this book in which he apologizes for knowing absolutely nothing about the subject matter. True, he doesn`t. If one takes this book as a \\"Grisham Standard\\" he has spent a lot of time blemishing his reputation. The plot is ridiculous,the dialogue unbelieveable. I say these things as a fan of his \\"lawyer books\\".      Grisham should have put his \\"letter of apology\\" as a foreword, or better yet on the jacket cover as a warning to recoil from any thought toward buying this book.    It appears to me Grisham cobbled this book together to pay for a vacation in Italy. He should have \\"stood at home\\".
B0002X314C|5.0|Looks like it's all been said by other customer reviews.  I just want to reiterate ... to paraphrase Kanye ... if y'all don't \\"buy\\" \\"John Legend\\" y'all stoopid!
B0006399FS|1.0|This lame album is the worst block of U2 music to date. Songs such as 'Vertigo' demonstrate that Bono was slipping into as he wrote song after song that was more suited for sell-out stadium shows than it was great music or great art. His lyrics are laughable. Just read what he is singing on 'Vertigo' or 'All Because Of You'. As irrelevant as the whole album. <br /> <br />U2 had always been about challenge. Not all four of them were the greatest musicians ever ( except for The Edge, who is - well... WAS a truly great guitar player ), but they always tried to push themselves just beyond their niches and into something new and dangerous. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb absolutely couldn't be more contrary. Everything about this album is flat and predictable as All That You Can't Leave Behind. Applying such adjectives to U2's music would have seemed unthinkable in the 80s and 90s. But hey, here we are! <br /> <br />U2 have become self-important yuppie-rock that make better magazine covers than albums. <br /> <br />
B000022TSV|3.0|I've seen two filmed versions of Carmen, this one and the Metropolitan Opera's staged production featuring Baltsa and Carreras. Of the two, I greatly prefer the Met's version.  It's not the acting and singing in the Mignes/Domingo version that I dislike.  Both are superb, with Mignes' Carmen's look and moves outshining those of Baltas' Carmen (which I find a bit distracting in a negative, non-Carmen like way).  The Met's staged performance is simply a better, truer overall operatic experience.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a good movie documenting the corruption of our president. I'd like to recommend a movie that is more important, though. It is 911 in Plane Site. [...] The movie shows suppressed video evidence from 9/11 that proves the government's   \\"official story\\" is ludicrous. EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS!!!   Please, check it out. Show as many people as possible.
B00005JN4O|5.0|This movie, in every shape and form, is brillant. It has some of the best acting by Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp. It has some great direction by Marc Foster. It has a interesting premise and has a great screen play. It is one of the most brillant films of 2004(and one of the best too.)<br /><br />The story of Peter Pan is a classic. It is about a boy that never grows up and has fun all the time and never takes on the responsiblities of a adult. He justs lofts around and has fun. J.M. Barie is a struggling playwright, his latest play has bored audiences to sleep. then J.M. Barie starts playing around with a woman and her children,and he draws insperation from those escapades for Peter Pan. But what he doesn't know that They end up becoming attached to each other, and it reaches a emotional peak. The play does well with both adults and children, but the woman that J.M. Barie loves is too ill to see it, so he brings it to her, and in one last beautiful moment with her, shows her Neverland.<br /><br />The film is, like I said, Brillant. I was in tears by the end of the movie, and I felt for all the characters. Give Johnny Depp the OSCAR!(Jamie Foxx too!). I think the Best Actor should be a tie. This film was great.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is obviously their most important/influential/trend-setting album that they created. The variety of sounds that had never been heard on a rock n' roll album were now happening. The harmonies of the Beach Boys(most notably,\\"Here,There,and Everywhere\\"/\\"She Said She Said\\"), the lyrical element of Bob Dylan(which was more prominent on Rubber Soul), and the influences of their heroes (Elvis, Buddy Holly, etc.) combined with their new physicadelic twist. Songs like \\"Im Only Sleeping\\", \\"Love You Too\\", \\"Dr. Robert\\", and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" are songs that influenced psychadelics in a profound way. 1967 would not have been the summer of love or the summer of psychadelic music without this record. The Zombies, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and Jimi Hendrix put out albums that are directly influenced by Revolver.  <br />  If I had to choose one of their records to own I might not pick this one. One reason being is that its a record that I usually skip through tracks on. \\"Love You Too\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" are songs I almost never want to hear. \\"Love You Too\\" is a very important song on this record in its influence and its a great risk that the group took. However, in its song quality its not all that special. Its a song that once you hear a few times you will lose interest in hearing it again. If you are like me you feel that The Beatles wanted to attract all demographics, which is a great thing. Every kid grows up on \\"Yellow Submarine\\" but by the age of 15 most people would rather hear \\"I am the Walrus\\". This song is one I may listen to on a drunken stuper but not in my normal state.  <br />  Sgt. Peppers is clearly when their phsychadelic sound came together. \\"Mr Kite\\", \\"A Day in the Life\\", and \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" is where the best lies. Not to mention all of the greats on \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". Sgt. Pepper is an album you can listen to from beginning to end 8 times in a row if you haven't heard it in some time.  <br /> Abbey Road is most likely therefinest album. Harrison is the key to the success of this record. He breaks out and writes two of the finest Beatles tunes ever and McCartney's vision of a medley to close out their recording career is simply brilliant. There isn't a song that I traditionally skip except Maxwell or Octopus at times. However, I think its the Medley that always gets me along with \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" which to me is McCartney's version of \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" in all of its musical changes.  <br /> Still, Revolver is a fine record and one I would't want to live without.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is a very unique offering because it has two conflicting poles of orientation one of which is done very, very well and the other which is haphazard at best. Or, if you will, the Force of Firefly is divided in to the regular Force and the Dark Side of the Force.  <br /> <br />The Dark Side of the show and the dirty little secret of the series is that the plot itself--and even the setting--was not very compelling. The episodes were very, very pedestrian if you boiled them down and stripped away the actors. A fugitive running from The Law stowing away on a ship? Who hasn't seen this before. A robbery (set on a train)? Seen it. Defend a house (of ill-repute) from villains? Saw it every week on The A-Team when I was a kid. A duel with an effete snob of a villain who desperately overmatches the hero in swordplay? Saw that in Rob Roy of all places... not to mention others. The gunfights are not particularly compelling nor are the fistfights. They occur, they're done moderately well, but they're hardly the groundbreaking action we learned from stalwarts like The Terminator and The Matrix. This is probably what the network suits saw (unlikely they bothered to watch the series). And they weren't wrong about this.  <br /> <br />But mother of all the gods did they miss the boat on what was so good about the show.  <br /> <br />On the Good Side of the Force is the characterization. The show is 100% driven by character. No one is watching these shows for the plot. No one is moved by events--rather, it is the characters in the events. People are watching to learn and understand more about Mal and Jayne and the Shepherd and most certainly River. Not to mention the others. The acting, in almost all cases, was superb and well-timed. They are all genuinely interesting. They live with you in ways that are important to all great works of art... they come to embody ideas and feelings that we all share. Like the series' title song, they get under your skin (in the words of one ofthe actors) and live with you. This is an exceptional compliment to Joss Whedon and the other writers not to mention the actors. Beyond doubt, the superb actors had the requisite sincerity to sell the audience on the work, which is desperately essential in any series like this. We watched the series because of the people. We don't remember the episodes, only what the characters said and did in the episodes.  <br /> <br />In fact, Firefly shares the most similarities with The Highlander television series. Like Firefly, Highlander seldom had anything interesting going in the way of plot. Every episode ended the same: swordfight with the bad guy, head cut off. Every episode!! It was the most stunning example of pleasantly enjoying the expected (this line from an elegy regarding Johnny Carson--don't remember who said it and would appreciate it if someone could tell us) the world has ever known. Yet Highlander was successful because the audience didn't care about the swordfights. They cared about Duncan. They cared about the Watchers. They cared about the motivations of these people and the things that they were doing.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM <br />
B000001EAQ|5.0|I love this album. The whole record is absolutely glorious. This album is truly their last work of art. After this masterpiece, U2 misses the point of creative artistic expression and evolution, pertaining to a much more marketable and consumer-friendly mainstream. What a pity!.    IMO, this is U2's last defining moment. A masterpiece of emotional exploration; Pop is not an album to be missed.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|TROY   is about the greatest battle ever fought-The Trojan War. It was fought because of a woman. In the movie, Paris, Prince of troy played by Orlando Bloom, falls in love with a married woman Helen, played by Diane Kruger, who was the queen of Sparta and they ran away to Troy where she became Helen of troy. Brad Pitt played the role of Achilles and he looked amazing in the movie. But I liked the character of Prince Hector played by Eric Bana. Hector's role was very different from the other characters in the movie. He was very kind hearted, a devoted son, a loyal husband, and a loving brother, and loyal towards his country. He did not wanted his country to go to war unnecessarily, that is why he even pleaded his brother to sent Helen back to Sparta not because he was afraid of war but because he did not wanted a blood bath. He tried his best but he couldn't succeed to settle the matter without the war.  <br />In the movie we saw what day-to-day phrases like Achilles' heels and Trojan horse mean.   <br />One should watch this nice historical movie. <br />
B0002YJ29O|5.0|First, I have to confess to a mistake.  For most of my life, I have steadfastly maintained that music is to be heard, not watched.<br /><br />Well, that position may be Logical, but it is not necessarily True.<br /><br />Consider this amazing DVD.  The first part stars Martha Argerich and Evgeny Kissin playing a wonderful piano \\"duet\\" by Mozart.  It is truly fascinating to watch the interactions between the older woman and the younger guy, as they perform flawless music!<br /><br />Then another piano is wheeled onto the stage, and four master pianists whomp it up with a piece by Smetana.  After a \\"Happy Birthday\\" piece, we are treated to J.S. Bach's \\"Concerto for Four Pianos and Orchestra in a Minor.\\"<br /><br />I could stop right here, and so I guess I should.  The world's greatest pianists, playing some of the best piano music ever written: well, it's just fabulous!!!<br /><br />In case you haven't guessed, I love this DVD!!  :-)
B00068IOWC|2.0|Same old same old from the next band to provide the soundtrack for a car commercial.  I'm so disappointed!  I was used to U2 providing me with fresh fodder with each collection they released.  This time around it sounds like more of the same stuff they presented the last time.  Oops, maybe cause that's what is.  Had some leftovers from 2003 so they repackaged it (thanks Steve), pumped it up with a big marketing scheme (thanks other Steve) and viola the public bought it.  Where can I get in line to return mine?
B000002J1B|5.0|In Songbook, critic and writer Nick Hornby's otherwise well-conceived compilation of his essays on popular music, a few sentences poke disparagingly at (among at least one other musical genre) progressive rock. (Beware, this book can end up costing an open-minded music lover much more than its cover price, as one attempts to investigate potential gaps it reveals in your musical knowledge). Yes was among those (...). The argument Hornby presented to support his point seemed weak and half-hearted, almost as if driven by a hidden agenda. Why categorically reject an entire genre out of hand?    I first heard and enjoyed Relayer over 30 years ago. The crowd I hung out with were scholastically apt jocks (wrestling, swimming, gymnastics) that happened to be heavily into progressive rock (ELP, Yes, Kansas, Focus). That defined the course of my early musical tastes until discovering the joy of the short, simple song construction and worn-on-your-sleeve emotions of New Wave in the mid 70s, along with the camaraderie of the pub scene surrounding that style of music and early forays into slam-dancing. Consequently, I dismissed most of progressive rock as sterile, pretentious doo-doo, and sold much of that part of my collection, never thinking I'd want to listen again. Rejecting this genre of music (admitting the hypocrisy of my earlier statement)... until the last few years or so, with the realization that the new wave / alternative musical vein seemed to have exhausted its creative possibilities, fusing with... progressive rock? The twain shall meet. (That also was true of some early new-wave bands, however: I often regarded Magazine / Howard Devoto as a kind of left-field, brilliantly twisted, new-wave Peter Gabriel).    Well, here it's 2005 and, thanks to CD reissues and sources for used vinyl, I find myself revisiting lost musical \\"old flames.\\" (...), I played Relayer straight through a few times last week and bits and pieces have been stuck in my head ever since!    Thereare aspects of Yes' earlier output that may have brighter moments (Fragile, Close to the Edge, Tales From Topographic Oceans), but, taken as a whole, Relayer represents the pinnacle of this band's stylistic evolution, creating something truly unique and immediately recognizable as such. Finally, there is the optimum instrumental interplay; everything melds into a creative ensemble without the showboating that, in my opinion, sometimes blemished earlier work.    In Relayer, no single musician or idea struggles to dominate the music. Even in the wilder moments, guitar and keyboards complement each other wonderfully, chasing each other over a sonic landscape, up and around a spiral staircase, collapsing and dissolving into a riotous yet fabulous cacophony, then suddenly coming back into sharp focus. Those crazy, \\"technical\\" bits are contrasted nicely by the beautiful, lyrical dreaminess of Soon and To Be Over. Relayer stands as a benchmark, one of the best progressive rock albums ever recorded.    Note (edit): the \\"reviews censor's\\" substitutions for \\"bad words\\" in the review (...) are comical. The first is a euphemism for pointing with a digit of one's hand. The second is the name of the book author followed by the execution method used in the Old West. :)
B0000931QR|4.0|the first song i heard was \\"Rosas\\"(sweet song) on HTV.After i heard this song i ran out and bought the album cus i was certain the other songs were good.I ain't disappointed by this album.I like the songs on here.Very catchy and very poppy.i only give it 4 stars though cus 3 tracks on here are a tad disappointing.the lead singer has a good voice.very soft but it flows with the music on here.My favorite is \\"Rosas\\".it's gotta be yours too.ive never heard their previous album(s)but i sure enjoy this one alot.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This film succeeds on several levels, the most obvious of which is comedic, which it does handily and indisputably. <br /> <br />However, it also raises an interesting philosophical question: Can someone really change, deep down inside? Can a glass-is-half-empty (as Phil's down-to-earth flapjack buddies posit) person become a glass-is-half-full person? <br /> <br />On the one hand, Phil's (a TV weather announcer played by Bill Murray) transformation from cynical, selfish and arrogant twit into his persona at the end of the film could be ascribed merely to having enough trial-and-error practice until he found the \\"formula\\" to finally, cynically, get what he wanted. Ergo, he did not change deep down inside: he just recited and fine-tuned the lines he had learned through his uncountable days of practice - just as he learned to be a piano virtuoso through the course of the film. Phil merely honed his acting skills - not his personality - while serving his sentence.  <br /> <br />It could be argued that Phil, being locked in prison as it were, had no choice but to change for the better: the consequences for him were far more pleasant if he simply went along with the change. The same theory used for reforming criminals. And that thought, unfortunately, takes away a bit of the sheen of his redemption. <br /> <br />On the other hand, and it's impossible to be certain without being inside the head of the screenwriter, but perhaps the intention was that the flaws in Phil's personality were genuinely healed by his experience. By being locked (via whatever unnamed higher forces) in Punxatawney, Pennsylvania until he finally got it right - deep down inside. A true transformation. One can argue, in support of this viewpoint, that his motivation for taking music lessons grew from a sincere desire for self-improvement, rather than trying to trick others. <br /> <br />This film is a metaphor for the reform and improvement of the soul. And it used the thematic device of a time loop,probably to condense the idea into the time allotted for a feature film. A real life transformation is no less plausible (but most wouldn't be interesting enough to develop into a screenplay). <br /> <br />If you agree with that premise, then you must also agree that it is possible to reform the (not too incorrigible, anyway) criminal. That the horrible venom spouted by racist Americans at the turn of the 20th century, surrounding, and subsequent decades isn't representative of today's population. That the jerk you knew 20 years ago in college, or even 2 years ago, could have become a worthwhile member of the human race. That it is possible to genuinely change inside, for the better (and, unfortunately, accepting that, on the flip side: for the worse, given the necessary stimuli). And that this scenario can be true of an individual - or a nation. <br /> <br />The next time viewing the film, try and keep this idea in mind, and decide: from the standpoint of the lead character, contrived or genuine transformation? I vote that the glass is half-full.
B00000IOSU|5.0|her music is very calm, sometimes sad, sometimes its love,and sometimes its a mixture of it all.but it goes well with her voice.this live album showcases her best songs from some of her earlier albums.i love ANGEL.it just makes me cry when i hear it because there's so much feeling and sadness in it.its just the way she does her music and you can't expect anything totally different from sarah but that could be a good thing too.her voice is really like an angels.its sweet,beautiful and hopeful.
B00029LNHS|5.0|The Black Eyed Peas are absolutely SPECTACULAR!It's unreal!What a pleasant surprise- real musicians, for a change! They are the most talented group of individuals to ever walk this planet in a long time. They're amazing singers, dancers, dressers, songwriters, the list goes on and on. There is not one mediocre song on this record, becuase each song is origial.The true gem on this record, however, is definately \\"Where Is The Love\\".I heard it for the first time, and it was as if all of my feelings were being poured out of a glass box. I could go on and on, praising this gift from God. Apl, Fergie, Will, and Taboo- you have a fan, right here!
B00069YE0W|4.0|I am a Frufan to the bone.   I am in love with every solo record he has produced.   Regarding Curtains and the 5 other records, Curtains is a wonderful record.   I don't believe it's as good as any of the others.   Many other are in love with this record and find this one to be their favorite so i know that this is just my opinion.   Curtains i think is the least interesting of all the the series.   My list of most to least would be <br /> <br />1. Inside Of Emptiness- Hardest and most rock of all the series <br />2. A Sphere In The Heart Of Silenece- Haunting Sounds and dark <br />3. The Will To Death- Pretty and Upbeat Songs   <br />4. DC EP- John without effects just natural guitar playing.  <br />5. Automatic Writing- Very experimental writing and very trippy <br />6. Curtains- Most acoustical and very personal and instrumentational <br /> <br />Curtains is good because for one there is a wide variety of instrumentation.   Piano, acoustic and electric guitar, melodica, stand up and electric bass, and drums.   that's wonderful.   Also one thing that you get in this record is more of a sense of John and his feelings.   With the other recordings, you get more music and experimentation cause of the music.   With this record, it's mostly john and his acoustic so all you can do is hear his words and feel what he says.   I do say that this record is a record that will take a few listens before you start to get in it's groove, but all in this is still an extrememly GREAT record.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I will be the first to say that the special effects for this movie were definitely top notch. It was clear that the budget for the movie was huge. That being said, there was a lot of things wrong with this movie. The biggest complaint I have is continuity. For example, in a ballroom with mirrors the crowd has a reflection. When the audience is told they are all vampires, they suddenly have no reflection.<br /><br />Van Helsing hops from one scene to the other quickly, hoping that the viewers won't notice. Weapons being 'out of ammo' when they are clearly not. People repeating the same thing twice. And I remember actually seeing wires and pulleys to hold dracula upside down. Several sloppy edits aside, the plot lowered my IQ. I mean come on. Mr. Hyde in Paris, Dracula financing Dr. Frankenstein, and we never did find out Van Helsing's 'big mystery'. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale did decent acting, but everyone else stank, especially dracula's annoying brides.<br /><br />To summarize: Laughable Plot, Bad Editing, No Continuity, Bad acting by the supporting cast, BUT.... good special effects.
B00005JL96|4.0|It is always a wonderful thing when Disney comes out with another Family-oriented flick. In Disney's \\"Lilo and Stitch\\", Disney goes where no other Family Network has gone before. This film is very conscious of social issues and it never shys away from family problems that so often plague us. Lilo is the little star of the show who lives solely with her sister. Between geting on each other nerves and trying to keep their little household together, an alien life-form, Experiment 626 (a.k.a Stitch), crashes into the hearts of this family and changes their lives forever.<br /><br />The film has both funny moments and serious ones. It is very heart-warming and (If-I-can-admit-it) it's also a mild tear-jerker. I believe older children will easily relate to its themes, and grown-ups alike.<br /><br />This film came right on time. In an age where kids are going up faster and are more knowledgeable, it is high time that many of today's animated family oriented tales feature more REALITY. This is definately one of Disney's best, hands-down, no doubt about it! There are no ghosts, no goblins, you don't even have a prince charming in this one (LOL); this film brings reality, comedy and wit all in one neat package. Besides the permanent presence of aliens, this Disney film is as close to reality as it gets.
B0000025RI|5.0|Over 50 million copies worldwide, seven top ten hits, two number ones (Beat It and Billie Jean), legendary music videos, and a slew full of grammies (Eight to be exact, out of twelve nominations).    Dang.    M.J. showed in his solo debut \\"Off the Wall\\" that he was going to be a force in the rock, pop, and R & B music industry without the help of his brothers (Evidenced by four top ten hits and two number ones). What no one expected was how BIG his next album was going to become.    Thanks can be given to Quincy Jones, Motown, MTV, and a strong group of collaborators, but the main thanks should be given to Michael. He is a musical prodigy, and that is proven here. The beats, the lyrics, the melody, the harmony, along with Jacksons strong singing and dancing create a phenemeneon never before seen in music. Jacko might be Wacko, but he knows a strong song when he hears one, and loads this album to the brim with hits. This truly is an album that can claim \\"all killer, no filler\\" status.    When it was released in 1982, it immediately attacked Top 40 radio stations. Listeners couldn't wait to hear a cut from Jackson on this album, as evidenced by seven (!) top ten hit singles. MTV immediately played the creative videos that the album launched, including \\"Thriller\\", which is still regarded by many as the finest music video ever produced. Clubs put the album into strong rotation, and soon the DJs couldn't get away from the requests that people had from this album. \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"P.Y.T.\\" all became club staples that can still pack the dance floors even today.    Remember M.J. back in these days? The performance on Motown at 25 special was truly spectacular. Wow, what a talent. The moonwalk, the soul he had in his singing, the range of his voice... he was one of kind, and he was a pretty good looking African-American to boot.    The album has something for everyone. Rock (Beat It), Dance (Wanna Be Startin' Something), R & B (Billie Jean, Baby Be Mine, Human Nature), ballads (The Girl is Mine, The Lady of My Life), and funk (P.Y.T.). The pickest of music lovers will enjoy this album. It has it all.    At over 50 million albums sold worldwide, it is still the top selling album of all time. M.J. might be in trouble lately, and pop music might be in dire straits, but that doesn't take away from this album. Pick it up TODAY. You won't regret it.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This is a sort of a music that you can't fully appreciate it in every occasion or state of mind... if you understand me. I couldn't believe THIS is a Stones album, for a huge but not old Stones fan like  me that was a shock: it is so strange, wierd that I loved it immediately! It grows on you... but remember: not for every occasion.
B000002UAR|3.0|Dump on my review all you want, but Revolver is not only the most overrated Beatles album.....it's also the most overrated album of all time.  From the whinny Eleanor Rigby to the annoying Yellow Submarine followed by the heinous pop of Good Day Sunshine, this album isn't groundbreaking in the least bit.  I will admit that John Lennon and George Harrison are both prolific, excellent songwriters, but The Beatles are by far the most overrated band ever.  Given the same time period, I would say that conceptually and musically, The Who was a much more groundbreaking band (the first concept album \\"The Who Sell Out\\" and first rock opera \\"Tommy.\\")  Bob Dylan, an influence on The Beatles, was also a far superior lyricist.  When listening to early Dylan, this album just seems so pretentious.  I don't want my review to imply that I think The Beatles suck, because I do like The Beatles.  I don't think that the hype is justified.  I hate the bubblegum appeal that Paul McCartney brought to the group prior to Sgt. Pepper.  If he was replaced by Eric Clapton and Ringo was prohibited from singing, the hype would be justified.  Forget Revolver, if you really want to hear The Beatles in top form, listen to Abbey Road or John Lennon's material from Rubber Soul and The White Album.
B00000HZHS|4.0|A lot of people i knew enjoyed a lot of the songs on this album,and my best friend and the girl i like both liked this album a lot,so i figured it must be pretty good.So,when i was on vacation in Florida,i saw a used copy of the CD and decided,what the heck?It was only 5.99,so it wasn't much,even if i disliked it. <br /> <br />First of all,this album is A LOT to listen to.Yes,it is only 12 tracks,but you can't get the full benefit of this album with only one or two listens.There are no pop radio anthems like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" or \\"Lithium\\" on this album,and it's like that for a reason.The group wanted to change there sound,because they had hated what they became.This change,in turn,was 'In Utero'.It opens with a bang with the excellent \\"Serve The Servants\\",which has several ironic lines in the beginning(teenage angst has paid off well).Following it was \\"Scentless Apprentice\\",a song with riffs that were completely different from anything heard on nevermind,but had excellent harmony.But it had Cobain screaming 'get away' in the chorus,just screaming.\\"Heart Shaped Box\\" was an excellent song,even with it's eerie bass line,Cobain helps with his lyrics that surely signify something great.\\"Waif Me\\" was originally titled \\"Rape Me\\",and is one of the BEST songs on the album,but one of the least credited.\\"Frances Farmers Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" is the only song on the album that will even sound remotly similar to anything heard on 'Nevermind'.\\"Dumb\\" is another song that broke the mold of there normal sound,bringing in a full set of strings to back the band up.\\"Very Ape\\" and \\"Milk It\\" are two more good songs on this album,with fast rythms and twisting lyrics.\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is one of my personal favorites,due to the slow speed but intense lyrics and guitar riffs.\\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" is ok,but due to the long static interruption in the beginning,it makes it my least favored track.\\"Tourettes\\" is the closest Nirvana could drift,in my opinion,from the 'Nevermind' sound.The song has Cobain screaming fictional words over guitars that match some light Nu Metal in modern music.Finally,it all closes with \\"All Apoligies\\".It's soft harmony but sludgy guitars make it an excellent song,but it does sound better acoustically. <br /> <br />'In Utero' is one of the most radical concept albums of the 90's,and Nirvana should be credited for it's attempt at something new.But this desire to produce a new sound did leave a gap between the 'Nevermind' fans and the fans who enjoyed 'In Utero' more.The songs on this album are harder,and more intense,just as Cobain's life had become.Where as Nevermind,it just showed a glossy punk record with an alternative lean.So,you must pick which you want to go with.If you are a real fan of Nevermind,you might not like this.If you leaned towards Incesticide or Bleach instead of Nevermind,this album is more for you. <br /> <br />
0446677450|5.0|This book is a CLASSIC all the way.  Years from now this will be recognized as one of the greats.  This isn't &quot;well written&quot; but it's message is POWERFUL that is why it is a NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER and has been for over 200 weeks, and I'm sure that it is going to hit 300 without any problem.  I truely feel sorry for the people that don't get what he is saying.<br />Robert Kiyosaki message is to tell everyone that there is another path.  Being wealthy is a choice, you can choose the path of his rich dad, or you can choose the path of his poor dad.  But it is  a CHOICE.  <br />This books goal is to show that being rich has a direct correlation with your financial intelligence.  To people that say this book doesn't give you a guideline for making money or that the title is misleading they just don't get it.  The title says it all. What the RICH TEACH their kids about MONEY... they teach their kids ABOUT MONEY.  They teach thier kids what an ASSET is, and how to acquire them.  That's it. Simple, but not easy.  <br />Robert Kiyosaki's goal is to try to educate people about the fact that they need to educate themselves when it comes to money.  It is all about increasing your financial literacy.  This book is just the beginning and he is just trying to highlight the fact that most people are financially illiterate, and most of the time not through any fault of thier own.<BR>  <BR>He wants to raise the financial literacy of the world.  That is truely a noble goal. I respect and admire him.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I must confess, I had fears that Michael Buble's 2nd CD could not do any better than his first. How wrong I was! This CD is absolutely incredible!  <br /> <br />Michael Buble has matured so much as a singer and crooner between these 2 albums. On top of that, the CD has amazing up-tempo beats which also includes that fantastic ballad \\"Home\\" which makes you feel next to Buble when he sings it.  <br /> <br />The arrangements are fantastic and very creative unlike some of the other cover versions I've heard. There's an especially great energy in the swinging tunes, which just makes you want to get up and dance to the beat! Dare I say that Michael Buble is fast on his way to becoming the next Quincy Jones!  <br /> <br />Also, I noticed that they took a lot more chances in this CD than they did in the last one, which makes this whole 2nd venture all the more fantastic.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD to anyone, not just Buble fans. You'll be swinging and dancing to the beats of the tunes in no time! Enjoy!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|What an absolutely wonderful accomplishment this album is.  I was really pissed when that turd Jimmy Kimmel made some joke about their age while interviewing them live over satellite during the American Music Awards.  This is a case where experience produced top-level music that many many bands can only dream of ever achieving at any age in their career.      This album can easily be compared to any of the great stuff they ever did, which is just about their entire catelog from \\"Then Play On\\" on.  The early straight blues stuff they did is relatively forgettable, but it undoubtedly helped permanently forge the top-notch skills of the world-class back-bone of the band John McVie and the inimitable Mick Fleetwood.  When Christine McVie came into the mix her lovely and phenomenal writing and musical skills took them to a new level which only got better and better and better as they evolved through various personnel.      I recently bought all of the CD's from Then Play On up to this album, except for a couple in the 90's that I completely overlooked at the time and don't know at all.  I think I will pick them up soon out of curiousity.  They are Behind The Mask and Time. But all the other albums are just priceless.  Future Games, Bare Trees, Penquin, Kiln House, Mystery To Me, Heroes Are Hard To Find, Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, Tusk, Mirage, and Tango In The Night.  Each so different from the other yet having such a related feeling.  They are so different because of the ever changing personnel, and in the later Nicks/Buckingham era because of the sheer genius at work among all the members of the band in creating ever new and diverse work.      I was devastated to see that Christine McVie was not part of this project, though she does make a cameo at some point evidently.  Though she did some of my absolute most beloved Fleetwood Mac songs, her absence in no way detracts from this masterpiece.  She is definitely there in spirit.      This album will just grow ang grow on you and there is so much you can sink your teeth into.  You will give it many many spins indeed, and it never gets old.  The opening guitar work on Thrown Down for example will gradually take it's proper place in your memory banks and become instantly recognizable whenever you ever hear it again.      This album feels like it was not really going for hits but was a magnificent expression of years of pent up creativity finally coming out and effectively captured.  Yes, it definitely is Lindsey Buckingham who pulled this baby off.  It's similarity's to Tusk, which is well-known to have been mostly a brilliant Buckingham production, clearly show he is to be given most of the credit for this gem getting made.  But that is just purely for the trivia lover.  It doesn't matter who is behind this lovely album.  I'm just so delighted it exists, and it makes me wish they will just keep on going forever making wonderful albums.      During the satellite interview at the American Music Awards Buckingham said they feel more creative than ever and this is some of the best work they have ever done, and I couldn't agree with him more.  This album, Tusk, Fleetwood Mac, and Rumours, are enough to put this man into the higest echelons of musical brilliance, along with the rest of the band.  Kimmel should have shown them the highest respect instead of coming off as the typical ugly American.      An absolute must own.    Over and out.  (The Professor recommends: \\"Songbird\\" off Rumours)
B000002LVB|5.0|If White Light/ White Heat is the epitome of VU's noisy experimentation - the absolutely end of the John Cale influence, Loaded is the on the opposite end of the spectrum, Lou Reed-led pure rock anthems.  That could send a lesser band into the irrelevance of commercial doom, but on Loaded, we find out songs with actual tunes free the band to an unexpected extent - we're given a barbed, invigorating, wildly original rock creation.  Whether it be the yell of \\"Head Held High\\" or the suave bravado of \\"Cool It Down,\\" the songs are composed with a sense of calculated abandon, a knowing defiance that makes even the most square numbers (say, \\"Sweet Jane\\") seem subversive and rebellious.  The climax of the album is \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin',\\" a seven-minute moment of guitar shredding so transcendent, you'll find your life too may have just been saved by rock and roll.
1567184855|1.0|Interesting ... but credible?  The described after death experience sounds like a wonderful college or university run according to modern ideas of teaching,  well staffed with wise teachers and counsellors, students encouraged to learn at their own pace, loads of experiential learning etc.  All very seductive, but his books beg many questions.<br /><br />For example, has Dr Newton published his work in any scientific journal subjected to peer review, where his methods of hypnosis and questioning etc can be scrutinised?  If so, it would be good to have the references cited in his books so we can if we wish obtain copies of his papers and judge for ourselves if his methods are acceptable and not leading or biased.  If he has not published his findings, why not, as he claims to be an academic, and publishing in peer reviewed journals is what academics do. And if what he is writing were to be accepted as credible(at least in part) by other reseachers his discoveries probably would have great impact and recognition.<br /><br />Have his findings been replicated, if so by whom, and have these replication studies been published in a peer reviewed journal of repute?<br /><br />How do we know the interviews have not been invented? They all sound suspiciously similar in the use of words and level of vocabulary etc.<br /><br />Why the first book and then a sequel? Why could not all the information be included in the first book? How were decisions made as to what would be included or excluded in the first book?  Was the second book just embroidery and further invention stimulated by the ideas and success of the first book?<br /><br />These are just some of the questions I would like answers to before placing much belief in what he is writing.  This is not to suggest Dr Newton does not have the answers - only that I have not heard them yet.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie was an unexpected breath of fresh air for me. As an avid fan of the book series I was more than a little disappointed at Chris Columbus' attempts at adapting them into film. The first movie had its charms--Daniel Radcliff was a wonderful actor for his age and evoked a great deal of empathy; the sets were colorful and the characters appealing. Dumbledore was spot-on. But it was nothing compared to the book. Just a cookie-cutter imitation. <br /> <br />'Chamber of Secrets' was appalling. Slow, stilted...too much time spent on dialogue to explain things rather than letting the audience draw its own conclusion. Too much added for the sake of a cheap Hollywood thrill. The scene where the Basilisk is blinded but \\"hears\\" Harry is ludicrous. Snakes sense heat and vibration--throwing a rock in the opposite direction would not have saved Harry from a serpent that was only inches from his face. This scene was NOT in the book and should have been left out of the film. The only good points in this film were the young actors--especially Rupert Grint who shone as comedic relief. <br /> <br />'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a far superior film not because it records every small plot detail that is in the books (something Columbus strove to do). That is impossible at worst...unnecessary at best. No, what Cuaron did was to capture the essence of the book; the spirit; the struggle of growing up and discovering that your world isn't what you once thought. This film cut out all of the unneeded parts (yes, yes, Pigwidgeon was charming, but did we really NEED him in this film?) and it kept to the point: Harry returns to school to discover that a murderer has vowed revenge on him--and that the murderer is his godfather who helped to murder his parents 12 years before. All that protects Harry are his wits, the skills taught to him by his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...and a series of hideous new school guards who may well do more to harm than to help Hogwarts students. <br/> <br />I've noticed that many of the negative reviews are coming from younger viewers--that the main complaint is that \\"important parts\\" are being left out of the film. Perhaps the problem is that some people don't realize that the real focus of the book was not Quiddich or magic spells--or even a murderer in disguise--but instead the minefield that is adolescence. For those who haven't experienced being a teenager I can see that it might be more difficult to understand the changes made. But for an older Potter fan--or anyone who just enjoys a slightly darker fantasy story--this film is a winner. No wonder J.K. Rowling has said it is her favorite film--and the most faithful to her vision. <br />

B00000K31V|3.0|eXistenZ is definitely a movie for all of you science fiction fans out there. It deals with the ever-looming threat of technology taking over human society. In this movie, Allegra Gellar, the gaming genius has just created a new virtual reality game that is being tested on a group of people. The world is already in a virtual reality craze, with the realists not wanting these games to take over real life. This leads to a violent war between the people. They want to catch and kill Allegra Gellar. Allegra and her security guard Pikul are  trapped in a game of Cat and Mouse, not knowing who they can trust and who is waiting for a chance to turn on them. The ending has a surprising twist, which leads the reader to seriously question if technology isn't slowly eating us away.  <br /> <br />The movie is very creative, like a bizarre dream that you just can't explain. Infact, the whole world of the game is surreal. It reminds me of when random things from the day are incorporated into your dream at night. It's also dreamlike in that when you wake up reality seems so comforting. <br />
B00006879E|1.0|The somewhat pleasant cover art does not befit the brand of sonic monstrosity that lurks within.<br /><br />Just when I thought that radio couldn't get worse, along comes this white-boy R&B/\\"soul\\" (yeah right, as if this audio abortion has one) pack of trolls that spew up some of the most turgid, wussy, 100% yuppie-and-corporation-approved crap since the latest Matchbox Twenty release.<br /><br />All of this album is terrible, but the main offender is She Will Be Loved... every time I'm exposed to that song (inevitably by some musically retarded and now very dead co-worker) it sends me off in a homidical rage. Who the hell thought that adding a vocoder-induced YODELING chorus to an otherwise insipid and cliched ballad would improve it somehow? How dare they?!?! Dozens and counting have lost their lives for this... this ATROCITY.<br /><br />My only hope is that someone the masses will wake from their MTV-induced slumber and purchase music that isn't the equivalent of having one's ears violated with a cordless drill. Until then, I will have to suffer countless club remixes and Kidz Bop versions of She Will Be Loved. Gah, the very thought makes me want to attack my computer monitor.<br /><br />Corporate radio, you have awakened my undying wrath. Be afraid.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Extraordinary. Pop was the work of a true genius of the experimentation. This album, like \\"Zooropa\\", is not very friendly at the first listening. But it becomes more and more hypnotic as you go on listening to it time after time.  <br /> <br />Pop is incomparable to U2's other works. This piece of art is nothing like what you'd expect it to sound like. It will take you some time to appreciate how brilliant it is, but once you relax and give in and allow yourself to enter their world. This is U2 at their best - difficult, inventive, moody, cheeky, bizarre, talented. <br /> <br />It's all so clever and addictive that I can't truly fault it. Sometimes I can't believe this was going on commercial release, displayed in music stores worldwide, millions of copies produced, because it was so honest and original and unlike most albums I've ever heard. I don't know. I love it. <br /> <br />
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell takes E.M. Forster's famous instruction, \\"Only connect,\\" to heart in this fascinating little tome. Around a few key situations--a marriage counselor who can tell in 15 minutes if a couple will stay together, a group of art historians who figure out in two seconds that a statue is a fake while the museum buying it spends 14 months convincing itself the statue is real, a musician whose music is adored by those who give it time but shunned by focus-group testing, a group of police officers who make a tragic, split-second error in judgment--Gladwell builds a narrative that never ceases to engage the reader. How are our perceptions of the world influenced by the calculations our unconscious mind makes in the first moments of any encounter?  Gladwell makes the case that these calculations can change everything, from who companies hire into positions of power (tall white men, more often than not) to the way we all know when someone's being insincere not by the words they say but the way our brain processes their facial expressions. <br /> <br />If this sounds like a lot to cram into a 250-page book that can be easily read in one day, it is, and that is the book's chief flaw--we're left wanting more, a lot more, about all of the anecdotes introduced during the book. Gladwell is a master storyteller, and while we're happy to float from one example to another with him, at the end of the book I was left feeling like I'd touched only shallowly on a great many topics about which I'd like to know a lot more. But then, if the worst I can say about Gladwell is that he's piqued my curiousity, that's some pretty faint criticism, isn't it? <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

B00062IVKI|5.0|This phenomenal achievement of the Scorcese-Minnelli-DeNiro triumvirate has never received the praise and appreciation it so winningly deserved.  \\"New York, New York\\" is one of Martin Scorcese's breeziest films and he displays a lightness of touch he's not typically known for.  The production values are first rate and the film fairly shimmers with the gleam of Old Hollywood from start to finish.  This rather glossy touch actually heightens the tension of the very human drama being played out on screen.  Scorcese makes this long film move like a short one with a camera that knows when to move and when to be still, and he coaxes the best out of his talented cast.  Liza Minnelli delivers her finest performance here and was wickedly robbed of an Oscar nomination because of the film's poor reception.  She's simply terrific in the musical numbers but, more importantly, she nails the emotional center of her character dead on and her quieter moments resonate with truthfulness and authority.  Minnelli is a much better actress than she's ever been given credit for.  Perhaps her rather quaint public persona and the endless travails of her personal life have distorted her talents in the eyes of the public.  However, she's nothing short of superb here and she shows in her musical numbers why she has always been such a riveting performer.  She has show biz in her very bones.  The rather unexpected pairing of Minnelli and Robert DeNiro is actually quite right, and their chemistry is unmistakeable.  DeNiro's later career has been a series of mannerisms and walk-throughs, but here he was in his prime and he plays his snarling and rather unlikeable character without compromise.  You can sense what he needs and readily throws away through misguided ego and unrelenting drive.  The qualities of these two disparate actors compliment each other repeatedly.  I especially like the scene in rehearsal where he spanks her and she slams down the microphone and walks out.  Short and sweet, but you get right away how much these two need each other but will never really work for one another.  Mary Kay Place does a brief, rather ditzy turn as a band singer, showing the comic elan that brought her attention, but this is really the two stars' show and they never falter.  Scorcese should be proud of this work because it accomplishes everything he set out to do.  It should be noted that his commentary is both insightful and entertaining, a quality often lacking in DVDs, and the other extras, while not plentiful, add to understanding this film's creation.  It will always be up to you \\"New York, New York\\".
B00006LIRI|3.0|I liked this CD a whole lot, but it still fails as a greatest-hits compilation.<br /><br />Five of the songs on U2's Best of 1990-2000 are alternate mixes than the familiar single versions. I actually greatly prefer the new mix of \\"Discoth&egrave;que\\" from the one on the Pop album, and the William Orbit mix of \\"Electrical Storm\\" is fantastic and puts the single version to shame. The fact remains, though, that they belong on the bonus disc, not the compilation itself. What I don't understand is if U2 were going to release a new single to promote this CD, why release the (quite different) version from the \\"limited edition\\" version of the album rather than the one on the standard release? Makes no sense. \\"Gone,\\" a song I never liked much to begin with, is also quite different, but I can't really comment on it. The new mix of \\"Staring at the Sun\\" doesn't seem to be too different; all I can really notice is more accentuated electric guitar. \\"Numb,\\" one of my favorite U2 songs, sounds better in the new mix, with the backing vocals more up front. Still though, all songs on a greatest hits compilation should be either album versions or single edits, not remixes.<br /><br />My other major complaint is song selection. I know that the album All That You Can't Leave Behind was still commercially warm, so that led to its under-representation on this album. But if you're just going to put two songs from it on here, why not the two most popular songs, \\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"Elevation?\\" \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\" is a good song, but it's no \\"Elevation.\\" And where's \\"Mofo?\\" \\"Lemon?\\" \\"If God Will Send His Angels?\\" \\"The Fly?\\" All of those have no reason not to be on this compilation. Maybe it should have been two CDs.<br /><br />I must say again that I liked the alternate mixes of these songs better than the originals. When I burn my own U2 mix CD, \\"Discoth&egrave;que,\\" \\"Electrical Storm,\\" and \\"Numb\\" will come from this collection, not their respective albums. But that doesn't guarantee you'll like these versions better, which is why this is somewhat of a disappointment.guarantee you'll like these versions better, which is why this is somewhat of a disappointment.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Wow. I bought this album last night because I saw some great reviews for it here on Amazon. People, believe what everybody is saying. This is probably one of the greatest albums of all time. <br /> <br />What matters the most is that every song has its distinction and uniqueness, each in a GOOD WAY. There is no filler crap here. Radiohead has composed a beautiful work of musical art, ranking up with another favorite album of mine by Beck titled 'Sea Change'.  <br /> <br />The best song on the album is so hard to pick, but I always find myself listening to 'Exit Music (For a Film)' the most. It's just so powerful, yet so quiet, until its climatic buildup that will leave you with goosebumps every time you listen to it. There is just something about that song that I can't describe. It's so haunting, yet so beautiful at the same time.  <br /> <br />Karma Police is another favorite of mine. Oh, and I can't forget Paranoid Android. Actually, Paranoid Android kind of reminds me of a modern 'Bohemian Rhapsody' because of its dramatic change about halfway through the song, when all the sudden a beautiful harmonic section that will probably leave you with goosebumps arises, then descending back into its heavy section. What's funny is that that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' starts off slow, has its middle section more up-beat, then comes back to slow. This song is just the opposite, but just as beautiful. <br />

1594200106|5.0|I loved this book.  I found the plot gripping and mysterious, the characters interesting, the atmosphere dark and convincing.  I couldn't put it down.  I like a good mystery and this a good one.  I guessed one of the main plot twists as well -- I think you are supposed to get that one early.  It doesn't detract from the suspense.  The characters held my interest all along.  The writing (and translation -- I read it in English, not the original Spanish) is crisp and clear and yet uses a quirky and evocative vocabulary to paint a strong picture without being self-consciously \\"literary.\\"<br /><br />The words that come from the mouth of Fermin are brilliant.  He's is the crazy, wise, over-the-top sage.  The parallels in the story are satisfying.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained about the plot.  What's not to like?  It's complex, intriguing, twisted.  And the story has a satisfactory resolution in the end.  You also find out who the characters are and what happens to them.<br /><br />This novel was a huge best seller in Spain.  I found the translation by Lucia Graves (daughter of Robert Graves) to be excellent.<br /><br />Some reviewers are picking nits such as errors in historical minutiae, Spanish grammar, and geography.  (I have spent a lot of time in Europe and have been to Spain, but the \\"errors\\" didn't bother me any.  One reviewer even admits that he is guessing that the must be errors of Barcelona geography.)  It's a novel!  When the complaints go to that low a level, it should indicate to you how good the book is overall.  Other reviewers have unfavorably contrasted the book to G. Marquez's, \\"100 Years of Solitude.\\"  Well, OK, if you have to use a Nobel Prize winner to draw a constrast, that should also indicate the level this book reaches!<br /><br />I would compare this novel to, \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring,\\" \\"The Way the Crow Flies,\\" \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime.\\"  It's very different from all of these; but it shares with them a evocation of mood, strong characters, and the ability to draw you into the book and make you want to keep on reading.  And excellent read.nd the ability to draw you into the book and make you want to keep on reading.  And excellent read.
B00005ONMJ|4.0|This DVD is a slightly abridged version of the opera. It is rather a disappointment for it not to have 'Dalla sua pace.'<br />The set design, costumes and overall production are very good.<br />As for the singers: Don Giovanni is just so perfect.<br />A fine performance from Leporello.<br />Everyone here sings good, but my favorite parts in the opera are sung by Donna Anna, and so it is her that I shall give special mention to. She may have funny looking teeth, but she acts her part so well. Beautiful voice.<br />The scenes of Zerlina-Masseto are so different from the intensity of Anna-Ottavio, but it all fits so well, in scenes such as the end of Act I. There is so much that is funny, yet this does not lessen the impact of the dramatic parts.<br />Furtwangler's conducting seemed slow to me at first, me being accustomed to faster versions. But in scenes like 'Non mi dir,' the brilliance of Furtwangler is very readily apparent.<br />Worth buying for any Mozart fan, if not for its collector appeal then simply for its musical sublimity.
6304100507|5.0|Disney's Oliver and Company fully deserves the five stars.  I first saw the movie on video in the early nineties, and I must have been in a bad mood, because it didn't stick with me.  But I just saw it again, in fact I watched it two times in a row.  My husband watched it the second time with me, and he loved it. I think that this video should be in every child's personal collection.  It has such a wonderful message of believing in yourself during tough times, compassion, friendship, love, and doing the right thing.<br /><br />Set in Manhattan, the backgrounds and art of Oliver and Company are a treat.  I did not appreciate the art of this movie the first time I saw it.  The backgrounds and scenery are brushed with dark browns and blues, evoking the simultaneous urban grit and inexplicable pull of New York City.<br /><br />Based on Charles Dicken's Oliver Twist, Oliver is a homeless kitten who falls in with a gang of stray dogs.  The gang is led by Fagan, voiced by the irreplaceable Dom Deluise.  (What would animated movies be without Dom Deluise?)  Oliver soon meets Jenny, a lonely, loving little rich girl, and he is torn between his two families.  The evil Sykes, to whom Fagan owes money, has plans to hold Jenny for ransom.<br /><br />Billy Joel and Bette Midler provide their speaking and singing voices as Dodge and Georgette.  The original songs in this movie are so special.
B000050X31|4.0|It is so obvious from the very start that the designers of this DVD had no idea what the hell they were doing. Using a 'kids' font for the opening credits? Rather insulting, and sad that this opera of Mozart's wasn't treated as it deserves.<br />James Levine's conducting kind of took me by surprise, right from the start. That's one fast overture, too fast for my taste, overlooking the overture's melodic power. The counterpoint seems to be undermined as well, and the counterpoint is precisely what makes this overture such a peak in all of history. Levine could have been more sensitive. Of course he seems to think that his way is right, but I just wish no future conductors take his cue.<br />'Dies bildnis' comes across as trying-hard, partly because of the stage direction and also because this production's Tamino doesn't blend in with the orchestra all that well.<br />Luciana Serra, who didn't quite nail the Queen of the Night in Colin Davis' CD, gives a much better performance here. Her voice is more powerful and more accurate. The sets used around the Queen of the Night are the coolest in the production as well.<br />A standout in this DVD is Pamina. Her voice is wonderful, but her poor-me look during Sarastro's 'In diesen heil'gen hallen' is kind of ridiculous.<br />I prefer Kurt Moll's rendition of Sarastro in Colin Davis' CD; him being slightly younger then as well may have something to do with that. And if you're questioning why I insist on comparing this DVD to Colin Davis' CD, it's for the simple fact that plenty of the performers in the CD are also featured here.<br />Papageno is supposedly a scene stealer in this DVD. He may be so, but the theatrics of this great work of music are so secondary, I don't care that he elicits laughs from the audience. Made me smile though.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|Ever since rock music started out, most people have enjoyed it, but there have also been some people who don't like it.  Well, whether you love or hate rock music, there is one thing everyone(believe it or not, I have run into a few people who said that they had never heard of Van Halen) should know: Van Halen is a great band, and Eddie Van Halen is a great guitar player.  As another reviewer already mentioned, this was the album that saved rock music(this was because disco music had become so huge)and not only did this album save rock 'n roll, it saved it with good reason.  \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" is one of the greatest songs rock 'n roll ever saw, and since this was Van Halen's first album and that was the opening song for this album, you already know that Eddie Van Halen is a great guitar player, but with \\"Eruption\\"(the second track on this album that is only performed on electric guitar) Van Halen's guitar work really shines.  And thanks to all of the record companies and the bands(KISS was behind their 2001 self-titled boxset and Slaughter was behind the reissues of their first two studio albums, \\"Stick It To Ya\\" and \\"The Wild Life\\") who have been reissuing albums from old bands, Van Halen has also been one of the bands lucky enough to get their debut album released.  The sound on this album has been digitally remastered, and my only complaint is that there are no bonus tracks and no new liner notes which talk about when Van Halen started out and got their first album out on the market........but hopefully someday a boxset that has previously released and previously un-released Van Halen material(studio and live),liner notes which talk about the birth of Van Halen and their whole career, demos of songs that Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and David Lee Roth recorded before they started Van Halen, as well as the four Van Halen demos from 1978 that were produced by Gene Simmons(Simmons is the man we owe a thank you to for discovering Van Halen, and the four demos he produced got Van Halen their recording contract) will see the light of day.  Seven words describe Van Halen.............AWESOME!!!!!!!
B000007T2Z|4.0|There is almost no way to describe the intensity of Godspeed You Black Emperor muchless this album by itself.  While I agree with a few reviewers to make sure that they mention that this band \\"might not be for everyone,\\" I think everyone should give them a try. <br /> <br />Upon my first listen to this album, I thought \\"Wow, this is boring... the music just fades in and out.\\"  So about 2 months ago, I decided to give it another listen.  Either I had progressed in my musical tastes in that short time, or I had finally begun to understand what it was all about. <br /> <br />About 1/8th of this album is spoken word, or samples.  And unfortunately the morons who run this site decided to use THOSE areas of each song.  The last 7/8ths of it is pure talent in song writing and genius in my opinion.  If you have the time to download this over the internet, or would like to take a shot and buy it, DO IT.
B00005JNLY|5.0|Either those giving this a negative review don't have any relatives with severe neurosis, or they don't recognize their own. Well acted by Sandler, Vega and Leoni. It's not a 'gag' movie or a typical 'Sandler' vehicle. Which may turn some off. And Brooks' fondness for insanity might play too big for some, but overall, a nice love story.
B0002XL35G|5.0|Of all the films I've seen in my 40 years, none haunts me more than this one. And really ... what more can we ask of our best art? I only saw it once, but my memory of it is so sublime, so complete, so visceral, that I can almost taste the dust in my mouth.  And I'll be damned if Ry Cooder's isn't among the best -- as in most perfectly suited AND eminently listenable -- soundtracks ever.
B00003CXB4|5.0|OK, maybe Disney copied \\"Kimba, the White Lion\\", but so what?  I still believe that \\"Lion King\\" is much better...\\"Kimba\\" doesn't even come close to this masterpiece! You can't even compare them...seriously. Let's not forget that the original was Japanese and some people HATE anime and cant stand watching those big eyed characters jumping around everywhere! I honestly love Japanese cartoons and I hated Kimba to death, it was just so stupid and boring and the animation was crap ( i know  that it was much older). I never liked Kimba. When i saw it the first time before i even knew about the whole \\"Disney stole our ideas\\" thing i thought it was a very dumb show and when someone told me that Disney was accused of stealing some other company's idea i got a DVD of Kimba and i thought the same thing. I do believe that Disney copied Kimba since there are some scenes in the movie that are exactly the same (character etc) but come on, people our snakes everyone does these things one way or the other... We live on Earth (aka Greedyland) not Candyland! (mmm candy)! I cant say that i agree with Disney's (BAD) deed... i mean the least that they could have done is give those other guys some credit. Meybe the two companies hated each other, maybe they had a \\"pizza hut - domino pizza\\", \\"Britney-Christina\\", \\"McD's -White Castle\\" thing going on, but if they said something like Thanks to: The \\"Whatever it's called company\\" creators of Kimba the white lion: Our inspiration, they would look  like the good guys and not the scoundrels they look like now... Anyway this movie is Great buy it before Disney stops releasing it (31 of this month? What month is it anyway?). The platinum edition is great. \\"Morning Report\\" sucks...BIG time...The DVD is Fun and will keep any fan of the movie busy for a while... The story (you know), the characters (you know), the voice actors (you know)...you know everything don't you? Buy it while you can...or don't buy it and give your $22.49  to people who need it... judgment day is coming people...just kiddin'!
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album is totally awesome!! Except for the fact that it says it has 99 songs and it really only has like, maybe, 20. All the rest are like 3 seconds long. But other than that it ROX!! The way the songs sound are different than most of the other songs on different cd's. But they sound really cool. A must for any Manson fan or someone just, like, exploring for different music.
B00006AVRK|5.0|I really love Granada's \\"Jeeves and Wooster \\" series.  This contains all four seasons.  It's really one of the funniest comedies I've seen.  Jeeves is the perfect mastermind and butler to Wooster almost as smart as Sherlock Holmes.  All the episodes are funny, as Bertie goes into and gets out of one engagement after another and into adventures.  It really is true to P.G. Wodehouse's wonderful books.  It's a great series for the entire family to watch.
0385510454|5.0|The story is well written and suspenseful. It kept me going when I should of been studying for my statistics test. It has everything you look for in a novel; informative, intrigue, interesting characters, conflict, rising tension, and a great climax. Simply put-just a great book. <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|I really loved the movie, \\"The Notebook\\" when I saw it in theatres and love it on dvd too.  It's a really beautiful film.  It's romantic and really heartwarming and well worth seeing.  It's a really well acted and well done story. It's one of those rare gem of a films that can become a classic and really meaningful. I'd give it a ten if I could.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 should just retire. How can I possibly like this album when here we have 11 songs and there's really only one truly good one: 'City Of Blinding Lights'?. This soup is pathetic.  <br /> <br />The only amazing thing about this trash is that Bono can stand or sit up there with his Yamaha synth and his annoying rough strained voice and entertain all with this totally sweet mess boring sedative. The songs are evidence of a rich men whom are over-the-hill, sitting on their cash, spending their empty lives aloof behind dark glasses, cover magazines (As Rolling Stone and Time), fast cars, posh reunions and drinks. <br /> <br />Any REAL U2 fan should not accept this awful mediocrity. Enough said. <br /> <br />There is no hungry passion anymore. Ironic because U2's newer songs certainly have provided passion for some people, like ones such as Celine Dion fans would \\"die\\" for but PLEASE... <br />No deliberate attempt at making music to think about anymore. Their egos are just too damn big! <br /> <br />
0812550706|3.0|While I enjoyed reading the book, at the end I though \\"is that it?\\" It got a bit repetitive, and the ending is guessable about 3/4 the way through.  Based on the reviews, I was looking for more.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie.  It was refreshing to see Tom Cruise play bad guy, and Jamie Foxx is terrific as a cabdriver caught in the middle of his scheme.  Tom Cruise is Vincent, a hit man who essentially forces Jamie Foxx, his cabdriver, to take him from one hit to the next as he attempts to kill 5 people in one night.  Things change when Jamie Foxx's character realizes that Vincent's final victim is a woman (Jada Pinkett-Smith) Foxx had met earlier that day.<br /><br />The movie takes place over less than 10 hours, and as a result has a very high-energy, crazed feeling.  You find yourself viewing the story from the perspective of Jamie Foxx's character, and I certainly wondered quite a few times what I might do if I was in the same situation.  Cruise and Foxx are excellent, and once the story picks up you are completely engrossed through the conclusion.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Who doesn't love this show?  Twenty years later, it still holds up pretty well.  It definitely beats out most of the junk on TV today.  Another television movie would be cool to see.
B00005JMUL|5.0|An enchanting tale for all ages.  Destined to be a Christmas classic. <br />Special fun if you love trains, as our family does.
6300273199|5.0|This is absolutely the best concert film of this band, and it is screaming for a remastering/sound touch-up. I went to alot of concerts in my younger days, and this video makes me nostalgic for that time, when a band just plugged in and ROCKED.  Let's get this on a nice 5.1 surround DVD!  If you like AC/DC, you have to find this. I bought mine at one of the locals thst still had a few video tapes for 5.99!  Glad I grabbed it.
B0002DKCMG|3.0|Rent\purchase this film and leave your brain at the door. You can expect it to be puerile, lowbrow, and at times outlandish.<br /><br />The good-The little German boy drawing a square moustache under his nose, and doing an impression of a famous World War 2 dictator.<br /><br />The bad-The nude beach scene was wrongheaded.  There was just no reason.<br /><br />The Ugly-The twin brother and sister getting loaded on absinthe and voraciously making out.<br /><br />If you like films like Porky's, American Pie, and other outrageous teen-comedies, this one is for you.
B000002JS6|5.0|Normally I would'nt do this, but....  Aerosmith was great in the early days, but are just plain boring now.  As to Guns and Roses, not one person in that \\"band\\" can hold Angus's shorts. Yes kids, AC/DC wipes their collective behinds with both of the aforementioned outfits. Eventually some of these reviewers will come to the same conclusion.  Back In Black is the greatest hard rock album ever produced, and I've heard plenty.  5 stars does'nt even make it. THE fist pumping, head banging rock album.
0894803123|5.0|This book is worth every penny.  It outlines some great ice cream bases, gives you instructions to modify recipes properly for lower fat or sugar alternatives, and has some of the most famous flavors of B&J ice cream.  If you have an ice cream maker, you have to have this book.  If you don't have one, this book will make you want to buy one and experiment!
B0006399FS|1.0|yet another overhyped and overrated album by this corporate machine.     Wasn't enough a collectors edition with no lyric booklet and filler DVD ?    wasn't enough that U2 mp3s were ordered and forced off and mp3s stopped from being distributed on u2 fan sites! No communication or explanation from U2 through u2.com. Many of the songs that were being requested were out of print or songs that would have cost $50 or more for one song or a couple songs! Besides being from fans who have already spent thousands on U2 and that mp3s allows people to \\"test drive\\" them and then encouraged to purchase (what can be purchased) them. Or at least allow individual songs to be downloaded at ITunes for 99 cents. The rest of the songs not available in the U2 ITunes Collection could be encoded in such a way that can't transferred and then hosted on U2 fan sites. I imagine the technology exists and we know for sure that U2 has the wealth. Something else?    wasn't enough that U2 lyrics were ordered and forced to be taken down from U2 fan sites ?    wasn't enough that Sebastian Clayton was \\"laughing\\" at U2 fans complaints and then saying that \\"we're  just passing on (the expenses) to them.\\"    Not informing members if their pre-sale code was only good for the Legs 1&2 or all 3 Legs.  Scalpers having tickets and advertising them on ebay before the presale and immediately after it!  The pre-sale complete fiasco and utter disaster. No GAs available instantly! and the audacity to even offer nosebleeds to longtime loyal fans who paid for u2.com memberships.  U2.com Zootopia crashing  7 hours later u2.com responds. And still no full response.   If many fans are not going to be able to get GAs for all of the concerts that they will be attending and they are definitely not going to purchase the $165 seats then a Tour Conference Announcement could have been made which described some of the details of the Show.     This album is an absolute piece of crap and anyone with any musical sense would throw it out the window for being tainted by this bland, vanilla, and sickening commercial use of the name \\"U2\\". Fortunately, I didn't waste any money on this piece of trash. My aunt gave it to me because she couldn't bare the embarrassment of owning it herself.     Those who thought Pop a low musical effort will take it back when they hear this sad attempt to make up for the fact that the real U2 is no longer with us. Bono has become a total sellout egomaniac. Furthermore, this album is atrociously boring and overhyped as their pitiful 2000 era. Overall this crap is just forgettable drivel taking snippets of other ideas from their previous album and trying to market what people expect to be the \\"U2\\" sound.     Score more points for the recording industry and for the greed of artists thriving on past glories and too indifferent to produce new ones.    Stay away from this lame album and buy some of U2's 90s work instead.    It's time to draw the line !!! NO MORE !!!!!
B00005JKG9|5.0|This movie is a man's movie, full of angry men cursing at each other. Alec Baldwin steals the movie with a speech full of lines like \\"What's my name? $#@* you - that's my name!\\" All of the other performances are great as well, with Pacino getting to do his usual yelling thing, and Jack Lemon transforming into a slimy old saleman. More importantly, Glengarry features Kevin Spacey back in the good ol days when he used to play unlikeable characters in interesting movies, instead of the leading man in cheesy, preachy garbage like Pay it Forward. Wait til the end of the movie for the part where Pacino calls him the C word - it's always enjoyable to watch.
0790739909|5.0|To have loved...nothing can be better. This story teaches us the true meaning of love. A tear jerker for the ladies. The reality of life for so many. A film to be added to any romantic's collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I read the review for Firefly and thought what the heck - it doesn't sound that bad.  An interesting concept to have a western slant to a sci-fi show and it also helped that I had watched Buffy and thought it okay.   <br /> <br />Well was I glad I brought it.  A very funny, well thought out show.  Every one who I have lent the show to have loved it and wanted to know when the next season will start....alas sorry it was CANCELLED.  But I tell them they are making a movie - sorta picking up where the series ended.  YAY  Only problem it's not expected until September 2005.  Too far away.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|Although there is not one hit single featured on this album I recommend it as the best thing Sweet ever recorded.Out to prove themselves as more than a \\"singles band\\" they surpassed themselves both with songs and overall production which was handled by Phil Wainman.The album opens with the swirling, metallic \\"Set Me Free\\" written by guitarist Andy Scott (covered in the 80`s by Saxon on \\"Crusader\\") and I remember as a thirteen year old climbing the walls with excitement. Hellraiser and Ballroom Blitz only hinted that the band were capable of these sounds.\\"Heartbreak Today\\", the second track has a Zeppelinesque riff and Connolly`s vocals have real depth and feeling. Once again the production makes your hi-fi sound ten times better than it probably really is.Next track \\"No You Don`t\\" was sung by Steve Priest, bassist and was covered later by Pat Benatar on her first album. Very angry, aggresive song complete with cellos reminiscent of the Rolling Stones on \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\".\\"Rebel Rouser\\" and \\"Peppermint Twist\\" are probably the poppiest tracks the album has to offer. One of them was a big hit for the band in Australia (can`t remember which however!)\\"Sweet F.A.\\" is the epic of the album at over 6 minutes long. It ROCKS! Heavier than any of the supposedly heavy bands of the time! Scary for little Mary I`d say!\\"Restless\\", again sung by Steve - a great stage favourite - a bitlike Free`s \\"Alright Now\\".\\"Into The Night\\", the next track was written and sung by Andy Scott and is reminiscent of something from Deep Purple`s \\"In Rock\\" album.The album offficially closes with \\"AC/DC\\" (rumoured to be where a certain Australian band took their name.) A song about bi-sexuality!!! This CD version of the album has some bonus track which were initially hard to get hold of B sides that indicated this monster of an album might be in the hearts of this greatly underrated band.If you love Seventies rock music, if you love great playing, if you love a well produced album, if you ever wondered what Sweet were really all about - THIS IS THE ALBUM!
B0000035E7|4.0|In 1989 a little known Seattle, Washington trio were playing a heavy guitar, speedy drumming, and moving bass line of songs that would later be known as the \\"Grunge\\" movement. After touring relentlessly for a year or so, the trio went into Reciprocal Rcordings with producer Jack Endino to make the prelude to their 1991 breakthrough simply called \\"Nevermind\\". The band was Nirvana and their breakthrough was called Bleach. The begging of the record starts with a moving bass line only commitable by Krist Noveselic on \\"Blew\\" and leads into very low tuned guitars and fierce tribal drumming from Pre-Nevermind drummer Chad Channing. Kurts vocals in this song are deep pitched and tragic as he claims \\"Is there another reason for your stain/Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?/<br /><br />Here is another word that rhymes with shame.\\" Next is the heavy yet fast recording of \\"Floyd the Barber\\" while the lyrics to this song are as scary as the boogeyman himself, the chorus is simply irristable and catchy. Next comes the Beatles' influenced melodic masterpiece \\"About A Girl\\" while the guitars and drums are somewhat simplistic the melody is extremely catchy and you'll be singing it all day. Next on the list is the very well played \\"School\\", while the lyrics are Sub-par the guitar and drumming is excellent as well as the fantastic bass line and incredibaly catchy \\"No Recess\\" line. \\"Love Buzz\\" follows and its irrisistable bass line draws you in like a trap into the Shocking Blue cover of catchy bass and solid lyrics. Next comes probably the heaviest song of the cd, the offbeat but hard rocking \\"Paper Cuts\\". While the guitars are out of tune and the drums are as pounding as a headache it still leaves you wanting more due to its hypnotizing chorus. Next comes one of my favorites of Nirvana's called \\"Negative Creep\\" with hard, bruising guitars and schreechy, sore singing by Kurt this makes Pantera sound like faries(Even though Pantera is awesome). \\"Scoff\\" comes after and has one of my favorite drum beats of all time on it. While the song itself is rather weak the track shows the vocal strength of Kurt Cobain. \\"Swap Meet\\" the third best on the album, brings to mind later Nirvana songs like Very Ape and Lounge Act. \\"Mr. Moustace\\" trancends with some solid guitars and some sore vocals from kurt but overall the song is worth skipping so you can get to the next song \\"Sifting\\" my personal favorite Soundgarden-like Nirvana song. \\"Sifting is an interesting song in that its deeply lidden guitars, bass, and vocals are still so catchy its crazy(it took me 2 days to get this song out of my head). \\"Big Cheese\\"  comes afterwards and is pretty good with only one minor problem, Kurts vocals are so melodic and smooth at times that you begin to wonder if this is what Nirvana wanted to sound like, while incrediably catchy..it doesnt display Nirvana's early sound that well. \\"Downer\\" a ritilan induced speed punk song is the final track and is a solid way to end the album with some pretty good drumming and lyrics this is definatley a keeper. While this is no Nevermind or In Utero its still worth spending your money on...just be warned, this record may change your life.ne of my favorite drum beats of all time on it.

B00000F169|5.0|John Carpenter's claim to fame rests largely on his contributions to the horror film genre. He's responsible for the hugely influential 1970s slasher flick \\"Halloween,\\" of course, but he's also made several other noteworthy horror movies. His remake of \\"The Thing\\" still impresses over twenty years later thanks to a great cast, incredible special effects, and scads of claustrophobic atmosphere. \\"The Fog,\\" starring Adrienne Barbeau, is Carpenter's attempt at a good old-fashioned ghost story. I could go on and on, mentioning the killer car film \\"Christine,\\" the satanic \\"The Prince of Darkness,\\" and the Lovecraftian horror of \\"In the Mouth of Madness.\\" Fortunately, Carpenter occasionally made films in other genres, such as the science fiction classics \\"Escape From New York,\\" \\"Starman,\\" and the hilarious \\"They Live\\" starring none other than one time pro wrestler Roddy Piper. In his prime Carpenter had the Midas touch, and it all started with a little film called \\"Dark Star\\" way back in the early 1970s. Donald Pleasance doesn't appear to make a speech about Michael Myers, there is no canister containing an evil fluid in the basement of a church, and no Kurt Russell shooting up the bad guys in this movie. \\"Dark Star\\" is a comedy set in deep space.<br /><br />Pinback (Dan O'Bannon), Talby (Dre Pahich), Doolittle (Brian Nerelle), and Boiler (Cal Kuniholm) are four poor saps on a rather boring mission. Their assignment takes them into the outer reaches of the universe in search of unstable planets, which they then blow up with talking bombs in order to clear pathways for human colonization. You heard correctly: not only do the bombs talk but they also possess personalities and voices capable of conveying happiness, sarcasm, and can partake in complex philosophical discussions. We come into the story shortly after the demise of Captain Powell, and the crew is looking slightly demoralized. One can only blow up so many cold balls of rock before boredom sets in. One of the crewmembers does nothing but peer at the stars through a glass bubble on top of the spacecraft. Another plays a strange looking instrument made of jars and other acoustically viable pieces of hardware. All of the crewmembers bicker incessantly over the most mundane issues. In \\"Dark Star,\\" the tagline won't read, \\"In space no one can hear you scream\\" like it does in \\"Alien,\\" but rather \\"In space no one can hear you yawn.\\" If you think this little joke is funny, it's even funnier because Dan O'Bannon is the guy who wrote the screenplay for \\"Alien.\\"<br /><br />A significant portion of the film deals with an odd situation between Pinback and his pet alien, which resembles in no small way a huge beach ball that shakes and chitters. This ball has a bad attitude, however, and soon escapes from its chamber when its master arrives to feed it. Pinback chases the creature through the ship, dodging the beastie's attacks while getting angrier and angrier. This alien means to stay loose, however, and nearly kills Pinback by knocking him down an elevator shaft. Meanwhile, the entire ship faces imminent danger in the form of an activated bomb that fails to deploy due to a malfunctioning piece of machinery. The bomb sits firmly in a locked position on the ship, refusing all attempts by the crew to convince it to carry out its prearranged task. Things look so deadly serious that the crew consults the cryogenically frozen body of Captain Powell, which can talk and answer questions, to come up with a few options. Carpenter manages to turn what would normally be a grim ending into something clever and rather amusing. Then again, most of the film is quite amusing in numerous ways.<br /><br />The funniest character is Pinback, and he's also the one with the most screen time. Although I thought the sequence with him and the beach ball alien ran on longer than necessary, the scenes were amusing. Watching him try to climb up the elevator shaft, as well as an extremely close call that almost costshim his head, is to witness an amazing feat of physical comedy. Just as worthy of a few chuckles is watching him go back through his video diary. We soon learn that these guys have been on their mission for so long that this poor fellow's name isn't even Pinback; it was something else once but for some reason now lost in the mists of time he assumed his current moniker. Fans of horror and science fiction movies recognize O'Bannon's name thanks to \\"Alien\\" and a few other films, but his performance in \\"Dark Star\\" shows that he possesses some fine acting chops. I also commend John Carpenter; he made his budget go a long ways in this film. While some of the set pieces look quite cheesy, most of what we see appears very convincing considering the era in which he made the movie. It's difficult to critique this movie without taking into consideration how successful Carpenter became later, but the movie looks great and just exudes a feeling that here is a guy who would go places. Well, he did.<br /><br />The disc contains two versions of the film, an uncut one as well as a special edition print. A trailer for the movie, cast and crew biographies, and production notes round out the supplements. Carpenter went on to make a few other extremely low budget films, most notably \\"Assault on Precinct 13\\" and \\"Halloween,\\" before studio executives woke up and realized he was a talent they could throw money at by the bucketful. Ultimately, I think Carpenter did his best work with lower budgets. Fans of the man will definitely want to check this disc out posthaste, and those interested in seeing what the creator of \\"Halloween\\" did before that film came out should see this as well. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours.costs him his head, is to witness an amazing feat of physical comedy. Just as worthy of a few chuckles is watching him go back through his video diary.

B00004XMS0|5.0|Here we have Batman in his brand new human life Adventures. We see him grow with his \\"issues\\" as an orphan and try to find love in many different places but as always his double personality gets in the way. We'll see Bruce Wayne/Batman defeat all his archi-enemies: The Joker, The Penguin, Catwoman, Two Face, The Riddler, Mr. Freeze & Poison Ivy. And here it tells how he meets his longtime partner and... \\"lover\\" for some people... Robin. But anyways I highly recommend this DVD Pack for every Batman Fan, Buy it & stay tunned for Batman begins, the new movie.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera was a hell of a lot better than those idiots like Van Halen and Led Zeppelin and AC/DC. (Not Metallica!) The best tracks on this CD are \\"Primal Concrete Sludge\\", a quick-paced song, \\"Domination\\", a live favorite, \\"Cowboys From Hell\\", the first song off this album that got me hooked to it, \\"Psycho Holiday\\", a song with Dimebag wailing at that guitar like none other, and, of course, \\"Cemetary Gates\\". That song is very emotional and may make you cry, even more since the horrible tragedy in Columbus, Ohio.  You will be missed, Dimebag.<br /><br />I was watching \\"Uranium\\" on Fuse, it was that episode where they go to Dimebag's house. Christ, that guy was rich! He had a hell of a lot of posters on his wall, and his house was so damn big that it makes you want to take up guitar and become the next Dimebag. Now I wonder what happened to his house ever since he got killed? Makes you sad.<br /><br />I'm going to cry now...R.I.P. Dimebag, you will be a martyr to every current heavy metal icon.  'sniff'

B000002UYZ|3.0|This is a ripoff.  I've copied both my CD and LP versions onto one CD.  There is no reason this should cost 30 some bucks. <br /> <br />The remastering of \\"I Feel Fine\\" is cleaned up and, sadly, has lost its original character.  If you have the original LP, keep it.
B0002ZMITY|4.0|A wonderful film! This could so easily have been a half hour television programme over-extended to fill a film's running time, but by teaming up with the ever professional writers directors and producers at Working Title, Sacha Baron Cohen has produced a film that really feels like a film. The plot works well, and although there is a small problem over whether Ali G is really cool, or really a bit of a wally (the writing is inconsistent here), he is never an unsympathetic character, even when being selfish or misogynistic. Some of the humour is crude, ppeurile, or even embarrassing, but this is in keeping with the whole Ali G thing, and if you're a fan I doubt you would be offended. The scenes set in the gang land of L.A. are excellent, and wouldn't look out of place in a Steven Segal movie, and believe it or not, these fit in well with the urban decline of Staines and its environs.<br /><br />There is some good support playing by Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, who look a little out of place, but are nevertheless convincing. It was a good idea for Gambon's Prime Minister to be a good guy, so different from the cynicism we normally expect from political comedy. There is a dreadful guest performance from fashion model Naomi Campbell, who looks great but can't act, so it's no surprise that the majority of this ends up in the 'deleted scenes' extra.<br /><br />The soundtrack is superb, clearly having been put together by someone with a good knowledge of Rap and Hip Hop classics of the last twenty years, and this complements the action enormously by lending it some much needed credibility. The extras are good, especially as Ali himself presents the excised scenes with the introduction that they were cut because they were no good! This film is much better than I thought it would be, and my recommendation is that if you like Ali G you will love this film.
1932100385|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read on nutrition and health. It gives the reader the \\"big picture\\". Conclusions from a single study can be questioned, but when the \\"weight of evidence\\" from hundreds of studies from all over the world point the same direction, it's impressive. <br /> <br />The studies on animal protein and cancer fascinated me. Also, how industry influences government is clearly laid out from an insider's perspective. <br /> <br />In my view, this book is right up there with \\"Eat to Live\\" by Joel Fuhrman. If you want to experience good health and well being, read these books!
B00000ILDF|2.0|\\"Aliens\\" was a triumphant sequel, taking on all the odds that suggested that sequels \\"stink.\\"  That is why when \\"Alien 3\\" was made, we had to know the end of a good run was coming.  While \\"Alien 3\\" looks good and maybe has a little bit of the feel of the original, it drowns in a terrible storyline and a worse script.  First of all, Hicks and Newt (Who Ripley spent the last half hour in \\"Aliens\\" saving are killed off right off the bat, wow, what a downer.  Ripley is depressed and so was the guy who continued to write the script about a bunch of lifers who say things that make no sense, for example, when the prisoners and Ripley begin building a trap for the Alien, one prisoner asks Ripley \\"Why should we help you?\\"  Um...maybe because there is an Alien running around and it will eat you if you don't kill it?  We are also put through a boring love affair, a cheesy speech by Charles Dutton and a stupid and overly designed scene where everyone is running around dark tunnels trying to trap the Alien.  There's no comic relief like in \\"Aliens\\" and no real scares like in \\"Alien.\\"  This is just plain stupid, and worse, the sequel that came next.  Don't waste your time with this slop, go see the first two films again, it'll be more entertaining.
B00000IAU3|3.0|A cross between Sarah McLachlan and Suzanne Vega. Musically a tad bit of Portishead. (don't ask) I bought both \\"No Angel\\" and \\"Life For Rent\\" and they're pretty good albums. \\"White Flag\\" is a great, catchy song. I really thought it was Sarah McLachlan for the first few times I heard it though. It's good listening music. Dido has tremendous talent and defiantly room to grow. If your into the acts I mentioned in this post, then give Dido a try. Good stuff. Look forward to more.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I say surprisingly good as I don't normally don't listen to this genre of music.  I'm a fan of Selah, who wrote \\"You Lift Me up\\" (and later recorded it for themselves).  I was curious what Josh Groban's version sounded like since I had only heard Selah's version.  I was sufficiently impressed to listen to music samples of some of his other songs and later bought the album.  This cd is great to listen to when the mood is calm and relaxed.  In other reviews it was mentioned that it was good to put on to impress a girl.  While that's true, I think it would truly be a waste to only listen to this cd when a guy is trying to impress a girl.  This is good music to listen to when you're reading, sitting by a fire, having a quiet conversaion with a friend or loved one, having dinner etc...He has a great voice and the songs themselves are a nice mix of upbeat and slow.  Give it a try, I highly doubt you'll regret it.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Is Jack Nicholson good in this? Yes! Is he playing himself? You bet! Apart from the fact that  67 year-old Jack is a little healthier than the heart-attack prone 63 year old lead character in this movie, it could almost be written for him. Perhaps it's not so surprising that the more consistent Diane Keaton gives a good performance, although it's strange to see her playing an older character. That said, the person she plays is an intelligent, vivacious playwright who has (like Keaton herself, but more like writer and director Nancy Myers) aged gracefully into her fifties. The storyline attempts to address the Hollywood clich&eacute; of the older leading man with the younger starlet, something that is seen as much in the private lives of film stars as it is in the movies they appear in. Like many people, I am a little tired of the Conneries, Nicholsons, and even now the Bill Murrays ending up with girlfriends twenty or even thirty years their junior. It stretches credibility and is more than a little sexist. This film addresses this question with a woman who is not only prepared to challenge the status quo, but who almost in spite of herself ends up reversing it. With her younger lover played by a relaxed Keanu Reeves (no doubt relieved to be free of the technical demands of filming the Matrix series), Keaton is believable and sympathetic, even to the extent that we almost want her to end up with Reeves rather than Nicholson.<br /><br />The dialogue is clever, seeming at times like a play, rather than a movie, and this gives the film an economic look which makes you concentrate on the characters. I should say a few words in favour of Amanda Peet, who plays Keaton's daughter. It's a good performance, and she's beautiful, but ultimately, she is just there for plot purposes and you are left feeling that she is a cipher rather than a person.<br /><br />The DVD extras are OK, benefiting from two commentaries, both with Meyers, one also featuring Jack and the other Diane. The studio has put a little more imagination into the extras though, and it is particularly nice to see and hear Jack Nicholson sing. Overall, it's a thought provoking film, but ultimately entertaining, interesting, and quite funny. Highly recommended.studio has put a little more imagination into the extras though, and it is particularly nice to see and hear Jack Nicholson sing.

038572179X|5.0|I chose to read all of Ian McEwan's other novels before starting on \\"Atonement\\", as I had seen from his other work that this was a very special writer. I wanted to enjoy the progression of his writing from his earliest works in the 1970's up to this highly recognized and intelligent novel. I am glad I waited, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of experiencing this book through the perspective of his other works. This takes on a weighty and important tone from the very beginning, and in it, McEwan is able to delve as deeply into the minds and motivations of his characters as he has in any of his other works. McEwan speaks in the reassuring voice and confident prose that is his hallmark, and I found this to be an emotionally moving and painful, yet important book. <br /> <br />There is true literary magic at work here. A writer looks back on a pivotal event in her early life, which she propagated, and which caused a gaping and irreparable wound within her family. The title is ambiguous, much like his \\"Enduring Love\\" was about nothing of the sort, and \\"The Comfort of Strangers\\" was really about the dangers of outsiders (stranger-danger?). McEwan writes here about epic themes - family estrangement, war, dislocation, emotional baggage and how that impacts one's life, unforgiveness and imagination. Whether the vital facts of the story within a story were true or the subject of Briony's (the girl at the center of the story) great imagination, much of this story is about her efforts to forgive herself and come to terms with (\\"atone for\\") her mistake and in doing so, find peace within herself. Taking place over more than sixty years, I felt like I had lived with the characters through their traumas. <br /> <br />Once again, McEwan creates unforgettable characters; once again he takes on grand themes and succeeds superbly; and again, he has created a story that must be read.
0785814531|5.0|What a bargain I happened upon when I bought this book in the bargain section of a local book store!  I, like many others, had read the \\"Tell-Tale Heart\\", the \\"Pit and the Pendulum\\", \\"The Raven\\" etc.. along with other famous Poe stories and poems, but upon reading even more, I realized that Poe is indeed one of the great storytellers to have ever lived.  Each story is unique and fantasically written.  I urge any fan of Poe's to buy this book as soon as possible and enjoy all of his work, poems, stories and even literary criticisms!
B00014X8KO|5.0|\\"Memories\\" is a 3-part science fiction/anime collection marketed as one film.<br /><br />The first episode, Magnetic Rose\\", is an emotional but stirring SF story of love and regret; the second, \\"Stink Bomb\\", is a humorous look at environmental disaster; the third, \\"Cannon Fodder\\", examines warfare and the dehumanization that goes with it.<br /><br />Each film has a definite stylistic individuality.  \\"Magnetic Rose\\" reminds me of parts of The Animatrix; \\"Stink Bomb\\" looks like it could have come from the artists who created the original, classic Heavy Metal movie; and, best (and undoubtedly strangest) of all, \\"Cannon Fodder\\" bears more than passing resemblance to the surreal animation of Pink Floyd's The Wall.<br /><br />Don't let the jarring differences put you off from seeing this film.  Each has its own merits, with few drawbacks.<br /><br />The one disadvantage I encountered when viewing this DVD was the lack of an English soundtrack;  I don't speak Japanese, and the subs whiz by so fast (keeping up with the speech rate of the characters) that if I want to read them, I must frequently pause the film to read it.<br /><br />Other than that teeny nit, this is a definite PLUS in my collection.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I picked up a copy of this movie basically because I had a gift certificate to cash in and I had seen it advertised when it was playing at my city's trendier venues. There was definitely a deliberate quirkiness to the characters that seemed a bit formulaic in the indie/cult genre and was rather annoying at first. Creating characters so cartoonishly geek ridden and over the top for its own sake is simply not enough to carry a movie. I just hope the next generation of such films doesn't resort merely to funky hair, tacky clothes, and a spazoid demeanor and merely ride those JC Penny coattails. That being said, I have to admit Aaron Ruell's Kip character really grew on me like a matted down fungus. I can't get his lame poetry, weak nasal speech, and bad posture out of my head. I actually worked with someone who was eerily similar and planned to buy a missile silo so, in that sense, his character was believable. Also, kudos to Tina Majorino for taking a break from the pratfalls of the child actress to come back with a valiant effort as a relatively invisible high school student.  <br /> <br />As for the plot, hmmmm. What actually happened? Napolean gets Pedro elected class president, wins the cute wallflower, and his brother Kip, transformed into a hip hop philosopher, leaves town with his internet babe LaFawnduh. Even Uncle Rico is joined by some oddly intrigued cameo babe while videotaping himself throwing the pigskin in a field. There were no real unconventional surprises or groundbreaking plot twists, but in all this movie was amusing enough on the merits of its quirkiness.

They are now sending copies to thier sisters and friends. Every woman I have shown this book to has loved it, men on the other hand, have hated it. But then again they would because it finally tells the truth.  <br />This is honestly the best singles guide out there for women. They don't tell you how to \\"fix\\" yourslef, the writers just let you know you are perfect and some man out there is waiting to meet you the way you are....perfect!
068485743X|4.0|I was very pleased with this book. It takes a no-nonsense approach to the writing concepts and skills most likely to prevent an editor from reading a manuscript. Topics are presented in order of importance (as determined by the author) and I think he's pretty much on target. The only complaint I have is that his examples of  bad writing are so obviously bad that they're really not realistic examples at all. But if a writer objectively reviews his/her manuscript after reading and absorbing this book, he/she should be able to find all the problems Mr. Lukeman covers. Fixing them, however, is another story.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I can't give this 5 stars cuz I reserve that only for absolute 100% masterpieces.  This album, however, is growing on me big time.  I didn't want to buy it but someone gave it to me so I listened, apprehensively.  It just gets better and better every time I listen to it. <br /> <br />Some old skool Green Day punk fans will say they sold out a long time ago.  Green Day never claimed they were 'punk'.  They just make music that originally appealed to punk fans, then all of a sudden they got famous and were labeled 'mainstream'.  I'm not into punk or mainstream.  If it sounds good, I'll take it. <br /> <br />All these people who gave this album 1 star probably never really gave it a chance.  Some albums take several listens before you can get an accurate opinion of it.  Some albums sound awesome the first time but wear out fast, and sometimes it's the other way around. <br /> <br />Or something...
B00029LNHS|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of the hip-hop/rap genre, but once in awhile I come across an artist who has something that appeals to me.  My original foray into this genre was way back in junior high with artists such as DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Arrested Development, and MC Hammer.  I also listened a little bit to artists such as NWA, but not as much.<br /><br />Since that time, little has peaked my interest in that genre until now.  The Black Eyed Peas have the ability to be both fun and intelligent at the same time.  That seems to be lacking these days in the hip-hop arena.  I remember listening to Arrested Development and thinking that they wouldn't last very long because their music was too honest.  It opened up too many old wounds that had been ignored up to that point.<br /><br />The Black Eyed Peas haven't really cracked old scars with \\"Elephunk,\\" but they do manage to get you thinking.  I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Where Is The Love.\\"  It's a good song with a good message.  \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" is my least favorite song on this album.  It's radio-ready brother, \\"Let's Get It Started,\\" sounds so much better lyric-wise.  \\"Hey Mama\\" is pretty good, though I enjoyed the radio version better with Fergie's nice voice.  \\"Shut Up\\" has a sound to it that is very appealing to the ears.  It has a good beat and is fun to listen to.  Other songs that are standouts included \\"Smells Like Funk\\" and \\"Hands Up.\\"  There's also a hidden track at the end of the disc which is also very good.<br /><br />In summary, this may not be the best Black Eyed Peas disc out there.  Judging from other reviews, it is their weakest.  However, it seems to have a wider appeal than their other albums and end the end may open new listeners up to their earlier stuff.  That means that \\"Elephunk\\" will have served its purpose, which is to make a little more cash for the Peas and spread their message a little farther along.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0440237688|5.0|What can be said about this book that has not been said many times before.  I just feel compelled to attempt and add something to the other comments made about this book.   <br /> <br />The novel centers around the idea of choices and consequences.  If we choose one thing we may loose the opportunity for something else.  A choice made today has unimaginable consequences days and maybe years later.  The fate of the whole \\"world\\" lies with Jonah and how he chooses to use his powers and gifts, and Jonah feels completely unprepared for this.  He's forced into dealing before he is ready.  This book is an excellant read for adolescents.  They are faced with choices each day and are so often incapable of seeing the consequences.   <br /> <br />The ending is ambiguous.  We are left wondering what really did happen.  This book is the first in a loosely connected series, and the answers will not come to you until you have read Gathering Blue and The Messenger, both of which are equally excellant books.   <br /> <br />I must say my peace about these books again though.  A fourth grader may be able to read these books based on the vocabulary and basic story line, but a fourth grader will not be able to appreciate these books for what they are truly worth.  The theme of creating a utopia and the disposal of the elderly are ideas that I don't think are appropriate for younger students.  Please reserve using these books for middle school or high school students.
B00001OH7O|5.0|What's YOUR favourite album?  'Born in the USA'?  'The Joshua Tree'? Is an Eminem or an Ice-T more to your taste?  How about 'What's Going On', or 'Family Affair'?  Some great works don't just stand the test of time - they sidle out of their genre and into the consciousness even of those who profess to hate 'urban' or 'rock' or 'stadium'.  'Hunky Dory' is one such album. <br /> <br />Sure, it has the pop songs everybody loves to hear - 'Changes', 'Oh! You Pretty Things', 'Andy Warhol' - but delve a little further and might just see something considerably more challenging underneath.  Listen a couple of times to 'Queen Bitch' (preferably alone, in the dark, and very loud).  Look under the surface: can you just see something a little dark, a little desperate moving there?  How about 'Bewlay Brothers'?  Does it make your hair curl?  How about if I tell you that Bowie's half-brother was a schizophrenic who spent most of his adult life in institutions before throwing himself in front of a train aged 36?  How about if I tell you that he was Bowie's most important formative influence as a teenager?  How about Bowie's own deep fear of his own incipient mental illness? <br /> <br />This is NOT a great pop album (though it's all of that): it's a great album, full stop (or 'period' if you prefer).  It's rich, funny, full of great tunes, and intensely personal in places.  Just the kind of thing an over-the-hill adolescent needs to get him through the day. <br /> <br />Oh, and am I wrong, or is 'Life on Mars' the finest track ever?written?
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Thursday, February 10, 2005 / 3 of 5 / Forced clich&eacute;<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this film going in, having heard it was an indie favorite.  Yes, it was quirky but was it likable?  Not really.  Oddball outcast Napoleon Dynamite struggles in a world he never made, while is simpering brother and nostalgia ridden hairpiece of an uncle provide backup fodder.  Character development was minute to non-existant.  Granted, Napoleon and brother `came out' of their shells, but we are left wondering about the rest of this odd Idaho world.  Uncle Rico while at times amusing should have stayed in the basement of Real Genius.  The lead is simply not very compelling and a bit too force clich&eacute;d for those of us who did our high school time in the 80's.  I could see where this could earn cult status, but it simply didn't hit me the right way like the definitive snarky HS epic, Heathers.

B000089RVR|5.0|Beautiful, wonderful, a must have. This album grew on me with each listen... songs I thought I didn't care for turned out to be my favorite (\\"Life for Rent\\") and others grip you from the first listen (\\"Sand in My Shoes\\") and don't let go.
0316666343|3.0|This book was the pick for a monthly book club I recently joined.  I had some reservations about it during the choosing process because I have a reflexive aversion to media products that reach the over-saturation point (I plan on never seeing \\"Forrest Gump\\" or \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" for that same reason).  I heard and read so many rave reviews of this book, nearly all of which included some version of the warning about the first chapter's harrowing description of Susie's rape and murder.  I actually read this chapter online somewhere before buying the book because if it *was* too harrowing for me, I wouldn't have even wanted to buy the book and read the rest. <br /> <br />I was a little surprised because that first chapter was neither as graphic nor lyrical as I expected from the reviews.  Not that I wanted it to be more of either -- rather, looking back, I wonder, what was the purpose of including it in the extended form in which it appears?  I did not find that it revealed an awful lot about the characters.  Maybe I just didn't dwell on it long enough -- was I supposed to?  That would have made me feel like I was violating Susie myself.  I know that the author herself was raped (not when she was as young as Susie, though), and I suspect that this chapter was very therapeutic for her to write.  And that's OK, but there is something about it that makes it feel like it doesn't fit.  Why should I, the reader, know so much more about what happened to her than her own family, the people who loved her most?  Couldn't Susie have become the omniscient narrator that Sebold requires to tell this story if she were hit by a car or died in some other violent way?   <br /> <br />I really like the general theme that there *are* worthy stories to be told about the American suburbs.  I think this story is not really about just Susie.  The protagonist is her family, or perhaps The Family.  The awful thing that happened to her is the really just the catalyst for the story of therest of the members of her family (and Ruth and Ray), which is where the \\"brilliant,\\" \\"sparkling,\\" \\"sensitive\\" writing takes place. <br /> <br />All of which takes me back to my perplexity over that opening chapter, and also my lingering discomfort with the scene where Susie and Ruth switch places for a while so that Susie and Ray can finish what they almost started that day before Susie was killed.  But, see, this too feels too \\"device-y\\" and constructed for my taste.  The writing and plotting break down for me here, too.  It doesn't feel authentic enough to be redemptive for Susie, even though it's a large part of what apparently allows her to move on in her afterlife.  Her deeper understanding of her mother (and to some extent her father) is ultimately what gives her the ability to grow (and so true for the rest of us), so this encounter with Ray again feels to me like it doesn't quite fit. <br /> <br />
B0000024IE|5.0|A pure friggin classic of unabashed power, positivity, in your face beats.  While It Takes A Nation was heralded as the ultimate classic, this album I feel went higher up the echelon, and has a total go for broke and go for your throat mentality. <br /> <br />It's sad to hear rap now, the majority of it is pathetic.  Chuck D had to be the best MC I have ever heard in my life.
1400032717|5.0|Much has been said about his book, it's plot and premise.<br /><br />The thing most reviews seem to miss is how importnat this book is in demonstrating the emotional world of Aspergers Syndrome. Too often this condition, and I use that term for want of a better one, is dimissed as one in which the individual lacks normal emotional responses. I feel this work demonstrates the inaccuracy of that stance, Christopher, the central character does not lack emotion at all, moreover he expresses it differently. His responses to his sense of emotion are primal and honest. It does not seem that he is wrong so much as incapable of developing cynicism, \\"normalisation\\" and manipulation. He has honest, earlier sensibilities.<br /><br /> And all this coexists with a blindingly hot intellect.<br /><br />It seems almost to be a blissfull mode of being and the question is raised, if it is not the rest of us who so smugly assume we are developed correctly, who may have the \\"special needs\\". Christopher has much more a sense of honesty about his own internal world and his relationship with it afterall.<br /><br /> This is great book with simple and powerful insights, even if you know nothing of Aspergers, you will after this and you will probably wonder, as did I, what is so wrong with this anyway?<br /><br /> Christopher is an infuriating delight and hear lies the premise I believe the Author wants us to most explore, \\"is Christopher so different and if so why and if there are whys, are they wrong?\\".<br /><br /> I have a dear friend who wrote a book on this subject, in respect of her x-boyfriend; \\"Loving Mr Spock\\" by \\"Babara Jacobs\\" In her book she prefers to call people like Christopher, emotionally \\"different wired\\" and I really see that after reading this book. It is not a matter of a difference that needs correction so much as difference that needs socially assimilating and needs learning from.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This is a movie that will definitly keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire length. I love the characters. They are so well played. It's amazing how this story springs up. The fight scenes are so awesome, especially the one in the blue-lit danceclub. It's fast-paced and sexy. I highly recommend it to everyone looking for some fun!
B000002UWP|5.0|Normally, I don't particularly like pop music, but this album is a masterpiece. I first bought this album in high school after a girlfriend showed it to me, and like so many others, simple wore the tape out. I can't think of another album where EVERY song is great... and this is coming from a guy that was into metal at the time. <br /> <br />I've probably listened to Fading Like a Flower several hundred times since 1991, and I'm still not tired of it. The melodies stick with you and you can't help humming them to yourself later on. <br />I only wish Roxette would have continued their style of Joyride... but no such luck. The other albums are alright, but nothing compared to this. <br /> <br />If you're taking a roadtrip, or just need some beautifully written music to listen to, by this CD before it's out of production- you won't be sorry.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Garage, Inc. came out a while ago, and I bought it right away.  For the first few years, it mostly occupied its familiar place on my cd rack and collected dust.  Although I recognized that it was far better (thank ...) then Load and Re-load (of rip-us-off ...), \\"it still wasnt Metallica,\\" and that just wasnt good enough for me and my head-banging ways.  That was while I was in High School, pre-maturity, pre-refined taste, pre-classic rock discovery, and above all, pre-St. (F'n) Anger.  This album deserves 5 stars if only by comparison to that masterpiece, but the truth is, Garage Inc. is a great (mature)rock album, and I regret the fact that I disregarded it for so long.  Over the last couple of years, this has become my most-listened to Metallica album (yes, I own and love Puppets, Lightning, etc.).  The first cd is really great, and makes for a perfect on-the-road soundtrack.  \\"Free Speach,\\" the opening track, is a throw-away, but the rest of the covers are immensely enjoyable, especially if you're familiar with the originals.  Metallica adds that old musical wizardry that has since disappeared to make the songs there own, while having little in common with the great Metallica works of old.  The second cd is a bit more of a headbanger (think Kill Em All, just not as \\"natural\\"), and is fun and enjoyable in its own right.  The bottom line: despite being a cover album, this is the only really good \\"mature\\" Metallica album. In comparison to there other quality work, this one stands out the most, because it is successfully different.  In the last decade, Metallica has made numerous disastrous attempts (at least as far as their fan base is concerned)at sounding \\"different\\" from their 80's hay-day.  This is the only post-Black Album effort that doesnt belong in the recycle bin.  Its an eclectric collection of great music by a once-peerless band facing a long, sad decline - probably the last such effort its fans will ever get...
B00009V7P8|5.0|This work is truly original and quite stunning.<br /><br />I am utterly in ore of Rice's musical and life philosophy.<br /><br />The songs are delicate, evocative and stirring. They expresses the whole package of emotions  that make up the experience at the heart of each song. You can sense the beauty, the fragility and moreover the seductive isolation of love struck pain.  There must barely be an dult who does not know how that feels but it so rare to find an artform that succintly captures it - this album is one such form. There is real sense of honesty and boiling to the bone with this work, even the cover is recycled card with none of the usual hard plastic wallet, and the art work is frank and bold.<br /><br /> This is not to say it is the kind of music to drive you to Prozac, there is a positive, sensibility throughout making the work captivating and self affirming.<br /><br /> It has all the hallmarks of a classic album to inform us of finer feeling.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am a big fan of musicals, having been exposed to masterpieces such as The Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables when I was no more than five.  But since those two, I had not listenned a soundtrack that truly gripped my heart. I had seen Wicked displayed in the Broadway section of Borders, but never really gave it any consideration.  Then a best of broadway cd was displayed and I decided to give that one a listen.  \\"Defying Gravity\\" was the very last song on this best of broadway cd, and it astounded me.  I decided I had to lend an ear to this new musical called \\"Wicked\\". <br /> <br />From my very first listen, I was hooked.  The culmination of the openning number, \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\", and last song of the first act, \\"Defying Gravity\\" (in which Idina Menzel, who portrays Elphaba: The Wicked Witch of the West, soars to a vocal climax high above the citizens of Oz) continue to shoot chills down my spine.  <br /> <br />Any track with Idina Menzel is instantly a hit in my mind, as she is pure talent. \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"Not that Girl\\", and especially \\"No Good Deed\\", are all brilliant displays of her vocal genius.  <br /> <br />Kristin Chenoweth, who plays Glinda the Good, is also mystifying in her abilities.  Her high-pitched comedic voice (paired with fantastic timing) make her unforgettable. In such songs as \\"Thank Goodness\\" and the aforementioned \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\", Kristen's voice reaches an altitue which many singers could never dream of attaining.  <br /> <br />Norbert Leo Butz, who plays Fiyero (the Winkie prince and love interest of both Glinda and Elphaba), is also very talented.  His voice is immediately pleasing to the ear, with it's rock and roll undertones and occasional huskiness. \\"Dancing Through Life\\" showcases his talents quite effectively. <br /> <br />Joel Gray as the wizard is also quite remarkable, although his songs, \\"Sentimental Man\\" and \\"Wonderful\\" are not among the most memorable of the soundtrack. <br /> <br />The remaining characters and those of the company are also very extraordinary, and without them Wicked wouldn't be half the musical it is.  <br /> <br />Lastly, Stephen Swartz's music is mind-blowing, and the perfect accompaniment to such talented performers. It is the music that wells up in the listenner's mind and really enables Wicked to explode there. Wicked's lyrics fit this music wonderfully. <br /> <br />I haven't seen Wicked on stage, although I am going to New York this summer as my graduation present (I'm seventeen) and plan to see it there and also at the Pantageas in Hollywood when it comes in June.  I truly love this soundtrack, and I hope that on stage it will live up to all of my expectations. <br /> <br />The original cast is no longer with the on-stage production, so the soundtrack is the only way to truly witness the brilliance of Wicked as it was in the beginning. I reccomend it with all my heart.
0596007124|5.0|Lots of people told me that you must put GOF Design Patterns on your desk even though you can't understand it. But after reading the first 5 pages of Head First Design Patterns, I can't stop reading it. It explains the design patterns so clearly. It also tells you how and when to use them. This book is worth every penny you spent buying it. You can put this book on your desk and, at the same time, you can understand it and can discuss it with your colleagues. <br />I never gave a book 5 stars except this book.  <br />By the way, I spent more US$60 buying this book in Taiwan.
B00006879E|5.0|Songs about Jane by Maroon 5 is brilliant.There is not one song on   <br />the album that is not great. AND TO PROVE IT IT HAS BEEN IN THE CHART FOR 55 WEEKS AND STILL IN THE CHARTS. <br />IF YOU HAVE NOT GOT GET IT NOW AND LISTEN TO ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER.
B00004SVID|5.0|I'm not rating this album at 5 stars because I am obessesed with \\"The Wall\\". This album isn't even my favorite of the band. That honor goes to \\"Wish You Were Here\\".<br /><br />  That being said, this live album of The Wall is nothing short of amazing. As always, Pink Floyd puts on a super-tight dazzling performance, full of energy and technical prowess. I read a few reviews that have accused Pink Floyd of reverting to an \\"ordinary and boring run-of-the-mill\\" rock band upon the departure of founding member Syd Barrett. I think this is a complete lie. NOBODY sounds like Floyd, neither in their early years or their latter years. Some have said the concept of The Wall is boring and somewhat stupid, and have said it is nothing but Roger Waters on an ego trip. Again, this is BS. Yes, Roger Waters has his problems, but so do a lot of rock stars. I don't like his negativity and views on the band, but his concept was brilliant and well played out.<br /><br />  Now for the album itself. If you are a fan of The Wall, this is a MUST BUY. The studio version is, of course, excellent in its own right, but here, the band injects some energy and a little variation into the mix. \\"Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2\\" features some awesome guitar solos absent from the studio version, as well as the short but intense track \\"What Shall We Do Now?\\". The sound quality is perfect for the most part, as well it should be, seeing as how the tracks were recorded from a few shows held at Earls Court, which is revered among musicians as having exceptional acoustics. This album is best played LOUD. The musicianship and raw intensity of these concert tracks will send a few shivers down your spine.  Bottom line: If you are a fan of The Wall and own the studio album: BUY IT. If you are a fan of The Wall and DO NOT own the studio album (for some reason): BUY IT. Disregard the negative reviews, as they are mostly written by people who don't care for The Wall in the first place. Your comlpete and utter satisfaction are guaranteed!er satisfaction are guaranteed!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Over here in the UK, we're force fed fabricated pop and all such slush. To find something a little more musically mature, I frequently listen to Chicago's WTMX The Mix, which is where I 'discovered' Gavin Degraw. Chariot Stripped is a truly superb double CD. The studio album's great in the car, but the stripped version is a great late-night CD (i'm listening to it now!). I'm not a great fan of live albums, and this is certainly not a stage-managed, polished live performance, with crowd participation. But this is the great attraction: after just a couple of minutes, the band are there in your lounge. <br />I defy anyone not to be bowled over by Gavin's soulful voice and the band's amazing talent. But it, and if you're in the UK, spread the word!
B0000009S3|4.0|Hot Rats is a very good album with some marvelous compositions.  Peaches In Regalia is one of my favorite Zappa tunes, great melody.  The one vocal track by Don Van Vliet or Captain Beefheart as he is better known, is the hilarious rocking and sleezy Willie the Pimp.  Little Umbrellas is another stunning composition and I love Son of Mr. Green Genes.  The guitar playing and tone throughout are marvelous, Sugar Cane Harris is an excellent violin player, and the musicianship in general is top notch.<br /><br />Hot Rats was Zappa's first solo album and he used it to showcase his guitar virtuosity, mostly to good effect.  You could make a case for Hot Rats being an early fusion album and when I first heard this album in my teenage years I thought it was some of the most amazing guitar playing and jamming ever recorded.  But now, having heard quite a lot of music both jazz, avant garde ect. and having heard guitarists like Allan Holdsworth or John McLaughlin and jazz players of the caliber of Eric Dolphy or John Coltrane, I find that on many of the songs marathon jams, Zappa and company run out of new things to say halfway through and become a little noodly.  The playing is very good but gets a bit self-indulgent when the songs are extended the way they are, especially during the Gumbo Variations.  Some editing would have been nice and to be fair, John Coltrane could have used some editing too when he would play a 40+ minute version of Impressions.  In other words these are damn fine noodles, but noodles nonetheless.  Outside of improvisation length, and some people may really enjoy the extended jams, I'd say this is a very good album with strong compositions and playing and is well worth picking up.  Hot Rats is an excellent sampler of Frank's guitar style and jazz-rock compositional might circa 1969.  It's a snapshot of an exciting time in music when people were getting more adventurous and conflating differing styles.  People like Miles Davis and Frank Zappa were on the cutting edge of music back then and Hot Rats is a good example of what was blowing in the wind.ting edge of music back then and Hot Rats is a good example of what was blowing in the wind.
B000683VI4|5.0|A perfect romance movie. Young love that never dies. Simply excellent. Good soundtrack as well. A must see movie. A well justified tear jerker. Excellent, FYI grab the kleenex.
B0006399FS|1.0|Well its here finally and all that talk amounted up to alot more than this album does. <br /> <br />Whatever happeneed to the promised return to \\"rock n roll\\" and the old U2 sound that was updated, resulting in the best album that U2 have done????????? <br /> <br />The problem is, many people go  <br />\\"Awwww its a good album, music is music, if it sounds good it good.\\"  <br />Not always true, for you to have a good song you need good music as well as a good melody and tune - thats what makes a difference from songs in the charts and songs by artists who care about what they are actually doing it. Its quite ovious. <br /> <br />U2 have shown this!!! So why did'nt they make more of an effort on this album, \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" had songs that were miles better than this. \\"Kite\\" \\"When I look at the world\\" \\"Elevation\\" even \\"Walk On\\" and \\"Stuck in a moment\\". <br /> <br />This album is nothing more than over exposed trashy rubbish, that will not stand the test of time and I'm pretty sure in a few years everyone will be saying  <br />\\"well it was'nt that good was it?\\" <br /> <br />I think the real U2 fans have seen this already. <br />The biggest mistake U2 have ever made - end of story. <br />At least it will make them richer - so why don't they give us a refund!!! <br /> <br />Nothing but a big joke!!!
B000001DVD|5.0|I started listening to Def Leppard in 1987 when \\"Hysteria\\" came out (I was 12 years old) and later bought the bands entire catalog up to today.  Since I was more in-tune with the Pop/Metal genre of the late 80's I didn't fully appreciate what a great album \\"High N Dry\\" is.  I love big guitar sound on this album.  Songs like \\"Let it go\\", \\"Another hit and run\\" and \\"Switch 625\\" are classic.  The more raw and less polished Metal sound of the early 80's has been coming full circle as of late with bands like The Darkness and I find myself listening to this album more than ever before.  I think it would be wise for the band to come full circle as well.  The polished approach of the past 2 decades is becoming tiresome.  Def Leppard should make something more like High N Dry if they want to hit it big again.  Unpolished.  Raw.  Energetic.  High N Dry has stood the test of time.
B00000K3CM|5.0|Last time around, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) was left home alone (pun intended) by his family in a frantic hurry to get to the airport. And to add insult to injury, he had to deal with a couple of bumbling sillies--burglars who wanted to burglarize his house--who went by the name of the \\"Wet Bandits.\\" This time around, it's more of the same, but with a slight difference: this time, he gets on the wrong plane, and is left to his own devices in the \\"Big Apple\\"--a/k/a New York City.<br /><br />The plot is pretty similar to the last one in many ways: Kevin gets into trouble due to getting into it with his older brother, and is punished. He gets fed up with his family treating him unfairly, and in the midst of his angst, wishes that he could have a vacation on his own, without any of his family. The next morning, in a frantic hurry, the family rushes to the airport to go to Florida for Christmas vacation. In the airport, Kevin stops to put some batteries into his small camcorder (which will be largely significant later in the film), and as soon as he lifts his head, his family are long gone. He spots an older guy from the backside who looks like his dad, and therefore gets on the same plane as this gentleman, believing that it really was his dad. Needless to say, he was in for a big surprise when the plane landed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the \\"Wet Bandits\\" (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) escape from jail, and are in the \\"Big Apple\\" as well. You know what happens: they cross paths, and these two clowns are looking for revenge. The slapstick craziness that was seen in the last film, is taken up an extra notch, and is made gut-bustingly funnier as a result. (And again, just listening to Daniel Stern's demented operatic-like screeching as he gets his, alone, just slams the wind straight out of me. It's too hilarious!)<br /><br />As for poignant moments, last time around, the \\"scary\\" character was an old man who was rumored to be a murderer. This time, it's a homeless woman who dwells in Central Park, and her companions are a bunch of pigeons.<br /><br />These Home Alone films are recommended for anyone with a taste for over-the-top, outrageous slapstick humor, added with a large dose of mischief. Also recommended if you want to bring out the kid in you.r companions are a bunch of pigeons.

0143034901|4.0|As others have stated, this novel could have benefitted with a bit of editing here and there, and I wonder if the translation takes a bit away from the impact of the original Spanish.  But, I was entranced by the characters and the plot (I did figure out a big plot twist way before it happened; I thought it too obvious to be true).  There are many faults that could be pointed out in this work, but there are many wonderful moments as well.  One chapter in particular, which I won't mention for fear of spoiling things, I found to be absolutely hypnotic and breathtaking.  I hope more of Zafon's books are translated into English, and soon.
