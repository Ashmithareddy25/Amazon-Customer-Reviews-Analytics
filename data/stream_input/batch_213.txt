B00949DNDO|5|I love this sunscreen. I use it on my face and it feels great. Non-greasy but hydrating. I have a friend who is super picky about what they use on their face and they were forced to use this because we were out on vacation and they were quickly asking me where I bought it because they wanted some for themselves... that's how good this stuff is! & super cheap for how much you get!
B0020MMCJI|5|More better smelling than I thought- Had used about two years ago
B009XUEQGM|5|I love these steripods! It is the 2nd set I have bought, and will continue to use them.<br />Once you get started using them, you get used to putting it back and keeping it safe and sanitized in there.<br />It is great for travel, and great for your bathroom! I use it on the go, and if I happen to carry a toothbrush with me in a makeup bag, it stays put and great to take with me with my floss.<br />:)
B004L18FY2|5|Some of the best products around, I have very frizzy thick curly hair, And the shampoo conditioner is awesome, I also like the leave in which makes my curls look great!! I get a lot of compliments when i have used this stuff.
B0049LUI9O|5|Really good and essential thing for every man. Works great and doing it's job just perfect!
B00FITKIDM|4|Using this with my Braun electric toothbrush I was able to remove some of what I missed with the excellent &#34;Dental Tartar Scraper and Remover Set, SS&#34;.  Perhaps a hygienist could comment on how wise this is, as it could be too aggressive.
B00763LZF8|3|Nice for sensitive teeth... plastic isn't super strong.
B0067F28ZW|4|Bought this brush set for a surprise gift for my girlfriend. She had been complaining she needed some new brushes. She loves them. Great product.
B00AW2LUXM|1|This stuff does not work. it does not do what they said it would.  I used it more than they said I had to and I still got those lines in my FACE. Dont buy it . It is a waste of money. This does not even tighten your skin, there is no firming at all when used.  I focused on one area it looks the same as it did when I started.
B004QJ8Y72|5|This product is awesome on my lips! I use it morning and evening. It doesn't wash off if I eat or drink something within half an hour of using it. My lips stay plump and full 24-7! Am using up my other eye creme, then will start using on my eyes as well - I'm sure it will be all I need for both areas of concern.    BTW, all of philosophy's products are incredible!
B00PFCTVH6|1|just did not live up to write up on internet
B00CFZJMFM|1|First things first: The cooling bar is truly amazing. The sensation it creates absolutely helps fight skin irritation and it reduces friction.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for as terrific as the cooling system is, the shave this model provides is TERRIBLE. It struggles with handling some five o'clock stubble. If you have any facial hair longer than a few millimeters, prepare to spend a great deal of time trying to get a close shave. At which point you'll just give up.<br /><br />I respect (and as a tech-y early adopter appreciate) the innovation of this model, but this is first an foremost a shaving device. As such, it can not be recommended.<br /><br />I had previously been using the top of the line Panasonic model, which despite it's awful cleaning system and terrible customer support, provides a markedly closer shave.
B001GFCV32|5|great products!!!
B004AW3GQE|5|I've been using this cream for years.  It's a well-made, simple, rich face cream, no irritants, costing maybe 10% of equivalent products.  Much easier to buy through Amazon.
B00G3LRFZ8|5|Healthy ingredients! It's made in the US and uses birch xylitol from sustainable forests. The xylitol gives a pleasantly sweet flavor for a long time. It does not promote tooth decay like regularly-sweetened gums do. It has no artificial sweeteners or other scary chemicals. It is even GMO-free.I have a condition that causes dry mouth, so I have been using this gum for years. Maybe if more people buy it, the price will come down!  :-)
B0013MU3C4|4|Really good bronzer for the money-love the color! It goes on nicely and like that you can adjust the color by adding more if needed.
B00GUS926O|5|Great everybody should use it
B004V3QYRU|4|Great lift that lasts until your next wash.
B003S56KNK|1|I believe these may have been counterfeit!
B000O5UWTA|2|I followed the instruction but didn't see any difference. I keep using twice a weeks for 2 months, keeping Nitlonger each time and still no effect on my hair (more effect on my curtain shower ;-b<br />I'm still golden blond when I wished I was more ash blonde.<br />Oh well, I tried.
B00HHG1LHQ|5|The only body wash that doesn't aggravate my eczema.
B0050HO9MI|5|Worth it if you don't have a bit budget
B0032NK1II|5|ok
B00HQ214U0|5|i love how it looks it covers up all day!, at first when you put it on it may be thick but it like melts down and become creamy and soft, it may crease when u first put it on i just spread it again a lil and it stops creasing i think that is just cause it needs to dry a little but its nothing no harm i love it, it covers my dark circles and honestly i feel beautiful cause im young and have dark eye circles n this covers it all day, i recommend it and it came like a week and a half before it said it would come so that is great too.
B005DKKBUG|5|My fiance had an older version of this razor and it broke, so he hasn't been able to use it very much. He loves this one so much better than the old version! He says that it gets but closer and doesn't take as long. He also loves being able to see the charge left in it, that way he doesn't get caught halfway through his shave with dead battery. Also, you don't need the whole cleaning unit in order to charge the razor, which saves a lot of space. Thankfully his old cleaning cartridges fit into this model, so no wasted money. Very nice!!
B00NR4BIZM|5|Great eye cream. I alternate between this and an eye serum and i have zero dark circles or puffiness. Two thumbs up.
B002TQ2EW0|5|My 1 year old daughter kept getting little dry patches with red blotches on the apple of her cheeks and I had gotten this product in a sample pack and put it on her face and it cleared it up within hours. I think she was getting the rash from washing her face. Our city water is very hard and i think irritated her sensitive skin. I now put it on everyday and have no problems anymore. Highly recommend!
B004INQ65S|5|Again, a Christmas gift.  Although not the exact one my daughter requested it looks like it may be better than she wanted!
B0011NM8QO|5|Great Great Great don't miss out on this Product I'm 50 years old take my word this works, already told friends and family  Thanks
B005L87XAG|5|Works very well, no iratation or dryness. I highly recommend it. It lasted about 2 months, using it probably 3-4 times a week.
B002Z7FV3M|5|love it
B009ZVNZIE|2|I do not like this eye roller. Thus, I was motivated to order the electric derma pen just because this roller tends to break the epidermis as it rolls and the needles are just too thick. It is sturdy but it does leaves some marks even when rolled lightly.
B00MPXP8AW|2|Unfortunately this Shea Butter had an awful smell that was not bearable at all. I could not imagine making any lip balms or lotions from this as the smell would overpower any essential oil I would have had to add by the tablespoons!<br /><br />I don't know if the strong smell is natural and to be expected, but just wanted to put it out there so other buyers are aware.<br /><br />Apart from that the shipping was super quick and the packaging nice, it even came with a nice wooden spatula but overall I could not use the Shea butter simply due to the stringent smell.
B000VVT94G|3|After some time using this it now rips hair out as it cuts more and more often. Mostly because it must be used MUCH slower than when it was bought. Will be getting something else soon. Not another one of these.
B002XXAUE8|1|With so many products from China containing Lead -- and other questionable ingredients -- you might want to think twice about putting this stuff on your face, lips and in your eyes.
B00K7HVHYE|5|Small, discrete but potent. This product actually contains a good amount of active ingridients that work as anti-aging agents for its size, it's easy to use and the results are remarkable.
B00BDJFLT2|2|I had samples of the shampoo/conditioner that I loved. However, I feel like the formula for the 33 oz is different- can the size be a factor? I'm not sure, but if you are buying these based off the little travel sized samples, I would not get this.
B00D6EDGZI|3|I have been using the medium shade, and I find the product to be okay.  I do wear foundation, and on days that I don't want to wear it, using this cream does an okay job of not making look bleak!! I like putting it on under my make up, but I wouldn't really use it alone.
B006GQYSDC|5|For under $20, this done a great job. While not too close, it definitely makes you presentable. Can't go wrong with this one.
B002TQ4AO0|5|Thanks. It was exactly what he was looking for.  Made a perfect gift. And was much cheaper than at the stores.
B00E96XELS|5|This cream is a dream! It is light, comfortable and readily absorbed. It is easing fine lines around my eyes and my dark circles are diminishing. Would recommend to anyone needing help with their aging skin.
B00BB8ZHJE|5|Perfection :) My friend had this curler and I used it....then needed one myself. So glad I could find a deal and it was exactly what I expected and wanted :) Thank you :)
B00KWPRA0G|2|I like old version better.<br />This one make my face tooo fake like using foundation .<br />Also one pumping was way to much. hard to figure out perfect amount .
B0009RF8G0|4|We never get rashes anymore! Yay! I wish it was less messy though
B002BWOY20|5|Love this product really clears my dark spots
B001LF2VUA|5|I used this product every day when I was pregnant.  I have 2 kids and used it both times.  This product works wonders because even after 2 pregnancies, I have absolutely NO stretch marks!  I am a firm believer in this product and highly recommend this to ANY mom-to-be!
B005MIFIQG|1|Didn't make a noticeable different but did turn my healthy hair into straw. If you must buy I would suggest going to target because it's only $5. But again, I don't recommend.
B00697VGIS|1|Does not feel like human afro hair at all. I tried using it for deadlock extensions, they looked terrible....Don't waste your money.
B006KXW9YG|1|I am not happy with this product.  I have not seen any improvement, but it has dried out my skin.  I always use vitamin E oil with it.  I actually would like a refund.
B00RJIS4GI|4|Very comfortable to wear, even while sleeping on my side. A little light would shine through the bottom of my mask, perhaps the padding on the bottom can be beefed up a little. I wore this through a long international flight and several hostels to block out light. The included earplugs are useless, I wouldn't use them again.
B004Y9M740|3|I bought these to get the &#34;falsies flared&#34; look and it works okay but does not make you look like you have false lashes.
B002XQ1TZY|5|love it
B004DPS5V4|2|This is a detail review of my experience w/ Keratin Cure, so get ready...  I am a black/african american woman with 4b possibly 4c type bra strap length hair.  Currently, my hair is relaxed, but I am 6 weeks post relaxer.  I purchased this product to aid in my transition from relaxed to natural to promote manageability and prevent breakage.    I did the Keratin Cure treatment on my 5th week post relaxer.  Since my hair was in a fragile condition, the night b/4 I did the treatment, I washed my hair with a moisturizing poo and deep con w/ plastic cap under dryer for 20 min. The day of the treatment, I washed twice w/ clarifying poo. I let my hair air dry instead of blow dry b/c clarifying poos tend to dry out my hair so blow drying would only add to the problem.  Once, my hair was totally dry, I parted my hair in 4 sections, poured 2 oz. of treatment in a color bowl and began apply it with color brush in small sections from the roots. The treatment had an overwhelming scent of chocolate.  It also had the consistency of a light conditioner. The application was easy but it took longer than I expected. I still had some treatment in the color bowl so I applied it the the ends of my hair.   The instructions provide (and from what I saw in youtube vdo's) that you blow dry your hair with the treatment in it. This was impossible for me to do! My hair was almost dry by the time I was ready to blow dry it. More importantly, it was rough to the point that it was difficult part it.  I read another review (I don't remember where) that someone described it as sticky. Well, my hair wasn't sticky it was just rough and dry. If I blow dried it, I probably wouldn't have hair on my head! Nevertheless, I didn't panic; I just let it air dry. Once it was dry, I began the difficult task of parting my hair to flat iron it. I used the Izunami 450 Tourmaline flat iron (which is fabulous) set at 450 degress F and tried to get as close to my scalp as possible. I did about 7-10 passes on the rootsand about 4-6 passes on my relaxed hair to prevent heat damage. When I flat ironed my ends it sizzled and smelt like burnt hair. Now, I'm regretting putting the extra treatment on my ends. After this process, my hair looked dull and felt stiff.    The last step was to wash w/ sulfate free poo. I washed my hair and it felt smooth and soft. Moreover, when I applied a sulfate free conditioner it added to the softness. I combed my hair and did a roller set. I noticed minimal breakage/shedding. Once my hair was dry it was still soft and had tremendous shine.    It's been a week since the treatment and I am disapointed. I've since washed my hair and it feels like a lot of the treatment was washed away. My hair is not as soft or shiny as it was only a week ago and it tangles easily. Also, it was as if the keratin never took to the roots! It didn't loosen the curl pattern at all which was what I looked forward to the most. The good points are that in the application I didn't smell fumes as described w/ other keratin treatments and I noticed that I didn't have the breakage I would have 6 weeks post relaxer (I generally relax my hair every 6 weeks by the 6 week my hair is shedding/breaking all over the place).  All in all, I would not recommend this treatment to anyone with 4 type hair if your are in transition and looking to loosen the curl pattern and for manageablity. I may work better for those who don't have coarse hair or a tight curl pattern.  Since I have almost a full bottle of this stuff I will continue to use this to soften my hair but I am going to try another same day keratin treatment possibly QOD Max to loosen the curl pattern.
B002FCH4B4|4|I have to admit, this stuff makes far more bubbles than the cheap knock-offs. And the bubbles stick around in the tub longer. It also smells really good; brings back childhood memories.
B00GOG6X7S|5|Love this stuff! Retails on website and mall at $50...so yeah a great bargain and an excellent product
B007KPUSJG|5|I live in Colorado and this shampoo and conditioner help my hair stair hydrated and moisturized. Other products used have left my hair in a frizz, but not Goldwell!
B00QEGP4JQ|5|This sea salt spray is great! After showering, I like to spritz my hair while it's wet, which gives me nice beachy waves after I mess with it.
B003B6LJPK|5|I have been a stylist for over 25 years and have used this comb for over ten years.  You can't beat the quality of this weave comb.  I have used cheaper, more flimsy styles and they don't last.  The only reason I have had to replace one of these combs is because I have dropped it the wrong way and it broke a tooth.  (This rarely happens - It took a LOT of drops before it finally chipped).<br /><br />With this weave comb you have complete control from partings to fine or chunky highlights.  You can save a lot of time when doing a highlight application since this comb &#34;weaves&#34; the hair in one quick motion.  It works similar to a loom that weaves fabric.<br /><br />I highly recommend this comb for any stylist that wants a quick, beautiful and consistent highlight application for their clients.
B001FYV87O|5|A great product
B00EOB0042|5|I have tried every natural deodorant I could find and they all make me smell like fried food once I start sweating.<br />The difference with this product is that it's made with coconut oil instead of a food grade vegetable oil.<br />It has no odor and out performs the best of any chemical ridden name brand deodorant I've ever used. I even put it to the test by working two consecutive days in the garden in 90 degree temps without a shower in between!  One application lasted two days and NO B.O. !!!!
B0009OAHH8|5|i bought it for my dad even though its for woman<br />he loves it he only uses it for special occasion<br />but its great : )
B002UUT3YM|4|The facial scrub is not as effective as Philosophy's Purity therefore I would not purchase this again.Otherwise the creams are fine.
B00CNTJHQO|4|Liked it.  Seemed to sooth the scalp.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|Gets all of the food between my teeth that a toothbrush misses. Makes for healthy gums.
B000VTQCIY|2|It exploed so I couldn't use it but they refunded me so I gave them 2 stars
B009RNUH4A|4|I received a can of this for free in my Influenster VoxBox. I'm not a lotion person because I can't stand how slimy it feels on my skin. When I opened my box and saw this, I was excited to give it a try. The Spray & Go moisturizer goes on just like spray sunscreen and absorbs quickly. The application is fast and the moisture is apparent, even after such quick absorption. I'll definitely be buying this regularly after my free sample runs out.
B0016O92LW|5|Very sparkly (slightly blue in colour, depending on the light), with the added bonus of washing off easily. Some products linger for ages (when it comes to glitter), but this one will actually come off when you want it to! The design (putting the glitter inside a massage-bar-like product) makes it easy to evenly distribute the sparkles, and to apply them where you *want* them (eg: arms but not face, or face but not shoulders/neck).     The only downside, is that the glitter can also come off on things like furniture, the cat, and your clothing. (But it washes out, later.)
B009I3C8P0|5|There's no ways around it, this is good stuff.
B004I4ITXE|5|Works perfectly and leaves my hair very silky.
B00538TSMU|5|I love these lashes! Great quality at a great price. I will definitely purchase them again.
B001AWG0A6|5|This is a wonderful product for sensitive dry mature skin. I have to be very careful because I have reactions to a lot of ingredients. I will certainly buy this again
B00N5N5KZO|5|This tool is awesome.  I have thick, coarse, colored hair.  With the first use, I saw softness I had not ever seen in my hair with using a flat iron.  I liked the 2-way rotation which really helps when styling the opposite side of my head and not having an issue of trying to capture hair easily.  This product does what it says and more.  I cannot recommend it enough to those who want straightened, soft hair.  I haven't used it yet to curl, but am anxious to try that, too.  The trick is to move through the hair slowly to let the rotating barrel do its job.  I have searched a long time for a styling tool that is very portable, does what it says it will, does not damage hair, and gets my hair looking professionally styled.  This is a winner.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy again or give as a gift.  I am pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to use and the results on my hair couldn't have been better.  Thanks for a great product... flat irons should go away and flocked curlers, too.  This is the only hair styling tool needed as far as I'm concerned.
B000ICRDSW|1|Used this for several months, and noticed no change at all to my skin. Then I accidentally bumped it against the coffee table and the glass tip shattered.
B001G5HZCY|5|Been using this brand for years great product.
B001E96M94|5|USE THIS EVERY NIGHT.  LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS AND IT KEEPS MY HANDS NICE AND SOFT.  WILL BUY AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT OF THIS.
B003YJCU0W|5|I first tried the Unite products as samples from a beauty salon and I really liked them.  The conditioner makes your hair soft and shiny.  Great product.
B00AO6ULE0|4|It's a pretty wig.. just a bit smaller than I thought it would be.
B0085A18A8|5|I gave this away as a present along with 2 other Panasonic ladies' products. I actully had the chance to use it few times and the trimmer does get really close to the skin and leaves no stubble. Quality seems good too.<br /><br />Unlike other facial trimmers in the market, this one is very discreet and comes in a nice case. No one would ever know it's a facial trimmer, which is one of the reasons I bought it. It also matches perfectly with the other two beauty tools. I wish they sold them as a set!
B001ECQ7G4|5|This is the best product ive ever used after tying so many other products.  Im so glad that I've found this product, I will continue to be a loyal customer.
B00MF1X0JA|3|Ok
B00JWFOBVI|3|It's very cute and cheap, but the problem is that the metal changes color pretty quickly and makes it look dull..when I got it, it was a nice gold color, but within the span of about a month it's now a copper-ish type tint. Not a total waste of money, though. I'll still wear it and see if there's something I can do about the color.
B008YMHXRE|1|This is a terrible product, says right on the bottle not to be used for massage and not a lubricant...very sticky even the next morning!!
B000TLSBTM|5|Have use it before it is great that's why I bought it again.
B00547H22S|5|This is great for scars! I started using one weak after my thyroid surgery and my scar is looking great! However, it doesn't stick really well, maybe because the neck skin move so much! Anyways really good product!
B004CDTDTK|1|My 4 yr old Grand Daughter had over a half a can put on her in one afternoon! That enening she was VERY RED! The NEXT DAY my Daughter had to take her to the Dr. due to Blisters were already apperaing on her Shoulder! Long Story Short. She has been through total HELL! Second-Third Degree Burn. Been knocked out at the Hospital to have it Cleaned DEEPLY due to the infection that set in, in a Matter of hours! She has to see a Burm Spec. for PT! She is Terrified to go outside, in fear that she will get burned again! She starts school this year and will not beable to go outside untill we can work her through her fears! Would You Believe that the Company had the Nerve to send her Coupons for more of their CRAP!!!!!!!! I hope that this COMPANY Goes out of BUSINESS!!!!!!!
B001E5ECMM|5|Loved this coloring product! Very easy to use and the color has lasted without too much fading. Definitely recommend for someone trying to avoid the salon prices while still getting the best color possible!
B0030ZRSHK|5|works well
B001VEK1IU|5|Tried off-brand replacement products which did not measure up to the quality (or last as long) as Braun's.  Buying Braun's from now on.
B0031AZK4W|5|I bought this close to Christmas and was afraid it wouldn't come by then. But it came right in time!
B006ILBJD2|5|Jeffery James Botanicals are the BEST 100 per cent I am very very happy my skin feels and looks Great every women should try using this line you will see a great difference on your skin😊😍
B00AS5IVNK|5|This smells completely natural, very soft and clean.  Yet so concentrated, you only need a few drops.  It is great for travel when you have to pack everything into a quart size bag.
B003GU46VK|5|First few uses I didn't notice much but after a week my 'whiteness' seemed to start building up and getting whiter daily. I can safely say this eliminated most of my coffee staining and just years of tooth age in about 2 weeks of nightly use. Enough shades that most everyone I know noticed!
B002R2E16S|5|This product is fabulous!! I have used this on 2 of my tattoos and the product is a great way to take care of a tattoo. I won't use anything else! And the price is much cheaper here than buying direct from the manufacturer :-)
B0019QHUTI|5|one of my favorites !! of coarse you walk around bright red for a couple hrs my tan looks amazing and very quickly !!
B000GGKPV2|5|Its way cheaper than going to the dental lab for a quick fix.  After I used this product to fix a tooth that came out of my denture<br />I made an appt. with the dentist.  When I told him what I used to fix the tooth, he sent me home stating that this product was the same product that the dental lab uses & he would have to rebreak the tooth/plate if I insisted they fix it. Great product.
B002XHJHV6|5|I use for years. It is a perfect base.
B000CSYYZM|5|After bleaching my hair it turned out really brassy.  I read the reviews and thought I would try it.  So glad I did.  The color is absolutely beautiful now.
B00113FWRG|4|I absolutely LOVE the Lavendar and Sore Muscle scents, but I am off and on with how I like the Relax scent(reason for deducting one star). Nonetheless, I would purchase this set again. The sore muscle alone is worth the purchase!
B005TW5N0G|5|I use this to help protect my hair from heat tools. So far so good. Kerastase products in general are really great and while you can't &#34;tell&#34; that it's working... there's no burning smell as I iron my hair or anything like that
B008C12X0O|5|Great colors!!
B00P9IKDGY|5|The Bare Escentuals name holds a high status in this household and so does this product! It certainly lived up to its reputation. I loved the clean feeling that my face had and the product did not dry out my skin as some can do! I did receive this product at a discounted price for my unbiased opinion.
B00JTY6WQ4|4|Too soon to see resultts
B008PEMBNC|5|Works well, keeps my teeth clean.  I like that it tells you to switch to another section of your mouth by vibrating every 30 seconds.  Replacements heads are a little pricey though.
B00317FT2S|5|these eyebrow shapers are excellent for a quick shaping. They work great and are also very good quality. I recommend them.
B0089UF76A|5|The BEST sunblock I have ever used, bar none. I bought this on the recommendation of my dermatologist, as I have rosacia and very sensitive skin. One note: this product goes on thick, and takes a while (at least 1-2 minutes) to rub in, but it lasts and really protects with natural zinc and titanium oxide, not harsh chemicals found in so many other products. Highly recommended for all ages.
B00433QUMW|2|It is ok. Nothing fantastic happening around my eyes. There are other products that are cheaper that do the same thing.Not a good value for the price.
B002XQ1R6U|5|it was perfect for a Christmas gift. my brother satisifed, smells delicious .. I came in perfect condition. recommend this product
B000MS1YKK|4|I have always gotten this lotion from stores and have loved it. The shipping was very quick. Impressed
B007XJM9EQ|5|Great selection
B003NXGZ50|5|Wonderful lotion and body gel,  have reordered already.
B00005B6ZH|5|Let's face it: you can't rake an electric shaver over your skin and expect it to do the same job as a plain old razor. But then again, electric shavers typically don't leave you with painful nicks and razor burn! I read the directions carefully before using this product, and found that using it with warm water and shaving gel was optimal. I have had no problems with the charge running out and I find the unit easy to disassemble and to clean. There are three levels for shaving, depending on the length of hair- which is a very accommodating feature to have. I would say that if you want the closest shave possible, stick with a razor, but if you are willing to settle for the next best thing (electric), this shaver does the job very well.
B00027CCCU|5|As always my favorite tooth brush :)!!!
B0050OC180|5|i have really crazy hair this tames it into soft spirals  love love it
B00684RTY2|5|I have every color of this nail polish and I love it on my nails it last for two to three weeks but I do know that's not for everyone my daughter gets a few days and my mom gets a few hours but for me I have very dry nails and I think this is what makes it adhere to my nails for so long and I also do it at night before bed and let dry all night before I ever get water on my nails . My favorite colors is hot chocalote and glazed donuts with glitter color over it .
B00RXIW38Y|3|Too clumpy. Other Neutrogena product has been silky on my lashes but this was not.
B00027DMI8|5|Product as promised, works well and noticeable improvement in skin. Will continue to use this product.
B00ANZOVAW|2|Does not really clear my beard completely, my good old philips did a much better job, and that stuff was 8 yrs old.
B00EA5A9BQ|3|This polish is great. I only gave it 3 stars cause I wasn't crazy about this color.
B00021CR8K|5|This is my favorite perfume i have ever had before!  <br />My mom wants this for Christmas and shes been using my whole bottle! You may think that im a kid and i will say that but i am a HUGE KENZO FAN! I love her dearly and i say that this is the best perfume she ever made before. U gotta give the girl credit! I love this perfume. This is not a waste of money and the reviews are right they don't stay that long but i dont care because u may not smell it strong but that is because this fragrance is eligant and beautiful! I LOVE IT. I bet you would to! It is sooooooooo not a waste of money! <br /> <br />
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Looks great on my bathroom counter and supports my razor and brush perfectly. And at a very reasonable price. I recommend it!
B007FJ1KKS|5|This item is wonderful - easy to go on and washes off easily with my 100% pure cleanser.  Love, love, love this eye liner.
B002Z371IE|4|i am not through with it but i can see results with this product. so i am satisfied with it
B00176BGMC|4|Work great
B005C2NAKS|2|Love the lotion but have a hard time getting it out of bottle
B00KP5TS4Y|3|Doesn't work as easy as it looks
B00B0S7KUY|3|I am just not sure on this.  It does hurt on my upper lip.  And I only have a few dark hairs here and there, being it only works on dark hair kind of expensive for that.
B003FO70Z6|5|Great Product
B00MYIIWP6|2|It arrived broken!
B000KOUCQ8|4|This product is great. It works great, goes on smooth, and smells good. I have spots on my arms and legs from mosquito bites and the cream fading the spots.
B008532DIG|3|work great must follow instruction took two try that why 3 stars adding salt make it darker but one spot gray turn dark green will re-buy to maintain
B000VBKHTM|5|I will have to order another soap puck just to have one handy in case they get rid of this. Even though this may last awhile.
B00A3PJLD4|5|Very satisfied with these products makes for doing mine, and my daughters nails much easier when we put characters on them.
B00J11SZS8|5|Love the feel of this.
B009GKI6N8|5|Fantastic! My hair was a mess till I purchased and installed this in my shower.  I have always had lovely hair till I recently moved to a city that apparently has hard water.  Nothing helped till I bought this.  Now my hair is much softer and manageable.  50.00 well spent!!!!
B004TSFE6Y|5|I am using this brush for my blushes and it is definitely amazing! It gives the most natural flush ever! I use it for both cream and powder blushes. I have a small face and small cheeks but this one fits perfect.
B007XA49O8|5|I have 3c/4a fine hair and I am black.  This is my favorite oil.  I have also tried sweet almond oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and shea butter; but Avocado Oil makes my hair feel the healthiest and is one of the easiest to use (i.e., no melting required).  Now, I usually either use it as a sealant or mix it with olive oil, essential oils and water as a daily moisturizer.
B00IDWP4IA|5|I'm glad I gave this product a try. It comes in a convenient bottle. Smells lightly like orange, which i love. Absorbed quickly into the skin after face washed. There are no sticky feeling afterwards. Highly recommend.
B0093T081K|5|I buy this all the time
B000ICRDSW|5|My old one finally died.  It worked for eight years.  I love this machine.  People are always surprised to learn I am 67 years old.  They think I am in my mid-40s.  Sweet.
B002XQ1YTA|1|tried to cancel the day it was ordered but no avail it was shipped so i returned it because it because it was  was a fake product all three items I don't even know what was in the perfume but it wasn't juicy couture same with the lotion and shampoo. very upset this seller is horrible waste of $40.00
B00KHH2VOY|5|It's very nice.  Haven't really used it long enough to know personally how good it is, but I've heard only good things about this product so far (from family).
B00147FGJ8|2|Most of these reviews are fake, like every other review on amazon /: But this stuff is just like every other tanning lotion that comes in a cool hip bottle. It smells like tanning lotion, nothing special about it. Unless you put the lotion on one leg and not the other to test the results...then you can't say \\" It's the best tanning lotion ever!!! \\"
B00QSG3BEC|5|Great product !
B003BLBLVC|5|Wife loves the smell!! Still to expensive! Very pleased with the fragrance
B002E0QLP2|5|Great product !! love it!
B000YHSZ2E|5|and order came fast, and they last a long time - there is 4 of us that use it and last 2 months
B0001LQGG0|5|I love these razor cartridges. I hate body hair and I use these to shave pretty much everywhere. These have been the best blades I've found for my sensitive skin. I shave often and these blades last longer than I expect blades to usually last and I rarely get nicks/cuts.
B000W2XZWQ|5|I mix this lotion with hydrocortisone cream every morning and at night with a dark spot corrector and have noticed a total transformation in my skin.  I have used every lotion in the world, the expensive stuff from department stoires.... dermalogica...OBAGI...etc etc etc... it's exhausting to think of the amount of money I have wasted.  This is my favorite lotion by far, and much better than the one with a higher SPF.
B004HPQQ0C|5|I think cramp 911 is a gift from the gods.  Chemo and radiation brought on horrible leg and thigh cramps almost every night and also during the day.  I was miserable until I found this online and ordered a few bottles.  It relieves even my worse cramps within 20 seconds and the peace of mind this gives me is indescribable.<br />I have found that it doesn't work as well on foot and ankle cramps-and for that I use Hyland's cream.  It takes a couple of minutes to work-but it does a good job for those areas.<br />I want to add that this seller has great customer service.  When I experienced a small problem with my order they immediately offered to refund or replace the bottle. I opted for replacement and received the new bottle very fast.  Very impressed.
B001ET7HAM|5|My hygienist recommended that I switch to an SLS-free toothpaste when I started getting really bad canker sores (aka aphthous ulcers, and not to be confused with cold sores). Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that's used in nearly all toothpastes (not to mention shampoos and other washes) on the market.     It took me a few years of struggling before I happened upon this toothpaste. Most other SLS-free toothpastes on the market are \\"natural\\" (though Toms of Maine uses SLS) and a lot of them are slimy. Furthermore, many use cinnamon as a flavoring, which can also be irritating. This toothpaste foams nicely and tastes pleasant. I've been using it for several years now and it's the number one factor in controlling my canker sores.     I can see that some people have complained about this toothpaste as compared to other \\"sensitive\\" toothpastes, and apparently it's not stellar, but I prefer it to the other varieties of Sensodyne. I can definitely say though that for SLS-free options, I've found nothing better.
B00JQP1SP6|5|Absolutely love it!!!! i use it as as a belly wrap to reduce inches and it actually does that...its not a miracle worker u wont have a flat stomach the instant you use it but i do notice a marked difference when i use it...i mix it with french green clay and wrap with saran wrap an then bandage wrap an leave it on for an hour...i also use some on the cellulite on my thighs and my legs are now a little smoother...hopefully with continued use it will get rid of them totally...will definitely buy again
B001B87SFA|5|Nag Champa Natural Soap has been my favorite soap for many years. And when I buy the 4 pack, I get free travel bars to put in my overnite case. Great incense too.
B000NYL3NQ|5|Every since I discovered this product, it has been love at first pump. I have gone without it because I didn't want to spend the money and whenever I get it back and use it for the first time in a while, my hair is instantly transformed.<br /><br />I have thick, curly, coarse hair. If I wear my hair curly with mousse, I put in a couple pumps of this after and it eliminates frizz and makes my curls soft and touchable. If I am straightening my hair, it makes it look so shiny and smooth (my hair is dull and frizzy naturally). If I just let my hair air dry, while my hair isn't real pretty to look at, at least it's soft and not frizzy!<br /><br />I have very thick hair which takes forever to dry and this cuts BLOWDRYING TIME IN HALF! How it does it, I will never know but it's fabulous!<br /><br />It also smells fantastic!<br /><br />I have very long and thick hair- 3 pumps out of the shower, 1 pump on finished hair for a polish up.
B000HM8SF0|1|I have made a choice to avoid personal products made in China.  You should let customers know these are from China.
B004G7NDKM|5|This is a great product. It really smooths my hands. Also had a nice smell too. I would recommend it.
B00MWW74FS|5|Great product to take care of your feet.
B0082ZD63S|5|I love this stuff!! It keeps my skin smooth and it absorbs really well. A little goes a long way, too!
B0041U2T7C|5|Now has the best oils out there. Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils. Love the scent in my soaps.
B0017K9WVK|5|This gloss is superb.  Silky smooth and gives the right amount of color.  I use it over other lipsticks and it really gives a nice radiance to my lips.  I never tried a blended gloss with 3 different colors but this one has me sold forever!!  It is just the right color for all my summer fashion looks.
B001BNI6M4|5|Thanks a lot! I love it!
B00E87QZWS|5|I am on my 2nd bottle now and couldn't be happier.  I started noticing results after 4 days.  My coworkers were commenting how good I looked.  That felt really great!  I lost weight recently so I had some lines on my face, cheeks and forehead.  This serum really smoothed them out.  People are using words like vibrant and radiant for my look.  It really makes me feel good.  This is so worth it to me.
B0012F97EM|5|Great product... just the right size to fit at least 2 items if needed.  Heats up really fast and works very well.
B008XLLGBU|1|I ordered thinking I was going to get all pink for my daughter spa Party an I received multi-colors ones as well but before they came in I ordered anothe pack.They have not came in yet, but I won't be surprised if they are the same. They will be returned... False advertisement 👎
B0089GBCEK|5|value
B003I0MHEG|1|This VICCO product is usually very good, and I purchase it often locally, but I threw away this particular order.  I received 1.76 ounces instead of the 2.12 ounces that was listed for sale, 20 percent less than was ordered, according to the manufacturer's label which shows 50 grams. (2.12 ounces is 60 grams).  Manufacturer's label also says &#34;FOR SALE ONLY IN INDIA, MAURITIUS AND SAARC COUNTRIES&#34;, but I am in the USA.  Manufacturers label also lists ingredients that are totally different from the US version that I buy locally for lower net price.  Because of these issues, I decided to not trust this particular shipment so discarded it.  BUYER BEWARE.
B00H05VXVS|1|I received it and it didn't work,I tried several battery changes but it wouldn't work.
B00GHNOQ54|5|Super impressed with these beautiful and unique polishes!  They are exactly as they are described.  Gorgeous multi-chromes that shift several different colors depending on the light.  And then add on top of that a strong linear holographic effect.  What you get is an incredible and unique polish that applies like a dream.  I didn't find it as sheer as some described, I could get away with 2 coats but did do 3 for good measure.  But each layer was smooth and perfect.  I LOVE this polish!!!
B0065ZC4XA|5|Wow! It's way more than what I was expecting! The colors go on perfectly, AND lasts all day! Very, very, very happy. I'll definitely be purchasing more e.l.f. products. I'm just loving it!
B0030O9LYY|3|* The NYX Eyeshadow Base may keep the eyeshadow on, but for me it feels too dry  * If I use this, I will add a layer of my too faced primer or the Studio Gear Primer  * But a good price for an eye base
B00NAIM3H2|1|NOT worth the money. Should have stuck to buying what I always have L'Oreal's Tanning Wipes are the best. The 1st package I used from this barely showed, then tried the 2nd, 3rd, then just threw the entire box away.
B001J9JKQQ|4|Good item and cheaper than others
B002SIBZNS|5|This green is very pretty on its own or it could be perfect over black too.<br />I was expecting mirror like effect like the picture, but ot's just regular shine upon drying. Still pretty green.
B000RE8GYG|5|I have had a problem for many years with horrible coarse chin and upper lip hairs that just seemed to be getting worse as I aged. It started out as one or two in my twenties and eventually grew into a large patch on my chin. Lasers don't work for me because I'm fair.  I tried electrolysis, but it was going to be multiple visits at $25/hour, and she just talked nonstop which I didn't like because it seemed to waste a lot of time (at $25/hour).  So I didn't go back.  I couldn't pluck the hairs because they would become ingrown.  So I just resigned myself to shaving them everyday.  But I could always feel the stubble which bothered me and they would sometimes become ingrown too.  Then along came NoNo, which I excitedly bought thinking this would solve my problem.  Well after using NoNo for over six months I noticed it did help in that I seemed to have less whiskers, but there were still a lot (and new ones sprouting out all the time) and after  years of using it nothing much changed and  I continued to have to shave everyday and I still suffered from ingrown hairs quite often. Then about six months ago I did an online search for hair removal and discovered Kalo.  It had really good reviews so I tried it and it works fantastic!  I have very few whiskers left, less and less all the time now, and my chin feels smooth with no ingrown hairs!  I still use my NoNo in the hopes that it is killing some whiskers too, but it is the Kalo cream that really helps.   I also thought I would try the Kalo on my legs and I even bought a depilator.  However, I just don't have the time/patience to do this (same for the NoNo on my legs) and it is so much easier and faster to shave.  I guess I just don't care enough about the hair on my legs.  And besides, I figure it will be so much more expensive if I'm using it on my legs too.  So to save money, I'm just saving the cream and spray for my face.  At first I was putting it on at least twice (sometimes three) times per day, and now it seems that just once a day in the morning is enough.  I also bought the Kalo ingrown hair treatment which works really well too, but I haven't had to use it for weeks now.  So I am really happy with the Kalo products and hopefully my experience can help someone else suffering from this really annoying and unsightly problem.   (I should mention that I also tried in the past the medical prescription product to inhibit facial hair growth, can't remember the name of it, and it did not work at all for me.  And at about $200 for one or two little tubes, it's ridiculously expensive.)  Update 06/16/15:  About a year ago, I couldn't take it anymore because I started breaking out with ingrowns again.  So I found another electrologist, she is very professional and much better than the previous one.  Yeah, it's expensive, I've spent $50 every two to three weeks for over a year now but my chin hairs have been completely eliminated!!!  We're still working on the upper lip hairs which were never as coarse as the chin hairs and don't cause ingrowns for me . . . but I want them GONE.  I'm thrilled with the results, just soft, smooth skin and no more repulsive blemishes; I consider it money well spent.  So the bottom line is that I still recommend Kalo, it does work, just not 100%.  If you want a permanent solution, electrolysis is the only way to go.  Anything else, including lasers, is a temporary fix.
B0007MW2ZW|5|I originally got this as a gift and only recently bought a replacement.  This smells good and is one of the best shaving creams I've ever used.  It's extremely luxurious and comes partially whipped.  If you've tried a variety of shaving creams and gels in different formats (aerosol, tub, bar, pump), you know that aerosolized gel tends to be the best for actual lubrication.  This product isn't aerosolized, nor is it gel, but it gives even better skin lubrication for shaving than any other product I've ever used.  It has a high silicone (or something) content in a luxurious semi-whipped &#34;pudding&#34;.  Using a shaving brush it doesn't require much on the end of the brush to be able to whip it into a slightly lighter froth and apply it thickly and evenly.  Shaving with it then provides a significantly better and irritation-free shave over any other product.  I've tried products claiming to be luxury shaving creams from other companies and I've been nothing but disappointed after using this one.<br /><br />There are a variety of scents available for this, though I've only ever used the sandalwood.  It's not an overpowering scent, and it's nicely masculine rather than the incense like smell I normally associate with sandalwood essential oils.  If you've ever tried any of the other sandalwood scented products from Taylor of Old Bond Street, it's consistent across their entire product line (shave lotion, shaving cream, pre-shave oil, and after shave gel).
B0009J8XSS|4|Good clippers. Strong motor. Wahl clipper attachment could use some heating to bend plastic ends to stay on better. Stays fairly cool, cuts through thick hair great
B00872H5II|5|Smells great and makes my face feel wonderful.
B003YSL9LE|5|I'll have to say that this is a must have on my list of beauty and skin supplies. Since it has so many tweezers it gives you a fast and less painful epilation. My legs are hair free and the hair stays pretty much gone for weeks. It holds a great charge so you can do both of your legs and maybe have some left over charge for another time or even a different area on your body. My only advice would be to get waxed first then use a epilator to keep the legs hair free. It's much easier that way.  I can say bye bye to waxing cost now since this little thing has replace that cost of beauty.
B008FP6KBU|5|These are very nice brushes.
B009043YXC|5|nice quality and just as described.
B0051QTM6Q|5|I love this but will never be able to afford it again.  If anyone can tell me what is close to it, please do!
B00KQC7X5M|3|It feels good.  Whether it works or not remains to be seen.
B00OLAQ1PI|5|Looks like it will last for a while.
B005AVMQCO|4|I waited like it was Christmas eve night on these to arrive, as my waves have been progressing very well. I knew that my Diane's could only take me so far without me having major brush sessions, which I really dont like brushing for 15-20 minutes at a time. Let me tell you after reading a lot of reviews about 'hype' and what not, but there is no hype, a noticeable difference after a quick session with this brush. Only down fall is the price, it doesn't need to be so expensive, the quality is unmatched and they don't use any more quality materials than other manufacturers. I think its just matter of standing out by the price. Like i say, product is five stars, price isn't.
B008Q8XN2K|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B00I0AHOW4|5|Loved it!!! Thank you so much!!!
B007NSS8CE|5|My daughter has been using this product for three years after using many other products.  It works and she doesn't want to change to anything else.
B00SGLZ23A|5|Got dry winter skin or scalp? Try this stuff! Excellent moisturizer without being too oily.
B001F51T3Q|5|BEST MOISTURIZER ever -- Have used for years (am 67 now) -- have fewer wrinkles than most people my age.<br /><br />I Just reordered (get the 6 oz 2 pack for the best price) and had to repeat myself again in a review.<br />I don't use expensive creams -- Aside from this the only product I also now use is the Vit C eye and facial creams from Avalon Organics -- but I never go without a morning and evening dose of this for an instant &#34;soft&#34; &#34;pink&#34; &#34;non-greasy&#34; feel to my skin.<br />Ahhhh and you can't beat the price compared to those expensive ones that do nothing more!
B00G1W8W9W|5|Love this - better than other vitamin C I have used in the past.
B00EOXEPRI|5|MUST TRY!
B00IRUN5OI|5|perfect :)
B0017WNSBS|5|This will get you all the ladies.
B000RL81AI|4|Kinda pricey. Good flavor. Grandkids like it, that's all that matters.
B000FQ5T2S|3|the glue might be old bc it didn't stick so i used other glue and then it was fine. nails are fine
B007307O54|5|color's nice perfect packing!<br />I loved it<br />also its limited edition, I was so lucky to have this lovely lipstick.
B000P24ERI|1|DO NOT BUY! Do not waste your money on this product. It does not work. I have been using it for 6 months and i do not see any positive result.
B001ET71TY|2|Very watered down, does not have good coverage at all.
B00J2APR98|4|I just started shaving regularly (daily, or every other day) and this razor was amazing for the first few shaves. Surprising, the flex ball did wonders for my annoying angular chin. However, with the price of just one of these razors, and how often one is 'recommended' to buy new ones, I would be broke very quickly. I only used the razor 5 times in about two weeks, and it's already causing burn after. But no cuts, and I believe its because of the flex ball.<br /><br />4 stars for the mobility of the razor, (since its the first time I haven't got cut on a razor on my chin after using it. (burn is a different story)) but the blades are the same old ones that are done in just a few uses. However, I am buying definitely buying it again.
B0043L1C18|4|It's fresh and soft. Nice to put ecological and natural product on my face. I like the products of this company: transparancy, and all is etiqueted. So you know all the ingredients which composed the products and what you put on your skin.<br />Good shipping and packaging.
B001OOLF82|5|Does the job on all sensitive teeth.
B00176GW5I|5|It is quite strong, you only need one pad to clean your all you nails before applying polish. I also use the same pad to remove sticky top coat (gel polish) after completely cured with LED/UV lamp. So this pack of 200 wipes will last me 200 manicures - each gel nail manicure lasts 2 weeks, so I think I need a new pack in ~ 7 yrs.<br /><br />***Please note that these wipes are not made to remove old polish, you still want to use cotton balls to remove old polish.
B00OZYBLPA|5|Awesome
B002CLL85Q|5|This is a very outstanding razor, it is very well made and works just great, I get just as good a shave with it as I do with my original Gillettes.
B000NQ6PJ6|5|Amazing!!
B001E768U4|5|Tried all the others like toms, arm and hammer, and salt crystal ones... This is the only one that works! It does not stop perspiration but it keeps the B.O. away. It has a very faint pleasant smell. My boyfriend uses the other scent since its more masculine. Purchasing again for the 3rd time!
B006FKXWCW|5|These are EXACTLY what I was wanting when I ordered them! The shipped fast, were well packed and function as expected! I love them!
B00DRFGKCM|5|Excellent product, covers gray very well. My hair is dark brown, but new growth comes in completely gray/white. Application is very easy, and it does not look like you &#34;painted&#34; it on. I ordered  it in the color &#34;Blonde&#34; even though my hair is dark brown. The product actually looks like it is more for medium to dark brown hair. My hair also has a bit of red in it, and it blends very very well!! I have been buying this product for over a year, and I will continue to do so. My hair grows extremely fast, and with having it a dark color, there is noticeable growth within two weeks. This product helps me stretch out my visits, for touch ups and coloring.
B003G05K6K|5|I love it!
B001ECQ7G4|5|I have been using Tend Skin for several years especially in the summer months were I am shaving daily and exposing my underarms.  I usually could only find this product online and with the product cost and shipping it almost came to double what I would pay if found in the stores.  This is such a great cure for the irritation that happens with ingrown hairs.  I use this on my bikini area and underarms at least 2 times daily when I first begin treatment and then down to once a day for maintainence.  There is a slight stinging if you use directly after shaving, but I hardly notice now.  I've noticed when using Tend Skin on the underarms, you can forego deodorant (don't worry).  Yes I hardly ever wear deodorant when I use the Tend Skin immediately after application and  NO I do not smell.  This is a great product and the prices are comparable.
B001BSIZS4|5|I love it!
B0049LUI9O|2|The product worked absolutely great until it stopped 2 months after purchase. I tried different sets of batteries but it refuses to turn on. But during the time it did work, I really liked it. Its got great battery life and gets rid of hair without any pull or pluck feeling. Guess its time to move to a Wahl product.
B00006ANDQ|4|Although I'm happy with my purchase of these Oral replacements, I have to admit they do leave me feeling raw in my area when used for more than 5 minutes.  While they're no match for the original, they still get the JOB done.
B009UYZCEG|5|I took a chance on this. I usually wear Sally Hansen, but the yellow I bought before(Sally or someone else, I can't remember) chipped and peeled immediately. This color is a rich, pearlescent yellow that covers well. In most light, it looks more golden than yellow; I get a lot of complements on it and people always describe it as &#34;gold&#34; rather than yellow. It's an especially nice summer shade, and looks best on my hands when I get a little tan. I expect ladies with a darker skin tone than mine would enjoy it year round.
B000195RSA|5|I have fallen hard for Royal Secret II. Thankfully RSII is nothing like the original. It opens with citrus but develops into a lovely, powdery scent that is that is not dominated by a floral heart or a woody base.
B004FOTOO0|1|This wasn't for me.. Way too strong and not appealing or sexy!! It may be for you tho.. That's why I always try small bottles! I do love paris hilton just me tho!! This bottle is pretty.. But a no!
B00E4PMQAO|5|The product itself is very impressive, as others have stated it feels like a quality product in your hand and it trims quickly and cleanly without pulling or yanking any hairs. But perhaps best of all those few who have reported encountering any issues with the product have received immediate attention and resolution to their issue. It is a great relief to know there still are companies like this one that put out quality products and stand behind them.
B00JRCFKR0|5|all I can say is that i wish the jar was bigger! however, a little goes a long way. Skin feels softer right away. I will be buying this product again as it is so far the only cream with pure hyaluronic acid in it, and of course because I love it.
B00HVKAYL2|5|Nice light shampoo!!
B00OYVZ6UA|5|Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel, will be purchasing more when mine runs out :)
B004DKAYUE|5|Listen, my hair has been one of the miseries of my life.  Frizzy, curly/wavy -- an absolute mess.  Of course I use a flat iron and in winter it usually looks ok.  But summer in New Orleans (which basically is April - October) is like living in a great big steam room.  I can do my hair and if 10 seconds of humidity hit my hair it's over.  I am not being dramatic, trust me.  So, I was considering getting the keratin straightening treatments at the salon.  It seems like it would be the answer to my prayers but I was nervous.  Would my hair be so straight and flat that it would be greasy looking? So I started doing some research and came across a post about this Frizz Ease 3 Day Straightner.  I came to Amazon to read the reviews ( I love love love Amazon by the way) and most were great.  I decided I would try it -- I have a big party planned for tomorrow night so I ran to Walmart tonight to get it.  Washed and sprayed this product in and followed the simple instructions-- blow dry straight then flat iron.  Oh my God!  My hair is STRAIGHT.  It supposed to last 3 days but I wash my hair everyday -- usually because it looks like Medusa after being out running around.  We'll see -- maybe I can skip a day.  The next test is how it does in the real world of New Orleans - 98 degrees and 90% humidity.  I'll post an update and let everyone know.
B001MA0QY2|5|I really like using this hair straightener. It feels very smooth as it glides over my hair, and the results, even by a rather novice hair styler, are great. The design of the straightener is very nice, it is easy to hold and move about.<br /><br />I also like the adjustable temperature control. I use it at a middle of the range temperature for my hair and it holds the heat very well.<br /><br />Overall, I would totally recommend it, I have fine, fly-away hair and it makes it look so much better.
B001RMJHVI|5|My daughter broke out in a rash at the age of 6 months and ever since has had what doctors have diagnosed as \\"eczema\\". I started using this product and she only has one or two very tiny patches left on her skin and her skin is SO soft! I started using it too and I love it! A little heavy for summer weather but I use it in the winter when it gets so dry out.
B00APV7OWG|4|so I would give it t a 5 star as I love this hairdryer but.. it just broke :((  I  never thought a particular type of hair dryer could made a difference but I invested in this anyway. I love love love it. I used to get blow outs but I havent recently because this dryer makes a huge difference in my hair texture. I have now convinced my 2 friends and my sister to purchase one too.  the only reason I did not give it a 5 is that I purchased 4 months ago and it is already broken.. the &#34;cool shot&#34; button is depressed permanently so it only dries using cold air. Im hopeful that this is a just an anomaly  and that the company will send me a new one.... but we will see. PS... I never use the &#34;cool shot&#34;, I just depressed the button by mistake when I picked up the dryer and now it wont un-press :((
B00WNX9A1C|5|This made my face feel so clean after using! I have problems with Acne and I saw a huge decrease in occurrence after using. My skin feels wonderful!:-)
B007B93TR4|5|Great product and seller, no problem.
B002BWOXYE|5|Arrived quickly and happy to get a replacement for a terrific discontinued product.  It makes the skin luminous, smooth and works to lighten those dark spots.
B000V3Q2CG|4|I used an original one before, and this is first time to use this model.<br />I don't think that it has a differnce but<br />I still like it.. It is not strong and never result any skin problems.<br />But good texture, and make my skin moistured!
B00E0TTZ4O|5|I love it and was very sad when the fragrance was dropped by Bath and Body Works! so glad to find it on Amazon!!
B00A4DKSU0|5|It was a gift and she loved it.  Very happy!
B004J31KOO|5|I love this pencil.  It's long lasting, goes on easily and completes my daily makeup routine with a nice finish.  Highly recommend.
B0000YV83O|5|Great product using for years
B001ET7M16|5|I first found Bikini Zone at Walmart but haven't been able to find it since... they are always sold out... I know why now... this stuff works!  I tried some other product I found at Sally's but it just didn't work for me...  I don't have to use a lot of the Bikini Zone product either...  I'm so glad its available here!
B0009WMIW2|4|Received this as a gift. Nice compact size for traveling. Mine was monogramed and it turned out nice.
B009GLQ57G|5|I use this as an eyeliner when I wear burgundy shadow.  It is a true burgundy and makes my hazel eyes really stand out.  It's soft enough so that it doesn't tug unnecessarily at the delicate the eye area and although my eyes tear up sometimes, it doesn't run.  I'm surprised that it works so well because it was so inexpensive.  I guess this goes to show that you can get good products for less money sometimes.  I use the eyeliner along the lashline and then go over it with burgundy shadow.  The line stays put and makes a dramatic impact when I do a subtle cat's eye. I like the fact that it's a retractable pencil and so doesn't need sharpening, which wastes valuable product.  This liner would also work well for those with green or brown eyes.  I haven't used it as a lipliner since I don't wear dark lipstick (and this pencil is a true dark burgundy) but presumably it would work for that purpose too. The color shown in the add is very close to the actual color of the pencil. It has a red undertone and is mixed in equal parts with purple.  A pretty color. It is a nice alternative to black or brown.  I definitely recommend this product.
B004ARTZJQ|5|For a non toxic nail polish I am impressed by the lasting power of this compared to others like the pig paint. That stuff would not even last the day!
B00CFBK5L6|1|Worked great for my car until one of the bulbs came unglued from the base. Junk. Don't buy
B00S307EUI|5|The color is so natural and looks great.
B00T6IHQCC|5|I love this product. I recently purchased the regular biore strip with no charcoal and I feel like the charcoal absorbed more than the original. My skin is always clean and smooth where I removed the strip. It feels good to the touch. There is often some black residue left on the skin afterwords, but it rinses off easily with water. What I can say is to make sure you wait until the strip has hardened on your face. If you take it off too soon, it will definitely cause discomfort.<br />If you are someone who deals with congested skin in the t-zone area, this is a wonderful solution. I will be going back to the charcoal once my new strip are used up.
B00084YBWQ|4|I really like this product except for one thing: it turns my face hot pink! No itching, no burning, great moisturizing, but again hot pink!
B0000YUW54|5|My first one lasted many years. Works GREAT!
B00LN5EZ5W|4|Very pretty, but doesn't come with anything to tie it on with, but can use some ribbon I have.
B00C1W2PW6|5|I finally found this again! Although the main ingredient changed and the percentage is less than the original (3%), the end result is still the same - clearer skin!!!  I
B006IB5T4W|5|Husband loves it for chapped skin.
B00NY5NGPE|4|I have recvd compliments from coworkers that my skin appears glowing, which is great.
B0029OIWNC|4|grandson loves it
B0026VFK9W|3|Love the concept of liquid eyeliner - but getting it applied is a tough task for me.  Perhaps this is all about user error - I am certainly working on my skills.  It is black - so it's supposed to be dark - but it still shocked me.  I did experience eye irritation, however I have VERY sensitive eyes and the irritation came after a few days of use.  I now just use this periodically.
B00SLX059O|5|Great little kit, I love the daily microfoliant! Great deal in this little package and it lasts me a long time.
B00MAPRUSI|1|The all purpose reclining, don't recline. It  was  really hard to put together and  there was missing pieces. I had to purchase the missing piece of myself.
B003U8ESI4|5|ok....i spent a lot of time researching a beard trimmer and based on Amazon reviews chose this one.  This is just a hair trimmer and renamed a beard trimmer.  No difference except for a cheap plastic adjustable cutting guard.  I screwed up cutting my beard the first time with this.  So now I have the woman that cuts my hair trim my beard.  She does a better job and doesn't charge much.  btw....she used a $300.00 3 inch trimmer to work on my beard.  You can't go wrong buying this trimmer.  It doesn't cost that much.  I still use it to do minor trimming.  Nice to have it around if i need it....
B0042I37II|5|It works great!  my clients love it, they say that it drys their hair very fast and it can be used anywhere.
B000FIZB0G|5|OK, I've tried many brands of face wash with a lot of experimenting.  A went through a lot of stuff at Target and Walmart but couldn't find anything that I liked.  Then I realized that Asian markets have different ones and found those to be better, the best being this product by FAR.  Very soft, lathers up well, needs only a very small amount so it'll last a long time, leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  This is by far the best one.  No need to look further!
B004JIZ3XS|5|I am not sure what all these parts are for, but the ones that I do use work very well. Be careful I have one flat head that has a rough edge on it, but it is only on one side. I just use the other side.
B00EYUZLIS|5|Love this product!
B000CEQZZS|4|After reading many of the reviews, I decided to give this a shot.  I like it.  It may not be for everyone, but I think it smells pleasant.  My wife said I smelled like Christmas.  She also liked it.  Again, it's different from your average cheap cologne, Brut, Old Spice, etc.  But it's nice.  I wish my local drugstore carried more Pinaud products.  Some of them are good.  For the record, I also like the Clubman Vanilla which I saw wasn't popular with some folks.  I only wished the scent lasted a bit longer.
B0006Q00ZI|4|This is an effective cream for soft brittle nails that I have used before.  Product is what I expected; it arrived on time so thankfully no difficulties with this purchase.
B00GGXFJ7O|5|I love this product, my skin looks and feels different...the sponge works well also to apply my night cream. very practical
B007FIUE74|5|I purchased this set of brushes as a gift for a friend who is getting into makeup. The brushes arrived on time and from what I've been told by the friend that I bought them for they work great and are very easy to clean. They have a short handle which she says is ideal because you feel like you are getting in and using your fingers since you are not worrying about a long handle that could get in the way.
B00J2D80W6|5|Retinol helps to prevent fine lines, wrinkles and firms the skin. I only use this cream at night.  I feel my skin very hydrated.<br />I highly recommend to use it if you have oily skin and acne because retinol helps to prevent breakouts.  You must use sunscreen.<br />@MakeupByOne
B006J5YB2I|5|I have allergic, sensitive skin which is also prone to acne.  I have no problems with Smashbox BB Cream or their Light Primer.  In fact, I've stopped buying foundation b/o I get light non occlusive coverage with this combination.
B000X9L9EE|2|I've used this product for several weeks now.  It seems to help the GERD significantly.  However my blood pressure has skyrocketed about 30 points systolic.  i guess I'll stop and see if it returns to its previous level.  I thought the \\"D\\" in DGL was supposed to compensate for that.  So be careful.
B001KNNCL0|5|This product does a great job at building waves and keeping your hair moist. I would buy this product again
B000Y038CS|5|I've been using this product every day for probably 3 years now. I used to get occasional break outs on my shoulders and this body wash cleared them up and keeps my skin clear. I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate me at all. It has a light and pleasant scent.
B0036FTF16|3|This is watered-  down. For the price- its OK- its more like a 'body splash'. If you love the strength of the original (like myself) this is NOT for you. its like - the lotion you would get with a fragrance- good but noticeably milder. I like it enough- but will buy it in the department store next time.. I paid about a 3rd of what the store charges.. you get what you pay for... Because it was an Amazon purchase- I thought I'd get the real thing... NOPE.. it does smell nice- BUT WEAK
B00AFWPVUC|5|I love these toothbrushes!!! They deep clean so well it feels like a flossed. They never smell or taste funny!
B00RFM5984|4|Awesome brushes. Affordable.
B002VH64KA|5|I have been using this for a while now. I found it on Amazon for about half of what my local Spa sells it.
B00433NEEE|1|I received the wrong product, so I really can't leave an accurate review on this.  The product I received was 3 eyebrow pencils in a brown color.
B0016C0SYO|5|good
B00112DUBW|5|Just like the name, it is always a perfect point for this product. It is difficult to find a color that works well for for brown hair in the later stages of turning grey, but this is the exception.
B009I4PRI4|5|I have always loved Rosebud Salve. I remember my mother using this when I was young. Excellent for many uses.
B003NTJJR0|5|I love this moisturizer. My skin is very sensitive, acne-prone, and reacts to a lot of stuff. It's also oily and I find myself looking shiny throughout the day. This stuff has helped this problem a lot.<br /><br />I also don't feel like I'm putting on a heavy, greasy moisturizer. It is sticky at first, but it quickly absorbs into the skin. Another plus is it makes my skin tone look more even. I had a dermatologist once think I had rosacea due to my skin's constant redness. This moisturizer definitely helps relieve some of that redness. It's a bit pricy, but it's a price I'm willing to pay for the awesome results!
B00IAMTLS2|5|Seems to work well on my teenage son's acne that he's been fighting with for years.  We tried this after having only monderate success with the other name brand products.
B0028476N0|1|Purchased mine on HSN.com on 5/13/11. The product died on 4/18/12. I did find it somewhat helpful on occasion, but can't possibly give it more than 1 star considering the product died after 11 months. The product supposedly comes with a 1 year warranty. Contacted the manufacturer, will see what happens. This should not happen to a product that costs ~$200.<br /><br />5/21/12 update: As expected, dealing with horrible customer service. It's been over 4 weeks since I contacted them and the soap opera goes on. They took too long to send me a replacement. When I finally received a replacement, it turned out to be the wrong product. They sent me a No!No! Hair instead of Skin. When I called to report the error, they blamed everything on me saying I sent them a proof of purchase for No!No! Hair instead of Skin. I don't even own a No!No! Hair and never bought one so how I could've sent them a proof of purchase for that I don't know. I'm sitting here staring at a fax I sent them with a proof of purchase and it clearly says No!No! Skin. Filed a complaint with BBB.
B000FVZBEY|3|This product was OK, but its too small to be called large.  Sorry.  Marsha    PS And a little too much cost.
B001AMMSIY|5|I love this product -- from how it smells to how it makes my hair feel to how it makes my hair look. an excellent choice in products.
B001UE7D2I|5|It does the job for me.  A bit heavy but otherwise is just what I wanted.  I would buy again.
B00HV934VK|1|I am disappointed. I am an extremely detailed person and pay close attention to items that I purchase off of Amazon. I do not at all recall purchasing a MINI TRAVEL SIZE. I purchased a 1.7 OZ bottle. I would never pay 24.99 for a .17 OZ bottle of perfume. SUPER DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000GJL3H4|5|An incredible healing product! If I get dehydrated or spend a bit too much time out of doors, my lips crack hideously. Lip calm heals my lips quickly. A bit every night at bedtime prevents the painful cuts as well. This cost more than the 99 cent chapstick, but is so very much worth it. I've tried everything, and this is truly the best! Light pleasant citrus smell. In a pinch, I've even used a dab on cracked feet and hands and I was surprised how much it helped.
B0058SY1XQ|1|For nearly double the price of an average facial trimmer these days, I suggest investing elsewhere. The main issue I have found with this trimmer is that it does not posses the necessary power to trim a thick beard such a mine, even in its very beginning stages. With a full charge, it still gets caught in my short facial hair as I slowly pass through it. I highly recommend looking for another trimmer!
B004JKRISE|5|I picked this cold cream up, on a whim, at my local dollar store. It removes makeup thoroughly and rinses off well. A quick once over with a warm wash cloth, and my skin is left soft and clean, never tight or greasy. At a fraction of the price of other cold creams, April Cold Cream is definately a smart buy.
B007PHS13O|4|Very light, absorbs quickly!
B008QMWM5U|5|Son with dry skin found this simple soap helps his condition. Smaller size bars at a decent price.  Will buy again.
B00I134Y82|5|Makes my hair feel great and I use it as face moisturizer occassionally and it works well for that purpose as well. The chapstick they sent with it was also great! Would definately recommend this product.
B00EA5AC5E|4|This is a good polish. I didn't get a full week rather it lasted 5-6 days. Definitely better than regular nail polish
B00M7SQ6LK|5|Love it. I will be shopping with you again!
B00EXUH6RI|5|MY MOMS FAVORITE,HARD TO FIND
B00MS41GJ0|5|Having a really good quality eye lash curler is very important to me because If you guys dont know, a lot of cheap curlers can easily snap and break. You dont want that metal poking in your face and damage your eyeballs!!!!!! Cheap or bad quality curlers can also cut your eyelashes hair!<br /><br />Upon receiving this product, I inspected the way it's made first before trying it on my eyelashes. The curler does not have a spring like some curlers do. It open and closes very smoothly. Personally I like that it has a little bit of resistance because I can control the &#34;curling/pinching&#34; part. The handle is very unique too! If you are confused why its designed that way, I tell you what, my fingers has never been relaxed while curling my eyelashes. My thumb, point and middle finger sits on that handle perfectly it almost like it's molded specially for me.<br /><br />So I tested it on the tip of my hair first before trying it on my eyelashes, just to make sure that it doesn't cut. Passed that test and I am loving it already. I curled it for about good 10 seconds and it really curled the hair.<br /><br />Finally I tested it on my eyelashes and the result is really good! It curls like it's supposed to, it curls most of my lashes from end to end, and it doesn't snag any hair out so that's very important. It's amazing what a good quality curler (also a good mascara) can do to make your eyes look bigger and brighter.<br /><br />So far I am loving this new curler. Very comfortable to use, great resistance, glides smottly, no cutting eyelashes hair and its made well. Oh it also comes with a little clip that keeps your curler closed when unused. That's really neat as long as you dont lose it.<br /><br />Other thing that would have been great is for it to come with extra rubber pads. You know them pads are gonna get dirty from the mascara!  But other than that, this is a great product and I highly recommend it. I posted some photos, hope they are helpful to you.<br /><br />***i got this product at a discounted price in return of my honest and unbiased review. I love the curler so it deserves a 5 star. If it breaks or something, i'll definitely update but so far it's really nice!***>***i got this product at a discounted price in return of my honest and unbiased review.

B006GTKSHY|5|Its perfect for my sister
B009HULDYG|5|Easy to use, nice . It creates very nice curlers. Better than all the rollers i had before. Go for it.
B0002260L4|5|I put this into my tub and it disolved into my own private lagoon. I absolutely love the smell of the ocean and the seaweed is an extra nice touch.  I wish I could afford to use one of these every night!
B0013NBVYM|5|Work great! Just glad they were in stock. The package arrived quickly! Heard this product was discontinued. Grateful I was able to get so many packs sf once.
B001G59MHK|5|I love this product as my hair is thin. Its not sticky and it thickens and even curls my hair slightly. WIll buy again.
B00JX0OYNM|1|It smells like shoe cream. Does not feel good on skin either. Horrible.
B00AMOLEMW|5|This lipstick is so  beautiful that you can't not believe until you see it yourself.Is so creamy and taste so good.
B00AJEOSJ6|3|This wig was okay at best. The wig is so much darker than the picture, 3-5 shades, and the wig is not anywhere close to the fullness depicted. The wig does however, have the redeeming qualities of beautiful curls, but also has frizz. The cap is very nice as well.
B001EOFBLE|5|If you have oily hair, just hop in the shower and put on a dab or 5 of Pert!  Rub it in pretty good and then rinse a while. ALL the oil is gone and your hair feels great!  This is like a wonder product.  You won't be spending too much money because an application to remove oil works for like a month and you don't need to use much at all.  I don't know how other shampoos are, but one of the first I tried was Pert and there was NO REASON whatsoever to go to anything else!
B00D58KUAO|3|Not sure why i keep going back to this shampoo.  It's just ok.  Sometimes my hair doesn't feel completely clean after it and there are so many different color bottles labeled for specific hair types, but when I tried a bunch, they all seem to give the same results.  High-end salons love it.  I've since bought Redken, which is cheaper and makes my scalp feel cleaner
B00G99SSGO|5|them are perfect !!!!! i received them 1-2 weeks earlier :D im more than happy for this item !!
B005BKQCH4|5|I love this product and this is the best price I have ever seen it.
B001BHOQRO|5|This. Is a great product when everything on the market doesn't work for you. Learned about it from a nail tech and she used it on me until I begged her to tell me what it was
B008AZ4INW|1|Not at all! I have used the product for over 20 years, the product that I always get is an oil that spreads very easily over your face, few drops are enough for the whole face. With this serum you have to apply a big amount to cover the whole face; I personally was not happy with the product I received, maybe it was my mistake for not realizing it was serum. I won't order it anymore.
B00P2UCZ6A|2|The hair piece quality is great, but the color is way off. The picture color show is much darker then item I received. Very disappointed.
B005HTM7SM|5|Nearly 40 and still wearing Love's Baby Soft.  Love it- and I didnt realize when I ordered this that it was a smaller bottle- I think I overpaid a bit- but the scent is very strong so maybe I won't have to reapply it as often.
B00P7CCAVS|5|During the summer I go bare faced [well, without foundation!] and I love the way this blends into my skin to give it a lil' something extra while I have some sun.  The colours blend beautifully together.
B008O4YM7G|4|Appears to be well  made.  Bristles are firm, yet flexible.  If it holds its bristles after months of use I would then rate it as 5 stars.
B00AOFXU0S|3|Was disappointed that it didn't have the pleasant smell my original tube had.
B003HG4VLS|5|I am addicted to this eyeliner!  My daughter gave it to me as part of a birthday present and I’ve been reordering it ever since.  It's perfect!  Easy to apply and stays on all day.  I will never use any other eyeliner.
B004R7L6WI|4|The Product is great, but the SIZE is not described accurately.  This sample size should not be sold as a travel size.  Amazon should discontinue allowing this vendor to advertise this product as travel size.  I'm okay with the amount I received because I wanted to sample the product before I purchased the larger unit.  But the packaging clearly states 'NOT FOR RESALE'.  This wholesaler should not be allowed to misrepresent bare minerals - they have wonderful products.
B0083VLUWK|3|this cream seems to leave my skin a little oily<br />has not helped with wrinkles, however container was very small and may take longer<br />have not used enough yet to give recommendations to friends
B002DPUY5Q|3|burned my skin a little and didn't really make a difference in the black circles.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|Great!
B004UQ6NP6|1|Had to use multiple times & still did NOT get a clean shave or cut all facial hair!!! Not to mention my neck break out, due to having going over it over and over again... Tried to use it twice doing everything I could, but it just did \\"NOT CUT IT\\"!
B00IJGRJQA|5|Great product!!
B000BTO6E6|5|I have been using Kouros since 1984, and always liked the aroma, and when I was dating, all the women absolutely loved it. Even men would ask me the name of it and where to get it. I always get compliments, and you use it sparingly so it lasts a long time. For me it has always lasted me at least a year.
B000FYVOJC|5|Great Condition
B001VH6F9G|1|I have a 7680 which I love, and this seemed great in the past.  For some reason, this time was different.  I have been using this for a couple months now and I feel as if I'm taking longer to shave, and it doesn't really appear that I have shaved. Although my face feels pretty smooth, it just doesn't look shaven.  If anyone is reviewing reviews, please let me know if I should be using a different replacement.  Thanks.
B000USAJ9O|5|Excellent for sunburn too!
B00GWBSRE2|3|It's not as cute as in the advertizement but it gets the job done.  I thought that I was getting a good deal because the really cute ones at the store sell for $5.99 and up but this does not look cute.  It is a good material band but the design is like something a 5 year old would make.  No offense.
B00JUDJZI6|5|Pretty wonderful sleep masks. They aren't as crinkly as I'd anticipated (due to their price), and having two straps keeps them in place all night.
B004YH8CR8|3|Purchased the product for my lady. Items arrived on time and packaged very well. Everything that was described was in the package but here are the issues. It was supposed to come with 6 different scented nail polish removers There was 6 but 2 diferent scents lemon and grape. The image that they posted shows 6 different scents, so that was a let down. The second issue is that my lady has recently said that the nail polish comes off too easily and quickly. I don't use nail polish so I'm going by what she told me. She was very happy to get the gift but we'll see the more she uses it.
B00D13H8B2|5|I was introduced to this product at a salon a year ago but the owner no longer carried it.Perfect color for me and lasts longer than previous brand.
B003DKO83E|5|Yes this pulls your hair but not anymore than normal ones do! It's the only ponytail that holds my curly thick hair up all day!
B00L3LB0IG|5|Noticeable softer skin after only a few days!  Love the fact that it is unscented as sometimes scents will trigger my asthma, but this didn't affect me at all. I applied it every morning after cleansing and toning.  Very lightweight and easy to apply. Will definitely continue to use this. Highly recommend.
B003JCLPI2|5|Awesome product!!
B001EJIMRO|5|Great product.  Because of its size makes it easier to get into sensitive areas without nicks.  Definitely would purchase again.
B0054HCSMM|4|This is the closest, smoothest, zero irritation shave I've ever had and from completely natural ingredients.  But, the buzz kill is that this is identical to Noxzema in smell and face-freeze.  There is no reason for the menthol overkill in this product.  It's actually annoying to feel on your face and smell.  They could remove that and really have a 5 out of 5 star product, because the shave is superior.
B005GNL5G4|5|thank!!!
B006OHM0JM|1|Can't say anything positive about this product. I found it to be very stiff, sticky and created buildup on my hair. Would not purchase again.
B00846HDH0|5|It's a great item and it's a great price for the ounces received... Couldn't ask for a better price... Beyond happy!!!
B00005REAV|2|This product is pretty awful.  It is soft and smells okay but after awhile it has a slight pulling/drying effect and when you put on your moisturizer you have to almost immediately go back and drench more moisturizer on a couple of times.  Eventually you feel okay but it is not for dry skin and I asked for a product but it wanot exact.  You see, it says Lavender FAcial Cleansing Milk but there are at least two types of that!  I ended up with the wrong damn one.  I got Luminosity.  That is not what I want.
B00F267UNC|4|The only thing I was disappointed about this atomizer was the lack of &#34;pump&#34; at the bottom (like the Travolo). For it's price, it's worked very well for me, and I use it to carry and re-spray perfume when traveling.
B001G0JNL0|5|My main criteria for an everyday moisturizer is:<br /><br />1. non-greasy<br />2. has SPF<br />3. low toxicity according to the Safe Cosmetics Database<br />4. affordable<br /><br />This product hits all of what I'm looking for.<br /><br />1. I have normal to oily skin. This product did not make my face feel greasy or oily after I blended it in (as other moisturizer+spf products I've used in the past). My face had a nice dewy feeling after putting on this moisturizer, and I was able to apply concealer and powder foundation over this product without any problems. After a week of use my face didn't break out, or show any adverse reactions.<br /><br />2. Zinc oxides are a great type of sunscreen, but unfortunately most of the products I've ever used with zinc oxide is EXTREMELY difficult to completely rub into the skin. This was pleasantly not an issue for me, the moisturizer is white, but spreads easily and disappears into the skin so I don't look like a ghost after applying this product.<br /><br />3. It's a futile attempt to try to have no exposure to any toxins with everything we come across in our life. But for a daily product, I really wanted something that had a low toxicity rating on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, and this one was one of the lowest for moistruizer+spf that's still within my budget.<br /><br />4. There are some steep discounts right now, and totally worth it.<br /><br />This is the first review I've done for any type of cosmetics, but I just feel compelled to share this find. Hope others will also find it to be amazing as I have.
B0028K3J9O|5|I love this eye roller. It's soothing, moisturizing and  aids in minimizing fine lines. I would recommend this product to a friend.
B000NHXVOM|2|The seal on the cap was opened and much of the product leaked out during shipping.  Would not buy from seller again.  The scent is strong and smells just like rosemary.  When used with the burner, it creates a nice scent throughout the home.  It burns quickly and product is a bit expensive to keep having to refill burner.
B0032ANCUU|5|NO ODOR.  Just like you buy in the store.  Great price!
B0074MAPOI|4|Nice product, I like the spray  so I can spritz my face.  Smells good too!  Easy on sensitive skin. I will purchase again.
B00J6L7HAA|4|Very Satisfied with this product. Would give it five stars but I haven't had it long enough.
B001L1H8DY|4|I really like this product.  It has adds a very subtle brightness around my eyes without ever caking and make me look more awake and energized.  I don't notice that it does any lifting at all, just brightening.  I just swoosh it on and tap it a little with my ring finger to spread it out; it doesn't require careful blending as it's quite sheer.  The only downside is that there's not much in the tube and pretty soon I'm trying to scrape the applicator against the tube lining to get the last bits.  I've also used the Benefit Eye Bright Pencil, which I don't care for as much --  it's more obvious and requires more careful application.<br /><br />My skin tone is fair with pink undertones.  I don't think you could go wrong with Ooh La Lift if you're a similar skin type.
B003W93QIO|1|This has not once worked for me, even when using it while the dye is still wet and setting on my hair.
B003UKM9CO|5|It works as expected.
B000UPT8RG|5|This is cheaper than Ulta.  I recommend buying this product online versus in the dept stores - it shoudl be changed out every few months so it can get expensive.
B009HULKLW|5|OMG!! You don't need to purchase expensive curlformers...These work just as well and are soooooo much cheaper!!!! Thanks so much!!
B007DN75ZA|4|This is an attractive, well-made razor that delivers a close, comfortable shave. The extra girth and weight take some getting used to, but to me the weight helps me keep a light, even touch. The $35 Merkur might actually be a better value, but the Muhle is nice if you can justify the extra few bucks.<br /><br />My original order was severely damaged in transit due to improper packaging and gross mistreatment by USPS, but the vendor replaced it right away (with much better packaging) at no cost or hassle to me. One very minor thing -- it would be good PR to include a blade with a new razor. Just sayin'.
B00LN5EZ5W|2|Received too late. Oh well, still pretty
B0012J30LY|5|I have used this cream for 2 years now...i guess i have the fragrant free because it has no smell...and i use it before make up..as moisturizer..and it works real good!
B00IB5JAJS|4|They look more grayish in the picture in reality they are to brown for me since I'm a blonde but it's very nice to work with it!<br />I like it
B00WW0AI3K|2|Smaller than expected . It also is very sticky when applied.
B00DJ6Y0V2|5|Really does block humidity.
B00021CQHC|5|i love this portable perfume...it's really sleek and easy to carry around to reapply. the smell is delicious and it leaves a nice shimmery sheen on your skin.
B0039B3KNQ|5|I have searched high and low for quality tinted moisturizers or BB creams that contain decent ingredients and have 30+ SPF.  This product met my needs and I actually found it on sale at CVS for an awesome price.  The coverage on this is thicker than most tinted moisturizers and remind me of BB creams, but without the \\"gray\\".  I never had any flashing issues in images - this is HUGE.  For those who have said it's oily - yes, it's true.  However, as with any tinted moisturizers, foundations, or BB creams, you must set with some high definition powder.  I buy the ELF kind since it's only $6 and it makes all the difference in the world.  I wouldn't wear it straight because you will end up looking like an oil slick :)
B000GLRREU|4|The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works well in removing food caught in ones teeth. It though, is not a substitute for flossing. My recommendation is to first use the Waterpik, then proceed to floss, which removes the white plaque the Waterpik doesn't do. I have many years using this unit. The only problem I have had, is to replace the hose a few times, as it split. The plastic used on the hose, is a bit too rigid. A more flexible type of plastic / rubber should be used instead. I do recommend it.
B00D5Y03EQ|5|I Love it. you just need a few drops for wherever you need to use it. Amazing quality. Yes I recommend it.
B000KG87WW|5|As a fairly hairy woman, these two little trimmers are GREAT. And the price is unbeatable. I use the standard trimmer for around bikini area and the round trimmer is great as well for those pesky nose hairs. They both have multiple uses. I've used both a handful of times and I'm still on my first set of batteries.
B001E763NQ|5|Smells unbelievably good. Leaves my skin feeling smooth. Expensive for a bar of soap.
B0002F1XF4|5|I would recommend this along with any Shiseido item.  I use this daily and my skin is unbelievably soft.  I've tried so many items before Shiseido and nothing compares.  I would recommend this to anyone of any age.
B0015YFTTC|5|Lots of power and easy to use.  Fit well near my vanity mirror.  Very pleased.
B000WYZ9Q4|5|My wife says this is the absolute best mascara she's ever used.  She has had me buy this multiple times and is the only mascara she will use.  It doesnt clump and it makes her eyelashes look amazing
B00GOBPD10|5|Excellent shaver.
B00KY5LET2|1|You can't see them on nails and they come right off
B00LPC0HCS|1|They sent me body wash when I bought lotion.
B00DYZ7ZCO|4|Swivel head is less active. The clipper seems to work better. The whole unit is heavy and clunsey compaired the the previous model. Given the oppurtunity I would buy the old modle.
B001KYO8JO|1|This product should NEVER be used as a flat iron spray. It makes your hair sticky, stiff, hard and crunchy. It'll cause major breakage if you comb your hair after applying this spray. If anything, it could be used as a spritz to hold a style in place. But overall this product is a complete waste of money.
B007ZXR4I6|5|I was so excited when I received my onei flat iron! Its super light which helps when you are ironing long hair. It heats up really quickly which is always a plus in the morning before going to work. I've been using flat irons for a very long time and I've used all the famous brands and honestly onei is the best one I have used so far. Can't wait to try their other products!
B003XDVER4|5|If you don't have gingivitis, or other gum related problems, I don't see a reason to purchase this toothpaste.  I'm not sure why so many people are knocking this for tasting bad, causing mucus-like film buildup, or other unpleasant side-effects while also stating they have a healthy mouth! This is strong stuff and shouldn't be used for individuals that have normal to good teeth & gums.  Sure, Crest hasn't done a great job informing the consumer that it's not really for the average user, but the \\"Clinical\\" label should be at least be a warning.<br /><br />This should be viewed like prescription grade dandruff shampoo.  You wouldn't use strong dandruff shampoo if you have a healthy scalp/hair (it turns your hair to straw), so why use this if you have healthy gums & teeth?<br /><br />Regarding my experience with the toothpaste, I've never had a cavity or any serious issues concerning my gums, but laziness in my brushing over the last few years has caused two of my teeth to constantly bleed while I brush with my electric toothbrush.  I attributed this to plaque buildup along the gum line, which can be particularly challenging to remove with even the best electric toothbrushes.  I put extra effort into removing gum-line plaque for all my teeth, and especially the affected teeth, but could not stop the bleeding/soreness while brushing those particular two teeth.<br /><br />Before visiting my dentist, I thought I'd give this paste a try.  These first few times I used it I wanted to vomit.  Yes, it tastes pretty bad - especially if you're used to regular toothpaste.  However, I did get used to the taste after a while and now it doesn't even bother me.  Yes, it causes a film like buildup that looks like a slimy booger when you remove it, however, after about a week of use I no longer experience this.  If this is really bothering you, I recommend reducing the amount you spread on your brush.<br /><br />Moreover, this toothpaste has done remarkably well in reducing the bleeding and soreness on those two teeth.  I can now properly clean each inflicted teeth with my electric toothbrush without any pain or blood.  I had some light staining around the gum line on my teeth, and I'm pleased to see that the stains are fading quite significantly.  Overall, my mouth and teeth feel far better now having used the Crest Pro-Health than before.<br /><br />This is my routine that helped improve my oral care significantly:<br /><br />- After breakfast: Electric brush with regular toothpaste, floss, and then followed by alcohol-free mouthwash<br />- After Lunch or Mid-Afternoon (at-work): Light-brush with a soft-bristled manual toothbrush and regular toothpaste.  This helps prevent the buildup of plaque, especially important if you drink/eat a lot of sugary items<br />- Before Bed - Electric Toothbrush with Crest Pro-Health after flossing.  I did not use mouthwash and never rinsed my mouth with water after the initial \\"spit\\".  I figured it was better to keep as much of the toothpaste around the gums/teeth rather than rinsing it out.  This took some practice as the bad taste makes it difficult to resist the urge to rinse it out, but I believe this has helped speed up the improvement process.<br /><br />Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised.  I hope I can shed some light on helping improve gum problems, but speaking with your dentist is always best.  Good luck!
B000K11MNS|5|This is a wonderful product.  You have instant satifaction!  Only a small amount needed--well worth the price!
B000FPE2BS|5|I'd been using this product for years with great results, but for some reason, I guess to try new things, I quit. Lately, my hair, which is very thick, wavy (which I straighten) and hi-lighted, had been feeling rather dry and looking lackluster. I decided to go back to Potion 9 and O.M.G. I cannot believe the body, great texture and shine that returned to my hair. Your style will look great and last for days!  I should never have quit. This product should be in a hair product Hall of Fame.
B007MTL2PY|1|I really don't like the scent at all. Also, the shampoo and conditioner are just OK. I probably won't finish using this; I'll probably just throw out the rest and buy something different. I really wanted to love it.
B000OGBLQ2|3|I thought the smell was going to stay on me for the whole day but it did not. I wasn't too happy with the smell as well because it wasn't strong enough.
B005NWO9J8|4|I bought the barbers classic and the clean cut gels to see which was better and clearly it is the clean cut. the barbers classic is too goopy and messy for me. save your money and dont buy the barbers classic. this clean cut is a much better product and holds my hair much better. only down side it is very expensive for the amount you are buying.
B002Q67HRK|5|fast shipping, reasonable price
B00DMEOGE2|5|This was a repeat purchase as a gift.  I was asked for this from the same person who LOVE it!
B001MA0QY2|5|I bought this flat iron to take on a trip to China. Of course I needed a plug adapter, but the iron worked perfectly and I am thrilled. I have also used it in the USA with perfect results. This is a great product at a reasonable price.
B0044938JI|5|Choose this rating because the product does what it says it will.<br />Love this product.<br />yes I would recommend this product to everyone.
B007OT1QN0|1|These headbands are worthless. They don't hold hair back,they aren't even decorative. I DO NOT recommend.
B004ZJ0ZS4|5|So far so good.  Love the size and the power of this little gem. I think it's a keeper and well worth the money, but still cheaper than a similar version that retails for $300.
B003EBNLIA|5|Love these! I've had em for about a year now. So affordable and the staying power is awesome plus they're super pigmented. My favorite is Orange which is the most beautiful red that looks great alone, Pinky, a pretty magenta that looks awesome under pink lipstick, and Tangerine, a satin-finish nude pink that is amazing with a clear gloss ontop.
B003DLTGEO|5|This soap has a beautiful spicy fragrance. Though expensive it lasts much longer than most soaps of similar quality. Try it!
B005FJQQMC|5|Arrived in 2 weeks, in great condition.  These are nice dotting tools! The price was good and after using them for about a month now, I can tell you that they are very good quality and I recommend them very highly. Totally happy with this purchase!
B006OMJ0FE|5|It is all right. It is great. It is exactly like view. It is a very good Parfum Spray for women.
B001BLMNBG|4|I really like this mirror. I was worried that it would be low quality because it was affordable but it was not. The light was bright enough for me. The mirror is well worth the money.
B0091OCBNK|4|I have combination skin.  Oily/acne pretty much down the center of my face from the outside corners of my eyes up and down.  Then the sides of my cheeks and temples are normal to dry.  And I have a light case of rosacea on my nose and along the sides of it which leave it slightly to very pink and with slightly thicker skin.  I bought this to complement with the clarifying night cream also by Anadlou Naturals and alternate nightly which cream I use.  My skin seems to do well with this practice.<br /><br />I love the purple color.  It's a lovely shade of lavender.  The smells is positively delightful.  I always take a deep breath every time I open the jar.  It smells wonderful.  A littler goes a very long way I have found.  Even a finger-full can be too much for covering the face and the neck.  Takes a little trial and error to figure out how little/much to put on your finger.
B00M66BJOW|5|So far I really like this device.  I think it does what it says.  Went on youtube to watch tutorials on usage...that helped a lot.  I use every few days and can feel a difference.  I will review again after I've had it for awhile but so far so good.
B003O6L5MO|5|OMG, OPI, I LOVE YOU!  This is the most comfortable cuticle nipper that I've ever used.  It was so wonderful that I purchased two...just in case I lose one.  The adorable pink handle does not cut into the base of my thumb (like so many other brands did).  Plus, the nipper nips the cuticle perfectly!
B00538TSMU|4|I ordered these back in November, and I never wrote a review, so here it goes! I originally bought these for cosplay, but I've found myself wearing them even on a daily basis. They really do accentuate your eyes amazingly, and don't even feel like they're there. I really wish they would stay on for longer periods of time, but that might just be the glue I'm using. They are a bit stiff and quite long after opening, so I roll the lashes between my fingers and cut the ends off a bit before I put them on. Though, the price is something you can't beat. I'll be buying from this seller again!
B003CIT5OE|5|This is my favorite eyeliner by a mile! It is a gorgeous grey/blue and I wear it nearly everyday! Thank you for having it here!
B0037HP9OA|3|It works pretty well, doesn't get as close as a razor, and I usually have to finish it off with one. Definitely good to be able to trim down all those neglected long hairs at first though
B001SERK9G|2|This is a knockoff of the Clairsonic dermabrasion brush. I haven't used a Clairsonic, because I'm cheap, but after reading lots of reviews I've found the Pretika is compared favourably, with the exception that the bristles are a little harder, so not as good for sensitive skin.    I have had my Pretika for two months now, and have followed all instructions correctly. I used it for less than a week and it stopped working. After leaving it for a few days it started working again, and I didn't have any problems. Now, the motor is starting to sound strange and laboured while I use it, and I suspect it will stop working permanently before too long. There is a very good reason this product only has a one-month warranty - I don't think the manufacturers expect it to work much longer than that.     Based on my experience I went back and re-read reviews, and realized that most of the glowing reviews are based on using the brush for a couple of days up to a month. The majority of reviews from anyone using the Pretika longer than a month or two begin to mention malfunctions and defects.     I enjoy what this product does for my skin, but do not trust that it's lifespan will be more than 3 or 4 months. Conversely, I have read reviews by people who have had Clairsonics which continued to function for many years. The bottom line is, while the Clairsonic is much more expensive, it sounds like it's actually a more sensible economic choice for anyone who plans to continue to use sonic dermabrasion over the long term. While I'm happy to have had the opportunity to try it out before investing in the more expensive Clairsonic, I don't believe the cost is worth a short-term trial.
B0006NZNL2|5|I use this for castor oil packs for liver function. I fold the product in half and it is the perfect size. It is not itchy/scratchy on my skin. Very comfortable. Exactly what I was looking for.
B00JC0ZPE0|3|Good but way overpriced. It would be a good buy at half the price.
B002R046J2|3|Not what the picture shows. The picture shows 0.46% Triclosan - which is why I ordered it.<br />What arrived is 0.20% Benzalkonium chloride which may be fine but it's NOT what is shown.<br />(It may have been recently reformulated - I couldn't find the 0.46% Triclosan in a drug store either)
B00K2RFAX8|5|Great Mask Brush! I use it every day applying the leftover of my morning smoothie.
B0073XQP6K|1|No my hair is now drier then it was before. I have long hair that is somewhat dry, sO if you have dry hair this product is not worth the money<br />Unhappy
B00J8QKVTM|5|Love to use these I think I currently have over 50.
B0073ULCWU|5|This old-fashioned deodorant and anti-antiperspirant is still the best.  It is easy to apply, very effective at perspiration and odor control and has a delicate, lovely (slightly spicy?) scent.  It has become harder and harder to find in stores -- I really hope it continues to be available on Amazon.
B012V8WOB6|5|I have realized that you need to change the roller head frequently to get the best results with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi. Problem is, Emjoi brand replacement rollers are expensive... luckily Sinsun makes these affordable replacement heads that work as good as the original. They are very coarse and tough on calluses. The only real difference between these and the original. in my opinion, is the price . I would recommend these replacement rollers any day!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.
B00B2SUW84|2|Didnt care for this product.  Gave it to my daughter who loves it.
B0018OWHQM|5|So this color is so perfect! Looks exactly like the picture. And with a top coat lasts a decent amount of time. LOVE it!
B002HK2GQM|1|This would be a four star review but the \\"lifetime guarantee/free sharping\\" is just terrible. I use these little scissors as a beard & mustache trimmer. The slight curve makes them great for that. After many, many years they wore out and became dull so I ordered another pair and in doing so noticed their guarantee.  I went on-line, filled out and printed a sharpening form, and mailed them off. More than a full month later I received an e-mail saying they received them. More than ANOTHER  month passes and I received them worse off then when I send them in. They still won't cut whiskers and now the screw holding the two halves together is buggered up terribly. Not a bad product really - but to claim: \\"Our implements are guaranteed to perform and are guaranteed against manufacturing defects. We will sharpen or replace (at our option) the defective implement FREE.\\" - is sort of stretching the truth a bit.
B00GVGTVTS|5|It is so hard to find quality tweezers for eyelash  extensions and these are tops for an amazing price!  So happy I found these
B004NMR6TY|5|These are great especially when you are trimming the kids' bangs.  In fact I did my own...
B00DPE9EQO|1|I purchased this based on having seen it in a magazine and reading the thousands of reviews.  It is not potent AT ALL!  Going back to my original vitamin C serum.  This is like water....not sure it has active vitamin C.
B00JVXNKCM|5|If you do research you will see that too much keratin causes acne and other skin problems, and this product does a fantastic job of removing it. I have been using this for a month now and it is much better than the neutrogena version. The results are great and my skin finally feels smooth! I keep at least a few bottles in my bathroom all the time just in case i run out, and i would recommend this to anybody who wants to get rid of that extra keratin. It doesn't irritate skin and feels like it is actually smoothing out your skin when you apply it.
B007V6754K|4|Great product, I am sleeping great, and not feeling smothered..
B00584GUTS|5|I had been looking a long time for this product and finally found it here. I used to get it from Mexico, but it was discontinued and replaced by a watered-down version that doesn't give me the same results. It prevents my gums from getting swollen or itchy.
B006IB8CW8|4|I like this color and product.  I ordered it twice.  the only drawback was that it thickens too quickly
B004BEBVZ4|5|I have used every tanner on the market and worked at Palm beach tan for years so I know how to look good with a fake tan! This stuff is the best, so dark and long lasting. Never streaking, odor isn't bad and I am always glowing! I get so many compliments!
B00A0K9T2A|5|What i expected.
B003NF2W28|5|I have many many many wigs and this is one of my favorites. I get compliments and alot of folks think it is my real hair lol. Go for it and try one out.
B002C4IQSU|5|Good for controlling effects of aging. Like the texture and and scent. Vendor's price is much less than at local retailers.
B004INUWX0|3|I am not absolutely positive how I feel about the Spin Air.<br /><br />My first impression was \\"OMG it's huge, awkward and is going to tangle my hair into a mess!\\"<br /><br />That being said, it definitely IS a huge device which if you need to use for a length of time (if you have really long or thick hair) it gets to be very awkward and your arm gets tired and achey, as well as your hands. It is very thick/fat and uncomfortable to use after a while.<br /><br />If your hair is really long (mine is past the bra strap) you have much greater tendency to tangle if you are not absolutely precise and accurate with your movements, positioning and control of the brush .. not to mention you have to precisely control the spinning by pressing/holding the button in. It is definitely a task and something to get used to. Getting the back of your hair without tangling or running into other issues, when it is long, is definitely a challenge.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, the results are pretty good (they'd better be for all the effort involved!!!) BUT I can get the same results with less hassle, in less time, just by using my regular brush and hair dryer. With the Spin air, you DO still get fly aways if you do not use the right styling products and techniques. This device is not a cure-all.<br /><br />The Spin Air takes longer to dry your hair as well. It did for me anyway, but again my hair is longer.<br /><br />For the price, I cannot justify it's worthiness. I mean, it is a neat idea, but it is expensive as an added \\"tool\\" when we already use a hair dryer to begin with. This isn't something I could/would use everyday in place of my dryer and brush .. it is not easier, it is not a time saver and it provides no better results.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who likes extra gadgets to use every now and then and you don't mind spending this amount of money, then sure, go for it. But, if you're looking for a total replacement to your dryer and brush, do not buy this... or at least not at full price. I think the Spin Air should be around the $20-30 price range at most. That is just my opinion, but I don't see anything amazing in it's ability or in it build quality to justify the current price.<br /><br />I also would never recommend this for anyone with shorter than chin length hair - the round brush head is just wayy too big to be useful.s... or at least not at full price.

B00GYTP05G|5|Gave as Christmas Gift she was so excited to receive this for Christmas she can't wait to go on vacation this summer to use this.
B00MM40SNG|5|I absolutely love my set soft and perfect for my day to day application, I would compare to my MAC brush set. Good quality.
B002WTC37A|1|I bought this because I have heard so many good things on youtube and from friends so I bought it from amazon because they were selling it for half the price but I guess it was too good to be true. It is not the same one my friends had! they sent me a fake one.. When I opened it the jar the product was pink when it's suppose to be white and mine is really lumpy. Going to return it soon and bought a real one at ulta, which is white and no lumps. I know it is a lot cheaper on amazon but it's not the real thing.
B000HQ0L2E|4|This is the most effective whole body shaver I've tried. I purchased one last November, but dropped it, and it broke.  The second one I bought stopped working, but the company replaced it without any question. I did not have to return either of the previous ones.  I've had the current one for four months, and I use it once a week.  It gives close non-irritating shaves and is easy to clean and use.  One negative:  the batteries are not rechargeable.
B00CDJAMNG|4|Love them soft and works great
B00HVV2G5S|1|I won't purchase this product again. It doesn't compare to the original formula, even with the new added ingredient. Now i will have to spend more money and order the original.
B000K7J1PI|5|Great product
B0001TSWYQ|3|I don't know what to feel about this product. It's okay I guess but I feel that it doesn't really work as good. So I'm neutral about this product.
B004813W5M|5|As I age, my eye sight is getting worse and worse.  I had an 8X before I got this one, it was wonderful, had it probably, 8 years or more.  So, when my eyes changed, I felt I needed to get the stronger mirror.  I now have the 10x.  WOW, what a difference.  I can see now.
B000HDSVWY|4|i love the way this cream smoothes onto my skin.  It leaves it feeling soft and I think it's a little firmer.  I haven't used it long enough  to know if it's reducing any wrinkles, and it really doesn't have an aroma as some creams do.  However, I'm quite pleased with the cream so far.
B008S3U39E|3|its cheap so i guess its ok<br />i like the color<br />but it pinches your skin on the edges<br />i wouldnt buy again
B005C4WPUW|5|I have always used this hand cream as I feel it is the best for dry or chapped hands. And the 2 pack at a great price cannot be beaten.
B004KZKXQC|4|Got this for a school fundraiser. Great hit with the kids since process looks close to real tattooing! The instruction were very confusing but ones you use it, it's very easy! I would recommend it:)
B0018QTQOG|4|absolutely wonderful blowdryer but didn't last all that long.  Had to replace it already.  I have always loved Hot Tools.
B001NIOK3Q|5|I have been looking for this tooth brush for quite some time,every thing was perfect from price to delivery  and the tooth brush performs excellently
B001TJXI5U|5|I've used NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils for years. People need to realize that these really aren't designed to be cream eyeshadows. They're best when used as a base for your eyeshadow to help it be more vibrant. So, if it runs all off your eyes andsmudges everywhere, that's why. It's not eyeshadow, it's a base. A very, very good one.
B006ZENPYS|1|I had researched and read every 80 5 star reviews at the time of purchase. According to the research, it is supposed to work best on fair skin. I'm a blue-eyed blonde. I read and followed the directions exactly. Although I'm fair skinned, I rarely have any problems with skin creams, cleansers, etc. I applied the solution according to instructions. Near the end of time limit, I noticed \\"icing\\" or \\"frosting\\" in one area. I immed. rinsed with cold water over a minute before applying the neutralizer. Approx. 7 - 10 days later, my skin was so inflamed, we had to leave  our vacation to Hilton Head early. I spent the entire trip inside. My face was so swollen, I could not shut my left eye completely. I had 2 doctor visits followed by a recent trip to the E.R. where I was diagnosed with peri-orbital cellulitis, an infection and inflammation of skin cells. Mine completely surrounded my left eye. It had the appearance someone had punched my eye. It's painful, burning and itching tissue with exudate.  Apparently, this product is supposed to work on the 1st layer of skin (epidermis.) Skin has 3 layers, Second layer is the dermis, followed by sub-cutaneous. When the white \\"icing/frosting\\"  appears, it indicates the product has gone deeper to the 2nd or 3rd layer. This is what occurred with me. Skin has natural bacteria living on it. When there was a break in the skin,(can be so small to view with the naked eye) bacteria can enter. I had to receive IV antibiotics, a CAT scan to rule out Ocular Cellulitis which would have lead to emergency surgery. I'm on my 5th round of antibiotics. I'm also a Reg. Nurse. Fortunately, due to my background, I recognized the urgency to seek more care. I'm sure the co. is worried about a lawsuit. I have no intentions to file, as I realize there is always a risk, regardless of number of 5 star reviews. Nothing is ever 100%. In fact I gave the rest to my best friend who loved it. She has a darker skin tone and brown eyes. I even bought her a second bottle for her birthday. According to statistics, most love the product. I was the exception.

B003S6CVIC|5|Works great, exactly what my guy wanted and needed.  He has had it a couple of months now and it still works great
B000XEB6N8|5|I am so happy with my purchase of mambo mix. I love all of liz claiborne perfumes. This one is a very sweet and spicy scent. I love the hint of juicy floral and sweet fruits together!
B00152VMNG|4|I have used and liked Tabu Dusting Powder for years. To me, the scent of Tabu Dusting Powder is comforting and reminiscent of other times. It makes my skin feel cool and pampered after a shower at the end of a hot summer day. Also, as a grown woman, I don't want to smell like a baby and Tabu Dusting Powder certainly doesn't smell like baby powder.
B00D8ZOVIQ|4|The Greenair Aroma Diffuser, Spa Mister works beautifully.  I've had it for about a month.  The lights, mist and automatically shut off is exactly as described.  The actual misting time lasts longer than 4 hours.  I am very satisfied with this product.
B00FS6NAL2|1|We thought these bulbs might change a bit ....slower? Hey, if you like busy (psychedelic twinkling) lights, these are for you!
B000F4USEY|2|No matter how closely you follow the directions, it just doesn't work for all hair types. I bought this thinking it would be cool to not have to deal with stubble anymore, but it just does not work with my hair type. Not only does it hurt.. A LOT! It doesn't pull out my hair. It breaks it off near the skin. I then didn't even get the 'smooth' stage before I had stubble.  It works for thicker hair, but if you have really thin hair like I do.. I don't recommend this.
B003ATS2QC|5|This scale is very nice looking, accurate, and a good purchase for the money. The number display is large and vibrant, and its nice not to having to tap it initially (you just step on to get a reading). I would definitely recommend it.
B0019ZB6YO|3|I'm 47, had my 3rd (and last) child 4 years ago and started to notice several age spots on my face. Tried lots of different creams, cheap and expensive. Nothing really worked. Saw this product and gave it a try. I don't use it every night, but after about 2 months I did start to notice some of the spots had faded a bit. I'm going on the 4th month of use and can say this product works, but it's not the miracle cure I had hoped for. The price is good if you're reluctant to spend a lot. I've spent way more with little or no results on other products.
B00L2SWF7K|4|Seems like a good product and good value!
B004PXIR1W|5|This product is truly great. It cuts through my coarse facial hair with ease.  the digital length gauge works flawlessly, and makes it very easy to get the exact same cut every time. The battery hold extremely well. I love this product and it will definitely be all of my buddies' christmas gifts this year.
B00CQ1DKZS|3|didn't like it texture that it produced
B0096DSOGE|5|Yes it works well.  Nice colors
B003YMJJSK|5|I have insanely sensitive skin and this cleanser does not irritate it. Unlike some of the creamier options, this product feels like it really cleans.
B0011DP7Q2|5|I love the gentle, fresh cleansing I get from using Dr Woods - Shea Vision Castile Soap with Lavendar.  It is so gentle on my skin unlike bar soaps.  I won't ever be without this in my house.
B004WLKXE6|5|I have been using this for over a year now. I do have a wax pot and I do my own waxing at home, but I just can't get the lip waxing down for some reason. I find the strips to be easier, quicker (no waiting for the wax pot to heat-up) and no mess! I would recommend these to any woman who doesn't like paying for salon waxing every other week. I've only used them on the lip, so I can't speak to how they work for eyebrows. Note: it takes a little practice in the beginning just be sure to rub the strips in between your palms for the recommended time, to warm them up.
B00006IVEN|4|Decent clippers, came on time!! No complaints
B00008V407|5|Being a slicer and dicer, I am so thrilled to finally have a product that doesn't draw blood.  The first time I used it I noticed how soft my skin was and needed not one single band aid!  Hooray for woman kind!  I will never use a razor or rip my sensitve skin off with wax or burn myself with depillatory products ever again.  Trust me ladies, you will love this hair remover.
B00HD2YTLO|5|I have tried 3 different charcoal soaps and this is by far my favorite. The black lets you know you're getting clean :)
B006UR2ED8|4|I used these for my toes, but the instructions didn't work out. The clear plastic sheet on top is a pain. You have to be REALLY slow when removing it first (before the white paper back), because if the nail polish pulls up with it, you might as well throw that one away. Kept a pair of tweezers handy in case it started to do this. They were easy to put on though and I just used the orange stuck to smooth and cut away the excess. It doesn't tell you to, but I also painted over it with a clear top coat so it would stay on. Looks really nice though. Looking into other patterns for a match mani/pedi later.
B005XUNG5I|5|I regularly receive pedicures, so this works so well! I know some people said it doesn't but I think they may have a lot of course dead skin, they probably just need to buy replacement rollers.  I get a pedicure every other week, but for the past two months I haven't been able to get up to the salon and this worked so nicely, and I had quite a bit of rough skin that dragged on my sheets when i went to bed.  This little guy took it all off like magic.
B003I7TWOC|1|its false your only gonna get 1 shampoo! the picture is misleading you should take it down asap. I thought it was the combo pack. I give amazon 5 stars for customer service they took care of it and threw in the shampoo for free thanks amazon and in a way thanks guy who misled me
B0006FVCWY|5|I purchased a Pondicherry Sandlewood Votiva candle for my boyfriend. I walked into a specialty store that had one burning. It was heavenly and made the shopping experience so enjoyable that I had to have one! He loves it as much as I did. Now I am happy to be able to find them on Amazon and will try all the fabulously named candles. Long lasting and simply luxurious!
B00ELN94GS|5|Works great for my skin.  I love it!  Not greasy at all and my pores look tighter only after using for a week!  I can't wait to see the results after a month!
B001E0VOW8|5|This soap is fantastic. The smell is a little strong right out of the box but don't let that deter you from giving it a try. Long lasting moisture. I don't have any major skin problems other than dry skin. This soap helps remedy that but it won't replace a good lotion for your skin type. There is an exfoliant aspect to this which has helped with dry/dead skin.<br /><br />Decent price and it arrived very quickly.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product to anyone.
B00AYNNX34|2|I decided on the 2 star ranking because I feel this in an inferior product as compared to the other brands of lavender bath salts I've previously used. The salt used in this product may or may not be beneficial - no way to compare. My reason for purchasing this lavender infused product was because I love the lavender fragrance. The fragrance disappears within 5 minutes when diluted in lingers.<br /><br />I purchased this product because I liked the value pack two pound size. I also buy my gourmet salts from SFBC. I didn't like the fact the fragrance dissipated by the time the bath crystals dissolved. I love to relax with a warm/hot bath when feeling stressed. SFSC's lavender fragrance is GONE within minutes. So much for lavender&#34;s relaxation benefits! I especially love Pre De Provence Lavender Bath Salts. I should never have switched brands. I thought I was getting a comparative product for less money. Pre De Provence Bath Salts have a wonderful lavender fragrance that lingers during the entire bath soak and the gentle fragrance lingers on the skin after the bath.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.
B000FEGUIM|5|I was looking for this exact shaver at Black Friday 06, but they had sold out (surprise). I'm glad I waited to get this from Amazon with free prime shipping. The shave is good and it is super quiet. I also like how light-weight it is.
B005ING9B8|5|This is adorable! The eyeshadows are highly pigmented and the colors are great. I like 2 out of the 3 blushes a lot. The lip glosses don't have the most comfortable texture but the colors are very nice and wearable.
B00LOOHA0O|5|Great for curly hair.
B000S17FTU|2|I got this clipper just over a year ago to replace the old Oster clipper I started Barber School with back in 1967. I chose the 111 because I could use the same heads that I had for my old reliable. I must admit that at first I was impressed. The clipper preformed to expectations, but then - in the middle of a haircut(with out warning)the plastic drive gear that transfers power to the head stripped out rendering the clipper useless. I have ordered a new gear to replace the old, but have also ordered a Oster 76. I will use the 111 as a back up, and hope the 76 is a better clipper. I think the 111 may work well for lighter use, but to use the term \\"professional,\\" may be misleading.
B000292RJG|5|I have been sensitive for years and years with sun damaged arms. Am using dermablend for the first time and I am very satisfied. True it does look a bit like face base makeup but for me that is ok. I just keep thinking this is what Lindsay Lohan must use on her face, in case you have ever seen her mug shots. ugh) in s short while my skin appears moist again and I am happy as a lark.
B004KVGN0G|1|There needs to be 3 soap boxes in one pack. However, one of the boxes came empty! It is possible that it is a production mistake but if all packs have the same problem, then it is a problem!
B003JTOS0C|3|I really love the scent.  But the overriding problem is that the scent lasts only about 15 minutes...doesn't matter how much or how its applied (directly on skin, clothes, or a combination of both - 5 squirts, 10 squirts, 15 squirts..), by the time I get into my car in the morning...no more Nautica Blue smell.  Shame...I really like this scent...it's a very good daily scent, not overpowering.  This is going to make me leery of buying cologne off of Amazon in the future.
B0011UVCKU|5|Conditioner is great - smells good too. I have very fine hair and need a conditioner that's not \\"heavy.\\" Leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy. Will buy again.
B00D9NV2D4|5|Love this stuff! Great product
B002SVIDDK|5|I rate this product as the best Iever used it stays on all day compared to others I have used
B001JJBC9Y|5|The Oster Fast Feed clipper is worth every penny.  It does a fantastic job everytime.  I tried bying the 10 piece attachment to go with the clipper however those attachments do not connect with the Oster Fast Feed.
B00M79ULKQ|5|Thick and covers very well
B001UB27CM|5|What I received is a true Respironics brand strap - and it's great, supporting the chin vertically rather than pulling both upward and back.  The chin cup has no stretch (ideal).  The sides are stretchy enough to allow conscious jaw movement, but firm enough to reliably prevent a jaw from opening while sleeping.  Far more resistant to coming off at night than most straps I've used.
B006UUW91C|1|The picture does not match the item. I love the surreal original and thought I was buying that one because of the picture. Granted I did not notice the description said surreal garden I thought it was stupid to have the wrong picture. So misleading. Plus my mom had this kind and I hate the smell. If you like floral smell it is alright for you.
B00Y3U79MA|4|Great mascara, love the volume it provides
B0081MQ47C|5|I really like it so far.  I am kind of concerned with how to get reasonably priced replacement heads though.
B00HL7J99I|5|I've been using all the face products from CT Organics for two weeks and my skin is clear, smooth, and glowing. I love how truly organic the products really are. I had acne prone skin, and now my skin is moisturized and blemish free. It is super easy to order and is at your door within a couple days. So glad I switched from my other face products. Thanks CT Organics!!!
B0012RQZ72|5|I love the way it smells, I would definitely buy it again.
B000G33KEO|5|i bought this for my mom's nails as she has thin nails that tear easily and are just all around unhealthy---even with taking supplements.  this coating has helped TREMENDOUSLY!  she is using it regularly and thrilled with it.  THANK YOU!
B00ARTKAHW|5|Good price and good quality products. We love it!
B0048IFLBI|2|I had high hopes for this product and wanted to like it. It just didn't work for me. I felt like I had more razor burn and nicks while using this product. Plus, you need a good amount to work up a lather suitable for shaving.
B000MUBRB4|5|It's hard to find really soft tooth brushes in stores.  These are great.  I've ordered them several times.  My teeth get clean without unnecessary abrasion.
B000CONLRI|3|As much as I love Prevage, this version caused an allergic reaction on my nect and face.  This version is so strong, even one drop mixed with water still caused me to go red and swollen.  Everyone is different, so if your not allergic, then it is a wonderful product.  Just be cautious when using.
B00AXRGN10|4|I really like this color, but it seems a little &#34;Cakey&#34; on me, especially if I reapply (which I usually do). After 7 years, I'm still exploring mineral foundations, but I think I like the original physicians formulas better than the BB cream. I've used Bare Minerals and Mary Kay mineral powder, and physicians formula compares closey with them in quality.
B00ATWDTIE|5|its alittle denser than i thought it would be but it is manageable. this is not a bad product for paying so little
B00MNIKOGC|5|I have curly hair and this is my go-to shampoo/conditioner. I have tried other recommendations but keep coming back to this set.
B005975A90|5|Bought this for my daughter and I ended up using it.  I like floral scents, beachy scents, and this combines them both beautifully.  I love this perfume and it is now one of my regulars.
B0002A65LQ|5|Unbelievable. I've had pretty moderate acne since I was 12 years old (twenty years of fun!) and was using a prescription-level retinol that only really worked at certain times of the month, when my stress levels were low, when the moon was aligned with Venus, etc. So I decided to give Philosophy's Help Me a whirl after reading the reviews, and made myself use it for five or six weeks before writing my own review. So it's official: Any acne I once had is just plain GONE. I barely even wear makeup any more. There is simply no point. I can't really vouch for its line-reduction qualities as I didn't really have any to start with (one of the trade-offs of oily skin: stupid breakouts, but no wrinkles) but I did notice that I loved the way it made my skin feel: soft, smooth, and definitely youthful. If you're in your late twenties/early thirties and are still struggling with breakouts, I cannot recommend this stuff enough. It is miraculous.
B0077CNO1G|5|Age 40. Extremely surprised. Results are not immediate however I have measured a difference after 3 uses. Must keep regimen regular to continue to see results. It has evened out my pores and tightened the skin around my eyes and jaw line. Note: results are minimal and not as effective as if you used a professional device. I have been using this about 4 months now.
B008RRV7R8|4|easy to manage. like how buns is perfectly done. I get lots of complements when I use it. i recomend it.
B005C1C02S|5|These came in the mail really fast. They stick to my nails pretty easily with just a dab of nails polish and they stay. Some of the stones were out of place, but that's okay. There are a large variety of shapes and sizes so you can do many different styles on your nails. Would buy again. Although it would take me awhile considering the fact that there are soooo many stones.
B00DQ2I0G0|5|Not bad.. I don't really have a lot experience with these kinds of products so... I ask around what I should expect. I've only tried it once since I recently received it. I applied it for a minute as suggested for the first time use. My face was really tingling/stinging by then. I rinsed my face in lukewarm tap water and applied an organic moisturizer. ( I had read somewhere in one review that it helps calm the stinging sensation ) and it felt great. My face was a little red for about an hour, nothing too crazy. And the following day a friend commented and asked if I had done something to my face because it looked good.. it fells good too.. I'll wait another 4 weeks as suggested for the 2nd application. I love this!
B001MKJPM6|5|This is an awesome product.  You can buy 3 times cheaper from someplace else though.
B00OHZF98C|3|Didn't really notice much of a difference, but my skin did seem a bit more moisturized.
B00141E4RE|3|It was delivered on time... But it looks like it was a refurbished blade. There were nicks throughout the blade and pieces of hair in the packaging

B000PXYB84|5|In a few minutes you can have a great hairstyle.  I really depend on this and it is hard to find in the stores!
B0058E3XJI|1|This left my skin spotted & orange. I made sure I was covered evenly before tanning but left looking like an oompa loompa :( the bronzer was a bit too strong
B00LITWPQE|5|Gentle on our gums, pleasant flavor and stays intact to do the job. I assume this costs a bit more than other floss, and the comfort is well worth it for us.
B002B1K6JG|5|Great product! Superfast Shipper!!!!
B004WSXD4G|3|I was hoping after all the great reviews that this product would work.  It doesnt.  Ive used it for a month and all it has done is make my skin softer.  I dont understand how everyone with these reviews is seeing results and I am not, but i was hopeful.  Cellulite is almost impossible to rid of unless you lose a lot of weight or have it sucked out :(
B0036QTJDO|5|The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft and silky. Cannot do without the styling elixir!  Love the smell and shine it gives to my hair
B000NJBELW|1|i needed to return this item I purchased for $123.00 due to an order mistake.  The package was not opened. Seller requested that i pay for the return shipping which cost me $55!!!  Hardly justifies the purchase - will never use this vendor again!!!
B0041U2VIE|5|ok
B000O01CL2|5|I have been using this perfume for a couple of years now, and when I first purchased it, I bought it from Sephora's. Wherever I go, I always get compliments from both men and women. My friends always ask where I get it. I just recently discovered that it is a lot less on Amazon. So I HIGHLY reccomend this product...and if you have never smelt it, you're missing out. =)
B005FYAM0O|5|Love  this  suffer  thanks
B000063XHQ|2|I have had two ER411 Nose and Ear Hair Groomers before making this recent purchase. I thought those ER411 groomers were perfect. You could cut on the end as well as the side making them very effective. Panasonic has changed the inner blade design so that it cuts only on the side. The old design was referred to as a curved blade design. Panasonic packaging still refers to the ER411 having the curved blade. In phone calls to Panasonic I have been told that the new design is in effect now.
B007P29930|5|Excellent, solid clip.  The spring mechanism is extremely tight, allowing it to grasp a lot of thick hair very easily.<br /><br />FYI, don't leave it in the shower/around water, as it will rust pretty easily (I've unfortunately learned this from experience).
B00GX94RNI|5|I have oily/combination skin and this product is a power house it deep cleans and purges my pores it can be drying but I follow up with a oil free cream, I would not recomend this for sensitive skin types though
B009JP1T9S|1|Worse hair care products - will NOT buy again
B00269INMU|4|These apply my makeup smoothly and seem to absorb less of it, which saves me money. And, as they are easily washable, I use them over and over again, so a package lasts me for months.
B0000B11WD|5|It's all I use in my house. My husband loves this stuff and it works so well. Itchy skin will drive you up the wall and Gold Bond spray is wonderful and gets rid of the itch. And it has antibiotic properties too, which is great!
B0043NYODO|3|Wasn't as pictured, same design but it was the one with soft white tips. Still a nice brush, though. Wasn't as pictured, same design but it was the one with soft white tips. Still a nice brush, though.  I really like using this brush with my foundations and blushes, because it distributes it evenly without clumping. I use the smaller end for concealers and even my eyeshadows. Main picture displayed shows a single ended foundation brush, and I received a double ended brush. While I have been happy with the brush, I would recommend posting a more accurate picture, which is why I only gave it three stars instead of five.
B00V6FGP98|5|Like the combination it was worth the money.
B007UMQ410|5|Why didn't I think of this? It works for so many ailments, beautifully designed and easy to use.
B00CP4H3T0|5|Very much, easy to use, frequency of use after charging too much, do not waste electricity, I feel very comfortable, reasonably priced
B000COJHNU|5|Johan B Merveille is a fragrance that I fell in love with. When I first smelled it, I was shopping while vacationing in Aruba. At that point, the store only had one box left. Of course I bought it! I had been looking for it once I arrived back on the states, but some of the time, I had no luck. Other times, it was overpriced. Meaning, the cost for larger bottles were sometimes $10-$20 more than what I paid in Aruba. After I found Johan B on Amazon, I was a happy camper. Johan B Merveille is a very light fragrance and has an awesome, sweet smell. It's one of my favorites! It stays with you throughout the whole day. I will be ordering all my fragrances from Amazon!
B009HO26D4|2|Bit displeased, the nails were all discolored and yellowish instead of being clear like the image.
B00150SVRI|5|This is a great base coat nail polish. It prevents the regular color from damaging your nails or the color leaching through and staining your nails. It also prevents a lot of the dryness that you would otherwise have.
B00428DLCK|4|Works well for me. I use it with a Clairsonic face washer
B004RBZ9R2|5|I bought this at whole foods one day when I had a cold and thought vaseline might help with chapped skin.  I asked someone who worked there if they had anything that might help, and this product was recommended.  While this is more expensive than petroleum jelly, there is really no comparison.  I love this stuff!  My raw, chapped nose and lips looked and felt so much better so quickly! I carry this stuff around with me now. I put it on my cuticles on the way to a meeting and even without a manicure my nails looked great.  I burned my finger on a toaster and put this stuff on and the burn went away.  I look forward to learning and finding all the other uses for it, it is truly a great product and I'm so glad I found it. I don't want to hype it too much, but if you are on the fence, just try it.  The one I bought is a 2oz container, and even though I have been using it constantly, it seems like it will last a while.
B0026HSNXG|3|Nothing to write home about. Just a basic lotion in my opinion, no wow factor...sorry.
B001ECQ4QM|4|My continuing choice for a deoderant.
B000FH0WGU|5|This is a very moisturising product.  If you have dry skin, I recommend you use it every night regardless of which season.  If you have combination skin, I recommend you use it every night during winter and use it when needed during summer.  If you have oily skin, I would suggest you choose another night cream product from Sulwhasoo, the LIFTING CREAM(TANRUCK CREAM).  I also suggest you use the UV Protect Cream for the day and the Anti-Aging Eye Cream for both day and night.
B005G5E8B6|4|Nice clear polish with sparkles but there aren't as many as I would expect for a nail polish for sparkles. I was fishing for more sparkles when I put it on.
B00DSOY2OA|3|So I absolutely loooove this night serum!!! Whenever I purchase this from the Estée Lauder website I get the ANR II serum in perfect condition, but I received this serum with the dropper partially detached from the screw top lid. The serum itself still works great, but the last 1/3 of the bottle dried out. I will still purchase this serum, but I think I'll continue buying it from the Estée Lauder website.<br />Oh, and btw, I have super sensitive skin because of systemic lupus and this seriously works much better than the steroid creams at reducing my angry skin flare ups!
B00CWY8V9O|5|This product was recommended by my Dermatologist for moisturizing and replenishing, happy to report that it works very well. Non-greasy, very light fragrance. Great overall body lotion.
B005CROHJQ|5|This skincare product is the best I have used. It is hydrating. And after applying feels light on the face.<br />And for this price, Well worth the purchase.
B001VH6F9G|4|It's necessary to replace the foil and cutter head now and then. They don't last as long as I'd like. But if I must replace it, this is a good price and WalMart does not carry it consistently. Would get five stars if its sharpness lasted longer.
B000FPTENY|3|Price is too high and the lotion runs out too quickly.  Other than that, it seems like a good product.  I've gone through 3 tubes and can't tell if it makes me look younger, but I figured out that its not that important anyway.  Just be happy with yourself, unless you are really in a bad way and need the help.
B00HIDT94U|5|Recommended good quality
B00VG0Y6JO|3|I don't know if this stuff really works for dark circles I've been using it for 2 weeks and haven't seen a difference but idk maybe it takes longer. But it does make my eyes firmer
B00JITDVM8|5|good product.  works as advertised
B00DG8F04Y|3|We've been ordering this lotion for a while, and it feels great on our skin (makes my skin super soft).  However, Amazon ships it in one of those yellow envelopes with a single layer of bubble wrap. This last time we received it, though, it had burst in the envelope!  I opened the envelope, and a huge mess spilled out.  I had to clean the floor, wall AND my clothes.  Totally not worth the mess.
B004BD9152|5|I recommend it strongly. It very fresh and without alcohol. My sister and I like it very much.We bought several bottles.
B00KXMNDOA|4|This is a reallly nice Vitamin C & E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid. My skin really liked this product, it feels nice on the skin, it has improved my skin texture and has helped to diminish my fine lines. I have a full review on http://beautybymitchypoo.com
B00DU4FMY2|5|Great
B000C230TO|1|Yuck scent. No wonder it was priced so cheaply. But, if you savor heavy orientals, maybe you'll like it. I immediately resold the product on Craig's List at a loss.
B00PUMEREI|5|I absolutely am in love with this oil. There is nothing that I have found that even compares to it. I have so many issues with my skin, particularly my face. I have super oily skin in the t-zone, yet it also gets very dry and flaky. Very frustrating! As if that's not enough, my face is also sensitive to a lot of products.<br />Not a problem with Lux's Sweet Almond Oil. I've been using it at least twice a day on my face, neck and hands.I've also used it on my feet. My face is absolutely glowing! It's so dry that it's still just sucking up the moisture but it's definitely being moisturized. No breakouts. No overly oily skin. My feet... fabulous! Rub on the oil and cover with a pair of socks and all that dry, cracked skin is gone in minutes, literally. I hate when my feet snag things. So gross!<br />I haven't tried it on my head but, at times, I consider it. This winter weather really wreaks havoc on the skin, scalp and body.<br />I will continue to use this oil for as long as I can find it. It's well worth the money and only takes moments to apply but the results are remarkable. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
B006Z9UPQO|5|Wow--this really gets the job done--just like the professionals.
B008SX7H8E|2|Color is not the same as the photo. .
B0061DPB04|5|My hair feels amazing!
B00G7PCF0U|4|Effective anti-perspirant, smells good, decent price, non-irritating, BUT still wish it was a liquid or gel.
B000QF95G4|5|great product for fine, thin hair
B007SFWTCC|5|have been using this product for quite a while,<br />still doing good, reasonable price and well<br />packed :))
B003UF0RB4|5|I love this body wash. Helps with itchy dry skin. Will buy again for sure.
B0036SKP7Q|1|They do not send you the Clean Moisture Makeup Removal Cloths (AS LISTED) in the all-blue package, but instead send the new Ultimate Clear Oil Control Cloths with the orange label, which is a different, stronger formulation and not the same product at all.  Now debating whether it's worth paying the shipping to return them.  It's difficult to find the milder Clean Moisture cloths these days - stores just fill the existing shelf space with the orange ones without realizing they are two different products.  It's unfortunate.
B000QUM5LG|5|Removes my mascara effortlessly, great price comparing with Lancome.
B002DPUXZM|3|When this first came out, it was a must have accessory at the time. But I found the peppermint in particular dries my lips insanely. My lips would be more chapped after application in about 30 minutes. Despite this I still used it habitually because of how soothing and amazing the minty flavor felt. So refreshing. But the resulting chapped lips are not worth it and I finally grew out of it. I use Vaseline now, just one use overnight and viola! My lips are repaired the next morning.
B008I2IKI6|5|I thought this was rechargeable, but found out it takes a AA battery.  I almost returned it; however, the battery seems to last a long long time, so I'm very happy about it.  Plus, no charger cord on my counter!  The toothbrush works very good.  Not quite a &#34;Sonicare&#34;, but I got so tired of buying those expensive replacement heads, that I'm satisfied reducing the quality a bit to save a lot more money!  For the money, its a five star purchase for sure!  You really can't go wrong with this one.
B003BQVN42|5|I've been using jafra for years for skin care,,not makeup. I have sensitive skin and never had a problem with their products. Anytime I tried other face product lines, after a few weeks I'd get bumps under the skin or breakouts. So, enough of that! Staying with Jafra. I like simple routines and use RJMB all over face,neck, top of hands. Also love their time protector daytime moisturizer SPF 15 for daytime. I get lots of compliments on my skin. At 60!
B0010DKTG6|4|Good product!
B00CJ01QT8|3|can't use this product because it is making my skin very red.
B0099HHS0U|5|Nice
B0007W1R58|3|My daughter and I are disappointed that the formula for this has changed. We both liked the scent it used to have and the purple color. Why did it change? Its expensive but worth it, but I preferred the old formula.
B000QUI920|5|I use seche vite dry fast top coat and this is perfect to restore the perfect consistency. It was a very good surprise!
B004Z92VJA|5|I like the product and recomment it to anyone. It's really good for my hair. It feels soft and shiny
B004BCVAWA|5|One of my fav colors!
B00AX2R72E|5|Love the way the body butter makes my skin so smooth and the fragrance is so lovely.<br />Such a good feeling also knowing that it is made with all natural ingredients.<br />Going to recommend it to all my friends.
B00B2B2VGW|5|It's organic so I decided to give it to my dad for a try, and he had no regrets at all.. He was skeptical at first, thinking he would would lose the rest of his hair but after he started using Phytoworx his hair loss has reduced and has instead started to regrow. The shampoo is kind and gentle to his scalp and he has an easy time using it. He hasn't had any negative side effects so far and It was worth buying this shampoo. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a permanent solution to hair loss.
B0086VIA3O|1|Product is good - packaging is terrible - cut my hand & wrecked a brush trying to open this, no instructions for easy opening on package. Might have to buy again, but will look for alternate that has better packaging, Claims to be recyclable material, hope they don't mind my blood....
B000GLRREU|5|When I first saw this item I noticed over 1500 reviews with a pretty good rating so I thought....this must be good!     I ordered this item late Tuesday night and it arrived early Thursday morning of the same week - yeah Amazon shipping! Right of of the box you get 1) water pik 2) All the different variety of waterpik tips (plaque seeker, tongue cleaner, orthodontic tip, classic, toothbrush).    I first filled the water reservoir and plugged the unit in. I \\"primed\\" the unit and was ready to go. Using this thing definitely does not make you look sexy. :oP I put the waterpik tip in and my mouth quickly filled with water, even though I had my mouth just partially open as instructed to let the water flow out. Water does not flow out of your mouth like the picture (a nice thin downward stream). Water was flowing down everything! Keep your hair up girls! Sometimes I would move the waterpik and the waterpik would shoot water out onto the counter - so just make sure you keep your lips relatively closed enough. I did this three times by accident. :o/    I started on power level 1, but it honestly didn't feel like enough pressure. I felt like I was just dripping water on my teeth. Eventually, I worked up to a 6. I didn't go any higher because I feared soaking my entire bathroom and/or drowning myself with water.    Apparently, my dentist said that you also need to floss and not only use the waterpik, but I guess for people who don't floss anyway...this is a good alternative.    There were studies done (sponsored by the waterpik company but studies had full disclosure) that showed that the waterpik removed biofilm from the teeth. And after I started using this thing I went to the dentist and she did the \\"probing\\" thing to measure the strength of the gums and she said, wow you have really healthy gums. Do you floss? I rarely do, she said it is genetic AND that the waterpik must be helping. She said she loves the waterpik.
B00HFQQ0VU|4|It does a good job.  I rated 4 because it is difficult to use off and on button on the Pik handle.
B00L2MFLPO|5|The quality is very good.<br /><br />I think the biggest advantage is mild to the skin.
B004URZADG|5|these work great. I'll be buying new ones soon had them about a year now
B00VZ90HR6|5|Wonderful lotion, has a really nice smell and I like the results from the lotion. Very moisturizing!!!
B00GTC1JVM|4|I would like to meet an Axe marketer one day just to see how he or she comes up with what they put on their packaging.  Their latest product is “Harmony” (whatever that means) which claims to be “body-calming.”  And of course on the back it suggests that this shower gel will make “you feel the balance to impress girls with your sense of inner peace.”  Alrighty.  Though it is debatable if my luck with the ladies increased after using Harmony, I definitely became cleaner afterwards. The scent itself is pleasant, subtle, and not overwhelming even if it did not leave me more harmonious; exactly what I expected from Axe, a solid product with an absurd marketing plan behind it.
B0055QF95U|1|burnt out before I even have a chance to dip it into my ink.... 2 (TWO) machines on the same tattoo attempt
B0052BHMOO|5|Able to thoroughly dry my natural hair and keep the curls. The cool setting and the diffuser works wonders on my hair. I'm glad I purchased this dryer, it's a good one. The color is nice too.
B00CRIT2UM|4|Very good  stuff  thank
B0047TGS5G|3|I really like the assortment of colors, but there are very few that are actually useable (browns, tans, golds, other neutrals). Unless you're into clown makeup, or you're one of the ten people on this planet that can magically pull off rainbow eyeshadow, this probably isn't the best choice. The blacks and browns are pretty good though, I use them often with my Naked 2 palette.
B0081DRLXC|3|I bought this as a present for my husband and he still did not complain so i think it's a ok product.
B000P20V0M|5|My son chose this cologne for my birthday a couple of years ago. I absolutely love love love the fragrance, but the last three bottles I've ordered from Amazon.com had faulty atomizers. The first I thought was damaged in shipping. Next two were even worse. I love the cologne so much I just suffered with the dripping. And now I'm ordering again. I'll order a different size and hope the atomizer works!
B004UKSKCQ|1|This looks like a great product, but it really isn't. It can supposedly trim beards to any length (it can't), trim 3 day stubble (it can't), do a clean shave (it can't) and trim details and edges (it can, but badly). It hardly catches any of the hairs on my face when doing a clean shave, and catches none of them with any comb attachment on.<br /><br />After a few weeks of trying to get this to work for me, I gave up, replaced it and will try and return it or if not bin it.
B00BQ76XK2|5|love these
B00C3MP4RM|3|It does work. Wish it was a lil bit more powerful and had choice of files. They are too soft for me.
B00AAIVURE|2|It's true - the formula has changed (as noted on the source seller's website).  This does have a clear consistency, and it's aloe like.  The old formula was a bit orange / brown and thinner - and absorbed better.  I don't care so much about the formula, but rather the results.  I have to say, this is just not delivering the results of the old formula.  This is simple doing nothing.  Whereas the old version, brightened my skin, faded dark spots, plumped me up, gave me a healthy even skin tone.  This does...well, nothing.
B004TGUKG0|5|Good
B00BZEWOYU|5|Great quality bath mitt.  suds up nicely with a small amount<br />of soap.  Is a firm scrub mitt without being too abrasive. It also<br />air dries quickly after use.
B000GLRREU|5|This waterpik is a great way to get ALL of the material out of your mouth,and it only takes a few seconds to get the job done.
B002XQ1SF0|4|Smells good but seems to be gone by the end of the day so do I need to pay for the real perfume
B001FB5IIW|5|Great moisturizer all year long.
B0067SCU84|5|Versatile hair conditioner, you can use this as a quick conditioner, or leave it on for a deeper conditioner, very surprised!
B0039VOSPU|5|I like the low keyed smell!
B00KVAEJ92|5|Work well for picking up stones. Wish it sharpened  better
B001GF7W0Y|3|I absolutely adore this color. It's the best color ever. It only gets 3 stars because even with a basecoat and topcoat it seems to last only 2 days before it's chipped.
B00CCYORVA|5|This is the best lotion- smells nice and keeps the skin very moist.
B000OZF8W6|1|I was 34 weeks pregnant when I ordered this oil. Throughout my pregnancy I have been rotating different oils & lotions to make sure my belly stayed stretch mark free, which it was until I started using this product! I noticed as soon as I started it that the skin on my stomach was so dry it was flaky. I would usually shower before using it morning and night (just to make sure it got absorbed well) and then would do an additional application around noon, but it was still drying out my skin. As soon as I realized there was no way this stuff was going to work (I gave it about 3 weeks) I went to the grocery store and bought Bio Oil. Bio Oil is AMAZING - get that, not this!! The first time I got out of the shower to put on the Bio Oil, I noticed new stretch marks and I was completely devastated. No more marks since I stopped using Mama Mio - I wish I had never used it to begin with.
B00GI0W27U|5|You can't find this stuff in the stores anymore!<br />I have found that I just cannot use any other hand lotion...they all smell horrible and I end up having to wash off the lotion just to get rid of the oppressive, cloying scent. Plus, this lotion is not greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin. I will be sad when the NOS is depleted!
B00ODJAMKW|5|ver good.  thank you..  ep
B005LXMEPA|1|The gel hold is what you would expect from any similar product. But the scent of this gel is awful and you will need another product just to mask the stench from using this on your hair.
B000N2J85S|5|I have used Evian spray for over 10 years and it never disappoints! It's refreshing and a great 'wake me up' mornings and afternoon slumps at work.  Especially great during summer's hot, hot days!
B002OE5WYO|1|I've always used Braun epilators before but when I moved to the States I couldn't find one in the first supermarket, so went for this one instead. It was the worst idea. The first time I used it on my underarms, the skin got caught in. It is a design flaw, this never happened to me before, and I am careful and know I have to hold my skin taut. Due to the same design flaw, a lot of hair gets caught in the same space after use, and it becomes impossible to clean. I also feel like it rips hair much more than my other epilator used to.
B0000Y8H3S|5|Been using Rogaine extra strength for almost 10 years. Great product. Do not go with any generic...would you trust your hair loss issue with a generic? Go with the real deal from Amazon and get it to your door step in 2 days with Prime!
B00JITDVCI|5|Great razor at a fair price
B008K82JT4|5|Very satisfied.
B00GGXFJ7O|3|My first one worked when it wanted. Even though I changed the batteries,it quit altogether. I ordered a new one and so far so good.
B002LFLPG0|4|I am very happy I got this lipstick, it has a nice pink color and spreads beautifully, will highly recommend
B00LNOV8JO|3|nothing so far but I will continue to use it as it takes time as with all products.
B0015WJS0K|4|As expected. Taste is okay. Hoping it will help my bad gums. Will update after my next dental visit.
B00815V69A|5|Great set!  Love all the Burberry scents and this is a nice combo when you want to change things up.  Couldn't find it in the stores only on Amazon.
B001B9RGVU|5|Of all the sunscreens I've ever tried, this is my favorite, by far.  I use it daily as I do frequent chemical peels.  I actually find it evens out my skin tone, a bit like a foundation primer.  It does lighten slightly, but not noticeably to others, and I think it does so prettily.  Brightens.  I love that it has neither the signature smell nor the stickiness of every other sunblock I've tried.  I tend to get blackheads, so I've paid close attention to it's effect in that respect and if anything, it's helped.  It's just moisturizing enough to go without using another moisturizer in the winter, but not so much as to be annoying in the summer.  So great.  Do try to keep it out of your hairline, however, as it will make your hair stiff.  Love it.  Couldn't be happier (unless it were cheaper).
B007152J10|5|Omg love this I literally just got this not even 20 min ago and I had to try it rite away I'm a big person when it comes to mascara and normally I have to put so many coats on just so they will look thick and curly not with this I'm so in love  with this product definitely ordering. More
B00JTY6WQ4|5|Oh my gush...LOVE IT!<br />I have no issues with needles but I know there are those out there that get uncomfortable at just the sight of them...If you happen to be one of these people, look away!<br />This product initially 'hurts'...lets face it- its a series of needles rolling on your face...that being said, little- no pressure need be applied to get results.  I like to use my tool after a nice hot shower (pores open) then I apply my vitamin C serum.  After the initial pass on my cheeks, I noticed the blood flow under my skin- it looks like the mark one would have after a scratch or a slap.  It quickly subsides and disappears within 1-2 minutes.<br />I love it!  My skin feels great...My scaring has subsided...Pores look smaller...<br /><br />Only positive results here.  ENJOY!
B00563K6VO|5|I was thrilled to find this flat iron at a very reasonable price, as some of them cost well over $100.  It works great and gets the job done.
B001P4UUV4|5|I am so happy with my my Apricot Scrub. First used this when I was in the Middle East and I couldn't stop using until now. It confuses me though this item to [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St Ives Blemish Blackhead Control]] They are the same but this one is quite pricey for almost $7 while the other one is $2.99. I hope its the quantity but it doesn't look like it.
B000WOYH0S|4|Nice and moisturizing.
B001MJSAJQ|5|I purchased the 60 pack of miscellaneous blades.  I'm apparently unlike many double edged users.  I use a blade until it refuses to provide a decent shave.  That means, I use a blade for at least 10 shaves, some for a full month.  There were better blades in this package, blades at four times the price.  This blade, however, proved to be the best of the affordable ones.  It has become my regular double edge as I find it senseless to spend 50 cents for one shave.  I personally find it silly to pay 50 cents for even ten shaves especially when I get such a good cut with one for 8 cents.  My beard is very heavy and grows quickly.  With this razor, I get a close shave that removes all trace of a whisker.  It does so without the cut or scratches that other inexpensive blades leave.  I will admit, that after the third or fourth shave, the sensation of no whisker to the touch disappears. However, even after a month of shaving, this blade provides a better, smoother shave than any Gillette or Schick.  For the money, that's good enough for me.  I did mention it cuts less than the other low priced brands.  I forgot to say, though, that I personally think it cuts less than most higher priced ones also.  This review was for the ST301.
B007TLGZO8|5|Dense firm bristles. Love the ergonomic handle. Nice quality. Difficult to use for a novice like me. With more practice I don't doubt this will become a favorite for me.
B0053ZK5TI|5|If you're planning on doing your own nails at home, this is a great product. I've been doing my wives nails for over a year now and she is still happy with her nails and still gets lots of &#34; where do you get you nails done&#34;. That says a lot. Good fan and reliable lights.
B00YI1FBJM|4|Very lightweight, nongreasy.  I have extremely sensitive skin and am very picky about what I put on it, but this caused no burning or redness to my face.  I applied it first thing in the morning, did not reapply, and still did not get burned.
B009DQDH3O|5|Excellent on my thick natural wavy hair. Makes blow drying much easier.
B004HYRH06|4|Pretty good. It's just so impossible to get off when you're done.
B000H6DOUU|5|I love the smell of vanilla and this French Vanilla hairspray smells great. I use it to control the frizziness in my hair and after I've flattened my bob. At first I thought the scent was really light, but later I was pleased to find I could still smell vanilla in my hair. This is a nice item for kids and adults. Wonderful.
B00AJFAKEC|5|We received a sample of Tom's of Maine wicked cool toothpaste from a mission on Smiley and my little girl was very surprised with how great the flavor is!!  She said the minty taste was just right. This was coming from a girl who begs me not to buy minty flavored toothpaste!!  So we have found a new favorite toothpaste!!<br /><br /> \\"I received a free sample of Tom's of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\"
B0065DJKRU|5|Love this oatmeal bath. It cured a rash within one day. Woke up with a rash, took an oatmeal bath put on some salve and the rash was gone by bedtime! Although, if you are able, this would be very easy to make at home. Otherwise I recommend this to anyone with babes in diapers.
B005GWTOPE|1|I'll update this review after I try the mask, so far it's about packaging.<br />I bought a pack of 3, planning to gift 2 of them. They were wrapped together by the wide scotch tape which, when removed, took all instructions with it.<br />Who could even come up with the idea of attaching a sticky tape all over the paper label on the jar??? Not a deep thinker obviously...<br />Can't gift them now.
B004Z209HS|5|Fantastic price for a 4oz bottle. I was looking for a substitute for Josie Maran's Argan oil, which is much too expensive.<br />It's fantastic for a nighttime moisturizer, and my acne (I have combination skin) has definitely gotten better. When I'm tired, I put some of the oil under and around my eyes to prevent bags and lines. I also tend to put some on my lips, but then cover that with chapstick in order to seal the oil in.<br /><br />The one downside is not with the oil itself, but the packaging. I don't mind the simple labels at all, but I'm not a big fan of the pump, which tends to dispense more than I need. With argan oil, a little goes a long way. I prefer Josie Maran's dropper, but I also know argan oil can go bad if exposed to oxygen too much.<br /><br />Overall, great product for a great price. Would definitely buy again.
B001SAUBOQ|5|Love this lotion- it is natural and goes on without streaking.  Provides a great glow without too much fuss. Would highly recommend!
B00U8N7NGI|5|Everything fine
B0035FVKI8|4|Much better than anything else I have tried.  Another plus is that they stay in place very well if you apply to a very dry skin surface.  Will definitely purchase again.
B001WAKI2W|5|I have always liked and trusted the colgate brand.  When I received a sample from my dentist I found that after only about a week it reduced the sensitivity in my teeth and I like the idea of protecting the enamel surface at the same time.  When I could not find it in my local store it was Amazon to the rescue.  Great product!
B000F6NXJY|5|I have been using Lancome's eyelash primer for the last year and I am finally out. I decided to try some of the drugstore brands and this works exactly the same as the Lancome. Even if the mascara dries out it's still worth it because it's half the price of the Lancome with the SAME amount of primer in it. I'm happy with it. I did notice that the primer end almost seemed dry to me because I couldn't see it, but when you rub the brush on your fingers they comeoff slightly wet. This is less white than the Lancome so it's harder to see, but when you put the mascara on it is very apparent on the lashes. Oh, I did not buy this on amazon.
B0046KL5CW|5|Makes my hair feel great
B007PN22NI|5|My wife has been giving me my cuts for years and better than any barber Ive had. This Conair handles my thick coarse hair with aplomb. It never comes close to running out of battery charge and my wife loves it because it makes the job easier and quicker. The build is solid and easily handled.
B00ISW8ZVS|1|Well, this did not work for me.  It is awkward to use and does not product the curl that is promised.  Stick to hot rollers if you are looking for curl.
B002CMLHEC|5|Pump its contents with about eight dabs onto your head of hair after a shower, and then comb it in so it spreads.  As it drys to holds your hair in place naturally, with no notice anything was ever added like one finds with hair sprays.  If your hair gets messed up, just run a dampened comb through it.  It's not a product that holds your hair in place as your drive around in your car with the windows open.  But when you get to where you're going, just run a damp comb through your hair to return to a natural look.  And if you leave it in, you'll notice your pillow doesn't show any stains.
B000QYHBZC|5|This is great concealer. After using it, I am going to do what many others do and purchase Beige in addition to Light so I can mix them. I have reasonably fair skin and Light is -very- light, probably best for winter. So if I mix in Beige, it should match. Apply only a tiny bit--I use a concealer brush, then apply foundation to the rest of my face and brush that in over the concealer.  It STAYS--no creasing, no irritation, nice and 'slippery' vs. cakey. By combining Light and Beige, along with having to apply very little, this should last me a very long time.
B00008NG64|1|does not cut. even a little bit for me. i tried pressing really hard and nothing.  i bought another brand for 30 dollars at wallmart and its the round blade type and it cuts but it hurts and feels like it pulls my hair out. and it really doesn't cut that well at all, it leaves spots. i don't know if my bad experence is because i have only tried cheap automatic shavers or what, but they suck :)
B000GCWMSK|5|I heard about Wildroot Cream Oil on a vintage radio program.  It was popular in the 50s (I'll bet my dad used it!) and advertised for the whole family.  Something about the barbershop quartet singing, \\"Try Wildroot Cream Oil ---  CHAR-lie!\\" over and over again apparently got into my brain, because when I cut my hair very short recently I was really curious to try it.  Very glad to see Amazon had it, and very pleased with the soft styling that just a tiny amount will achieve.  No more stiff mousse or gel for me.  The bottle arrived quickly and will last me a long time.
B00GMOB73M|5|This brush is everything it says it is! I have longer, thick, wavy hair and it works great for brushing it out wet or dry.
B00OVG34ZC|5|I am pleasantly surprised about Castor Oil. I have tried many things for dry skin, but this seems to even have a residual effect. I am using it on my face, lashes and brows ... so far, so good!
B001E5EDJY|1|\\"Natural Medium Golden Brown??\\"  Try it turned my naturally medium brown hair fiery red!  My husband was getting choked out by the smell (as was I) and asked why it smelled that bad.  When I washed it out, it looked okay then I turned a cool hair dryer on it and the drier it got, the more horrified I became.  The roots especially were bright, brassy red and the texture of my hair was completely fried.  (Yes, I followed the directions to a tee)  A week later, I used a creme hair color in an effort to not be so harsh on my already fragile hair and it covered the majority of it but the roots were still RED.  It took me using Argan oil for 3 weeks to get my hair to not crunch.  It's been 3 months and I used Olia by Garnier which uses no ammonia to hopefully cover the remaining red.  No dice.  The rest of the hair looks great (and isn't crunchy and dead) but the roots, which I heavily concentrated on are still red.  My hair doesn't grow fast so I guess I'm stuck with what Clairol did to my hair.  Colorer beware!
B000XFW1D6|5|Love it!!!
B002D4EBGU|5|Does what it is suppose to do.  Much less expensive to get it this way compared to dealing with a local shop.
B0000532RG|5|I have pretty sensitive skin.  I've been able to use other deodorants and anti-perspirants in the past, but have always had to stop using them after a few months because they would cause a rash.  I've been using deodorants from Tom's of Maine for a couple of years and haven't had to switch.  The honeysuckle rose scent is nice, not too heavy or cloying.  (I've tried some deodorants that had such a thick scent that it clashed with my perfume!)  The deodorant goes on easily and lasts all day.  I'm very pleased with it.
B003YJ9YBU|5|Amazing cleanser! I've had horrible skin from day one. Thousands of dollars spent trying to find something that targets all areas.<br />Jan Marini products are the best thus far.
B003Q33DP2|5|OMG U NEED THIS POLISH IN UR COLLECTION IF YOU LOVE POLISH! The color is a dark purple with a beautiful halo! It took one coat to get full cover.I'm in love and the shipping was fast! Thank u! :)
B00J3XPYWE|1|Polish was very thick and impossible to apply evenly.  I have used OPI gel polish for over a year and have never had this problem.  The colors are very sheer which is why I bought them.  Not sure if the polish was defective or old.  Returned to seller who claimed they could not be old as they just debuted.  Not true.  They have been out for over a year.
B000FQMMSC|5|I've ordered these salts in both Blue and White, and I love them both! They both smell very pleasant, and the change to the bath color is fun. Even my partner likes the Blue one. I will certainly make these a regular buy.
B0019W29DO|5|I have purchased this product a few times and it's worth the purchase price.<br />it's a temporary way to enhance your complexion to look more relaxed.  Doesn't really remove wrinkles, but it gives the complexion a more smooth, relax look for several hours.
B0056GDG90|1|The thing that irritates me the most about this product is that my ability to return it just expired.  It does not work at all, it is easily the most useless hair styling product I have ever bought in my life.  I would be less angry if I got my money back, but now I just have an ugly paper weight on my hands.  DO NOT BUY.
B0085RZKRI|5|Like the sonicare products very much.  Helps to keep my teeth and gums healthy.
B0007L8324|5|I love this hair gel.  I originally had picked up only a small travel size from our local retailer.  I was impressed with the quality of this gel, as was my wife, so I ordered two 9 oz tubes from Amazon.  The TRESemme gel controls my hair well without leaving behind any hard or sticky residue, and hair still soft to the touch and easy to comb after application dries.  I use only a small dab of gel which spreads well throughout my short hair.  This gel also has one of the most attractive scents of any gel I have ever used.  Wish they offered a bigger size, though, as my wife also uses.  Glad I purchased the second tube.  Highly recommended for both men and women.
B00B8KD06M|5|The wig is absolutely beautiful and fits the description very well. The material is very realistic, soft, and well made. Your real hair never shows through and it's comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend this wig.
B00GLP7254|5|I have used this product for some time and really like it!!!
B007SDGMOA|5|muy exquisito y la presentación es fenomenal, lo recomiendo para toda ocasion 100% recomendado tanto para dama como caballero de seguro le va a gustar
B000X9N4AQ|5|Ordered this for some other folks who swear by it.  They say it is the greatest deodorant out there.
B001JQLNVE|5|Been using this for a while and it is hard to find in this scent.
B00D8VXDMU|5|I love this sunscreen.  It wears well under makeup without adding shine and I don't get that oily look as the day progresses.  It also has antioxidants so I think it's an excellent product!
B000B969B4|5|Awesome thing, no more use simple deodorants with chemicals.
B00E9PPGTM|3|I tried both the &#34;Slim Soft Pro Tip&#34; Toothbrush and the &#34;Slim Soft Gliding Tips&#34; Toothbrush. They both have Very Soft bristles ideal sensitive teeth and gums - if you brush with force you defeat the purpose of the soft bristle. Just go with it and enjoy getting your teeth very tidy between flossing in the hard to reach areas your electric toothbrush might not get as easily.  I use my electric toothbrush in the morning and this toothbrush at night - works perfect with Colgate toothpaste whitening.<br /><br />ONLY the PRO TIP has the raised tip (in blue) for easier access to back teeth.<br />They both have Floss-Tip bristles for a closer deeper clean at the gum line and between the teeth<br />They both have 17X Slimmer Bristles for a finer, closer Clean<br />They both have high density number of bristles
B004AI7NXA|5|Great value.
B003HEHZKY|5|Everything was as stated in ad, got the conditioner fast, packaged well, works excellent! This is a good Service! Thanks!
B00JJ4JSC4|5|Great product
B0015IXM4C|3|I liked the slickness and cushion of the lather but the smell was overpowering. If only they made a version with a different smell or at least used less of the almond smell I would have given it a higher rating.
B004HGTTHI|1|Extremely difficult to squeeze bottle and get product out.  Will not buy again.
B006ND9ZOK|4|Absorbs quickly and makes your skin soft, but the best part was the price. It is over $20 in ulta and here I payed about $12.
B004D2DPNK|5|Most of these reviews were for the fragrance-free, but I got the light fragrance version because it was cheaper for me at the the time I was ordering, so I'll review that instead.<br /><br />It's a men's lotion, so obviously, the smell isn't going to be flowery or whatever. It's one of those 'manly' scents. Really hard to describe exactly what it smells like, but ladies have commented that it smelled nice, so that means, at the very least, it doesn't smell bad. It is a really light fragrance, so it's not like one of those obnoxious perfumes which pollute an entire room. Only you or someone really close to you can smell it, and after ~5 minutes, you can't smell anything unless you hold your hand or whatever body part you applied the lotion to up to your nose.<br /><br />As for the lotion itself, I really like it because it works really well. It's non-greasy, absorbs in like a couple of minutes, and just feels really good. It says it's a body face and post-shave lotion, but some of the reviewers have said that they were too scared to apply it to their face. Well, I wasn't too scared, and I can tell you that it works perfectly fine on the face. No acne breakouts or anything. Gives off a soothing feeling if you apply it after a shave.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking for a versatile lotion, this is a great choice. Whether you get the light-fragrance or the no fragrance is up to you: both are fine in my opinion.
B0023GAIGK|1|I have eczema on my hands and have bought Amantle cream for the past several years and it worked great! When the price jumped from $92/1 lb. to $150/LB. I decided to try this Risabal cream....it claims to have the same active ingredient that the Amantle cream had that made it work.....well, it does NOT. Do not be fooled into buying this product....it is NO better than regular hand cream that you buy at the store.......at least for my dry skin. Sometimes I have to reapply it every 5 minutes.  I refuse to pay $150 for a hand cream.....that was a %50 increase!
B0009OAGK6|5|You can't go wrong with this classic
B005RU0RZ6|5|I  love this product 100%. I'm 1yr into transitioning to natural and  It gives my hair shine, soft texture, define curls,everything I always wanted my hair to feel and look like. I'm not crazy for the smell but it delivers and i love it! The price is reasonable. This my main product for styling and i can't wait til my hair become even longer. :) Just LOVE IT
B004G88QDU|5|My husband and I bought some of this on our honeymoon and this scent instantly takes us back there. It's very masculine without being overpowering. We were sure to buy extra bottles but I don't think we'll need them for some time as two and a half years later he still has the original.
B005XUNG5I|4|Love it.
B0009DT39C|5|I bought this to trim the low hairline on my neck between visits to the salon. It is easy to use on your self and the rotating head stays close to the skin. Another review thought it was great for facial hair but I did not find it was a close enough shave to my liking. It is compact and has a protective cover for storing or traveling.
B000C1Z3LS|5|Wife loved it!
B000OYJ8UU|5|If you haven't tried HEMPZ herbal skin care, you don't know what you're missing.  Its unabashedly the best skin cream ever.<br />Feels like silk, not greasy.  Softens skin on contact.
B00021B4S4|5|Perfect for summer. Not really flowery, its more of fresh watery scent.Just one whiff makes you think of ocean and clean air.  Fragrances this light usually dissappear in no time but this one has staying power which is a big plus in my book. I'm definately adding this one to my fragrance wardrobe.
B00JFHPTVY|4|Very nice light weight. This is the second set I have purchased. I like them because I can look over the frame and see the TV and then look back down to continue to read.
B003B6QMDO|2|If I'd had the chance to read the fine print on the box, wouldn't have bought it. The &#34;Before use&#34; contradicts the safety warnings &#34;if on skin... Rinse skin immediately... Call Poison Control...&#34; why would I then stick my feet into a tub of water with these tablets?
B001KYQ374|1|This is possibly the MOST horrible eyeliner I've ever used.<br /><br />#1:  The brush looks NOTHING like it is pictured on the outside of the box.  On top of this, it is possibly the hardest, most uncomfortable applicator I've ever encountered.  Pencils aren't even this hard.<br /><br />#2:  I applied my make up this morning at 6 AM, by 7:15 I had a black arc along the top of my lid.  I have never had any other eyeliner do this (both waterproof and regular).  When I went to try to wash it off, I ended up literally scraping it off with a paper towel, I had to do this again at 10 AM.  When I went home for lunch, I decided that I would just try to take it off with eye make up remover.  The same stuff I have used with several other waterproof brands (that did NOT smear on my skin) that works perfectly.  After 10 minutes, a torn contact, and extremely red eyes, I gave up.  It had not moved.  I finally tried slathering my eyelids with night time moisturizer before this would even begin to budge.  It took 3 very thick coats and wiping if off in between.<br /><br />This is the first AND LAST time I will use this product.  Please beware.  It's terrible.
B00065IBKK|4|Pretty good product. Comes with many sized combs. Easy to use for a first timer like me. Worth every penny.
B00GR4TPW2|5|Nice colors and good dupe.
B00CYW5QD8|1|Did not get what was pictured. It was a solid brown color. The tools are great but was real disappointed the specific design was what I got.
B0009953IQ|1|This fogs up right away.... and has spots embedded in the image.... I even bought an anti fog spray hoping this would cure the issue.  it did not. On paper this is exactly what I needed..... in reality it had no value.
B000Q5PHN4|3|The appearance of the wig is pretty good.  Actually it exceeded my expectations as far as quality.   Loved the accessories that came with the wig.  Definitely a bargain.  Unfortunately, it is near impossible to maintain and keep untangled.  My daughter loves it anyway.
B003STU190|4|Great lotion!
B0017RC42W|4|Got this for my husband after the one he had got beyond cleaning. He likes it better than his old brush.
B008FXFH66|5|Great little portable gel nail dryer. Works wonderfully. Would purchase again.
B00E7LFHYW|5|exelent
B003TBYW74|5|i love it
B00HFCHJ14|5|I have used several removers over the last 26 years.  This is the best product I have ever used.  I can remove adesive without the need to wash which is great when you are on vacation.
B00AELX08E|4|It will definitely dry your hair. There was some very heated spots near my ears, but that is a fault of my own as I'm still learning to roll and clip my hair. I have very long hair and use large rollers. This causes the dryer cap not to be fully tightened around face. Worth the money and will do same job as higher priced dryers.
B0046KFZC8|5|Works great, even on my blue hair!
B00385WMK0|5|This mat is really great to have.  Simply place your hot curling iron(s) or heated hair products and this mat and walk away.  Your furniture will thank you.
B00DG1A2OY|4|Just the smell will win you over.<br /> Makes my face feel smooth and gives it a healthy look. Great find.
B008BFUD9O|5|Its light and easy to work with more control much better for tattooing neat and not as heavy as the normal tattoo gun
B0091Q10M6|3|The wig is actually surprisingly good considering how much it's being sold for.<br />Pros- Looks like real hair, it's comfortable, and it's a really good length.<br />Cons- Tangles bad, like really really really bad. Some of the lace sticks out in the back but can be easily covered. The wig is a little bit too thin too but hey it's cheap.<br />It's an OK wig, really fun to wear, and the only real downside is the tangling. All in all it's a cheap wig that's actually not that cheap looking.
B00FAEYJL2|5|I used to buy this fragrance at Bath & Body Works but they quit selling it a long time ago, I was so happy to find it on Amazon! This fragrance is wonderful so clean and fresh smelling.
B003FBRU9U|1|Terrible!!! Obviously the product is old not color at all comes out, I shoukd have expected that for the price, you get what you pay for.
B0001436S8|3|The packaging was awful,and the writing on the bottle was damaged.  The UPC code has been rubbed off.  It doesn't affect the product which I like, but, I will not buy from this seller again.  This product is for oily hair.  It leaves my hair too dry if I use it everyday.
B00AHHHM5M|3|Here's the deal, does it hold makeup well?  Yes.  There might not be a place for your longer brushes except for in the bottom.  When it expands, it takes up a large footprint.  I don't mind that so much.  However, it comes with a strap and quite literally the very first time I was putting it onto kit, the plastic broke rendering it completely useless.  If you're going to use a strap to haul it around, I would think twice about this purchase.  Otherwise, it's just ok.
B002HREX5W|1|the cartridges do not fit my mangroomer, so i bought a new mangroomer and they dont fit that one either.
B00I3VHKVK|5|Got for my Mum, she loves the brushes!
B000W7K98E|5|This conditioner is the only one that gets the tangles out of my hair.  My hair is long and thick
B0011EN3FS|5|I was introduced to this cream at my derm's office but they no longer carry it.  $35 is a great price for this wonderfully rich treat when my face feels a little dry.  I actually use it every night after applying Retin A.    CAUTION:  A little goes a long way, so if you use too much, you will feel \\"sticky.\\"
B00CBFBMM2|4|Bought this for my husband who has been using it for several years and loves it!
B007HOCQVS|5|I love this stuff! I've been using this for about the past two months now and I've seen a difference in how much hair I shed. My drain doesn't get clogged anymore and I have less shed hair in my brush. I am a natural curly African American woman and I can say with pride I'm officially a Wen girl! Detangling my hair is a breeze and my curls pop and my hair is shiny whenever I wear my hair curly. But the real miracle came when I straightened my hair. Normally it takes me 3 hours for me to straighten my curly hair, now it only takes me an hour and a half! I even noticed a difference in my hair when I went back to my regular condish when I was running out of my Wen. It's softer, shiner, more definition, and the tangles melt away. With my straight hair, it has movement and I don't have to blowdry my hair forever. If anyone wants to know if it works for black, natural hair, I'm here to tell you, it's the truth!
B000V9EDV2|5|It is hands down the greatest foundation you can buy! Believe me when I say it is undetectable in real life. The only catch is if you have very oily skin just keep some powder on hand...OR!...do what I do and powder before you put on this foundation. I swear it keeps you matte. I adore this foundation!
B00BNM8RK4|5|Really beautiful.  I love it
B00EUT7D5M|5|Love these
B00FZ29ICO|5|The shape and design is wonderful. I call it my flying saucer mister. It works great. I recommend it to anyone. Worth the money, it's small and easy to use.
B001J6O0PU|4|What can I say, It replaced the original screen and blade. Works well.
B004MLXQ54|4|The pumps arrived packaged nice and small... the color did not appear as in photo;( They're more of a pearl beige color, not at all white. They still seem to function so I think I can be happy despite the misrepresentation.
B0041QOU8W|3|not so good
B00G552F8Y|4|They look just like the picture. The colors are brilliant, the only reason I did not give it a love is because the back is not a curved flat surface. It is a  curved bumpy surface so sometimes you have to apply glue twice to get the proper strength to be sure it will stay on for extended periods of time.
B00GU1FM42|5|Beautiful!!!! Love Incoco
B00GOJMIWO|5|This Hair Brush truly works....Thanks my Grands love it . Will be purchasing more for my friends<br />and I will be sharing the news about this brush
B00B1LQTLG|5|I was so excited when these arrived as quickly as they did. I had never heard of this company before and wasn't sure what to expect since the samples were only a dollar. I opened to find my three eyeshadow samples, a shipping slip, and bonus sample of eye shadow primer in a cute little mesh bag. I immediately swatched them both with and without the primer and was blown away by the pigmentation. They were such beautiful colors too.  I will definitely be ordering more products from them in the future.
B00ARF42H0|5|Excellent product
B006H9LBFQ|1|I instantly disliked this product as a facial shave product.  It's like rubbing toothepaste on your face.  It lathers poorly if you put it in a shaving cup and churn it with your brush.  It's not slick enough on your face and give a scrapy shave.  Smells like toothepaste also.  This product might work well for women to shave their legs, etc., but as a facial shave cream it bombs.  I gave it a try, out of curiosity, but would never repurchase it.
B0097DN1XE|3|I thought it would be a red but it came out like brownish red. Still very pretty but not the color portrayed here. But thank you :)
B001LNWX1O|5|They are perfect, and actually nice quality! Better than what I would buy at CVS, Walgreens, or Target.. and cheaper too. :)
B00336EUTK|5|I have used Crest white strips for ten years now, people don't even ask what I want for gifts because they already know. It had been about a year since I did a full box, I usually use one strip every week or so, and I started noticing some serious yellowing. Then that commercial got in my head and I was literally walking around thinking, &#34;if you're not whitening....&#34;<br /><br />Anyway I ordered these and they are just what I expected but better because the strips grip your teeth like never before. The solution bubbles up and tingles a little but I have not had any sensitivity. I use one or two at a time, and don't use them every day. It will probably take me a month and a half to use this box up.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Crest White Strips!
B00B2IIXRG|4|Good, classic vanilla scent. Not too overpowering, and staying power is not the greatest, but it is good layered over other vanilla fragrances or lotions to intensify or prolong the vanilla scent.
B00M518IX8|5|Very bright, pretty colors, & came before the estimated date. Very pleased :)
B000RGWQ3G|5|I was given a bottle of this cream after my surgery when I got my pacemaker implanted. After the pain of the cut went away, I was stuck with the glue and the stitches(the ones inside the body.They don't show.) The cut was very itchy and of course I couldn't scratch. This product worked very well do sooth my skin so I could get some sleep as it was mostly at night when I was about to go to sleep that the itchiness was felt.( I guess since I was just laying down and looking at the ceiling and I had nothing else to do, I focused on the cut.) I just found out that this is sold on Amazon. I thought it was one of those \\"hospital\\" creams that you can't really get anywhere else. Although I am not purchasing this product yet, which by the way, I came across it because I'm looking to find a cream that won't irritate my face and make my acne worse, or hopefully get rid of it, I wanted to post this so that anyone who is interested in the product may see the results that someone else has had with it. Sorry I couldn't comment on whether the cream lasts or if it runs out fairly quickly, or if it goes on thick or thin, or if it's oily because I just don't remember. I just remember putting a whole lot of cream on my cut to sooth it. At the time, that's all I cared about. hope this helped :)
B00178RONK|4|I purchased this steamer for my children. Their dermatologist recommended a facial steamer to help with their acne. I wanted one that had an arm and you could rotate and not just put your face into so you could use on various parts of your body.<br />My children, love it and I have seen great results from it on both of them. I highly recommend it. The only issue, I have is this unit did not come with any directions.
B00BSTYBZ2|5|This i feel like is the grown up version of Aqua De Gio, the smell definitely lasts longer the the EDT, give it a try, you will not be disappointed.
B00NHXX8RE|5|Just loved it!
B00L0R5494|3|This is more for non professionals, the colors aren't very pigmented, and sometimes stuff won't come on the brush,  But it could be good for a starting out teenager or beginner in eye makeup.
B00C7DYBX0|4|Works somewhat
B003EH219O|5|Definitely love this conditioner. Works great and leaves my hair feeling healthy and un-tangled. Definitely will be buying this again.
B007MPEG4M|5|This hair was great! It dyes easily and it feels great. It was thick and full. I would definitely buy again.
B005KSZKTI|5|Have tried 4 different scents of Wen.  This by far is my favorite.  It is a little thicker than the original Almond Mint, but less than Pomegranate.  For those who know what true pumpkin spice is with just a hint more clove...this is it.
B006QOE5N2|5|good
B004LBJEU6|3|I thought this was a different neutrogena face wash to the one i am currently using but when i got the product i realized it was the same thing. It has not done anything for me with removing blemishes and i use this product everyday for the past two months. Sometimes it makes my face feels dry but not excessively dry but i still use it nonetheless. I just wish it was able to remove the blemishes i have.
B00A346X5O|3|THE HAIR SHEDS SOOOOO MUCH AND ITS NOT 100 percent HUMAN ITS MIXED WITH OTHERS FIBERS... THAT SUCKS,<br />NOT BUYING AGAIN
B0014TDE5E|5|Miracle 2 soap is a standard in our home. We have been using it for about 10 years now and I cannot imagine our family without it. It is a wonderful and versatile product that we use for not just bathing purposes, but also to prevent mosquitos biting, or once they've bitten we use it to reduce the effects of the bite. it also soothes the bite of sunburns and other skin irritants. AMAZING product we would not be without.
B00RPQ1JYS|5|I bought this rosehip oil to replace a rosehip oil I ordered from somewhere else. The one I ordered from somewhere else said it was pure, but when it arrived the label said it was mixed with vitamin E oil. This one is pure and it has done wonders for my skin. I do mix it with lavender, frankincense, and lemon essential oils. I use this as my carrier oil. Several people have commented on how good my skin looks. I am 44. I highly recommend this product.
B00699J7KK|5|OMG! This is by far one of the BEST smelling tanning lotions I have ever used! I hate how tanning lotions always smell like tanning lotion. This stuff has a nice fruity smell and goes on wonderful. It's  not too greasy feeling. I really love it. I use it along with snooki shimmering body moisturizer.
B008BNRCSQ|5|They worked great and nice price
B006CWSJB2|5|Plan to purchase again.
B00AQ4BLOE|5|I found this product very  good. I am  a cosmetology and I  will  definitely use this  product on my clients.
B000G666QK|3|I have thick, dark eyebrows. I try not to do too much in the ways of plucking or trimming; I pluck strays and sometimes I'll trim a long hair. I shaped my eyebrows to perfection once, and I am basically terrified to try to do anything else to them. I comb them into place and they look great, I don't need to use pencil or powder, but I need something to keep them in place. I have a few unruly hairs that stick out and make me feel like I look unkempt. I've tried cheap drugstore clear mascaras, hairspray, gel, wax...And now this mousse.<br /><br />Here are my findings:<br />*Has a mascara brush applicator<br />*Thin, gel like consistency (much like Maybelline's clear mascara, but even lighter)<br />*I found that it needs to be coaxed out of the tube the first couple of uses<br />*Once dry it makes my eyebrows hard..kind of crunchy. Probably because I use so much of it trying to tame my brow hairs! It's not terrible, just feels a little strange<br />*No fragrance<br />*Does not bother sensitive eyes<br />*Haven't noticed any flaking<br /><br />Overall this product didn't \\"wow\\" me like I was hoping, and I won't be repurchasing. Nothing against the Tweezerman Brow Mousse, it unfortunately just is not what I've been looking for. The search continues!
B000195QCC|5|This eau de parfum its awsome, smells deliciuos, was a gift for my husband and he loves it.... thanks a lot!, all was perfect.
B0002RYHTQ|2|fine cotton gloves but $11 for one pair??? For that price I expected more than one pair even though it didn't say so. WOW!
B006LRKZM4|5|Great price and the oil is exactly as described. Using it in soap making. This company carries a lot of hard to find oils in organic for very good prices.
B000L77BQ8|2|I cant believe i paid 50 dollars for a bottle thats the size of practically of my middle finger. It lasted my sister a week.
B00KCFAZTE|5|Usually around my eyes is very dry and puffy. I am big on sleeping.. I go to bed early and get up early. I am going to be 48 and no one can tell me age. This procudt deflate puffy eyes and the skin around your eyes is soft  and smooth.
B003O2N6T8|5|Love this product.  Great price and it smells wonderful. Would buy again and again.
B003CTVSKC|5|I think this project is great for the hair because it locks In lots of moisture and softness and the smell is great.
B001I6WT1S|5|this lip balm is AMAZING! and tastes amazing too, only issue is it took forever to arrive.
B006L9L2YC|4|I gave this little set as a Christmas present, and it was very well received. Crabtree and Evelyn really doesn't need a review..there products alr always good!
B00GJG9JBA|3|While I generally use Neutrogena's &#34;oil-free moisture for sensitive skin,&#34; occasional forays lead me to try alternatives such as Baxter of California's &#34;oil-free moisturizer&#34; and the topic of this review, which is labeled as &#34;brightening even-tone moisturizing cream.&#34;<br /><br />First, it works well as a facial moisturizer.  It's not greasy and doesn't make your face all shiny.  'nuff said.<br /><br />Second, it has a distinct scent, possibly due to the daisy extract advertised on the label.  While the smell doesn't linger after application, certain consumers might find its presence objectionable, unnecessary or both.<br /><br />Third, the back of the dispenser indicates this about the product: &#34;Clinically proven to visibly even skin tone and help diminish the appearance of dark spots and discoloration, 100% of women say brighter skin after using&#34; it.  At the bottom, though, it reads &#34;after 8 weeks of use.&#34;  After two weeks of use, I certainly didn't notice any dramatic changes in my skin tone.<br /><br />Bottom line: Good product with bold claims.
B0009OAIAE|1|stinks....smells like something an old lady would wear
B003DXG9DI|3|Pretty good! I like it!
B004A436JO|4|I have not been able to find barrettes that would stay tight so that the hair pulled back off of my face would stay in place.  These barrettes did the job.  They are in nice subdued metal colors and provide a polished look in the business world.
B001428ZC8|5|I use this oil several times a week, if not every day. I put some on a square of fabric in my car and fold it into the air conditioning vent to keep road rage to a minimum while I drive the mean streets of San Diego, haha. It works great! I alternate between Chill Pill and Tranquility, which is similar-base of lavender, but with more pine scented undertones- whereas this one is lavender with a more citrusy/orange scent. Both are great for relaxation and calming and I get compliments when I use them at work or in my car. I sometimes carry it in my purse and when I open it to rummage around, the smell wafts out and people ask what that nice smell is. My coworker, who is a Doterra consultant (and swears that any other oil is terrible and made by the devil) always thinks it's one of her overpriced oils, lol, and I just let her believe that to avoid a long spiel about why pyramid scheme oils are better quality and harvested in exclusive fields in exotic locales, whereas mine is made by satanic crackheads in a back alley in Los Angeles.  Anyhow, I do my research and know that this is good oil, so go ahead and give it a go. You can also use this oil on bug bites, bruises, minor scrapes and such and it works wonderfully. I definitely recommend it!
B007UVSTZK|5|I LOVE MAC!  LIPGLASS LAST FOREVER EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS SO SMALL.  IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE CHEAP STUFF YOU GET AT A PHARMACY.
B002PNBZIQ|5|I'd had my eye on this powder for awhile and finally pulled the trigger.  It does not disappoint. I am very fair and although it is dark, it looks very natural (it's creating shadows, afterall).  I'm still experimenting with what brushes to use with it but I'm incredibly happy with it (I use it with the Candlelight powder as well).
B00ESDUWPS|1|I can't believe some people!!! Why not call it vicious Chihuahua attack?? Or vicious German Shepard mauling?? Great way to stereotype a breed of dog that already is feared by many...... Although I don't have any clue why, since they are one of the sweetest dog breeds EVER!!! PATHETIC!!!!
B000JNQSIQ|5|My wife has been cutting my hair for a few years and purchased this kit as the previous clipper was not working as well.  We have been very happy with this kit.  It cuts well and has all of the pieces needed to give great haircuts.  Would highly recommend!
B00LEVZTAA|5|My dental hygienist can't believe how clean my teeth are now. And no cavities!! She is going to recommend to other patients. If you have a lot of tartar and hate all that scraping every visit, get the Sulcabrush.<br />You can use it while watching tv or whatever. Floss (even the expensive kind) tends to stick and shred in my back teeth. The contoured bristles &#34;detail&#34; my teeth daily. Also, it makes my gums more resilient.
B000WUHM9K|5|Works GREAT!!
B004KEU43A|5|I first found this lipstick in a health food store.  They had done a lot of research on the ingredients and found that this brand was superior. I had a bad experience with a long lasting lipstick and am now very particular as many brands contain toxic ingredients.
B0015KHMRS|5|It's a WAHL ...enough said, no really a very good tool for home dressers and hair dressers for cleaning up facial hair and edging buzz cuts.
B00EN1PDE0|1|Yikes! They tear your hair out. Not cool. Getting the glue out of your hair is a nightmare.
B00AEYGIR6|3|I was very excited to learn about this product and was very excited to try my own. Most reviews I read or watched were positive and expressed how moisturizing this product is. While this is true, I find that it bleeds, takes much longer to dry than expressed and transfers more easily than I would have hoped. Over all a good product but I will not repurchase!
B00MP3OP5G|1|Poor quality of material and finishing of  the tools. Lousy designs
B001FWXI6U|5|In past I used 2 different Body Sprays from Adidas and I really liked it and so with this I ordered 5 diff body sprays and 4 different &#34; Eau De Toilette &#34; Spray's as well.I am very happy with this product.
B003EMKNWG|5|I first started using Tom's deodorant which has no aluminum in it (which causes Alzheimer's) I than was looking for a really all natural soap and Toms' came to mind. It is the best natural soap with lavender oil in it. Glad I stuck with Toms' brand.
B0009OMNQ6|5|Love, love , love this stuff. Makes my hair so shiny & it smells SO good!
B00K7AQ264|5|Super cute hair clips.
B002R10JCE|5|I've always heard that cucumber slices really work wonders for puffy eyes.  However, how often do you have a cucumber around when your eyes happen to be puffy and in need of soothing?  These coolers are much easier to keep on hand for when you need them.  You don't have to worry about spoiling or something adding your eye soothers to a salad!
B00112DTT0|5|I am 55 and have liver spots as well as spider angiomas under my skin (little flat red spots) and it covers all of it very well. Very happy with the product.
B003MJG19K|3|Nice product no smell great bottle and has a dropper so you can use as much or as little you want . Caused me breakout but for me its a major issue with all oily products ..ugh sinks right in though ...nice and light oil for those who do not have acne prone skin .For me it didnt work sadly!
B001E6SCP4|5|I have a tin in every bag, at the office, and in my coat pocket!
B002JLMT4S|5|I've tried a lot of high-end salon brands on my naturally curly and color-treated hair. These days I'm on a budget and went looking for an alternative to the much pricier brand I'd been using. I wish I found DevaCare One long ago.<br /><br />It's wonderfully hydrating, and works exceptionally well (as suggested on the bottle) as a leave-in conditioner that you apply just before you get out of the shower. I don't have any frizzies, and I don't need a styling product when I'm done. I can air-dry my hair.<br /><br />Also, if it's important to you that you're not using harmful chemicals on your hair, do some price shopping on sulfate-free products, and you'll find that this is one of the best values you'll find anywhere.<br /><br />The product has a light citrus/orange scent that isn't my favorite, but now that I've been using it for so long, I don't notice anymore.
B000W8WE7M|5|My former hairdresser suggested that I used this product since I was having major hair loss on the top of my head as well as dry, flaky scalp. I received my product on the first estimated date and was too excited to use it. Immediately I greased my scalp with it...a little goes a long way...after a hour or so I felt a tingling and I knew that it was working. The oil is not at all heavy and my hair feel soft. I feel that by the bottom of this jar I will see some serious results. Will update.
B0027A7CLG|3|For me, this bb cream is just so so. it doesnt provide full coverage and the color and product does wear off in a short while. i dont think its the best for combination skin. my favorite is definitely dr jarts silver label, which stays on alot longer and provides full coverage with just some mineral powder on top. this one i just now use on my neck and chest for the spf and blending, but definitely not as good as dr jarts.
B00AYKUW54|5|My husband received a box of this body soap when he put in a water system. He is a diabetic and has very dry skin. He uses nothing but this soap. He was down to his last 2 bars and was sad because he thought I would not be able to locate the company because he had used it so long! I cant't wait to see his face when he opens the box. He has the most beautiful skin I have ever seen on a man. it keeps him hydrated and happy! glad to find you on Amazon !hanks!
B0077ICNNA|5|This are great to use. I don't wear make up a lot unless I have a reason, too. But these are great!! There soft & work great... i will never buy any other brushes again. Only these.
B003LDMVNM|4|I never though putting oil on my face would be a good thing! But this product is definitely a GOOD thing! I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin that even the most basic of skin care products make break out or rash. This oil is excellent to use as an eye make-up remover and night time moisturizer.  It's also excellent to help relieve the sensitive skin around your nose when you have a cold! The only thing I find is that if I use the oil and then put on mascara at times during the the day my mascara will be under my eyes. So I'll stick to using this in the evenings.
B00AEK1IG6|3|It worked all right for the purpose, but the expiration date was very close. It evidenced that the batch was manufactured quit long ago. Normally this kind of hot pads sold at a store have a few years of an expiration date.
B00ET6DD0U|5|Awsome :-)
B00D0ANSAG|3|They seem nice, good quality, and interesting shapes. I tried it with my liquid foundation and also for softening blush. And while they got the job done, I didn't notice any earth shattering results that would cause me to constantly purchase more of these oddly shaped sponges.
B003S516XO|5|Loves this! I don't have to wait for very long for it to get hot. Does the job quick. I'm in and out of the bathroom in no time.
B00PGFZ338|1|It arrived solid as a rock! Unusable.
B007SZ2T3Q|5|Urban decay makes the best eyeshadows hands down. No other brand is as good. I have tried a lot too. Great when used with a primer. The pigment is great and buildable. I recently bought verve and mushroom to be worn together. Verve for all over the eye. Its a pretty pearly white type of color. Mushroom for the crease. Both are shimmery.
B00BKUHJ0S|5|This product is such a cute summer color and I was so excited that I put it on my nails within 20 minutes of picking it up out of my mailbox!
B0080EEMCA|5|very good
B0076OIS7U|5|I have used this product before but have not been able to find it anymore. It really works on those under eye wrinkles.
B005UBN5AQ|4|After reading the reviews, i gave this a try on my husband s amazon account.They came fast, they look good too but i feel they are too many...some of them can be use for the same purpose.I guess with oractise ill use them all.<br />They didnt shed at all so that was what i was looking for.
B001DKMY9Q|5|I've been using Panasonic electric shavers for many years now. The two models that preceded this one were pretty decent shavers, but can't hold a candle to this one. The ES8243A is an outstanding shaver. It appears to be well put together and feels well-balanced in your hands. I usually shave dry. The shave I get out of this is very close, no irritation at all, and I'm usually done in just over a couple of minutes. As another reviewer remarked, the shaver makes a nice \\"satisfying\\" sound as works through your hair :) I'm extremely happy at this point (after a couple of months use).
B00HNSS8X8|3|I had the chance to try out a sample of this foundation, and I was really excited to test it out. But after about a week of use, I'm disappointed overall. First of all, and maybe this is just my bottle, but it's nearly impossible to get out of the bottle. Tapping it on my hand doesn't work, storing upside down doesn't help. Instead, I have to use a mini scoop to get product out. I have combination skin, and my nose and forehead are usually my oily areas. Within three hours, I was oily. I also have broken capillaries in my cheeks, and this did not cover as well as I'd hoped.
B005AN8BZ8|5|as advertised. Great price.
B000O6XFK2|5|This file is fantastic. The concave curve and wide paddle allow for lots of surface contact with your feet.<br /><br />The grit is quite rough, so you might want to consider a medium file or something to finish off, but if your feet are exposed to weather a lot like mine, and you don't want to be grinding every second day then a coarse file saves a lot of time.<br /><br />These products and a little sorbolene moisturiser will transform your feet. A little effort goes a long way toward both appearance and comfort.
B00IKJ20TC|5|Excellent product!
B00G88E9DC|5|Works great, the brush unit is solid and well made, the brush is gentle enough for sensitive skin and the cradle stand (which is the reason why I picked the Burlway model vs the other options on Amazon) is perfect for holding it upright when not in use.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking for an alternative to the Mia.
B00DFQNP80|5|good organizer
B00742JW8S|4|Best epilator I've found. Yeah, it is still painful in some areas, and takes a while to get it done on a large area like legs, but any epilator would. I like that it does work and doesn't leave a lot of strays, and that it lasts so long.
B003D7FE80|5|refreshing
B003DNIHFG|5|LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS!
B006LROO6C|1|I was really excited to receive this product and since we are currently stationed oversees I ordered two to stock up. I kept it in my makeup bag and It leaked in my designer bag unexpectedly and I am not sure I will be able to get the &#34;stain&#34; out since the liquid is a dark brown.
B001G7PLPU|5|Ok, I've tried other disposable razors and always come back to this brand & style.  My local store stopped carrying this style and was I forced to purchase online.  While everyone wants the pivoting heads, I think they shave too close to your skin.  If you are having problems with razor burn and irritated skin, then try this razor.  Because it doesn't pivot, you control the angle of the blades.  Plus, the lubricating strip is really nice and the two blades are sufficient.<br />  One razor typically lasts me 4-5 days.  I use Edge shaving cream (purple cap) and Nivea aftershave lotion.<br /><br />  Thank you Amazon.com for selling this razor!
B001KYVO00|1|I paid more for postage than the product itself and it was not worth it. These colors are nice but are very light and fades throughout the day. I rather pay more and have makeup that I do not have to reapply.
B000X2W616|5|My wife saw one in our room while on vacation and liked it. I took the numbers off that one, punched it into Amazon search and voila, now she is using it everyday at home. Nice quality and a nice product.
B002Z0SQ0Y|5|I watch a reality show on tv & one of the people on there mention Bumble & Bumble Shampoo & that was amazing Shampoo. I told my husband i was going to order some & i did best investment ever!! Makes ur hair so soft light weight and easy to brush hait after u shower. The sent isn't over powering but has that wonderful sent of coconut makes u feel like your on the beach. So this is a highly recommended product its amazing! This is my 2nd bottle i have ordered! Only need dime size or so cos makes great lather and leaves ur hair silky soft even good for frizzy and out of control hair like mine.
B000Q2ZQ24|4|I purchased this because I like the scent, and thought it would be perfect for summer. It works fine as a body lotion, but the scent quickly fades and smells more like soap.It wasn't worth the additional cost.
B00E9IQUK8|5|Sooths my skin
B00GOXV6VY|5|Used this only one time, today being my first time, and I am already seeing color! I was going to buy elusive but this was a more reasonable price for my budget, and I'm definitely pleased with it!
B00HVECAL0|4|Works well for acne!
B002PQ8BQM|5|This is an amazing product that I was skeptical to use. Nothing else worked for me so I thought give this a shot, it's only 20 bucks. From the first application it has done wonders and i've been a loyal customer of sweatblock for over a year now.
B009GYVMAS|5|Love it can't wait to buy more
B0009ET86Y|5|Love the 70% aloe vera lotion - my skin does too!  I use nothing else but Jason's for face and body!
B00C8YCFU4|4|Pros: Feels smooth on the skin, works FAST, started clearing up my acne after only a day.<br />Cons: It smells very strong which I expected so I didn't mind, I also want to mention that this burns surprisingly a lot. I do not have sensitive skin and I am used to using products like this but it does hurt when you put it on.
B0086LC0WG|5|Excellent
B004BD8QEO|3|I purchased this shaver, but returned it and purchased the Norelco 1250x SensoTouch 3D instead.  I'm much happier with the Norelco!  The Braun did not shave near as close and it was more difficult to get odd hairs that grow around the neckline.  I wanted to like the Braun better because it doesn't look like an alien spaceship (as the Norelco) and it has a direct plug-in charger rather than a stand (as the Norelco), but the Braun just didn't cut it (pun intended).  Also, the Norelco is VERY quiet, while the Braun is VERY loud and vibrates your face so much it tickles.  Get the Norelco.
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Product is great. The base is very heavy and stays put. I accidentally hit it with my elbow on accident so hard it sent the razor halfway across the bathroom, but the stand barely moved.<br /><br />The quality is superb. This is NOT some chintzy plastic/metal hybrid with a cheap chrome-colored paint over it. I probably couldn't tell the difference between chrome, stainless steel, platinum, or white gold, but I can tell its not cheap plastic.<br /><br />I assume it's made out of whatever it says in the description, because it just feels/looks/seems like good quality. It shines brilliantly when clean, and it fits my Merkur 34C razor perfectly.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed!
B003ES7GRA|5|just as described, love it
B003WR3QSG|5|Feels good, works well. The hairs hold on it, though a couple fall out which is to be expected. In all I feel this product will last a while.
B003V265QW|5|I bought this for my daughter. She's always wanting nice curls in her hair and a regular curling iron just doesn't cut it. This wand is wonderful! Very easy to use and after hours of wear, she still has curls! No need for hairspray either. The glove is essential and I'm very glad it was included. Would definitely recommend.
B00652DGSK|5|awesome - great price
B0013EMBHM|5|This soap is very smooth and silky! The bar was a lot bigger than I expected and I was able to cut it into three separate pieces. The scent is very natural and earthy as well.
B009NNDG4W|3|smells good, has little grit, cost to much,doesn't hold that good, comes in pretty can. WOULDN'T BUY ANYMORE,dadadadadadadadats all folks
B00176F2BS|5|Unlike some other curlers that I saw in the malls or beauty shops, the design and the gold color of this curler totally makes it look good when you just put it in your bedroom.  Not to mention the texture of the grib is really comfortable and the result of using the product was awesome. Loved it and will recommend it to my girl friends.
B004UQPCGM|3|Hydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex comes in a one ounce blue plastic jar with silver top that looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter.  The directions say to massage a thin layer over your face and neck after cleansing.  I gave this product several weeks to do its magic, and used it religiously and properly. Unfortunately, it did no more than any cheap cream would do.<br /><br />The cream is light and has nice, slightly fruity scent.  It feels good going on and disappears quickly into the skin.  It just didn't do a thing for my wrinkles.  I have wrinkles on my forehead, and fine lines around my eyes when I smile or laugh.  I had  special  photos  taken yesterday, and I put an extra dab of this cream on my face the night before, and actually woke up with puffy eyes that looked horrendous.  I rarely have bags under my eyes, but I did yesterday.<br /><br />My pictures were taken and I was horrified and embarrassed by my wrinkled face as the photographer and I looked over the pictures together.  Of course, she will edit those wrinkles out of the pictures, but I can't edit the wrinkles off of my face.  I wish.  And I don't have a huge wrinkle problem yet, just the start of a wrinkle problem.  I have never been a sun worshiper and have never smoked.  I don't think my face would be a huge challenge for a cream that cost what this cream does per ounce.  But it did nothing.  The proof is in my portraits.  I'm seriously considering surgery now.
B0031RCY58|5|Fabulous stuff.  I have to order it here because I cannot find it in the store anymore.  I received it fast and it was as ad says.
B005NW9TBQ|5|It works, but gradually. I have been using this soap for the past few months and my skin color has definitely lightened a few shades! The smell is great too, and is not too fragrant! Would definitely buy again!
B000V9M8B4|5|I use this shampoo once a week or whenever I do a deep conditioning treatment in my hair with oil. I usually use coconut or castor oil which are very thick oils so this shampoo gets that out without having to double wash. You shouldn't shampoo your hair every day so I wouldn't recommend using this every day or every other day. You should only use clarifying shampoo if you have a lot of build up from products and oils. I'm in the process of growing out my hair so this is a very good shampoo to clear out your scalp follicles and get them really clean so hair grows healthy which is a key to getting longer hair. This only costs .99 cents at the dollar store so don't spend anymore then that for this product or you'll be ripped off.
B000TGEJT8|5|Wow, I love this shampoo. It smells so great. It's wonderful on my hair. I am so glad a friend of mine told me aobut it. I definitely recommend buying this.
B009FIF1RK|5|They're exactly as shown and described.  This is human hair BTW.  I've curled them already. Very nice blue color. Seems decent quality.  If you are looking for all over volume order 2 packs.
B00ECUPDZQ|5|I purchased this for a Halloween costume so I can't comment on lasting durability with continuous use, but I think it's very well made.  It's extremely soft, softer than I thought fake hair would be and it doesn't really look fake except for the fact that I purchased a bright color.
B0085Y98VA|4|I would have given a five star rating but the packaging was terrible to the point a couple of the eye shadows broke and one of the colors from the palette was completely missing. Despite the poor packaging on amazon's part, the colors are very highly pigmented and I definitely recommend this product.
B004X89NH6|5|Item was exactly as describes. Very soft. Lays on powder foundation very smoothly. Ribbon on top makes them easy to hold. Would definitely order again. Considering price per puff this is a food value.
B005O30Q0M|2|These are very dry and are not creamy at all so its hard to apply. becayse they are not creamy they don't smooth on well and just make your lines more exaggerated. I have to mix it with concealer to make it a better consistency. Pay extra and get a not dry version of this
B00G0NUQ4G|3|Was looking for a dark purple and this wasn't it. It's more of a raisin color.
B00KN35BJO|5|light how it makes my hair feel and shine. Excellent product!
B00NV1V6TE|2|They didn't even last 2 seconds
B00370R4CM|4|I think it did pretty decent results, but I like it mostly for the smell. It smells like a really strong herby scent, which sounds nasty, but its actually pretty addicting once smelt.
B002O0D8P8|2|I like Nioxin.  I just wonder if this was the real deal.  Am now leery of buying this product on line, even though usually cheaper.
B00I5H5Y56|5|I have used whitening strips, but they seem to leave the area near the gum line, untouched. Not so with this tooth polish because everywhere you brush, gets treated. Granted, it doesn't work as quickly as the strips, but I'm not usually in a rush to whiten my teeth.<br /><br />You can tell this isn't toothpaste by it's texture and there's a little grit or roughness to it, nothing really noticeable unless you think about it. i used this for a month, pretty regularly and it did a nice job of whitening my teeth; I'd recommend this product.
B00KLONWUU|5|My girlfriend loved it! Incredible scent!<br />If you're a guy, get it for your lady!
B003YJAZZ4|5|I opened this new shaver morning (790-CC4), charged it, and started using it. I like the variable setting (3-steps) for mild to intense. I like the feel of it and although the display is less sophisticated than my old one, this one might be more practical in usage. It has a Li-Ion battery and so is a bit lighter, and seems well-constructed.
B000FPOGEG|5|Fit perfectly, price great.
B00B0XFUUQ|5|This is a great accessory to go with my VB travel bags
B00KSPUN04|5|My hair smells so good when I used it. My curls looks amazing
B005PR20LK|1|I've been dying my hair for years, the pretty much the only thing going for this stuff is that it smells alright.  There is absolutely no way that this dye made as dark a purple as shown in the sample unless that hair was made of fabric or paper.  I left it in for hours over bleached hair and with one rinse it looks faded and old and definitely not a dark purple, more like a reddish plum.  Fork over your dough for Special Effects hair dye, that stuff lasts so much longer and the colors are wonderful, even when fading.
B003IILPIC|3|I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT VERY FAST WITHIN A FEW DAYS. AS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT IT DID NOT DO WELL FOR MY HAIR BUT MY HUSBAND LIKES IT FOR HIMSELF, SO NOT ALL WAS LOST.
B00AO4E9E0|5|This works great on African American hair. My daughter is natural and I use this along with the 7 day conditioner and spray and it keeps her hair soft and straight for more than 7 days. I will continue to use Tresemme products!
B00IE9EO5Q|5|Love the product. One pump dispenser of order totally un-useable.
B00DIIVKQ4|5|Love the large size - will probably reorder! holds the oils snuggly<br />I keep it stored in my nightstand - works great.<br />It is as described!
B000EN0ORW|4|Strong, versatile and good quality tool. Popped me some good ones with this without damaging the surrounding skin.
B004QYTLHE|5|These are quality made bottles with a nice sprayer. Excellent for oils !!  No negatives.
B0053ZUQ2O|5|Great customer service from this guy... Highly recomended
B000J2CTYE|5|I already wrote a review about the fragrance itself...sexy, subtel, seductive, very feminine and mature (but not mature like old lady..oohhhhh no!) It's also very versatile, it can be worn every day and be appropriate for every setting. But anyway, I just wanted to say how great it is that they have this larger bottle.  It's a nice savings compared to buying the roll ons.  I still have a roll on for my purse though.  I'm obsessed with this perfume!  Auric Blends in general have really made some truly delicious scents, and such high quality oils for so little money! Does it get much better than that? I think not.
B0049S5DFG|4|A very good, simple way to clean off eye makeup.  My only concern is that although they're supposed to be non-allergenic, I do find that they affect my eyes a little and I must use eye drops to clear that up.
B003NRYG4S|5|I love the adjustable height and the collapsability. Perfect for contact lens or makeup application from a vanity.
B00881SGYK|5|I ordered this to replace my Essie All-In-One Base Coat since I need a base coat that strengthens and helps with ridges.  I couldn't be more happy with the extra strength this adds to my thin/sometimes flake prone nails and while it does take a while to dry, using it as a top coat gives an incredibly shiny finish.  If I'm in a hurry, I'll go back to my quick dry top coat (also by Essie) but I much prefer this formula.  Using this as both a base and top coat seals my manicure for a good 7-10 days, which is unheard of with my nails (I'm lucky to get 3-4 days normally).
B008ZM2KDA|1|I bought this product on Amazon a little bit nervous and my gut feeling is right. I attempted to register the product right away after opening the box. While registering the product on Clarisonic.com, product # is needed. You should be able to find the number printed at the bottom of the handle. There is NONE!!! So I went on amazon and carefully read the reviews, I saw someone mentioned this problem that they cannot make any claims (warranty or return) as Clarisonic was able to say right away that the products were fake. They do not sell on amazon. I didn't want to take a chance to wait till it stops working and won't be able to return. I returned the product right away. I was able to get the product with 20% coupon discount at Sephora at the same price.
B0081J255U|5|This works well to dry nails quickly, and it has a timer so you can see haw much time you have left
B00IAJZZO4|2|The color is a lot more of a red/orange than the one pictured. Unless your lips are completely smooth and moisturized then this will bring out flaws.
B0079R6BD2|5|Quality hair product. It helps hair loss prevention. Smells good too.
B00GOYH4PA|5|I received the Argan oil today. After opening that wonderful Amazon box I put it on my hands and...WOW...I fell in love! It's amazing and I will be using it on my face tonight and tomorrow morning. Can't forget my hands, they loved it too!  I will definitely be ordering this again.
B004Y99EO6|5|Works well and doesn't take up too much counter-top space. My 7 & 9 year olds can operate it with minimal mess.
B0018S2L1Y|5|Really good brush. Exactly what I was looking for. Reminds me of one I had when I was younger.
B00ENU1SP4|5|When I first tried these for my foundation, I was really surprised. The brushes are so soft, but they aren't too fluffy like other brushes. I really love these!
B00E4VJHBO|2|did not workat all only like aybe an hour did you actually see the color on hair
B004Y9GVZG|4|Loved how well it hid under eye baggage, dark circles, and harsh lines.
B009VGNVL4|1|best deodorant  ever - however I opened the first one in this order and it is runny and not a good situation- I wish I could contact someone as this is almost useless in this form!
B002QI2UKC|4|DEFINITELY a lot more pink than it sows in the picture. I'm not actually sure why it's called &#34;Peach&#34; at all. Peaches sure aren't this color. Nice quality and works well, but I definitely have to tone it down. Just don't expect it to be &#34;Peach&#34;
B00066MI0S|5|wish there was more in the bottle. I have a good amount of hair that eats moisturizers. It works well but I I still need something a little stronger.
B0052SK1UO|1|Doesnt blow out enough heat, didnt curl or smooth out my hair the way a normal blow dryer and round brush does.i thought since it was pretty pricey,it would actually work for my hair.didnt do anything but waste time.
B0012FJIVE|5|Got this for Santa outfit. I grew a white beard, but needed to spray my grey mustashe, eyebrows & sideburns. The white spray looked natural. Wife used makeup remover pads to cleanup the over spray. Kids thought I was the real deal. Not enough paint to use more than twice. Next year, I'll order two cans. This color is VERY white. Looks even whiter in photos.
B00P0BLZFI|1|Does not clasp together
B00AAJOZN4|5|Yup.  Turns out, if a tweezer is sharp it will grab those pesky little hairs better.  Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening on its products to keep them at their hair-plucking finest.  Unfortunately, mine are the grossest shade of green.  Wish they were the pretty purple.
B000141E1O|5|These will help with the slits I make in top of chain and mustache. Perfect for this and not permanent in case I want to change it up. It might be better if they lasted for a month till next payday. 18 would be perfect for what I'm doing when I do slits in my forehead alternating black and blond and for top chin and mustache so I'd actually will need 24 per month so 48 per month since they last 2 weeks. I want to use them for shaving above lip and below lip. I don't need shaving cream for nothing.
B00B7ORKLA|5|I love this cream! It's organic, odorless, dries quickly, and I can wear a silk blouse immediately with no worries about stains. It's highly recommended for women undergoing radiation for breast cancer. My skin never looked better.
B00IAASWNE|5|This product worked well on my human hair wig piece.  It actually made it softer and more manageable.  Good buy!
B002ZG94UY|4|I have almost used up my first tube, ordering my second now. I used it for all of June, July and August - though not as often as the instructions state. I have noticed that the stretch marks from my recent pregnancy (delivered March 31) have decreased in color significantly.  I would recommend this to anyone. I also gave it four stars for the VERY strong scent.  I do not dislike it, but I know there are people who are very sensitive to scents and this would be very unpleasant for those folks.
B007NQO5EG|4|I've used a number of Yes To products, and have liked most of them. This leave-in conditioner is no exception. I have highlighted hair and after repeated blow drying and curlings, my hair can feel dry. I like the Yes To brand for a number of reasons-the most important being safe ingredients, no paragons, etc.<br /><br />The directions say to use a quarter-sized amount. I have shoulder length hair and used a dime sized amount, which seemed plenty. My hair feels soft but not weighed down. Some people commented on the scent--I did not notice a scent, which is fine by me.<br /><br />I will continue to use this product. It's hard to find a leave-in conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down, but this is working for me.
B0090HAYNW|5|Perfect for the price, and the base is easy to apply, this color makes my skin brighter.
B000143C0K|5|The Andis T-outliner works great, lasts for years with consistent lubrication...after use. Highly recommended for everyday and professional applications. thank you
B00FR0FWUG|1|When I received this item, it was more of a size B then a size F.
B001ELJO0Q|5|These are AMAZING...compact, and all the reviews are true. Looked and worked exactly like everyone posted.
B00GA9FWFS|5|great Thanks
B00876T3W0|5|These are so adorable! Will definitely nut again.
B008XWYBF2|5|Ok, so I have been using this foundation along with the warmth all over face color and the mineral veil since the beginning of last December and I give it 4.5 stars. I wanted to really use this stuff before I wrote any kind of review. First off I have combo skin, it can get pretty oily in the T-zone. Since I have been using this stuff my skin stays 90% oil free all day. I usually put it on around 6am and it isn't washed off until before I go to bed. I have never ever tried a makeup that has been so good with keeping my face shine free. As all of us combo/oily skin girls know you can put your makeup on and it will look good for a couple hrs and then you are a slick face shortly after! :) I definatly recommend getting color matched at the store. I would have chosen the wrong color for myself. I have light-medium skin tone, and this stuff runs lighter than what you would think. I got the med tan and it matches perfectly. One thing I also noticed is that you need to use it sparingly around the eyes, it says it can be used as a concealer but when I first started using it I noticed that it really enhanced the fine lines around my eyes, and I just turned 27 so I really dont have lines yet. My eyes looked better w/o the product on so I just started lightly putting it around the eye area. I have also noticed that my acne has decreased to almost nothing. I didnt have it to bad to begin with but I think because it really helps control the oil it helped clear my acne. I dont like to use the foundation by itself, but paired with the warmth (which gives a beautiful healthy glow to my skin) and the mineral veil. I have tried using the warmth with other foundations and it doesnt give the same effect. you have to use it with the bare minerals set. I recently tried to switch to revlon colorstay because stuff can be kind of pricey and since you have to buy the warmth and veil, I was trying to save money, but I came back to this because I love it so much, and I love the fact that the ingredients are actually good for my skin. I also have to say that my first compact of this lasted me over three months. So it does tend to last quite a while for me anyways. I really have to say the only downside for me is the price, and you have to be careful not too put too much on and go light around the eye area. Other than that I really recommend people to try. I know everyone is different but it is worth a shot. I really like it. I hope this review helps, it is by far the longest one I've ever wrote LOL!ngredients are actually good for my skin.

B004CZSVZ0|5|best thing for natural hair
B00L2RFR58|5|Makes my skin feel soft
B008XBGNDG|5|Great quantity with cheap price.
B00RWG5H6C|5|To my lover to buy, she is practical after noon sleep a lot, I should have bought a long time ago
B000SY38PM|5|I use this every nite while deployed to keep my skin hydrated and smooth.  Doesn't take alot and works as expected.  Can't beat the price.  Not sticky and doesn't leave any type of flaky substance on my skin.
B005KPAEYM|5|My father has always been a fan of this cologne and I got him some more for Christmas. Very nice smelling.
B0069FEPCE|4|Although the items inside are the same, the box that they come in isn't as pretty as the box shown in the picture. Instead of the round package it came in a pink, square box. Not a huge disappointment or anything, just not what I was expecting.
B00C3LIU88|3|It does resemble common box store merchandise. It's entirely made of hard plastic, including the teeth, and it pulls my hair.  So you'll have to place it carefully about where you want it so that there's less tugging/hair pulling involved.
B00I32AN4K|5|It smells great. leaves my hair very smooth.
B000EVELR8|1|Just go for your shaver...
B003L0LWYY|5|Her old dryer was going out so I bought her this one as a surprise and she loves it!  Uses it every day.
B00880WDK4|1|It looks like a used bottle. No label on it. The label that is on it with the color number is all scratched up like it was taken off another bottle and put on.  Not a very good buy.
B003LA90RU|5|Bought this product for my daughter she loves it will not use anything else , will buy this again thank you 9/8/13
B00F644L32|5|First of all I recieced this in just a few days! The packaging was great, came in a box very protected. Product smells amazing and feels great! Will definitely purchase again
B00D5V3H88|3|okay
B006DFZ8E4|4|This is a really great set!  I bought the nail oil after I ran out of what came in the set.
B004JERPM4|3|I have not seen a difference in hair growth since I switched to this. I will give it more time. I have only used it consistently for one month. I usually use the minoxidil liquid from Walgreens which works wonders but it dries my scalp really bad. This does not dry my scalp but...I need results.
B0009XH6TG|5|Best hairdryer on the market. Not too loud and dries hair fast. I should have bought 2
B005P0HH60|5|This moisturizing cream was recommended by my dermatologist. It has no fragrances or irritating additives. A little goes a long way, and it is soothing for my sensitive skin. I have rosacea and must be very careful about products I use. This is the best I've found.
B00H168ZDK|5|Great alternative to the expensive Clarisonic brush heads. I used this for the Mia brush and they fit in and work perfectly.
B00021CPCS|5|I loved this product. will buy again
B008G0J3M2|3|Decent product, but I could've used Organix and gotten the same results if not better.  This is better than the shampoo.  BEWARE!!!!  Don't buy the shampoo (at least not from this seller-  It is not the real thing)!!!!!!!!
B004OXADJC|3|very light scent
B003STU190|5|This is my all time fave lotion! I will never again buy it from vendors at the mall.. I suggest those of you reading this do the same! You can get 10x more product if you buy it online! Thank you for providing me with an amazing product for an unbeatable price!
B002U774PK|3|I have had this product for almost a year. Used it religously for 6 months and then cut back some. I do not see any difference in my skin.
B00RQD6XFK|5|beautiful
B0015S1DZW|5|Only deodorant I use.
B000BNRKPY|4|I'm using this for the Oil Cleansing Method, I put about 20% of this with the rest Grape Seed Oil or Sunflower seed oil and am getting great results.
B00ATQA06E|3|Batteries are expensive. Old batteries when delivered
B002ZJW1SS|5|Husband loves Camay - he is happy he found it again  - as mentioned you cannot find it in stores
B004G1GJ4U|5|I like these products.  I usually do not wear makeup on a daily schedule, but I was able to make myself look nice with this type of eyeliner.  I would buy again.
B001IAINFU|4|Easy to take off but doesn't smear. I don't think it builds up my lashes as well as other mascaras though.
B000JS0X64|4|The first time we used it, it leaked, due to us not putting the flap down under her head.  Otherwise, it is fine.
B0018A32XS|4|Works great on legs.  Totally painless, close shave.  I can't wait to try it wet.  I didn't like using this for my underarms and I even tried my bikini area.  For my bikini area, it felt like it was pulling my hairs out and after the fact, it was almost like it cut a top layer of skin off as the area was reddened and sore as if the skin was open.  I will continue to use this product for my legs since it is much easier than shaving with a razor blade and will probably continue using it for my underarms but I will stick to the tried and true method of razor blades for my bikini area or waxing.  Still, I am very happy with my first purchase of an electric razor.  Comes with a convenient charging station that is compact so that it doesn't take up two  electrical outlets. :D
B008DKYM8K|2|I like the soap but it says it is fragrance free and still has a bit of an odor which I do not care for.  Not planning to try it again  unless there is nothing else I can find to use in the simple human hand soap dispenser I bought. Also it is too expensive and leaves my hands kind of dry.
B00EZM9ESS|4|I love these. They look amazing with matte top coat. Only negative is the colors will rub off stud. So if you like to keep your nail color for a week or more be prepared for disappointment.
B0001ZWQUQ|3|The bottle had to many scratches on it, the box presented serious damage and this perfume was suppose to be a gift and I couldn't give in those conditions.
B00HQ9PTUO|1|Tried one of the soaker, it cracked right away. Look like the pink plastic are brittle.
B001PO6NRE|5|Nice & solid, but light-weight wrap. I live in the southwest, where it seldom gets too cold...this wrap is the perfect weight! It's not see-through either! I highly recommend it to everyone!
B003E0ZN6Y|5|I've been using this product for years and love it.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little extra body and wants their hair to feel natural and luxurious.
B004M1BO3U|5|My dental hygienist recommended this product. At first my tickle response was outrageous, but I stayed with it and now enjoy my sonic session, that is timed automatically to shut off after 2 minutes.
B00ABVI6CW|3|The mask is comfortable, but the straps broke almost immediately after just sleeping normally.
B001P4VYMS|4|Still like it, recommend to others.  G L. Bullock
B0009W7M82|1|Very dissapointed!!! Too hard to use<br />Did not stay in place<br />Would not buy again<br />I would not give a star At all
B0014WJLPS|5|This is the third one of these Revitalash Eyelash Conditioners I have purchased. They seem to last me about 6-7 months. It works extremely well and I just love the product. I'll buy again in another 6 months!
B00ID8H1N0|4|Great hairsetter!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that it does get very hot.  I have a glove I got with a flat iron which I use sometimes when my fingers can't handle the heat.  Heats up quickly - makes great, long-lasting curls!  Good value!
B00FIAZI72|5|Pricey but gorgeous and I'm not disappointed a bit!
B00N30SE3E|5|Great product. Easy to use.!
B001517QXW|5|I have been looking for this everywhere! This is my sister's favorite perfume and it is so hard to find. It smells beautiful and the price is great. Great size for carrying in purse or pocket!
B007S1TE7E|5|I love this. Put a little mist on it and it blends perfectly. I'd buy this over the beauty blender ANY DAY. I seriously love how it blends out my foundation. AMAZING!
B003TW70E0|4|Works great and trims all the advertised areas - but eventually the blade will get dull - anyone know where a replacement blade is available??
B00C7WG90O|5|Best price ive found so far for this perfume... came fast and undisturbed... no issues.
B0062K4A94|2|There is a ton of silicone in this and so it cannot really moisturize the hair. I used this after to seal my wash and go. It made my hair very poofy and dry. My hair was unable to keep in any moisture because that is what silicone does. It is a barrier. I have thick curly/wavy hair 3a-3c. Not a good product for naturally curly girls!
B000WHNI2I|1|Fake
B0009OAHQ4|5|This product i recommend it to any guy who wants to get female attention!!!<br /><br />i did not buy it to get any but man this does work i applied it in the morning and till afternoon i could still the sweet smell<br />i even put my dirty shirt(bora bora apllied)  among dirty clothes even after a week taking them out for washing them i still could feel the good smell of bora bora....
B0053L2E1O|1|I got it in the mail after 5 days . I am a Ghanaian so I knew what I was buying . And what I received wasn't the black soap . Instead I received a 16oz block of Shea butter . Yes Shea butter. If what you received it of white color and not the color advertised you received the wrong product . ! No it's not the same thing . Is just Shea butter ! Which is more of a oil product that is normally used more hair dressing ! Not to treat acne and cleanse the face ! Very dissappointed ! I had high hopes for this product .
B00JJ6MVBW|5|Love it! Teeth look great and live that clean feeling!
B00TXQM1U4|5|B
B00S48YZ4C|4|Comb works great and holds up very well for being wood!  Love this product !!
B007L99U4A|3|It's...okay.  The slight shimmer is nice, it's not sparkly enough to make you feel like you should take up pole dancing and change your name to Cinnamon, but rather it is a subtle micro shimmer that isn't really noticeable under office lights. You can see it a bit more in sunlight, but that's kind of nice. What I didn't care for is the scent when it's first applied. It's stronger than I'd like, which is just my opinion. It does mellow out after about a half hour, so by the time I get to work it's fine...but when I first get in the car in the morning it makes me glad I'm not carpooling.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|Sometimes when I'm ready for bed and don't feel like flossing, the water pic does it for you in a flash. Love it! My husband loves it also.
B000TKH6FI|5|Perfect product, exactly as I described and exactly what I was looking for!!
B000GHWTPQ|5|Bought it for my mother as a Christmas gift. As described and fast shipping.
B002WTC37U|5|This is an amazing product! My hair has never been shinier or softer. And the scent is fantastic! I was worried that my hair would be greasy, but you only need a small amount and it is completely absorbed. I highly recommend this product and the others I bought from this company through Amazon.com.
B003ATS2QC|5|Very nice product. Sleek, low profile. Works easily, turns on with a light touch and settles quickly on the final weight. Arrived quickly and was very reasonably priced.
B0054Y2744|3|Ok
B00FVRCQ0Y|5|Best clean deodorant ever! It lasts all day and I never smell like b.o. I won't use anything else ever again.
B0029ERWH4|4|This palette came in perfect condition - none of the eyeshadows, liners, or blushes were cracked or damaged during shipment.  Initially the pigmentation seemed poor as the makeup barely showed up on my olive skin and easily disappeared during the day.  However, I began using the NYX eye primer and my own concealer as a base over the primer... and voila!  The colors show up beautifully.  Plenty of colors to select from.  My biggest issue with this is that the lighter colors don't stay as long as the darker ones do.  The pigmentation in shade ranges is quite different from light to dark, so my pretty highlighted areas were gone in a few hours each time i tried them.  I'm looking at Urban Decay's palettes now that I've played around with the cheap stuff - their shadows are highly pigmented and have a base built in.  This is a great palette for experimenting with eyeshadow application.
B00347VFBY|1|made my son's eczema worse, his skin began to crack and bleed after a week of using this.  save your money and just get some cetaphil .
B000050B6H|5|good heads, little expense
B00HH53R7E|5|This serum is fantastic!  I had gotten the Llano moisturizer before and loved it so I decided to try the serum as well and I was not disappointed!  It has really helped to brighten and soften my dull winter skin and it smells like fresh oranges.  I use it once in the morning and once in the evening followed by the Llano moisturizer and I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to brighten their complexion and soften their skin!
B003YJAZZE|5|I've tried a lot of other electric razors and have dealt with my fair share of disappointment. I haven't had it more than a few days so I can't comment on things like the longevity of the cleaning system, but I have to say that this is far and away the most effective electric razor I've ever dealt with. We all know that no electric razor is going to be quite as close as an against-the-grain shave with a blade, but this must be as close as I can think to get with all of the convenience that you get from an electric.  I wholeheartedly recommend. There's a reason that even Consumer Reports rates this one so highly.
B00BF7K75U|4|Nothing special, it a mirror. But it is really cute.<br />Would make a great add on gift or an extra for a bridal gift for the girlsReally cute
B000ZXDKCM|5|I ordered this product based on a recommendation received by a friend to assist in making my nails more healthy and less brittle! Within one week, I could notice a difference! For a week, I was unable to use the product due to traveling (I forgot to pack it) so I was afraid my nails would revert back...not at all!!! Great buy!
B00EJVXHAG|5|love it I had it before
B00387F7F0|5|Our local store was always out of this item.  So I ordered this large supply from Amazon.  Now we won't be running to the store every time we run out!
B00E4U5JJY|5|I find these to be  the best of the hot flash cooling towelettes.  Too bad they are discontinuing them. But typical.
B002CVTVVY|3|It's good, it cleans, and the battery life is still excellent after more than one year of usage (about one week using it 2-3 times a day)<br />The problem is that compared with the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 I had before, it does not clean as well. I don't even think that is available anymore, but their system is way more efficient. It must be a reason why the dentists' cleaning tools have the same circular move, and not the oscillating one the Philips uses.<br />A thought this comparison might be useful, since I used the Oral-B for about three years before the battery died completely, and I am using the Philips for more than a year already.
B003ABIDAA|4|This works great for my thick curly hair. It keeps my haor soft but helps my curls stayand less frizz. Can't beat amazons price either.
B00P8XOOWO|4|It is a nice dark color but I have trouble using it, maybe because I am inexperienced with makeup but it is only slightly waterproof. When I mess up and use make up remover and try to apply it again (after taking off the makeup remover), the eyeliner becomes faded and hard to use...
B002XURD32|5|I am so happy that I bought this. Lots of people told me that I have clear skin. I look younger! Very good!!
B00E6HRCOA|1|cant tie them batteries all fall out!!!!!!  It took forever to figure it out, and the case was loose all the batteries fell out, can not tie them, a warte!!!
B001440150|5|Love the fragrance and the texture and the way I feel after bathing makes me happy to shower or bath with
B00ACB6H9A|5|Its small and great for traveling or for somebody who has thin or short hair! love the design and price,but its not the greatest quality so i don't think i would buy it for everyday hair styling?!
B00B1XHKGW|5|Great toothpaste!
B00EOB0042|5|I have tried countless &#34;natural&#34; deodorants and spent so much money on trying to find something that I can wear for hours and hours that works. My search ended when I found Green Tidings! I can put it on at 7 am and continue smelling fresh well into the night, even after I take a yoga or spin class! It's the best!
B00IY5I4SS|5|Good item!
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|Works as well as advertised and for the least expensive price I found anywhere. Couldn't be happier.
B00HAYBLTS|4|Love the ease of applying this cream blush. The color is a bit dark for me but that's okay. I'll still use it but probably order a different color as well.
B002ZW1RJY|5|Amazing coverage, friends want to know where they can get their hands on it.
B000OQOOZM|4|great cologne hands down and for the price you'll be so surprised how long the fragrance lasts, often lingering after clothes have been washed. you'll get many compliments on this, i've tried many colognes but i keep coming back to this one. more importantly it's a bit intoxicating to women. don't believe me then try some. just be sure to leave a comment after you try it.
B004H5D40W|4|Product is very sturdy. Made of hard plastic, which is a good thing in this case.  It has short stiff bristles on the bottom & a small heel pumice stone. The bristles on top are long & fairly soft. Suction cups on the bottom to hold it to the shower floor. I have diabetes & was looking for 'help' with my feet. For me I wish the upper bristles were stiffer. Other than that the product is perfect for general foot cleaning. You still have to bend over & apply the soap.( I guess you could squirt liquid soap on it.) I am still happy with my purchase.
B003T18TE6|5|Great transaction. Love this product!  I have naturall dark hair. That I had it lifted to a very light blonde!! It has made a world of difference to my over processes hair
B00AMOI8YY|5|I love this one. The smell is mesmerizing! Highly recommended for girlie girls! Sometimes I wish it never runs out! Yummy
B003V265QW|5|I bought this for my cousin and she absolutely loves it! She is still figuring out to get loose curls, but she says it was worth the money. She can't thank me enough. Buy this product if you want bouncy curls! :)
B00K233NGS|5|Love it. It made my hair soft and took away the frizz. Plus it smells amazing.
B003D1KV8O|4|This is the first time I purchased this large 33.6oz container of Rinse online. I have previously used the small container that was purchased at the Salon.   I absolutely love the smell of this rinse! It leaves my hair feeling so silky and smooth!! Other products left my hair feeling like straw..this is great!!  My only issue is; the smaller container was very thick and I only needed to use such a dab to go a long way. With this larger container, I find it very \\"diluted\\" compared to what I had from the smaller container. So, I find I need to use more of it which in turn will not be saving me any money, but actually costing me more.   So possibly it may be more penny wise to order the smaller Hydrate Me Rinse...IT IS SUPER!
B008X3PCVS|5|Great try me size. Its clean and refreshing, like a sparkling water fall another great scent philosophy offers...Thank you for carrying this
B00XQLLQ94|4|Okay, I know, this is not a pleasant thing to discuss. But we all get pimples and blocked pores. Even though we're all told not to pop or pick at them, I'm very guilty of it. So if you gotta do it, The Tropical Holistic Blackhead and Pimple Remover Tool Kit allows you to take care of business in a safer and more sanitary manner, without getting bacterial from your hands into the mix. It also will lessen the damage to the surrounding tissue, which means less giant puffy bumps.<br /><br />These are nice and shiny, and look to be good quality. I personally washed mine before using them, just to be sure, and of course, after. It's a fairly basic set, but it does the job.<br /><br />I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and bad skin habits are my own.
B000SON2IA|4|I had so many sleepless nights due to bed bugs. When I realized I bought this product on amazon & as per the instructions I have tried to spray the liquid in the home & cleaned some. It was awesome, it did a great job
B0030ZRSHK|2|I fell in love with hard wax when I purchased an expensive blue one from ulta that comes in a microwaveable cup.  The microwaving was annoying so I decided to buy a warmer and went with this &#34;hard wax&#34; because of the reviews-  this does not shrink wrap your hair like the fancy blue stuff-  its sticky and takes forever to take off.  I will never buy this again-  it was such a waste of money
B000KWV6F6|4|I have loved this product for years and was so sad when they stopped making this version of the \\"just bitten\\" stain. Thankfully it's still available through Amazon. Like others have said, be careful with the cap which cracks easily. It goes on smoothly and looks best if you smooth it on a little with your finger after applying. It works nicely too as a cheek stain as long as your skin is moisturized. When it's half way gone, I mix it with Benetint to thin it out a bit. Cherry Tart is a true red - not too blue, not too orangy (think cherry Blowpop). I can wear it for three or so hours without reapplication, but I am using it lightly and smoothing it out with my finger for a sheerer look. It is much more intense and longer lasting when applied directly. I add a regular plain lip balm for moisture or gloss to dress it up and it looks great. Enjoy!
B00D0NKL58|5|OMG!!! This really works!  I was buying for twice the price fro the doctor's office!  Very sold on this item!!!
B00S6XZ936|1|Its really a crappy lip stain , it chunks , and it doesnt last at all !!! Was not pleased with this product and wont be buying ever again
B002WUUL5A|5|This was a gift for my best friend, she loves the products. She is running low and asked if I would re-order another kit for her.  Will be ordering again soon.
B00372DYFQ|5|Great stuff
B001M5IMHU|5|this is such a beautiful scent its what a magical rose from a fairytail would smell like...scent lingers for 4-5hrs
B0073B3F06|5|Love the way this product makes my hair feel.  And so many people comment on how shiny the gray in my hair is.  Impossible to find anywhere else anymore but on Amazon.com - so I keep a supply on hand in case it goes away for good.
B00CC7OGTU|4|I liked and recommend.
B00DNL5666|2|This protector is not that great. It does an okay job of protecting the screen, but within a few weeks of applying the protector it started to get bubbles and eventually peeled off. For the price I was better off getting the cheapo screen protectors from Wal-Mart and disposing after they peeled off. Definitely was expecting more.
B003IW4AS0|5|I started using this product when Pentrax was taken off the market.  I hate that I must use it almost daily to fight back my seborrhea but it is very effective.  Unsure what the long term consequences will be with the exposure to the coal tar.
B00G5LCU6U|3|The product seemed not to have much of an effect on my back and body, but I still use the exfoliating towel. Would be nice if they actually gave enough of the benzoyl peroxide to last the intended time frame.
B002SJ4ADO|5|Work great with New Norelco Razor previously purchased. I doesn't matter if it is very Humid, Like in Panama, Or Dry, like in San Bernardino, CA.....this pre-shaver Powder WORKS !!!
B003Y5DQUE|5|This microdermabrasion machine is worth every penny I had some wrinkles and I hated myself, with the help of this machine my wrinkles are not so deep anymore,  It increased glow to my skin with decreased wrinkles, scars, acne. I feel also my skin is softer
B009Q011OO|5|Helps plump up my post-menopausal thinning hair and looks exactly like my hair. Be careful with the clips so as not to damage your own hair or cause breakage and feel like you have nice, thick, flowy hair again!
B005NZ6790|1|I'm not sure why, but his hairclipper is loud.  It vibrates a lot and the noise was so loud that our kids were too scared to get their hair cut.  It seemed to cut okay, but due to the noise we are unable to use it on our kids and had to get another one.  Because I basically had to discard the product I'm giving it a 1.
B0015NZ6FK|4|good. The earplug is working well.
B000XR8NPY|5|The smudge sticks arrived very fast.  The size was larger than I expected but I was delighted with that.  The fragrance and quality of the sticks was excellent.  I highly reccommend this seller. I would do business with them again
B003X4MQM0|5|Fast delivery, priced well
B00HS55ZQE|5|Love it!
B002KD97UO|4|I love the instyler. I use it at least once a week and i love how soft it makes my hair feel and how shiny it makes my hair look. The only problem i have had is it gets really hot and it doesnt have any guards on the rotating barrel and I hit the top of my ear with it and burnt it pretty bad but as long as you are careful it is the best straighting tool on the market and DEFINATELY worth the price
B000VCBDRQ|5|Tired of the old gray cane?  Why not get one in a brilliant design with an ergonomically curved cane?  The curved cane is superior  to the old-fashiioned canes of the past.  The strap keeps your cane secure while you shop.<br /><br />For added stability, you can replace the tip with a 4-cornered one and have the same product  as a Hurrycane, but with much more stability.<br /><br />Mine is a cool hippie pink flower print with the 4-point bottom for added stability.
B001UTHXTQ|5|The product is very nice and the Customer service is outstanding.  I never heard of the product before but found it interesting so I thought that I would give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did! product is AWESOME.  I will definetly be ordering from them again.
B001ET7ACW|5|Holds nicely all day.  Great for spiking.  It does not leave any sort of gel flakes nor does it appear to irritate my scalp.
B009XY1SKK|5|I've been using DriBlade for a year and wouldn't be caught without one for my Harry's Razor. I have one in my travel bag and one in each apartment. It's great for travel as it protects my razor in addition to extending the useful life of Harry's razor blades. In fact, I've suggested that Harry's buy the company as it would be a natural fit
B00IKSIZKQ|5|Very good!
B00K2O3NV2|5|Hyaluronic Acid Serums usually offer amazing moisturizing benefits for the skin, however a lot of Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past do not deliver enough moisture to my skin and some of them even make it feel a bit dryer, so moisturizer over it is a must. InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum actually hydrates my skin well enough and I do not need any other facial cream over it. I apply the serum in the morning after I wash and tone my face. It feels a little bit sticky for the first 15 seconds and once is dry I can not even feel that is there. InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum leaves my skin moisturized and soft and it is good for under makeup as well. I have combination skin that is acne prone however I had no side effects or breakouts while using this serum. InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a huge 2 fl oz/60 ml bottle that will last for a while.<br />__________________________________<br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.

B00OWLTUWC|5|Great lip exfoliation for the price. It works great, I just rub some on with my fingers then whipe the excess off then apply my balm then my lip stick (even the most drying of lipstick) then im good to go. No more peeling.
B004DK0UDA|5|It is a great product, just as good as the name brand. They are HIGHLY recommended. The plates are made of a high quality metal and come protected in a small package.
