B00004WG2F|5.0|This is one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful movies I have ever seen. It is in my top 5 movies of all time and definately my favourite Brad Pitt movie.
B00005T30L|3.0|Movie was but really good at the first half hour after that there is really nothing exciting and it started to be tedious near the end  and I felt like banging my head on the wall hoping my sense of reality would be restored
B00003CY5J|5.0|Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando and Angela Basette star in this interesting little film about a veteran robber, (De Niro) his friend Max,(Played wonderfully by Marlon Brando) who sets up jobs for him, and a new comer in the buisness (Norton) who plan to pull off a large heist of a French <BR>National treasure; a golden royal sceptre to be specific, incrusted in jewels.<BR>All the charecters were played to their best possible performance, in a laxed environment feuled by a beutiful collection of Jazz tunes.<BR>This film is over-looked but very well done.
B00005QEO2|5.0|A great double disc set highlighting Aerosmith's greatest hits.<BR>But this isn't just another GH album.  The rare cuts and live cuts are well worth spending the money on the album.  The Run DMC collaboration is just one great reason, you can't find it any where else in the Aerosmith catalogue.
B00004Z459|5.0|&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; has to be one of the best CD's I have bought in a really long time. The Boys of Linkin Park really know how to do it when they put together a CD. With such tracks as &quot;Papercut&quot; &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;In the End&quot; this CD will get you pumped!
0790738139|5.0|As a retired police officer I make it a point to view this movie at least once every year.  The foibles, weaknesses and heroics of officers I knew, and some scenes were dead on, keeps me alert and aware of how difficult, dangerous and frequently dirty police work really is.
6304383177|5.0|I saw Bringing Up Baby for the first time just under a month ago, and have since rewatched it about five times. Not only does it stand up to repeated viewings, it seems almost to *require* them; there's no way to absorb everything at one go. The best part is that the funny bits are just as funny on the sixth viewing as they were on the first, if not even funnier, because you've grown to really love the scatter-brained chatterbox Susan, and the befuddled, confused David.<br />It's impossible to imagine anyone else playing either Susan or David: Hepburn and Grant are perfect for their roles, and their characters are perfect (foils) for each other. Most people would consider Hepburn a dramatic actress, largely because of her later body of work (e.g. The Lion In Winter). But BUB proves she is a dazzling, charming comedienne, well able to go toe-to-toe with the funniest men in the business. Grant is wonderfully generous in allowing her to dominate the movie by playing the straight man, and he does so wonderfully as well.<br />Watch this for Hepburn, watch this for Grant, watch this for Hepburn *and* Grant... and, oh yes, watch it for the leopard. ;)
B00005BJ2O|2.0|You may look at the rating and get the wrong impression -- that I dislike the music in Moulin Rouge. That's not true, the music is great. However, the songs are meant to go with the movie -- without visuals, they're empty. Go pick up the DVD for a better experience
0790743221|5.0|Absolutely brilliant romantic comedy starring three of the best classic movie actors--Hepburn, Grant and Stewart. Hepburn is glorious in her reprisal of the role she played before 455 New York audiences--she flirts, she storms, she babbles in French and gets drunk, all in a wonderfully charming manner. Watching her performance in this film, it's hard to believe that Hepburn ever had a 'box-office poison' period. Still, in giving Tracy Lord life, Tracy Lord not only gave Hepburn back her career, but also allowed movie audiences for generations to come to enjoy the undeniable magic and charisma of Katharine Hepburn.<br />While this film is undeniably Hepburn's, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart also turn in brilliant performances. Grant chose the more low-key role, oddly enough, while insisting on top billing. This left the field open for Stewart to sneak in and try his darned best to steal the movie from Hepburn's capable hands, and he almost succeeded. The chemistry between Hepburn and Stewart is a delight to watch, and I do wonder what Grant could have done with this role if he'd chosen it. Could he have improved on it? Highly doubtful.<br />Peerless romantic comedy; wonderfully, tightly scripted. Eons above its musical remake, 'High Society'.
0385335482|5.0|Rebecca Bloomwood has all the things a university graduate should have, a job, a flat (ok she shares it) and debt.  Not just a little debt, Rebecca, or Bex as her friends call her, has a seemingly evergrowing overdraft on all her credit cards and store accounts.  The calls and letters from her crediters keep getting dodged with ever more clever excuses, and Rebecca discovers it takes more and more retail therapy to help her out of her \\"Is that all ther is?\\" funks. When the letters take on a more persistant tone, and Rebecca's friend takes a job in finance with real pay, Rebecca looks at her job as a writer with \\"Successful Savings\\" magazine and decides to make some changes.  In hopes of making some extra money she send away for some make at home crafts to gbring in extra money, only to find it a disaster.  Even her lists on her good intentioned money saving ideas make you smile.  The weekend trip to the Victoria and Albert Museum (museums are supposed cost free) as a cheap way to have fun, is redeemed by Rebecca's discovery of the museum gift shop and her estatic discription of getting her Christmas shopping done.  Unfortunately, the more Rebecca tries to save, it seems the more she spends, and she is overwhelmed by the mounting debt.  Facing financial disaster she keeps on plugging along, with often hialrious results.<br />  What sets this apart from all the recent British 'singleton' imports is the likability of the heroine.  Not only is Rebecca just like almost anyone we might know ourselves, she is just trying to do her best.  Not obsessed with sex, or weight (although Bridget Jones did those brillantly) she is Everywoman trying to make ends meet.  And when her efforts catch the eye of  Luke Brandon, the owner of a PR firm that often comes in contact with Successful Savings magazine, she is as flustered and disbelieving as any one of us might be.  Sophie Kinsella has managed to capture a fresh take on what has become a formulatic market.  This book is a sheer delight!elight!
B00005RHGK|5.0|THIS MOVIE, WHICH I SAW IN THE THEATRE, DID SCARE THE [STUFFING] OUT OF ME BECAUSE OF THE SCENES THAT HAD THE CAR CHASINGS AND THE DARK ATMOSPHERIC MOOD TO IT. I LIKE IT ALOT AND ITS THE PERFECT HORROR MOVIE, I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO PEOPLE WHO LIKED HALLOWEEN AND THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE SERIES.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Anyone remotely interested in history especially the civil war should see this movie.  It is historically accurate for the most part and is very well made even though it was originally filmed as a made for tv film to be shown on TNT.  I do like that it was shot at the actual battlefield and used reenactors as extras.  If you like history and own a DVD player but do not have this film but it now you will not regret it.
B00000JPH0|5.0|The Winter War is the most historically accurate and realistic war film I have seen.  During the film, we follow the lives of a small group of friends as they find themselves in the frontlines facing a soviet invasion.  All aspects of the movie are well conceived and finely filmed.  The best aspect of the Winter War, however, is the fact that there are no underlying subplots.  Unlike Saving Private Ryan (which I must admit I also thought was excellent), the characters do not spend the movie attempting to accomplish an unlikely (albeit intellectually satisfying) objective.  Rather, the characters try to stay alive, protect their friends, and follow orders as real soldiers might.   <br />Another very compelling aspect of the film is it's historical accuracy.  Tactics and equipment all correspond to those employed by Russia and Finland in 1939.  T-26 tanks, I-16 fighters, and human wave attacks fill out the Russian Arsenal, while the Fins remain on the defensive aside from local counter attacks.  Adding to the realism is the fact that much of movie is filmed in a limited geographic area.  This allows the viewer to become familiar with local terrain features in a way that few other films permit.  Hence, the viewer begins to sense the directions from which attacks might come and beings to get a feeling of what constitutes a \\"Full-scale Attack,\\" a \\"Probe,\\" etc.<br />Overall, I would highly recommend the Winter War to anyone who enjoys war films or who is interested in Military History.  Due to the lack of subplots, however, people simply looking for an action film or for a simple diversion are likely to be disappointed.
6304698658|1.0|What is with the little woman grabbing the &quot;family jewels&quot; of Chevy Chase, at the end of the film?
B00005RYLE|5.0|Well this is the one that you have been waiting for. You couldn't get more in depth with the movie anywhere else. It includes two commentaries with writer and director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert. A fanalysis of the films history and commentary with the one and only (Hail To The King Baby) Bruce Campbell. And still galleries from the film. And think about it, who wouldn't want their own copy of the Book of the Dead? Imagine the possibilities. Scare your neighbors. Impress your friends. Awake the dead from their ancient slumber. (WARNING.. AWAKING THE DEAD COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES OR POSSIBLE DEATH) If your a fan of this series you cant go on living another second without it.
B000005ALN|4.0|For me, this is one of those albums that I will absolutely never tire of. So you didn't think a white boy could sing passionate stately soul music with the best of 'em? Well, you're sadly mistaken. George Michael is an incredibly-underrated singer and musician and he tapped something special when he pieced this fine work together. It was a six-year wait between his greatly-underappreciated 'Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1' and this album, and when it finally dropped there was a lot of skepticism going around about whether he could still deliver. But, the fact is, Michael is a truly gifted singer and musician, who has only grown better and better over time. The songs all have a clear sound and a nice emotional feel, whether it is a slower song or a laid-back groove. The music holds down a nice neutral ground between R&B, jazz, and dance, and he shows true mastery of everything.<br />There is no doubt that this is his most deeply personal and heartfelt songwriting here. Most of the songs are ballads or soft, mid-tempo numbers and Michael pours every bit of emotion he can surmise into these songs. The most somber song on the album is the opening track 'Jesus to a Child', a quiet reflection on love lost and the painful day-by-day struggle to come to grips with it. Interestingly enough, it was chosen as the first single. 'Fastlove' is a bouncy disco number about getting hot and bothered with a girl and getting her in bed for a quickie just for the sake of it (well, that's the vibe I got from it, whoever he wants to get into bed with is his business, na'mean?).  The title track 'Older' is a nice, melancholy number that serves as the album's theme - letting go, moving on, and growing older, as the title suggests. The next song 'Spinning the Wheel' is one I've recently re-discovered due to some relationship troubles I've been going through. The way he words and phrases this number is just perfect to me. Just listen to it. The instrumentation on the song is excellent as well, with a complete horn section over the midtempo percussion and keyboards, it is effortlessly funky, but clean and polished enough to flow well with the album. Next comes one of my favorite songs 'It Doesn't Really Matter', another song coping with the pain of losing your one and only love. With its sparse percussion and organ playing, this is the kind of song I'd like to hear in an after-hours jazz club, going down hard with a shot of whiskey. It has such a laid-back feel and relaxed aura that I wouldn't be surprised if Michael recorded the song while reclining on a couch (something Marvin Gaye was known for doing to create a relaxed atmosphere in the recording studio). The same goes for 'To Be Forgiven' and 'Move On' both songs that concern repentence and redemption, and feature jazz-like instrumentation that border closely on easy listening of the Sinatra standard, except that Michael's voice has so much soul, it stands on it's own. And, in spite of the dour subject matter, both songs (particularly 'Move On') are such catchy, finger-snapping grooves in the basslines and jazzy horn interjections, they could appeal to just about anyone and any mood. Finally, there is 'You Have Been Loved' which basically closes the album and it is one of the most beautifully-written songs on the entire album. I don't know how to explain it except to say that it touches the soul, no matter how ravaged you may feel inside because of the pain of life, there is relief. And there is healing. That's the note this album concludes on: Healing of the mind, body and soul. <br />This album, as well as 'Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1', really opened my eyes to this man's range as a writer, singer, and musician and how much he'd matured musically and grown as an artist since the sex-filled youthful energy of his late '80s work (which I was never a big fan of). Much to my dismay, 'Older' was not well-received by critics or much of the public in the United States when it was first released for reasons I'm not really sure of (aren't most critics arrogant snobs anyways?). Eventually, though, time serves great art. And, the more time goes by, the more this work stands on its own. It's style, class and elegance is something sorely-missing from a lot of singers nowadays. This is by far Michael's best album ever.
B000002MUW|4.0|Musically, this is Madonna at the high of her pre-Ray of Light career. The album contains absolutely no filler, which is what you get from other albums. You want &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; but you get a bunch of junk. You want &quot;Take a Bow,&quot; and you get ten other equally good songs.<br />Highlights include &quot;Inside of Me&quot; (despite being written about Madonna's late mother, it has a great groove,) &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; (the other song on this album featuring Babyface,) and &quot;Secret&quot; (which still gets airplay on soft-rock stations)<br />If you want the best pre-electronica Madonna, or if you're interested in seeing what she's like in &quot;Soul Sista&quot; mode, check out &quot;Bedtime Stories!&quot;
B00005IBGQ|5.0|A wonderful record that only gets better with repeated listenings. &quot;Poses&quot; seems to be a more focused effort than it's predessor, the songs have more of a pop sensibility, while not cheapening the messages in the lyrics. &quot;Greek Song&quot; is a gorgeous song that will haunt your days and nights with is hummable melody and engaging rhythm. A must!
0807282375|5.0|All I can say about this book is that ANYONE who has read the first two has to be absolutely nuts not to read this and anyone who HASN'T read the His Dark Materials trilogy, then I order you to go to your local bookstore. God, this book is awesome!!! Terrific job, Philip Pullman! I could rave on about this for days but I'll only say a few things: If you really love adventure, romance, evilness, and tragedy THIS BOOK IS THE ONE FOR YOU!!!!!!!!! And I'm serious. It's only faults were 1: the scenes with Mrs. Coulter and everything (I found them rather boring) even though the rest of the book is spectacular; and 2: the ending was awful. Sorry, but it was. I'm not saying it should have been that corny happily ever after but it was just so sad that it made me cry (I'm even admitting it) because I had grown to love Lyra and Will and all the other characters that make up this riveting series. I'm not kidding...Otherwise, the book was terrific. I wasn't exactly thrilled about Will and Lyra falling in love because it made the ending so sad but you had to, Philip Pullman, because otherwise the story wouldn't have worked, right? Well, anyway, thank you Phillip Pullman for giving me Lyra and Will and Iorek Byrnison and Serafina Pekkala and all the rest because you introduced me to a whole new world! (No pun intended.)

B00003CXN4|5.0|This movie has three seperate story lines and in order to keep them straight, the director (quite masterfully) uses a different tint for each scene.  The first story is about how the newly-appointed drug czar's daughter is hooked on drugs, the second is set in Mexico and the corruption the \\"war on drugs\\" causes in that country and the third is about a rich housewife who discovers that her husband is mixed up in distributing drugs.<br />Usually, \\"movies with a social message\\" turn me off.  I don't need to be preached to, thank you very much.  This movie was different: it criticized the absurd policies over \\"the war of drugs\\" by showing exactly how these laws effect people.  The scene with Michael Douglas talking with senators (while downing scotch) says it all--the \\"war\\" is about power and money and who cares about the people.  Bottom line: this movie makes you think and is a must see.
078322804X|5.0|I have to start by saying that this is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I love the blues, I love the humor of Akroyd and Belushi, and this is a great combination.<br />Hearing this movie on DVD after numerous times on VHS and cable TV is like going from vinyl to CD.  But at the same time, it shows some of it's warts.  For example, Shake Your Tailfeather has a little bit of surface noise along with the recording.  If you own the soundtrack on CD, it's the same effect but maybe a little more pronounced as compared with the excellent audio quality of the rest of the picture.<br />The extra scenes, in my humble opinion, just don't add all that much to the movie.  If anything, it slows it down.  I can't imagine what this edition might be like if the folks at Universal hadn't thrown away the original negatives.  For all the complaints from Mr. Landis regarding the fact he liked it the way it was originally, it's better cut down.  And no, I don't think that all movies have to be under a certain amount of time to be good (I loved Schindler's List in all of it's 3 hours and 17 minutes).  I wish there was an option to have the original theatrical release play in addition to the added segments.<br />The additional material, while sparse, was very good.  I enjoyed the documentary on the making of the film.  It gave me quite a few good laughs.<br />Overall, in my biased opinion, this easily rates 5 stars, but there was certainly a little room for improvement.

B00005RHGK|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in recent years! Now that Carpenter seems to have lost his touch and Barker his nerve, Salva emerges as a true talent in the genre. I was on the edge of my seat and scared the whole way through as I anxiously awaited to see what was going to happen to our protagonists next. Ignore the negative reviews if you are a true lover of monster movies (old school Universal monsters and Sat. afternoon Creature Features) and run right out and rent or purchase this. The DVD is chock full of extras and well worth the purchase.
B000059XXZ|4.0|The movie \\"Batman\\" is about a wealthy businessman turned cape crusader, Bruce Wyane (Actor Michael Keaton) who witnessed the murder of his parents as a boy.

Will Batman ever be able to save Gatham, or will he fall directly into the Joker's hands?
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is yet another Hollywood \\"film\\" that hasn't the slightest respect for decency or verisimilitude.  Outside of the demented imaginations of liberal pinko prevert screenwriters there is no allusion to contextual rectitude. (Thanks for the commentary guys.)  Let's just take a look at the sordid view of our society that this movie propagates.  They expect us to actually believe in: greedy, amoral, meglomaniacal real estate agents trouncing through suburbia like hyenas in heat; precociously neurotic high school kids swearing, selling drugs to each other and obsessing over forbidden sex; disillusioned, middle-aged men fantasizing about over-sexed, buffed out teenage girls; decent and intelligent gay men trying to get along with their neighbors; fascistic, closet-case marine corps officers abusing their wives and children; and finally, the offspring of decadent, pathologically materialistic, dysfunctional, middle class parents dreaming of a world without hypocrisy and social Darwinist oppression.  I mean, ask yourself, honestly:  IN WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSE DO THESE THINGS HAPPEN?!!!<BR>On second thought, don't ask yourself.  American film has been on the highway to hell ever since Orson Welles threw a fish in the face of wholesomeness in \\"Citizen Kane\\" when he uttered that infamous lewd and suggestive catch phrase, \\"Rosebud.\\"  Movies have been going downhill ever since.
B00005NWM3|4.0|The State is one of the best hard rock albums I have ever heard.  Chad Kroeger's voice is so emotional and the guitars are just raw on that album.  Silver Side Up is like The State pt. 2, and has all the upsides and downsides all sequels have.<br />If this album has one major downfall, it is the over-recycled riffs.  If you listen to Hollywood, then listen to Little Friend (arguably Nickelback's best song, from their Canadian debut Curb), you really hear an uncanny similarity.  the upsides, though, are the raw, bleeding emotion dripping from each song.<br />The album starts with the heavy Never Again, a song about abuse with a piledriver of a chorus, which leads into How You Remind Me, the #1 song in america for months.  The second single, Too Bad, has another kickin' chorus, but isn't what i would have picked for the next single.  i would definately have picked \\"Money Bought,\\" the gem of the album.  with an attitude almost everyone has felt toward someone at some time or other and a chorus that will leave your ears bleeding, your head pounding and your heart racing, it is absolutely amazing.<br />Overall, this is not a bad album, but The State is so much better.  i would highly reccomend The State to fans of hard rock, but Silver Side Up to fans of How You Remind Me.  Or, if you can score a copy of Curb, that would be the way to go.
B00001W9G0|4.0|Movie summary:<BR>Hubbell and Katie meet in highschool where Hubbell is the star athlete who does nothing but hang around with a crowd that like to make fun of things such as poilitics. Katie on the other hand takes everyhing seriously as an ambitious peace keeper who fights for every cause and whilst giving a speech everyone else puts her down yet Hubbell admires her. As the two slowly become friends, she realizes Hubbell's talent of writing and pushes him. When highschool ends the two lead on into the world with their different lives. Hubbell joins the navy and Katie works at a radio station, but the two meet up and slowly Katie rekindles her highschool love for him whilst Hubbell slowly enters the relationship only with high respect for her morals at first, but those morals years later end up destroying their relationship. They even have a daughter but that doesnt help their relationship in any way.<br />The timeline was confusing but the actors were wonderful. Robert Reford gives life to the movie with his good looks and superb acting talent as Barbara Streisand makes the movie more realistic and challenging and the two bring a romance on the screen of how opposites attract.<BR>I didn't take too highly to the ending though, neither one of them is prepared to change their prospectives and even if they try to change the other doesn't accept it. Even though they loved each other all the way to the end they never understood that love is the most important thing in the world not politics or ambitions. It somehow reminded me of a shorter version of The Thorn Birds (Richard Chamberlain and Rachel Ward) where one is ambitious and that causes everything to be destroyed.<br />I had the DVD version and the hour long documentary was without Robert Redford, a shame.
B00000JHAU|3.0|a friend let me borrow a cassette of this a few years ago. it was before the enclave folded. needless to say i got very into it. before long i was singing all the lyrics and listening to it on a daily basis. i bought \\"...arab strap\\" & thought half of it was good. gradually i just stopped paying attention to them. i picked it out to listen to in the car a few weeks ago and i realised how ridiculous it was. his lyrics used to seem great, but now they just seem weak and overthought. that's what happens when people like morrissey too much. they write sissy lyrics that only appeal to smarter more sensitive poor kids and upper crust kids who sucked at sports and try to be cool. it's not bad though.
B0000024ZC|5.0|I've been fleshing out my early 70's prog rock collection, and I started with this disk. I have had Octopus for years and love it. Three Friends is Octopus with a more cohesive presentation. When I got this disk, I popped it in the car player for the commute to work, then took it inside to my office, then back to the car for the ride home, then inside to the home hi-fi. I couldn't get enough. <BR>I love albums that flow well from song to song and make you want to listen the whole way through without skipping a dog or zoning out over a glossy keyboard intro. This album does that for me in a way that only Rush's Moving Pictures and Genesis's Selling England By The Pound can do for me. But I digress. 5 STARS! Prog rockers hit the BUY button now, or search the auctions for this wonerful gem.<br />on a side note, not all of the Giant's stuff is as recommended. Read other reviews (by other people, not me) on The Missing Piece and any album onward. 'Nuff said.
B00005T30L|4.0|Ghsot World is one of those films that many people just will not'get', but if you've ever felt like you not quite in tune with the rest of society, it will really strike a chord.  Excellent performances from Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi, with a razor sharp script.<br />The DVD image is fine, with excellent details and rich colours.  Occasionally there is a hint of grain but this is almost imperceptible.<br />Oh, and by the way: the brilliant 1965 music video 'Jaan Pehechaan Ho' used in the opening sequence is simply the best extra I've ever seen on a DVD.  Period!
0571212689|5.0|As an internet 'designer/developer' i have long been fascinated by motion graphics and the digital arts. However, perhaps much like the majority these days, i was never formally trained: books, the web, my ambition and an aversion to boredom have culminated a competent professional. Much in the same way I have long had an interest in animation, cartoons, comics and the like but without the formal training, a massive workload in recent years and an inner-demon whispering doubts I have never persued this area. Since receiving my copy of ASK, just yesterday, i literally have not put it down. An interesting and fascinating read in the first instance, but a complete tomb of characher motion and discovery as its essence. As a novice-beginner it has opened a massive world of expressive opportunity in user-friendly prose, and exquisite and plentiful drawings. If ever you were looking for a complete reference of charachter movement from beating a rhythm to standing in the wind - you got it here. I'm so excited to carry on with it i've gotta go... As for those negative-demons, well, lets just say they know to keep their mouths shut tight.
B000001FY9|5.0|This was the very first CD of Bob Marley (and Jamaican music, for that matter) that I ever purchased.  I will certainly continue to buy after hearing the amazing quality of Mr. Marley's music.  His songs are among the very best music I've ever heard, from any genre (and I listen to everything from rock to classical to electronic to jazz.)  The fourteen cuts here represent the musical career of a man who has already been immortalized by countless fans everywhere.  I think this is because of the quality of his music and his very positive message.  The music is very political, but not angry or bitter.  He expresses his beliefs poetically and tastefully.  I especially like &quot;Redemption Song&quot; because of the very soulful way Mr. Marley expresses his spiritual and political beliefs.  It is a very profound song.  All of the songs, however, have very good lyrics and a mellow, easy-going pace.  These factors contribute to make this an excellent meditaion CD.  So, if you're just discovering the music of Jamaica (like me), or if you are already a fan, pick up this album. You will not regret it.<br />Bob Marley, thank you for making this great music and touching so many people.
0887306667|5.0|This book mainly talks about \\"Positioning\\". How to position your product so that you can own a place in customer mind? To own a simple word in the prospect's mind that is not used by other companies, to give up some something, to find an opposite and effective attribute¡K¡K The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing will give you a more detailed answer!<br />If you violate these 22 laws, your company will have to bear the risk! Why? As the laws are written based on the concept of \\"Positioning\\", if you cannot position your product well, much money will be wasted on irrelevant areas. There are many important decisions such as pricing, distribution, promotion, advertising that are made based on the position of the product. If the position is unclear, all these decisions cannot be made consistently and thus cannot deliver a consistent image to the customer, making it difficult for customer to put your product in their mind.<br />The book is very clear in the content and format. It brings out a great deal of marketing concept and at the same time clarifies a lot of incorrect concepts people in general have, giving us a clearer picture. Moreover, it divides the 22 laws into 22 chapters. Only by reading the title of that chapter can we easily know what that chapter is talking about.<br />It is also easy to understand. Ries and Trout can illustrate profound marketing concepts in very simple words, with the use of metaphor and real world examples. We can learn a lot from the success and the mistake from these real world applications. Though it is heard that the examples used are not up-to-date, I think it does not really matter as they can help me understand the law a lot.<br />I can say that I enjoy reading this book very much. I can get a lot of insights from it!
B000001DTM|5.0|Next to &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind,&quot; &quot;Actung Baby&quot; is probably U2's best album to date.  This album takes you from the heart-wrenching ballad &quot;One&quot; to the smooth &quot;The Fly.&quot;<br />If you're a rock and roll fan, and you haven't picked *this* album up... SHAME ON YOU!
0060229357|5.0|Yes, I am a 45 year old man writing a review for a children's book, and, no, I do not think that I ought to be ashamed of myself. A short while ago I stumbled upon a copy of this book by accident and I could't believe the flood of warm and pleasant memories that it brought back. This was perhaps my favorite childhood book, along with the sequels. Maybe this was because from my earliest memories I always wanted to be an artist, and that is what Harold was, an artist with a magic purple crayon. He was more than an artist, he was a creator of worlds. That was important, he wasn't presented as a trivial person doing \\"art\\", he was the creative force behind whole new worlds. Or \\"co-creator\\", for he often seemed as surprised as the reader at what flowed out of that crayon. While I didn't become an artist, I did work for most of my life as a draftsman and designer. I've seen many, many things in the real world start life as a drawing on my board or computer screen. I think that I kept faith with Harold....
B0000033IS|5.0|recorded after 7 unfulfilling years at columbia, this atlantic debut offers no hint at the fate that would befall aretha - to be crowned the Queen of Soul; with no hint at abdication either.<br />what this does offer is pure, unadulterated soul that side of the delta, with one track, first recorded by otis redding, (from a male point of view of course) eventually morphing into a female anthem (apart from being aretha's first million seller)- respect - available in mono and stereo versions.<br />THE best soul album ever? couldn't agree with that more...
B000008H24|4.0|Fans of the prog rock side of Tull don't like it because it's not \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or \\"Passion Play\\"; fans of the celtic-acoustic side of Tull don't like it because it's not \\"Songs from the Wood\\" or \\"Heavy Horses\\"; heavy rock fans don't like it because it's not \\"Aqualung\\".  This, combined with the radio success of \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\"--a brilliant piece of music with bizarre lyrics that remains an occasional oddity on classic rock stations--turned off some people to \\"Warchild\\".  However, I truly can't believe there are real Tull fans (or any people, for that matter) out there who think that this is one of the weaker albums in the Tull repertoire:  \\"Warchild\\" is an excellent album.  After two complex concept albums, I think that Ian Anderson was looking for a new direction with the band.  Of course, that's what has kept Tull interesting for all these years.  \\"Warchild\\" was originally intended to be a film (a film ABOUT WHAT has never been made entirely clear, although Rolling Stone at the time reported that Ian was going to play God).  Too bad that never happened.  I think that the plans for a film score are why this album introduces really complex orchestrations (courtesy of David Palmer and the Philamusica of London) along with the songs.  Although Palmer had done orchesteral arrangements for Tull before this album, it was really on \\"Warchild\\" where the orchestra got to sound like part of the band, in a way that no group had done (or has since done).  The running themes in the songs are also intriging--there's war, Britain, interesting ladies, the circus, victory, loss, religion, life, and death.  The whole album seems to laugh at the oddness of the world we have constructed.  However, the best thing about this album is the music:  Listen to the driving guitar and complex percussion of \\"Sealion\\"; the vocal harmonies of \\"Only Solitaire\\"; the overall merriment and musical diversity of \\"Skating Away\\".  There is really nothing else like this album.  (P.S. I took off 1 star because I prefer \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\"--a song intended for \\"Aqualung\\" that was ultimately dropped from the album--to its reworking as \\"Two Fingers\\" on \\"Warchild\\".  A minor point, really.
0440219078|5.0|We got turned on to this book through a teacher's recomendation.  And I have found I tend to like the Newberry Award winners.  This is a very good book for young people who are ready to start wrestling with stories that pose ethical dilemas.  This is not a fairy tale, though, thank Ja, it is fiction.  We got a copy when our eldest daughter was graduating into chapter books.  Since then, each of our children has chosen to read this book on their own.  And, even better, talked with us about the issues it presents to them - issues of free will, responsibility, self sacrifice, choice, determinism.  It allowed us to discuss difficult, sometimes painful choices while holding them at arm's length as you can with fiction.  Still, it is a somewhat dark, disturbing tale.  Not in the almost prurient RL Stine (Stein?) Fear Street way.  More the way a brooding storm slowly, inexonerably moves up on you.  Younger readers may find it too dark.  But I think it is very much worth reading.
0790749815|5.0|Hitchcock was master theorist. The famous crop-duster scene in North By Northwest was designed to show that suspense did not require a black limosine and a dark night on a deserted street corner but, instead, could happen in broad daylight in a cornfield in the middle west.<br />Rear Window exposes another &quot;fallacy&quot;, that extensive dialog is necessary in order to reveal the nature of a story's characters. In the first two minutes of Rear Window, we learn about the protagonist's career and how he came to be laid up in a cast, we learn something of his attitude toward his girl friend, and we learn enough about his 8 neighbors to set the scene for the entire story, without so much as a word of dialog being spoken. He has done, in two minutes, what some authors and directors could only do in two hours. <br />My one disappointment with this film was with the ending, which the studio forced him to modify. In the original screenplay, Thorwald's guilt was not the issue. His confrontation with Jeffries (Stewart) was a response to the harrassment he was experiencing due to Jeffries' suspicion of his guilt. Thorwald is driven to attack Jeffries because Jeffries refuses to leave him alone. Hollywood forced Hitchcock to make Thorwald's guilt a certainty, thereby reducing the poignancy of this story, which is the degree to which our belief in what we THINK we know can damage and destroy ourselves, and others.<br />As with many of his later films, Hitchock employs humor to obscure the fact that there is a serious message underlying the story. But like most &quot;jokes&quot; the humor is derived from something much more serious and unfunny.
0792838068|4.0|Nicholas Cage's character, Ben Sanderson, has apparently lost his wife, family, and job. He decides to take his severance check and buy tons of alcohol in order to drink himself to death in a Las Vegas motel room. He meets Sera (Elizabeth Shue), a prostitute that he picks up along the way, and they develop a love affair in the process. Sera's love for Ben is reflected in the way she lets him complete his goal. He wants death and no rehabilitation. As a result, she sacrifices herself in prostitution in order to make ends meet and raise money for Ben's booze habit. In the process, Sera meets some terrible experiences, which makes her character more interesting.  <br />DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES and THE LOST WEEKEND may have an edge on this movie because they have characters that grow and develop over a long period of time. There is not much that we know about Ben or Sera. All we see are his momments of drunkeness and Sera's trying to cope with it. There is very little room for character development in this movie, and the end result is a depressing atmosphere.<br />Pros: Acting<BR>Cons: Screenplay<br />Score: 74 (out of 100)

B00005U1YO|5.0|After reading several reviews which all (ironically) imply that this album is repetitive, I had to step in.  I've been a Chem fan from the start - this is their best yet.  Call it \\"big-beat\\" (especially if you're a pro. critic...), electronica, whatever - this album is all adrenaline and goosebumps.  This'll be the perfect album to crank up once the spring sun shines again.
B00005AQE8|4.0|I remember when this album first came out in 1996: Dang, another 2Pac album? Man, I'm still trippin' over \\"It Ain't Easy\\" from his Me Against the World! Usually, when rappers release an album less than a year after their last album drops, it's weak. This wasn't really the case for Pac though.<br />All Eyez On Me starts off with a bang. \\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\\" has Daz dropping a catchy piano riff as Pac's flows show people that he feels right at home with his new Death Row family. Speaking of family, he wastes no time promoting his new family, because they are all over the album: Dre on \\"California Love\\", Snoop on \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\", Daz and Kurupt on \\"Got My Mind Made Up\\" which also features Method Man and Redman. While we're speaking of ol' Meth, 2Pac uses his opening line from \\"Bring the Pain\\" to create the chorus of the album's highlight, \\"No More Pain\\". Even filler like \\"What'z Ya Phone #\\" can make you nod your head.<br />Well, that's the end of an almost flawless Disc 1. Thirsty for more? Well, unfortunately, Disc 2 may still leave you thirsty. Like on so many double albums that followed this one, there's a lot of aiight tracks that surround the doper ones. \\"Can't C Me\\" sounds like a prolonged funkfest that didn't make Dre's \\"The Chronic\\" album, \\"Thug Passion\\" is where the \\"Computer Love\\" music is sampled for the umpteenth time while Pac and the gang drop some rusted jewels, and virtually every other song features okay lyrics over played-out samples.<br />This album would really be a classic if 2Pac only released Disc 1. He should have used the \\"less is more\\" approach, but you can't blame him: he just got out of jail around that time and dived head first into Death Row Records, and he just wanted to show his best work. And it's not like Disc 2 is wack, it's just that he sounds exhausted on this disc after putting in his all on Disc 1. Oh well. Though Me Against the World remains Pac's best work, All Eyez On Me has enough memorable moments to keep you bumpin' this album until it's time to replace your speakers. R.I.P. Pac
6305922756|4.0|I'm disappointed that Christopher Guest, being the brilliant director that he is, has only made 3 major movies in his long career.  This one, Waiting for Guffman, and Best in Show.  Owning both of the latter movies, i decided to rent the one that started it all.  And while it was funny, and was a brilliant directoral debut and a groundbreaking movie for the new genre in 1984, this one doenst measure up to his other movies.  Its a cult classic, and i can see why.  Its that certain type of humor that some think is hilarious, and some just dont get.  There small chuckles throughout the movie, like when they are describing their anti-femenist album cover, and some great moments where i almost laughed until i cried- like when they had the 18 INCH stone display on the stage, and when they were in those bubble things and one of the guitarists couldnt get out.  Im laughing out loud just thinking about it now.  But do yourself a favor and rent this- even if you dont like it, just to say that you have seen it.  Its less than 90 minutes long, so even if you dont like it its not too overbearing.
0790749815|5.0|Most of Hitchcock's films deal with the notion of identity, whether it be mistaken identity or the pathological desire of a person to make someone into someone else. In Vertigo, obsessive love (and desire to be loved) led to the loss of a woman's identity with disastrous consequences.<br />In North By Northwest, the twist is not someone who turns out to be someone else, but someone who has no identity except that which is adventageous to him. \\"Maggie,\\" as Thornhill (Grant) puts it, \\"in advertising there is no such thing as a lie; only the expedient exaggeration\\". This is the crux of the story and before the first 15 minutes of the picture is over, Thornhill will become a man (who never existed) in order to establish that he is not that man. Ironically, and unbeknowst to him, by doing this he is simply undercutting what could have been his sole defense.<br />In essence, Thornhill is doing what children will often do (after making a similar misjudgement) which is to lie rather than own up to the truth because (as Grant will say in 'Charade') \\"they want something and they are afraid that the truth won't get it for them.\\" The mistake children make is not understanding the more advanced real world experience of their parents that make the flaws in the story immediately apparent.<BR>Thornhill makes the same misjudgement.<br />Most of us don't really believe that prentending to be someone else is the way to achieve a desirable end. But Hitchock creates a situation in which we find ourselves accepting it, as improbably as it may seem. After all, doesn't Thornhill have friends who can vouch for his identity? Wouldn't the proper investigation of the death of Townsend (and the identifty of Kaplan) ultimately reveal the complicity of the housekeeper and the gardener? Of course. In the real world, the absurdity of the events would have become apparent in a matter of days, without the need for Thornhill to ever leave New York.<br />But, in fact, he does leave (and, in so doing, undercuts his own defense). His motivation is derived from his experience as an advertiser (illusionist). If he can make \\"people buy things they don't need\\" then, he is arguing, the public could very well be duped by someone with a more sinister motive. In essence, Thornhill has come to distrust his fellow man precisely because he realizes how easy it is to lie to them. His experience in the courtroom when he tries to tell the truth only reinforces this view. His only weapon is his ability to lie, so much so that he is actually able to dupe the Professor, who created the entire scenario (not for \\"our amusement\\" the Professor protests), by pretending to be honest.<br />Authors have argued that Hitchock was a misogynist, but North By Northwest is more than misogynistic. It is cunningly misanthropic. As Van Dam's character says, \\"you make this very room a theatre\\". In North By Northwest, most people are fools, blindly accepting what they see at face value, while all around them is actually being played out a sinister battle between good and evil. The \\"truth\\" is nothing more than what it is these players want us to believe. If Hitchcock had tried to make that point in a serious movie (like \\"Manchurian Candidate\\") it would have likely been dismissed. How much cleverer to play it as ironic humor.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is one of those easy-to-listen to-all-the-way-through kind of albums, which are hard to come by to begin with, but in addition, there are a few true gems, such as \\"Why Georgia\\" and \\"3x5.\\"  For anyone who is a Dave Matthews fan (yes, he sounds a lot like him) and/or looking for some new singer/songwriter tunes, this CD is a terrific investment.  And I can't wait to see what Mr. Mayer has for us next.

0525946284|4.0|...because you won't want to put it down until you are done.  Follett's Jackdaws is an exciting read from the first page to the last.  Sure, some of it may be implausible, but it's a thrilling ride.  Follett builds suspense by trading viewpoints between the Nazi, Dieter, in charge of finding the British spies in France; and with Flick, the lovely British spy who has led numerous groups of French resistance for years.  Flick's challenge is enormous: in a day she needs to find a team of women in Britain who can speak French fluently, and possess the qualities she needs to blow up a telephone exchange.  It's almost like \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" but with a female cast.  Dieter is one of the greatest villains I've ever read about, unfortunately his atrocities are based in fact.  Dieter pulls out all the stops to capture Flick and her group of spies.  If you like WW2 stories and espionage thrillers, don't miss this one.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Not much I can say that everyone else hasn't. It's a great album all the way! Musically tight and fast, lyrically beautiful. Dream Theater shows us with every new album that they can still cut new paths and are without comparison when it comes to pure musicianship. Only thing I have to say is that the Floyd similarities everyone is hyping really aren't that strong... I'm sorry but I love Floyd and there's not an album of theirs I don't have but these songs still sound nothing like them. &quot;The Great Debate&quot; which is one of DT's best seems to be pointed to a lot as Toolish. This might be true if Tool was worth ripping off. Strange but DT started making this style first and the song really sounds very Awakeish and no more Tool like then SFAM... If anything one should say that Tool ripped DT off they did it first and as always a lot better. Maybe if Tool had the talent to pull off what DT was and a lyricist that could write in a higher degree then a 2 year old they could write a song like this but till then... The title track is great the entire way though. For some strange reason they sliced it up when they set it to disk. It's one whole song with no breaks however the cutting makes it easier for the CD player still as the disk says it's a solid 42 min of musical bliss and a must hear for any music fan prog or otherwise.
0380973650|5.0|Simply put, this story is amazing.  The characters are likable, the situations are both extreme and believable and the concept is unique.<br />If you are a fan of Gaiman, pick this up.  If you are not, pick this book up, it will change your feelings.<br />I don't want to write about the concept of the story, because IMO it could easily ruin the surprises this book will give you.<br />BUY THIS BOOK!
B000002ADT|5.0|The CD came in the mail yesterday. I listened to it last night - three times. It's perfect.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I was wowed by this album.  It is so awesome.  I have her first album, Can't Take Me Home, which I really did not dig.  The songs were good, but it did not appeal to me.  It did not feel like Pink was putting her soul into it.  But in Missundazstood she totally puts her all into this.  I was happy that she had a lot of creative control over this album, got decent producers, and wrote most of the material.  I was also pleased at the diverse content in the songs. I usually get tired of hearing songs just about love. \\"Family Portrait\\" talks about family problems. \\"Missundazstood\\", \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\", and \\"Lonely Girl\\" deal with finding yourself and who you are. \\"My Vietnam\\" is one of my favorites because it is really original...I've heard nothing like it before...I like the background music a lot.  \\"18 wheeler\\" is a song about just getting up and letting nothing knock you down.  \\"Respect\\" is a hilarious song, but it has a good message for girls to make sure that they get good treatment from guys.  \\"Dear Diary\\", \\"Eventually\\", and \\"Numb\\" show P!nk's vulnerablity and how she turned herself around.  \\"Gone to California\\" is slow but it is just awesome...the title explains itself...sounds very r'n'b.  I think P!nk's sound now is pop going into a direction of rock/alternative.  She shows her personality very well in this album.  Her voice has never sounded better and her lyrics are honest.
B00004WG2X|2.0|Don't waste your money.  Spend a few extra dollars and buy the more recent A&amp;E version.  This version looks as if it was made in someone's basement.  The production values are nil and the acting is wooden.  There are a few nice moments toward the end, and if there were no other version available, I might recommend it  more.  The A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, is superb.  I  especially recommend the DVD with a featurette on the making of Pride and Predjudice.
B00005MP58|5.0|It's hard to find enough good things to say about this production.  The actors were excellent.  The design was perfect, and fitted the whole production well.  It was entertaining, even to sit down and watch the whole thing at once.  And most important, it was true to both the substance and the spirit of Jane Austen's original novel.<br />No adaptation of any kind will ever be completely faithful.  No matter how much effort is put into staying true to the original, some elements must be added or taken away to better suit the new medium.  The trick lies in doing so in a way that adds to, rather than detracts from, the original.  And boy, is this a great adaptation!
0060926317|5.0|It's the only fiction about aboriginal life in Australia I've ever found, so it's hard to compare it to anything else, but I loved this book!

0451196716|2.0|Richard Bachman's OK, I guess, but he's no Stephen King.  At least, not here.  I was actually quite shocked at how shallow this book was -- King's tales are usually multi-layed wonders with unexpected twists and turns, but &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is so one-dimensional and underdeveloped that I had to keep glancing at the cover to make sure I hadn't picked up the wrong book by mistake.  And don't even get me started on the ending, which is so graceless and sudden that it left me feeling like an amputee.  Skip this one, kids....
B00003CX5P|5.0|My five star review is mainly for the DVD of Episode I.(The movie itself I would give a solid 3 1/2-no,I don't hate it the way some do)<BR>The picture is very good(in my opinion anyway,I'm not an expert-but I've read some reviews to the contrary),and the 5.1 Dolby sound is simply amazing,with sound filling the entire room.<BR>The bonus materials on the 2nd disc are very entertaining.They include trailers,featurettes and a lot more,plus a VERY interesting documentary(it's actually more of a video diary) about the making of the film.<br />Overall a great DVD release,and even those who absolutely despise the film should be able to find something entertaining here.<BR>Having said that,PLEASE give us the original trilogy on DVD,George!!!!

B00005RDSM|4.0|I remember loving Peter Pan as a child.  As an adult I purchased the DVD for my children.  The scenes with &quot;Following the Leader,&quot; and the scenes in the nursery are classic Disney.  I also have a new respect for how creative the animation was for the time when it was created.  <BR>I would recommend this Disney film, but as an adult, I noticed things that deterred from movie. I still enjoy the movie, but I cringe at the depiction of the females of this film being nothing more than frivolous beauties with nothing to do other than fight over a non-pubescent boy. (There evidently was not a female writer on staff!) I also have trouble with the Indian portrayal.  I can't decide whether Disney is poking fun at the way Caucasians perceived Native Americans, or if the writers were typical of their time period.
6302250269|4.0|THELMA AND LOUISE is a great movie about two women who set out on a weekend vacation, but end up becoming two fugitives on the run across the American southwest. The acting is wonderful. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have never had finer performances and the supporting &#34;male&#34; cast does just as fine a job (not only was this the film that made Brad Pitt a star, this also was the movie that jump-started Harvey Keitel's career). After his success with ALIEN, Ridley Scott made a few lackluster films before striking the goldmine again with THELMA AND LOUISE. Just about everything he did with the movie illustrates how talented of a filmmaker he is, from the vista views to the soundtrack to the casting to the closing scene.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with all the wonderful things about the film, the movie is simply a buddy flick, but with women instead of men. A buddy flick about two women had really never quite been done before and the film did cause some controversy. It is also true that the film touches upon broad topics and social issues such as rape, justice, and what it means to be free (freedom always comes with a price tag). The film also has a great soundtrack and some awesome visuals of the American southwest. Still when you drain the memorable melodies and take all the pretty pictures away, the film remains at the core as simply just another buddy flick. A really good buddy flick, but a buddy flick nonetheless.

I totally didn't get it?!?! why did she have to lip synch every single damn song... that got so annoying...  Iknow it's harder for her to sing since she dances, but I know alot of people who can dance and sing at the same time!  And what's this whole thing about trying to make a \\"Young britney and sexy britney\\"?? she is such a contradiction!! Not to mention the in-between-song skits... like the hippy section... what the heck was that all about?  I admit I do like some of britneys songs and it seems she does have a good personality, but this concert is not one of her best... I had to stop it before the end of the concert... cuz I was getting a britney headache.... MY TWO CENTS.. You may now attack....
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I loved \\"Memento\\" the first time I saw it in the theater, and I was looking forward to getting the DVD to watch it reverse chronology, or the \\"right\\" way. But when I tried to program my DVD player to do this, I found it was impossible: The black and white scenes aren't separated out from the color, so you can't program them separately. And since the black-and-white scenes are in forward chronology while the color scenes are in reverse, well, there's just no way to do it correctly.<br />Then again, I'm pretty new to the DVD world, and maybe I'm missing something here. Does anyone have any pointers on how to program the DVD's 19 scenes so I can watch it in the reverse order? From what I can tell it can't be done, but maybe I'm off...
B00001SIES|5.0|Muse are not 'pale imitations' of radiohead. Matthew Bellamy does not sound like Thom Yorke. Why do we have to compare muse to radiohead. Maybe you can hear hints of radiohead, but just look at the music in its own right. Muse's debut is fantastic. A sincere album which actually has some feeling. Which is unusual with the music industry at the moment. Every song is an epic with anthem like choruses. 'Muscle Museum'the lyrics sneered by Matthew Bellamy. with one of the greatest intros of all time. 'Uno' is a chant of a song. This is not a happy album by any means and if u want cheering up, don't buy it. Most of the songs sound bitter. 'Falling Down' is beautiful, a break from the heavier guitars in most of their songs. Unintended actually sees an acoustic guitar come into hand. It's a wonderful album and a nice change from the tide of macho nu-metal bands. Matthew Bellamy with his sweeping voice and guitar acrobatics. It is a must have for any self respecting rock fan.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This CD is amazing. The vocals are very unique and beautiful, which is something you wouldn't expect on a metal CD at all, the lyrics are like the words of a fairy tale (the band is inspired by the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and it shows!), and the guitar riffs are excellent. &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot; has to be one of the best CDs of the genre on the entire planet. Check it out. You won't be sorry.
020161622X|5.0|An outstanding book, discussing every aspect of programming that has impact on the final product. Skilled programmers have an underlying basis for most everything they do, and rarely does a book summarize this reasoned approach. While I didn't agree with every idea (using a single editor for code, documents, etc.) and some ideas could have been better flushed out (the discussion on blackboards and a workflow rules engine), the book is invaluable. Two other pluses - the ancedotes are great, and the humor is actually humorous.

But here is what I saw:<br />A woman comes to stay at a house by the lake.<BR>She gets raped<BR>She seeks revenge<BR>The end.<br />If I look it from a horror perspective then yes it certainly has the gore and terror we all expect in a standard horror. The deaths are all done within about 15 minutes, which leaves just over an hour to get bored and lose interest. <br />This movie may have been more entertaining if the story was more padded out and had more of a back story. We don't know anything about the people in it, they are just thrown into a situation and there you have it...a pointless story. For example in a horror you often get told why the killer is murdering teens - he doesn't just turn up and kill people for no reason.<BR>I guess if your into classic banned nastys - you may like it because its so outrageous but I just couldn't get anything from it...it was pointless.
B000031XCR|5.0|As all her other CD's are beautiful, this one is too. I've had this CD since last February 2001. And I love it more now than I did back in February. There are 9 past songs and 7 new ones. Although there are some missing songs like her hit song from her second English-Language Album \\"Celine Dion\\" called \\"Nothing Broken But My Heart\\" , and her song \\"Call The Man\\" which is one of my favorites. Last but not least her song \\"(If There Was) Any Other Way\\" (Ohhh Yaaaa) and her song \\"I Love You, Goodbye\\". But it is hard to put so much songs on only half of this CD!!! But this is still a good CD to have and to listen to. But if any of yall say which songs should've been added (Like I just did) then buy her past albums instead, cos I did and all I need is her Unison album in the English albums now. I even have all 3 of her French Albums, which are The French Album (1995), S'il Suffisait D'Aimer (1998), and Dion Chante Plamondon (1991). The're all wonderful albums. Anyways my favorite songs on the \\"All The Way\\" CD are \\"That's The Way It Is\\" , \\"If These Walls Could Talk\\" , and \\"Then You Look At Me\\"!!! Please buy this CD today, if you love Celine. CELINE YOU RULE, YOU ARE THE BEST SINGER!!!
0451527712|3.0|Frankenstein was a pretty good book. It was about a guy named Frankenstein who created a monster using dead parrs of dead people. The book was semi-interesting as the story went along. In the beginning, I found the book to be very dry and boring. As the book went more along, I found that it got interesting. There were things in the book that I was not expecting to happen. You always here these stories about Frankenstein that did not happen in the book. As I was reading the book, I was a little shock at what was happening in the story. When the monster was coming to life, I was expecting something more than all of sudden he is alive. I thought the part about when the monster, whose name is not even Frankenstein which was another shock, was watching after the family for all those days. He was only trying to look out after the family and the children. The only part of the book that I disagreed with was how all the humans were treating the monster. He was only trying to find a friend. On the other hand if I saw a monster on the streets, I would probably run the other way. The book definitely brought out the issue of racism. Another issue in the book that was definitely gross was the thought of Frankenstein and Elizabeth falling in love with each other. Also, how she brought these feelings out that he had for his mother. Another part was when Elizabeth was murdered. You could see that coming. Why Frankenstein did not stop the monster from committing this crime blows me away. Overall, the book was not bad. I gave the book a three because it was not the greatest book I ever read but it was an interesting  book.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I didn't think it possible that songs like this could still be written. McCartney, Dylan, Jagger/Richards, only seem to be able to echo their past greatness; perhaps because they never left it. Then, from out of nowhere, barely to be seen in a dark corner with a keyboard, drum machine and a couple of backup singers, an aged, husky-voiced man is \\"back down from the mountain\\" with the Essence fully intact--a miracle? A Prophecy? A message from the Enlightened One? Try all that plus great, perhaps his greatest, sonwriting ever and you have \\"Ten New Songs\\" by Leonard Cohen. Anybody who knows truly great songwring is drooling over these songs right now, and hopefully learning every note.
B00001PE4D|5.0|The title says it all!! Cruel Intentions has a great story and an even better cast. Its non stop seduction from beginning to end! A triangle of love and hate goes out of control.<BR>Here is our web of destruction:<br />Sarah Michelle Gellar as Kathryn - she is evil, seductive and knows exactly how to create problems. She is very open with her sexuality. The one thing she craves in her life is step brother Sebastian. Will she get what she wants? or will her plans for revenge land her all alone?<br />Meet Ryan Phillepe as Sebastian - a smooth, sexy guy with money, girls and a passion for someone he can't have...Kathryn. Will he win the bet and get Kathryn as well?<br />Reese Witherspoon as Annette - the virginal girl who meets Sebastian and is plunged into a world of love and lies. Will she give into the charms of Sebastian? or will she find out the real reason behind his kindness?<br />Selma Blair as Cecile - a inexperienced school girl who is pretty clueless. But one day meets Sebastian and that all becomes a thing of the past. Will Cecile regret meeting Kathryn? Will she get dragged more deeper into Kathryns world than she'd like?<br />Kathryn can be wicked and controlling. She manages to have Sebastian eating out of her hand. The relationship between them both is full of jealousy, sexual cravings and at times bitterness. <BR>A wicked cocktail of fun. You will simply not be able to resist this movie!!
B000002UDB|5.0|1967 was the Beatles vintage year. Much of the credit goes to Sergent peppers, but the 4 best songs in 1967 ( Hello Goodbye, Penny lane, Strawberry Fields Forrever and All You Need Is Love) came from Magical Mystery Tour.<br />Don't be fooled by the crazy cd cover. MMT has the best of John and Paul. It has songs about Johns childhood(Penny lane, Strawberry Fields), Crazy physodlic songs ( I am the Walrus, Blue Jay Way) song concering their era ( All You Need Is Love and Baby Your A Rich Man) and best of all the song of opposites Hello Goodbye.<br />The movie was absolutey awful so stay away but the music is great. <br />It might not be the best movie but the soundtrack includes 7 songs that made it on the blue album (the Beatles best songs if you didn't know) so its defintely worth the money.<br />A must for Beatles fans
B00005JKQX|5.0|Half way through the movie my mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner said to me: \\"Flange yellow but not before seven Romulan sideboard.\\" Had a disgruntled member of staff doctored the popcorn? We had already got off to an inauspicious start on the way to the cinema when the afore-mentioned Mr Turner told me he was in therapy over a desire to travel to Australia and steal Russell Crowe's gym shorts, immediately after use. What is this, stalkers not-so-anonymous? There are things one would rather not know or speculate about, such as nicknames. Mr Crowe does have a growing fan base now, so one should not be surprised by such fevered fan obsessions. It is a comman affliction of modern industrial societies without heroic role models. Perhaps aware of this, Mr Crowe has decided to broaden his range from a dour long face to a dour long face with a medical condition. We applaud this leap across the Grand Canyon of thespianism. Paranoid schizophrenia is a sadly ignored topic on the big screen although many of us are simply paranoid. I was convinced that the usher was French. It was the onions around the shoulders and spiral moustache. After we sat down, Nigel 'spunky' Turner insisted to me that I was panicking over nothing as he had not seen anything of the sort. This is before he had touched the popcorn so I was a touch worried. Had the thought of seeing Jennifer Connelly in yet another T-shirt temporarily unhinged me? I was certainly going to complain to the managment about Mr Turner's condition although it would be hard to prove foul play due to Nigel's already well advanced pathological inability to tell truth from fiction. When we saw 'Fight Club' together the journey to the bus stop afterwards was the most frightening seven minutes of my life. Perhaps it's a blessing then that this film decided to leave out the toilet incident depicted in the book. Either way, I decided to keep shtum. The film is directed by Ron 'Happy Days' Howard. Towards the end, my mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner turned to me and said: \\"This film, it ends.\\" Glad to see you're back to your old self, old chap. Didn't have the heart to tell him about the Prince of Wales balancing on his head in a ballet tutu. With mental illness, a recovery for 'spunky' was always going to be a matter of degrees.
B000005S6B|5.0|This is a unique piece of work. It is Irish, folky, punk, poetic, rocking, universal. It is hard to understand each sung word because many of the songs race along at break-neck speed and are sung by people with heavy accents, and dubious sobriety. You know what? That doesn't even matter. One is swept away by the glorious sense of fun which leaps from the disc. The &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; number with guest vocalist Kristy McColl (alas, no longer alive) is worth the purchase price all by itself, and in that one, the diction is just fine. It is one of the best songs and performances I've heard in more than 50 years of listening. I learn from reading the reviews of the other 39 fans who got to this item ahead of me that one can only buy this via Import now...there is no cheaper, U.S.-manufactured disc available. That is incredible. I've heard three other Pogues releases, and this is the most memorable.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I had already heard every song on the CD in MP3 form when I got the notion to go out and buy this album. Even though I had heard all the songs and enjoyed nearly every one I was hesitant to buy the CD because I felt that there was something missing. So I held off from the purchase and took a few days to listened hard to all the songs. I just couldn't put my finger on what was missing.<br />Was there something wrong with the Radiohead sound? No, I knew then Radiohead's style was remarkable. Their most recognizable attribute is the schitzofrenic paranoia in their sound and in their singer Thom Yorke's voice. The band knows exactly how to plummet the listener into melancholy depression and then throw in the kind of joyous hooks that help to rise above the despair.<br />Was there something wrong with the Radiohead message? No, the lyrics of each song fit perfectly with the music, bringing about a feeling of exhuberant bliss coupled with the aforementioned melancholy depression. In my mind, Thom Yorke's words ring far truer than almost any other artist's ever.<br />So, &quot;what's the problem?&quot;, I kept asking myself. Reply: &quot;Aw, screw it.&quot; I went ahead and bought the album. And that's when I discovered the what the problem had been.<br />I hadn't heard the whole album as a whole. I had never sat down and listened to the songs in the correct order. The songs that I thought merely amazing before suddenly became astonishing. The whole album flows absolutely perfectly. It's clear that the band meant it to be that way. &quot;Ok Computer&quot; now sits in the &quot;favorites&quot; section of my CD collection and will more than likely be there for a long time, maybe forever.
0618153977|3.0|I just thought that this trilogy overly comsumed by words. it was a novel that could have been about three-hundred pages shorter in retrospect. I finished the book, out of determation and interest in it, but found that At times I didn't think I'd ever get through it... the movies were the big thing that made  interested me enough to finally reading it. Outside of four years of three of my best friends Raving almost daily, over their love of this book.  Although I do get into Fanasy, I just like more the ainti-hero Novels more. All in all, it was a good book, wordy yes, but I can't take anything away from it's statius as a classic.
B000051VWW|5.0|While the spare, almost naked sounding production may put off devotee's of her lush, earlier work, this newly re-formed and inspired Sade is certain to grow on listeners and deepen with further listening. &quot;King Of Sorrow&quot; already sounds like a classic and is destined to become a standard in her repetiore. I do, however, kind of miss Stuart Matthewman's seductive sax stylings on most of these cuts, but on the whole, &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; is a very satisfying listen and a welcome additon to one of the greatest catalogues in pop music.
B00005QCVT|4.0|Never before in a film have I ever cried.  In this film, however, in the end I burst out crying.  It is because the film is true to what is really out there and so depressing. <BR>   The story revolves around 4 characters.  Ellen Burstyn plays a TV obsessed woman who gets her chance of fame.  She got a call giving her a chance to be a contestant on her TV show.  She wants to wear a special dress but can't fit in it.  So she loses weight by speed.  But soon she gets addicted with it.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans play 2 drug dealing friends.  And Jennifer Connoly plays Jared Leto's drug addicted girlfriend, who is getting into prostitution.<BR>   The story just gets darker and darker.  In the end there is no happy ending.  There is not a ending where you get the hint that everything can be okay.  For once, we get a theme that when we realize our mistakes sometimes we might just be deep to get out.  <BR>    Watch this movie.  But be warned that you will leave feeling very depressed and will cry even after the credits are done with.  <BR>Bottom Line:  Great movie but tough to watch.
B000002TYX|5.0|Good CD.  This shows you there early stuff and also the other two.  I was amazed that they made two new songs, Free as a Bird and Real Love and I'm sure every Beatles fan was thrilled when they made those two new songs.  Too bad I wasn't around when The Beatles were around in the 60's and also John Lennon's death.
B00005U1YO|4.0|Bound by the whims of dance culture trends, last months hot electronica is cold as fish today.  The best acts have either ignored convention completely (Roni Size), gone proudly disco (Basement Jaxx), or created compelling, fresh rhythmic forms (the glorious Spring Heel Jack).  The Chemical Brothers have made substantial records (1995's Exit Planet Dust holds up remarkably well), but were on the way to obscurity with the dull Surrender.  On Come with Us, the good news is that they're no longer concerned with Next Big Thing status, or DOR songform.  They go off on a trance-induced bender, freeing their freaky muse to wander where it wants, and come up aces with these predominantly instrumental tracks.  What strikes your fancy is your own business - I get a thrill out of the liquid \\"Hoops\\", the \\"Tubular Bells\\"-redux of \\"My Elastic Eye\\", and - oh yes yes yes - the symphony for cowbell called \\"Denmark\\".
0385486804|5.0|A Great Adventure Story. Carpe Diem.  I discovered &quot;Into the Wild&quot; while writing &quot;Discovering Denali&quot;, a reference book to Denali National Park in Alaska. I once took six months from life and toured the country by motorcycle and could relate very well to Chris McCandless. But, if you ever wondered what it's really like to live in the wild, read this book. He led an amazing life while wandering from place to place. To hear from those who were touched by Chris' extraordinary qualities was also very moving. The story had a sad ending, but few people have experience life like Chris did.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|Call it fate, call it luck, call it Karma, I believe that this film was ment to be on DVD.<BR>A fantastic film made only better by some great interactive menus and fun extras.<BR>If you get the oppurtunity, watch this DVD with the commentary with Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman, and...(Im sorry but I cant remember the third person. Director of photography I think.) Anyway.. This commentary was almost funnier than the movie itself.<BR>The other special features were just as fun. The deleted scenes  do make you realize how important Editors are. Really not funny or interesting stuff there. Still fun to see.<BR>Visually the DVD looks stunning! Very crisp and pleasing to watch. Ditto on the sound. At the time I watched this I had not hooked up my surround sound. Once I get everything plugged in I will have to rewatch it.
B000002B7M|5.0|5 words: Crazy Train and Mr. Crowling
B00005JKHP|5.0|I never cared for &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;. It was dated,long and boring. The special effects were pretty much a big &quot;Ohhh! Look what we can do!&quot;<BR>Then I took this DVD home.<BR>This directors cut was outstanding! It takes a very mediocre film and creates a interesting, creative and most importantly WATCHABLE movie! All of the scenes that previously left a bad taste in my mouth have been either deleted, reedited or remastered.<BR>The special features available on the two disc's are interesting if not enjoyable. The text commentary by Mike Okuda was a particular favorite of mine. Lots of Trek history, backstories, and trivia.<BR>You still have to be fan of the series to enjoy this film but thanks to this remastered edition you can be a fan who only has to try and forget Star Trek 5.(Do you think they can salvage that one?)
B000002MU3|4.0|REM are notoriously one of those bands that have a great formula, but don't tend to vary it much. Well, if Monster were better known, that perception might well change. While not as quintessential as Automatic, relentlessly optimistic as Out of Time or experimental as Up, Monster is an interesting record. Tracks like opener What's the Frequency, Kenneth with its driving powerchords, Crush With Eyeliner, with it's quirky rhythms, Let Me In with its Nirvana influence and Circus Envy with it's metallic ending demonstrate REM's ability to go rock, whilst Strange Currencies and Tongue stay true to vintage REM. Some critisised REM for this change in direction, but it clearly, important marks a necessary respite from a formula, that, while generally very good, could grow tiresome on some albums like the much over-rated Green.
6304698623|5.0|After watching this again recently w/ a friend, its status as a sheer masterpiece of cinema has been cemented in my mind.  All of the elements are flawless - it has great tech stuff like music, production design, & editing as well as an excellent script, a heart-warming/breaking story and amazing performances (Liesel Matthews makes the best debut for a pre-teen actress this side of Natale Portman in 'Leon').   <br />      I know many people have pointed this out, but the imagery in this film is incredibly, incredibly gorgeous.  Every scene is glorious to look at, esp. Sarah's b-day party and the 'breakfast' surprise, as well as all the 'India' sequences...  Cuaron has a great eye and I'm dying to see his next film, Y Tu Mama Tambien, as well as his Great Expectations.<br />      Even if you don't have kids or aren't much into these types of films, I would still recommend taking a look @ this one.
B00005QK3B|5.0|This habit of mine often led to regret, but not this time!! I went on to buy 4 other Marillion records and replaced three of them in CD form (Jester's Tear, Fugazi, and Childhood). These three albums form a trilogy with Misplaced Childhood being the conclusion. It is the best Marillion album I have heard, and one of the best prog rock albums in my opinion (I have every Rush album, about ten Yes albums, four King Crimson albums, and three Genesis to mention a few).  I stopped following Marillion when they released a disappointing (in my opinion) album without Fish. I won't compare the singing talents of Fish and his replacement, but I will say that the lyricism of Fish made early Marillion records far superior to the newer stuff (~1989 on).<br />I had the pleasure of seeing Marillion at the Filmore West (San Francisco)...that show blew me away.  It was an incredible production blending stage-drama and rock-show elements.  They performed the whole Misplaced Childhood album along with many others.  Amazing----Fish rocked!!<br />To the uninitiated, I say this is the first Marillion release you should own.  Can't go wrong...
B000053VAF|3.0|I love Mr. Smith's directing and writing. He's just freakin' awesome. So I hold him to very high standards. I know a lot of people talked trash about this movie, but it really wasn't bad. What it was, was corrupted by Kevin Smith's celebrity friends and their cameos. One of the things about Kevin Smith's earlier movies was the actors involved didn't detract from the movie. Even Amy with a then-unknown Ben Affleck. In this case, however, it's hard to let the story shine with people like Matt Damon involved. And don't get me wrong- I love Matt Damon.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This album is awesome. Sarah McLachlan has a great voice, it's peaceful and enchanting. Also if like something more peaceful to listen to once in a while and not clasical than this is it. Her songs are great for just starting off the day, and while you're working. Adults will love it also, older people will enjoy it more than kids I think ... If you like Dido to than you'll like Sarah. Trust me when I say to buy this cd, it truly is the best!
B00003W8NM|5.0|There might be no rational way to describe this movie, nor the style, nor the story, nor the characters.  It is, in fact, by far one of the most unique and eccentric films that I have ever had the pleasure to witness.  And a true pleasure it undoubtedly was.  In fact, I wish that I could make this a well-rounded review with adequate portions of praises and criticisms, but it is just too well-done, too visually appealing, too imaginative of a film to be attributed with any minute, negative traits.  This is a film that sets about redefining the style of filmmaking; the fact that it succeeds establishes this film as one of the all-time greatest.  Every moment, visual, line, and character is a forward leap in filmmaking that never fails to inspire and impress.<br />First of all, before you ever realize how psychologically deep it is, you'll find it hilarious.  With great attention to the idiosyncratic clash between \\"civilized\\" culture and the counterculture that opposes it, Fight Club satirizes every institution to great depth.  Nothing is sacred; nothing is revered.  Moreover, visual effects are utilized to a new end, not simply as a device to convey plot, but also to expand the mood, the momentum, and the character psychology.  But as the film continues, as the characters grow and the situation becomes increasingly dire, one can't help but be pulled into this neurotic visualization of criminal life.  It is a story and a set of characters that pulls you into a new world and makes you seriously question the one that you have lived in for all of your life.<br />And all of this couldn't have happened without truly magnificent performances.  Edward Norton is always great, but offers a multi-faceted performance that rivals his more appreciated works.  Brad Pitt is perfect for the role; no one else could have played it as effectively.  And then there is Helena Bonham Carter who is...Weird--and that's what makes her great.  The direction is ambitious and enthusiastic, both heavily to the film's credit.  By being so eccentric, the direction obviously sets and then expands upon the mood from the opening credits to the very last shot--arguably one of the greatest concluding shots in film history.  But none of this would have had any great impact without the clever and meticulous script that always offers a surprise and maintains the momentum during every scene.<br />And so all of this culminates into what has now become one of my all-time favorite films.  There are just so many great ideas offered, so many interesting characters and perversely fascinating images, and moreover such a psychologically profound story that one cannot help but become enthralled with this masterwork of new age filmmaking.  But beyond that, it sets a style that people will be mimicking for some time, but with lesser success.  Fight Club stands as one of the most unique and inspiring films of the 90's.  It certainly deserves your attention and respect.
B0000508U6|5.0|When I first heard this CD, it took some adjusting to, because I had never heard anything like it before.  I quickly grew into it, however, and discovered how bee-oooo-tiful this album is!  It's got a serene, tranquil, unreal feel to it, like going into a new world.  The music itself sounds kind of depressing at times, but the lyrics give a whole other meaning.  It's a CD about hope, about living life, and it just doesn't get old.  Further, I find it's an excellent CD to just sit down and meditate to.<br /><br />One last thing (and some people think I'm crazy for this), but the lead singer's voice sounds shockingly like Dave Matthews!  You decide for yourself.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes to try something new and listen to music that is both sobering and inspirational at the same time!
0440224764|5.0|I have read most of John Grisham's books, but this was the best since A Time to Kill.  I could not stop reading and the twisted plot kept me guessing all the way.  I was completely shocked at the surprise ending.  I highly recommend it!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|My Favorite From The Dave Era 1974-1985, Van Halen has always given the best music in that era. Fair Warning is awesome, <BR>#1 Mean Street- The Solo, The Ripping Intro, Everything about this song is awesome.<BR>#2- &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;- Underrated song, like most Van Halen songs. The Drum Intro is exciting and Alex' Drums echo, and the sheer sound of Eds Guitar,   great song<BR>#3-Sinner's Swing- A Rebellious song, Great Lyrics, Brillance in your cd player<BR>#4- Hear About It Later- The Intro to this, you may think this is a quiet song- NO WAY, my favorite part is after they sing &quot;But I Ain't Home At Night&quot;, then alex is banging on the drum and eddie is ripping at the intro of the Solo<BR>#5- Unchained- The Tearing sound of the intro sounds better than ever because of the remastering, This song has always been good<BR>#6- Push Comes To Shove- Great song, but underrated, Excellent solo from the guitar god eddie, <BR>#7- So This is Love?- This song has the groove, the bass by michael anthony, Everything about this song makes sense.<BR>#8 and 9- Sunday Afternoon In The Park and One Foot Out The Door- They fade into each other so perfectly, One Foot Out The Door, is yet another underrated song, David's Voice in it is Angry, Great Song, Great Album, Great Times.<BR>      I will always treasure van halen's Albums, THEY ARE THE GREATEST IN THIS UNIVERSE.- I said what is true.  Pick fair warning up and have a good time.
B00004NHCC|5.0|In a word, exquisite!. The liner notes say that the masterpiece of the album is \\"Embraceable You\\" but for me it's \\"September Song\\" It's like a piece of Valrhona bittersweet chocolate.  I have no other words to describe it, just buy it and listen, but not after you break up with someone because I guarantee you'll get depressed if you do.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|i believe this film should win the best picture in the oscars. truly, innovative and cunning. a film out of our paradigm. simply the best. nice soundtrack also....
B000051ZST|5.0|Well, when it's good it's good no argument about it - I saw this movie several times, and laughed every time. Excellent scripts, not a single moment wasted in the film. The story is about guys who go on a road trip to get the tape that what accidently sent to the girlfriend of one of the guys. Anything and everything happens to them, so don't wait, if you're looking for a good comedy you found one, now buy it! Believe me, you'll enjoy it. I know I have.
0743420373|3.0|I think the controversy over this book comes down to whether or not you are comfortable living below your means.  That is essentially what the authors suggest as the most assured approach to becoming one of America's wealthiest.  A related issue is the reality of what being a millionaire means nowadays.  Having a net worth of a million or two just doesn't put you in that elite of a class - that group now comprises 7% of American households (according to more recent business magazines).  And it hardly affords you the luxury of a million dollar house, frequent exotic travel, or having your name on the new wing of your local library.  But I think the value of the book is to serve as a wakeup call for those who focus too much on immediate gratification and not enough on maintaining some level of comfort in their retirement years.  I have to say that the lifestyle of some of the PAWs in the book leaves you feeling that it's not worth becoming a millionaire if it means you're living a middle class life all day, every day.  Sometimes you have to splurge - treat yourself to indulgences.  I think you can do that and still build some meaningful wealth.  If you're someone who takes comfort in focusing on maintaining your quality of life once you stop working, the you are probably already living the life profiled in this book.  No need to buy it.  But if you are someone who isn't maxing out your 401(k) plan, eats out 3-4 nights a week, and doesn't pay your credit cards off each month, then you could definitely learn something from this book - and you should probably read it before it's too late.
B00005QDW5|3.0|There are some choice songs on this CD. However, They really don't blend well. Marooned, what was the point of putting that on there? In its place could have been Have A Cigar or Pigs both great songs. Pigs really should have made it because of the blistering guitar solo by Gilmour. What really annoys me is the way they mixed Comfortably Numb. Time to go...Is there anybody out there... On The Wall it sounds good but on this it just doesn't belong. I give this 3 stars. This album was saved from total blah by a nice second CD. As far as a sleeve...who wants song lyrics...I would of rather have had an explanation as to why some of those songs are on there...though some are obvious and Floyd fans know which ones they are. But for the ones that have me baffled I would really like to know.
630588255X|5.0|Glum-faced stoop-shouldered suicidal Harold meets Maude; he is still a teenager while she has decided that her life will be ending, shortly, at her own hand, after almost 80 years on the planet.  In one unforgettable week, she teaches him how to find joy, how to embrace his life in its every aspect, and even takes him into her bed -- all this set to a Cat Stevens soundtrack.  It's too much, too funny, and altogether wonderful.  One of my all-time favorites -- buy it; you will love yourself in the morning.
B000056K04|4.0|True Fans should be a little more open minded as to How DMB wants to play ans sound. A creative musician likes to expand his horizons which is what DMB has done on this album. Maybe it isn't what you would like to hear from him but how can you limit your favorite musician to just one style of music. Shame on you for putting him in a position to do just that. If you limit him then he just become another predictable artist. I happen to like this album and hope he does some more different stuff. It shows that he is open minded and is willing to take a chance. So to all the DUMB Fans limit his style and you end his career.
B00003CX9E|2.0|In spite of all the hype that has been generated for this movie, I frankly find it boring and extremely slow moving. Orson Welles is ponderous, and his character is almost cartoonish. He is so domineering that the other characters almost seem like an afterthought. While I like fine film making, I found the use of dubious camera angles distracting. The plot is so stiff that it is borish beyonf belief. I own the VHS version but will not buy it for my DVD collection, which is replacing my VHS collection.

B00000K0EA|3.0|Pierce Brosnan's second 007 film suffers from one irredeemable flaw---the villain. Brosnan himself settles into the role of Bond, and makes it his own, in a manner unsurpassed since Sean Connery.<br /><br />Brosnan's Bond is more accessible, and more humane and sensitive than Connery's. Somehow, you just can't imagine Brosnan's Bond loving and leaving them without just a twinge of regret. Unlike Connery's Bond, Brosnan's Bond has room for nostalgia. It's obvious in his relationships with Agent Wai-Lin (Michelle Yeoh) and Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher).<br /><br />Brosnan's comedy is more pointed and more restrained than Roger Moore's. While Moore played it for laughs (and ended up parodying himself), Brosnan satisfies himself primarily with Connerian quips.<br /><br />He also looks wonderful in Brioni. Timothy Dalton's Bond always had an air of disrepute, like he was hiding a badly frayed cuff,  but Brosnan is all style.<br /><br />TOMORROW NEVER DIES concerns the machinations of media mogul Eliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), a kind of Rupert Murdoch with rabies, who lives by the McLuhanesque dictum that \\"the media is the message.\\"  Believing so, he starts World War Three just to get the scoop.<br /><br />This already absurd premise suffers all the more because Pryce is horribly miscast. Dressed all in black, he resembles a middle aged wannabe hip SoHo gallery owner far more than a corporate titan. The character radiates no power and no threat. (Think of Michael Douglas in WALL STREET for a counterpoint.)<br /><br />Do we really care if this hornrimmed nebbish wants 72 point type on page one? And would a man like this really command the authority to manipulate China and Great Britain into a war? Would this loser really have been able to entice Teri Hatcher away from Bond?<br /><br />The answer to all three questions is no, and, despite the rest of the fine acting and fast action, TOMORROW NEVER DIES goes flat because there's no tension. This Bad Guy isn't SPECTRE, he's The Paperboy.<br /><br />We already know that Bond is going to prevail over the villain. The difficulty of doing so is the fun part. The problem is that my kid sister could prevail over Eliot Carver. Watching my sister beat this geek up would be more dramatic than TOMORROW NEVER DIES.<br /><br />The shame is that this could have been among the best of the Bonds. As it is, it's merely average.g to prevail over the villain. The difficulty of doing so is the fun part. The problem is that my kid sister could prevail over Eliot Carver.

B00005TT77|3.0|Food for though...<BR>I heard the producers actually wanted to get permission to use the Beatle versions of these songs but couldn't because there wasn't enough time.<BR>Nice story.<BR>I'm not trying to detract from the music, but cover versions may have been used simply because the cd would sell a heck of a lot better. I mean, this cd isn't aimed at Beatle fans: There are a dozen different musicians here, each with their legions of fans who might buy this simply for the single track by their favorite artist.<BR>Plus, I would venture to say that most Beatle fans already have these songs in their original Beatle-form.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Any adult who \\"laughs\\" off this film obviously has no sense of reality.  Shock therapy, amputation, prison and degrading sex are all a fact of life.  Every single day in this country, somewhere, somebody is living through a real life version of this film.   <br />Having been working in the EMS field for the past decade, I have witnessed first hand the horrors of drug addiction.  When I first started working on an ambulance, it was complete culture shock.  I had relatives and friends of patients I would be picking up, tell me how wonderful a person so-and-so was, that they can't believe how fast that that persons life fell apart.  I couldn't believe it.  Normal people, who had normal jobs and normal families somehow let all that slip slowly away because they could not say no to drugs.  You've all heard this happen, but until you see it first hand, you don't get the full grasp of it.  <br />Darren Aronofsky perfectly gives us a sense as to the power that drugs have.  He opens the viewers eye's to how some parts of our society live on a daily basis.  I'm sorry \\"wsidechris\\" if Jared Leto's accent isn't on par to your taste's.  Go back to the Gumdrop Mountain section of NYC that you live in and let the rest of us enjoy this great film, which is a fantasticly acted, sobering look at drug addiction.  I promise, once you are finished watching this movie, it will remain on your mind for quite a long time.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is so well made, it is sometimes difficult to remember it was filmed in 2001 and not 1959. It's a mouth-watering experience. Being that I own this movie now, and have seen it 3 or 4 times, I always order chocolate-drizzled brownies from a local restaurant while we watch it. Beware, you don't want to see this one without something sweet.<br /> Vianne(Binoche) and her daughter Anouke, travel with the North winds. On this new journey(in 1959), they land in a small town outside France that seems to be stuck in a time warp. <br /> \\"Tranquility\\" , says the town mayer, is the \\"motto\\" of his small province. Vianne and her Chocolaterie, bright red shoes, sexy clothes, and illegitimate daughter are exactly what the mayor does not welcome into his quiet little town. Epecially, during Lent.<br /> Vianne still manages to stir up love and lust with her ancient chocolate formulas under the watchful eye of the Mayor. \\"One bite and you are hooked\\". Her time in the little moral town is interupted with wonderful characters and new friends. I loved Johnny Depp as the gypsy who lands his riverboat alongside the little town, only to cause distubances amongst the chuch-going frenzy of people. He and Juliet Binoche light up the screen and make a sexy match.<br /> The movie, although a dramatic one, has some outrageous funny moments as well.  Dame Judi Dench, one of my favorite actresses, plays the landlord of Vianne's Chocolaterie. Every word out of her mouth is sarcastic and somewhat \\"dirty\\"(very reminiscent of her small coveted role in Branagh's \\"Henry V\\"). I enjoyed her truthfulness and laughed along with her lines.<br /> It doesn't need to be Valentine's Day for someone to enjoy this delicious movie. Why not buy it and package it with a box of chocolates for your sweetheart.

6305350205|4.0|The more that I see this film the better I enjoy it.  Many reviews have been written which detail its strengths and weaknesses.  I found that, by means of a subtle sense of humor, it demonstrates the value of human friendship, and I believe that its most valuable contribution, in the Star Trek genre, is that it attempts, in what I consider a serious way, to deal with the mystery of human suffering.
B000062TU1|1.0|Um...yeah. That is all I can say about this movie. Really, if you have gone to see this movie, and haven't read the books, you'll think it's good. But if you've read the books, I say Don't see the movie! It's horrid! The Quidditch match was ok, but the special effects were so computer generated it's not funny! And to top it off, The Philosophers Stone is the worst book of them all! Those who think the movie is better I have one thing to say. Were we watching the same movie?! I doubt it. 2-3 minute scenes do NOT make a movie! The Dursleys weren't mean to Harry at all! Unless you count the 'throwing him in the closet' thing after the zoo! And what happened to Ms. Figg?! And Peeves?! And Neville going into the Forbidden Forest?! Ron didn't go! And what about the potions thing?! It shows the pure genius of Severus Snape and they just cut it out! Oh! And about people who are talking about the title 'The Sorcerers Stone' don't blame the Americans! JK Rowlings editor(I think) suggested the change in title! She changed it herself! She's said so! I give this movie one star for the simple fact that its Harry Potter, enough said.
B000005JAB|5.0|A fully realized suite of music from a restless artist who knew better than to get stuck purveying crowd-pleasing pop.  Cale's instinct is always to push beyond self-satisfaction.  The result is a lushly produced set of songs that grow on you, that deepen in your ear, that finally make you wonder how in the world such smart, relentlessly melodic, rocking and rolling music could have escaped your notice for so long...and yet a set of songs that ache to be something more than just &quot;a set of songs on an album.&quot;  In this sense Paris 1919 is both a consummate example of early seventies post-Beatles English modern rock and a pulling away from that very same accomplishment--albeit a gentle pull.  Cale, skeptical of pop music's desire to satisfy completely, needs that edge.
B00005RHGK|4.0|These people that complain about the downbeat ending seem to be missing the point.  Folks, folks, folks, IT'S A HORROR MOVIE.  See, no happy bubblegum endings.

6303695779|4.0|VAMPYR is a very hypnotic horror film. It may seem slow going &amp; somewhat incoherent, but let the atmosphere of the movie wash over the viewer. This movie should be savored for its chilling atmosphere. A variation of Sheridan Le Fanu's CARMILLA, VAMPYR is about mood, atmosphere, shadows, &amp; light. The sounds &amp; the dialogue seem muffled, but that's what adds to the chilling atmosphere. Like watching a virtual lyrical nightmare, VAMPYR is a nightmarish classic.

This movie can be considered a horror-comedy. It's also a morality tale on how immortality has its price. Bruce Willis plays a reluctant hero in this movie as he is given a choice: Accept Immortality & Live Forever, or Rot Away & Die. <br />DEATH BECOMES HER is highly recommended.
B000000OSE|5.0|If you ask me, guns n roses had matured greatly during the touring years following the \\"appetite\\" release.  They had grown as a band both lyrically and musically.  This is evident upon listening to the \\"use your illusion\\" albums.   What many have viewed as inferior to their previous groundbreaking album, I view as one of the most amazing achievments of rock music.  The diversity and quality of the music is far superior to anything that anyone was coming up with at the time.  Axl's vocals have obviously changed due to his exposure to Faith No More's Mike Patton.  His delivery is rich and layered.  The band doesn't stick to just a blues-rock medium as in  \\"appetite\\" but branches into straight rock, electronica, blues, soft ballads and some compositions which defy categorization.  These albums show a band at its creative breaking point.  This was the bands' \\"Abbey Road\\".  The swansong of a rock band and the fulcrum of the transition between \\"80's rock\\" and \\"grunge\\".  A must-have for any real music fan.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|I remember when I was about seven years old, I got a hold of Sade's debut vinyl album, 'Diamond Life' (1984), and played it on the record player.  I was instantly hooked by what I heard.  Since then, every album that Sade has done has been stellar as well.  'Lovers Live' continues in that same tradition.  It's about time that Sade released a live CD!  <br />The lovely guitar riffs in \\"Cherish The Day\\" have never sounded better.  \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\" are probably the standout tracks on this live album.  On `S. T.', as well as with most of the CD tracks, Sade's vocals are very up-front in the sound which makes it seem like you are really there.  Sade's speaking intros before some songs, also adds a quaint touch.  The live version of \\"Flow\\" is much much better than the original album version.  Also, the CD photography is very good.  <br />But, I have a few concerns about this CD.  I wish the CD album compilers just went ahead and put all 22 tracks from the concert series into a double CD package/album, rather than having this one disc with 13 songs.  I actually bought this CD from a Wherehouse Music, and their versions of the CDs included an exclusive bonus single CD inside with the live version of \\"Lovers Rock\\" (not available on the one live CD).  Now I'm thinking, couldn't the Sony/Epic label just have made a full double CD release instead?  It must have come down to some contractual agreement and licensing issue and time constraints because the live version DVD, that will be released, will showcase the entire concert, including the nine extra songs that are not on the live CD.  Since the double CD couldn't be made, then I think that the compilers should have rethought their track add/drop process.  I say this because I would much rather have the live versions of \\"Your Love Is King\\" (from the DVD) taking the place of \\"Slave Song\\", \\"It's Only The Love That Gets You Through\\" (from the DVD) taking the place of \\"The Sweetest Gift\\", and I am pretty sure thatthey would have enough time left to just go ahead and add an extra 14th track and have the live album contain \\"Lovers Rock\\" (from the DVD as well) for that one.  This all just seems like a combination of tough track album pressing selection choices melded with the marketing and business ploys of the music and entertainment industry.  I say this because now I am probably going to have to go buy the DVD also, just so I can hear those (replacement) songs mentioned above.  It's obvious the visual effect of the concert will be a nice adage.  But it's not like I can bump the tracks from that DVD in my car, so I just wished this live album was configured a little differently than how it is being presented and sold to avid fans of Sade's music.  <br />Also at times, the crowd seems very rambunctious, cheering and yelling from out of nowhere during a song's progression, sometimes drowning out Sade's vocals, which can be a distraction to some listeners because it slightly ruins the intimacy of the live CD recording.  But, I guess there is really nothing that the recording engineer can do here.<br />However, this live CD again reveals how Sade's lyrics are true to the soul and how her voice can affect you in such a way that some moments seem to be amorously paralyzing. The CD also showcases how Sade has one of the best production bands(Denman/Hale/Mathewman) out there which formulate the aura for her sound and propel her beauty even further.  <br />Sade is definitely paradise, and in many cases, cherished therapy for matters of the heart.  So this live CD, given its slight track sequencing flaws, warmly exists accordingly.<br />:-)
031219126X|3.0|I enjoyed this book, even though it was nothing like anything that I expected.  When I first thought of Frankenstein, I saw a creature that was ten feet tall, had bolts in his neck, and was hideously ugly.  As I started reading the book, I soon realized that Frankenstein wasn't the name of the creature at all, it was the inventor.  Mary Shelley never gave the creature a name, which I thought was odd.  She did give a description of him, but I was surprised that it was nothing like the \\"classical image of Frankenstein.\\"  This book was at times hard to follow, and hard to predict.  At times, I wondered if this hideous creature was really so bad.  Mary Shelley painted this picture of thoughtfulness and actually gave the creature a heart.  He was seen as a monster by society, when in fact he had the heart of a human to the reader.  This book puts all the movies that I have ever seen about Frankenstein to shame.  I started to wonder where the writers of the movie got their information, because they changed one of the most important elements of the book-the creation and the character names.
078324228X|1.0|It would so easy to lavish accolades on this movie because it was &quot;based on a true story&quot;. But I didn't as much as raise an eyebrow, so that's not a problem for me:) The problem for me is to see anything redeeming in a film that portrays blame shifting and gutlessness as if they were virtue. Seemed like hours and hours of Denzel Washington &amp; Co. hemming and hawing and trying to prove his innocence and doing what is right, for nothing more than putting on a weak, cockamamie and sappily over-acted version of &quot;Raging Bull&quot;.<br />But don't get me wrong...Denzel Washington &amp; Co. did a wonderful job convincing me of their cluelessness. But is this really something I need to see portrayed for the price I spent on this rental? A film should inspire, entertain, educate. This did none of the above. It just spun its wheels and lapsed into cliche and pulled easy strings to get a tear or two.<br />Overall I give it one star - don't waste your time. Sure wish I hadn't!

B00003CXZ1|2.0|You Know It's Bad.<br />I could only manage to watch Tomb Raider in half-hour segments, because quite frankly, it was one of the worst movies I have seen to date. I'm a fan of the video game series because I think it is very well done and really improved the 3rd Person Shooter Genre. However, I can't believe Eidos (the game maker, may be pronounced : Idiots) sold their rights to a movie for this game.<br />Did I mention I fell in a plot hole?<br />The plot holes in this movie are so large I fell in. Really. The reason I got a headache was not from all the shooting, blowing up stuff, and all that, but because the story line is something a five year old could have written up. In fact, its so bad I can't even sumerize the story because I don't know what the hell happened.<br />Anyways.<br />The DVD itself isn't that bad. I give it 4 stars. Excellent video quality. Excellent sound quality. The Music Video by U2 (Elevation) is well done and sounds great, even without surround sound. <br />The extra features are wholesome to say the least. After viewing the movie you can understand why there are 8 segments on special effects and none on the script... The Making Of was good, I had seen it on HBO before, however it was well done. There was also a \\"Easter Egg\\" with Jolie + Voight (Her Father), it was touching.<br />The DVD-ROM had some other small features. The only one I looked at was the Demo for Tomb Raider: Chronicles. It was fun for about a half hour.<br />The only reason I gave the DVD Section 4 Stars was because no trailers were there. And I love trailers. Oh Well.<br />In Review:<br />Movie - 1 Star<BR>DVD - 4 Stars<BR>Overall - 2 Stars (Horriable Movie, Good DVD, No Trailers)<br />Suggested Viewing Order: (Movie, if you must); Making Of; Special Effects; Video Game -> Movie; U2 Video; Father/Daughter (Easter Egg); DVD-Rom Features.

B000002U94|5.0|When compared to Bob Seger And The Silver Bullet Band's 1981 powerful live album \\"Nine Tonight\\", Peter Frampton's \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\"--often considered the greatest live album of rock and roll--appears standard and uninspired.<br />\\"Nine Tonight\\" is an incredible, emotionally charged live set from one of rock and roll's most captivating (yet under-appreciated) performers, Bob Seger. Few times in rock music--especially in the seventies and eighties--does there come along an artist with the ability to captivate a large stadium audience, while at the same time putting on a classic rock and roll show; at the time \\"Nine Tonight\\" was released, a stereotype surrounded rock musicians like Bob Seger...that the music, no matter how great it may sound in a studio recording, would always be overshadowed by rowdy crowds filling stadiums only for the parties.<br />But Bob Seger, with the thundering and flawless Silver Bullet Band, broke that sterotype with an almost magical ability to connect with an audience, to speak to thousands of people in a concert arena as if he were speaking solely with each individual person in the audience.<br />\\"Nine Tonight\\" captures that magic. With each time you listen to the album, you get a sense that Bob Seger is trying to send a message solely to you, yet you still feel the intense excitement of a live performance.<br />Any Silver Bullet fan knows that Seger and company are some of the best rock and roll performers to experience live. But for anyone with a taste for wonderful live music, I strongly recommend \\"Nine Tonight.\\" You won't be disappointed.

B00005JGAB|5.0|The story of the Ramones has been told so many times, it has become a cliche` of history; from New York's infamous CBGB's Club, four shaggy-looking young men known as The Ramones (taken from a legend that ex-Beatle Paul McCartney had used the pseudonym to check into a hotel), played over a dozen songs in less than thirty minutes, all with a sonic deadpan approach that would become their unmistakable trademark.<br />The Ramones were the innovators, if not the inventors of what we know as punk music. They inspired such punk legends as the Clash, Johnny Rotten, and Sid Vicious, just to name a few. But, as time passed, they became overshadowed by the acts they had inspired, yet the Ramones somehow maintained their undeniable status as unquestionable legends.<br />And this was the album that started it all, from the band that started it all. The Ramones' self-titled debut, recorded in a few days for less that six thousand dollars, is not only one of the greatest contributions to punk, but one of the greatest contributions to music. All of the Ramones' brilliant trademarks are represented here: heavy three-chord alchemy, simple, punkish, sometimes repeatitive lyrics, and a hint of tribute to the rock and roll of the 1950's.<br />Though I am not a fan of any other punk band, the Ramones remain my all-time favorites; they did one thing, did it greatly, and moved on to their next triumph.<br />Any band, any album such as this one, that can have the power and exhiliration to actually breathe life into a form of music must definitely be a masterpiece of music, from Mozart to John Lennon to what we are hearing now.

0812550706|5.0|I love this book; it is definately going to be a classic (and already is, now that you mention it).  Except for my Western loving dad, who found the book to be &quot;OK,&quot; everyone I've spoken to who has read the book loved every minute of it.  I opened it as I was walking down the steps to the car.  I read the first sentence and was immediately hooked, I read it as I got in the car, got buckled, rode with my parents to the restaurant, read it while waiting on the table, walking to the table, sitting at the table, eating my dinner, as my dad paid for the meal, as I got back in the car, all the way home, etc. until I finished the book.  This, my friends, does not happen very often.

B00005OB0A|2.0|I don't think that this is the best album that she has done. But, I think as her next single, she should put out the song<BR>Fraglie. That song is cool on her new album. I hope that it gets out as a single on the radio someday. Plus if any of Kylie fans are looking for a new pen pal, you can write to me. Thanks!
B00004C4KZ|5.0|I have often wondered why Tangerine Dream never seems to go away. The stuff they've done in the last 15 years or so is so generic that it's not even funny, their music during that time period seems pretty indistinguisible from any countless incidental music found on TV shows and movies. In my opinion, TD should have called it quits after they released Force Majeure in 1979. My opinion of Tangerine Dream in the 1970s is totally different and I found what they did some of the most interesting music I have ever heard. Atem is their final album from Ohr, and apparently they left the label because they were sick of Rolf Ulrich Kaiser (the owner of Ohr) marketing the band like freaks (R.U. Kaiser changed the label name from Ohr to Kosmische Musik after Atem and Ash Ra Tempel's Join Inn were released), this was the exact same reason why Klaus Schulze also left Ohr/Kosmiche Musik as well. It could also be the fact that BBC Radio mogul John Peel loved Atem and gave the band exposure outside of Germany and so a British label showed interest in them (in this case, Virgin). By Ohr standards, Atem is by far TD's most accessible album during that era (1970-1973), but even that album is quite inaccessible, but still easier to get in to than Zeit or Alpha Centauri. Listening to this album, there is absolutely no evidence where this band was headed when they signed to Virgin (no sequencer heavy synth patterns here, it's still pretty much the same vein as Alpha Centauri and Zeit). Atem opens with the title track which features this really cool Mellotron and percussion and as the intensity builds up to a climax, there's this explosion in which the sound dies down to some really cool droning. \\"Fauni-Geni\\" is basically a demonstration of Edgar Froese's Mellotron, with tons of cool effects that sounds like it came out of a jungle. He'd later expanded on the style of that cut on his second solo album, Epsilon in Malaysian Pale (1975). \\"Circulation of Events\\" is another really disturbing droning cut, while \\"Wahn\\" features some really disturbing screaming that even disturbed my mother (and she's used to the music I listen to). All the music has that really creepy atmosphere and the cover, created by Edgar Froese himself, really fits the music very well. The baby on the cover is that of Edgar's son, Jerome Froese, little did anyone know back in 1973 that some 20 years later, that baby, who would be grown up by that time, would be a member of this band (unfortunatley they were no longer worth listening to by that time).

B000002UR7|5.0|Debut album? This cd's better than almost anything any of those long established bands have put out as of late, maybe even Radiohead included.  <br />These songs have a majesterial dignity about them.  Guitar driven, but Thom Yorke puts in soulful vocals that leaves one awestruck.  Simplistic, in a way, but with lyrical sophistication and intermittent musical wizardry, this album portends the bends and to some extent, ok computer.  This album is rock and roll at its imperfect best.  <br />Radiohead rocks.  That can only be said about a few huge acts out there today.  Among this class of bands is U2, the chilli peppers and a few others that are eluding me right now.  Before I start getting off topic, though, buy this album; you won't be disappointed.
0060278234|5.0|I said it once and I'll say it again, Garth Nix is a brilliant writer, and just like Sabriel, this book is worth every cent. <BR>Once again we return to the Old Kingdom, fourteen years after Sabriel binded the Greater Dead Adept Kerrigor. While she is now Queen of the Old Kingdom as well as the Abhorsen, we also become acquainted with a new heroine.<BR>Lirael is one of the all-seeing family of Clayr who live in their glacier in the north of the Old Kingdom. However Lirael, an orphan amongst her people, hasn't acquired the Clayr trdemark, the Sight and is beginning to feel inadequate. <BR>Sameth, son of Sabriel and Touchstone, and recently returned from school in neighbouring Ancelstierre, is also feeling inadequate as he is being expected to train as the Abhorsen in Waiting. The problem? He can't stomach Death or anything connected with it after a recent encounter with an evil necromancer.<BR>With trouble mounting in the west of the country and both Clayr and Royalty puzzled as to what it is, Lirael and Sameth both find themselves on roads leading that way, for very different reasons, and discovering much about themselves along the way.<BR>In this book, Nix gives much more background on his characters before the main plot takes hold. The Great Library of the Clayr is a feat of imagination and the reader finds it full of danger and mystery. Charter magic is portrayed more here too, as both main characters are quite adept at it. Small snatches of how the Charter was created also appear along with hints as to the nature of Mogget. Though the sequel spills over into another, as-yet unpublished volume, Lirael could almost stand alone. If you too are fascinated by  the Old Kingdom, you will surely read this book, even if just out of curiosty's sake and you won't be disappointed.
B00004Y2FT|3.0|The Cocteau Twins are an amazing band, do not get me wrong, but 4AD's new let's-sell-best-ofs-to-make-money scheme really failed here (as it did with Lush's Ciao!).  Numerous shining moment of the band's career are absent and some of the choices are just bad! Not including Ivo and Musette and Drums or more disdainfully substituting Wax and Wane for Blind Deaf Dumb (clearly the bands more break out track from Garlands) is just preposterous! Here's a great opportunity to throw the NME version of Ivo to the public, or the Red Tape version of Pitch The Baby rather than just using 50/50 clown as filler. The liner notes are just laughable.  The remaster is quite good, but there is just something magical amiss in this collection.  It's worth it for the remaster, and to have all of these songs in one place (especially Watchlar, one of my personal favorite tunes ever), but they could have done a much better job.
B00002E224|5.0|At first, I thought it's going to be one of the usual American girl/guy movies. But after several minutes I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. It's everything you ever did or felt being in love. Every little thing. I beleived every glimpse and every giggle. Actors are natural as if they live the movie. No effects, no melodrama, pure joy of two young hearts.

B00000JPH6|3.0|I won't dwell on the finer points of this film,it's easily one of the best looking fantasy films from the 80's.The set pieces are outstanding and beautiful.The puppetry is extremely lifelike and the characters are compelling if somewhat simplistic.<br />So my only complaint,and it's a huge one if you enjoy audio as much as me,is the sound transfer.It seems as though the sound was transferred from some old VHS copy and they did'nt bother to digitize it.The dialogue in many scenes seems as if it was recorded inside an aluminum shed,it has a &quot;scratchy&quot; sound,for lack of a better word.The bass is virtually non existent,my subwoofer was only engaged about 4 or 5 times,and the rear surrounds were barely utilized at all.When they were,the effect was pitiful,almost a whisper.This is DVD,there was tremendous potential for this film with regards to audio.Especially when we find our young hero travelling through the forest,every speaker should have been in action during that sequence.It should have enveloped me,but instead disappointed and confused.<br />I would like to know what Columbia-Tristar and Henson studios were thinking,because it's obvious someone made a big mistake in authorizing this inferior transfer.And i don't want to hear that the movie is old,that's no excuse,because Carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot; is even older and the audio on that DVD was remastered and it sounds impeccable.<br />So,if you don't mind an underwhelming audio mix,and an above average video transfer(i have to agree with another reviewer,some section are scratched and appear blurred),then you can't go wrong with this well executed and highly entertaning fantasy film.I hope there are plans for another release with improved sound.

B00005BJR0|5.0|A person always has an all-time favorite movie that they have watched so many times that they can almost lip-sync the dialogue.  Blade Runner is MY all time favorite.  The music is haunting and the plot.... although a bit un-nerving.... is believable.  Will we end up like the Earth portrayed in the movie?  Certainly we are heading that way with the extermination of animals in the wild.  Will there come a time when what we call &quot;robots&quot; will be as human-like as those in the movie?  Who knows.  Will the climate on earth become as rotten as seen in the movie?  Will people leave Earth to find a better life?  SO many questions were raised in this movie.  I thought that the directors cut was vastly inferior to the original verson with Ford's voice-over explanation.... and I have a copy of both versions.  One of the most intricate and disturbing movie plots ever done.  I LIKE it!
B00005QATY|5.0|\\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\"  would be an important film viewed only as an archive of traditional American country music.  There is the phonomenal Ralph Stanley performance of \\"Oh Death\\" the Alison Krauss song \\"Down to the River to Pray\\", and various forms of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\"  which seems to form a refrain for the entire film.  <BR>   But then there is the excellent story telling abilities of the Coen Brothers.  These guys understand that the most important thing in a film is a solid script, and these guys know how to write.  They create some of the most eccentric interesting characters in film today.  <BR>   The acting is excellent- the actors seem ideal for their parts.  George Clooney is excellent- John Goodman is nearly perfect.  John Turturro is indispensible.  A great film.
B00004WG4G|5.0|American Beauty:<br /> Have you ever just gone through the motions of life? You get your degree, get married, have the requisite child, and then go on autopilot. Day after day you struggle out of bedmaybe kiss your wife hellomaybe not.grunt at your child and struggle in to work. You manage to smile and slink your way through the day and then it is back home again. You struggle through a meal with your wife and child where neither pays the least bit of attention to you and then it is off to bed. This is where it really gets fun since your wife wants to have nothing to do with you at this point. How would this make your feel or act? Better yet how would you act if suddenly you woke up and saw what was happening to your once promising life? American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, and written by Alan Ball explores this scenario and the consequences that follow.<BR> Lester Burnam has the life I described above. His wife, Carolyn, and his daughter, Jane, really have nothing to do with him. Carolyn has become the homemaker from hell with perfect meals accompanied by the sound track to South Pacific every night. She makes a living outside of the house as a real estate agent and seems to be having more success at it than Lester does in his job with a magazine, and she doesnt let Lester forget this. Lesters daughter Jane is going through all the typical high school angst trying to figure out where she fits in and she has no interest in having Dad as part of her life. <BR> Everything changes the night Carolyn drags Lester out to see Jane and her dance team perform at the high school game. As Lester blearily observes the performance his eyes are slowly drawn towards Janes friend, Angela. While he is watching her something in him begins to awaken and stir. She is a blond vision of sex drenched dreams.<BR> Shortly thereafter Lester attends a work function with his wife. While Carolyn is making eyes with the top realtor in the area, Lester comes upon his new teenage neighbor working as a waiter. They end up out back in the alley talking about life and, well for lack of a better word, smoking dope. When the headwaiter appears to chastise his errant waiter Lester is amazed to see him tell his boss where he can stick his job. The creature that was stirred by Angela is now fully inspired.<BR> Throughout the rest of the movie we see how Lester reacts to everyone that formerly had some means of control over him. The consultant at his job, his wife, and even his daughter are amazed but not necessarily pleased by the new Lester. The movie continues from this point showcasing how Lester, Carolyn, and Jane all react to the changes in life and how it effects each of them.<BR> Kevin Spacey plays Lester as if he was born to this role. He starts off the movie barely able to move from room to room. The bathroom scene shows how is wife has affected him and his despair at going to work shows through as he is barely able to stay awake. His wife runs roughshod over him and he crumbles. When he begins to undertake his transformation Spacey takes us a little step each time showing the Lester that once was as he comes forward. Spaceys timing and dialogue skills are shown to great heights throughout. He turns a simple sentence, I rule! into a battlecry for all downtrodden men. Very few actors could have handled this as well.<BR> Annette Bening, as Carolyn, also does a fine job as his wife however many people could have handled this role as well. She runs the gambit from total controlling wife/mother to falling apart woman but something was missing in how she did it. <BR> Thora Birch, Jane, handled her part better than Bening. She had the teenager embarrassed to be seen with the parents down to a t. At the same time she also had her own awakening to the fact that she didnt always have to play second fiddle to her star friend.<BR> This was an exceptionally well written movie. It did have some artsy-fartsy moments in it that slowed some of the scenes down but Spacey powered through them in one of his best performances yet. I highly recommend this film.

6305426694|3.0|A Civil Action:<br /> Water. It's a basic fact we need it to survive. The human body can go longer without food than it can water. But what do you do when the water you need to survive may be killing your children? A small town in the North Eastern part of the United States faced this very problem in the 1970s.<br /> John Travolta plays Lawyer Jan Schlictmann in this movie based off a true story. Jan is the hottest young lawyer in Boston. He is a personal claims lawyer (some would call him an ambulance chaser of the highest degree) with a thriving small practice. He is one of the 10 most eligible bachelors in Boston. Jan will do anything to win a case. He has his own personal equation as to which person will bring in the most money from a trial and thus fill his pockets the deepest. The client he desperately wants to avoid is a dead child as they are worth the least in a jury verdict. <br /> Everything is going well for Jan and then a case with at least 10 dead children drops into his lap. This case is known as an \\"orphan\\" as it has landed in every prominent lawyer's office and all have passed on it prior to him. Jan meets with the families to give them a personal \\"No thank you.\\" While there he finds of their suspicions as to chemicals that have been dumped into the ground and poisoned the water supply. What interests Jan the most is the parent companies behind the dumping. Suddenly a no interest case becomes one which could net him millions.<br /> The rest of the movie deals with Jan's obsessive involvement with this case. How it raises him to an almost unheard of prominence and dumps him into the lowest levels he has ever been. <br /> John Travolta does a good job in this role. He can play the ultimate of arrogance and also the most wounded of individuals as he grows to learn more about what life is truly about. William H. Macy is Jan's financial affairs person who is desperately trying to keep the firm afloat as Jan's obsession causes them to spend more and more.John Lithgow is fine as the Judge. Robert Duvall is great as the opposing lawyer who gives Jan a lesson in legal theatrics.<br /> The movie is well done but a little slow at times. Definitely would recommend it as the performances by all move this one.
1558908498|1.0|I have to give the original Scream some credit, even though I didn't like it too much, it revived the horror series and even inspired old horror sequels to start resurfacing (Halloween H20 & 8, Jason X, Bride of Chucky). But the things it also did to the wonderful horror genre are inexcusable. It seems like every new horror movie now borrows it's cast from Buffy, Dawson's Creek and Party of Five. Scream 2 does nothing to drop that trend, in fact, it just gets worse. The film takes place 2 years after the original, where (a very tired looking) Neve Campbell and the survivors of the first flick are starting over. However, a movie is made about the Woodsboro events called \\"Stab\\" and soon things start to stir up again and a new killer(s) is out to prove that all of today's violence can be blamed on the movies (Just watch, you'll see.) Scream 2 is ultimately a very subpar sequel. Everything just feels like a rehash of the original. The acting in this one is very poor, you don't really believe that these things are happening to the characters. The script is in desperate need of help and Courtney Cox looks really weird. The only upside this movie had (in my opinion) was that there was much more gore and the killings were more creative. ...
0312954468|5.0|Ancient Egypt is a facinating subject for many of us, and Wilbur Smith takes you there with vivid discription.  You get a good feel of the culture of that time.  The story of intrigue keeps you turning pages.  I have read a number of romances in the past, but the relatiosnhip between Lady Lostris and Tanus is one of the most unforgettable I have read.<br />I have also read &quot;Seventh Scroll&quot; which is a sequel to &quot;River God&quot; but enjoyed the first book more. I have put Wilbur Smith's latest book &quot;Warlock,&quot; which also takes place in Ancient Egypt, on my reading list.
0790731002|4.0|I have been a fan of the whole Batman franchise as long as I can remember, I got the original 1966 version of Batman &amp; Robin for Christmas when I was 5, and it all pretty much took off from there. Although I enjoy Tim Burton's dark interpretation of Batman in the first two flicks more, I find Batman Forever to be sort of a breath of fresh air. It is also one of my many guilty pleasures. Joel Schumacher's direction in this installment is pretty good. The sets are lavish and brilliant, and not as violently colorful and comic-bookish as the sequel that follows this. Nicole Kidman is nothing short of gorgeous in this movie. She definetly is the best female Batman has chased in all of his movies. Val Kilmer takes over after Michael Keaton left the series and does a surprisingly great job of being Batman. He is actually (Dare I say this?) a BETTER Batman. He adds so much more to the character that wasn't there before. And Jim Carrey,  I swear, the role of the Riddler was made for him. He really carries a lot of this movie through parts that would be otherwise boring. Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O Donell aren't really worth much of a mention however, both overdo their parts and come across as phony. The story has a few plotholes: How could Two-Face be the killer of Bruce's parents? We already saw in the first one that it was the Joker, he admitted it, we saw footage of him actually killing them, he said the exact same quote to Batman as he did to Bruce's parents, etc. I don't quite understand how Two-Face fits into that. But otherwise, Batman Forever is a fairly excessive, but enjoyable flick. Trust me, you have seen worse.
B00005A1PR|4.0|ACOUSTIC SOUL by India Arie is a disc that you put on, turn the lights low &amp; groove to with your honey. smooth and well recorded, it'll take a few spins before you realize that she is actually saying something behind all that. in &quot;video&quot; she proclaims that even though she ain't no pinup or video babe she is a queen, and &quot;brown skin&quot; celebrates the black experience. &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot; -- the title tells it to you. but none of this comes off preachy. i like the vibe she puts out here and this cd is worth checking out!
B000002IZM|3.0|I'll start off by saying that I saw Blade Runner with my father, and I strongly disliked it. I won't say that I hated it, because 'hate' is such a strong word. Anyhow, since my dad loved the movie so very much, he bought the soundtrack and listened to it constantly. Some people believe that if you're exposed to something for a long enough period of time, you'll grow to like it. I disagree with this belief, for the most part. I did not like this soundtrack. But I DID, however, enjoy track 4, Rachel's Song. That is the only reason I gave the soundtrack 3 stars. If you didn't like the movie, perhaps you'll like this song. If you LOVED the movie, I'm 99% sure that you will LOVE the soundtrack. Just feel better to know that someone who 'strongly disliked' the movie really liked one of the songs from it.<br />I hope those of you who didn't like the movie will still buy the soundtrack anyway, just for track 4. And because the economy could use the money.
B000002MJC|5.0|I'd like to re-emphasize the fact that this is really a complex, well-textured album, and it's pure Depeche Mode. If some of you have not listened to it because you're skeptical based on negative criticism - I urge you to give it a chance. You get that kind of intolerance in every musical style: If a Rock band incorporates synths, they're not &quot;real&quot; anymore. If an &quot;electronic&quot; band like DM incorporates organic instruments like guitars or acoustic drums, then they're &quot;not true to themselves&quot; anymore. What a load of bull. Who are these people to judge which sonic means the artist is supposed to use to create his art? If you want a certain result, you use certain methods. So get off it, guys, and open your ears and more importantly, your minds. As I said, this is pure Depeche Mode and nobody else could have done this album. Do yourselves a favor and listen.
B00005U2LM|4.0|Sometimes it's hard to be impartial when reviewing a band/group/artist you really like. That is the case at hand, but I must admit that this is by far the weakest album by Wu-Tang. I couldn't wait to buy this as soon as it came out, but I heard the complete album before its release and wasnt too happy. Wu-Tang is known for their unique, dark beats, but this album is commercialized as far as beats go. Don't get me wrong though, the lyrics are tight, typical Wu style. The two people that make this album good, Method Man and Inspectah Deck. A suprise in this album is the improvement of the not-so-good Cappadonna. Ghostface is Ghostface, bringing the random, yet hot verses to this cut. U-God &amp; Raekwon have seemed to decline lyrically over the past few years, but still do a decent job on the Iron Flag. <BR>RZA &amp; GZA both remain solid, and RZA has even improved lyrically. RZA's best work is still on Wu-Tang Forever. Masta Killa isn't on the album that often, which really isn't a good thing because he could have displayed his improvement. (For an example of this, check out Mortal Kombat by Afu-ra.) Below is the track rating (1-5):<br />In The Hood: 5<BR>Rules: 5+<BR>Chrome Wheels: 3<BR>Soul Power: 1 ( The beat is so annoying)<BR>Uzi: 4<BR>One Of These Days: 3.5<BR>Y'all Been Warned: 5<BR>Babies: 3<BR>Radioactive: 3.5<BR>Back In The Game: 4.5<BR>Iron Flag: 2 (40 seconds of sampling)<BR>Dashing: 4.5
6300213803|5.0|Seinfeld was right! While the first Trek movie, IMNSHO, was underrated for leading the others in sci-fi value, this first sequel tops in sheer entertainment. In \\"Khan\\", Kirk must confront his most implacable adversary - the evil Khan Nonnian Singh. A product of late 20th century eugenics, Khan and his followers briefly seized unparalleled power in our times, only to vanish before being defeated. Years later (on the episode \\"Space Seed\\") Khan and his followers were found by the crew of the USS Enterprise in a derelict vessel in suspended animation. Rather than kill Khan after he tries to seize the Enterprise, Kirk maroons him and his followers on Ceti Alpha V (big mistake) and forgets about him. Years later, surveying supposedly lifeless worlds as part of a secret Starfleet experiment, Commander Checkov accidentally lands on Khan's world, thinking it to be his neighbor Ceti Alpha VI. (The real Ceti Alpha VI exploded shortly after Khan's arrival on the neighboring world; the cataclysm turned his new home planet into virtually uninhabitable sand-ball; with the planet's only other surviving life-forms being large parasitic insects that eat their way through the brains of Khan's men, Khan himself has become quite ornery in his old age, and no-less bitter at Captain Kirk.) With his brilliance and ambition (and some of those bugs), Khan and company seize Checkov's ship and are free to wreak havoc on the galaxy. Two things hold Khan back - discovery that Checkov's mission involved an invention called \\"Genesis\\", a revolutionary device with a potentially dark side; but it is the possibility of revenge against Captain Kirk that keep shim from simply running. Meanwhile, Kirk has no command, merely supervises other cadets while the Enterprise is under command of (now Captain) Spock. On a training run with Kirk merely \\"observing\\", the Enterprise is ambushed by Khan and, largely crewed by cadets, nearly devastated. Thus begins a series of interstellar battles between the wounded Enterprise and Khan's renegade starship, partly over Genesis, but mostly over revenge. Complicating things for Kirk are the green crew, but also the presence of Genesis's developers, Carole Marcus and her son David - an old flame and the son they almost shared. Thinking Kirk responsible for an attack by Khan, and not quite big on military types in general, David becomes almost as vindictive towards Kirk as Khan.<br />This flick will be 20 years old this summer, and it's one more sign that Classic Trek endures over that \\"Next Generation\\" stuff. In every way, this entry is a gem in the Trek franchise - the special effects (now handled by ILM) are gorgeous, mixing with a great soundtrack by James Horner, and an underappreciated script that's light years above the newer brands of Trek. The characters lightly parody themselves - they're virtually retirees, too old to gallivant across space (but wisely not letting them come across as too friendly either). The script keeps to a few set themes (you're only as old as you feel; nobody dies if you can remember them; it's better to have hope for the future than harbor a thirst for revenge; an impossible challenge is something everybody must face; \\"Moby Dick\\" was a really cool book) frequently adding surprises. This film, more than the others, contributed to Trek's lore - the Kobayashi Maru; Romulan ale; starship prefix codes - with mixed results. (Kirk uses prefix codes on Khan's ship to briefly weaken it; though acknowledging it was a small trick rather than a master strategy he can feel proud of, latter incarnations of Trek have characters patting themselves on the back for relying on that trick). There's also a climactic space battle set within a nebula (a sort of planet-sized lightning cloud in space) that's a nod to a climactic submarine battle in \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\".  (That film was directed by Robert Wise who helmned the first Trek movie).  Even if you think the effects (circa 1982) are dated, you'll still get a top-notch script full of great lines. Kirk and McCoy, finding Doctor Marcus's space station deserted, opt to use her transporter to beam towards its last used destination, thinking that they are following the Doctor's trail. \\"What if they went nowehere?\\" McCoy asks. Kirk answers \\"Then this will be your chance to get away from it all.\\" This flick is your chance to get away from all that tired \\"Next Generation\\" Trek, with its reliance on techno-babble and anglo-accents.
080013558X|5.0|I saw this film last week for the first time in about ten years -and I was instantly taken back to being an eight year old loudly singing all the words! Regardless of the critical merits of this film (or lack of), it has such spirit that which child - of whatever age - could not be captivated by its charms? I don't care how faithful it is to the Broadway production - which I've seen and enjoyed - it was a wonderful part of my childhood and it's a film that I'll always love. I still know all the words and the amount I've been singing 'Tomorrow' in this past week I think I'm on the verge of being committed! Everybody now - Republicans too Oliver - 'tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow, you're only a day away............'
B000002MTU|1.0|Although Clapton has proven himself and provided some great music all around in the past, he failed to entertain here.  I couldn't believe this was E.C.?  His solos sound like some guy on 6th street in Austin trying to shove in as many notes as possible while still holding on to that Stevie Ray feel.  Where is the melodic sublime feel and tone that is Eric's trademark?  And the vocals have the soul of a white basement band in the suburbs.  Way, way too forced and un-natural.  Not at all what you expect from \\"God.\\"  This muic is trash.
B00000IQW3|3.0|If you want to relax, turn the brain off for a while this is one of those movies.  Fun, non-thinking, just have a good time. <br />Hey, I have seen it and have a great time!!!!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I could not wait to see this movie.<BR>You get lured in by certain takes in the pre-vieuws and by the music. Of course the costumes where great. The whole story is like a running joke of existing songs and a love story nobody really cares for. Truly it is now questionable why<BR> so many other good movies do not get the nominations they deserve. Why was this one even mentioned?????<BR>Hopefully this dusty old Oscar institution will be modernized. <BR>Why not involve the largest group of judges: the public.
0345440757|5.0|I bought this book when my first born son was 6 weeks old and I was utterly and miserably sleep deprived.  I found the writing style to be humorous and refreshing and the advice to be practical and based on common sense...but who has any sense with no sleep?  My baby slept 8 (continuous) hours a night by the age of 2 months and 12(continuous) hours a night before 3 months.  Is it because of the book? Maybe he would have slept well anyway but I thank Tracy Hogg because maybe he wouldn't have!  She has good advice about \\"starting as you mean to go on\\", avoiding the OVERUSE of props like pacifiers, and responding to your baby's needs.  WARNING! She is wrong about a mother's milk supply stopping after several weeks if the mother is exclusively pumping. I have exclusively pumped for 7 months and so do many other mothers who work, our milk supply is fine.<BR>If you want to sleep, give it a shot, it worked for us!

B00003CXXS|3.0|I'm sorry...but i was extremely dissapointed . I wont go into details because others seem to be quite good at that! i will say i even preferred TLW to this because there were quite a few scenes in that where i was at the edge of my seat...that did not happen here. i love dinosaurs and i love (usually) any movie which has them but here i was just so disheartened by the Velociraptors who appeared more like a bunch of ostriches obsessed with an egg rather than the fascinating creatures they are reputed to be! i had to see Jurassic Park again just to remind myself what i found interesting about them. i just hope they dont come up with another sequel. it would really kill the story.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Nothing is Artificial about this movie. The plot was so great that I had to see it again and again in the theater. This movie has everything. Jude Law's performance is brilliant, Halley Joel Osment steals this movie. Spielberg did a great job on bringing Kubrick's vision to light. It is a shame that Kubrick died before he could finish this masterpiece. Recomended for people with open minds.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Two of the greatest American films ever made and a third that is pretty good but suffers from the comparison to its predecessors. The extras are plentiful and add to the appreciation of these fine films. Definitely worth the purchase price and consideration for any film collection.
B00005RDSM|5.0|I love this movie because it makes you believe in magic and also makes you believe in Neverland. Where only your dreams and imagination and pixie dust take you!<BR>I also have seen Peter Pan in Return To Neverland and I loved it. I just wish that they still had the old character, the crocidile that Captian Hook was afraid of.<BR> I also have the soundtrack. For any of you who loved the songs and music in the original Peter Pan I advise you to buy it. I love it. Every night I listen to it!<BR> If you have children it would be a treat for them to listen to the magic that Disney has for them.
B000002U9W|4.0|I didn't care much for the long title track or 'Alans Psychedelic breakfast', but two songs make this album worth buying the exellent 'If' by Waters and 'Fat Old Sun' by Gilmour. 'If' in particular highlights Waters' lyrical Prowess.<BR>If your in To Floyd - It's a must.
1577311523|5.0|I have read many authors on the subject of spiritual enlightenment and I thought I understood presence, I thought I knew presence. However this book made the difference between knowing the path and walking the path. Yes, the book provides many answers to many questions but it is the gaps between the words that contain the real message. Living in the now has bought a sense of peace and happiness into my life that I have never experienced before and it was Eckhart Tolle who finally pointed me to what was always here.
B00005U122|5.0|having bought the live cd I have been waiting for the dvd to come out for ages - and it still isn't out in the UK - so I got impatient and bought the NTSC dvd. It's awesome, I've got my ticket for when they play in London in June.
B000005RHR|5.0|I'll try not to cover what's been said before in so many rewviews.  What moves me in this cd is the deph of emotions and musical craftsmenship.  An exelent cd to work, think, sleep, dance, or most of all make love to.  As the music moves, so in the state of consciousness will you too progress.  Movement, so jentle yet so compelling.
B00005V0X5|5.0|I Love This Album. Hell Yeah. What an awesome re-master. This is the best debut by any Metal Band so if you like metal this is for you. This is by far Megadeth's most unique album. It is not like anything they have made or anything anyone else has made. It is probably the most original album ever. This is the only album by Megadeth that I consider Speed Metal. PSBWB, SFSGSW, RIP, are all thrash albums. Just listen to the riff on rattlehead and you will know what I am talking about. The best songs are Skull Beneath the Skin and looking down the cross. They are all good traks but those two stand out for me. Skull Beneath the Skin has great lyrics and is so damn heavy. Looking Down The Cross shows Megadeth's great Musicianship. Buy this album today, you will not be disapointed. As soon as you hear the piano intro to Last Rites/ Loved to death, you will instantly be hooked.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie, winner of the 2001 Golden Globe for Best Actress, Best FILM and many other things, has to be the most amazing movie rleased in the previous year.<br />The use of colour, light, music, motifs and technology knock all other films out of water.<br />I can't understand why people don't like this movie. Kidman and McGregor have such beautiful chemistry on screen that it makes it complelety believable. I can hardly describe it in words.<br />If you like FILM ( not chick-flicky  escapist &quot;movies&quot; ) then you WILL love Moulin Rouge.
B00005U1YO|5.0|Songs like &quot;Pioneer Skies&quot;, &quot;Star Guitar&quot; (which has an awesome video, too), &quot;Hoops&quot;, &quot;Come With Us&quot;, &quot;The State We're In&quot; and &quot;The Test&quot; all blew me away!  I love every second of this CD!<br />For the past seven years, each Chemical Brothers album has continued to do nothing but impress me with new styles and sounds.  While the foundation of their music remains firm, they still find new ways to create some of the best, most amazing music that can be enjoyed.<br />Every Chemical Brothers album is a classic and worth owning.  &quot;Come With Us&quot; is most definitely not an exception!
B00003CXDZ|1.0|There was one major problem about this movie. It left me with one important unanswered question, \\"What the hell did I just watch!?\\" This is one of the most disturbing movies of all time yet everyone seems to love it. I wonder how much in royalties the creators had to pay to use all those songs they \\"borrowed\\". They combine Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", Lady Marmalade, the Can Can song, and some hideous rap song to create the most disturbing and freakish opening musical number ever. I was severely disappointed in this \\"Oscar Worthy\\" film. To end on a better note Ewan McGregor was the only thing that made this film worthy of the manditory One-Star. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!
B000002J27|4.0|With the departure of Peter Gabriel many thought Genesis was in trouble.  They weren't.  As the opener &quot;Dance On A Volcano&quot; shows Genesis were in top form, creating an instant classic.  &quot;Entangled&quot; flows smoothly along with &quot;Squonk&quot;, a very interesting number.  Phil Collins voice is superb, along with stunning guitar from Hackett and bass from Rutherford.  Tony Bank's keeys are off the hook as usual, and the songs he contributes are all of high quality. The album closes with &quot;Los Endos&quot;, a nice little summary of the album.   Overall, the album is full of high exciting points, and only seldomly, are there lows.  This is a must have for any Genesis fan.
0399229191|5.0|For a very long time this book was my daughter's favorite.  She loves having it read to her (especially when you do all the animal voices) and she thoroughly enjoys running her fingers across the raised spider's web on every page.  We have shared this book together dozens and dozens of times.  It is especially endearing to the 2-3 year old crowd.
B00005JKQX|5.0|A wonderful movie about a remarkable individual - very moving.  Russell Crowe's performance is spectacular.  If you're looking for fast paced action and blood and gore, it's not for you.  I highly recommend it.
B00003CX5P|4.0|BUT in the meantime Episode I ROCKS. This DVD set looks and sounds wonderful. Even though I don't think the movie lives up to episode's 4, 5 & 6. It is a very fun and action packed movie, with fantastic special effects. The extras are fun as well, I love the deleted LONG race seen, its very funny. I am looking forward to seeing Attack of the clones and I especially can't wait for the original three (episodes 4, 5, and 6) to come out on DVD.
B000002MFE|5.0|Relaxed, intimate, good quality R n B, a whimscal style.. Who could ask for more and Clapton certainly delivers the goods, and who can deny the quality emotion provoking songs such as 'Tears in Heaven' and 'Lonely Stranger'
B00005UEAR|5.0|I've seen a few negative reviews popping up here and there, so I thought I better tip the balance on the positive side. First of all, we need to understand that this is a departure - but what Dream Theater album isn't? The beauty of this band is that they are constantly challenging their own style, sound, and talent. And that is what will ultimately make them timeless.<br />Is this my favorite DT album? Hard to say. I'm a big fan of concept albums, so, for me, Scenes From A Memory will be hard to beat. What I like about this album is that it features two very distinctive styles on two very different discs. Disc 1 features a heavier style with 5 lengthy, multi-layered songs which are short on structure and high on talent. Disc 2, on the other hand, features a softer, more orchestrated and melodic style with 1 extended song, written in multiple parts, and telling a story throughout.<br />In short, fans of Awake, Falling Into Infinity, and the Liquid Tension Experiment albums will probably be more attracted to Disc 1. Fans of Scenes From A Memory and the recent Jordan Rudess solo album will probably be more attracted to Disc 2. If you're like me and love both of these styles, you'll love the whole album.<br />As far as melody, Misunderstood wins hands-down on Disc 1. I find myself playing this track over and over again. Unlike many other fans of progressive rock, I'm a sucker for a memorable chorus - so this song drew me in from the first listen. The rest of the disc is something to appreciate, but I really don't find myself remembering any of the songs very well. Still, they are solid songs which will not dissapoint DT fans.<br />Disc 2, on the other hand, is full of melody, memorable hooks, and chilling orchestrations. Solitary Shell is the stand-out song on this disc, although my only complaint is that it sounds a bit too much like Peter Gabriel's \\"Solsbury Hill\\". In any case, it's a great song and it's the one I keep going back to on Disc 2. The remainder of Disc 2uses typical concept album tricks (recurring melodies, interesting storylines, etc.) but uses them extremely well. Again, fans of Scenes From A Memory are sure to keep Disc 1 in the case, and Disc 2 in the CD player.<br />Overall, Dream Theater is alive and well and as talented as ever. But, most importantly, they're still breaking new ground, telling new stories, and inspiring new generations of musicians to push their own limits. How can anyone be critical of that?
B00000634J|3.0|It is one of those rare Lennon collection albums with a comprehensive body of his work from 'Plastic Ono Band' to 'Milk and Honey', which is good, but sadly I think some of his best work, 'Woman', 'Starting Over', 'Nobody Told Me' was towards the end, true he did some classics at the start of the seventies and I wouldn't knock that but 1980 showed that Lennon was entering a new musical phase and attitude which was sadly uncompleted.
6301972139|5.0|The 1952 version of Moulin Rouge is truly a masterpiece. It captures the struggles and the life of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec beautifully. I found the movie profoundly touching as it displayed the pain felt by Henri as he searched for love and friendship, but could not find any that did not prey on his money. It also showed how he made his famous lithographs and paintings. I encourage everyone to see this movie... and to view the art of Toulouse-Lautrec as well!!!
B00005UEAR|2.0|As a HUGE DT fan, I was really disappointed by this disc. Is ego ruining DT? This double album would've been a better single album with a good 30 minutes of excessive garbage. Particularly Rudess' overture in disc 2 is just torture. His key sounds have always been suspect, and this album punctuates that. I agree that Portnoy really needs to stop singing: who told him he could sing?? Mike, you're an awesome drummer (possibly the best of your generation), but you can't sing!! The songs are overall pretty weak, and really the only pleasure is listening to the pyrotechnics intersperesed in the songs (but it's usually a long wait for even these tidbits). <BR>The most offensive bit was the song that preaches to us about embryonic stem cell research. Are you kidding me?? While I understand DT's religious leanings, until now I've been able to listen without offense since they tend to be unobtrusive. But the overbearing right-of-center preaching was really too much: i cringe and skip this song as soon as it starts (they should make a non-Moral Majority version of the disc with this song deleted). I certainly respect their opinions, but I really don't want to be preached to when I'm listening to music, and particulary on such a complicated issue that reasonable people can disagree on).  Guys, if you want to preach, do it in church and at home, otherwise leave us out of it (unless you'd rather we stop buying the discs, which I have to say I'll probably do-I'm honestly so offended I'm thinking of returning the disc).<BR>All in all very disappointing: probably only apppropriate for the hard-core fans (I used to be one until this disc) and pro-lifers. Otherwise, save your money and hope they return to their brilliance of the past.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|INCREDIBLE art work showing the advancement of the film and its making. A MUST HAVE for any disney fan. I also enjoyed the radio commercials advertising the film throughout the years.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is one of the most exceptional movies i have ever seen. Thank you Baz Luhrman for thinking it up and Nicole Kidman and Ewan MgGregor for giving such amazing performance's. And as for you people who rated this movie horribly but didnt watch it (Ghost rider) you shouldnt talk becasue the beggining was a little hectic and for a good reason. Anyone who says this movies was quick and jumps around too much has obviously not seen more then the first 15 minutes nor did they see what Baz Luhrman was trying to show the audience.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you ever believed in truth, beauty, freedom and above all, LOVE, buy this DVD!  I've watched mine a dozen times and I love it more every time I watch it.  I'd become a Ewan McGregor fan after seeing his angelic portrayal of Christian on the big screen and ended up being a HUGE Baz Luhrman fan after viewing the DVD.   You've never experienced a more perfect dramatic presentation of innocent love!  Top Hats off to Baz!
0451149513|5.0|great book nice start everything you look for in the book. I also seen the movie and its scary and mystery, but like in the 8th page they talk about this turtle but the turtle gave me clues to if the turtle came out in diffrent horror books. Great book.<BR>Sincerly Jesse Garcia
B0000011MT|5.0|The band's album On the Shore is one of the great albums of rock history, so it seems odd to give The Garden of Jane Delawney the full five stars: how many could one give to On the Shore? In truth, however, this much more modest offering is probably overall just as good, and the title track (covered by the band All About Eve, but losing a deal of the magic in the process) alone is worth the price of the CD. The Garden of Jane Delawney was re-released in the UK in early 2002 by BGO (Beat Goes On), and it is much to be hoped that there's a similar re-release in the USA soon.
B00000G3HZ|5.0|I just saw it again on tv and was moved to write a review.  This has got to be one of the top ten films for me.  It's touching, the scenery is breathtaking, and the actors are simply excellent.  They are all so good that I can't even point to one, except that I did think Kevin Kline's accent absolutely [stunk] and as a Southern belle born and bred, I am qualified to comment on that!!  Yes, they may not be the most admirable of characters but they remind me of my friend's older brothers and sisters who did come of age in the 60s and acted just like this.
6304806442|4.0|Being the huge Ewan fan I am I had to see this movie.  Also being the broke teenager I am I had to watch it at 5:45 in the moring on t.v.  It was an excellent choice to wake up early to watch it!<br />The acting is great and so is the directing!  This is a must-see and if you don't see it your misisng out!
158234082X|4.0|One of the great lessons of this book is that there is about as much relationship between cooking and being a chef as there is between being a clothing designer and someone who wears clothes. Anthony Bourdain vividly describes the personalities, pathologies, high crimes, misdemeanors, and ultimately talent, of the those who work in our fine restaurants. After reading this book, I will never be without a handful of shallots, and never order seafood on Monday. And if I ever decide to commit a crime against another person, I shall use as my defense their disturbance of my mis en place, and fall on the mercy of the court. <br />This book is both funny and disturbing--and a must-read for those who think it would be \\"fun\\" to own their own restaurant. It falls short of five-star status only because the last 40 or so pages could have been lopped off, with no damage to the essence--or the humor--of the book.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Okay, the main reason I rented this movie was to see how it would compare to its fellow Oscar nominees.  At first I was freaked out, but as the story and singing continued, I really enjoyed it.  You have to have a feel for the theatre and for a musical to really enjoy this.  There were a few factors that were off-setting and unusual, but in the end:  not that bad of a movie!
B00005U8EM|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies and I was very excited to see it released as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD. <br />Unfortunately, while it's still a GREAT story -- this version of the DVD really doesn't have that many whistles and bells. It gives you the option to have Harold Ramis (the director) do a voice over during the movie and it has a brief documentary about the concept behind the movie. Andie McDowell and the guy who plays &quot;Ned the Insurance Man&quot; were the only actors they got to speak about the making of this movie. It was very disappointing to have Bill Murray missing, or even Chris Elliot for that matter.<br />One would think this movie had plenty of funny outakes -- but  they are AWOL as well.<br />Buy this DVD if you love the movie &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; -- but don't expect much in the way of extras.
B00005TT77|1.0|I wish I hadn't spent my money on this CD without first hearing it.  Even the better tracks sound like they were done in one take.  I'll try to sell it at my first garage sale.  Next time-download! &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; were total train wrecks.
B00005A46T|5.0|This cd is just plain awsome. I have no complaints about it and im pretty sure if your into heavy metal you will like it too. If your iffy about it download 1 or 2 of there good songs which i personally like the songs Heritic Anthem and People=Sh*t.
0380788624|3.0|Stephenson's novel sprawls, lurches, speeds, then tails away.  There are two or three very tight concise novellas competing for one's attention. And the sum is somewhow less than its glittering parts. <BR>Nabokov, in &quot;Despair&quot;, had a passage where the narrator writes, &quot;must be calm, keep my head.  No good going on otherwise.  Quite calm. Chocolate, as everybody knows...(let the reader imagine here a description of its making).&quot; <BR>I cite this reservation uncomfortably:  Stephenson goes to great lengths to establish creditability of intellectual characterization. Many of the asides, in and of themselves, would serve the characters well.  But over the course of the novel as a whole, I question how much is characterization per-se, and how much is Stephenson showing his props or simply showing off.<BR>Someday this guy is going to write a gem for all time.  This novel isn't it, but it's a remarkable start in the right direction.
B00000I0XW|2.0|The recording quality on this disc is generally sub-par. On one track her voice bounces back and forth between the channels. She sounds like a human ping-pong ball!! I must admit that one thing colors my review and that is that I am not a big fan of show music. I prefer Brightman's more recent works, &quot;Time To Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Eden&quot;. &quot;La Luna&quot; wasn't too bad, but some of the song selections were rather dull. Buy this one only if you are a huge ALW fan, because Sarah does much better on her other discs.
B00005QG9J|2.0|This CD is decent.  Really, after the first three tracks it takes a dive.  The lyrics are pretty weak, the music is all right.  Nice to Know You and Circles are their best efforts on this.  I know it was overplayed but I Wish You Were Here isn't that bad, it's all right.  The rest of the album isn't bad, it's just boring and bland.  Their previous works (even Make Yourself, because the music was still active and interesting and the lyrics were still great) were fabulous showcases of their talent and ability.  Morning View is just a bland attempt at trying to have melody.  Maybe a 12 year old thinks this music is profound, amazing, and/or hard, but not anyone who knows what those words mean and what this band is about.  As people have stated before, buy all their albums, then buy this.  It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good.
B00004RD54|5.0|This album is so good it's not hard to see why even someone as egotistical as Lou used to be, after years of dismissing it finally conceded that it is pretty good after all <br />Just turn the music up loud and let it take you away and don't be alarmed if you get a drug-free high. <br />(If you're not familiar with the Velvet Underground try \\"Sister Ray\\" from the White Light/White Heat album, a masterpiece from an earlier era of Lou).
B00005QZ7U|5.0|no matter how you like it(or not), it's still one of the more intersteing movies in recent momory. This is the first dvd I've ever purchesed since I got my dvd drive, and I've to say the sound and the picture qulity are quite stunning on my little flat screen tv and my semi-high end audio system. This alone worth the price of the dvd.
B000056H24|5.0|THRE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD may not be the best film ever made on the life of Jesus, but it's darn near close! Fine acting with breathtaking visual effects makes this film one that never ceases to entertain or inform! Max Von Sydow is a good actor, and his performance in this film as the Messiah is exceptional (his best ever.). And he is helped by an awe-inspiring cast (including Charlton Heston, Telly Savalas, Rody McDowell and John &quot;Duke&quot; Wayne), and the brilliant use of portions of Handel's masterpiece &quot;MESSIAH,&quot; as well as a brilliant score by Alfred Newman. This film is amazing, and now it is preserved in it's breathtaking Cinescope Widescreen Format (2.75:1 Aspect Ratio), and has enough special features that'll keep you involved until Jesus returns, and He WILL RETURN! God be praised! Grade: A+
6305910103|5.0|I love this Movie! It is perhaps one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. I do enjoy Star Trek, but I would not consider myself  to be a \\"Trekkie.\\"<br />This movie just flat out has it all: character development, action, effects, moments of awe, and scientific intrigue.<br />As Kirk says to his trainees, \\"We have been though death and life together.\\" You will go through the range of emotions while viewing this movie. And if you fallow up this film with a healthy dose of \\"Star Trek III the Search for Spock\\" the story will come full circle. Space opera at its' very best.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Could it be the swift guitar chords, or the soulful lyrics. For any reason, John Mayer's Debut album, &quot;Room For Squars&quot; shows off the ability of a young man all packaged in one Cd. Many songs such as, No such Thing, are surely radio/top 40 hits, and MY stupid mouth is so true. YOu can relate to this CD to your everyday life. It has surely changed mine. :D
0451160916|5.0|...in a hundred years. <br />And yet, it is so much more than a horror/supernatural novel. <br />King's writing is excellent, easy to understand, nto overcomplicated, and so you can power through it easily and quickly. <br />The characters are great, and the way Jack Torrance's ever increasing madness is described is masterful. It's a fantastic book. Simply. <br />The mood is distinctly claustrophobic, tethered with hints of dark depression. However, the hope which shines through right at the end is wonderful. <br />The beginning of the book tends towards being a bit slow, but that's fine, as it admirably sets the scene and mood, which is something all books need. And the ending is stunning. Probably the best ending King has come up with. Simply great. <br />I can't really think of how to describe this book...so i won't. Just rest assured that if you like a good exciting read, this is definitely the one for you. Haunting, atmospheric, scary, chilling. Read, read, read.
0345440757|4.0|I definately recommend this book!  My husband and I both read it from cover to cover before our baby was born.  (I was amazed he was willing to read it.)  We followed it very closely.  Our son is now eight months old and I cannot tell you how many times I hear &quot;is your son always that happy?&quot; or &quot;he is so content!&quot;.  My husband and I both feel that this book really saved us during those first few weeks with our new son.  I am now going to purchase her toddler book.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Episode 1 is a MAJOR disappointment from the get go. It's not even worth 1 star, but I could not figure out how to give it a poorer rating. It lacks none of the depth and vision that the the 3 earlier movies did, and the story line is WEAK! The best part of the movie, and the sole reason why I bought it, is because of Jar Jar Bink's humourous antics. The robots with their stupid \\"roger, roger\\" are arsinine! And it is ludicrous for the technology to be \\"better\\" in the prequel, and worse in the supposedly subsequent movies. Episode 1 is more of a comedy than anything else. George: this movie is nothing more than a greedy attempt on your part to rip the die-hard Star Wars fans off. Aren't you rich enough already? Why don't you get with the programme and make the next movie a little more sensible? And please, take those stupid robots out of there.
B000023VR6|4.0|On this album Dre makes a comeback in the game since he left 'bout 5 years ago! It's actually more of a Westside reunion, I mean allmost every west-rapper is on here doing his (or her) thing! The production by Dr Dre himself is good like allways but I don't know for sure about his deliverance... I mean, he might be a very good producer and one of the most important guy's in in the business but his flow is prety wack most of the album! I like dr.dre on some joints like &quot;Forgot about dre&quot; and &quot;still DRE&quot; where he deliveres great but mostly... But the many guest appearances makes that up, believe me, he has practically the whole Westcoast on his album and they all do a great job! I especially enjoyed Eminem, Snoop and Hitman on most of the songs! Another slightly bad thing is that no matter there are so many hits and dope tracks on it, it still gets bored very soon! But if you put it away then for a while and listen to it later you can still enjoy it! The best tracks on here are &quot;F#*k you&quot;, &quot;Still DRE&quot;, &quot;The Watcher&quot;, &quot;Forgot about dre&quot; wich has one of the thightest beats I ever heard, &quot;Next episode&quot; and &quot;Bang Bang&quot;! Everyone probably already owns this album but if you don't I can realy recommend it to you!
630469654X|5.0|Original review from 2002:<br /><br />The music is a bit different than some might expect and thus it might throw you off. But this movie has a great tragic storyline and a great message about the power of Good. Suffice it to say, the movie ends with a happy note. This turned out to be somewhat of a chick flick that my wife liked because the basic premise of the movie is one big love story. Thus, men and women alike should enjoy this one.<br /><br />Update:<br />&#62; I'm okay with the 70's style soundtrack, though it does throw a person off a bit<br /><br />+ Matthew Brodrick is a bumbling criminal, where his physical humor and expressions remind me of the old Jerry Lewis (accidental physical comedy) with Jackie Chan (intentional physical comedy)<br /><br />+ Michelle Pfieffer = It's Michelle and I first watched this when I was in high school. Hubba-hubba! Nuff said.<br /><br />+ Rutger Hauer = the brooding tragic hero...<br /><br />I can still go back to this movie and it's a love story that pulls you in. Since it takes place in medieval times, it feels like a fantasy story...and there are supernatural elements that make it so. Totally worth watching. . .some will want to own it.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|With out a doubt, the worst movie ever made!  Cluttered and ugly scenes drove me crazy!  At times I could almost see what the direct was trying to do.  But mostly it's just a very bad way to spent two hours!
B00005T343|5.0|I loved &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, the one of the handful of movies that scares the living daylights out of me. I read the book while the film version was still in its early stages. I was totally grossed out by what I read and I don't say that about just any book. The film version gave me the chills, not to mention repulsed me on the same level the novel did. I loved &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Granted that I would have loved to have seen Jodie Foster reprise her classic film role, Julianne Moore gave a stellar performance as Clarice Sterling. I thought she was perfect for Jodie's replacement. &quot;Hannibal&quot; may not be nearly as perfect as &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; in terms of quality, I still found it thoroughly engaging and entertaining. Ray Liotta's performance as that jerk Paul Krendler was just perfect. His character was a jerk in the book and a bigger jerk in the movie. Anthony Hopkins was and is Hannibal Lechter. He was still riveting and compelling to watch as he was in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger was priceless. He really gave me the creeps in the movie as the vengeful victim of Hannibal Lechter. For the most part, the movie stays faithful to the novel however for anyone who read the book before seeing the movie, you see the holes in the movie. Still it is rather difficult to make a film adaptation of a novel and keep it within a 2 hour limit. Despite the critics' desparaging reviews about the movie, I loved it and thought it was a worthy follow-up to a classic thriller.
B000059XYL|3.0|I didn't expect a lot from this movie, and it's certainly not Great Cinema, but it IS fun.  It's not thought-provoking, it's filled with T&amp;A (this will be a recommendation for some people, a warning for others), the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the plot carries more cliches than surprises.  But so what?  I just finished watching it and I'm smiling.  <br />Sometimes you want a movie that's full of people dancing and drinking and singing, full of pop songs that kind of make you want to dance around your living room, where the sweet innocent girl gets to be a little naughty but stay sweet and innocent, and where every character triumphs in some way.  This is one of those movies.  I will say that, despite the multiple female bodies on display (in minimal clothing, but always clothed), this strikes me as more of a girl movie than a guy movie.  The romance plot seems aimed at women, as does Violet's personal journey to overcome stagefright.  If you ever read those Sunfire romances when you were a teenager, this is one of those, dancing on a bar in leather pants and a halter top.
0446677450|4.0|This book will open your eyes and mind to a different way of thinking. At first I thought the author was &quot;off his rocker&quot; but as I read further it started making more and more sense. As others have pointed out, it is not so much a &quot;how to&quot; book as it is an approach to developing a mind-set of the rich. Some of the material is repiticious but maybe it was intentionally done to drive home some of the points Robert tries to make about his two dads. You will certainly look at assets and liabilities differently after reading this book and more than likely make some changes for the better in your life...and isn't that why you are considering the book? It was hard to put down and I was pleased with the read. I think you will be too.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I knocked off a star because of the standard-bubble gum pop this CD starts off with.  But starting with the sixth song (18 Wheeler), this song takes a totally different direction--one I hope that Pink focuses on because, at least in my not-so-humble opinion, my generation is lacking great musical talents and Pink can help to fill that void.<br />My favorite song on the CD, \\"Misery\\" (a duet with Steven Tyler) is a Blues song that would make B.B. King smile.  Pink has a powerful vocal range and puts emotion behind that stunning voice.  The alternative-sounding \\"Numb\\" is equally impressive.  \\"My Vietnam\\" touched me personally.  <br />Here's hoping that Pink's next CD focuses on such excellent songs, rather than \\"Get The Party Started,\\" and here is hoping that radio stations will play other cuts from this CD.
0792837614|1.0|So  \\"The gangs in the film represented TOTAL COOL to a young audience back then\\"?<br />Since when was the 1950s a beautiful era when the worst anyone had to fear was a troupe of ballet dancers? This was not cool in the 50s or any other era, Hell, most B movies from the 50s are probably square compared with what actually went on but they were clearly a damn sight more realistic because they weren't playing by Hollywood rules .West Side Story is pure Hollywood all the way, and 50's Hollywood was a propaganda machine -need I say more?<br />First, the music. Remember that rock& roll had been knocking about in various forms for a good many years before Elvis arrived, and  he actually had arrived by the time this was written. Delinquent slum kids would have been able to get hold of this music even if the middle class kids were being policed and we're hardly supposed to believe that they'd be listening to what's on offer here. The same goes for the dancing, a good dance hall scene would be one thing but what sort of gang is gonna be doing ballet on rooftops? I'm sorry, but that was not realism.<br />Secondly, the racial politics. The racism was greatly played down in the movie not only, I suspect, because of censorship but because the makers of the movie were attempting to gloss over the reality and not present it as a serious issue. The interracial love story is basically presented as a form of cultural smugness (one tribe which defeats another will keep the women for themselves rather than kill them, they remain a desirable commodity) Had this not have been tragedy, no doubt it would have followed the route of other interracial love stories made at the time, Maria, newly liberated by her love for the clean cut American, would have still been expected to fulfil the same roll, that of wife and mother, but the fact that Tony \\"respects\\" her would have made it perfectly acceptable.<br />The Jets, who are more clean cut and less threatening, are basically nice all American boys who look like they probably love mom's apple pie and play for the school football team. The Sharks are clearly more sexual, dangerous and glamorous and are of course portrayed as villains, other than the women of course.<br />Other points to note include the ending (not the same as in Romeo and Juliet on which it was based), the acting (Natalie Wood does not make a good Puerto Rican and quite frankly she puts no effort into making the portrayal realistic) and the fact that nobody, I don't think, sings for themselves. It's also very long and could have done with severe editing.<br />Verdict: If you are interested in the social climate of the 1950s you can learn a lot from the way this story is interpreted. If you want some hot interracial love and gang action then I can't yet recommend the right movie for you, but it sure as hell ain't this one!who look like they probably love mom's apple pie and play for the school football team.

0380817683|5.0|I'm an avid reader of all types of books, classics to contemporary, nonfiction and fiction, light and heavy.  Since \\"Bridget Jones\\" was published I've been enamored of \\"chick lit\\" books because of their potential as light reading that's more intelligent and relatable than most bestsellers.  Unfortunately, so few chick lit books have actually lived up to that potential (\\"The Perfect Elizabeth,\\" \\"Good in Bed,\\" \\"Milkrun\\"... all garbage).  Fortunately, with Marian Keyes, my search is over.  I don't know how she keeps turning out 500- and 600-page books that are so full of humor, great characters, and genuine emotion, but I'm SO glad she does.  \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" was the first of her books that I read, and I loved it, couldn't put it down, was sorry when it was over, and missed the characters for days afterward.  If you, like me, loved \\"Bridget Jones\\" and have been frustrated in your search for something as satisfying, try Marian Keyes.  You won't regret it.  Other Keyes novels I've read, and therefore recommend: \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" and \\"Sushi for Beginners\\"--the latter is available only in the UK, so give amazon.co.uk a try.
0060930349|3.0|As with all his books of history, Paul Johnson's great strength is his ability to show the characters of history as live people with strengths and weaknesses.  His very British prose style makes for enjoyable reading.  I would not recommend this book for beginners without a background in American history anymore than I would a left wing history of the U.S. because Johnson's opinions are so strong that the book occassionally lacks objectivity.  I found myself agreeing more with his views of the 19th and 18th centuries than with the 20th.  His description of Lincoln as a \\"kind of moral genius\\" is poetic and apt.  His high regard for the framers of the Constitution is a welcome respite from the annoying revisionism which has pervaded history in recent years.  He is very good at debunking myth. Thus the idea of the \\"robber barron\\" is deconstructed to some extent.  In the 20th century, I find myself in disagreement with him often.  There is nothing wrong with cutting FDR down to size.  His reputation is so overblown that it needs paring.  But he dismisses one of our greatest Presidents as a frivilous man and blames him for every mistake of his time while giving him little or no credit for his depression and wartime leadership.  This is unfair.  On a broader level, he seems to dismiss the entire progressive era of American history as either mistaken or irrelevant.  Although acknowledging the need for reforms in the post war period in the area of civil rights, he dwells on the negatives while largely failing to note the almost revolutionary change in the treatment of blacks in this country.    <BR>In short, the book is written from the perspective of a conservative ideologue and it hurts his analysis in some cases.  I enjoyed the book enormously but did not find it as good an analysis as I did \\"Modern Times\\", his fabulous history of the 20th Century.
B00005T30L|4.0|\\"Ghost World\\" is a rare movie find, a shrewdly observant tale of societal outcasts that, in its own low-keyed, understated way, offers profound insights into the workings of human nature.  It is rare to see a film this confident in its purpose and tone.  Writer/director Terry Zwigoff and co-writer Daniel Clowes have fashioned a tale totally lacking in the sort of sensationalistic melodrama that blights so many films dealing with the issue of teenage alienation and angst.  Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson portray Enid and Rebecca, two long time friends who have just been released from that prison known as high school and are now forced to make their way in a world full of people towards whom they feel utterly contemptuous.  Enid and Rebecca, like many youngsters who find it hard to fit in, camouflage their insecurities in a cloak of blas&eacute; cynicism, adopting a tone of superiority to all the \\"cool\\" people who have rejected them.  Indeed, to these two young women, even being \\"cool\\" is uncool, so they comfort each other with the knowledge that they are simply too good for the society around them.  The problem is that while this \\"pose\\" may suffice to get one through high school, it becomes a definite hindrance when one is confronted by the realities of life on the outside - finding a job, planning a future, establishing relationships.<br />In the latter department, Enid finds herself drawn to an awkward middle-aged man named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who is, in many ways, an older version of herself, a socially backward \\"dork\\" who frankly admits that the reason he collects so much memorabilia is because he prefers objects to people.  Enid and Seymour strike up a tentative relationship, but what makes \\"Ghost World\\" so extraordinary is that we never quite know where the story is going.  The writers don't go for the obvious plot turns so that, even by the end, although we leave the film feeling satisfied, we don't sense that all the loose ends have been tied up into a nice neat little package for our facile consumption.  In fact, it is the very ambiguous, open-ended nature of the film that makes it seem so truthful.  Even the characters remain strangely enigmatic throughout.  Rebecca begins to feel the stirrings of conformity as she starts working at a job and looking for an apartment in a conventional suburban neighborhood.  This tension causes the girls to start drifting apart, as does Enid's sudden interest in Seymour, a relationship Rebecca begins to view with a measure of jealousy and resentment.  Enid is also very recognizable in her refusal to confront the people who mean the most to her when times of conflict or crisis arise - preferring to let her answering machine cope with her problems for her, in the vain (but all too human) belief that by screening her calls she will also be screening herself from some of the problems she has helped to create.  We also see how these generally lost, but well-intentioned people, allow themselves to do very hurtful things to the people they love.  The emotional terrain of this film is surprisingly credible and complex.<br />As far as I can tell, there is really not an untrue moment in \\"Ghost World.\\"  It creates fascinating characters and remains true to them to the end, never requiring them to utter a false-sounding statement or indulge in cheap theatricalities to get the point across.  Birch, Johannson and Buscemi give dazzlingly understated performances, never missing a beat as they create this strangely charming \\"ghost world\\" full of people who feel unconnected to the corporeal world around them.

B00005UEAR|2.0|I'm a DT fan... always have been, always will be. With that said, I feel that I am still capable of writing an objective critique without being emotionally influenced because they are my favorite band. And my objective criticism leads to me to give this album 2.5 stars. <br />6DoIT seems to lack the inspiration that some of their other albums had. I was truly expecting a monumental masterpiece, especially after Scenes from a Memory. I loved DT before SFAM, but after hearing SFAM I couldn't believe that anyone could compose such a stunningly beautiful and inspired piece of music. The melodies are developed and utilized in ingeniously subtle ways to support the story of this progressive concept album, and every single note seems to have been intentionally crafted and placed, meaning that there were very few cliche or conflicting passages. Moreover, the lyrics are not cheesy. They meaningfully relate the story of Victoria's life and death, and the lyrics creatively fit into the music and in fact carry the melody quite well. All in all, all the songs and melodies and lyrics fit together like a tight glove... the album was well edited, and time was clearly spent on eliminating anything that clashed with the rest of the album, leaving a very cohesive album with great story, great lyrics, beautiful and original solos, and great band unity.<br />In contrast, 6DoIT almost annoyed me--especially the first disc. There is no real unifying concept. The lyrics are quite corny throughout--the \\"insanity\\" theme has been way overdone, reminding me of 80's fantasy cheese metal (think Dio's worst stuff). The music reminds me of Tool, and I swear that some of the heavier passages--and solos in particular--are straight from Megadeth (think of Rust in Peace, with some of Friedman's exotic Japanese scales utilizing lots of pulloffs and single string scales).  The one aspect of the music that annoys me the most is the lack of development of the melodies.  Call me a musical conservative, buta single \\"song\\"--no matter how long--should have some type of overarching melodic musical theme or lyrical message, like all the tracks in SFAM. If this isn't the case, then how can be the band be truly progressive? Any band can take a whole bunch of random riffs and string them into a 30 minute song, but it takes the talent of a good progressive band to string a single melody into 30 minutes of subtle nuances and interesting variations. Well, in 6D, a melody is fostered for maybe 4 or 8 bars, and then it is subsumed by another 8 bar riff that has a different flavor entirely. This is reminiscent of the early thrash metal (Metallica or Megadeth again) style, not a DT release.  Therefore, the songs seem to take random musical directions--some of the directions are awesome and intriguing, but 8 bars later they disappear. And they get tiring... Therefore, there are some places where I rewind the CD to listen to a particular 25 second section, then I'll fast-forward to another 8 bar section that I like. Basically, it sounds like Petrucci might have picked up his guitar for a few minutes, fiddled around with random riffs, put his guitar away, and then restarted the process the next day. Also, many of the riffs are cliche, and their technical tricks (like certain hooks and transitions) are cliche too. SFAM didn't have these cliche transitions--clever and original transitions are part of what define DT as musically original.<br />Instead of concentrating their efforts into an awesome, tight, cohesive 70 minutes like they did on SFAM, it seems they were more worried about volume. <br />Ironically, their musical mastery is their undoing in this particular case.  On the positive side, the music on this album is very complex and very detailed, typical of DT. So as usual I applaud them on their musical mastery, and that alone is enough to merit closer inspection of this album. But I suspect they spent more time worrying about how to record and produce 2 discs of complex music than they did composing and editing the music to be perfect.  The fact that some of the album was written among other projects (like the G3 tour) undoubtedly contributed to this undoing.<br />I don't know what else to say really. We all know what DT is capable of--especially technically--and after SFAM all shadow of doubt as to their composition and artistic prowess has been removed. But this album, while it is a technical masterpiece as always, lacks the artistic spirit and direction that I expect since SFAM.<br />If you want hard metal, it's already been done. We all know Megadeth. If you want Tool, listen to Tool. DT should be moving forward, not backward, and should be expounding their own style, not copying someone else's.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I love this CD.  It's fun, romantic, dramatic.  And Nicole and Ewan's voices are an incredible surprise.  Brilliant!  So what if some of the songs have been done.  They're now done in a fresh, new way.  I like the original music, too.  Unfortunately, none of it qualified for Oscar® nomination.  And now we'll have to listen to that extremely annoying Randy Newman instead.
B0000509C3|5.0|This movie is the best.This is one of King's best stories.I recommend this movie to every one who likes grusome films.The actors fit their parts.If you want a great movie to watch one night,then Children of the Corn is that movie.
B00005JKQX|3.0|Noble Prize winning mathematician John Nash's descent into schizophrenia is far more fascinating than his recovery in the heralded Ron Howard directed drama, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". Nash's delusions, which occupy most of the first half of the film, are frightening flashes of cimematography that startle the senses into belief in much the same way a schizophrenic's delusions would. The second half of the film, his recovery, offers much less in cinematic value as Nash buries himself in mathematical equations as his delusions become less aggressive but forever present. Russell Crowe is the epitome of a schizophrenic Math professor almost to the point of amusing caricature, but the performance is disciplined excellence. Jennifer Connelly, as his wife seems merely there, no more or less than the sympathetic role offers, (I'm in the minority here). Her atrocious make-up in the final scenes, some forty years later, make her look like The Bride of Frankenstein. I would like to have seen Nash's groundbreaking work on economic theory better explained, even in layman's terms. It would have added much to his abandonment of reality. The inevitable emotional summation of Nash accepting The Noble Prize before throngs of applauding admirers was a bit anticlmactic. I mostly however enjoyed this film.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|The music sets the mood for the entire film, very well acted, written and directed.  I don't know how someone can say they didn't add the deleted scenes when it was obvious that they did?  Putting them in the movie versus leaving them out to me is better, I know I have several DVD movies that do that and I never end up watch the deleted scenes.  Why when you already watched the movie?  I especially like the way the played the music as if it was played on  a vinyl record versus CD.  This is definetly a must buy movie.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I didn't see Shrek in the theater. When I got the DVD for Christmas, I wasn't expecting much, but I have to say that it is just plain, side splittingly funny! The characters have depth, the story isn't the cliche you expect it to end on -- it's great.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was immediately captured from the opening curtain parting showing the old 20th Century Fox logo to the final credits and their inspirational ending with what the film was about -- especially love. Inspirational, brilliant, awe-inspiring-- I cannot find yet the right adjectives to bring this film to its highest praise. I watched it again after the first time and if I didn't have to get dinner done I'd have watched it a third time immediately. I cannot understand others being so perfunctory in their disdain about this film. To have watched only ten minutes and than given up is obscene. And it is doubly obscene to write a review about something you haven't seen in its entirety. Kidman is phenomenal as are all the others in the cast. Maybe the reviewers who disliked it so are too young to remember being a part of the bohemian life long ago. I spent my teens and 20's in the village and the Left Bank in Paris at Deux Magots and the Sorbonne drinking wine, pernoud, reading poetry and enveloping the beauty of art around me. But that can't be. I know a wonderful young lady who loved this movie. Amber is from Memphis, TN, and I'm proud of her for having the insight that all these others don't. Her heart must be at Deux Magots listening to poetry. People--see this movie again and again until you finally understand what it's all about. If you don't you will be missing one of life's wonders and you will be all the less for it. Don't cheat yourselves out of being loved in return.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Yep, many people cried in this movie, proclaimed it as &quot;one of the most touching, heartfelt movies ever&quot;.<br />I think not. But that's just me. I have many reasons why I gave this movie such a low rating. Firstly, it didn't live up to its hype. It was supposed to be a movie depicting the events that took place at Pearl Harbor, but then it seemed to me as if it focused more on the cliched love triangle between the leading roles than what it claimed to.<br />*takes back the tissue* And it even failed to touch me very much, even with 2 hours of non-stop emotion.<br />The 2 stars came from the brief war scene, its pseudo-saving grace.<br />I don't recommend this film, lest you're into romance and such. Or if you liked Titanic.
B00001OH1S|4.0|I absolutely love this &quot;chick&quot; movie, the only reason I decided to buy the soundtrack was because the movie was so great.  This soundtrack is a lot better than I expected it to be.  Great!
B000059QYB|4.0|This greatest hits collection marks the best of Billy Idol's solo career from Dancing with myself to shock to the system. It provides a great history the singer's career. There are also two other songs. The live version of rebel yell is OK, but then again it is acousitic-not the best format for punk. The cover of don't you forget about me is good. I just wish Idol would release some new music in the future.
0060925000|5.0|I read \\"A Suitable Boy\\" when it first came out back in 1993 and I have been recommending it to friends and avid readers ever since. Many people would find reading a 1,400 page book a daunting task, but in this case it is pure pleasure. I, like a friend of mine, began to ration out the final chapters dreading to see the story come to an end. I loved the characters (especially Lata's mother) and the love story that is basically the heart of this novel. By the time I finished this book, I felt like these characters were friends that I knew and, I must admit, felt a great deal of sorrow to have to let them go. Seth's language is rich and transports you to 1950s India, giving you the sights and smells of the places in which he is placing you as the reader. I heard about the time the book was released that Merchant/Ivory (\\"A Room With a View\\") had bought the film rights to this book. I'd love to see them adapt this work for the big screen. In the meantime, I think I'll just re-read it. Pick up this book....you won't look back!
B000002BUY|5.0|This is, to date, Incubus' best album. They didn't become famous because of this album (that was Make Yourself, which wasn't bad either). This is one of the few CDs that I can continue listening to without skipping any tracks because I love every single one of them. ^_^<br />Even the lyrics are rather snazzy, unlike the overdone lyrics that are splashed throughout the music market today.<br />This album also shows the range that every band member has, but what really, really impressed me was DJ Lyfe. In a time when incorporating turntabling was just awakening, this guy was already opening some cans of whoopass. :P<br />Fantastic album.
B00005U1YO|3.0|Buy this if you are a huge Chem fan (as I guess I am) or if you are looking for a decent electronica album.  That being said, this album breaks little to no new ground.  It's basically laid out like all the other Chem albums: the obligatory Beth Orton chill-out number and the Richard Ashcroft cameo.  Btw, the last song absolutely ...!  \\"Come with us\\" is the best track imho.  Other than that this is enjoyable but not memorable.
B00005JGAF|5.0|Besides the Beatles, the Ramones were the best rock band ever. Why? Neither band compromised on anything they did. This album encompases their best effort. Their junior outing produced a professional sounding album before that got bored with the sound they made famous and started to experiment (like the acoustical parts of Road To Ruin).<BR> Just fast catchy tunes that that don't sound juvenile or rushed. If your new to the Ramones, you could try this album first, though most will try 'Ramones Mania', and that will do fine. But when you want more to explore, start here.<BR> Plus, this album is as a whole, is also on 'All The Stuff And More Part 2', and includes Road To Ruin too.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The movie was good, with lots of the book included, however, a lot was left out. They missed two Quiddich scens, Norbert's life was horrably left out, and a few charecters were missing from the movie. However, the original movie was over four hours long, and it is being advertized as if that is being put back into the movie. With an extra two hours to put all the detail I mentioned into the movie, it should be exelent, hence, my 5 star rating.
6303039456|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theatre when it first came out. It's the heart-warming true story behind the 1988 Jamaican bobsled team. After jumping through numerous hoops such as racial discrimination, a coach with a shady past, and a rickety bobsled, they land themselves a bobsledding spot in the Winter Olympics, something Jamaica never had before. <BR>John Candy gives a stellar performance, unfortunately it was one of his last. At times he's comical, while others, more dramatic. He's a character easy to fall in love with. I miss him. <BR>Overall, Cool Runnings teaches the fundamentals of determination and never letting anything come between yourself and your dreams. Even when catastrophy ended the Jamaican's third bobsled run, they still got up and carried their sled across the finish line. Even if their time didn't earn a gold medal, their heart did.
B00005LIN0|5.0|George and Ira Gershwin wrote, in my opinion, the finest American opera of the last century.  It is supremely melodic, intensely dramatic, provides at least eight first-rate roles for performers and (having seen the opera at least four other times in other productions) experiencing it, in this gorgeous Trevor Nunn production, is a treat I did not ever expect to see.<br />First, the cast:  Every single person in the huge company can sing and act.  But special mention must go to  Willard White (Porgy)-- a proud, strong, handsome man who projects his love and spirituality and his life as an outsider in his actions and wonderful baritone voice.  Cynthia Haymon, is a gorgeous Bess.  Her first scenes as Crown's drunk, addicted, whore/lover are performed beautifully--then her 'redemption' as Porgy's lover is wonderful to see and hear.  Her lovely, strong soprano voice, her movements, her acting all change before our eyes.     Gregg Baker is the perfect Crown.  Not only is he a commanding singer, he is a commanding presence:  big, powerfully built and extremely handsome.  It is quite obvious how he could be both sexually exciting and absolutely frightening to Bess and all the other characters.  Damon Evans is superb as Sporting Life the one character who depends more on acting than classical singing.  This is not to say that Evans cannot sing.  He does wonderfully with his two numbers which are, granted, more musical comedy-inspired than opera-inspired. And his acting could not possibly be bettered.<br />The production by theatre-director Trevor Nunn (\\"Les Miserables,\\" among countless others) is thoughtful and true to the creators' intentions.  With his designers he has built a \\"Catfish Row\\" that is filled with heat, intensity, comedy, drama and, ultimately, tragedy.  His staging of the orchestral prelude is the best, most interesting I've seen.  The camera peeks into the lives of these ordinary people who depend on extremely hard work and few pleasures to exist.  Several moments have stayed with me long after my first viewing:  a first act fight in which Crown violently kills another character (Robbins)with a cotton hook, staged and filmed so realistically that one would think these were stunt people and not opera singers; performances by all of the few white people in the cast (Mr. Archdale & the Undertaker, for example) in which they do not 'talk down' to the African American characters (as I've seen in several other productions) but talk simply man to man; the way that the camera is tight on Bess's unbelieving face when Porgy silently (through the music) offers her his room to hide in when everyone else has turned her away; another close up:  this time on Sporting Life watching the crippled Porgy summon the strength to kill Crown with his bare hands. And finally  toward the end of the opera, when Sporting Life seduces Bess with drugs and his fantasy tale of what New York City will mean to her.<BR>The London Philharmonic brilliantly led by Sir Simon Rattle is perfect in both the operatic and jazz sections. This is an altogether satisfying, majestic production both musically and dramatically. <br />I have read almost all of the other reviews for this DVD and, honestly, do not understand the overwhelming longing to see the Otto Preminger movie.  Poitier and Dandridge were not opera singers and the Gershwins wrote an OPERA.  This means that the two title characters would have to be dubbed by other singers or, if they did their own singing (and I, honestly, have no idea if they did or didn't) they would have to compromise this extraordinary music.<br />It is true that the syncing of lips and music is not always on target.  This bothered me terribly at first, but then I found so much to love and admire about this production that it made little difference to me.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
6302759110|2.0|The movie's effects are great, of course they are, but you need substance and not just style in a movie. It seems that Coppola, a washout since Apocalypse Now, forgot that he needs a plot as well to give the drama of the visuals weight. Otherwise the choral music and the rivers of blood just come off as silly. Rarely does the film mix the psychological and the visual, and in it's selfconciousness to cover this MAJOR fault up, this being the fault of not having a solid story, the visuals come off as gags more than anything else. I don't mind gore, but it needs a reason other than just gore, and this is especial to a horror movie to elevate it above the usual silly crap that's supposed to really scare you. Anybody with half a brain recoginzes that psychological suspense and horror is infinetly more frightening than the sight of blood, and rarely does this film combine the two. It has all the flair in the world, but a movie needs a story to match it's plot. Rent/Buy Rosemary's Baby instead.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Loaded with material (although not a DePalma commentary), and containing a great film besides, this movie's a bargain.<BR>First, the movie itself.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is one of those movies that really captures high school in a nutshell.  From the opening sequence, DePalma shows a willingness to display the beautiful and the ugly side-by-side.  The opening sequence is loaded with beautiful young women running around in various states of undress...followed by one of the most stomach-churning scenes of social abuse and rejection ever put on the screen (for my money, &quot;plug it up&quot; is up there with &quot;squeal like a pig&quot; in terms of a phrase loaded with horror.)<BR>But DePalma doesn't get lost in the social aspects, he knows he has to create more than just social horror.  He also delivers the standard violence.<BR>None of this would have worked without Sissy Spacek, who both looked the part and anchored the movie with her vivid and believable performance.  This movie also marks the first and only time Travolta's ever been convincing as a bad guy; his character here is a small part, but frightening and, in a lot of ways, accurate.  This launched them both into wider success, it should be noted, not to mention being good for DePalma.<BR>Here is a good segway to get into the disc.  It has features like &quot;Acting Carrie&quot;, a short but informative chat with Spacek and others, and a couple of other featurettes that could stand to be longer but don't skimp on the honesty or information.  There's even a small bit on &quot;Carrie: The Musical&quot;, probably one of the more misguided Broadway stage shows.  No clips of the songs, unfortunately, but at least this disaster is being acknowledged.<BR>The transfer is sharp, and the audio mix is wonderful.  This movie is a bargain, and should be in your collection, even if you're not a horror fan.
B00005YTFG|1.0|The usual gripe -- how can the nominating committee give a film the nod as best picture and fail to nominate the director in that category? -- is a topic of current debate regarding Moulin Rouge and Lurhmann.  It is an outrage, but not the outrage most reviewers think it is.  The nominating committee was half right.  It neglected to nominate Luhrmann; it ought also to have given the film a pass.<br />Luhrmann is, it seems to me, the Cecil B. Demille of the current batch of MTV-inspired directors and his gimmicky film is as likely to be well-regarded twenty-thirty years hense as are the over-blown Demille creations.  Both made films that are vastly overstated, under-acted and over-rated.<br />Finally, while I'm a Nicole Kidman fan, if she deserved a nomination as best actress, it ought to have come for her performance in the better -- by far -- Other film she made last year.
B00005R5YN|4.0|This album is a surpise.I did not buy Flaming Pie (the title maybe the reason why).I did not buy Run Devil Run (it didn't sound like too much fun). But I did buy this one! (Fun, Fun Fun). Seriously, this caught me totally by surprise. I bought it on cassette which is cool because it has two sides. Side 1 is all good. Even the ballads don't suck. The words are fine. Paul's songs have ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS! Actually they've often been worse.Go buy the new Dylan album and try to listen to it 10 times in a row (I don't think so). This album, however, bears repeated listening. Good Vocals.Good Bass.Good Guitar.Good Songs. If you think this album has bad lyrics go listen to some Lenny Kravitz. Did Band On The Run have good lyrics? How 'bout Jet? Side 2 is a little different (expiremental?) but it also ROCKS (relatively speaking) in spots.My ONLY problem with this album is that it may be 15 minutes too long. Riding Through Jaipur is a throwaway but it doesn't suck.The ten minute song may be Paul's Most Rockingest Song Ever but he shoulda wrote a few more versus.Heck even Freedom ain't that bad, especially coming after that noisefest. All in all a great album. DON'T MISS IT
0061020710|4.0|The book \\"Colour of Magic\\" is the first book in Terry Pratchetts Discworld book series, a series that just seems to never end.<BR>We're cleverly thrown into the story and learn about the main characters, what, where and why. There are many hillarious books in my book collection, and I must admit that this is not one of them! This book is funny, witty and innovative, but it's not hillarious, strange and at the frontier of madness such as the stories by Douglas Adams. In return, however, it's a lot more thrilling. I just couldn't put it down after I had started reading it! TP writes in a very complicated language, and you have to use your dictionary once in a while, but it's great practise, and soon you'll discover a broadening in your vocabulary, the only downside is that sometimes TP uses very complicated language at the punchline of a joke, causing some of the fun to go out of it.<BR>If you're just looking for a laugh I wouldn't recommend this book to you. But if you're looking for a funny and exciting tale that offers more than just a superficial \\"haha\\" this book is just what you've been looking for! Definitely a 4-star hit. ...

6304981635|5.0|Bruce Lee was an undisputed Guru in martial arts.  To see his expertise on the screen at his best is no less than a treat. This movie displays much of Bruce's talent, philosophy, and style. Produced by a hollywood producer so the quality is shown which makes the movie all the better.  An excellent story, excellent production, and the best martial arts in history. This dvd also contains a plethora of goodies including short but sweet footage of bruce working out in his backyard.  You see brandon Lee and hear his wife.  There's also an introduction with Linda Lee, bruces x-wife made for this video.  And there is a nice long production consisting mostly of Bruce's one and only broadcasted interview where the master himself gives insight into his unorthadox style and amazing philosphy.  Not to mention the (maybe lacking) documentary by the producers themselves as a commentary during the film.
B000035Z3K|4.0|While this is, by no means, my favorite vampire story, it is the one that started it all. Lugosi gives a performance that has been the standard for seventy years. The bonus Road to Dracula feature is interesting and as another bonus you get the spanish version of Dracula, which by some is considered superior to the english version. There is also an option to listen to a new musical score while watching the movie. All in all a great package.
B00000J7SS|3.0|You know what?  I've listened to this two CD set multiple times, and I ended up taking it to my local CD store for trade in credit.<br />Not that there aren't some good moments, but there aren't enough of them to justify its inclusion in my more than 200 CD collection.<br />If you like &quot;fusion&quot; I would check out the Chick Corea/Return to Forever Compact Jazz disc (available only via used, I think).<br />Miles is a wonderful guy, but that doesn't mean you have to buy this.  Besides, he's dead, so aside from his beneficiaries, who cares?
B00004TDTO|5.0|This movie has been copied, with sequels and other killer shark movies, but none can compare with this masterpiece. Ive seen this movie several times since 1975 and never tire of it. This DVD format plays wonderfully with great picture and sound quality. If you havnt seen this movie or if its been awhile since you have, perhaps its time for another look.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Spielberg has given the parent/child puzzle an epic scale, but without the preachiness of the red raincoat in Schindler. Anyone who has ever faced the mystery of individual identity and the double mystery of being the child of a parent or the parent of a child, will be more challenged than comforted by this film. <br />Everyone we know has a mommy and a daddy, biologically if not emotionally. But, what if the emotional element were to be somehow replicated without the biological? At the same time, everyone you know is going to die. What happens to the love you feel for another once you are not here anymore? <br />These are some of the issues that Spielberg evokes without explaining or preaching. At the same time he incorporates both his genius for showing the conflict of personal intensity in relationship as well as his sense of impersonal awe in the epic sense of time as the film progresses.<br />This film is a proper sequel to 2001, not in plot, but in exploration of the significance of life as we sometimes are lucky enough, in rare moments, to understand and then pursue.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Up here in Arctic Alaska it gets super-cold in the winter.  My wife and I just returned from a short outing to look for Northern Lights and narrowly escaped frostbite.<br />So when a hard-driving, down-home CD like this comes along, we play it ----and play it a lot.  The movie is also very good, but the music and the CD really shine!<br />Multiple versions of &quot;I am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; are too much---like having a superb hot fudge sundae and then being presented with another one, just as you are finished.  Ummmmm!<br />The variety, the tight instrumentals, the harmonies.....well they work well up here under the frigid Northern Lights, and I'm sure they will charge up your soul!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|At first I was taken aback by the bold imagery and seemingly out-of-place music.  However, it didn't take long to become completely captivated with Harold Zidler and the Moulin Rouge.  This movie has all the makings of a Shakesperian tragedy with a musical score that is surprisingly likeable and well-done.  Bravo to the actors for both their marvelous acting AND singing on this Oscar-worthy film, as well as to Baz Lurhmann for bringing something innovative and downright infectious.  A+!
B00005OCMR|5.0|I don't know what I can say about Tron that hasn't already been said.  The movie was SO FAR AHEAD OF IT'S TIME 20 years ago that it's staggering.  It is a landmark movie and paved the way for today's computer 3-D animation.<br />Absolutely brilliant
B00003CXSM|5.0|This movie is so good! I could watch it over and over. Jennifer Lopez does an excellent job in this movie and I really recomend that everyone see it. It has such a good story line that just pulls you right it. And &quot;no&quot; its not neccisarily a girly movie.  It is really good! I hope you enjoy it!
B00005QIPH|1.0|i cant say i didnt try...the reviews are great all over, but really man, wheres the talent?  i cant tell one song apart from another; the fuzzy chords are the same in each track.  the songs are whiny and annoying.  this is it, and it's not worth it.
B00003CXQY|5.0|I know that its &quot;just a cartoon&quot; but it was made so well. The comedy in it is great. It is one of my husbands favorite movies and we watch it all the time. Wether for a child or child at heart this is an excellent movie. I really recomend that you see it!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|For movie lovers that can enjoy music, dance, acting and put together like no one ever has. Then this is your movie. :)
B00004Z459|3.0|This is whats wrong with the mainstream music scene.  Hybrid Theory 3 songs have propelled this beyond what Limp Bizkit's Significant Other did in 1999.  Tracks that make you buy it:<BR>One Step Closer - This is when I had the most respect for the band, back in September 2000 when no one but a select few heard of them, a good song with a nice mix of hooks and aggresion.  This is phase 1, which got them good play on the rock stations and MTV2,<BR>Crawling - Phase 2, even if you hate Linkin Park you have to admit it's one of the catchiest songs i've heard in years, even though it has a very simplistic instrumental feel.  This got them major airplay on rock stations and mtv2.  Awhile later they got taste of MTV, a much later the trendy kiss fm started playing the song.<BR>In the End - One of the best executed rap/rock songs you'll listen too, a perfect blend of melody and catchiness. this song just built on the momentum of crawling and threw them over the top,  I like With You, Points of Authority, track 9, and Papercut too.<BR>But that's my problem with this album.  Sometimes when I listen too it I think it's great, other times I think it sucks.  It definitely isn't in my CD player much because the 3 best songs are all played out.  Having two vocalists is neat, but it's not that original as people think.  I also question Linkin Park's live show because a lot of samples areumm..samples, and chesters voice sounds like it's exaggerated and maybe helped out a little.<BR>Lastly, there is much better music out there than this, you just have to take the time to look.  Bands like (Hed)pe, Reviellie, and tons others have been doing what LP has been doing for years, and they don't get respect.  They tour their heads off and keep their core and true fans, so there is a connection.  They make music that appeals to the fans, which would be appaled anyway if they were seen on MTV.  While LP releases singles to fans they have no idea about, so there is no way to be connected with them fans because they are so different.  Britney Spears fans knew who Linkin Park is.  This is when a lot of their earlier LP fans, including me, kind of left.  You just get sick of hearing their stuff over and over again on the radio.  All I'm saying is while LP is good, they aren't the superhero of all bands as some think they are.  Plus this is there first CD(you can't judge a band on 1 album), so you never know what fame will do to their 2nd one
B0000028RR|5.0|This is the best Rage album ever, i am the proud owner of all 4 of RATM's released CDs, and by far, the first one is the best one. Songs like Freedom, Twonship Rebellion, Wake Up, Take the Power Back and Know Your Enemy gets to me like no other Rage song has ever. Zac Dela Rocha is a great lyricist, &quot;what? the land of the free? Who ever told you that is your enemy&quot; and &quot;rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system, i was born to rage against them.&quot; These are just a couple of examples spitted by the teller of truth. This album stirrs up emotions of anger and rage like none other, it is perhaps the greatest mix of hip hop and rock ever... Buy this album, and spread the truth!
0195145925|2.0|I found the \\"End of Time\\" extremely disappointing particularly after reading the recommendations on the back of the book. I never knew Jon Turney, John Gribbin and John Barrow to all be so wrong. This book completely lacks any discussions of what a timeless universe implies, indeed it wasn't until the notes that it was clear what the author meant by it. The \\"End of Time\\" is full of pages of argument as to why there is no time, but it's done in a very dull way for the lay reader, and, as the email printed in the notes shows, his thesis has far too many holes to convince more conventional physicists. There was absolutely nothing on what timelessness actually means, no speculation at all (which as a previous reviewer noted may be because there's nothing to predict). A highly worthy but dull book. I shan't be keeping it on my shelf
0780624890|5.0|If there is one DVD worth owning its this one.  After the Spawn movie left much to be desired, die hard comic book fans like myself awaited the release for Blade with mixed emotions, and what we got was a gem.  Wesley Snipes brings the vampire hunter Blade to life in this martial arts blood soaked action epic.  The special effects are jawdropping and the DVD picture and sound quality will leave your mouth watering in amazement.  Stephen Dorff plays villanous vampire Deacon Frost and Kris Kristofferson is great as Blade's mentor Whistler (great move getting him for this movie by the way), and ex pornstar Traci Lords stars as Deacon's vampire girlfriend.  With the release of 2000's X-Men, and the upcoming Spider-Man and Daredevil movies, the future of good comic book adapted films looks great.
0385335482|4.0|First and foremost I would like to thank my stepmother who introduced this novel to me. She shares my passion for shopping and knew that I would enjoy this book. She was precisely correct. Not only could I relate with great magnitude to Becky Bloomwood, but her character's imagination and creative and humorous comments added a hilarious degree of amusement to the story. <BR>Not only was the novel well written and an easy read, but it displayed a very strong factor that controls and shapes our youth economy of today- the urge to shop and spend money. I am a teenager- 17 to be exact- and I adore shopping. I am not as crazy as Becky, but when there is something that I see in a store I buy it- regardless of the price. This is not a very good habit, but it's also a very natural characteristic of the female nature. So people can't blame us for being such impulsive spenders. Becky's humorous outtake on shopping really opened my eyes to my many devilish and foolish shopping ways. Now, I keep my reciets and bills from every single purchase. Maybe this helps, maybe it won't, but at the end of the year I will take out these reciets to view how much money I have spent over the last 12 months. <BR>Back to the novel. This was the kind of book that you just couldn't put down because Becky had a certain way of dragging you into her life. She took things so lightly- the numerous letters from Endwitch Bank, maxing out her VISA and even hidding a pair of zebra-stripped pants from a costumer(at the store where she temporarily worked), so she could buy them herself later! A little extreme, but that is only what makes this novel all the more hilarious. <BR>I am now reading her current novel, Shopaholic takes Manhattan, and it is as fulfilling as Confessions of a Shopaholic. I love reading about Becky and her eccentric shopping adventures. Instead of reading heavy, sad novels, I like to endulge myself in relaxing, simple reads that still hit the right spot and leave me laughing out loud at how ridiculous women can be when they in their own little shopping world.<BR>Keep up the good work Sophie!<BR>-A true shopaholic fan
0897500482|5.0|This is going to be short and sweet.  Even if you hate to admit it, Bruce Lee changed the face of martial arts forever.  He brought it to the US in a BIG way and showed that it is alright to mix different styles.  Although this book is not a &quot;how to&quot;, as most people think of it as, it is an outline of Bruce Lee's thoughts and theories and opened my eyes to MANY things I did not know or think of before reading.  If you don't have it, get it.  Even if you do not practice Jeet Kune Do, it should be read by YOU!  Also recommended are &quot;Bruce Lee's Fighting Method&quot; series, which are technique-based.
B00005ABI8|5.0|I have all the Cake albums, and I think they are all wonderful. However, despite my partiality to Prolonging the Magic, I really like this album. The songs are the weirdest (with the most bizarre lyrics) out of the four albums, but the musicality can speak to anyone. I especially like &quot;Friend Is A Four-Letter Word&quot; because it's so lyrically simple, but musically complex.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Clearly every movie is not for everybody. A.I. brings me back to movies like Dune and Mad Max.  Yes,it is a long movie, but if you have a long attention span, I am sure it will be well worth it. Every scene in this movie is essential. The graphics are great and the human nature that comes through in this movie is heart breaking.<BR>So if you are open minded and fairly smart you will enjoy this movie.
B00000J8EK|4.0|Actually, the Chemical Brothers have done some stuff before that wasn't all unlike what you'll find here.  Perhaps the biggest different between this album and the ones before it is the degree of variation.  There's a lot less of it.<br />The songs vary in energy, sometimes with a good pace, othertimes being quite slow (Asleep From Day and Dream On come to mind).  But the theme is fairly consistent.  <br />Generally speaking, most of these songs are closest to Chico's Groove, Life is Sweet, Lost in the K-Hole, and Where Do I Begin?.  Rock/techno tracks like Block Rockin' Beats and Setting Sun are largely absent, although Out of Control and Let Forever Be are a little close.<br />While I didn't find any single tracks that blew me away, I enjoyed relatively most of the album (stay away from Under the Influence and Dream On, if you're trying out a few tracks).  My favorite tracks were Out of Control, Let Forever Be, and Racing the Tide (the case labels the song Surrender), but they weren't far ahead of the crowd.
B000006NPY|4.0|Most Smashing Pumpkins look down on this synth-ful album in late '90s. At that time, when I first heard this, it was very astonishing because of its difference from their privious albums. However, I did think that this was an improvement from rather pretentious \\"Melan Collie\\". If you're a die-hard metal fan, this even danceable music would not fit in your ears. However, the music itself is, when evaluated by general view, very rich and of high quality. I would give Siamese Dream a 4 and a half stars, and this a 4 stars, rather 3 stars to Melan Collie.
6302787564|4.0|Michael Douglas is splendid as William Foster who loses both his engineering job and existential place within the universe. Unemployment was not part of the tacit contract he thought existed between him and his social milieu. Hadn't he always played by the rules and conformed to the standard mores? His marriage to Beth (Barbara Hershey) has already dissolved, and this new crisis puts him over the edge.  We go along with this alienated man as he travels by foot all over the diverse cultures of Los Angeles. Foster ceases responding to the challenges and slights of everyday life in a mature manner. He instead reacts violently to even perceived insults and minor inconveniences. Needless to add, the resulting death and destruction soon captures the attention of the police. Officer Prendergast (Robert Duval) is committed to putting a stop to Foster's irascible behavior. The resulting situations are riveting and may even be found disturbing. One cannot but wonder if they might likewise flip out sometime in the future.<br />In one particularly gripping incident, Foster stops into a hardware store and converses with its ultra-right wing owner (Frederic Forrest). Our protagonist may be indulging in self pity and a sense of victimhood, but soon realizes that he is not about to partner with this hate mongering Nazi. Foster might be bitter, but he still retains the ability to say no to unambiguous evil. The last scene is profound, and should be seen by anyone who is ever tempted to think that life is unfair. Prendergast finally corners Foster and listens to the latter complain how he feels deceived by the establishment. The police man quickly dismisses Foster's excuses--and points out that most folks may have legitimate reasons to feel this way at one time or another. Nonetheless, this still does not justify going off the deep end! The makers of \\"Falling Down\\" should have been a bit more courageous. The story line had enough going for it that the excess blood shed only got in the way. This film is not quite worthy of a five star endorsement, but it definitely earns a solid four.e way. This film is not quite worthy of a five star endorsement, but it definitely earns a solid four.
0805047905|5.0|Brown Bear, Brown Bear may be my favorite all time book for young children.  The \\"rhythm\\" of the book is wonderful and the illustrations are perfect.  Children love to read it again and again.  I train child care providers and parents on developmentally appropriate practices and I always include this book in my presentations as a great, all time classic to read to and participate in with young children.  Start them out on books like this one from birth.  This book will never go out of style and you absolutely can't go wrong with it.
B00005YTFG|5.0|Come what may, I will love this movie until my dying day! Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Christian, the innocent, ardent, naive, enraptured, penniless poet is the absolute embodiment of romance.  I've never seen romantic love portrayed more truly, giddily, and heartbreakingly.  Christian is the sledgehammer of love that every romantic wants to be clobbered over the head with.  The emotional impact of this story is increased by the cumulative effect of all the songs and other movies it references. I've seen this movie eighteen times now and if I could inject it directly in a vein I would.  There's no doubt that this movie seems to be a love it or hate it experience for people.  It wasn't until the second time I saw it that it really made into a convert.  If when I was fourteen years old I had made a collage of all my favorite songs and favorite bits of movies then gone to bed and had a fever dream about them, it could have been something like \\"Moulin Rouge\\".  Only Baz Luhrmann did it better than I ever could. <BR>This movie made me remember what it was like to be young and madly in love and for that I will love \\"Moulin Rouge\\" forever.
B0000025YL|5.0|I normally dont like music this heavy,but this album is brilliant.You can argue about UDO's vocal skill all day,but from the opening track,you know this is going to be a different kind of metal.Neon Nights and Priness of the Dawn are my faves.There are no weak tracks, just some straight ahead 4-4 rockers like FlashRockinMan.I had heard bands like Venom,and liked the dark qualities,but couldnt stand the bad mixing and production.I was looking for something like them that had good songs and production -THIS WAS IT!! I first bought the Balls to the Wall album ,and then backtracked and bought them all.I was blown away by how much better this was.I think it didn't sell well because it was a couple years ahead of it's time.Their first album from 79 isnt bad, but avoid the second Im A Rebel album-it was a step in the wrong direction.they mended things in 81 with the release of Breaker-the beginnings of brilliance for this band.I just wish it had been mixed better.Seek out a used LP called The Hungry Years-it has remixes of the first four albums,including cuts from Breaker and Restless.They basically just added backward snare effects and enhanced the reverb on guitar and drums.The Breaker remixes are definitely better,but the jury is out on the RESTLESS remixes-some are improved,some are not.Nevertheless, if you're a fan of good music(Not Just Metal) Restless is an unbelievably good album.
B000002BQK|5.0|this cd is just amazing.  mariah has never given us anything less than amazing and she never will.  the greatness of her talent is just undescribable.  she will always be the ultimate diva.  go buy this album now!!!  and while your at it, buy all her other albums too.  they're just as great and you won't be disappointed!
B00003XB8K|5.0|Damn, has it been over two years? I still remember the day this album came out. Some of the songs have the Carl Orff Carmena Burana being the chord structure and it works well as 'The Gravity Of Love' proves. Unforutnately there are very few Gregorian Chants that I enjoyed on past Enigma releases. Oh well. I still find this CD to be great. In fact, despite the lack of the Gregorian chants, I find Screen to be their best CD probably since MCMXC. The Cross Of Changes and Le Moir E Mort, Vive Le Roi were almost like daytime music. This CD is a return to their darker sound although it's no MXMXC. I love all of Enigmas CD.<br />The gate has that typical Enigma intro but with a very different tone. Where the first three albums had the intro focused on the same note this album uses that intro but with a totally different feel. The gate build up with the strong ambience at the minute mark with the tingling sound effects to give a very space oriented sound. It the 1:37 mark the Carmina Burana orchestra blasts in for about 22 seconds. After it stops the voice in the background counts down and when it counts down to one the next song begins. Push The Limits is a very intense song with thundering drums at the beginning abd evolving into a hook laden song with staccato strings. Halfway through the song it wuiets down with a female whisper say &quot;Don't accept average habits, Don't submit to stupid rules, Open Your Heart and push the limits&quot;. I can relate well to that quote every now and then. The song culminates at the last minute and ends with it achoing away into the next song. Gravity Of Love was the main hit of this CD. This song is built mostly around the Carl Orff Carmena Burana sample. At the middle of the song are mournful horns that were heard in Knocking On Forbidden Doors from MCMXC. A beautiful song. Smell Of Desire is a very melancholy song that fans of Callas Went Away might enjoy. It's one of those jazzy but above average Enigma song. It's the only song that has Gregorian chants. This is a very nice song. The beat fades out with horns tieing this song into the Modern Crusaders. I,ve heard that many Enigma fans don't like this song too much so I had to defend this killer track. It's a great very edgy song that could have made a dent on the pop/rock charts. The song ends with the sound of church bells ringing in the distance tying this song into the next song Traces, Light and Weight. Traces is a very haunting song with the sound of a voice crying in the distance. It starts of with a match lighting sound effect with the church bells still ringing. Synthesizers drown away the bells. A crying voice comes with new church bells to go along with the melody.  Traces is one of the creepiest songs Enigma has ever done. It could fit on a Delerium record. I enjoy the middle part with the thundering beats and the quivering synths. The song fizzles out during the last 40 seconds and a male voice comes in with the melody getting higher towards the ending. The next song the title track, contains the drum loop from Sadeness, but the drums sound lighter and less intense. This song borrows the vocals from the Gravity Of Love. This song is my favorite off this album. The drum loop retains the same rhythm but gets lighter with the beats sounding like those from Find Love, the middle part of that 11 minute and 43 second version three track in one song off the MCMXC LP. Endless Quest has very intense drums with the pan flutes we have come to admire from al of Enigmas albums. The heavy drums stop at the 2:49 mark with lighter but much faster drums playing before they stop with the sound of a breathing deeply before Camera Obscura comes blasting in. Camera Obscura is a very intense turbulent but short track that has a fast beat and the lyrics of Modern Crusaders sung backwards. The song echoes away into the Next song. The echoing minor notes of Camera Ibscura continue with a new drum loop for about 10 seconds before a mournful major note somes in. This song is a very sad melancholy song. Cretu sings well on this song. C,mon ppl, give Mr. Cretu a break. I love this song alot. I sometimes can't stand the woman whispering because this is oneof those songs I like with little voice. It's my second favorite song off this CD despite this. The song ends with a minor note and voices chanting in the distance. Silence Must be heard starts off with echoing sound effects. Then the song becomes sort of pop-oriented not much different from the Gravity of Love. The song fades out after the 4 minute mark and the breezy melody marges with the intro horn loop and ethnic cry that becomes the closing melody that vanishes out 40 seconds later bringing this masterpiece to a fantastic close.<br />I had very high expectation for this album, but Screen far surpassed even those to become in my opinion, Enigmas strongest outing since MXMXC. This album is more medievel in sound and much darker than either Cross Of Changes or Le Roi Est Mort. It's not quite as dark as MCMXC but stormier and richer. Screen might as well be their best album so far. All of Enigmas albumks are worth owning but this should be on the top of your Enigma list and don't listen to the poor reviews critics gave this album. And get the Greatest Hits CD as well. It's over 76 minutes long and some of the songs are very different from the parent album versions. Faboulous work Cretu. I,m looking forward to Enigma 5 later this year or sometime next year.es in.

B000001DYD|5.0|I listened to this constantly during the most tumultous time of my life-[...].  In Harvey's music, I found a way to give voice to all my pent-up emotions, pointing out that if this album could be summed up in a few words, they would be 'emotionally intense.'  <br />A lot of people use words like 'raw' or 'angry' but there's a mix of highly-charged material - Harvey is romantically yearning in one moment (as in the beautiful Yuri-G), then she's striking back with the fury of a woman scorned and then becoming 'macho' in an over-the-top way (50 feet queenie/Man-Size) the next.  There's a constant tension between hard/soft, loud/quiet, the victim/the aggressor from the title track on...<br />I won't pretend this album is for everyone ('To Bring You My Love' is more user-friendly), but when you're in a certain mood, namely feeling hurt and wanting to destroy everyone in your path, then this should be in your CD player...
B00005JKEC|5.0|In all honesty, I had grown a bit tired of Denzel Washington's \\"goodie-two-shoes\\" roles in recent years, as great as they were.  His performance in TRAINING DAY, however, has given me newfound respect for him as an actor.  Not only does he play \\"the bad guy,\\" but he milks it for all its worth - his Alonzo Harris would make Clint Eastwood's DIRTY HARRY look like Barney Fife from \\"The Andy Griffith Show.\\"  The last time I walked out of a movie theater so rattled was after seeing DANTE'S PEAK in the early '90s - mainly for its special effects.  In TRAINING DAY, it was Denzel Washington's performance alone that blew me away!  The fact that he has recently received his fifth Oscar nomination - and third for Best Actor - should come as no surprise.<br />Kudos also to Ethan Hawke for a great performance and a well-deserved Supporting Actor Oscar nod this year.  Any young actor who can hang with the likes of Denzel Washington in a film like this DESERVES recognition.  Hawke proves that he has a stellar film career ahead of him.<br />The Academy Awards telecast is March 24, and my money is on both these tremendous performers to come away with well-deserved Oscar gold.  TRAINING DAY is a film with no special effects, no colorful cinematography, and no Picasso-esque art direction - just a movie that slaps you upside the hide from start to finish, with two powerhouse performances that stay with you long after the closing credits.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I've been a DT fann since '99 and to my knowledge, instrumentaly, this is their best album yet. Most people don't a preciate DT simply because to the untrained ear, it sounds like a bunch of guys playing as fast as they possibly can paying no attention whatsoever to the time signiture. But, to a musician like me, it's a work of art. Unlike previous albums such as Awake, all the sections flow together nicely. It doesn't sound real choppy or unplanned. Rudess and Portnoy are both amazing. Portnoy uses the paradigm shift fill at least twice on the album wich is kind of funny to a drummer like me. The lyrics aren't quite up to par, but considering that about 70% of the whole thing is instrumental, I can live with it. <BR>If you aren't a musician, I wouldn't recomend buying this, but if you are, than your ears are in for a treat.
0783222475|5.0|I personally thought this was a very good, exciting movie.  I liked the storyline and the movie is just spectacular.  Whoever hasn't watched this movie has missed out on great action.  Some scenes may not be appropriate for younger children, as it shows some gore and blood.  What a very sad, but satisfying movie.
0800137884|2.0|I always feel like I'm watching a documentary on life in the Hollywood Hills when I see this film. Everything about it is either way overdone (the effects, the histrionics, the makeup) or way way way underdone (Reeves &amp; Ryder performances). Ultimately this movie doesn't hold a candle to Werner Herzog's matchlessly brilliant &amp; much creepier Nosferatu (with Klaus Kinski's sublime definitive performance).
B00005QDW1|1.0|When I first heard &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; I groaned and thought that it must be the new Britney Spears single. How horrified was I to find that it was the newest release from No Doubt? The plethora of producers brought in to work on this album only serve to give the album a confused identity, and it becomes more and more obvious that this little group from Anaheim  survives off the charm of Gwen, and not on the strength of their music.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is a urban collision of lifes, presenting extraordinary facts many people has told that this movie isnt realistic at all, but I have to say that the prologue speak for itself, many of this things really happen and if you are emphatic enough you will just love this movie. 3 hours of drama, fun and mixed emotions. Tom Cruise learned how to act, everyone on this movie is great. The DVD version has a complete documentary of the making of the movie, not a usual one, every shot is on handycam and it really gets you in the production and into specific details, technical and story stuff, so if you are interested in that kind of stuff thats great. Has some secret goofs, music video of aimme (great video). BUY IT NOW!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|No...I was not born in the '50s, '60s, or '70s. I was born in the '80s, so I missed out on the time when rock 'n' roll was popular. And I missed the Beatles. The Beatles, however, happen to be my mother's favorite band, and my father loves the Beatles, too. So they have a bunch of old Beatles cassetts, CDs, and records. And so I've been able to listen to a lot of Beatles music. Much of the music on the Beatles '1' collection, is great, as far as I'm concerned. Like I said, I grew up listening to music from boybands like Backstreet Boys and New Kids On the Block, and I wasn't around the time that the Beatles were.<br />The Beatles '1' album is great for those who are just learning to like the Beatles' music, such as myself. People who have been Beatles fans for a long time may not enjoy this CD as much, because it's not the original stuff, as they'd say. But I think it was geared more toward the younger generation, anyway. My absolute favorite Beatles song ever is most definitely, &quot;Yesterday&quot;. Other Beatles songs on this CD which I find to be the best include &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot;, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot;, and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;. <br />Just to let all you older folks know that yes, we younger generation DO appreciate what the Beatles have done in music. I know lots of fellow teenagers who enjoy listening to the Beatles music, and I feel that the Beatles are an inspiration to all aspiring young artists and musicians.<br />Beatles fans who've got basically every single Beatles album, I do not recommend this one to you. But to the new fans who don't have very many Beatles albums, then the Beatles' '1' I strongly recommend. It is a collection full of classic rock 'n' roll songs that changed the way the world thought about music.
B00004TH83|5.0|i think lara fabian is the best female vocalist. I first heard her voice on her single &quot; i will love again&quot; and was blown away. It always stayed in my head. I was lucky to see her in a live concert. She has an amazing gift of music. One thing i like best about her is that she can sing with/ without the music. She has a great voice and she do not need any back up music to show that (unlike some other artists)<br />i love u...i hope u have a new video soon!
B00003CXTG|4.0|This movie was okay,but not moving.The love story was good,but not moving at all.The action was over the top,but good.That Japanese guy writing that letter to his dad made sense,but not moving like the movie's trying to tell me that he's not the bad guy.Overall a good movie.
B00003CXN4|3.0|Okay drugs are bad.  I get it.  It can affect anyone's life.  Sure why not.  What else do you have?  Not much.  This is a pretty standard storyline for a movie about crime.  I kept thinking Godfather.  Enough to make or kill a movie?  Not really.<br />What you end up with is a patchy movie.  I wanted to really enjoy it but it kept throwing me curve balls from left field that just made parts of this movie ridiculous.  Suburban mom living in La Jolla turns into a hard bargaining Don Corleone with cutting edge smuggling technology in a blink of an eye.  Trained drug policemen flippantly let a fake delivery man poison a suspect they know people are after.  A federal gov't official hangs in the ghetto to find his daughter with no (police) help.  Come on.  Give me something to work with here.<br />Okay Benicio as a Mexican drug enforcement official struggling with honor and money.  Two US drug enforcement officials struggling with a job they know is ludicrous.  Okay I like it.  Why are you constantly cutting away from these men.  They seem fairly compelling.  Why is there not more of this.  Why the rich white kids do drugs too schtick?<br />Acting is patchy too.  Zeta Jones is attrocious (and I'm Welsh too).  She's either out of her league or preoccupied with hubby during this movie.  Douglas is equally unbelievable.  He just walks through the part with no effort or attempt at pulling his character off.  Benicio, the corrupt Mexican general, the hit man are all wonderful.  Very solid stuff from these guys.<br />Maybe I can use that movie editting software on my computer to get rid of the junk.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie was very touching and sad.The love story was very sad and the attack scenes are dramatic.Everyone should see this movie because its very moving and good,and will have you crying at the end of the movie.
B00005TT77|4.0|This soundtrack is excellent, just like the film.  This soundtrack contains a load of different artists that seem to blend well together and make it worth listening to.  The standout tracks for me are, Wall Flowers, (Im Looking Through), Sheryl Crow (Mother Natures Son), Nick Cave (Let It Be) and Stereophonics (Dont Let Me Down).  Most of the other reviewers like this cd, so we all cant be wrong so i recommend that you go and buy this cd
0515125024|4.0|Another great book from the Jack Reacher series. I have read all Lee Child's books and so far have liked them all. He doesn't give away the plot so it can go in any direction, usually not where you expect. I still like the Killing Floor the best but the rest are really good too. I will continue to buy his books. If anyone needs a good read Child's the way to go.
0446677450|5.0|Life Changing Material.  Robert Kiyosaki teaches his readers to open their eyes to amazing world of investing.  As per the author, there are three folks in the world, the poor who have nothing but expenses, the rich who have nothing but assets, and there are the majority of us (In the USA) who fall into the middle class.  The middle class are the folks who think they have assets which really are liabilities.  All my life I thought that the home is one's greatest asset, how wrong I was.  Read this book and start seeing the world as a place of endless opportunity.
0425107469|5.0|&quot;Watchers&quot; was my introduction to Dean Koontz. The only reasons I picked it up were because I own an incredible Golden Retriever, and am an avid fan of suspense/horror. My worn copy has moved with me to 3 states, and I read it at least once a year. I need books that take me places and give me hope, while giving me a good &quot;jolt&quot;. This book took me on one hell of a ride...and still does! I have been reading since I could put 2 words together, and though a veracious reader, Watchers is the ONLY book I've read more than once. You will too!
B000002J09|5.0|Few albums have been praised as much as this one. Yes, classic rock stations pretty much play this whole album every day, but its not this masterpiece's fault little else comes close to it in the canon of classic rock. Don't listen to the radio myself anyway. ;) <br />The bottom line is this is a brilliant masterstroke of rock and roll which is much more than JUST rock and roll. Black Dog is a inventive and unique take on a Muddy Waters riff that stops, starts, and overpowers you. Rock and Roll, in my opinion, is the perfect rock song. If aliens landed and asked &quot;What is Rock and Roll music?&quot;, you would play them this song and all would be made clear(yes, even over the great &quot;Johnny B. Good&quot;). Yet, that was the purpose of the song. A tribute to all that is great about rock music. Still every bit as relevant.<br />The Battle Of Evermore is a beautiful folk song. The end, and the whole song, is powerful and haunting. Its songs like these that show the shear scope of the range of this amazing band. What band nowdays(or even then)could follow those two opening tracks with a song so different and make it work so well? Stairway To Heaven needs little explaining. Yes it might be overplayed, but it truely is one of the greatest songs of all-time(beyond just rock music). The next three tracks, Misty Mountain Hop, Four Sticks, and Going To California, often get overlooked and underrated even by the majority that adore this album. Misty and Sticks are two extremely original rockers. Its songs like these that set Zeppelin's brand of &quot;heavy rock&quot; apart from other formulaic and less talented bands. Like Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and the Who, they might have been one of the &quot;grandfathers&quot; that helped create &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, but they NEVER played it(as a wise man once said).<br />The last track is the brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, When the Levee Breaks. The sounds emitted from this song seems 20 years ahead of its time. Many fans and critics say this might be Zeppelin, and rock, at is most powerful and creative. Thats hard to say, its certainly a landmark song. The fact is, its yet one more indication of why Led Zeppelin towers over virtually all other rock bands then and certainly today.<br />So in closing, if you are just getting into Led Zeppelin and have yet to buy an album, or if you want to know why they are so respected, this is the album to start your collection. On a personal level, this might be the best album ever made(though its close, I have many favorites). But I would certainly rank it objectively in the top five(or at least ten)of the absolute best rock albums ever made.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Just like the title says.<br />I found this movie fascinating and absolutely incredible both as a movie and as a brief glimpse into humanity's future.  First of all, the movie by itself is incredible.  The acting is superb and the special effects are equally good.  The plot line, although a bit stretched towards the ending, is compelling and draws you right into the action, making you really feel like a part of this eerie and not-so-distant future.  And for all of you who don't want to see this just because it's another Spielberg sci-fi, don't worry - it still retains just enough of Kubrick's original influence to keep you off-balance and uneasy even after you leave the movie theater.<br />In addition, or as some people may argue at the heart of the movie, are many philosophical and moral dilemnas that make us question our everday existance and at the same time present a compelling, if disturbing, vision of the evolution of technology.  At the core of the plot is the conflict between Humans and \\"Mecha,\\" which are basically highly advanced robots.  This conflict constantly makes us call into question exactly what is human and uses emotion to blur the line between human and machine.<br />In the end, this movie feels a lot like Blade Runner meets the Matrix, minus the guns.  The special effects compliment the plot line just enough to make it deeply engrossing without overdoing it.  To be fair, however, I should warn you that this film, as with any of Kubrick's, can be an \\"acquired taste,\\" if you will.  If you go into it looking simply for action and special effects, you won't be entirely dissapointed, but you will miss out on so much of what really makes this movie great.  However, if you want a deeply engrossing film that takes the genres of sci-fi, drama, romance, and even that deeply disturbing comedy that only Kubrick can achieve, and rolls them all together in perfect unison to create an emotionally wrenching and deeply disturbing Kubrick-esque film, then this movie is definitely for you.
B00005A1PR|1.0|Short Review: After listening to this CD, I have lost faith in the Grammy Awards. I don't believe this woman was nominated for her &quot;talent,&quot; as a recording artist, but for another reason.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Someone asked themselves where they were in 1978.  I too was 18 and a senior in HS.  Pretty incredible times in rock and roll and I was fortunate to catch this tour at the music hall in Houston, TX.  That same month was the Rush 2112 tour and between the two they are probably in the top 5 of my several hundred alltime concerts. Schenker w/ the venerable Gibson flying V burned the place to the ground.  For my tastes UFO is one of those rare bands that are far better in concert than studio.  If you own no other UFO album this is the one to buy and its sounding even better with the remaster.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|...I will love this film until my dying day.  Moulin Rouge is well deserving of it's 8 Oscar nominations and it should have been nominated for at least 2 more:  Baz Lurhmann as Best Director and Ewan McGregor as Best Actor.  This beautiful film didn't direct itself and McGregor's subtly stunning performance is absolutely the heart of it.  Not that Ms Kidman doesn't deserve her accolades but like she said in her Golden Globes acceptance speech \\"Work with him.  He makes you better\\".  <br />The two make a very convincing couple and one could easily see why the naive poet would fall so quickly for a lovely courtesan and why the cynical courtesan would be won over by and fall so deeply for the young poet's earnest and passionate love.  They both look breathtakingly gorgeous(and to contradict the person who called them digitally enhanced, she's really THAT fair and Ewan's eyes are really THAT blue)  <br />The film shifts easily from tragedy to comedy and back and forth again.  Although the plot is simple, as most myths are on the surface(it is based on the Orphean myth), it reveals deep human truths and does so in a colorful, exciting way.  There is a lot of symbolism revealed in the visuals and how the scenes are set up.  Two interesting motifs are found in the way McGregor's Christian and Kidman's Satine are often framed; he looking out of his window and she gazing into her mirror.<br />The music is really used in an imaginative manner, especially on the Love Medley.   Nicole's voice is fragile and lovely and does a fine job of conveying her character's soul, while Ewan's powerful and enthusiastic voice does the same for Christian.   <br />This isn't even taking into account Jim Broadbent's portrayal of Harold Zeigler, the King of the Moulin Rouge underworld, Richard Roxburgh as the \\"evil\\" Duke or John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec, whom some might say was over-the-top but really this just increased the character's poignancy as you see how desperately he wants the kindwhich Satine and Christian have.  <br />A wonderful, unique film all around.  To paraphrase a line Christian says to Satine early in the film, what has been created is quite modern and might feel a little uncomfortable at first but if you're open, you might enjoy it.
0345440803|5.0|I find Tracy's respectful view of parenting to be refreshing and practical. Although she says there are no quick fixes, and I agree, following her method for getting my 13 month old to sleep in his crib took only 1 week. Although he is not going all night, he is now comfortable in his crib, no longer screams to be in our bed, and is no longer nursing non-stop. Yes we have our work cut out for us, but I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. I also have a 2 1/2 year old and have found her suggestions on dealing with a 'spirited' child to be right on target...again easy to read, easy to follow. I am feeling less and less like every day is a battle, enjoying motherhood the way I had hoped to. THANK YOU TRACY!!!
B000001GXC|4.0|When I first fell in love with classical music it was generally the more accessible \\"show pieces\\" like Mendelssohn's overture \\"The Hebrides\\" that stirred my soul. In fact, one of the first discs I purchased was Dutoit's recording of the incidental music from \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\" Besides the great Scherzo and the Wedding March, the disc also features three of Mendelssohn's overtures-\\"The Hebrides\\" included.  It has remained one of my favorite discs. I never thought I would a more moving version of \\"The Hebrides\\" than Dutoit's icy masterpiece.<br />I stand corrected. In this repackaged collection from Deutsche Grammophon's \\"The Originals\\" series, conductor Herbert von Karajan proves himself to be an adept interpreter of Mendelssohn's musical vision. Included are Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic's versions of \\"The Hebrides\\" overture and of Mendelssohn's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4.<br />Karajan's and Dutoit's recordings of \\"The Hebrides\\" are really as different as apples and oranges. Dutoit (with his own forces from Montreal) makes the piece into a chilling, highflying affair. Karajan's version is warmer, a little more delicate (though it does thunder at times). I find both approaches valid and pleasing. I would not want to be without either; but if forced to choose would take Karajan's.<br />Karajan gives the Scottish Symphony (No.3) a somewhat psychologically dark, romantic yet precise reading. It starts prettily enough, but there are some dark shadows in Herbert's Highlands.<br />Karajan lacks a little of the Italiante style needed for a definitive rendition of Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony (No. 4), yet this does not stop this recording from being merely great. He does let his orchestra get carried away by the Presto of the finale (as all too many recordings do). Instead, Karajan's grasp of the work as a whole is evident throughout.<br />Overall, these recording are about as good of presentation to be found of Mendelssohn's more popular works. I recommend this disc without reservation to anyone who loves music.this disc without reservation to anyone who loves music.
1558216847|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much, but questioned some of the claims.<BR>If true it is amazing, but find it hard to believe these men could always agree during this ordeal. Never did one man think to quit, stay put, or change direction?  They hadn't seen a woman for months if not years and they all looked at her as a daughter?  If fiction got the best of the writer, I would like to hear the real story.  Enjoy this book, lets hope it's the real thing.
0451450523|5.0|When I was four or five, I saw the movie, andI LOVED it! I never knew it was novel, though, until this year. I read it and it ROCKED(in lack of a better word)!!!!!!! It's about a unicorn who relizes she is the last unicorn, and she sets out to find the other unicorns! I think this is the best unicorn book ever!!!! Wait--I've only read 10 unicorn books....And anyway, this book keeps focus on UNICORNS, the real unicorn, with a lion's tail, cloven hooves, and NOT really looking like a horse!
B00005U1YO|4.0|The Chemical Brothers are coming back, and &quot;Come With Us&quot;, their fourth studio release (not counting &quot;Brothers Gonna Work it Out&quot;) is the perfect way to do it. From the resounding anthem of the opening title track to the phased-out rantings that conclude \\"The Test\\", the Chems prove once again that they are the kings of the dance floor. With the already-excellent \\"It Began in Afrika\\" and \\"Star Guitar\\" as their lead-off singles, how can you go wrong? They even try their hand at Aphex Twin-style electronica with the bizarre, yet danceable \\"My Elastic Eye\\". And the gorgeous synthesizers that kick off \\"Pioneer Skies\\" make the track a major highlight of the album. The only thing that bugs me is that the album is missing a stupendous ending. I loved \\"Dream On\\" from Surrender and I thought it was a perfect ending to a somewhat-mediocre album. \\"The Test\\" is a great track, but it just doesn't cut it as a final track. I also think that \\"The State We're In\\" would've made a good end track. Anyway, if you do decide to purchase this album, get the It Began in Afrika single as well because it's got the full-version of the track (on the album, it's shortened and it blends in with \\"Galaxy Bounce\\") and the totally awesome b-side, \\"Hot Acid Rhythm 1\\". Why that song didn't appear on &quot;Come With Us&quot; is beyond me.
B00005RDSM|4.0|Peter Pan has always been my favorite anmaited disney film I knew many people say there favorites are lady and the Tramp or The Lion King but Peter Pan has always had a special place in my heart. The limited edtion dvd release was bare bones with nothing but the trailer which is missing from this release. The new release greatly improves on the first with a great transferI mean the Godfather Trilogy was awful but this is just like the reccent Snow White and Dumbo releases. Features are good, but not up to par with Snow White i guess we will only get one release a year as comperhenisve as that one looks like it will be Beauty and The Beast in october.The features include too short features a orginal making of peter pan that is 12 minutes long that was also feautred on the vhs release four years ago another featurette that is 16  minutes and a little more informative then the first one. A sing along following the leader,a nice storybook hosted by wendy,A peter Pan interactive Treasure Hunt game and a still gallery of 63 rare storyboards, concept art and drawings.Bottom line if you love this movie as much as I do buy this version, But let's hope disney puts a two disc collectors edtion out one day it would be whorth 50 bucks to me.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is an absolutely abysmal movie.  During the early moments of the film I kept thinking surely it will break out of this intolerable and convoluted visionary and musical mess and give us intelligent film-making.  It never did.  How on earth this film has garnered any of the awards or nominations it has is beyond me.  To attempt to juxtapose turn of the century Paris with Elton John and Madonna lyrics as well as references to tunes such as The Beatles' \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and the Sweet's \\"Love is Like Oxygen\\" is utterly ridiculous.  Watching this film, or attempting to watch it (I made it only about half way through it), is an absolutely tortuous undertaking.<br />Don't waste your time on this wretched mess!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a highly entertaining film filled with music, comedy, romance, suspense and heartbreak. The movie will captivate you and you'll be singing the songs for days. I was so impressed with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor for their superb acting and singing abilites. The movie truly is the modern day musical but don't let that scare you... many of the songs are taken from well know artists and you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter. I highly encourage everyone to see this fresh and creative movie.
0451191153|4.0|The Fountainhead does a commendable job of telling a reasonably good story and showcasing Rand's Objectivist philosophy. Unfortunately, it fails in doing what Atlas Shrugged did--and that is really interest me. All the characters in the Fountainhead are nearly carbon-copies of all of Rand's characters--either emotionless egotists or maddening socialists. It's to Rand's testament that she manages to still make an interesting novel despite the lack of broader character development. The characters she does have are done well, but they're just all the same.<br />Still, The Fountainhead is a beautiful nexus between pounding out a novel-as-philosophy and making it an interesting thing to read. Atlas Shrugged also did this very well, but it had the added advantage of a wider array of character types and a streamlined plot line. Both novels drag in places when Rand shifts into soapbox mode, but this can easily be forgiven since even the dullest moments in a Rand novel are greatly multiplied in creativity than most other novels that attempt the same thing.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Nine guys, masks, and Good metal? I wouldn't believe it either if I were you but the band from Iowa uses their talent and puts out a great debut album. Corey, the lead singer, a.k.a. #9 has a great deep voice that really ties it all together. Mic (#7) uses his guitar skills to keep the beat up and the heads banging. If you are scared by their masks and hate &quot;screamer&quot; music than this isnt for you at all! However if you like bands such as slayer then Slipknot is right up your alley. I would also recomend Iowa by Slipknot.
B00005R2BG|2.0|Moulin Rouge is an experiment. Films daring at being bold, new and fresh are the most audacious since it has very much to risk, it stands on shaky ground. This movie is the proof of it. Visually interesting, funny to an extent, a mega crew, handsome actors and what seems to be, I believe miles of edited film; this movie is well crafted in terms of just that: craft. One can not say it is a bad movie, or poorly acted, because it is not; yet to believe it to be something more than an experiment and raise to Oscar level is as hallucinatory as the movie and its director.<br />On the other side, at the first ten minutes of movie, the director lets us in the story and from very short one is aware of the sequence of events and the main plot of the screenplay; making the almost next two hours unbearable to watch and provinding very little new or surprasing events in the plot. Nicole Kidman is well articulated, nice, her singing is well performed, yet very &quot;withing herself&quot;, since the writer has offered very little possibility for real acting, this film`s gendre dwells more on the cabaret-vaudeville one, so exaggeration and excess are the tone. Ewan`s singing is in bad shape. At the lower and middle tones, his voice remains much of its candor, yet at certain levels it is truly annoying: it becomes flat, dull and opaque, he must be two entire tones below the actual pitch and his voice does not blend well with that of his counter part. Thus this movie being a musical and having a bad lead is not good news. To this matter, that of music, the best scene in the movie is that of the number of Roxane. Here true intention, real acting and art are evident.<br />Pity the movie remained at being an experiment and did not trascend above shallow limitation, the director seemed too interested in making his public dizzy by so many unnecessary cuts, angles and there must have been hundreds of cuts by minute; Daz should have researched with a neurologist about the number of scenes and cuts by minute that the human brain can tolerate without reaching dangerous levels.nd cuts by minute that the human brain can tolerate without reaching dangerous levels.
B00005214X|5.0|If you loved the original &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; then don't allow yourself to second-guess the idea of purchasing this version. I held off buying this CD because I thought the original vinyl was good enough for me. I'm glad I re-thought that decision. This remastered CD is marvelous. It's even better than and will renew your love of the first album. And if you've never heard &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; then buy it. You'll quickly find out why George Harrison was far more than a Beatle to so many of us.
B00005U122|5.0|Sit back.  Relax.  Pop in this disc.  Sip on your favorite drink.  Crown Royal on the rocks and Roger Waters in the Flesh...  The ever memorable sounds of classic Pink and thought provoking lyrics from Mr. Waters make this dvd a must have for any true Pink Floyd fan.  I flipped mine on to show subtitles and sang along.  One of the greatest bands of the century.  Loved It!
B000008GEF|5.0|George Harrison's much-too-soon departure from this world caused me to replace my old vinyl with the CD version of this album, and to re-discover the wonderful music it includes. Instant crowd pleasers such as &quot;Don't Let Me Wait Too Long&quot; and &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)&quot; never get tiring; &quot;Be Here Now&quot; is charged with emotion; and &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; still stirs. But in the nearly thirty years since the album was first released, I've grown older and (let's hope) wiser, and now the more spiritual songs, &quot;The Light That Has Lighted the World,&quot; &quot;Who Can See It,&quot; and &quot;The Day The World Gets Round&quot; have taken on greater significance to me. They have become some of the favorites in my long list of most loved Harrisongs. If you, too, are older, wiser, and more spiritual, you'll find George's work on this album is a light that will light your world.
B00003W8NM|4.0|A generation raised by single women and no great depression, world war, or cause to take on. <br />No identity for men to pursue, a world of meaningless, cubicled jobs, massive consumerism, and pursuit of material gratification.<br />Fight Club touches on a lot of modern feelings the average 20 and 30-something generation of American males struggle with, and when these inner-feelings of despair and hopelessness are opened up by an underground organization by a semi-psychotic leader who attracts a nationwide organization of fighting, rebelling men who've had enough, it becomes a violent, powerful rush of meaning for the average male in modern times.<br />Erasing the debt record by which many of us are enslaved by becomes the ultimate goal and this generation's major cause, defines their identity, and makes them heroes...at least that what \\"Project Mayhem\\" attempts to do.<br />For 10 minutes in a dark, dirty basement, a man can be a gladiator again, and earn the respect of his peers in a raw, physically violent, but satisfying and rewarding act of pain and suffering that opens up their most basic and primitive human nature. Eventually this ritual leads to an organized army of rebels who have every-day, boring, dull jobs and lifestyles and let's them become someone they can be proud of and feel good about. They let everything go and ditch their creature comforts to be guerrilla terrorists bent on destroying corporate culture without murdering people, until one of their own gets killed.<br />Fight Club is a suprisingly inspirational and philosophical film with a great performance from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and a disturbing look at our society's woes and hidden circles of despair for men who are forced into being meaningless nodes in the mass consumerism of America. It's what could happen when the grown up children who once dreamed of being a rock star, doctor, lawyer, or \\"anything they want to be,\\" feel they were lied to and betrayed by the elite upper-class and1% of our society that dictates what we do ultimately under the guise of a \\"free country where you can be anything you want.\\"<br />A powerful film and one worth owning to watch again and again that says a whole hell of a lot about the travesty of our modern lifestyle. And certainly a favorite film for those who identify with the plight of those who aren't super-athletes, scholars, rich pop stars, or brought up in upper-class families where success was guaranteed, no matter how hard you work or good you may be at your dull, mindless, repetitive day job.<br />Destined to be a classic.
6300215741|4.0|There is much to like about Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at the height of their appeal, a witty script that offers Jessie Royce Landis one of the funniest roles ever seen in any Hitchcock film, and excellent cinematography designed to show off the beauties of Monte Carlo--all packaged in a lightweight tale that is two parts romance, two parts travelogue, one part comedy, and just enough classic Hitchcock suspense to keep this lighter-than-air confection from flying apart.<br />The well known story concerns a string of jewel robberies along the Riviera which lead local officials to suspect that a famous and long retired cat burglar (Grant) is once more on the prowl--but rather than hope the authorities will find the real culprit Grant elects to protect himself by unmasking the thief for himself.  In the process he encounters an icy beauty (Kelly) who takes considerable pleasure in tantalizing him with her charms, her jewels, and her knowledge of his criminal past, and her mother (Landis), who is perhaps the best of the &quot;clever matrons&quot; to appear in any Hitchcock film.  As the police close in, the three of them devise a plot to expose the thief and clear Grant, with whom Kelly has now fallen in love.<br />Unlike most Hitchcock's most famous films, TO CATCH A THIEF offers nothing dark to trouble our thoughts, and it is perhaps best regarded as a romantic fantasia, the director's vacation from his more typical material.  While it will never compete with the more famous VERTIGO and REAR WINDOW of the same period, it is extremely well done and quite a bit of fun to watch.  Viewers seeking a pleasant film with a romantic touch will enjoy it a great deal.
B000003TA4|5.0|There are some who say that Nirvana were no-talent hacks (such as their rip-offs like Puddle of Mudd or Drowning Pool), but the simple fact is that they were great songwriters.  Or Kurt was.  Sure their songs consisted of simple power chords or 3-chord songs, but a song doesn't have to be instrumentaly phenomenol in order to be good.  Nirvana came out when rock was plagued by long-winded, yet unnesesary solos that would killed the quality in the end.  It was no longer about the song itself.  Nirvana combined simple chords melodically and with intelligent lyrics that had abstractness.  And at the time that they came out to, is important.  Nirvana had simple, yet beautiful songs.  Not like Slipknot's \\"The Sickness\\".
B000002J03|5.0|The combination of great rock and blues feeling make this a great cd.  With songs like The Lemon Song, and Ramble On you can't go wrong with this collection of songs.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|When thrillers where really good? Well here you have Memento, a real jewel which will grab you and keep you on the edge of your seat. It's about a man who can't make new memories and is living the same day all over while trying to find his wife's murderer. He doesn't know who to trust because he can't remember who is friends or who isn't. The film starts at the end and takes us trough his quest for vengance all the way to the begining. At times we feel just as lost as the main character feels, and it's there that we relate to his illness. He writes on little pieces of paper, in his skin, and even  tatoos himself to keep some account of what's just happened beacuse his present only lasts a few minutes. His ilness is put to the test when a barmaid offers him a cup of beer where everyone-including himself- have put a little something.<BR>Don't miss it, run don't walk to the video store. A must see-write it on your fore head- rent Memento, rent Memento....
0790729350|3.0|The first thing to note is one of the greatest ironies of the 60's: that Sha Na Na---the favorite whipping boys of 70's bashers/60's nostalgics (for all intents and purpouses one and same), y'know, one of the villians Eddie Vedder meant to invoke in his sentinous rant \\"Against The 70's\\"---actually appeared in this festival o' peace, love 'n flowers (and, just to thrust the middle finger at all ya boomer chauavinists, did a pretty damm decent performance)! The second thing is something this commiepinko pro-feminist dude has just gotta ask: if this was supposed to be the zenith of countercultural comittment to peace, love, social justice, yaddayaddayadda---then WHERE WERE THE WOMEN? Answer---apart from Joan Baez and Janis Joplin the only women here were shown, tellingly enough in a section of side b of this 2-side DVD, AS \\"THE BODIES BEAUTIFUL.\\" As a feminist writer said shortly after Altamont: \\"Women at Woodstock, we were a service industry.\\" <br />That being said, there WERE actually SOME performances that lived up to all the \\"Woodstock Nation\\" hype. First off, there was the Joan Baez rendition of a song about labor union organizer Joe Hill (whose working-class activism most likely went over the heads of 90% of the upper middle-class WN citizens), the Who's \\"See Me, Feel Me\\" and cover of \\"Summertime Blues,\\" Arlo Guthrie's \\"Coming Into Los Angeles,\\" (only now, after having watched MIAMI VICE, do I understand what \\"keys\\" meant in his context---yup, it's about a drug---probably pot---smuggeler), Country Joe & The Fish's \\"Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die Rag,\\" a tune that has gained new realavence in George Dubya Shrub's so-called \\"war on terrorism\\" (subistiute \\"Afghanistan\\" for \\"Vietnam\\" and you'll see what I mean). Apart from that, however, the whole thing proves this---we may indeed have to get ourselves back to the garden, but (as Rapestock 99 so clearly proved) Woodstock didn't cut it.
B00005RHGK|4.0|There are many movies like this but most don't quite reach the level of Jeepers Creepers.  Nightmare On Elm Street, Silence Of The Lambs, Creature From The Black Lagoon and even Aliens are inspirations for this fine horror outing.  That's not to say that it is better than all of those.  But you'll be reminded of these and other similar good horror movies such as Pumpkinhead.  Excellent acting (Gina is a honey!), writing, special effects and visually striking overall.  I was on the edge of my seat through most of it.  Unless you are only into hardcore or if you are somewhat squeemish you'll find a lot to like.  If there are any weaknesses it can be blamed on budget limitations.  The filmmakers should be happy with the final results (the commentary supports that).  Very spooky.  Love the unpredictable ending (commentary mentions some viewers disappointment with the ending...not me).  Most moviemakers would have ended it differently.  I'm really hoping for Jeepers Creepers 2.  There are some ideas that are not fully explored; again, because of budget constaints.  I'd like a bit more humor (like Nightmare on Elm Street) but it was a smart move to keep the Creeper demon silent and mostly humorless.  Freddie he ain't.  And that's a good thing.  Another strength is the main characters are brother-sister and not boyfriend-girlfriend.  Watch and you'll discover way this works so well.  What I don't understand is why this isn't done more.<br />I rented mine but will probably buy it here when the price drops (perfect for my month long October horror movie marathon).  The DVD picture and sound are both excellent.  It's a doublesided disc with movie on one side and lots of extras on the other.  It has a nice selection of deleted scenes.  Dig that alternate ending!  Not to give anything away, but in that final shot I would've liked to see him perched instead of sitting on a stool.  It begs the question Is He A Demon Or Something From This World?  He looks a little too much like Freddie Kruger at times.  But with that axe he has a reaper-thing going.  To give credit where credit is due, there is a terrific scene near the end against a window that really establishes this as a demon removed from the others.  I'll just say \\"face wings\\".  Also, the commentary mentions that it \\"steals clothes from it's victoms over the years\\".  Very eery stuff.  Don't pass over the documentary (done just for the dvd) it's very good; showing all the production steps.  Future movie makers should use this as a reference.<br />Favorite scene:  Creeper on top of the patrol car.<br />Favorite line:  \\"What have you brought to my house?\\"reddie Kruger at times.

B000003TAW|5.0|The Blue Album by Weezer is straight up a solid &quot;5&quot; album.  I dont understand how that &quot;music fan from new york&quot; or whatever his name is thinks otherwise.  The green album bows WAY down to the blue album and is by far their best work.  Everyone and Anyone who is a rock fan must add this record to their collection.  No questions asked this album is solid from front to back.  No &quot;b-side album&quot; as he put it can sound like this.
B00003CXXS|4.0|I have to admit I was worried going into this trilogy-making event.  I knew Speilberg was no longer at the helm.  And, well, we all remember Jaws 2, 3 and 4.  But luckily, in this 3rd outing, Jurassic Park is still a picnic thanks to the competent direction Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk The Kids and Jumanji).  Many of the crew from the first 2 films return.  And there's some good star power thrown in with William Macy, Tea Leoni and Michael Jeter; also, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are back.  It must be said that the new dinos are delectable!  There are still the scene-stealing special effects.  Some of these moments are jaw droppingly gorgeous.  A battle scene near the beginning goes on my list of favorite movie moments.  We've come a long way since those battle scenes in the 1930s King Kong.<br />There's also some wonderful dino-facts used in the film so pay close attention.  The smartness of the Raptors is quite interesting.  As for the characterizations,  I'd change Leoni's character to be more emotional about poor old Ben.  At least greave a little before going to the next situation.  In fact, modern movies tend to give all the characters the attention span of your average 5 year old.  How else could you stand there joking around when only a short time before a member of your party was torn apart by a razor-toothed lizard.  But...it's a movie!  It's fun!<br />I rented J3 but will buy it here when I want to see it again.  All three of these will be on my DVD shelf.  The DVD has terrific images and sound on my player (pc computer with GeForce 2 card and WinDVD).  Lots of extra stuff to check out - good for many hours of fun overall.  I'd think the extras make this a must purchase for fans of the series.  A solid 4 stars overall.

B000002MUW|4.0|While its not the most essential Madonna album, Bedtime Stories is a nice breath of fresh air. Following the overhyped and dissapointing Erotica, Bedtime Stories is set on a new pair of sheets and a mint on the pilow. The album contains a handful of sweet dreams; like the smooth and sultry \\"Secret\\" and \\"Take A Bow\\" is probably the best ballad since 1993's \\"Rain\\". Madonna has always been a dance artist though, and on this particular album she supplies some of the electronic beats that will lead to \\"Ray Of Light\\". \\"Holiday\\" was really where it all started, and the Bjork/Nellee Hooper produced \\"Bedtime Story\\" shows Madonna has not become a contemporary artist. For those snots who have snubbed their noses at Madonna for all the SEX hoopla, she gives them the finger on \\"Human Nature\\" with an infectious r&b groove and a potty mouth. \\"OOPs.. I didnt know i couldnt talk about sex..\\" she sarcastically spits. MEOOWW! Check the video if you think shes softened at all. As for the duds, theres good and plenty unfortunately. The opener \\"Survival\\" would be the first to get voted off the island, \\"Id Rather Be Your Lover\\" is the result of way too many late nights for Madonna. Id Rather her have trashed this. \\"Dont Stop\\" is too bad, even for the Erotica album. So in this new age of Madonna, where shes moved on to bigger and better things like motherhood, big belt buckles, and using violence as a new controversy tool; we can safely say Bedtime Stories was the best of times, and the worst of times, but definitely better than Erotica.

My personal favorite is &quot;Track Eight: Mr. Longbottom Flies.&quot; Williams hit Neville's character right on the nose with the clumsy, confused notes that make this song a must- listen- to! Neville is my favorite character, and he shines in this track.

The first was a required text in high school, and the second (A Time To Kill) a required text for college.  Though I was required to read this I found it to be very enjoyable.  With the end of each page, I  wanted to continue reading and was disappointed when I reached the end.  Please don't watch the movie until you have read the book.  The movie does not do this story justice.  I look forward to continuing my new desire with Mr Grisham's next book!

B00005QIPH|5.0|After reading some of the reviews that trashed this album saying it's a rip off of the band's rock and roll predecessors, I thought I should help neutralize some of the jealousy I'm hearing. The only people who don't like this album are those who resent the fact that The Strokes hit it big and fast, with a little help from they're family along the way. I don't listen to music because a band has payed their dues. I listen for one reason: enjoyment. And I have to say The Strokes debut album is brilliant from start to finish. Go buy it. In a music industry dominated by either computer derived sounds and modern hard rock one-hit-wonders, \\"Is This It\\" is a breath of fresh air. The album is beautiful in its simplicity, weaving muffled vocals and lively guitar riffs to create a unique rock and roll sound.

B0000024JN|5.0|Not counting It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, this is the greatest rap album of all time. There's some wisdom here. (See my title.) But what makes it truly great are the rhythms (&quot;Paul Revere&quot;), and the spirit. If you want to know more, click where it says BUY.

0783246641|4.0|This adaptation of the gritty bestseller is a real find.  In it we have Christian Bale as `psycho' of the title Patrick Bateman, spurred into action through a boring 80's lifestyle of business and appearances.  By focusing on middle-class society's little nuances, this movie manages to show just how complacent society has become, with Bale's lifestyle of a perfectly astute businessman masking his other life as a murderer who hires prostitutes up to his trendy flat.<br />The performances are all good but it is Bale who impresses the most as he calmly murders a colleague yet becomes pent-up with rage when someone has a more expensive-looking business card than his own.  The audience sits back and watches as the beautiful ensemble cast (including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon and Jared Leto) are lured or skewered by Bateman.  This is black comedy at its very blackest, forcing its audience into nervous titters as Bateman moonwalks behind one of his victims, wielding an axe, or prepares for a murder whilst listening to Whitney Houston.<br />It's not only a darkly humorous piece but it also says a lot about society today, despite being set two decades ago.  Moreover it's a definite improvement on the book, toning down the violence to make it a lot more comic and a little less horrific but not to the extent that the message doesn't come across loud and clear.
B000059PR3|3.0|If you like your horror flicks with a certain level of well-done special effects gore but aren't terribly concerned about whether the story hangs together well, then this is a film for you.<br />One part haunted house movie, one part slasher flick, and with a dash of mad science thrown in out of left field for good measure, &quot;The House by the Cemetary&quot; exhibits all the strength and weaknesses that were the hallmarks of Italian horror movie makers in the Seventies and Eighties; the gore is appropriately disgusting--although the highmark in this film is definately the maggot-infested insides of the film's monster!--but there are characters who behave inconsistently or incomprehsibly and the script writers seem more concerned with getting from plot contrievance to plot contrievance, or providing excuses for the special efffects crew to go to work than they are with providing a story that hands together sensibly by the time the End Credits roll.<br />The basic storyline involves a researcher who moves with his family to Boston to complete the work started by a collegue who committed suicide. Through a flurry of coincidences (or Fate, or maybe the researcher's specific manipulation, take your pick), they end up in a creepy house that is tied to the subject of the research. Ghosts, unkillable bats, and weird murders then drive the young family toward doom.<br />If you go into watching this movie knowing what to expect, you'll find the time well spent. While I am frustrated with the unclear reasons for the behavior of the creepy babysitter and other continuity and story elements that strike false notes even if you're not thinking too hard while watching, it's nothing worse than what is to be expected in a movie from this vintage and &quot;vinyard.&quot;
0879306033|3.0|This is a book with good timing.  The interest in older synthesizers is at an all time high.  Synthesizers that used to sell for $50 can go for a few hundred thanks to the revival in that analog synthesizer.  So this book is a great resource for those with more than a passing glance in older synthesizers.  <br />The piece written by Bob Moog is the highlight of the book and well worth the price.  The book as some great colour photos and a lot of B&W photos.  Strangely the book is almost barren of any good information on synthesizers made in Japan.  Korg, Yamaha and Roland are almost totally ignored with a few Spartan paragraphs.  Considering this book has and entire chapter on Keith Emerson custom Moog (it had a fake TV in it ha ha) you would think it would have space for more information about Japanese made synthesizers.  European synthesizers are given slightly more coverage but only one chapter.  <br />The rest of the book is basically information on US based synth makers.  While US synth makers were important I am not sure they warranted the real estate they got in the book.  I think some of that space could have been spent on the rest of the world.  <br />A rather large section on keyboards that were never made but it's not as interesting as it sounds.  The book rounds off with a massive selection on non-synth keyboards is included.  I think some people may find this interesting but I am a fan of synthesizers so I found it more than a little boring.<br />This is a great book but it's not all it could be.  If your a fan of music or just the gear, you should pick it up.  Just skip the boring parts.

B000002UYZ|5.0|An amazing greatest hits collection from the amazing, influental band. All the essential Beatles hits are here, in order, perfect for new fan listening. This spans from the early stages in their career (puppy-love sap thats sweeter than any Backstreet Boy song):&quot;From Me To You&quot;, &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;; to the more progressive, evolving experimentation: &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. While hardcore fans who cant get enough of the catalog may want songs that werent necessarily hits but stellar just the same; like &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; and &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot;, theyll just have to buy the individual albums. This is good enough, and so is the blue greatest hits record. Go Beatles!
0571202284|3.0|Apart from the momentary dream sequences of commentary by various well known industry animators, this book is only a duplicate of Preston Blair's book. In fact it is cheaper to buy Blair's book if you are really interested in learning about animation. This book is more notes on animation rather than a survival kit. If you can afford to have only one book, then Blair would be the better. This comes in as second place. I think Williams would have been better off writing an autobiography than doing this book.
B00005NWM3|3.0|well, the CD is OK i guess, but I sometimes wonder if the whole CD is the same song...i was listening to it just this morning and i was like &quot;has the song changed?&quot; and it was on song number7....so its basicly all the same thing...but its OK i guess...i like How you remind me....thats why i bought the CD in the first place, &quot;how u remind me&quot; is the best song on here. this isnt very helpful is it?
0446525537|5.0|As a child of the age of thirteen I must say that this is one of the best books I've ever read. It's diffrent than any other. Sad and joyful at the same time, you don't find this very often. This can be enjoyed by people of all ages especailly teenagers. I personally loved this book and found myself crying, and then found myself laughing. The book was so good that I'd stay up all night to read it. I do agree with the critics, this is one of Nicholas Sparks greatest works.
B000006TRV|5.0|It's ironic that Pink Floyd's ominous double concept album \\"The Wall\\" was released at a time when, to quote drummer Nick Mason, \\"There was no friendship within the four members.\\" And as Mark Fisher (stage designer for the extravagant live performances of \\"The Wall\\") pointed out, \\"There was this metaphor for the problems in life that arise due to noncommunication being executed by a band that was absolutely failing to communicate [amongst themselves].\\"<br />But nonetheless, the album is relatively flawless. No artist has done anything quite like it since. Its power, its strength, its gloomy atmosphere all remain one of Pink Floyd's lasting trademarks, and one of the biggest selling albums ever (currently in the top forty highest sellers of all time).<br />Pink Floyd--always hailed as the perfectors of the concept album--present their most complex story to date; \\"The Wall\\" is the story of a pop singer, \\"And there it ends,\\" says Bob Geldof, who portrayed the character in the film version (the fact that it was turned into a film alone should tell you how phenomenal the record was). Tracing his emotionally damaged life, the album builds the character without missing a detail, although sometimes speeding through things; shortly before the character is born, his father is killed in action in World War II ('Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1'. This is based on a true event that happened to Pink Floyd's principle songwriter Roger Waters). A related 'brick' is the war that left his homeland scarred ('Goodbye Blue Sky'). From there, he is faced with an overprotective mother ('Mother') and a harsh, faceless, cruel life at school ('The Happiest Days of Our Lives', 'Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2'). After growing up, the character becomes a rock star, a desperate attempt at escaping the pain of his childhood. He also gets married, unfortunately to the woman who scars him even further by cheating on him ('One of My Turns', 'Don't Leave Me Now'). Finally, the last few bricks to his metaphorical wall of emotions are added, and he closes himself from the rest of the world ('Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3', 'Goodbye Cruel World').<br />The second half of the album partly depicts the character in his hotel room, dwelling on his painful past, and unhappy position as a rock star ('Is There Anybody Out There?', 'Nobody Home'). One of the strongest studies of the character is 'Comfortably Numb,' which shows how all of the pain he has endured, added with a drug addiction, has transformed him into an emotionless being. Further expressing this are 'In the Flesh', and 'Waiting For the Worms' which depict how his rock star life and dominating peers have turned him into a fascist, yet still causing him to fear for his life.<br />Undoubtedly the most powerful piece in \\"The Wall\\" is 'The Trial,' which fantastically depicts the character's decision to 'tear down the wall' and face his past, his present, and his future.<br />All of these things form a metaphorical 'brick' in a wall that the character used to fence himself from his feelings, and from the rest of the world. Although \\"The Wall\\" is mostly the work of Roger Waters, every contribution from each member of Pink Floyd is key to the album's power--though their contributions were limited; keyboardist Rick Wright was forced out of the band by Waters during the album's production, and drummer Nick Mason was even replaced entirely on one track. And though the tension that surrounded the band at that time is evident, it somehow adds to the gloomy atmosphere of \\"The Wall\\", almost strengthening the entire album. Truly ironic. Every piece of the album is necessary in order to tell the story--even the seemingly diminutive and forgettable pieces like 'Vera' or 'Bring the Boys Back Home.' To use a shopworn cliche`, \\"The Wall\\" is a masterpiece that was truly ahead of its time. It has yet to be matched, much less topped in quality.metaphorical wall of emotions are added, and he closes himself from the rest of the world ('Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3', 'Goodbye Cruel World'). <BR>The second half of the album partly depicts the character in his hotel room, dwelling on his painful past, and unhappy position as a rock star ('Is There Anybody Out There?', 'Nobody Home').

B000002UAR|5.0|I'm 15 at the time of this release and I am a apperentice studio set-up A&amp;R in the very happening Studio Scene in the heart of Hollyweird, I probably apperciate the creative blending/labor involved here,more than most,considering our equipment and deck technology was quite a few steps ahead of theirs! In my mind this work was an experimental collage/musical bridge designed to meld their past,present, and future talents, much like a dreamscape, allowing us to fully groove in the sureal musical landscape, so aptly generated thru their rareified atmoshperes, accentuated also Sir George Martin, who at the time is their 'headmaster@abbeyroad' musical university!!Amazein'times...
B00003CX5P|3.0|The movie was alright, but had Inconsistencies. Like Needing to do a blood test to see if they had the Force in them ? Darth Vader could feel Obi Wan when he was on the Death Star. And Jar-JAR What a Joke !!! The putz was on the show 85 minutes longer than he needed to be. If he is in the next chapter, It is because he needs to suffer a brutal Death for everyone to see for dealing with that idot in the Phantom Menance.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I was originally introduced to this movie during its initial release in '88 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I purchased the VHS version (and soundtrack on LP) as soon as it was available.  The DVD version allows for the wonderful cinematography and editing to be further enjoyed.  There is certainly a lesbian subtext that is often overlooked.  It reads as a slightly different movie within that context.  It makes it all that more wonderful.  <br />(Check out Zuckerbaby, Salmonberries and Rosalie Goes Shopping also my Percy Adlon)
0440224764|4.0|It starts at with a man being chased and caught by sleazy and mysterious kidnappers.  It turns out this man ripped off his law firm of millions.  Caught by his company and the US government, he works with a woman to keep his fortune and stay out of jail.<br />Grisham spins a good tale.  It starts out as a great adventure, then turns into a superb mystery, then through intrigue, subterfuge and a slow unraveling of the mystery, a law book emerges.  Grisham, a great storyteller, doesn't let down in this book.  The plot moves quickly and grabs the reader.  A true page-turner.<br />Any fan of Grisham, or good stories in general, should pick this up.
B00005M91K|5.0|Although essentializing in its understanding of nature, its anthropomorphism (perhaps anthropocentric at times) and in its assumption that nature can be somehow unmediated, Baraka provides a global view that can be very important in the context of the somewhat myopic view of the West.  Even with these epistemological and metaphysical (ontological and cosmological) concerns, it is a movie worth owning and enjoying.  Those who wish to romanticize, will do so, but it is also possible to view this movie through a deconstructive lens and enjoy it that much more
044022165X|4.0|A young man, struggling through college with a job and classes and the upcoming bar, finds out his future job is gone.  He's in debt because his girlfriend dumped him right after buying her expensive jewelry, while facing the one of the worst Lawyer job markets around, and he just got evicted.  This no luck kid finds the case of a lifetime.<br />Grisham expertly weaves a story about this young lawyer during a crucial time of his life.  Through chance, he joins up with a sleazy law firm, finds and rescues a helpless girl, and takes on a large corporation.  It's a touching story that really makes you root for the main character.  The book is easy and fun read, and like any Grisham novel, the pages fly by. <br />The book is not perfect however.  The ending is predictable and corny, and the hard luck story gets old after a while.  <br />I suggest this book to anyone that wants a good read.  I would not recommend the movie though, as it doesn't capture any of the essence.
B00004Z311|5.0|I was waiting for years to see this Defenitive Edition in the Internet. And it's pretty cool! Jup! Now we'll get the entire movie-stuff including the Masterpiece-Score by Jerry Goldsmith (with the  fantastic \\"Fairy Dance\\") and all the scenes, that did not make the final cut (By the way...WHY???). But hurry up a bit in releasing this. This could be the Chance to eliminate all the faults, that were done on this movie from the beginning. That could bring us a non-expected milestone in Fantsy-Genre. It sounds good and sure will be. So don't waste time...release it now! And an European Release in RC-2 must follow...IT MUST!
0440234743|3.0|A rich old man concocts a plan to remove his family from his will in the most curious way.  What's left is a hectic aftermath where the family is suing, and the search for the missing sole heir takes a recovering alcoholic to the depths of the Amazon rainforest.  A nice location piece, with action, vivid descriptions, and the usual mixture of Grisham law, is a good read.<br />Grisham mixes in his great mix of characters, a great description of the Amazon and a removed Native American Brazilian tribe, and the intricacies of inheritance laws.  While the plot moves quickly, there's not much to capture the attention.  The reader shares no sympathies with any of the characters, and some characters are too one sided.   At some points, the descriptions get a little dull and overwhelming, especially concerning the family and their lawyers.  <br />I'd like this book, but somehow it was unsatisfying.  It's got the classic Grisham story telling substance, but it's too long for such a simple plot.
B00005RDSM|5.0|I purchased the Special Edition the day after it was released. The film essentially looks the same as it always has, except that the backgrounds are clearer.  There must be something about digital revitilization of movies that just makes the background stand out more!  In addition to this, the soundtrack has improved--quite noticeably.<br />As for the Bonus Features--they're very well done and worth viewing! The Making of Peter Pan was very informative and colorful...lots of pictures and sketches from production in the late 40s-1953.  <br />Captain Hook is as clever as always...Peter Pan a great character.  Does anyone else wonder why his ears are pointed though?  Hmm...and Tinker Bell sparkles.  What a pixie!  As a whole, great entertainment and an improvement from my 1990 VHS (when it was first released onto video!!) and even from the DVD version released just about 3 years ago.  I'm just so happy to have this movie on DVD now as it is one of my favorites...Hurray for Captain Pan!
0451196716|4.0|This was a great book, for me, anyway. It was a page turner (as some may call it) because the first day I got it I read it for five hours (three in the morning and two at night) and the next day I read it for another two hours and finally finished. It was so exciting even though the idea was kind of silly that these mindless, emotionless soldiers would blow 14-16 year old kids' brains out. There was quite a few gory scenes in it. My favorite part was that King got into the characters so well, you either hated them or liked them. But the main characters Ray, Pete, Art, Stebbins and so on (there were so many characters) were so real. I actually missed and felt bad for them when they died. Even some of the characters some people might hate, like Barkovitch and Olson and Parker, I still liked them, in a way. Anyway this is a good book and I recommend you read it and pass it on to a friend. Although i thought it was good, some people won't like it.
6304077955|3.0|This film is worthwhile if you enjoy intelligent, thought-provoking films with good character development.  While action is basically non-existant in this film, the dialogue is second to none.  The film almost seems like a modern rendition of the life of Socrates, as it follows a young homeless philosopher through London as he comes in and out of the lives of several people for the supposed purpose of gaining a better understanding of life.  The movie is very philosophical in nature and deals with the notion of self-fulfilling prophecies and what most closely resembles extistentialism.  I gave it only three stars because the film definitely has its downfalls.  Most of the philosophies of Johnny can be found in \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"A Better Place\\", just to name a couple.  In other words, not the most original system of thought.  The biggest problem with the film is the astounding level of ambiguity.  It is unclear how Johnny ties in to the minor character Sebastian whose lives end up somewhat intertwining.  It is also unclear what the constant rape and abuse of women on the part of the men in the film is supposed to represent.  Chances are that you'll finish the film and ask yourself \\"What's the point?\\"  This would not be uncalled for as the film seems to have no definitive message or theme.  Despite the fallbacks, the film is still worth watching because if you do find meaning in the film, it will probably be the conclusion, as it seems to show that despite his detachment from society, Johnny is nevertheless human and therefore incapable of overriding his basic human instinct of survival.
B00000K0YC|5.0|This is really just an aside to the fine reviews already here, but I wanted to mention that this is probably the best-sounding Compact Disc in my jazz collection. It's always been an excellent recording for sound quality (I've owned this in a number of forms over the years), but this Fantasy 20-bit re-release tops every other version I know about. It's really extremely satisfying from a sound-quality perspective. If you want to see all of Fantasy's 20-bit remasterings, go to fantasyjazz.com, click on &quot;New Releases,&quot; and scroll to the bottom of the page (they don't make it very easy to find--I sometimes even forget from one visit to the next where the heck the list is &lt;s&gt;). The whole series is of a remarkably high standard both musically and sonically. Another great one is Gene Ammons' &quot;Boss Tenor,&quot; and Kenny Dorham's &quot;Quiet Kenny,&quot; and....
B00003CWTI|5.0|The Magnolia DVD is a perfect reminder of why this format is incredibly better than VHS. Seeing this film on VHS and DVD, the difference is immeasurable. The image is a million times sharper, the sound is crisper, and the wide screen expansion adds a depth and fluidity to the images that this film needs to effectively tell its story (a need that might not exist with most films, but is a necessity with Magnolia). One of the many strokes of genius of Magnolia is PTA's command of the camera, and when the images are at its optimum quality, the story flows better and one can appreciate aspects of the film that were lost on VHS. For instance, the texture and sound of the frogs as they hit the windshields, and the POV shot of the frog as it falls down from the sky into Jimmy Gator's window warrants a new appreciation for this film, as one can realize how truly innovative PTA's visual expertise is. Apart from the visual enhancement, the second disc comes loaded with special features ranging from hilarious outtakes (in the color bars section), the Frank Mackey infomercial, a deleted section of the Frank Mackey seminar (which by itself could be a brilliant short film), about 6 different trailers, and a making-of documentary by Mark Rance, which covers EVERYTHING about Magnolia (it's actually maybe too long) from pre-production to shooting, post production, the premiere, the Berlin festival, and the animated PTA goofing off with his always compelling girlfriend, Fiona Apple. Magnolia is a great DVD, fans of the film in its theatical or VHS format, will love this, and people like myself who saw it and had mixed feelings about it will be hooked. I love Magnolia!
0446608955|2.0|Honestly, in contrast to the world of incredible books out there, nicholas spark's writing style is just plain childish. I mean, theres nothing wrong with telling a good old fashioned story, but you know there's something wrong when you can start predicting how he is going to deliver his next sentence, and I even came up with his formula (and the entire book repeats itself like this): 1. a sentence or two about the facts of the current situation, 2. Some 'humurous' comment about the subject that was discussed in #1. Well, okay, lets suppose we don't even care about that- it made almost no sense whenever he would follow Jamie around, walking her home, etc... And then try to admit that he didn't like her at all, right up until they really start showing their \\"true?\\" emotions towards each other. This argument is really coming not from a literary point of view, but just a plain-old-common-sense kind of view about human interaction, and what is natural. In other words, I am not criticizing his character creations, but rather, their interactions and reactions. I think Jamie Sullivan is an incredibly concocted character, and there is was so much depth in her, but Nicholas Sparks only cared to hint at what really made her tick. We never really had anything in-depth, and I think her character, really, really deserved that kind of in-depth literary treatment.     This book should appeal to a very broad range of tastes, from the overtly-intellectual types seeking a calmer, more slower writing style, to young girls. But, after finishing, I felt something inside of me that wanted to re-write his novel, I really feel that he had a lot of good initial ideas; although he did properly work-through his ideas about this young romance, he never really quite \\"hit-the-moon-and-stars\\". I do find the book reasonably priced in its paperback format, and I do not want to dissuade anyone who was interested in purchasing it, I am just giving warning that you may feel at the end, that the storywasn't carved out enough, and didn't really have any sort of power.     I think the real reason why most people find the book appealing, is in the power of the character he gave to Jamie Sullivan. Again, its a little unfortunate there was not enough material on her to really take this book higher. Nicholas Sparks works on the notions that hints can be stronger than all-out-balls-to-the-wall descriptive/introspective prose, which can often be the case, but there just wasn't enough material to really find this to be satisfying. Perhaps I am expecting a book to really transform ones-self through the sharing of experiences - why should I or you settle for less?
B00002MZ4W|5.0|What is music? And further, what is good music?<BR>I ask myself this question quite a bit nowadays in the midst of boneheaded noise- all of which are currently posing as music these days, and what's even more offensive, as popular music.  It's important to recognize what constitutes as music and to what degree of quality because it is very easy to become jaded and distraught by an art form- pop music that is currently failing and essentially cheating a contemporary culture once so devoted to it. Fiona Apple unlike MTV, does not bite the hand that feeds it.  She treats listeners like the highest order of people. It's ultimately that respect for the listener's intelligence that makes When the Pawn so endearing. It sincerely sounds like she is trying to make a really good album, no strings attached, that she succeeds is even more encouraging.  although there probably is a Fiona package- the stories of bullying and childhood torment, the physical beauty, and most critically the fact that many people dislike her (for no apparent reason pertaining to her music) so liking her makes the listener feel special, but utimately, the package is completely natural and Apple is not a victim of the Music Factory which springs out new sensations by enlisting them with certain characteristics that appeal to a particular pop climate (Alicia Keys are you listening.) Apple is of her own creation- flaws and all. It's this willingness and honesty about her less attractive qualities that make her MORE attractive- as an artist and a celebrity of interest. But back to the original question. What is music and what is good music? Well, needless to say I would put Apple in both categories. It is music because it contains REAL instrumentation- complex piano playing, unglossed singing. There are hardly any techno effects or ridiculous keyboard junk. It is a girl playing a piano and singing and thanks to producer Jon Brion, with string arrangements and heavy-duty bass and drums adding texture. Somepeople might label it art-pop because of the complexity, but I think that this is jaded thinking. Compared with Enrique Iglesias, sure it's art pop. But compared with that of years past, WTP is purely pop, a bit challenging, but nothing overly abstract. Another thing that sets WTP apart from most albums is that it is deep and high-reaching in its lyrical content. It does that thing that is rarely done nowadays- it is poetic, which means that it expresses a specific thought with metaphors and imagery, so sometimes it takes a few minutes of rereading it to grasp the meaning- and even then there's more. Everything about this CD has layers- which in of itself constitutes as good music, -even Fiona Apple's voice has layers, many of them filled with contradictions- high notes and low notes, beauty and scariness, independence and submissiveness. This all makes for some great music, but what makes it exceptional, the cream of the crop, THE premiere album to buy is simply because it hits an emotional nerve. Plain and simple. Many great albums had it right up till' there- great musicianship, thoughtful lyrics, but then stopped before an emotional reaction could take place. But not too many can make you cry and laugh and dream about a better place because of 10 songs, and that is the very purpose if not definition of music in the first place.
B00003CXAA|5.0|My mom bought me this DVD collection for my birthday in January,I have never been so happy to receive a gift.  I ripped it open right then to see what sort of bonus material was offered.  This collection is awesome in so many ways, not only is the picture clear and the sound superb, you get to see the making of The Godfather III and lots of cool commentary from Francis Ford Coppola.  Also, the bonus disc has screen tests and stuff, I had no idea that the studio did not want Al Pacino to play Michael.  I cannot imagine anyone else in the role.  Martin Sheen actually screen tested for the part, which I found to be humerus.  Either way you go, this collection will be well worth your money.
0446608955|2.0|It's Love Story all over again, only more poorly written.  &quot;First you will smile and then you will cry,&quot; says the narrator.  And, consummate literary manipulator that Sparks is, I did cry.  It felt good (that's why he gets two stars).<br />  The movie's out and I expect it will be enormously successful.  I see it, though, as a setup for a more-trendy sequel in which Sparks' writing talent be better used:  the 57-year-old Baby Boomer protagonist who's been carrying a torch all those years finally meets someone -- the woman from the story -- and finds a way of participating fully in the now.  Another three-tissue tale.<br />  BTW (and perhaps a propos of nothing) -- did anyone else notice that Sparks' protagonist is almost exactly the same age as his late parents (Landon Carter is 57 in 1999, therefor born in 1943; his parents were born in 1942.)  There are more angels here than meet the eye.<br />  In summary:  Would I buy it again? NO.  Would I read it if I had it to to over:  NO.  Will I see the movie?  NO.  Will I read/see the probable sequel:  NO.  But if you come across a copy of this book at little or no cost, and have some unshed tears to release, you can count on this book to do the job.

0743201140|1.0|Cute, in other words, but not worth the paper it's printed on in terms of being a useful resource for people wanting to change their lives.  The authors obviously show a remarkable strength in the area of making money, if you decide to buy this book.  (By the way, if you get it used, odds are the CD-Rom and its mysterious # won't work for you.)
6302732875|5.0|Glengarry Glen Ross is a flawless film adaptation of Mamet's pulitzer winning play. The characters in this film are drawn with a lightning bolt, each one his own man. Ed Harris and Jack Lemmon are absolutely riveting. Much has been said about Lemmon's performance and it seems like Harris's Moss is often overlooked. These are my two favorite actors and if you watch the subtle expressions on Ed Harris's face as he gets screamed at by Alec Baldwin you'll know what I mean. Lemmon is pathetic as the \\"machine\\" in a performance that deserved more recognition as well. I hate to single out these two in such a wonderful cast but they're just too good. Pacino gives a flashier performance which was good, maybe too flashy in some areas. The other actors, Arkin, Spacey, Price, deliver but aren't in the same league as the above three. I find myself talking about performances but it's difficult not to when the writing and acting are this superb. Watch this movie. It is truely one of the great films of the past decade.
B00003CX97|5.0|DVD technology on this edition makes the clarity of image as good as it originally was in the theaters.<br />What with George Orwell loose about the shop during the century's early years, and the head-cases of Fourteenth Army  roaring about the jungle during the war, it is perhaps little wonder why modern day Myanmar has so many problems.  As Sessue Hayakawa's camp commandant shows, Englishmen can drive Asians crazy.<br />As lovingly described in George MacDonald Fraser's wartime memoir, Quartered Safe Out Here, Fourteenth Army seems to have been a haven for lunatic British officers and other ranks willing to have a go at a variety of desparate adventures.<br />These characters collide with William Holden, a Bogey who represents the average sensual man central to American policy during the war and since, who is unwilling to get shot at for the dear old school-house, said dear old school-house having been for many American, Depression era enlisted men reform school, the orphanage, or the Big House.<br />Of course, Lean made this film before Vietnam which displayed clearly that American policy is no more exportable than British.  Our \\"development\\" model tells people in other lands that we share self-interest, but it is simply not the case that all men are motivated by self-interest.<br />Also, the presentation of the Burmese gals in the movie is absurd, for the movie assumes without argument that an Asian woman will fall in love with an American: a trope common enough in the 1950s, ridiculous today.  <br />In Kwai, Alec Guiness drives the Japanese commander crazy by his insistence on simultaneously collaborating with the enemy, and showing him that, don't you know, only Englishmen know how to build a bridge.  The central paradox of WWII and the subsequent world is that the POW's situation has been generalized, and most men in an administered world wind up constructing pieces of same in an alienated fashion.<br />The average sensual man tries, as do the POWs in the camp, to get away with a minimalist committment.  As a representative of a generation of British and American men which has died off, Guinness sees that it would demoralize the men to do a bad job but this causes him to violate his own military's rules.<br />Guinness' old-school thinking is a form of Benthamite utilitarianism in which the individual including the commander is willing not only to sacrifice his life for the greater good of the whole, but his personal integrity.  Holden's way of thinking will be more familiar to modern day me generation men both British and American who base their worldview on individual, inviolable rights.  <br />Recently, David Bowie revived the iron beauty of this committment as a cinematic trope in Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, where Bowie plays a Lord Jim type figure who is willing (because of personal betrayals back home) to sacrifice himself for his men.  <br />However, American audiences rejected Lawrence, and it is unlikely they would, today, accept the clash of world-views in Kwai.  Today, there is no sense of the upper-class military officer willing to sacrifice himself for his men, and indeed, this entire theme was short-lived.  It probably arose as a result of the *kindermord* of the trenches of WWI in an attempt, by the generation of the 1920s, to make some sense of the death of older brothers; for from the 17th century to the Edwardian era, British officers scorned their men as scum, scrapings, leavings and riff-raff, a scorn memorialized in the Duke of Wellington's comment: \\"I do not know whether they will frighten the French: but by G-d they frighten me.\\"<br />The final judgement of the MO (medical officer) makes what sense there is, and that is the pity of war, a pity we've perhaps forgotten.  America has returned to the Philippines, and England (with strange enthusiasm) to Afghanistan.  For there is, as Kipling knew, an attraction to colonialism as an alternative to solving problems back home.
B00005V0X5|4.0|Finally, a remastered album that sounds like its been redone. <BR>While this album won't do anything to change the minds of anyone not into this genre of music, those who own the original will notice a great deal of improvement.<BR>The most noticable improvements are with Dave Mustaine's vocals and Gar Samuelson's drums. You can actually understand what the hell Dave's rambling on about.<BR>The songs where the sound quality really shines are &quot;Looking Down The Cross&quot; and &quot;Killing Is My Business..&quot;<BR>Even &quot;Mechanix&quot; sounds louder.<BR>Too bad about the censored version of &quot;These Boots&quot; though. Not their fault, it's explained in the booklet.<BR>The demos included really show where Dave was headed with this band, even if his vocals are a little funny sounding at the time.<BR>A good buy for a 'Deth fan, or someone into old-school metal.
0786915749|5.0|I credit the DragonLance Saga for really drawing me into the world of reading. Any teacher would recommend any book that keeps his or her students reading for pleasure outside of school, and this book did it for me. Dragons of Autumn Twilight and the rest of Chronicles are the only books I've ever read twice for fun. The characters are dynamic, even if it does not seem apparent in the first book, and you'll soon identify with each one for different reasons. The pacing is intuitive and even the &quot;slow&quot; parts are engrossing. This is one book I will always recommend and will always find a space on my bookshelf.
6304981635|5.0|I loved Enter the Dragon.  Its definetely one of the greatest martial art films of all time and its also my favorite Bruce Lee movie so far.  If you like martial art films, you will definetely like this one, with out a doubt.
0060931736|5.0|It's with a sense of real wistfullness that I remember this book. I am going to order another copy to relive the sense of interest and joy that I recall the first book inducing in me (hint, if I don't edit this review, it means that my memory hasn't let me down)<br />A great book, that will induce a sense of confidence in girls, the charactarisation is that good. It's a real classic, energetically written, and I think every young person should be given the opportunity to read it. It's a little unconventional, even now, and it's difficult not to warm to the personalisation of Miss Brodie. This book makes you think of every person who has ever made a difference in your life, and treasure their memory.

B00003CXN4|1.0|4 stars to this? Best picture nomination to this? Oscars to this?<BR>Well, Hollywood has sunk again. No script. No story. No plot. And Catherine Zeta-Jones is as dislikable as ever.<br />And let me saw Benicio is one ugly mother. His acting?<BR>Lame as hell! And an Oscar to it!

B00005RHGL|4.0|This review covers the \\"Vista Series\\" 2 disc boxed director's cut DVD.<br />For those of us who love Westerns, we have to take what we can get nowadays. There are few if any, being made.  So this is a refreshing re-packaging of an already great movie.  The sound is first rate and the photography excellent.  Most of this film has tried to be historically accurate down to guns, costumes, saddles etc; a great portion is detailed in the bonus dvd, including interviews with the actors and director.  Historical facts are brought out and detailed, behind the scenes looks, and a folded map are even included in this very well packaged set.<br />Kurt Russell looks very much like the real Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer's \\"star turn\\" as Doc Holliday is great fun to watch.  Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, deliver servicable performances.  Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brosius is great as an Earp nemesis. I won't go into great detail about the movie itself as most people have already read other reviews since this movie has been out.  But if you want to upgrade from VHS or the regular DVD, I highly recommend this set.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Star Wars is one of the most lamest, overrated films in history much like Lord of the Good 'Ol Ringos. Same goes for this.<br />What is it with trilogies? They are pointless, usless things to make people anticipate the next film and trick you into believing in something that is not there.<br />First off, let me say, if a human being can comprehend the story<BR>within this movie, kudos to them. On the otherhand, kill them<BR>off so a movie like this will never exist again.<br />To boot, every actor in here is annyoing as can be. I never like Liam, and I think it would take a lot to make me. Ewan is ugly,<BR>and that goes for the Portman chick as well. I don't mean to be shallow, but hey, if you can't stand to look at the actors what is the point?<br />The film never ceases. End already!

0060955775|5.0|The poetic writing and rythm of Coelho will take you on a journey into the self-reflefction and spiritual rebirth of a girl who is young, pretty, and seemingly has everything - but decides to die. <br />You witness a girl who has forced herself to stop feeling to rediscover hate as well as joy. You see how the unconditional and self-sacrificing love of parents can cause a child anguish and guilt for wanting to be individual rather than living up to their expectations. <br />And as Veronika allows herself to feel emotions, and live life to its fullest in a way only a person with only five days left to live can; you witness the impact it has on others around her, as well as yourself.<br />Coelho takes you on a journey to rediscover that every day, we have choices - and we make choices - in living our lives the way we live it today.
6305878323|5.0|Another quote from the movie that accurately describes this classic. The music, dancing, and singing all make a great film. The DVD includes the best extras, like the making of featurette as well as film from the movie's premiere. This is a top-notch Disney musical that belongs in any DVD collection.
0783225792|2.0|come on-- it seems like Scorsese only has one movie in him-- Goodfellas and its younger clones. The film just really is so un-original it's almost stunning; so filled with mob movie cliches you can literally predict it scene by scene. Pesci is the small sadistic psychopath who by the end of the movie \\"goes too far\\" and is bumped off by his former associates in a \\"crime doesn't pay\\" ending. Believe me, that gave nothing away. <br />What I found particularly annoying were the little \\"real life bits\\" that were pretty innovative when Godfather came out but now form the entirety of that pathetic show, The Sopranos. What I mean by \\"real life bits\\" are, for instance, when these blood-soaked mob men spend five minutes talking about pasta, or they respect their old Italian mothers, or, in this film, spending five minutes discussing the details of digging a hole in the desert. (sarcastically:) It's such a great contrast! (not sarcastically:) This spiel is SO played out. Really gets on my nerves.<br />As for the \\"gritty, realistic\\" violence-- it's so expected it loses all impact. Of COURSE a Scorsese flick is gonna have Pesci beating ... someone. Big deal.<br />All in all, a poor, execrably long waste.
0802136834|3.0|First I want to applaud Ms. Weir on her research and attention to detail.  It was nice to read a more detailed description of Henry VIII than what you usually get in this type book.  So much of the book was spent on Katherine of Aragon and so little on the other 5 wives that I was somewhat dissapointed.  There seems to be more information available on Katherine of Aragon, however I question the attention paid to some of the sources Ms. Weir has used. Not the validity of them but the obvious bias of the sources.  And Ms. Weir continued her unfortunate habit of losing her objectivity part way through the book.  I found this thoroughly frustrating in her book &quot;The Princes in the Tower&quot; and almost as frustrating in this book.  Still, this is an interesting book if you can overlook the obvious bias she has when writing of Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn.
0060975768|4.0|In this work, Moore carefully reconstructs the battles of the Ia Drang Valley in great detail by employing both his personal memories of the experiences, as well as those of other men involved in the bloody conflict.  The personal nature of the accounts presented in this work adds great credibility to Moore's claims.  Each man, though incapable of knowing the exact details of every aspect of the battles, adds greater clarity to the overall picture through his personalized interpretation of his experience.  The horrible realities and incomprehensible fear of taking part in such a conflict come to life for the reader through the painful memories of the men who experienced the battles first-hand, both taking bullets and having to watch their friends die at their sides.  One unifying theme runs throughout the accounts of the contributing soldiers; each soldier gained a healthy respect for the perseverance and fighting capability of their under-armed, but not incapable enemy of the North Vietnamese Army.  Though the American fighting force enjoyed much more powerful equipment and maneuverability with their Airmobile divisions, the North Vietnamese fought with unquestionable bravery and ferocity regardless of the strength of the enemy's weaponry and technology.  Moore believes this indicated a great deal about the enemy's determination that would continue throughout the duration of the bloody conflict.<BR> <BR>Though the Americans inflicted casualties upon the North Vietnamese regulars at a ratio of 12:1, Lt. Gen. Moore knew this statistic did not accurately represent an overwhelming success for the American fighting forces involved in the battles of Ia Drang Valley.  He and the soldiers that fought under his command witnessed firsthand the unquestionable sacrifices the North Vietnamese proved willing to make in fighting the American forces for their cause.  Not only did the Vietnamese prove exceptionally determined in fighting for their cause, but they also exercised a battlefield effectiveness that demanded the respect of the American fighting force.  In short, Moore argues that from the outset of the battles of Ia Drang Valley, the American military had engaged an enemy that they could not afford to underestimate in neither capability nor determination and willingness to take on the larger and better-equipped American military.<BR> <BR>Another important aspect of Lt. Gen. Moore's narrative includes the insight he provides into the realities of the American foot soldier's experience in this conflict.  Surrounded by dying comrades and making unimaginable personal sacrifices, the men who fought for America in Vietnam forged a bond that only they can fully comprehend and respect.  The love and loyalty depicted in the accounts of Moore and the other men involved in the Ia Drang engagement helps the reader to identify with the situation of the American soldiers fighting a war that they had not fully grasped, nor understood the severity of, until their closest friends fell victim to enemy fire in a merciless conflict.  In this respect, Moore's and his soldiers' accounts of the battles of the Ia Drang Valley give the reader an understanding of the conflict in Vietnam that transcends the impersonality and limitations of mere battle statistics concerning numbers of killed and/or wounded.  Moore shows that many heroes fought in the Ia Drang Valley, on both sides of the conflict, and regardless of overall judgments and interpretations of the Vietnam War, these men warrant respect for their bravery during those horrendous days in mid-November 1965.
6305807043|5.0|Rarely will you come across a movie that gives such a concept-- and that concept continues to push the movie in its storytelling where you continue to watch wondering what's going to happen next, what else can be \\"done\\" with this unique concept.  Add this all with quirky characters, the unusual 7 1/2 floor, a puppeteer who displays his art in an untraditional way (in a scene that should go down as one of the classic off-beat comedy scenes in history!)  And that's before we're introduced to the tunnel/portal that leads you into being inside the actor, John Malkovich-- and then that leads to exploration of love and sex between characters, it's totally off the wall and totally engrossing!<br />If you're looking for something different, something that does not tell Hollywood stories, something that puts art house classics to shame, this is it!  Just goes to show the \\"fantastic,\\" or \\"magical realism\\" of which this movie manages to sit so nicely in between is not only alive and well but maybe this is the proof that telling original stories through movies is still possible!
B00005YTFG|5.0|I think it is obvious that you either LOVE this movie or get sick watching it.  Personally I am one of the ones that loves it!  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun movie with a good story line and a wonderful original song.  Nicole Kidman did an excellent job, despite what people say.  Sure, there could have been a bit better singing job done, but considering she actually sang, unlike many musicals where the songs are dubbed, I would say it's excellent!  I would much rather have an awesome actress that sings very well than a TERRIBLE actress that sings extremely well!  It is a movie, NOT a music album.  I would tell everyone to try it out, and if it's not your favorite that's that, but at least you have experienced it!
B00000I1OY|5.0|he said he was going to swim home&quot; - John Cheever's &quot;The Swimmer&quot;, is a powerful and sadly underrated film and one of John Cheever's jewels in a collection of masterful short stories. A pillar of success he seems at first, still strong and capable at 55 and ready to conquer his county by swimming the long stretch home. This stretch is crossed by highways and public places but the majority of his journey are the pools of his affluent neighbors, and he invades these trophy nests in a near naked state, like a golden Olympian. It is a peak performance for the aging Lancaster, an actor who was famous for his bravado to become a man who loses the battle in the upstream currents of life and to find no redemption at the end. What at first seems like a silly flight of fancy (by one of their own) is thrown in question when we see how outside the boundaries of their social world he has fallen... his illusion of privilege is seriously chipped away at when he is leered at a public pool which for him was like &quot;a stagnat bend in the Lucinda River&quot; and even Lucinda is a figment of his imagination - as his wife Lucinda has long left him and we soon realize what going home means. This film is not just a small slice of a bygone Americana and one mans fall from grace, it sends a beacon across our landscape and shows the cracks in America's (fragile) foundation built like Ned Merrills life - on dreams and myths.
0451169514|5.0|This book is a masterpiece, It really shows the depths of Kings imagination.  It is also very similar to the book &quot;Ghost Story&quot; by Peter Straub, which I think is where IT originated.

Her roller coaster dieting, attempts to quit smoking, and self-conscious wit keep the reader intrigued from beginning to end.  <br />If you like books like the &quot;Ya-Ya Sisterhood,&quot; and &quot;Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing,&quot; you'll love this one.
0446310786|4.0|Usually, cildren never experience the horror of murder but in Scout & Jem Finch's case (in To Kill a Mockingbird) it's different.  The author uses Scout's perspective perfectly, all through Scout's early years.  This book tells how Scout's brother (Jem) breaks his arm.  The author touches very hevily on racism and predjudeces.  This book will make anyone grasping for more, while still wanting there to be no more.<br />     The Author of this book obviously wanted everyone to understand the fights Jem & Scout get into.  The vocabulary is just above mediocre and (even though there are no pictures) you can invision everything. For ex: When Jem & Scout are cornered you can imagine every motion of their fight with a predjuduced man.  (It's the same with Scout's school \\"troubles\\".)<br />     Lee wants everyone to fully understand about racism and how horrific it is.  I mean just about everyone in Maycomb is a racist.  Lots of the characters particularly Bob Ewell were racists (Bob Ewell showed it after the verduct of Tim Robinson's trial).  It sickens you to read quotes in this book, such as: \\"it made one down and about two ore to go.\\"<br />     Even though this book is full of evil incidents, there is a hero.  A simpleton by the name of Boo Radly.  Sure he is reclusive and seems like a freak at first, but he soon saves Scout and Jem's lives thereby making him a modern day superhero.  Even though he does this by killing Bob Ewell, he comes out as the glorious shining, hero in this dark and moving novel.<br />     All readers will love To Kill a Mockingbird.  It goes healvily into the heart of Maycomb bringing out racism and predjuduces.  Even though it touches on such a harsh subject, most readers will understand the points this writer is trying to make.
1577311523|4.0|This is an excellent book that I decided to get after reading all the positive reviews. I once experienced enlightenment many years ago and have since been looking for a way of recreating that feeling. <BR>While this book has not allowed me to do that yet, I'm sure with practice that it will occur sooner or later.<BR>The book is written in an question-answer format style that makes it easy to read. Furthermore, the material is repeated many times over such that the core contents of the book could actually be presented in less than half the number of pages.<BR>One of my complaints is that while most of the text is quite practical, it can get relatively spiritual at times. Other than that the book was worth the price. In fact I'm reading it second time round.<BR>Another book worth mentioning that is far more practical and is a much quicker read is \\"Working on yourself does'nt work\\".
1587990717|1.0|Taleb makes some valid observations on most peoples' weak skills at understanding randomness. But these are fairly simple, and described well elsewhere. And, what a bore Taleb is! He opens the book with one Nero Tulip (a weak pun on his own name) and then spends most of the book arrogantly and humorlessly talking about himself. He aspires to intellectualism, and drops more names than I can count. Some he idolizes, others he treats with extreme contempt. The second part of the book is a discombobulated collection of platitudes. Random, without a discernible signal, like most of what he tells us we shouldn't be reading. There is a thinly veiled promotion of his hedge fund (if \\"all the quants\\" use poor tools and misunderstand randomness, where does his wisdom come from?) An inelegant book that includes a lecture on personal elegance. <br />There is little of substance here. Save your money and time.
0385501560|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk is an amazing writer. Every aspect of this book oozes with imagery and detail. Everything from a \\"powdery crushed velvet mess\\" of skin to \\"brown and glistening\\" pudding, Palahniuk paints the reader a vivid picture of the world and it's inhabitants. However this I just the painting, the frame is what makes it great. The story is written so that one chapter will discuss current events and the next will describe Victor's past. Eventually these two will meet and bring the reader to a full understanding of Mr. Mancini's situation. <BR>The novel provides a fresh take on reality, pointing out the various faults, or emotions that society has as a whole. If you took the novel as educational, which it most likely is not intended to be, it very well could change your perception of life. However, it will most likely not prove that powerful to most. <BR>In short the book is fantastic, everything from the characters, to the writing, to the structure all make this an absolute must read. It dodoes contain a good amount of sex, seeing as how Victor's a recovering Sexaholic. Some minor profanity. And A little drug use by some of Victor's coworkers. Basically if you didn't like fight club you won't like this book. BUT if you even moderately enjoyed Fight Club Check out or otherwise purchase this Novel SOON, QUICK, IMMEDIATELY! Choke is a book for those tired of the average book; it's a rude awakening into reality.
B00005TT77|2.0|It's not the worst Beatles covers ever, but the soundtrack to this film doesn't work because most of the song versions are way too faithful to the timeless originals. Being these are some of my favorite musicians, I was disappointed at the lack of creativity shown throughout the CD. With that said, standouts include Ben Harper's reworking of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, done with almost a smoky, burning intensity, and Rufus Wainwright's rendition of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. Get it if you like the Beatles, but you may be disappointed with the staleness of it all.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris's humor clearly appeals to a distinctive taste.  Some times it is warped bordering on creepy (particularly in &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot;), but often his wry observations are very poignant.  What I particularly appreciate is his ability to laugh at himself.  He may poke fun at any and all, but he also doesn't take himself seriously.<br />Having really enjoyed &quot;Naked&quot; I was very disappointed by the critical reviews in the press for &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;.  Generally, reviewers flayed him for being too caustic and harshly criticizing Americans abroad now that he is an ex-pat. <br />I am glad that I finally overcame my reluctance and read this book.  I did not find &quot;Me Talk Pretty&quot; at all divergent from his other works; in fact it is equally satisfyiing.  His wit here is consistently savage about the ignorant and rude, with an endearing appreciation of the quotidian and absurd. He continues to pugnaciously defend his right to an unhealthy habits, including tobacco and alcohol, and foods of dubious nutrition.  Of course, appreciating Sedaris the reader has to recognize that he recognizes what is wrong and self destructive about these things and that he is mocking himself.<br />Contrary to the prevailing opinion of the reviews (did they read the book or each other?) I didn't detect any sense that he has become a Francophile.  In fact, his French hiatus has served as a foil that has enhanced his perspective on the United States, and has made his observations more insightful and he seems, in his own twisted way, to be more appreciative of many things here.<br />I didn't enjoy every one of the essays; however, I didn't expect to either.  Overall I did enjoy the collection, and while occasionally a bit too odd, I do find Sedaris's distinctive, absurd, and mostly sage humor quite refreshing.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is without a doubt the most important rock record of the 90s... it's brilliance, emotion, and artistry has yet to, and may never be equalled. Every song is a work of art, written and arranged flawlessly, and executed to perfection. What we have here is a sonic odyssey.... each note seems meaningful in some way, in certain places almost transcending the boundaries of music.<br />Tool's goal is to let their art speak for them, and Aenima does just that. Maynards lyrics and delivery are powerful enough to move and vague enough to allow the listener to create their own interpretation. Guitar/bass/drums/vocals blend and function together as one instrument. <br />However, even if you prefer not to delve deeper into Tool's sonic landscape, Aenima is a bad... rock/metal album that is filled with infectiously catchy (and occasionally epic) songs, breathtaking vocals and a sound so original and monumental, that there are no words to describe it. Some complain that the segues are pointless... they add character to the record and without them it would seem much less enigmatic. So stop reading and hit play.
0679601686|5.0|This is my favourite book in the world!!  This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.<br />I have read &quot;Pride and Prejuduce&quot; several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Darcy snub and then fall for the prejudice Lizzy, who is far from willing to give him a chance.  However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.<br />Lizzy's father, Mr Bennett, is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Austen's books.  Mrs Bennett is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her!  Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Darcy.  I have to agree with Jane Austen, as her favourite character of her books is Miss Elizabeth Bennett.<br />This is a book that can be read time and time again.  Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down.  If you ever get a chance to watch the BBC TV series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it's 6 hours long!!<br />This is the best story that Jane Austen wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years.
0345413377|2.0|Our family listened to the first book on tape and loved it.  We were anxious to hear more about Lyra and her adventures in the \\"other world\\" she entered at the end of the book.<br />Fortunately, I decided to read books two and three before passing them on to my preteen.  <br />These books, especially \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" are so overtly anti-religion that I would be astonished if anyone nominating them for Parents' Awards has actually read all three books.  The underlying theme is that there is no G-d, and that the mission of \\"the Church\\" is to prevent mankind from seeking or gaining wisdom.  Further, the Church undertakes unspeakable evil to attain this goal.  Only through the loss of innocence of two 12-year olds can mankind (and all sentient beings in billions of alternative but simultaneous worlds) truly be saved.  The \\"Authority\\" (G-d, who isn't -really- G-d) is depicted as a decrepit, senile old man who ultimately dissipates when his glass encasement is broken and he's exposed to air. The \\"Regent of Heaven,\\" once a man and now a powerful angel, wages war among the worlds to preserve the status quo.<br />I certainly did come to care about the adventurers in this series:  Lyra, Will, Dr. Mary, Serafina Pekkala, and my favorite, Iorek Bearnison.  Pullman does a wonderful job breathing life into his characters.  But the delivery of such vehement anti-religious sentiment left me absolutely stunned---and resolute that my child will NOT be reading this series as long as she's a child.
B000000WCV|4.0|This is a fun record... anyone buying this record looking for salvation will probably be disappointed, but if you want a fun, funky, dance record, then this is it... I love it personally, and it always hypes me up when I listen to it... just listen to the wicked... beats on Revolution 909, the soothing waves on Fresh, the funky bass of Around the World, the discoy feel of High Fidelity... it's great fun, and if you like dance music, you need this in your collection... if you like music you need it, for some variety... it's great fun, pick it up...
B00005UEAR|2.0|Talk about a disappointment!  The band seems to have sacrificed originality for track length.  Sections of The Great Debate sound like they were taken directly from Tool, the keyboards sound just like the work already done on Liquid Tension Experiment, and the entire theme for the Overture is so cliche, I want to puke.  <br />I have been a longtime Dream Theater fan since Images and Words, and own every single release they have ever done, plus an entire bookcase of bootlegs.  I love Dream Theater, but this CD is almost a waste.  In my opinion, the best two songs on this release are The Glass Prison, and Misunderstood, but the Glass Prison ends abruptly making me wonder what just happened, and Misunderstood has two atonal experimental sections thrown into it that have nothing to do with the rest of the song.  I really can't stand Portnoy's vocals, and they are prevalent on this CD.  I do really like the lyrics, and Labrie's vocals are strong, but I just can't help but think I've heard all of this before somewhere...
B00005R2M3|4.0|She is hot and this cd proves it....with her ability to pour out her soul in English and Spanish, backed by some good beats, these tracks are worth getting into....
B000000H4V|5.0|With the release of CAOS A.D., SEPULTURA has hit a peak and a maturity in their sound. Yes the music is still fast heavy and hard, but the sounds and riffs just seem to get better with each release up until Max left the band. Yes ARISE is a freakin killer album, but CAOS is better in my opinion. The riffs are killer, Igor's drumming is just unbeliveable and there is still Max's trademark growls and snarls. The lyrics are still angry and have a meaning to them. REFUSE/RESIST, TERRITORY, and SLAVE NO WORLD kick the album off and these songs will have you thrasing and banging your head in no time at all. We also get to see some elements of the tribal influences on this album with some of the rhythms. One track that is a real welcome surprise is KAIOWAS, which really has that tribal sound to it and just might be the sleeper hit of the album. For those who think that SEPULTRUA has sold out or got soft, I beg to differ. They obviously grew up as musicians and experimented with their sound. This album still rocks, but it is more mature sound that only indicated where the band was heading as witnessed on their next classic album ROOTS. I highly recommend this for all music fans. It is way better than anything out right now, 10 years after it was released. One more thing, dont forget to give AMEN, and PROPAGANDA a listen, those songs rock hard. METAL RULES
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is unmistakenly the best movie I have ever seen. In the first 10 minutes it assaults all your senses, with nerve wracking pleasure. Just keep an open mind and your eyes open and absorb all the motion, music, sounds and its beauty. If you can't get this movie out of your mind then it did its job. This is truly an exciting movie
B000001EC1|5.0|This CD remains timeless as the fullest collection of Bon Jovi's greatest songs ever. The CD hits hard and hits home with the best stuff Bon Jovi and Company have ever made. A must for any music collection!

I LUVVVVVV car films! gone in 60 seconds is probaly my uther favourite movie.<BR>THIS IS A CAR MOVIE.<BR>Ive read other reviews sayin the actings bad, bad plot, unrealistic etc. Ok the plots not the best but that wasnt what i was lookin for. Rob Cohen has shown the culture of illegal street racing perfectly.FIT girls, FIT cars and rock hard guys. Especially like vin diesels character Toretto. The cars are brilliant, races are brill and you havent got a dead complicated plot. WATCH THIS FILM!
0688152023|5.0|I practice yoga and Pilates daily. I bought the New York City Ballet Workout to try something fun and different. I now wake up every day actually EXCITED to do this workout. The stretches are similar to yoga postures and the muscle groups worked on are the same as a classic Pilates syllabus. Although I haven't practiced ballet for over 20 years (since I stopped taking lessons at age 9!) the positions are easy to follow and replicate. There's even a bit of cardio in the Little Jumps section! I use this DVD three or four times a week and can not praise it enough; it's fun, challenging, and interesting. The only drawback is the running time....with two children under three, I really have to budget my time wisely in order to complete the workout. A must have for any \\"workout library\\"!!!!
B00005T30L|5.0|To begin with, let&#8217;s dispel any misconception that his is just another &#8220;teen&#8221; film; the main characters are teens, to be sure, but it is decidedly anything but.  Rather, it&#8217;s an examination of the methods we employ in the attempt to connect with the world in which we live, and how we negotiate our own specific time, place and environment.  A comedy/drama by director Terry Zwigoff, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; explores what it means to be on the outside looking in, without necessarily wanting to be on the inside, but unsure of what the next move should be or to whom or what we should reach out and embrace.  And, as the story unfolds, we discover that the elusive answers have much to do with our own preferences and perceptions of a world in a constant state of flux that refuses to slow down or wait for us to make our decisions.<br /> Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) have just graduated from high school.  Their plans for the future include sharing an apartment-- and so far, that&#8217;s it.  Toward that end, Rebecca has secured a job at a local Starbucks, but Enid is stuck in the procrastination phase, job-search wise.  Be advised, however, these two are no &#8220;Romy and Michele;&#8221; mature beyond their years-- especially Enid-- they have a jaded, cynical view of the world in which they live and those who populate it.  They possess a keen insight into human nature, but regard those around them with a rather cold and detached perspective.  They observe people, Enid sometimes sketching them from a distance, and often they follow their subjects just to see where they go and what they might do.  Life to them is something of an academic character study, with perhaps an underlying sense that by so doing they just may stumble onto their own niche-- though without realizing what they&#8217;re doing themselves. <br /> It&#8217;s all fairly harmless, at any rate, until one day they inadvertently get too close to one of their marks, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a man they view initially as a pathetic little geek.  They initiate an incident involving him that is cruel in the extreme, and when they follow it up rather than just dropping it and letting it (and Seymour) go, their lives take an unexpected turn, and for the first time they get caught up in their own scheme of deceit.  And it&#8217;s a step toward the inevitable changes we all face in our lives-- and slowly they begin to understand at least one thing:  That once the die is cast, there is no going back.<br /> From the outset, you realize these characters are not your typical, average cinematic teens, and as the story evolves, Zwigoff does an exemplary job of developing them.  They change, they evolve; and you see it.  And given the fact that this story is adapted from a comic book, there is an unexpected depth to it, along the lines of &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; or &#8220;The Ice Storm.&#8221;  It&#8217;s funny, as well-- hilarious, in fact-- but the humor is never contrived or forced, but flows quite naturally from the characters and their situations, just as in real life where you find that even the most serious situation has a humorous side, though to find it you may have to take a step back and look for it.  Zwigoff allows us to take that step back and see that side, along with the drama; and the result is a film that is funny, incisive, insightful, and at times extremely moving and poignant.  The ending alone is enough to initiate hours of discussion.  Extremely well crafted and delivered, Zwigoff&#8217;s work here should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it is clearly superior to some that were rewarded with that honor.<br /> For years now, in numerous films, from &#8220;Fargo&#8221; to the sleeper &#8220;Trees Lounge,&#8221; Steve Buscemi has been one of the best character actors in the business, and the role of Seymour is arguably his best work to date.  And inexplicably, like Zwigoff, the Academy overlooked him.  Buscemi&#8217;s Seymour is the epitome of a regular guy who, if not exactly content with his life, accepts it and has no delusions as to who and what he is; and Buscemi plays him beautifully.  There&#8217;s a touch of Donnie from &#8220;The Big Lebowski&#8221; in him, but with much more depth, and an attitude that is decidedly acquiescent.  This is a guy who doesn&#8217;t expect much, because he knows he&#8217;ll never get it anyway.  It&#8217;s an engagingly subtle and honest portrayal that also gives definition to the contrast between his stage of life and that of Enid and Rebecca&#8217;s.  Buscemi was perfectly cast in this part-- absolutely no one could have played Seymour better.<br /> One of the true revelations of this film, however, is in the emergence of Thora Birch, who turns in an absolutely commanding performance.  All that she&#8217;s done previously has been but a warm-up for her portrayal of Enid, which, without question, will propel her already successful career to an even higher level.  With an understated and oh-so-subtle manner, she manages to convey so much about what is going on behind Enid&#8217;s eyes; all the emotion, all the confusion that hides behind her mask of external indifference.  Birch knows her character inside and out, and presents Enid accordingly, letting us know unequivocally how she feels about those around her, including Rebecca, her father (Bob Balaban), and especially Seymour-- through her relationship with whom we learn so much about her.  It&#8217;s terrific work by an extremely gifted young actor.<br /> Johansson gives a striking performance, as well, though her character is ultimately overshadowed by Birch&#8217;s Enid.  But it&#8217;s good work, and one of the strengths of the film.<br /> The supporting cast includes Brad Renfro (Josh), Illeana Douglas (Roberta) and Stacy Travis (Dana).  Filled with memorable characters and scenes, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; is a thoughtful and highly entertaining film, deservedly recognized withan Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.  This is the magic of the movies.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Six Degrees is to Dream Theater what Thanksgiving dinner is to food. But is it too much of a good thing? I'm afraid that now that DT know that they're not gonna get much radio time, they've started to skimp on the lyrical content and just go for the thrash. Then again if people want lyrical content they should probably go buy Bob Dylan instead of DT! If you want typical DT musical gymnastics then Six Degrees is THE album for you!!!<BR>The album is great all the way through thus my five star rating. But Six Degrees sounds a little too much like the band members side projects(with the exception of Mullmuzzler). Kevin Moore's influence has never been missed more than it is here. The band sounds best on Misunderstood and Disappear when they take it down a notch and stretch their boundaries a bit. I find DT's past efforts much more balanced. On Awake you rock out to Lie and Mirror and then out of nowhere comes Space Dye Vest. And on Falling into Infinity they managed to balance Burning My Soul with Take Away my Pain(even without Moore's influence). But Six Degrees just keeps on pounding along unrestrained. <BR>No band gives its fans more for their money than Dream Theater but I think that the band would be better served in the future by dialing back the gymnastics on their DT efforts and saving the extended soloing for Liquid Tension, Transatlantic and such.<BR>I realize that its the virtuosity of the muscians that have made Dream Theater what they are. But the bottom line is that a whole album of Erotomania-like guitar isn't half as interesting as 3 minutes of Surrounded.
6305499365|4.0|If you work in the corporate world - you know how true this movie is! The red stapler in the movie, I saw it on swingline.com. I got it and it's great! It makes me think of this funny movie every time I use it!
B00000JCOV|1.0|Well, after seeing these guys I know what humans have evolved from.  This is just bad music.  Ok.  It's not music. It's sound.  I could make this album in an afternoon.  Chances are you could too.  Their is no sense of melody or musical structure, it's just \\"hey should I hit my head off my drum kit here?\\" , \\"do it man, we're all so mad!\\" <br />Music is a form of art and I respect that.  But art has to be creative, this just isn't.  Masks?  Ripoffs.  Try Mr. Bungle about a decade ago.  There's some truly crazy music that IS a form of art.  <br />This shouldn't appeal to anyone who has evolved.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|of time and money. This has to be one of the worst films ever made. I agree with a lot of reviewers here that this movie has very little plot and the musical numbers???? They are all 70's or 80's songs that really have no place in Paris 1900! I watched this movie with my wife and another couple and they wanted to turn it off halfway thorough, but I said it HAS to get better let's keep watching it. WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How anybody can think this is a good movie is beyond me. The first 20 minutes the camera is moving so fast and is always at some kind of angle (like the old Batman TV series) that as soon as you turn your head the camera moves again. Halfway through the film all of us where laughing at how stupid this movie is. HOW and WHY this movie was ever made will always be a mystery. The acting is horrible! Nicole Kidman can't act and now can't sing( if she ever could)! Ewan McGregor kept looking like he didn't want to be there! John Leguizamo as the Dwarf was unbearable!  If you like to get headaches and like really stupid movies, like \\"Dude, where's my car?\\" then this movie is for you! One star is too many for this movie! WORST!!!!!!!
B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot is noise, just noise.  This album sounds like nine guys taking their respective instruments and throwing them down a long flight of stairs.  The worst thing about this &quot;band&quot; is that people think it's metal...Sure metal if loud, metal is fast, and sometimes angry but it's not this.<br />What makes me even more mad is the fact that I've seen kids half my age (I'm 20) wearing Slipknot shirts and saying how their music &quot;speaks to them&quot; and how they relate to it.  Slipknot's unrelenting &quot;anger&quot; is apparently driven by the fact that they come from a barren state.  Well, cry me a river...a whole lot of people do too.  These other people have expressed themselves in much more creative and artistic ways.  <br />This album is complete drivel...if you're ten and extremely angry for your age then you'll love these guys.  If you're not, then you should find them as laughable as I do.
B00003CX96|5.0|Another wonderful feature about the DVD version of this outstanding film: in the subtitles, the DVD producers took the time to include the Italian phrases and lyrics that were so integral to the story. For example, when Dave is riding down a Bloomington street on his bike, singing an Italian opera, you can enable the subtitles and see the Italian words. When he's serenading &quot;Kathy&quot; outside her sorority house, the Italian lyrics are available. And when he's trying to converse with the wise-guy professional bicyclists from Team Cinzano, the Italian dialog is shown. It's great fun. Most DVDs don't include this feature. It was a nice touch!
B00004XOWM|1.0|Ok I'll keep this short...<br />The band (not Durst) has talent.  Wes Borland is an innovative guitar player, Sam Rivers a good bassist, John Otto a great drummer and DJ Lethal is untouchable since House of Pain... but Fred...my God, you're awful!!<br />The so called \\"lyrics\\" on this album are nothing more than immature swearing, \\"Hot Dog\\" or nothing more than boasting about how tough and \\"ghetto\\" Fred is(Rolling)...The average intelligence level of everyone has decresed after this album was released and if another one comes out (come on guys, follow Wes's lead) then it will truly be the nail in the coffin for humanity.  Do not pick this up.  It is neither \\"phat\\" nor \\"crunk\\"(whatever that's supposed to mean).  Just plain awful.
0743201140|4.0|We all have asked or been asked the interview question, &quot;What are your strengths?&quot;  Buckingham and Clifton provide convincing rationale for asking that question as well as concrete terminology to answer the question.   But this is not a &quot;get you through the interview&quot; book.  The authors clearly articulate why you should be asking this question to both yourself and to those you hire.<br />&quot;First Break All the Rules&quot; (the precursor to Now Discover Your Strengths) challenged managers to concentrate on, search for, hire for, and nurture strengths.  &quot;Now Discover Your Strengths&quot; gives managers the tools (an on-line strengths assessment and several open-ended questions) and language (34 signature themes) to make that possible on the individual, departmental, or organizational level.  <br />Why would any person or organization want to focus on strengths?  Buckingham and Clifton claim 8 out of 10 employees are in positions that do not capitalize on their strengths; thus, they are not performing at maximum or even baseline levels of productivity.  Certainly, this is an unacceptable level regardless of the size of your organization or the type of industry in which you work.  If that isn't enough, the authors posit other reasons including:  1) increased employee retention, 2) increased job satisfaction, 3) decreased absenteeism, 4) decreased on-the-job accidents and worker compensation claims - just to mention a few.<br />However rather than focus on the fact that so many of us function outside of our strengths, take Buckingham and Clifton's advice. Discover your strengths and began the journey that could redefine the paradigms for your organization.  Based on the staggering amounts of research data collected by Gallup and the completion of an on-line Strengthsfinder assessment, you can determine your &quot;signature themes.&quot;  It is then up to you (with some suggestions from the authors) to develop your themes(or the signature themes of the people you supervise) into strengths.  <br />A quick and helpful read.  Recommended for any manager/supervisor or anyone grappling with career decisions.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie will change your life. I suggest you stop reading this and buy it. Lol. <BR>Ewan McGregor is amazing, amazing isn't even the word-stunning, magnificent, superlative, \\"incandiferous\\" as well as Nicole Kidman. Both sing so beautifully it will take your breath away. This movie is without a doubt in my mind, the best film ever written, acted, & directed. Its so visually stunning you can't breathe until it lets you go. As many times as I see it, I feel like I haven't seen everything there is to see, and I just want to watch it again until I catch every thing.
B000002JS0|5.0|The geatest hard rock band of all time started out with their first real album TNT in 75 or so, renamed High Voltage when sent to the US, with exeption of the 'school days/shes got balls swich they were the same. This is awesome material!! Its a long way to the top is incredible with the quite sucessfully used bagpipes adding a cool sound. TNT, the staple here is one of the best metal songs of all time, with austrailian accent chants and the style the world would soon know and love of AC/DC. Live Wire is also really good but the whole disk is good, as always. A real must have.
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is a peek into the lives and minds of two teenage girls who recently graduated high school. The story centers around Enid (Thora Birch) and her friend Rebecca. Steve Buscemi plays an older eccentric who the girls intially torment but with whom Enid eventually develops a relationship.<br />I liked this movie for its portrayal of the misfits and oddballs who live on the fringe of mainstream culture.<br />Terry Zwigoff directed the movie &quot;Crumb&quot; about the underground comic artist Robert Crumb and his mentally disturbed family. There are many odes to Crumb in this movie, most notably the character Seymore. Seymore, like Robert Crumb, is highly critical of modern pop culture and collects albums of Jazz and Blues artists from the early 20th century. Like Crumb he is socially inept and purposely isolates himself from other human beings.<br />Daniel Clowes is a superb storyteller with a talent for creating distinctive, believable characters. I've admired his art since the early nineties and the beginning of his semi-periodical comic &quot;Eightball&quot;.<br />The DVD of Ghost World has a video from a 1965 Indian Musical which plays briefly in the opening credits of the movie. I read in an interview that Clowes owned a copy of a copy of a copy of the video and would show it to anyone who came over to his house. It has nothing to do with the narrative of Ghost World but its sure to stick in your head as one of the most bizarre things you've ever seen.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is perhaps the best rock album of all time. Guns n' Roses may be inconsistent and sometimes their ideas can get in the way of their music talent but here they blend perfectly. Welcome to the Jungle is awesome and has awesome guitar and rhythm and everything. The legendary Sweet Child of also has great guitar rhythm and is a great pure song. paradise city is another great mix of sound and songwriting perfection. Nighttrain, out ta get me, brownstone, my Michelle, think about you and others are swweet tunes as well.

The title track is once again the standout probably titled as a hard rockers challenge to zeppelin's stairway to heaven. girls got rhythm, touch too much, shot down in flames, If you want blood and others are also quite good. No collection is complete with out this one.
B00005RHGK|2.0|I must admit the first hour of this movie scared me to death. After that it seems as though the writers and producers became uninterested and just wanted to get it over with. It became too Sci-Fi channel and not enough good old horror. A horror movie should stay true and not switch gears which this movie did absolutely terribly. It's almost as if they had 2 separate ideas for 2 separate movies but only enough money for one.
0679420266|5.0|This work is a fundamental piece of 20th century existentialism, and has survived its time because evidently man still suffers and does some very silly things. To those who criticize the artificiality of Mersault's lack of emotions,  the materiality of its existence or the absurdity of the novel, I extend my congratulations, because they must surely live a full and emotionally nurturing live, maybe pursuing actively the American Dream. If you fit in this description, you may want to read a book that makes common sense, like a thriller or Harry Potter. OTHERWISE, READ THIS BOOK  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS  a masterful depiction of the alienation of the modern human being, the anguish of existence and the absurdity of nothingness (maybe the gentlemen of the Nobel prize board didn't miss this point).

This book begins with the pigs taking charge, of the pigs two strong leaders emerge Napoleon, and Snowball, and each of them feels they are the best.  Eventually, Napoleon chases Snowball off using viscious dogs that he raised from pups so he has the majority of the power.  The irony in this book is awesome it comes rushing at you like a flash flood.  This book is targeted for young adult readers, and it is a quick read.<BR>     Anyone would like this book from the fifth grade on up.  Allthough it is more suited for raders ages 13-24 due to the subject matter.  Animal Farm is based on animals turning a society that was democratic into a communist one.  The society that was intended to make life easier actually made it a more miserable existance for all.  &quot;All animals that year worked like slaves.&quot;<BR>     Animal Farm deeply dives into the ideals of a society without flaw, and then slowly turns into communism, and a dictatorship.  The writer reveals the irony of the perfect society turning communist brilliantly.  The ideals of the animals change drastically in this book, and it is perfectly boud together so that it will really make you think.<BR>     This book was very well written. It presents a great deal of politics, and the idea of an Utopian Society.  Animal Farm slowly reaveals all the animals ideals turning into the very thing they despised on the first place.<BR>     Young adults will thouroughly enjoy Animal Farm.  It shows that there is no such thing as a perfect society , and there is no point looking for one. All in all thi is one deep book.
B00005UEAR|3.0|As a DT fan this was a must for me, as well as any other future DT album. From previous experiences you just know that DT is incapable of writing a [bad music]. Anyways...since I got this CD I haven't taken out disc #2 from my player, DT did their usual work on that song: complex rhythm and very elaborate harmony, specially at the end of the 4th movement when after a great progression of three augmented chords, the guitar solo resolves into a great acoustic riff on movement #5. Disc #1 is just like Falling into Infinity, with songs that are not really \\"that\\" incredible. In case you're a TRUE DT fan just get the CD, with disc 2 you will be satisfied, but WE all know that Theater has not produced anything close to Images & Words in quite sometime. Enjoy!
B00005UEAR|2.0|First, let me say that I am a DT fan since &quot;Images and Words&quot;.  They are one of the few bands playing that gives me some hope that the industry can recognize talent once in a great while.  Being this is a DT album, I had tremendous expectations when I first started listening to this CD.<br />Unfortunately, history will probably record this effort as their collective low point.  The album is good, but it is not up to DT quality.  Take the first disc and use it as a coaster for your beverage.  Sip on it while you enjoy the second disc.  Not, that it is a masterpeice, either.  The whole album has the feel of a band which came in the studio each morning trying to wing it.  Confident that their sheer technical talent would carry the day.<br />I can only hope that fan comments will force them to go back to the studio to correct this study in mediocrity.  This is the surest way to erode a loyal fan base.  Better luck next time around, guys.  Until then, I'm still a fan.
B00004W5A6|5.0|There is nothing new left to say about SRV. This album shows off the best of SRV. Most albums have tracks which show his talent and tracks which you classify with 'you could have done better'. This album has no such deficiency.
0446677450|5.0|A very good book for those trying to figure out why after many salary increases they have yet to show any assets for them. The mystery is solved in this book. The book does not provide the reader with a detailed map towards financial independence but it does point out why the majority fails to reach that pot of gold.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Like many rock music fans, I often find myself returning continously to my old Stones, Dylan and Neil Young albums when the highly formulaic rock music of today fails to even spark my interest.  Ryan Adams' latest release certainly is a refreshing dose of the folk/rock/country-blend that made Dylan and these other artists so appealing in the first place.  While highly reminiscent of Van Morrison and (especially) Neil Young, as basically every reviewer has pointed out, Adams writes heartfelt, catchy and sometimes moving love songs and effortlessly weaves them into different syles and genres fairly successfully.  While the first track and single \\"New York, New York\\" is an urgent, upeat folk-rock track, it is in no way indicative of the entire 70 minute album.  \\"La Cienega just smiled\\" is laid-back alt country, while \\"The Rescue Blues\\", which to me sounds like a re-write of the Stones' \\"Bedroom Blue\\"s off of Exile, has blantant gospel-blues flourishes.  Perhaps the strangest, and most appealing song, on the album is \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\", featuring Adams singing in a Morrissey-esque croon with a simple arrangement and truly touching lyrics. If you have ever experienced the type of latenight break-up loneliness that he describes so vividly here, you love this song as much as I do.  He picks up the pace a bit with some long, extended guitar jams in \\"Nobody Girl\\", which is followed by a fascinating, abstract character sketch in \\"Sylvia Plath\\".  I am usually exhausted by the time I get to the final six tracks.  I can live without \\"Enemy Fire\\" (track ten), but the energetic \\"Gonna Make you Love Me\\" and the absolutely stunning \\"Wildflowers\\" are true highlights.  \\"Harder Now...\\" is classic Neil vocally and lyrically. It would fit nicely on After the Gold Rush--featuring the fantastic lyric \\"when I threw that drink in that guy's face/it was just to piss you off\\".  Adams' full range of emotions are at the forefront of this album, alternating between bitterness, anger and all-out depression.  I redemptive sense of true love, however, tends to romance the listener out of the dark thematic terrain.  All of the criticisms of this album are fair. It runs a bit long and the influences are fairly direct, almost bordering on Lenny Kravitz-style parody.  But with a certain New York punk band that will remain anonymous (clearly ripping off the Stooges and Lou Reed) garnering huge critical support, I cant understand why Adams' stylistic choices are under such attack. By far, the most interesting and satisfying album I have heard by a newer artist this year. 5 stars.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I cannot imagine how Nicole Kidman was conned into<BR>acting in this absolute farce!  Unless you are in <BR>the 10-14 year old age range, OR you are prepared for a <BR>2 hour movie with the maturity level and plot complexity<BR>of a music video <BR>--- This film is a ***complete*** waste of your time!<br />It is in the same league with Bugs Bunny meets Michael<BR>Jordan and films like that.   Some of the dance sequences <BR>would be more appropriate in a horror movie, or some <BR>wierd sort of a \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\"-esque,<BR>hideous film.<br />Maybe this film was made by someone who absolutely hates<BR>the real Moulin Rouge, and wants everyone else to hate<BR>it as well.<br />I have seen thousands of films, 5% I loved, 90% I <BR>mostly enjoyed.  Only 2 ever got a bad review from me:<BR>Eraserhead and Moulin Rogue.<BR>This film makes me want to vomit!
B000000W5L|5.0|Of all the classic Stones' albums, \\"Exile on Main Street\\" showcases Keith Richards' creativity.  Richards provides memorable guitar hooks (\\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"Happy,\\" \\"Soul Survivor\\"), plays terrific bass (\\"Casino Boogie,\\" \\"Happy,\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\") and even his vocals are above reproach.  \\"Exile\\" was made before too many drugs and cigarettes turned his voice into the raspy croak that one hears on later recordings.  One reason that \\"Exile\\" is predominately his is because most of it was developed and recorded at the villa he was renting in southern France, and Jagger (who had just wed Bianca) was only present periodically.  Mick Taylor and Charlie Watts were around for the most part (Bill Wyman was not) and Richards and Taylor guitar playing meshes better on \\"Exile\\" than any other Stones album.  Gram Parsons was also around at the villa, and his influence, if not his voice (no one can tell from the murky backup vocals) can be heard on \\"Sweet Virginia\\" and \\"Torn and Frayed.\\"<br />The sound quality of the production is cetainly not crystal clear and the lyrics are, to put it mildly, muddled (even for a Stones album), but the energy is incredible.  My personal favorite is \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" which features an incredible steel guitar performance by Al Perkins, permeating a song that resonates with what seems at times resignation to a decadent lifestyle, but also celebration of the creation of music that transcends that lifestyle.  The song captures where the Stones were in 1972:  sinking from all of the excess but still making music that escaped from the destruction.<br />There are many other great moments as well.  \\"Rip This Joint\\" features great piano from the late Nicky Hopkins and a great sax from Bobby Keys.  Richards' bass playing on \\"Casino Boogie\\" is hypnotic and Hopkins shows why he was one of the best rock pianists of the era on \\"Let It Loose.\\"  \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and Richards' \\"Happy\\" are justifiably famous.  Of all the many songs (this was a doublealbum), the only one I really don't care for is \\"Just Wanna See His Face,\\" which probably sounded better when it was recorded, apparently under the influence of some mind-altering substance.<br />My only major complaint concerns the packaging.  If one compares the Rolling Stones' catalog of CD's with those of other major (or even not so major) groups from their era, one has to be disappointed that the Stones' CD's lack liner notes that provide a historical perspective of the particular album and its tracks.  Sony/Columbia has done a wonderful job repackaging the Byrds' albums, providing much new information and including bonus tracks to all their albums.  Same thing with MCA and the Who CD's; \\"Live at Leeds\\" in CD form is far superior to the original vinyl product.  \\"Exile,\\" like the other Stones CD's, comes with reproductions of the original album art and song credits, which were never all that impressive to begin with.  It even has minature photos of the postcards that came with the original vinyl album --- now the totally incoherent commentary on the postcards can be read only with magnification.  One can only hope that someday that the Stones and their management will reissue their works with some written commentary and bonus tracks that will enhance the original product.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I'm glad I don't know Mr. Rickey Wright personally because you must be one grouchy, gloomy guy to be around.  To read some of the negative reviews you'd swear that Dave Matthews had invented the entire jazz/indo/pop sound and that anybody else who sounds even remotely like him (be it in musical style or voice) is just a copy cat.  So I guess Eric Clapton is horrible since he's just playing the blues sound which others played before?  Please.<br />I was VERY impressed when I first heard this album.  I usually don't like mainstream stuff (particularly anything that sounds like it would fit in perfectly on Dawson's Creek.)  But this album is just too good to toss aside simply because it happens to sound somewhat similar to another artist.  I enjoy Dave Matthews Band, but I found this album to be more soothing in a Jimmy Buffett kind of way; very light, easy to listen to, intelligent lyrics, puts you in a good mood.  Good instrumental support, but not overkill like Dave Matthews can sometimes can get.  Give the kid a break.  He's a LOT better than most of the other mainstreamers out there right now.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I'd never seen this before and was totally blown away.  Byrne's spastic movements and the band's faultless musical performance make this an enjoyable show, even if you're not the greatest Talking Heads fan.  Highly recommended!
B00001NFCY|1.0|I don't get it.  I've tried so hard to enjoy this CD, but I just can't ever like it.  The melodies are uninteresting, the vocalist sounds like a bad Eddie Vedder, and the musicians as a whole aren't particularly good.<br />Sure they have a positive message.  So?  Kenny G has a positive message, does that make him worthwhile?<br />I understand many people like, even love, this album.  But I can't understand it.  I always feel like something is just lacking from all of the songs - soul.  This is just too bland for me.
6300215881|2.0|I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I SAW A MOVIE WITH SO MANY GLOWING REVIEWS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE SO DREADFULLY DULL. BRANDO DESERVES PROPS FOR HIS AMBITION. CLEARLY,HE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FILM OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY THE FILM IS SLOW AND THE SCRIPT FORGETTABLE.AND IT'S HARD TO FEEL ANY SYMPATHY OR HATRED TOWARDS BRANDO'S QUIET &quot;RIO&quot;. ONLY CLINT EASTWOOD &amp; CHARLES BRONSON IN SERGIO LEONES &quot;SPAGHETTI WESTERNS&quot; COULD GET AWAY WITH SAYING SO LITTLE IN SUCH A LONG FILM. ALSO, CONTRARY TO WHAT MOST OF THE REVIEWS SAID,THE MOVIE ITSELF BREAKS ONLY A FEW MOLDS THAT WERE TYPICAL OF WESTERN MOVIES. IF YOU WANT TO SEE AN EPIC MOVIE THAT TURNS WESTERN CLICHES ON THEIR HEAD THEN YOU'VE GOT TO SEE &quot;THE GOOD,THE BAD,AND THE UGLY&quot; AND &quot;ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST&quot;.PREFERABLY IN LETTER-BOX EDITION WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE 70mm PANORAMIC CAMERA EMPLOYED TO FULL EFFECT. SOMETHING BRANDO AT THAT TIME CLEARLY COULDN'T DO OR APPRECIATE AS AN ACTOR/DIRECTOR. I'LL TAKE ACTOR/DIRECTOR KEVIN COSTNER'S BEAUTIFULLY FILMED &quot;DANCES WITH WOLVES&quot; OVER THIS ANY DAY.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.  Jack Black and Tenacious D are definitely a beautiful thing. Witty, insightful, sometimes rude but always talented - kinda like Barenaked Ladies with some bite.  This album is mostly some tight, 3-minute songs intermingled with short comedy skits, all from TenD's HBO specials. The humor is definitely dark and twisted, with lots of nasty words and black situations.  I personally love it, and the band certainly shows that they can make some jokes without the nastiness.  One skit has Jack and guitarist KG going through the drive-thru - Jack makes an impossibly long order, then berates KG for taking 30 seconds to order 2 things.  Jack then asks KG to pay for it, and when they don't have enough money, Jack tells them to &quot;cancel the last two things in the order.&quot;  Hilarious.   <br />Yet hiden behind the humor is some outstanding music.  I don't understand what problems people find here - Tenacious D has no problem moving from 80's metal to rock opera to love ballad, all in a single 3 minute song.  Their technique is rock-solid, and their writing is amazing.  One song even had a snip of Bach on the classical guitar!  Jack Black's vocals are crystal clear with an amazing range, almost like Jewel in that JB can twist his voice into sounding like 3-4 different people, and KB can absolutely wail on the guitar, and play any style you can think of.  <br />Most of the songs were produced for Tenacious D's HBO specials, and if you haven't seen them, some jokes won't make as much sense.  For example, the song &quot;Lee&quot; refers to an obsessed fan who hangs out way too often and knows more about the band than they know themselves.  So, they decide to turn the tables on Lee, and start obsessing about HIM, haha.  &quot;Skinny-dipping in a sea of Lee/I proposed on bended knee&quot; is the line that I always lose it on, and the video definitely shows some wackier stuff, liking invading Lee's house at 3am to discuss socks. Checkit out.
6305265488|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I ever saw. It is a classic tale of love that has been used since the time of Cinderella.  I encourage all people to watch this movie so that they san see what real love is.That is my review!
6304913176|5.0|Supremely entertaining sci-fi action film takes place in the future, where Earth lives in a basic fascist society, and is at war with giant insects from a distant planet.  It's up to Casper Van Dien and company to blow as many of them away as possible.  A hilarious \\"character\\" piece in the first half gives way to non-stop action and big, bloody battle scenes in the last hour, some of the best I've ever seen.  Silly, but also exciting, energetic, and just unbelievably entertaining this is director Paul Verhoeven at his best, with standout performances from Clancy Brown and Dina Meyer. Very enthusiastically recommended.<BR>**** 1/2 out of *****
B00005LC1H|5.0|I'm a stickler when it comes to comedy-especially tv comedy. When I saw this series back in the 70's I laughed very hard. Now that it's on DVD complete with all 12 episodes, I put the discs in, kicked back and laughed even harder. It didn't help that I had a slight cold-I could barely breathe and my ribs started hurting after watching the first disc. I then proceeded to watch the other two discs. I was in bad shape by the time I was finished but I didn't care. These old episodes are hilarious. This is the way tv comedy should be!!
B00005RHGK|1.0|I normally love horror movies..good or bad I usually love them all. But this pile of garbage was crap from beginning to end. The first time you heard that song you knew what was coming there were no surprises whatsoever. with an abrupt and rather horrendous and predictable ending the film had little pay off for all its hype. Oh and for more joy why not check out the alternate ending on the DVD. which isn't any better then the original (in fact for those people that don't like the bad guy winning type endings may find it even more depressing. Is that both bro and sis in that scene on the wall?). Try and aviod this film at all Cost, worst Horror film ever made.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I didn't expect too much when I went to see this movie, but came away with renewed respect for Russel Crowe and Ron Howard. I've seen a lot of reviews that call A Beautiful Mind slick & superficial but I don't agree. I found it to be a well-done overview of the life of a brilliant and troubled man. There was enough pathos to give us the feel for it without turning the movie into a dark depiction of mental illness, and enough humor to make John Nash come alive. How can you sum up a man's life in 2 hrs? The only way I know is to pick highlights out of his life and come up with a poignant overview. Ron Howard successfully (in my opinion) does this.<br />By taking us into Nash's delusions it shows us how fine the line can be between reality and fantasy and that no one, despite obvious brilliance, is immune to problems. One of my favorite parts is when Nash is told that he seems haunted by his delusions. He replied that they are in the past and that everyone is haunted by their past. The impact of the past is controlled by how much attention (power) we turn over to them, not their existence in itself.<br />I thought that the entire cast was great and deserving of recognition. If you liked movies such as Moquito Coast, Mr. Holland's Opus, and The English Patient I think that you will like A Beautiful Mind. If you want action, see something else.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie is a wonderful one, full of imagination and possibilities. The online fan-fiction world has taken this to worlds beyond the movie, keeping the 15-year-old movie alive. I myself am an avid viewer of this movie, listening to the songs (my favorite is &quot;Within You&quot;) and watching the amazing scenery. The Goblin King (Jareth)'s songs have hidden meanings in their lyrics, can you figure them out? In short, an imaginative film by the maker of &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; and the Muppet movies that captivates children and thrills adults alike.
B00005B6NC|5.0|In the distant future, a group of passengers-which include a murderous convict and a brave though morally conflicted pilot-aboard a transport ship crashland onto a seemingly uninhabited desert planet. Exploring the region, they discover there are ferocious creatures living under the ground, afraid of the light. The survivors believe they are safe, only to become aware of an approaching solar eclipse! Fast-paced thriller has lots of action, scares, and suspense, boasts very impressive special effects and production values, and features two terrific leads in the sexy Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel. Superb direction from David Twohy solidifies this exemplary sci-fi/horror tale.<BR>**** 1/2 out of *****
B000055X3U|5.0|I have  a fine day to exit as well as all the others, and nothing does it like this album.<br />This is the music I wished they would have kept producing for years and years.<br />One last goodbye took my breath away, and it still does.

B0000542D2|4.0|I thought I knew everything there was to know about this terrific first film from obscure English rock-and-roll combo The Beetles, but this new edition DVD includes bonus features that I never imagined existed. The &quot;easter egg&quot; bonus that allows you to view the movie incorporating the &quot;alternate ending&quot; has to be seen to be believed. (Ringo never does rejoin the group; Paul's grandfather get's him drunk on lagers-and-lime and pushes him into the Thames, where he drowns while experiencing the hallucinations that serve as the basis for the later movie &quot;Yellow Submarine.&quot; Meanwhile, the remaining lads ring up their old drummer Pete Best, who arrives in the nick of time and saves the day, as usual. Why director Lester cut this is a mystery. Best's contributions to the screenplay for this sequence is uncredited, but well-attested to in a surprisingly querulous interview by noted author Albert Goldman.)<br /><br /> This is a movie that really takes you back to the carefree days of 1984. Whatever happened to those Beetle guys, anyway?
0385335482|4.0|Finally a book that's incredibly funny like Bridget Jones's Diary!  It was hilarious, witty and fun-loving.  The only bad thing I can say about it is the sappy ending.  It's hard to believe that Becky finally managed to get her shopping frenzy under control and get her finances straight.  She started becoming a dull character, not the neurotic Becky that she was in the beginning of the book.  But nevermind, it still was an amazing read and I definately recommend it to anyone who loves this type of book!
0783229526|5.0|Terry Gilliam is probaly the finest director we have in cinema today. The films he has made, to name of few; Brazil, Fisher King, Time Bandits, Jabberwocky, and 12 monkeys are all masterpeices in there own right.  And now we come to his latest film \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" The film is excellent in everyway possible. <BR>     <BR>     Right from the opening line \\"We were on the edge of the destert when the drugs began to take hold\\"  we are thrown into the world of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and there is no escape for the next two hours.  Like Hunter S. Thompson said, \\"Buy the ticket take the ride.\\"<br />     It's a nice little DVD.  It's got some great deleted scenes that were cut from the film.  Gilliam says they cut theese because they were to \\"normal\\"  The making of Fear and Loathing is okay, it only runs like 10 minutes, and I think they could have made it 30 minutes.  <br />     I was kind of dissaponited that Gilliam did not do a commentery for this.  He does the best commenteries I beleive, there is never an gaps.  <br />     If your a Gilliam fan get it.  If your a drug fan get it I guess.  And if you don't know great cineama, stay away.
0671578855|5.0|I love to read, but once in a while a book will cause me to read it through in one setting. Not only did I read this book in one setting but within the week, it was re-read 6 more times within the week.&lt;it has been re-read more since.&gt; This book takes your emotions on a rousing roller coaster ride. Lois McMaster Bujold outdid herself on this &quot;campaign&quot; (I have all her books). The various plots kept you thinking &quot;what else can happen now?&quot; While the dinner was &quot;delicious&quot; in a mini-denouement, my vote went to goes to the voting of the counts chapter as one of the great denouements.&lt;love re-reading this chapter.&gt; I love Miles' adventures and he certainly gets into some sticky ones. He lives up to the adage that it is better to be lucky than good. Rousing story! My hat is off to Ms Bujold.
0800177975|4.0|With its super-over-the-top take-offs of the most hackneyed action flick cliches ever seen on the silver screen, 'Last Action Hero' is one of the most enjoyable cheeseball classics I've ever experienced. Sure, it has the reputation of being a bad film, but it's bad in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way. Ah-nold's physical presence and delightfully deep-toned & accented banter really adds a great deal of... um... well, pretty much the same things to this flick as it has all the other actioners he's ever been in. And, like other flicks that feature a prepubescent kid, budding thespian Austin O'Brien gives this baby that tried-and-true aw-shucks-isn't-he-just-keeyoot factor that adds to both the hokey fun AND the nausea! The on-screen chemistry between him and Arnold is part 'Laurel & Hardy', and part Riggs-and-Murtaugh. Well, actually it's more part Abbott & Costello, and part 'Tango & Cash'... um, no that's not quite right, either. Well, let's just say it's a much better team-up than Sylvester Stallone & Estelle Getty ('Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot'). Come to think of it, what action-comedy team-up ISN'T better than that?<br />But I digress. If you're looking for a not-half-bad action/comedy flick that possesses plenty of super-hokey megacheese moments, and will leave you both entertained and mortified that you were entertained by it, 'Last Action Hero' just might be the movie you've been looking for!<br />'Late

0451169514|1.0|Ok, there's one thing about Stephen King books that I've always tried to ignore, but this book... [made me way too angry]. This guy really is terrible at writing women. In King's books women are always 1)rescued by the man, 2)protected by the man, 3)whiny and irritating, 4)treated like dirt by the man, 5)of subnormal intelligence. Men always think of women in a condescending way in these books. I'm not a radical feminist, but I'm an independent girl who can defend herself and it annoys me that there are no female characters that I can relate to in any way. This book has one female character whose main purpose is to have sex with the six guys. Come on, Stephen, get with the times.
B000002H33|5.0|I love this disc.  Each time I listren to it I find a new part of a song that I never really noticed before.  I have the Black Album, but its not comparable to this.  The best songs are the first 6.  Here's the song by song analysis:<br />1) Battery: great, headbanging song, not too musically rich, but awesome for those times when your angry.  4 stars.<br />2) master of puppets: great song, a bit long, there's an acoustic part in the middle that i dont like too much. 5 stars<br />3) the thing that should nto be: not too heavy, but still great. very catchy vocals.  5 stars<br />4) Sanitarium: my personal favorite-like track 3 not too heavy, but musically rich. 5 stars<br />5) Disposable Heroes: the heaviest, thrashiest song on the album.  long, angry and awesome. great antiwar song too. 5 stars.<br />6) leper messiah: another, heavy awesome song.  not very fast but great lyrically.  its about a crooked religious prophet. 5 stars.<br />7) Orion: an instrumental, some great guitar, but otherwise, nothing amazing. 3.5 stars<br />8) Damage Inc.: similar to the first song, but not as good.  A good song but not comparabelt o the rest of the album. 3.5 stars
0553106635|3.0|All the praise heaped on the first two books is well deserved. They are wonderful, and I would recommend them to anyone who has a taste for anything remotely like fantasy fiction. I couldn't wait to get this third book, but after reading it, feel that it didn't live up to the promise of the first two. I agree with the reviewer from New Zealand; it seems almost as though Mr. Martin lost his way... Still, the series as a whole is a great accomplishment, and I would go so far as to say that the first two books set a new standard for the genre.
B00005YTFG|4.0|I loved Moulin Rouge! it has a great plotline. Christian a writer goes to France to well...write. There he agrees to write the script for a play Spetacular Spectacular.  They play is going to be preformed at the Moulin Rouge.  There he meets Satine, The Sparklind Diamond of the Moulin rouge.  They fall in love but hve to hide it because she is the star of the Moulin Rouge and the Duke, blackmails Harold, the owner to sign an agreement so literally he \\"oens Satine.  The movie has a lot of great music and dancing.  It certaintly deserved all the awards it got!  It was kind of weird at times (like when Christian and his friends get drunk so they see a fairy) but it was honestly great!
B000001IQH|5.0|I have all Rancid cds and I can say they are really GREAT punk albums, but I think this is the BEST!<BR>This album is so energic and has catchy songs in a pure punk-style with interesting lyrics; 19 songs and you won't be disappointed in any of them.<br />THIS is punk! Forgot Blink 182, that in my opinion is more rock than punk (ehy, don't get me wrong, I have some Blink's albums and they are... nice, but I prefer Rancid, NOFX, AFI, etc.... and by the way, my fav band is The Offspring...) <br />My fav tracks:  the 11th hour  -- roots radicals -- time bomb -- ruby soho -- journey to the end... -- disorder and disarray -- the wars end.<br />P.s.: if you like this cd you must also buy Lars and Tim work \\"Lars Frederiksen & the Bastards\\"... another great punk album...<br />(ehm... sorry for my horrible english... ;-)

Its a simple story, thats flipped upside down, and uses ingenious tricks to make the audience feel and think things we normally do not. Mr. Lynch is an incredible talent, as much as he and this film are so anti-hollywood, even the suits on top acknowledged his brilliance with an Oscar Best Director nomination. Pictures that use all this symbolism are rare in film today.  <br />With those ideas out of the way, this film is completely subjective. You only get out of it, the brain power that you put into it, to understand what you see on screen. Its a really funny film because all of the performances are a bit over-dramatized to further satire his views of hollywood and would be new comers. Lynch's ability to make the most common scenes very tense, such as the \\"expresso scene\\" or the \\"Silencio Club\\" scene. Everytime I watch this movie I get something completely new out of it. Dont' try to wreck your brain to understand EVERY SINGLE part, but enjoy what they do to you. Wether it's make you laugh, feel tense, or confused. Confusion is underated in our society. We give it such a negative conotation. Confusion allows us to think critically and make amazing discoveries about this world and ourselves.<br />The film satires everything you ever thought about L.A. Naomi Watts is brilliant in her transformation from beginning to end. The film is not just art for art's sake, it is a very coherant plot once you see it a few dozen times and think about what everything means. This is a very rewarding film to watch, but not for your average movie goer. <BR>If you're not ready to  think, then skip this movie.
0783222955|5.0|It is rare that a book capture the hearts and minds of those who read it and becom what is considered an American Classic.  It is even rarer when said book is succesfully transformed to a movie.<br />Gregory Peck gives a wonderful portrail as Atticus Finch, the single father of two children in the Depression Era south.  While the story revolves primarily around the lives of his two kids, Jem and Scout, it also centers on Atticus' involvement in the trial of a poor black man who is accussed of raping an even poorer white woman.<br />This is a great movie and a must watch for anyone who wants to watch brilliant acting and brilliant characters.
0805047905|5.0|My brother picked this book out for my little girl's 1 birthday.  It has helped her to identify animals and colors at such a young age.  It is so cute to watch her babble words as if she is really reading.  When we read it to her she helps turn pages and gets very excited when she sees the \\"yellow duck\\".  She has a lot of books but that is the one that is most interesting to her!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Buy it today! It's a great movie and an even better DVD.  It has two discs filled with extras. Don't miss out on this one.  It'll make a great addition to your DVD library.  The performances are top notch and believable.  The music is catchy and fun.  The director is one of the best directors in Hollywood. The story is trite but with the new twist it makes it exciting, and the pace is upbeat, fast and a thrilling ride. I highly recommend!
B00005YTFG|5.0|I'm not one to go for the hype of a movie, so it was to my great suprise how much I LOVED this movie.  I never saw it in the theatre, but rented it one day.  I started watching it and it took awhile, but it grabbed me, and did not let go for the entire movie.<BR>Nicole Kidman is wonderful, and a very good singer.  Her acting in this movie is as good as any Oscar winning performance I have ever seen.  I hope my husband doesn't see this, but I am so in love with Ewan McGregor now it's a little silly.  He also is great in this movie and is so attractive and sexy, it's a bit unfair.<BR>I hope everyone gives this movie a chance!<BR>P.S. Baz Lurhmann was truely robbed by not being nominated for this film
B00005R87Q|4.0|This movie has a bad plot, but it was still great!  The cars and racing scenes were sweet, just the story line wasn't all that good.  This is a movie for people who like action movies or cars.  Pretty good acting too.
B000050XEI|5.0|I will admit i was never a big fan of new age music, then i heard Enya and have been buying her music for years.&quot;A day without rain has to be her best yet.I get home from work and put it in, have a glass of wine, and there is nothing more relaxing and stress relieving.Enya's style of music and instumental sounds put you in another world and lifts your spirits to another level. I would highly recommend this cd to the new age fans.
B00005UKKF|2.0|I usually love HBO concerts and I did enjoy parts of Britney's Vegas concert because some of the songs had great choreographed performances. The choreographer did a good job, but that doesn't say much about Britney.  She has great stage presence and is very appealing on the eyes but it was very dissapointing to listen to a pre-recorded track. I thought Britney LIVE meant we would actually hear her singing LIVE but that wasn't the case, and it really took a toll on the quality of the show.
B000003NA4|4.0|I enjoy listening to this CD in the late hours when burning the midnight oil. The selection of romantic songs make for a quiet and introspective set compared to the bouncy uptempo songs on All For You. Ms. Krall's voice is in fine form with an understated reading of the lyrics.<br />At first listening (on an erratic portable CD player), I thought the sound level was uneven on this CD, but after careful listening, the recording is excellent, if not exactly the same as All For You.
B00005JKQX|5.0|From the heights of notoriety to the depths of depravity, John Forbes Nash, Jr. (Russell Crowe) experienced it all. A mathematical genius, he made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery. After many years of struggle, he eventually triumphed over this tragedy, and finally-late in life-received the Nobel Prize.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie is BORING. The story is trite and the movie should have ended atleast half an hour before it did.  The DVD isn't worth it because the movie sucked. PASS on it.  It's just not worth the money or the time. The only redeeming factor was the brilliant acting of Haley.  He is a natural, but it can't make up for a bad script, 1-dimensional characters, and choppy pacing.
B00000JRTX|3.0|This movie raised Hugh Grant to stardom, at least in North America'; watching his performance, it's easy to see why.  He's his typical likeable self - self-effacing, witty, bashful, and fun, all at the same time.  It's a little more difficult to see why this film was nominated for best picture - it's only a good, not a great, movie.  There are parts that are brilliant, but something is missing to tie the pieces together.<br />Most glaring is the existence and motivation for Andie McDowell's character - why is she at these weddings?  She can jets an incredible distance to come, yet seems to be unknown and is ignored by the wedding guests.  It doesn't help that the character itself is two-dimensional and acts solely at the whim of the screenplay.  Grant is left alone to carry the narrative forward on his own, but this time has virtually no help from the supporting characters, each of which has too little screen time to develop any personality.  The inevitable comparison to the more recent &quot;Notting Hill&quot; hurts 4 Weddings.  &quot;Hill&quot; has fewer characters, but they are better developed (and likeable), much to its advantage.<br />Having said that, Grant's performance alone is worth the price of admission, and there are some good laughs.  The DVD itself is terrible - the picture and sound are fine, but there are no extras whatsoever.  Surely a film that was nominated for best picture (and one for which Grant won a Golden Globe) deserves better treatment than this.
0064407667|5.0|origoinally i scorned this book- what was this new shiny addition to my neighborhood bookstore and why does the back suggest i dont read it? either way i wasnt going to i was going to ignore it and read my other books that didnt need to rely on flashy illustrations and fancy hardcovers. needless to say i read it. my mom once made a deal with me that she would buy any book i wanted as long as i would finish it- that was her first mistake her second was actually living up to her promise but this a bad begining was pushing my familys tight budget with its heafty price tag- so i was going to follow the authors advice and not read this tale of woe. then one day i had made an extra ten dollars so i bought it and from the second i opened it to the moment i finished it- this was one of the best books i have ever read. it was new- refreshing- it was amazing so i read the entire series in almost a week, the writing is fantastic and the illustrations are perfectly melded with the story line not to mention utterly amazing themseves so was this book worth my hard earned money and did i change my view of mister lemony snickett- the answer would have to be yes. anyways read the book its great for anyone (im 15) and it is worth it. maybe i should quit judging books by the cover.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is amazing.  The editing style alone gives it 5 stars but also, the unique story and wonderful script make this film one of the best in the year 2001. The non-linear delivery of the story was well-done and Guy Pierce does a great job playing the lead character.  Don't miss this film. I highly recommend!
B00005R87Q|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, I was told &quot;it's just another 'guy' flick&quot; and advised not to go see it. Well, I ignored that advice and I'm darn glad I did cos it's a great movie! Although the plot is a little weak, the strong cast holds it together and makes it a movie worth watching. Brian is instantly suspicious and the explaination for his behaviour is no big surprise. What is a shock is who is behind the truck robberies; although the suspicion is there the film makers throw the viewer a few red herrings to throw you off the scent. The two female leads are so vastly different that complement each other perfectly and the &quot;team&quot; is so diverse that you never quite know where they're coming from. A bunch of nice cars, and nice bikes, adds the finishing touch to an intimate look at the illegal street racing scene of today's American youth.<br />If you're not sure rent the movie rather than buying it but WATCH IT as it's a great movie with a wondferful cast.<br />And there's always Vin Diesel with his shirt off for the ladies to look at ;-&gt;
6305603847|5.0|This edition of Pink Floyd - The Wall contains a saucerful of secrets (not to be confused with &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;), tons of extra materials and, of course, the music, the madness and the movie.<br />Image quality and sound quality are superb. Definitely worth every penny.
0792842723|5.0|This is a film about two men, 006 and 007 who grew up as children and were recruited to work for their country. Its the story of James Bond, and of Alec Trevelyan, played by Pierce Brosnan. Sean Bean has a death that is \\"stagd\\" in the beginning of the film, and his death haunts James Bond for over ten yars, and then he is given the chance to go after the general that killed his best friend, only to have a surprise middle of the film and the resurrection of Alec. He is totally converted by the Russians, sarcastically renounces his citizenship and his affiliation as a friend and a co-worker with James,and wants to use GoldenEye to do damage to London. He is brash, rude, methodical to the point that he can put a gun together and do it with hardly any effort. Its a terrorist role, and its one that Sean Bean does very well. Don't miss the two boys with toys 006 and 007!
630281474X|5.0|This is one of the best Dracula films ever created.Being one of the best Hammer Films,this movie offers gore,horror and beautiful young vixens in this horror thriller.<BR>Also adding to the horror is Christopher Lee who plays the king of all vampires,Count Dracula.And we can't forget Van Helsing played by Peter Cushing,who also makes the movie work.Without these two characters this movie would stink!<br />This is a movie that will please horror fans,Dracula fans or you just want a good scream.<br />THIS FILM IS WORTH WATCHING AND ALSO WORTH THE MONEY!
0380788624|5.0|Over the summer, I made this the first book I've read for pleasure in almost a year.  It took 2 weeks to get through the massive tome, but I noticed that I was sneaking away to it everytime I got a free minute.<BR>Other reviewers can comment on the historical/technical accuracy; what struck me most were the vivid, cinematic descriptions.  If you find the time, and enjoy techno-centric novels, you will enjoy this book.
B00005R23X|5.0|This is one of the most stunning,seductive,and scary horror films of all time.This DVD(or video)will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits at the end!<br />But I think that the Superbit and the ordinary Dvd release are the same.But it is up to you if you want to pay more.<br />Bram Stoker's Dracula is director Francis Ford Coppola's epic retelling of a story that has inspired many films-but never one so true to Stoker's 1897 novel and its historical background.<br />This is a great horror.This is Dracula as you never seen him before.Once you have seen Bram Stoker's Dracula you will never forget it.<br />*RATED R FOR VAMPIRE VIOLENCE,GORE,STRONG SEXUAL CONTENT,and NUDITY.
B00004XONN|5.0|I really do not know how you could go wrong with any Radiohead CD purchase.  I think Kid A would be considered one of my favorites.  Kid A has some cool sounds and beats that are a little different from past albums.  If you like this album buy Amnesiac and the live album.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is a GREAT soundtrack, one of the best. I listen to it when I'm reading the books (Lord of the Rings). It makes my imagination a lot more stronger,and I can picture the characters and the scenes from the movie while I'm reading. And I absolutely love the last song that Enya sings (May it Be), I've got a few of her CDs and I also listen to them when I'm reading. It blends just as well in Middle Earth. She has got an incredible voice, as fair as an elf:) It's amazing how real your imagination can seem.<br />I think, when the DVD comes out (and hopefuly quick), instead of having a choice to watch it in the subtiles French and Spanish, they should have a choice in Gaelic or even Elvish:)I would love to watch it in those languages. I probably wouldn't care if I didn't understand what they were saying.
B0000508U6|4.0|It a nice change from popular music.  The whole CD is slower and not like anything you hear on the radio.  Very relaxing.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Hey, i am eddie ducrest and i am 15 years old, i recently was digging through some old movies and came upon one i had seen wen i was really young, i was bored, so i popped it in the old vhs player and let it rip, IT TOTALLY BLEW ME AWAY, i coudlnt beleive it, the music was awsome, the characters cracked me up. I havent seen a better movie since. There is just something magical about it. I think since it was disneys last movie it will live on forever. My favorite charictor i would have to say would be King Louis, the monkey king. The story has a little something for everyone, it always makes me laugh when i watch it, and i always sing along. I would have given this movie more than five stars but it wasnt an option, i would give this movie Infinate stars. i would like to thank walt disney, and everyone else who helped create this wonderfull maserpeice.
B000002UY5|4.0|Great, great, great!!!!  I love this album so much.  Each song has the ability to stand alone in a crowd, which is a priceless asset.  I think what got me the most was how well put together the album is.  It flows like water from a river, to a babbling brook, to a quiet lake, back to a river... the sound is so inviting.  I didn't have to hit the \\"forward\\" button even once!!  Only two other bands can do that with an album, as far as I'm concerned - and that says alot about Blind Melon and the late Shannon Hoon's talents.  Pick this one up, you will not regret it!!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|....vh rules
B000000OSG|3.0|I completely agree with a review previously written ... - had the two \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums been combined and shaken down leaving the more solid material, it would have been one of the greatest albums of all time.  Some of the less enjoyable songs could have gone on The Spaghetti Incident? for sure.  I wouldn't have missed them.  Don't get me wrong, Guns has great songwriting skill, as seen with \\"Estranged,\\" (possibly one of the greatest songs, in my opinion) but it really lacked a sense of continuity and it seemed like the songs were all thrown together in a haphazard way.  Slash's undeniable talent stands out, as always, but it's definitely not enough to support an entire album.  Bottom line:  right songs, wrong albums.
0471413909|5.0|I would like to write this review for 2 reasons:<br />1)I just want to say that I first started to lose weight when I switched to a low-carb diet, but continued to eat lots of dairy and soy, as I was a vegetarian. I have always been a size 12-14, and was quite pleased when I dropped to a size 10 by eliminating bread, pasta and sugar from my diet. I still experienced occasional fatigue and lots of digestive upset, though, and it wasn't until I took an allergy test and found I was allergic to grains and dairy - and subsequently cut both completely out of my diet - that I started to feel the energy and vitality for which I have been searching for years. I'm also allergic to most beans, so my only alternative source of protein was meat. I started to eat lean, unprocessed meats and fresh fruits and veggies, and my energy was not only soaring, but my depression lifted, my skin became smoother and softer, and I dropped down to a size 4 without even trying to lose weight! (I've never been less than a size 10 in my life!) Anyways, I effortlessly maintained that level of vitality and a size 4 until I started to eat rice flour, oats, processed meats and candy. I quickly gained 15lbs and fell into depression once again, leading me to realize that once on a paleo diet, it must become a way of life. The foods that Dr.Cordain describes as detrimental to our health (grains, dairy, legumes) are indeed factors in all sorts of health problems. If you are a possible buyer of this book, please take note of this, you cannot expect to lose weight and then go back to your usual style of eating. Buy this book and undertake Dr.Cordain's suggestions only if you are ready to change your lifestyle - it will be well worth it, I promise! In any case, I have since started back on the paleo-lifestyle route (feeling better already and have lost 5lbs in one week), with the help of Lauren Cordain's book, and it has been an invaluable resource for me. I have beeen waiting for him to write a book for awhile now, as I have been reading interviews and papers written by him on [...] since I first started on the paleo nutrition route 2 years ago. This brings me to my second point in writing this review:<br />2)In response to the reviews that mention disdain at the apparent contradiction with Dr.Cordain discouraging the use of saturated fat while promoting the idea that humans' natural diet contained lots of meat, known to be rich in saturated fats, I have read research that sheds some light on this, at least for me. It seems that the saturated fat found in lean game meat - buffalo or wild boar that has been running around the jungle or the plains all day - has a different composition entirely than the saturated fat found in your average piece of supermarket meat - cows, chickens, even free-range game. There is a more favorable ratio of omega 3:omega 6 fatty acids in the lean game meat, as well as other aspects that I can't remember offhand, but you can read more for yourself on this subject in interviews of Dr.Cordain on beyondveg's website.<br />One more note for those of you trying to decide between Dr.Atkins or something similar, or a book such as this one or Neanderthin: speaking from the point of view of a person who has developed IBS and multiple food allergies as a result of the Standard American Diet, I wholeheartedly agree with the low-carb way of life, but must offer my 2cents that any diet that fails to caution the consumer on the downfalls of consuming fake foods such as artificial sweetners and salty, processed meats, cannot be healthy for the long-term. I would eat fresh cream or whole milk before I put MSG, nitrates, sulfites or Splenda into my body. I have tried Atkins, and I felt a big difference in my general health from that program to one of eating more natural foods as advocated by Dr.Cordain, Diana Schwarzbein and Ray Audette.<br />If you are undecided, please take your long-term health as well as your short-trem weight into consideration. Any of the above-mentioned authors can help you lose weight and feel great, but unlike Atkins or Eades, they will help you do it for life. As far as deciding between the above-mentioned authors, \\"The Paleo Diet\\" is written by a well-respected professor and expert in the field of paleolithic nutrition, and if you were to go with one book on low-carbing, this would probably the healthiest, most sane and moderate approach I have seen out there.
0671721720|4.0|Solid follow up to On Basilisk Station. Fleshes out Honor. Yes, she is too good to be true sometimes, but that's part of what makes the novels fun.
0792162803|4.0|First off, this movie is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's bad, and I liked it, and I refuse to apologize for that.<br />Technically, it's bad for the standard reasons: unrealistic acting, pretty predictable plot, yedda yedda. It's good because, to my mind, the cast and crew knew of the weaknesses and decided to hold up a mirror to teenage ostracism and oddities within that framework.<br />I first saw this film while eating at a restaurant: it came on TV, and the only reason I left is because I was on my lunch break and had to get back to work. I was spellbound. For all this movies faults, Molly Shannon knew what she was doing. She made such a ridiculously lame and pathetic character that pretty much anyone could laugh at her, and yet took pretty much every piece of embarassment and paranoia regarding teen years and trying to fit in, stuffed them into this movie and also made a character who I could sympathize with while thinking, \\"well, at least I wasn't _that_ bad.\\"<br />A friend of mine actually gave me kudos for being able to sit through this movie for those very reason. She just *won't*, for fear that she'd die of embarassment if she did. And yet, there's a feeling of \\"and guess what: you got through that part of your life anyway, didn't you?\\" towards the end of the movie that makes the whole ordeal worthwhile.<br />That's what this is: an ordeal film. It's likable without being, well, artistically good, but you've got to have the stomach for seeing little echos of a nerdy past in it. I guess it's also good therapy: if you can forgive Mary Katherine Gallagher for being the way she is, you can certainly forgive yourself for being a social misfit.
0671319809|4.0|Like Field of Dishonor, the longish sequences of depression can get tedious. Still a good read overall.
B00005MP58|5.0|I started to watch this a couple of months ago on A&E but because it aired on consecutive nights and I would have missed the second part I didn't watch it. Last month I purchased this film from Amazon and have no complaints the DVD horror stories read elsewhere do not apply to this DVD. I could go on and on about the quality of this film and the cast (the main characters are excellent.) But to me the supporting cast steals the show from the dippy younger sister that runs away and causes so much trouble. To the absolutely dead on believable performance of Mrs Bennett, I can tell you many times over the course of this film I wished I could have reached through the screen and chicken-choked that woman. Viewing quality work such as this, will have you considering \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\" among others. Well worth the cost.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The movie was a good movie. I am listening to the book on tape and have relazed more mistakes for example when they take  harry potter to oliver wood. In the book he was in flickricks room nots defence against the dark arts. So they're are tiny mistakes and major mistakes. But over all it was a good movie.
0783226063|3.0|Well, The original *UNCUT* movie is worth 5 stars. I was very dissapointed to find a few important scense cut from this DVD. Surly they could easly included them.<br />On a positive side, the wide screen format was super.

0790744473|4.0|BRIGADOON is a charming less well-known Lerner and Loewe musical about two Americans on a hunting trip in Scotland. The two yanks get lost looking for birds in the Highlands and happen upon the quaint little village of Brigadoon, a town that appears not to have changed for hundreds of years. Gene Kelly stars as Tommy, the American who falls for the beautiful bonny lass, Fiona (Cyd Charisse). The film is full of wonderful dance numbers revolving around these two; after all they were two of America's finest dancers. Van Johnson also stars as Tommy's comical best friend, Jack. Johnson steals just about every scene he's end and that's without doing much dancing. The theme of the show is that love can conquer all, even in an enchanted place such as Brigadoon. Until another time and another place.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I've had this album for about 3 months and each time i listen to it,it just gets better you can see why it is a million selling album i'd never heard of Creed until i saw the video for Eyes Wide Open on MTV.I just had to have it,i've got the UK edition as i'm from the UK which has the bonus of the strings version of Eyes Wide Open plus the videos of Eyes Wide Open and Higher.This has erged me to pursue the next album and i hope it is just as good if not better. This band bring back memories of when Pearl Jam hit the scene with their debut album TEN.I wish these guys all the succsess with their new album. But this album is a valuble asset to any collection.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was very reluctant to see this film, primarily because so many people had so many negative things to say about it. But see it I did. And I was astounded at just how good it was. What I find incredible is that the always-frosty Nicole Kidman has garnered all the accolades while precious little has been said about Ewan McGregor. Yet it is McGregor who is the very soul of this film; it is his heartfelt performance that gives the film its depth. On top of that, he can actually sing, and with, again, great feeling.<br />The blending of original tunes written especially for the film (and, shockingly, not nominated for an Academy Award for best song) and previously recorded songs is very powerful--none moreso than the Sting tune, Roxanne, intercut with another number performed as an exquisitely danced, emotionally fraught tango. <br />Director Luhrmann knows his territory and covers it very well indeed. The dance sequences are frantic, even mad; the sets and costumes are brilliant--both in conception and in color. This is a film that fills the senses; there is so much going on, even in the quieter scenes, that it warrants being viewed several times.<br />Particularly powerful is McGregor's climactic scene with the dying Kidman. Here is an actor who endows even the rather asexual Kidman with his own heat.<br />There are a lot of reviews posted with declarations of dislike for this movie. I suspect they were written by people who were expecting to see something like a 1950's MGM musical. Moulin Rouge is a musical for now; a rendering of a classic tale done by the likes of Puccini and Verdi--all variations on La Dame aux Camellias--the naive young man who falls in love with a courtesan only to lose her to consumption.<br />This is very worth seeing. Approached with an open mind, it's a feast for the senses. Highly recommended.
0156012197|5.0|. . .and extremely profound for \\"grown-ups\\" as well.<br />Antoine De Saint-Exupery's timeless classic \\"The Little Prince\\" should be on the shelf of every child -- especially the homeschooled child -- in America.  It teaches love, friendship, commitment, perseverence, etc. all with a wonderful dose of humor aided by the rich illustrations of the author.<br />The book is also useful for teaching children about the very real evils in the world:  greed, hate, fear, etc.  It also explores death in a serious yet incredibly tender way.  Parents, get this book and read it with your children.  You will never be sorry you did so.<br />(As a matter of personal preference, I prefer the older English-language translation to the recent re-do -- but that is a minor point.)<br />It is interesting to note that not long after writing this book, De Saint-Exupery was himself lost in a plane over the Sahara.  Neither he nor his plane were ever recovered.
6305648522|5.0|This is one of my top five favorite films of all time. A movie about movies, with wonderful characters, and an extraordinary soundtrack by the gifted Ennio Morricone (also one of my all-time favorite soundtracks.) The music is so well integrated that it becomes a character part in the film. The little boy who falls in love with movies (a splendid performance by the young Salvatore Cascio) and spends his every free moment in the projection booth with the crusty old projectionist (played beautifully by the fine French actor, Philippe Noiret) grows up to be a successful director. The film never falls into the trap of mawkish sentimentality but is true to life and bittersweet--entirely deserving of its Academy Award for best foreign film. Not to be missed!
B00005TT77|4.0|...but couldn't help giving the CD a spin at one of the local book store's listening stations. I haven't yet been able to bring myself to see the movie, what with my perception that Sean Penn's simply taking a ... shot at his very own Rain Man/Forest Gump academy award. That said, the CD was the most pleasant musical surprise this month. Wonderful. Aimee Mann, Eddie Vetter, Sheryl Crow and others pay admirable tribute to some of the best music ever created by the human race. It's not 100%--such a compilation couldn't possibly receive top marks from everyone, everywhere, everywhen. But it's a strong 95%. Most impressive was Chocalate Genius' \\"Julia\\"...MUCH different arrangement than the original, but (Man, I'm gonna get heat for this)in many ways better--Even John would like it, I'm sure. :) If you're a Beatles fan at any level, this CD is a must. Even if you're not, give it a listen. Hopefully, you'll be as positively surprised as I am (not Sam).
B00005V4O5|5.0|Along with many others, I was disappointed to learn that Pain of Salvation's fourth album would not be the continuation of The Perfect Element story, which began with part I in 2000. Instead, we get Remedy Lane, a stunningly powerful and convoluted semi-story that is emotionally fatiguing in its intense pathos. Pain of Salvation has crafted a masterpiece here, perhaps one greater than The Perfect Element Part I. The band's original music and emotional performances are more powerful than ever. I'm not making any real objective statement here...it's just that I feel more drawn to this album than any of the band's previous works (which are all good, if not great).<br />Remedy Lane is another theme album (like One Hour by the Concrete Lake), this time about various forms of reconciliation. There is a roughly defined story, but it is fairly disjointed and the album mainly deals with different issues tied to the theme. Mainly it seems to cover the challenges of relationships and the connection between love and sex (you can have sex without love, and love without sex). It touches on tragedies like a miscarriage (\\"A Trace of Blood\\"), attempted suicide (\\"Rope Ends\\"), and a simple broken heart (\\"Second Love\\"). It's not all sad, though. There's some happier subjects like simple romance (\\"This Heart of Mine\\") and an obscure hint in the dark \\"Beyond the Pale\\" that two people can make each other better.<br />I am in the minority that thinks Gildenlow is not an amazing vocalist, but his performance on this album _is_ amazing. Mainly, this is because he no longer mistakes melissima for emotion, which always annoyed me before (I know I know...I'm demented). He conveys much less melodrama through his singing on this album, which really makes the emotions sound more natural and convincing, as if Gildenlow has improved as an \\"actor.\\" He just gets better and better: the barely controlled pain of \\"Undertow\\"; the vicarious hopelessness of \\"Rope Ends\\"; the heartbreaking \\"A Trace of Blood\\". Since the emotional power of Pain of Salvation's music is so very closely tied to Gildenlow's singing, this improvement is critically important.<br />Just like always, Pain of Salvation's unique brand of music is refreshingly...fresh! \\"Fandango\\" weaves staccato guitar, bass lines and eddying pianos through odd patterns. \\"A Trace of Blood\\" is a fast, powerful mix of twisting piano run, heavy riffing, strange vocal accents, scratching guitar (?) effects, and tragic chorus. Eight-minute songs don't usually go by so fast. \\"Rope Ends\\" works heavy guitars through hypnotizing time signatures without being awkwardly technical. \\"Undertow\\" is initially understated sonically with a weird recording technique -- almost sounds like they put the microphones in the opposite end of the room or something. It erupts into a crippling outburst of emotional power (isolated and captured by vocals & instruments), suggesting suppressed emotions breaking free. \\"Remedy Lane\\" is a quick instrumental that reintegrates themes from previous songs with unusual keyboard effects. \\"Chain Sling\\" features melodies based on Swedish folk music (actually, that seems trendy these days). \\"Beyond the Pale\\" is the engaging finale, deceptively simple at face value but very involved texturally, with complex melody shifts. Unfortunately, I don't think this song ends the album with the powerful finale it deserves.<br />And even when the songs are \\"normal\\" they remain strong, showing that the band can tackle any format. \\"Second Love\\" is an understated, melancholic acoustic/electric mix, with Gildenlow's pained vocals rousing an image of a lonely night under the stars. The lyrics smell like an 80s love ballad, but it works, you know? (Interestingly, the song was written about 15 years ago, so it _was_ an 80s love ballad, hehe.) Another ballad, \\"This Heart of Mine\\", stands out with its powerful middle section and affectionate chord structures. \\"Dryad of the Woods\\" is a beautiful instrumental with pastoral acousticguitar melodies befitting the title. I love the piano melody on this one, heh. What can I say? I'm a sucker for nice little piano bits.<br />Even the recording quality is great...there's none of that grievous lack of clarity that impaired some of the heavily textured sections on The Perfect Element Part I. There's a lot going on in Remedy Lane's songs, but you can hear everything. Plus, you can gain appreciation for a whole new level of nuance in this recording through headphones. Even the booklet for this album is great, with elaborate artwork and twisted imagery.<br />Remedy Lane is another album that captures Pain of Salvation's creative magic. The band's fans are pretty energetic, so most of them have probably bought this disc by now. If not, well, they'd better have a good reason not to have it! If you happen to be a prospective fan, I strongly recommend you check this out no matter what your tastes are. Take a walk down Remedy Lane.<br />Now how about The Perfect Element Part II, huh?

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I rented this movie not knowing what I would be in for.  I read the back of the cover and it seemed interesting.  When I watched it I was amazed to say the least.  <BR>   It is a film about a mother obsessed with TV and she then gets a opportunity to be on TV.  So she wants to wear this red dress when she is a contestant on television.  However, the dress no longer fit her, like it once did.  So she takes a diet and is unhappy with it.  Then she goes to a doctor to get pills but before she knows it she is addicted with them.  Also, it is about her son and son's friend who are drug addicts and drug dealers.  Lastly, there is the son's girlfriend who is a drug addict and slowly becoming a prostitute.<BR>    The movie is really real.  People actually do go through these situations which makes this film so depressing and haunting.  It will stick with you for a very, very long time.  Be warned that it is tough to watch however.  <BR>Content<BR>Violence: 5/10 (gun shooting, arm gets amputated, and drug related violence.)<BR>Sex:  10/10  (Graphic sex scene, prostitution, 1 disturbing and graphic scene of prostituting.)
6305499365|5.0|This is a great movie that most of us can relate to.  BUT I WARN YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH WHAT THE GUY IN THE MOVIE DOES (quit his job and stop paying bills) it doesn't actually work like it does in the movies.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first heard John on the Serendipity soundtrack.  It was one of the songs that I enjoyed the most, but I did not think much of it.  Then, I started to hear his latest on the radio.  I realized that I recognized the voice and that I enjoyed the song.  So, I thought I'd try the CD.  I instantly fell in love with it.  John has a great singer/songwriter style.  Each piece tells a story.  I feel like I connect with his feelings and that I have a sense of who he is.  He clearly loves his music and it is reflected in his music.  I've had this CD for two months now and it still occupies the number one slot in my player.
B000002BPS|5.0|I had bought this CD after only having Americana, which I think is a good CD despite what everybody else says. After listening to the beginnings of the songs, I thought I had wasted my money, but I had taken a risk in buying it so I listened to each song all the way through. And let me tell you, I'm glad I did. This CD is jam packed with the Offspring we knew before their \\"makeover\\" in Americana. Here's a list of the songs and a rating out of 10:<br />Disclaimer- 8.25 Cute, short, and a guy with a really annoying voice.<BR>The Meaning of Life- 10 Even with a thought provoking title this song kind of ignores it but it's still a great sounding song with cool riffs and fast paced head bopping.<BR>Mota- 9 A stoner's song, but good and fast paced none the less, similar speed to Meaning of Life but a different sound overall.<BR>Me and My Old Lady- 6.5 This could've been a decent song if it didn't drag on for so long. Only about half of it is actual lyrics, the rest is just music and odd humming-ish lyrics.<BR>Cool to Hate- 8.75 Offensive and fast, Offspring at its best. I played this song for a friend and she literally fell over laughing, so I guess it must be funny too.<BR>Leave it Behind- 7.25 This song is short and [mad] Enough said.<BR>Gone Away- 9.75 This song shows real emotion about losing someone you care about, it's a step up for the Offspring.<BR>I Choose- 9.75 This song can get you in a party mood after you listen to it. It could be considered as an equivalent to Pretty Fly or Original Prankster with its fun lyrics and pop-punk beat.<BR>Intermission- 9 This is relaxing...<BR>All I Want- 9.25 I first heard this song on Crazy Taxi and enjoyed it, which was one of the reasons I got the CD. Fast and odd lyrics, both which contribute to it successfully.<BR>Way Down the Line- 9.25 Talks about problems faced in life- child abuse, teen pregnancy, welfare, etc. and does it all with cool riffs and a fast beat.<BR>Don't Pick it Up- 8 Another short song with an interestingsound. This could've had a chance but it sounds too much like a garage band.<BR>Amazed- 8.5 This is a solid song, somewhat medium paced in comparison to the other songs.<BR>Change the World- 9.5 This is a good song with a guitar riff from Genocide and Smash throughout the song and some lyrics that could make you think...but probably won't. If you wait long enough you can hear a guy whose name I can't think of suggest that the Offspring suggest heavy metal ...
B00000AFHM|1.0|I just have to love all of these clueless reviewers calling this B&S music \\"super mellow lovely tunes to share with a loved one,\\" or \\"transcendent beauty,\\" or even \\"a harkening back to the gentle folk music of the past.\\"<br />People, do you even know what an arab strap is?  And how about Judy, who according to B&S, is a \\"dick slap\\"?  How about the beautiful orchestral song from their latest album, \\"Take Your Carriage Clock And Shove It,\\" which includes a few mentions of the f-word?<br />Underneath all of the so-called beauty is a subversive, slimey underbelly.  Supposedly, this is why the critics love them.  All of the hoity-toity people with one pinky in the air fall all over themselves talking about the \\"paradoxical dichotomy of the painfully beautiful, even uplifting music, juxtaposed with world-weary, deviant, subversive lyrics.\\"  Yes, if you want to be a critics' darling, you have to do something snickeringly cool like that.  Yes, too cool for words.<br />Give this a pass.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I liked Mulholland Drive.  A lot. (...)I thought it was very funny and beautifully shot.
0812550706|5.0|This is psychological science fiction- the technology and concepts serve the story, not the other way around.  It reads, however, like it's a simple story.  I found it a page turner, as apparently many other people on amazon did.  <br />And to me, this is the reason why so many people like this book.  Smart books that read easily are hard to come by.  I read a few reviews that found the book to be boring; I never found it to be.  The battle room sequences might be hard to follow if you're not an action fan...some people might find the politics behind Peter and Valentine's online column efforts boring...and a lot of people seem to flat out reject the idea of kids acting like adults.<br />Yet, although the kids are unrealistically clever and intelligent, they're still quite immature, bullying and teasing each other.  They're genetically engineered to learn faster, Card briefly explains (which might be why some reviewers seemed to miss the explantion), but they're still kids.  <br />Ender is a character that's very easy to identify with.  He has talents that he does not understand.  I often felt like I would have reacted to things the same way he does.  If I didn't feel the same way he did, I at least understood his reasons.  This book is closer to second person perspective than any other book I've read.
0345413377|5.0|In all honesty, this is the best book I have ever read. It made me laugh hysterically, and it made me bawl my eyes out. I have never enjoyed a book so much, and I can actually imagine my own daemon. I have an immense love for all the characters, especially Lyra, Iorek Byrnison, and Will Parry. Again, this is the most amazing book in the most amazing trilogy that I have ever come in contact with. And I'm not lying.
B00005RIKD|5.0|From classics like Roxanne and Every Breath You Take to the more recent Brand New Day, Sting and his musicians manage to make each track sound fresh. Soulful and jazzy, it's hard to not listen to this CD on 'repeat'.
B0000065M3|3.0|Elvis plays a hip young doctor helping out the neglected souls living in the ghetto. Mary Tyler Moore is one of a trio of nuns who arrive in plainclothes to work undercover in Elvis' clinic. Much romance and social consciousness ensues, all of it presented so clumsily and wrongheadedly that it sometimes made my jaw drop in disbelief. <br />A shy romance ensues between Moore and Elvis (who doesn't know that she is a nun), leading to the film's unbelievable concluding scene, in which...<br />SPOILER!<br />...Moore returns to the neighborhood's Catholic church. Unlike before, it is now a thriving center of worship led by Elvis singing and playing \\"Let Us Pray\\" (or something like that) on his guitar. Moore is torn between her vows and her love for Elvis, which is dramatized by cutting between the singing pop icon and the relics of the Catholic church. Elvis...or Jesus? Elvis...or Jesus?<br />A remarkably simple-minded film. I give it 3 stars because its so bad that it becomes weirdly fascinating.  Don't rent it unless the Ed Wood, Jr. bin of your local video store is empty.
B000001GYC|5.0|This is one of my top 5 classical piano CDs.  It has a relaxing, easy-to-listen-to sound that I never get tired of.  Every song in this 2-cd set is great.
B000002P5W|5.0|I recently purchased this on 180 gram virgin vinyl.  WOW!!  The CD sound is nothing compared to the sound of Jimi on vinyl, the way he was intended.  The songs sound warm and live on vinyl.  LITTLE WING and IF 6 WAS 9 are excellent along with SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC and CASTLES MADE OF SAND and AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE.  The drumming of Mitch Mitchell and the sound of the guitars of Jimi and Noel Redding make this a tight sounding and well recorded collection of Jimi's best.  The album was ... vinyl with a bonus booklet.  The album cover is gatefold cover with all the original artwork.  Highly recommended!!
B00003W8NM|4.0|In 1999 we were all spoilt with some of the best films Hollywood had to offer. Amongst this soup of fantastic film came a movie so odd, deranged and fantastic that it found immediate success.<br />'Fight Club' was the brainchild of David Fincher in his quest to make one of his favourite novels into a film. The result was fantastic; the film exceeded all expectations. It turned out to be a novel that was hard to put in a category. Too realistic to  be an action film, too crazy to be a drama, too dark to be a 'happy-go-lucky' comedy. So where does that leave the viewer???<br />A postmodern, black comedy dealing with the masculine need to fight and the power of one man to break through all sense of responcibility and live vicariously through an alter ego, namely 'Tyler Durden'<br />The film is an utter mind bend from the get go, in which the audience is treated to a montage, and trip though Jack's brain where we finally end on the barrel of a gun. There are few that can boast they saw the ending coming. I won't say if you havent seen it go and see it.<br />The performances are great Edward Norton is shining as ever and Brad Pitt is fantastic as Tyler Durden. Their perfomances make 'Fight Club' a great film, that could have been a sub-par film if not dealt with by actors of such a high callibre.<br />Well....how to conclude??? JUST SEE FIGHT CLUB!!!! See it again if you have, and see it for the first time and become hooked.<BR>Unfortunately for me by writing this review I broke the first 2 rules of fight club.....I TALKED ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!!!!
B000005Z0G|4.0|I admit I didn’t start listening to Tupac until Me Against The World.  When I first heard that title track I was instantly hooked on Tupac.    His flow, the complex lyrics, the beautiful musical backdrop; everything was amazing.  Everything was perfect.  I went on to pick up every album he dropped from then on, including Until The End Of Time.  <br />I just purchased this album a couple months ago.  It wasn’t that I had never heard of Tupac ( rape charges and Dan Quayle quarrels) it’s just that he had yet to drop a song that would make me buy an album.  The reasons I bought this was for Keep Ya Head Up and I Get Around, both classic songs, and to bring me one step closer to completing my 2Pac collection. (not including the low quality bootlegs).<br />I was surprised at how good this album actually was.  With songs like Streetz R Deathrow, Holla If Ya Hear Me, Point The Finga, Souljahs Revenge and Last Wordz, an excellent lyrical skill is showcased. However, the production is not that great causing it to sound outdated (except for a few tracks).  The sound quality of the cd is also low and would greatly benefit from a remaster.  He shows emotions on Papa’z Song, which is a prelude of things to come on Me Against The World.  I Get Around shows a glimpse of his later sound with a funky beat and breathless flow.  Tupac raps pretty good on here as well, but without some great beats they become an afterthought most of the time.<br />On this album 2Pac is just coming into the versatile, emotional, animated, charismatic character he is known for.  While not quite classic it definitely sets the stage for the latter part of his career.  An excellent cd for Tupac fans.
B00000JR29|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums from the 80's. I personally enjoyed the gold version of this better. But it is extreamly hard to find. This version has more songs on it and is darker. From what I understand this is the version the group wanted and the other versions are the for the general public lighter stuff.<BR>This album is probably most known for the song \\"Shout\\".
B00003CXMG|3.0|this movie is hardly what i expected, i enjoyed it but it did not deserve any oscar nominations or such critical acclaim. cameron crowe is going down in the quality of his films (vanilla sky is a terribly messy movie and the ending is totally dumbed down.) i would suggest fast times at ridgemont high and jerry maguire over this flick any day.
B000002MG1|3.0|I have always wished that REM had more of an edge, the lyrics are thought provoking, but my husband makes fun of them as being lulabys. I can't quite argue that either. This album, in my humble opinion seems to be the one that has more of an edge and as a result it the only REM album I have.
0385505833|1.0|It's rare that I don't finish a book that I've bought, but this was one of those. After it got to a point of total non-believability, much like a ridiculous sitcom in which the characters dig their own holes, I slammed the book shut and gave it to someone else. There are too many real stories, with characters and plot development and great writing, waiting in my library. This could have been a snappy, tautly-written commentary on misplaced values, but instead it was a draggy story of predictable (but not very realistic) human behavior. It was hard to like a single character or care what happened to any of them.

078401213X|2.0|Don't rush out to see it, it's really just a very well-done student film.  But it very effectively sustains a desperate and claustrophobic air, enough so that you mostly forgive its many flaws, which include reliance on dream sequences and no real investigation of the implications of its own ideas.  It has the momentum of a great movie, without being one.
B000001ES4|5.0|Of the 4 Secret Garden CD's I have, White Stones is by far the best.  It was a hard choice between White Stones and Songs from a Secret Garden, their first album.  Both are exceptional with hauntingly beautiful melodies.   But I still pick White Stones as their best. Was disappointed with Dawn of a New Century, and their newest album Dreamcatcher doesn't have enough new music, most of it is from &quot;Stones&quot; and &quot;Song&quot; albums, which I already have.  If you want beautiful, haunting, melancholy music, get White Stones and Songs from a Secret Garden.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|QUESTION? How can you rate a movie in ten minutes?  ANSWER? You can't!  I will admit, I was asking myself &quot;Where is this movie taking me?&quot;  Glad I stayed with it, beautiful story.  I never liked Nicole Kidman till this movie.  The best part is all the great songs from Elton John, Madonna to Kiss this movie packs them in.  It made me laugh and drop a tear or two.  Know wonder its up for so many awards.  I'll be hoping my new favorite star Nicole takes home an Oscar for this roll in which she deserves.  Plus Kylie as the Green Fairy!  Thumbs way up!
B000000WHX|5.0|Anybody reading millenial lists of albums/music/etc of the past 1000 years will have noticed this title sneaking into the top ten in several places. Considering that it was up against, to name but a few, Beethoven, the Beatles, Mozart and Mr Presley himself, this is a notable achievement. <br />The album itself is nearly perfect, the only off bit being the final track, in my opinion. Blue Lines still sounds as fresh and contemporary today as it did when released in 1991. As the intervening years have seen the birth and death of acid jazz, trance, girl power, boy bands, the final whimper from Acid House, and currently the mainstream popularity and almost inevitable fall of Nu-metal, this timeless quality would seem to be the satisfaction of one of the first criteria of true greatness.<BR> <BR>Go out and buy this; I genuinely believe that this album will still be being talked about in twenty, fifty and probably a hundred years, and will still be as popular then as it is now.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This is one of the great masterpieces of the Disney animation!<BR>Aurora, Maleficent, Prince Philip, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather are among the finest characters ever seen on the screen, and the settings and the scenes are absolutely gorgeous (Eywind Earle did  a great job indeed).

0140067477|3.0|Mr. Hoff, in quoting &quot;The Vinegar Tasters&quot;, may have misunderstood Buddhism. As a Buddhist, with some experience, I have never looked at the Universe as a 'setter of traps' nor am I embittered by life on earth. Just saddened. More likely, we are the generators of illusion and are working out our karma. Buddhism is more in accord with finding the lessons of our lives in our karma and taking responsibility. We do not turn away from the 'dust of the world'. We wipe it from our eyes.<br />Other than the above, I find joyful calm in its reading.
1558216847|1.0|At several points in the reading of this \\"tale of surrvival\\", I began to question it's having been purported to be a \\"non-ficrional\\" account of escape from a Siberian prison camp. It seemed a way to \\"perfect\\" narration, with all the bases covered:prison toruture, good guards/bad guards, a young female who joins the group along the way (no mention of any lustful interest in this person from any of these men who had not even seen a female for years etc.) When in the tale, they chose to go directly through the Gobi desert, instead of skirting it, I became suspicious. When little mention was made of the parched thirst they would most surely have experienced, I became even more suspicious.  I decided to go to Amazon and see what other readers had to say.  I was most pleased to read that I am not alone in my view.  This is a complete fictional tale of woe.  Shame on the publisher for putting this out as a \\"non-fictional piece. Do not waste your time on this outright attempt at deception.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, me and my friends have the soundtrack and the music has got us hooked! Nicole and Ewan made such a good team vocally and in their performances that anyone would have thought they were in love off-screen aswell as on! But credit must go to Baz Luhrmann i have loved all of his movies and i am a big fan, he has a creative and brillant mind, anyone would be proud of this musical masterpiece. A film i will never get bored with, i already have it pre-booked! a well deserved 5 stars!
B00004Z400|5.0|I bought this CD last summer, my only Deftones experience being the \\"Change\\" video on MTV and \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" on the Matrix soundtrack.  The first time I listened to it, I thought that it was really nothing special.  It disappeared into my collection for a few months.  I just took it out again a few weeks ago and it was like listening to a completely different album.  What had I missed before?  This is an amazing CD, starting from Chino's first scream on \\"Back to School\\" (a classic up there with Alice Cooper's \\"School's Out) to the long, beautiful closing track, \\"Pink Maggit\\".  Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Digital Bath\\" (this one is genius), \\"Street Carp\\", \\"Teenager\\", and \\"Passenger\\" with Maynard James Keenan, which is an incredible duet between two great voices in hard rock music.  I'm a Deftones freak, and I'm on my way to get \\"Around the Fur\\" right now!

B00005QZ7U|2.0|Pros: The directing was very interesting at times. Jim Broadbent (Zidler) was absolutely brilliant and a joy to watch as usual, except the 'Show Must Go On' sequence - the music choice was so obvious that it was almost painful that the director went for it (I like Queen a lot but...). Ewan McGregor - great actor for this kind of directing style, simply loved him. Nice costumes - almost as good as Topsy Torvy costumes. Cinematography was nothing but spectacular. <br />Cons: So called 'Love Story' didn't work at all. Nicole Kidman's performance and appearance was weak (not her fault though, just a poor director's choice). Constant 80's pop (and very much so) music was annoying (some spoken lyrics were funny though). At the end, the film's \\"energetic\\" style mixed with tedious attempts to make the audience feel for the lovers started to get on my nerves and I found myself turning my eyes off the screen to ease the embarrassment. I really wish she chose the Maharaja.<br />Bottom line: I didn't like it. A few very good ideas and two brilliant actors (Broadbent, McGregor) alone couldn't save this film.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This is one of my most favorite films of all time if you are interested in Ancient history or like movies like Spartacus or Ben-Hur you should LOVE Gladiator!
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie was terrific,but if my sister hadn't told me everything that was going to happen it may have been better.But,Bay did an awesome job as did the actors/actresses.Pearl Harbor was the best action movie I have seen in years.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Well i liked it a lot, it was really suspenceful and creepy when he was going into the matrix. It also really got me thinking. I watched it with my friend but she kept falling asleep during it cuz she always falls asleep during movies. I haven't seen it in a while so i can't remember that much. I did think Keanu Reeves was pretty hot in this movie though! I recomend this to peeps who like suspencful movies and in a way mysteries!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor must be some of the epic movies that has hit the big screein the last five years.Beautifully protrayed characters with realistic motions of war time.When I first saw it,it was breathtaking.I had friends that said part of it was predictable where one of the main characters&quot;dies&quot; in Europe.What I see on that part of the movie was a common scendrioduring the war when you thought some one was dead.The script was well written and the attack scenes are great.
0800130952|5.0|The best thing I can say about this film, is that it brought back all the wonderful emotions the book stirred in me when I read it as a child. While DeVito's vision of Dahl's children's novel is more comical and colorful than the book, the central character is very much the same. Our heart goes out to Matilda. By normal standards, her homelife isn't terrible, but Matilda is far from normal... she is extrodinary. Denied proper educational guidance from her parents, Matilda sets out for the public library at age 4 and has read Moby Dick and a wide assortment of Dickens by the time she enters school. School is both more terrible and more inspiring for Matilda... her school is positively horrid but her teacher is the most kind, patient, and selfless person one could find. For the first time, Matilda is introduced to someone who fosters her brillance rather than denies her it. All the performances; particularly those by DeVito, Pearlman, and Mara Wilson as Matilda; are brilliant. Depsite the fact that this DVD has been cropped by over 43%, I highly reccomend that you give this a rental and then buy a copy of the book. Should a widescreen version of the film come out on DVD, I wholeheartedly recommend you buy that.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie was very bad and it looks like its been made only for the money.The reason why James Cameron made Titanic is because he just wanted to make a good movie and not for the money.This movie had good effects but the script is bad.Don't see this movie and just go see Titanic instead.
B000000H40|4.0|The reason I like this cd so much is because it is simply one of the heaviset records i have ever heard.  The drummer donald Tardy, and singer John of the same name do great things on this record.  Along with the other members they make a great album, which after all this time since it was released in 1990, sounds very good.  It's remastered now so it even sounds better.  Hope you like it.<br />Although this genre is not my ideal music listening, you cannot ignore it.  Obituary will split your head in half while listening to it because it is so heavy and so well played. <br />People could do comparisons w/ other groups of this genre like Slayer, but obituary is somewhat above Slayer.  Slayer is good, but Obituary is much more extreme.  It's like a comparison between Led Zeppelin and P Floyd.  Zeppelin is classic r&amp;r, and Floyd is MUCH more.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Pearl Harbor was great.Definately a classic.Yes it wasn't solely based on the trajety at Pearl Harbor,the love story thrown in the mix was very authentic.Why did Titanic get such high praises and this movie bad reviews.Titanic was a love story based on a trajety,and Pearl Harbor is the same.Don't hate this flick,if you never seen seen it don't listen to the critics.Bruckheimer produces this,directed by Michael Bay,two of my favorites,and this is  another classic under their belts.I found it to be very emotional,the bombing scene was a whole another movie within a movie.Probably the best Special Effects I have seen.The acting,script,Randall Wallace is awesome,I have no choice but to give this movie 4 stars a classic.
B000003TAR|1.0|The people who give this album good reviews show that they know nothing about the nature of music. Even someone that has a rudimentary knowledge of scales will see just how poor and simple this album is. If you like Nirvana, you have no right to critisize todays mainstream pop. It's no different. Please, someone tell me how this is so great and innovative? Power chord changes, incredibly simplistic and repetative bass lines, etc. What am I missing? You wanna see some real guitar playing? Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Slash, Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde, Leo Kottke, and Tuck Andress to name a few.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is one of the worst movie's i've ever seen.The script,acting,plot is terrible.Michael Bay can't direct and he needs to get out of the movie industry.Don't watch this movie ever.
B000002IZ4|4.0|While STP's sophomore effort might not be as good front to back as Core, it is still a great album and a must for any STP fan.  But, what STP album isn't worthy of many accolade's.  Core might be the best debut album of all time but Purple is a great follow up which kept the STP wave rolling!  And, that wave still continues all these years later!
B00005MP58|5.0|Jane Austen could not have asked for a better movie adaptation of her book. I am definitely \\"Old School\\" and believe that when making a movie of a classic piece of literature the movie should try very hard to stay true to the book. The people who made this movie did not let me down. There were some changes made to the plot line in the movie, but they were minor, and in some cases I actually liked the changes, which I guess means that I think that movie makers were able to make improvements in their telling of Austen's story. <br />I have always cherished the book of Pride and Prejudice, and now I have the movie version to cherish as well. It is so much fun to be able to see this beautiful story told visually. The costumes are excellent. The casting was superb. I cannot say enough good things about this movie.<br />The DVD is great too because it has a featurette on the making of the movie and it was very interesting.<br />Just for fun, I will mention the book and movie \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" the modernized telling of Pride and Prejudice.  They are both hysterically funny and the movie has the added delight of having Colin Firth in it!!!!
B000001LKY|5.0|The quintessential Spacerock album.Powerful,spacey,epic-a must for any Spacerock collector!\\"Warrior\\" finds Hawkwind at the absolute zenith of their creative trajectory,in complete control of the Spacerock genre they pioneered.Aside from capturing the band's Spacerock formula at it's most fully evolved,the album also documents it's strongest line-up of musicnauts ever.The disc also showcases bandleader Brock's most lucid and evocative lyric work to date( -check out \\"Magnu\\" and the \\"Assault & Battery/ Golden Void\\" block-arguably the finest ten minutes in ALL of Spacerock history ).Taken on whole,the power,majesty and epic sweep of \\"Warrior\\" is the sonic equivalent of a Frank Frazetta painting....
B00004UEIF|5.0|This is just one of Evan's most outstanding albums.  If you haven't had the pleasure of discovering one of the masters of jazz piano, don't hesitate a moment more!  You will not find a better introduction to this stirring music.
B00005MCX3|5.0|Hawkwind at their most melodic and magical!This 1974 release, culled from both Studio and \\"live\\" Mobile tracks,chronicles a mellower,more harmonious side of the band.This hynotically enchanting album is perfect for late night listening.Employing a beguiling mix of natural Earth and Space Age instruments,\\"Hall\\" weaves a timelessly bewitching spell!For more info on Hawkwind and the Progressive/Spacerock scene visit the \\"All Time Classics\\" Webpage...
6300213498|4.0|I loved the episode so much when I first saw it six years ago,that it inspired me to begin an original serial using a Nona type character as the lead, and Tyree's people as my character's adopted people. Some reading this would say &quot;so what?&quot; but others would say that if an episode that has such good writing can inspire a budding writer, it's gotta be good! As to the Viet Nam parallel that people are referring to, I see the episode as just good story telling on it's own merit.
B000002U82|5.0|Arguably,the finest rock concept album of all time.This legendary 1973 \\"Classic\\"(-it's remained on Billboard's Top 200 chart for 14-years!)has become THE \\"benchmark\\" against which ALL OTHER progressive rock is measured.And for good reason.In terms of shear musicianship,engineering technique and lyrical content, \\"Dark Side\\" is virtually unequalled.It's timeless lyrics and groundbreaking engineering techniques have reverberated throughout rock and audio engineering circles ever since.Aside from being the ultimate \\"stereo test\\" disc,\\"Dark Side\\" is an absolute \\"must have\\" for the Progressive Rock aficianado.No matter how extensive a Progrock collection is,it ISN'T complete without this disc!For more info on Pink Floyd and the Progressive /Spacerock scene visit the \\"All Time Classics\\" Webpage at: ...
6305903182|5.0|Everybody always said that this was the stupidest Scream movie of them all. I don't think so! Personally, I think that the second one was the stupidest one and that the first one was a classic.   that was my favorite one. i think maybe because Skeet Ulrich (Billy Loomis) was in it. It had a good plot and actors and actresses. I really don't think that this movie should of been rated r.. i guess it's because of the stabbing and swearing but i don't think that swearing is that bad so.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I loved this movie because it showed the blessings that come from honoring the marriage vow.  Mrs. Nash loved and supported her husband, no matter what \\"hell\\" she went through doing it, and in the end they had a strong love and conquered Dr. Nash's problems together.  It gave me a very triumphant feeling.  I love the music; the soundtrack is as beautiful as the movie.
6303983812|4.0|First, it's just cool they used cats as the animal in this film.  what other animal would be able to play jazz in such a swingin' way.  but seriously, did you notice how every cat was of a different heritage? Dutchess and the kittens, French, O'Maley (Irish) ... who had an incredibly long name (Abraham D'Lacy Geocept Percacey Thomas O'Maley, O'Maley the Alley Cat), which Dutchess noted &quot;covered all of Europe.&quot;  When we're introduced to his friends, we have a Fats Domino type chubby gray trumpet playin' &quot;Scat Cat.&quot;  The bass player's from Eastern Europe, Russia perhaps or in the 70s would have been USSR?  The hippy guitar playing cat with big glasses and beads, the possibly Swiss cat on accordian.  They're all &quot;cats&quot; but of different places, all jamming and all linked to O'Maley enjoying life together.  As this movie was comin' out of the late 60s, Disney's showing America that anyone, from where ever they're from or however they talk, can all be friends and hang out.  Unfortunately, they give the British a hard time, with the fun loving gabbin' geese who inform the audience that in being british, they aim to &quot;keep things proper.&quot;  The butler, too, was British, I believe.  Poor guys.  Not only that love everyone and have a ball attitude comes off the screen, but the movie also encourages practicing and teaching the arts-painting, piano, singing (even with the proper syllables!  (&quot;do me sol do re fa la it goes.... when you play your scales and your arpeggios....&quot;) what a cartoon!
B00005U1YO|4.0|This is a very good album. It isn't as good as Surrender, but it still has some great tracks on it. &quot;The Test&quot; is one of the best songs I've ever heard. Richard Ashcraft's voice just sends emotions right through you. (I wish the Verve never broke up) but Pioneer Skies is a great song as well. Overall, there are about four or five great songs. The rest are good and again, there is &quot;The Test&quot; which is flat out amazing.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Okay don't be mislead by the 4 stars, this is a great cd, but of all the albums Shakira has released, my humble opinion is that this is the worst of the best.  Shakira really reached a suprising high point in her career with &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot;, because it was such a 'high point' it's difficult to meet expectations for the next album.  I think that Shakira tried something very daring and bold.  On her first album released after &quot;the big one&quot; she tried to go english at the same time.  Yes I think that Shakira will do very well on the english scene.  Latin singers are doing very well and so she will shine, but I think that she should have waited a little bit.  <br />Now this cd is great, it's classic Shakira except in english.  The first track Tango (obsession) is a very fun song to dance to.  Like other reviews I will praise Shakira's voice quality and ability to sing in english, which is like her third language, behind spanish and arabic.  Although this album lacks the lyrical quality that her spanish cd's are noted for, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is a great cd for first time Shakira purchasers and for anyone who likes the latin sound mixed with rock.  For the long time Shakira listeners &quot;Laundry Service&quot; may be a bit of a dissappointment, but be open and give it a chance.  You'll recognize the great quality we have come to expect from Shakira.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This film is a breath of fresh air when you think about all the uninspired hollywood drivel that is being released nowadays.  It is superbly acted, and I think Kubrick's hard edged ideals, and Spielbergs gentleness, yet realism make this film a must see.  This film was one of the finest I have seen in years, I think it deserves to be on the Oscar lists for more than sound editing and score.  Haley Joel Osment is Wonderful, the artwork is spectacular, and I think the biggest plusses would be the chances that it takes. This is filmaking at its best, original, moving, and uncompromising, even if it does end on a happy note.  I don't know about you but don't mind walking out of a theater entertained, and happy.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This movies is my all-time favorite for the war genre.  It was well worth the $20 million price tag for Turner Pictures.  Gettysburg is the classic war saga minus the romance along the lines of Gone With The Wind.  The performances of all the actors are splendid.  My personal favorites are the performances given by Tom Berenger as Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, Richard Jordan as Gen. Lewis Armistead, Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain, Sam Elliott as Brig. Gen. John Buford, and of course Stephen Lang as Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett.  The performance by Jordan was to be his last as he became ill with a brain tumor and died 9 months after the filming of Gettysburg.  He is caught between love and war with his long-time friend Maj. Gen Winfield Hancock (Brian Mallon) on the opposing Union side.  Armistead suffers considerable agony which is obvious to even the casual viewer especially when the director Ronald F. Maxwell spends considerable time on Armistead trying to bait Lt Gen Longstreet (Tom Berenger) into relieving Armistead of the upcoming battle.  Jeff Daniels was a very big suprise for me.  I picture Daniels in the toilet scene from Dumb and Dumber and would not have cast him myself in this epic, but that just shows the genius behind casting director Joy Todd.  Sam Elliot's role as Buford can be summed up in the following quote  \\"Meade will come in slowly, cautiously, new to command... And then, after Lee's army is entrenched behind nice fat rocks, Meade will attack finally, if he can coordinate the army. He'll attack right up that rocky slope, and up that gorgeous field of fire. And we will charge valiantly, and be butchered valiantly. And afterwards men in tall hats and gold watch fobs will thump their chest and say what a brave charge it was. Devin, I've led a soldier's life, and I've never seen anything as brutally clear as this\\"...wonderful!  Alot of love was given to the filming of this movie.  5,000 non-paid re-enactors were hired to play the roles of the thousands of anonymous faces.  Even Ted Turner himself picked up the musket and was among the ones counted during Pickett's charge.  He can be seen, but only for a nano-second.  I can write forever on this films' qualities but to finish it up, the accuracy in this film is phenomenal.  The greatest example of this is how Ronald F.Maxwell uses actual quotes recorded by soldiers from that famous battle.  Gen. Pickett: \\"Up men, up! And let no man forget today that you are from old Virginia!\\"  Gen. Armistead: \\"Virginians! Virginians! For your land - for your homes - for your sweethearts - for your wives - for Virginia! Forward... march!\\"thousands of anonymous faces.  Even Ted Turner himself picked up the musket and was among the ones counted during Pickett's charge.  He can be seen, but only for a nano-second.

B00005JKMO|5.0|The movie \\"Ali\\" portrays the story of one of the world's most recognized boxers, Mohammed Ali (who was born Cassius Clay).  <br />Actor Will Smith gives an excellent performance as boxer Ali.  It is hard enough to portray a real character, much less a legendary one.  Smith is successful in showing not only the physical side but also the charisma of the boxing personality, Ali, who has strong convictions and a funny wit.<br />The movie begins with Ali's fight against boxer Sonny Liston, which puts him on the map as a fighter.  It ends with Ali's fight with George Foreman in Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of Congo).  This famous fight was billed as the 'Rumble in the Jungle.'  In between, the movie covers the fighter's rise to success, his conversion to the Muslim religion, his name change and his fight against the U.S. government to keep from being enlisted in the army. We also see Ali's close friendship to two well-known people - sportscaster Howard Cosell and Malcom X.<br />The movie \\"Ali\\" also touches on the boxer's attraction to women and some of his many love relationships.  (Smith's real life's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, plays the role of Ali's first wife.)  Ali is certainly attracted to all pretty women!<br />All the actors give wonderful performances - Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown (the man who worked to motivate Ali and help him with his rhymes - \\"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!\\"), Jon Voight as Howard Cosell, Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, Mykelti Williamson as Don King, Giancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay Sr., Jada Pinkett Smith as Sonji Roi (Ali's first wife) and Nona M. Gaye as Belinda Boyd, to name a few.<br />The shots especially of some of the African countries (Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa) are vibrant and rich.<br />Although I'm not much of a boxing fan and sometimes found the boxing scenes a bit prolonged, all in all I found the movie a great story of a great athlete set to a great music soundtrack.

Yes, this is classic Disney, and it is a beautiful story well told. Beware the scare factor for some smaller kids - the intense atmosphere of the jungle and some of the &quot;suspense&quot; scenes can have 3-year olds concerned to the point of being turned off the movie alltogether.

B00005A46T|3.0|I generally listen to death metal and black metal, and I know that most of the people that like these genres utterly despise the 'nu-metal' style which is the most popular right now. Personally, I enjoy some nu-metal bands but dislike the majority of the genre.<br />A friend of mine introduced me to Slipknot not long after the release of their major label debut. I really enjoyed that album -- with its high points being 'Eyeless,' 'Purity,' 'Diluted,' and 'Eeyore' (the hidden track). It's a lot harder and heavier than most of the other nu-metal that's out there, and I find it to be a solid release.<br />The band was hyping this new record for a long time before its release. It was supposed to be so much better and so much heavier than the first album. I heard it compared to Slayer's 'Reign In Blood' by singer Corey Taylor, and even heard there was going to be a Terrorizer cover on the album (although this apparently didn't make the cut). I was excited about this new album.<br />There are some improvements on this album, but there are other things lacking on it. The hip-hop influence is pretty much gone on this release, which is a plus. The guitar-work is more improved on this album, and less distortion is used. I think the improvement may be due to the addition of Jim Root (#4), who played only on 'Purity' on the first album, and was now on the whole album this time around. Joey (#1) is, in my opinion, a great drummer, and on this album, his drumming is much improved and more technical. However, the percussion of Shawn (#6) and Chris (#3) is used less on this album. And Sid (#0) and Craig (#5) are barely on the album. Corey (#8), the vocalist, over-uses his clean, more radio-friendly (typical nu-metal style) voice than on the first album, which was barely used on the first album. The lyrics on the album get kind of corny at points (the '555, 666' chorus of 'Heretic Anthem' for example), which didn't happen on the self-titled album. The songs also lack the speed thatthe speed that the last album had.<br />'Gently' and 'Iowa,' two re-makes from Slipknot's independent release 'Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat' are, much like the 'Tattered & Torn' on the self-titled album, not as good as the originals. 'Iowa,' the re-make of 'Killers Are Quiet' lingers on for longer than is necessary, and the lyrics of the original song are much better than the new ones. This isn't to say that the songs are bad, but they're not as good as what they once were. 'Left Behind' is obviously the 'Wait and Bleed' equivalent of this album, and I find this track to be disappointing. They promised 'no singles,' but this is obviously meant to be a single.<br />It seems like Slipknot tried to make more of a straight-up heavy metal album and, in doing so, they got rid of the elements that made them stand out. <br />The bottom line: If you're new to Slipknot, I reccomend checking out their self-titled album. It's an original metal album, and stands the test of time (I've had it since '99). If you're already a Slipknot fan, you'll probably want to check this out for yourself. I give this 3 stars, because it is a good album, but not 5 because I expected more.
078062999X|5.0|This movie is stunning.  GET THE WIDESCREEN EDITION.  The full 70mm print is one of the most crisp and clear I have ever seen on VHS.  I hope this eventually comes out on DVD.  Yes, there are some small differences between the way 'Hamlet' was written by Shakespeare and the way it was conceived and brought to the screen by Mr. Branaugh, but none of them justify the complaining by some critics of the film.  The acting is among the best this film buff has ever seen.  Superb.  The sets are enormous and beautiful, and the score is heartbreaking.  Please don't miss this movie.  It is long, but who cares?  Just lose yourself in the splendor....essential.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is an amazing band who can be listened by people of all ages as they are a heavy metal band that I like and they do not swear so they can be listened by younger children.<BR>What I really like about it is that you can make out their words unlike bands like Slip Knot and Korn which also swear heavily. My favourite song on this was Runway.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the soundtrack (and movie) that we Tolkienites were waiting for and it has not failed to dissapoint. Howard Shore has found the perfect balance, mingling the mystical, almost haunting voice of Enya with some rich, vibrant themes. The soundtrack is suitably grandiose and sombre when required. Personal highlights were the triumphant crescendo in 'A Journey in the Dark' when the party reached the dwarwen city of Dwarrowdelf and the inspiring 'Numenorian/Aragorn' theme touched upon at the start of 'At the Sign of the Prancing Pony'. I hope that this theme, which wonderfully portrays the kingly lineage of Aragorn is explored more in the soundtracks for 'The Two Towers' and 'Return of the King'. Other great tracks are 'Concerning Hobbits' a light and joyful theme,perfectly suited to hobbits and the darker 'A Knife in the Dark'. 'The Bridge of Khazad-Dum' is full of thumping drums and deep chorals, presenting a haunting portrayal of the menace of Moria and the soundtrack is appropriately completed by the wonderful 'May it Be', sung beautifully by Enya.<BR>If there is one complaint I do have to make, it is in the length(or lack of it). I hope that an extended version to include all music in the movie is released as only this will truly satisfy Middle-Earth devotees and lovers of great music. Otherwise, don't deprive yourselves of the pure joy in listening to one of the best film scores since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Buy it now!
0131103628|5.0|If there could be only one book to read for anyone interested in starting computer programming, and this is it. The focus is on describing the C language and providing a sound understanding of the principles of C programming. Not a step-by-step, how-to book, but a more fundamental and purposeful explanation of the C Language. I often recommend this book to programming students as a book to judge all other computer books by.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is fabulous! The music, characters, costumes, story line, everything!  It is wonderful how they integrated modern music into a story that takes place over a hundred years ago.  The soundtrack is very catchy - I downloaded all the songs after watching - and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have spectacular voices.  I've heard that people will either love or hate this movie, and I certainly felt the former.  If you love musicals, Baz's work (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet, etc.) then you will love Moulin Rouge as well.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|This movie is a 2-hour cliche. Detailing the downward spiral of heroine users is NOT an original, or even noteworthy, endeavour. These characters were losers when the movie started and they were even bigger losers at the end. Many reviewers will give accolades for the effects used here.  Fast-motion, slow-motion, tight frames, split screens, etc. These were mildly interesting the first time they're used but quickly become annoying by mid-movie. And will someone take that harness camera away from Darren!!  The only interesting element of this movie was Ellen Burstyn's character. Ellen deserves all the praise she has received for ther portrayal. Everyone else involved should apologize.
B00004SC3M|5.0|It might be the subtitle for this highly entertaining action-thriller. In fact it's more a cat and mouse game... but who's the cat? In the best tradition of Hitchcock's \\"To Catch a Thief\\" it's a well balanced movie.<br />Sean Connery is in his top form when mixing duty with humor.<br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones is amazingly subtle in her role. She starts out cocky and glizzy only to end up being confused to the kazoo in her encounter with Connery.<br />This is a pure actioner, not a minute passes without a twist in the plot and nobody stands still for much too long.<br />There double-crosses, triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses,... well in fact, there are so many crosses one could become dizzy...<br />It's a harmless no-brainer, but so well acted and directed that you will be constantly gripping your armchair just to see what happens next.<br />The DVD edition is not top notch, but with a movie like this one who cares... You get engulfed into the action practically as the movie starts and the rollercoaster ride ends when the movie ends. So who's got the time to examine wether frame 121 was sharp enough or if that squeeky noise on the right channel was really perfect.<br />Once you enter in the game it won't let you loose one minute and you will almost shout at it to stop, but as Zeta-Jones, you will be dragged even deeper into the charade and be so fascinated by it that you won't want it stop once it does.<br />The finale is a pure surprise and, though not unexpected for a Hollywood movie, truly original.<br />If you like this kind of movies, this one is certainly for you and will keep you guessing to the end on the who does what to whom and why... but who is really what and does really what to whom? Have fun with it... and let the ride of your lifetime begin...
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore brilliantly encaptured the moods of Lord of the Rings.  His melodies and orchestrations were the perfect accompaniment to a wonderful film.  I knew when I saw the film that he would be nominated for an Oscar.  I hope he wins!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|One reason movies are made is to help people escape their own lives. If you want to see Moulin Rouge for historical pursuits you've come to the wrong place. Some of the reviewers on this DVD need to lighten up and take the movie for what it is...a fantasy.<br />I for one appreciate the use of songs from different eras for the purposes of story telling. This is a rich and wonderful film. But judge for yourself.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's final film, an exploration of the darker side of relationships and sex, is nothing less than a masterpiece -- a perfect ending to a brilliant career. I will say nothing of the plot because I think this film is best viewed knowing as little about it as possible. Just know that it can open your eyes (no pun intended) to how you view relationships. If you like any of Kubrick's previous work, you're sure to like this one. And it doesn't matter if you never have seen a Kubrick film -- get your start with this one. Cruise and Kidman's performances are flawless, and as with all of Kubrick's films, the production is stellar. I cannot recommend this film highly enough.
B000058T5E|5.0|OK with a hyperbolic title like that the prospective buyer isn't at all sure what they're going to get. Truth is (no pun intended) I was expecting a more bluesy, rocky album from Jeff Beck. At first listen I was pretty damn shocked. This isn't really an album for guitar purists. It IS an album for those that wish that dance/techno/whatever? music was a little less synthetic and contained some real-live musicians playing real-live instruments. After a few listens the true genius of Beck becomes apparent. His tone and precision are incredible. The solo at the end of Left-Hook totally blew me away, as did the sitar-like beauty of Nadia and the ethereal Suspension. Buy this album. Jeff Beck is a genius and deserves to be supported!
B000001ESJ|4.0|One of my big problems with this album is that for [the money], one would expect a bit more than 35 minutes.  Sure, back in the day, LPs couldn't run for 75 minutes like CDs do today, but still, we could squeeze in a little more than 6 songs on this album!  Other than that, this is one of the three albums that competes for my vote of Best Rush Album, along with Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures.  This was the album that started the era of a more experimental, progressive sounding Rush.  After dabbling in epic songs from Caress of Steel and 2112, it seems like Rush has now refined their craft into a style that would skyrocket them to fame and onto the shelves of any 70s fan.<BR>The opening and title track is, in my opinion, one of the best songs they have ever written.  Lyrically, the words are contemplative but don't wind up getting corny like Peart tended to do in that time.  The song itself is complex, but not so overly indulgent as to lose its audience.  I still haven't figured out the meter to the jam in that song!<BR>Xanadu shows us how much Rush has come along in writing epic songs.  Perhaps their best one, if that moog didn't make me laugh every time I hear it... ah, how synthesizers have evolved over the years!  Peart sets out to show us that he actually does of knowledge of classic literature and succeeds.  Subsequent epics would go over the top and just wind up sounding like nerdy prog-rock, but this one sits quite nicely with any fan of the time.<BR>Closer to the Heart:  Every Rush fan knows this song by heart.  Every non-Rush fan has to live with that.<BR>Cinderella Man:  Actually a very underrated song.  Perhaps because it's not the showcase of talent and structure that the rest of the album shows, but still very much worth the effort.<BR>Cygnus X-1:  Yes, this is a real black hole (I remember it mentioned on some documentary).  This is also the song which, as I mentioned before, shows Peart turning potentially great lyrics into an episode of MysteryScience Theater.  10 years ago, this song kicked all...; then I started getting intellectual and the lyrics annoyed me.  However, what it lacks in lyrical beauty it more than makes up for in incredible musicianship.  The ending to this song is simple and creepy, and leads me back to my original complaint:  I want more!<BR>This is an album that defined a classic band, and paved the way for many neo-prog bands that I've also come to enjoy.  A bit pricy for the shortness of the album, but contains some of the best that Rush has to offer.
B00000JZIK|5.0|This is a mystery/crime drama of the 1990's that is one of the best films of all time.  JMO..<br />It has all the elements of what I feel truly makes a movie \\"one of the best\\".<br />The Screenplay - without a decent screenplay, you have a bad film.  This is without a doubt an amazingly great screenplay.  It makes the film.  While it does borrow from old films from time to time, it is just so well done.  Good job, screenwriter! You got my vote for Eileen's Oscars as the Academy sometimes doesn't know what they are talking about.<br />The Acting - Totally awesome acting here.  Kevin Spacey, hands down, is the best actor around right now.  The rest of the cast is excellent.  Kudos to Chazz Palminteiri!! He is very convincing as the cop.  I love when he goes off on Verbal Kent about who Kaiser Sose really is. Little does he know...<br />The Plot -- This is a great story.  The first time you see it, you will not be sure who Kaiser Sose really is. I knew, but my husband begged to differ.<br />The ending  -- One of the BEST ENDINGS of a movie ever!! Well, next to Casablanca, it is the second best<br />This is just all my own opinions, but I've seen this movie several times now, and just like it more everytime.  It is very well crafted in every capacity a film can be.<br />It is worth buying!!  I gotta run out and get my copy soon.
B00004XQ83|1.0|I felt this movie was horrible and the soundtrack enhanced that opinion.  I left the theatre feeling bored and cheated that I had spent one penny on it.  It seems to me all the people involved with the realization of the soundtrack have no clue what this style of music is about.  Pick up the original recordings of this stuff from labels like Pearl, Arhoolie, and the like.  A sountrack where most of the pieces are successfully performed by  contemporary artists, is the sountrack for the documentary, Crumb.
0440219078|3.0|The most recent time I read this book it only took a matter of hours. It was required reading in both seventh and eighth grades, and now again in tenth. The notion behind this book is sound, however it fails to have a target audience. Its brevity makes it appealling to younger children, however most ten year olds would miss the deeper meanings imbedded in this novel. Older children, or adults, would I believe not appreciate this book because of its length. It would be much better to read Zamyatin or Huxley, if you are of an age to understand the sociopolitical issues that are behind this story. As a book, it is only of value as a diverting read for younger children, with minimal deeper meaning.
0553212478|5.0|THis isn't the old Frankenstein story you think it is.  THis is simply an amazing story written by a very young woman.  I was blown away as to the emotional strings this book pulls.  An absolute must-read!
B00003CXXO|5.0|This movie gets mixed reviews, and it's interesting to ponder why. To some it is just sentimental fluff, to others a deep and absorbing critique of what makes us what we are. The parallels to the Pinocchio story in the film are obvious, but rather than desribe the whole, there was one particular scene I thought worth highlighting.<br />First, some background. The plot is mostly about a \\"child\\" robot (David), searching for his lost mother. At one point, he finds a statue of a blue fairy under the sea, and he thinks, from a long lost fable, that it will make him a \\"real boy\\" and take him to his mother, so he begins to 'pray' to it-ala the Virgin Mary. At this point a huge structure gently falls on his undersea craft, and traps him there. His talking teddy bear says, \\"We are in a cage\\".<br />To me this scene is very poignant, and delightfully, but sadly contrived. Whilst the child is in this state, he is indeed trapped in a dreamworld, in which his mind cannot perceive reality. The parallel to some religious states can't be missed. For two thousand years, he sits there and prays, until awoken by futuristic beings. The important thing here, is not that he prays to a statue, or dreams, or hopes, but that he is trapped there and can't get out. *He has come to the point where he can no longer break free from his dream*.<br />In the context of the movie, as Jude Law says as 'Gigolo Joe', \\"to wish for something which isn't there\\", is peculiar to us, as opposed to the robots, but which perhaps defines us, and the film. The desire to \\"dream\\" gives us so much hope, so much happiness, and so much love, but paradoxically also causes so much misery. We are trapped in this conflict.<br />The subtext of the film-the search to be in \\"the place where dreams are born\\", perhaps lies at the crux of human consciousness, and it is that we can be trapped by such a desire \\"for that which isn't there\\"... \\"in a cage\\", which, paradoxically, causes so much happiness and so much human misery. This is what the robots in the film ultimately desire, but which in the end, in the film, seperates us from computers-artificial intelligence, or paradoxically perhaps, sugests we are ultimately just the same. See it for yourself and decide.<br />The movie is very melancholy and deeper than most people would like.<br />Something to think about.is is what the robots in the film ultimately desire, but which in the end, in the film, seperates us from computers-artificial intelligence, or paradoxically perhaps, sugests we are ultimately just the same.

B00005OWEG|4.0|Apocalypse Now (the original) is, and always will be, one of my favorite movies of all time.  Forget about what it says or doesn't say about the Vietnam war - it is simply a fantastic, epic motion picture.  So, when I heard that Coppola was releasing his director's cut as it were (i.e. A.N.Redux), I looked forward to seeing the extra footage with great anticipation.  Unfortunately, I found it to be a bit of a let down.<br />Perhaps, it's because I've seen the original version so many times, but I felt that the additional scenes added little to the story, and made the movie too long (something I usually wouldn't complain about - but this time I think the studio was right).  The French plantation scene (especially the dinner - much of it in French without subtitles) seemed to drag on and just didn't seem to fit in with the story (even the music doesn't match with the rest of the movie).  The segment about the rendevouz with the stranded bunnies was both implausible and just plain weird (I mean, what's with the corpse in the box?).<br />One of the criticisms frequently heard about the original, was the final section with Kurtz (Brando); many people felt its pace was too slow; again, adding footage of Brando doesn't help it any, in my opinion.   <br />I'm almost sorry now that I watched this version, since it will forever taint my memory when I watch the original again in the future.  If you've never seen the movie, I'd stronly recommend watching the original - it is a classic.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This film could have been a lot shorter and than I would have liked it more.  As usual Tom Hanks is great and does an excellent perfomance once he lands on the island.  However, there are a few flaws in this movie that could have been approached differently.  For example the scene at the end of the movie was a little to weird for me and not very credible.  On the overall scale it does make one appreciate every moment of life as we never know what tomorrow will bring.  Unlike \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" filmed years ago this protrays man in a truer sense of abandonment on an Island all alone with no one to talk to.  It makes you wonder how he was motivated to get up every  morning.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The reviewers who slam this pic are soulmates with the film's own character of The Duke - they just can't see beyond the tips of their noses.<br />If you want your movies nice and vanilla, stay away.  If you'd rather see another version of the same old same old, stay away.  If you can't keep two thoughts running in your head at the same time, stay away.<br />Otherwise, welcome to the Moulin Rouge - this year's only Oscar film to actually reinvent the idea of movie making.
B000003BEV|4.0|You really don't know the stones until you have haerd this album.  It is one of their oddest, but bands have to grow and expand in sound.  Yeah, it is a copy of the Beetles Sgt. Pepper's, but they do it with the darker rolliing stones syle.  For c5rying out loud, give them a change to experiment around with the sound.<br />We gague the Beatles by albums, Elvis by singles, and the stones and the beach boys by their image morfe than anything sle, and this is a tweak to the image.  yeah, the cover is goofy, but it's the image of the band more than anyting else.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and both times I enjoyed it.<br />Long, probably so but no longer than many WW II movies of the past.<br />In order to make a good historical movie that everyone \\"can\\" enjoy, you need three things:<br />Romance, Action, and Reality.<br />The romance portion of this movie is exactly how it was back then. No one was sure whether they would ever see each other again so life was, shall I say, lived to the fullest.<br />Many people fell in and out of love several times due to death or loss of a partner.<br />Of course this movie plays an old angle, have the best friend fall in love with the girl when the first goes missing.....well we all know it happened and still happens. You could probably find several stories from wartime veterans of just such an occurrance.<br />The action part? well, it goes without saying, afterall this is a war film and even though the film isn't riddled with war footage, there is plenty to keep the average person entertained.<br />There was also enough of a break between combat sequences; from the British Air Force footage to the Doolittle Raid with the attack on Pearl Harbor right in the middle; that I never got overly tired of watching things blow up.<br />Historically everything that occurred during the actual combat footage happened.<br />I have read and heard some say that Cuba Gooding Jr.'s appearnace was only to fill the void of no Black actors. This just isn't so....Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays a real-life hero of World War II, the first black man to win the Navy Cross.<br />The woman too were portrayed accurately. They may be there because they thought it would be exciting and they would meet men, but when they are needed, they are strong, brave, and dedicated.<br />Of course as with almost all war movies, there is bound to be inaccuracies. Screenplay writers and dirctors both know that if you follow history to the letter you have a documentary, not a story everyone can enjoy.<br />It could also be mentioned that the portrayal of the Japanese was probably softened somewhat. Political correctness virtually prohibits writers from telling the truth of how brutal the enemy was at the time. Even though Japan is one of our greatest Allies of present day, they were our enemy 60 years ago...<br />But this movie is reminiscent of many past war movies. Filling all the needs of romance, action, and (hopefully) accuracy.<br />By the way: I had my parents watch this movie with me. My Dad was stationed in the Pacific right after the war started and my Mom worked at an army Fort in the states.

B00003CXI1|1.0|the lord of the rings is written for adults, so if you are a kid, then youmust see this harry potter movie.  It tells the story of a young orphan who learns his destiny, and he is also an accomplished pilot.  He has a girl, hermes, who is not his twin sister who helps him out.<br />This movei also has alot of extra special special effects, which drive the movie along the path to sucess.  They have a novelization of this movie whihc I have read, and I liked it.
B000002B7S|5.0|There seems to be this misconception that Jake E. Lee is not as good as Randy Rhoads. First of all, it's just not true. He was simply different that Randy. Jake had a very unique style that I have yet to hear anyone copy.(which is good) Jake gets dissed alot because he wasn't Randy, plain and simple. The &quot;introduction&quot; to the keyboard was not introduced on this album, but on Blizzard of Ozz. The keyboards used on this album were more experimental than anything, contrary to the belief that they were used to help out Jake E. Lee's Guitar playing, and any true Ozzy fan would know that. Where are the keyboards on The Ultimate Sin?(another brilliant Ozzy album) Ozzy is also the furthest thing from pop music. His music was never directed at the &quot;pop&quot; crowd. Ozzy simply knew how to make great music that appealed to alot of different people. Ozzy has kept up his style on BATM, even with a new guitar player. If you have heard alot of Ozzy albums then you know that Ozzy likes to have a couple ballads with his metal, which is evident on every single Ozzy album ever made. I hold every Ozzy album in very high regard, and therefore, have nothing bad to say about any of &quot;The King's&quot; work. Get this album and you'll love it forever.
B00005OM4N|5.0|the most fascinating thing about this disc is that brittainy has a lot of freudian slips in the lyrics--\\"overprotected,\\" \\"not a girl, not yet a woman,\\" \\"lonely,\\" \\"cinderella,\\" \\"what it's like to be me.\\"<br />I hope this nice young gril doesn't end up like willis or kimberly from different stokes, but she may be heading this way.  marilyn monreo was the first manufactured bombshell and hollywood is keeping it up.  she isn;t a poerson but a product.
6304806426|5.0|English Patient is a thinking man's (or woman's) movie. The main story of a disfigured man and his nurse is paralleled by the man's story of he and his love. Beautifully shot and told through flashbacks, the story is set during World War II. English Patient won Best Picture in 1996. Also, Anthony Minghella won Best Director. Ralph Fiennes is excellent as the burned \\"english patient\\" who tells his story to his nurse, Juliette Binoche, who won Best Supporting Actress for her betrayal of Hana. Katharine is played by Kristin Scott Thomas, an excellent British actress; Willem Dafoe, Colin Firth, and Naveen Andrews round out the cast. Overall this is my favorite movie and deserving of the Academy Award it won. English Patient takes you away to another time and place and has you relive every moment of this man's life and agony. Well worth watching! ENJOY!!

B00005NTJM|4.0|This, the first album by the newly formed group named Jethro Tull was first issued in 1968 (around Sept.), and clearly shows that there are two forces at work here within the band.<br />  On the one hand there is Mick Abrahams being the blues personality who turns in very respectful outings in the song titles of 'Cat's Squirrel' and 'Some day the sun won't shine for you', a shared vocal outing with Ian on the song 'It's breaking me up' and even turns in an adequate vocal with 'Move on alone'.<br />  On the other hand you have the band leader we all know and love in Ian Anderson providing the band with the necessary artistic stylings and outlets to make the band achieve the potential that they would.  Songs like 'My Sunday feeling', 'A song for Jeffery' and 'Dharma for one' showcase the band ability to play beyond the confines of the current \\"Blues Revival\\" that gained momentum during the time of this release. The remaining songs on the album 'Serenade for a Cuckoo' and 'Round' show the inflection of jazz that would be a continuing influence, albeit a lessening one, during the bands career. Even the included \\"bonus\\" tracks like ' One for John Gee', which is not available elsewhere, show the strong jazz influence that would llift the band from the blues positioning that would have kept the band to a modicum of success as a local club favorite.<br />  One often overlooked facet of the band during this period was of course the rhythm section of Clive Bunker-drums and Glen Cornick-bass which would only last for two more albums before the latter left the band and the always clever Bunker would only last until the often heralded 'Aqualung' album.<br />  Whether you like Jethro Tull in its early or later configurations This Was Jethro Tull, and by all accounts this album fits nicely within their catalog.<br />  The digital remastering only adds to the glory of this album, I for one would recommend this current release over the past straight analog to digital transfer offered in years past. And as for the money, this is a steal for only $x.ars past. And as for the money, this is a steal for only $x.
6305013578|5.0|this is a good movie.  It has everytihing I like in amovie--action, adventure, love, romance, and good beating up evil.  It is silent, but has music with it to entertain you like in the old theaters.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I don't understand why some people put a parallel between European and American preferences. The album is very solid and I think that the sound will satisfy American fans better as it is close to the sound of bands like Metallica. However, this is still Iron Maiden with their typical songs. 'The Ghost Of The Navigator' is the best song, also 'The Mercenary' and 'The Wicker Man' can please every heavy metal fan. Steve Harris does not miss the opportunity to put one of his anthems in this album: 'The Nomad', this time in collaboration with Dave Murray. Bruce Dickinson combines styles of his previous Maiden period and his solo career, while Adrian Smith is better than ever. Not that it is the best, but the album meets the demands. Compared to the musical products of the mediocre American bands who are at the top of the charts it seems to be a masterpiece.
B000006TRV|1.0|i say the inside art to the duble LD and it sc ared me.  the music didn;t help.  why do bnands like being so scary?
B0000251W2|5.0|This is one of the most profound Iron Maiden records. It is the first album ever in which they use keyboards. Adrian Smith makes a supreme contribution by his unique songwriting represented by singles 'Wasted Years', 'Stranger In A Strange Land', and 'Sea Of Madness', while Steve Harris offers us one of his trademark opuses: a song called 'Alexander The Great' in which we can listen to some motives taken from Balkan folkmusic. Another hit is 'Heaven Can Wait'.
B00003CX9E|5.0|An absolute cultural treasure! Great value for the money. The Ebert and Bogdanovich overdubs reviewing the technical aspects of the movie and  pointing highlights are excellent for non-scolars like myself. The PBS program about  Hearst versus  Wells is an extra bonus, and adds to the historical significance of the movie.  The entire package makes for many hours of viewing, and education.
014017821X|4.0|Before it was trendy to adapt fairy tale themes into adult fiction, there was Angela Carter.  <br />In _The Bloody Chamber_, Carter works with a variety of fairy tale and folkloric themes, crafting them into very adult stories written in a style all her own.  Somehow, her prose manages to be hauntingly strange and deliciously earthy at once.  I didn't like all of the stories in this collection, but I very much liked some of them, and I'm glad I read the book.  I especially enjoyed the title story (a retelling of \\"Bluebeard\\"), and \\"The Lady of the House of Love\\", quite possibly my favorite vampire tale ever.  In it, the tragic lady Nosferatu reads her Tarot cards every night, and every night draws cards signifying death--until one night she draws Les Amoureux, the Lovers, and everything changes.  Splendid.<br />There is more here--a raunchy \\"Puss in Boots\\", two takes on \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", several stories dealing with werewolves and/or Red Riding Hood, and much more.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is a truly great band with every new CD topping the previous.  Tool is not a bunch of Rock Stars, they are Artists (anyone who has been to one of their shows would know, its not your typical Rock show).  There last 2 CD's, Aenema and Lateralus are their greatest, but not at first glance.  To understand and appreciate Lateralus most you can't just listen to it once and make your decision nor can you listen to it as background music.  Tool music demands focus for you to enjoy it on a level that you probably never have with music before.  It is a very rare cd that becomes better the more you listen to it, at first listen you think \\"Ok, this sounds new and refreshing, but it's so-so\\", listen to it again and you think \\"Hmm, there is something else in this, hard to pin point\\", by about your forth or fifth time listening you think \\"Wow! This is brilliant, powerful, moving, layered and Maynard's vocals are as good as it gets\\".  And unlike most music, you will still be thinking that by your 1000th time listening.  Its one of those albums that you can listen once a day for months and months and its continues to get better.  Iv always said, \\"True art is never appreciated at first glance\\", this is definitely true for Lateralus.  Remember, if you are skeptical about this album, give it a chance, at least 2 or 3 good fully focused listens strait through and you will understand what Art really is.  Trust me on this, this is not your typical heavy metal or rock band, there is something different and you have to search for it.

0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a quite possibly the best book that I have ever read, I could not put the book down. The whole concept for \\"sameness\\" is a great idea and the book is riveting. The ideas are so interesting and thoughtful that it made me appreciate what I have, choice. The rebellious Jonas was quite inspiring as he dynamically changed. From his once bored, predetermined life, he became human, showing real emotion. <BR>The story has many intellectual concepts as well. \\"Seeing beyond\\" and \\"hearing beyond\\" are some of them. Jonas's first memory as the \\"Receiver of Memories\\" is he on a sled, atop a hill, while it is snowing. Ironically that is how the book ends. Could Jonas have the mental capacity to see his future? I thought this is a very interesting concept.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Yes, this is a film like most any groundbreaking or specific director's vision that will cause people to love it or hate it. People who like musical theatre have both hated it and loved it. People who don't like musical theatre have both hated it and loved it. It just depends on how the film grabs you. If you don't like the first 10-20 minutes--wait--because the film's tone changes. It's like ROMEO AND JULIET. The first part is a crazy, comical spectacle. The second half is a gut wrenching, beautifully filmed drama. The film is thrilling and majestic. The DVD is FULL of incredible extras. If you listen and watch how Baz and his creative team made the choices that became this film, you really understand how well thought out this film is. I love the film even more knowing that there is indeed an intelligent method to the madness. And hey, the film hold the National Board of Review Award, Golden Globes, and 8 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Seems the Love it audience is bigger than the (vicious) Hate it audience. I love this film and especially its DVD extras.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Kate and Leopold was the most creative romantic comedy that i have ever watched. Meg Ryan was amazing and the movie kept you wanting more!
B00005RDRO|5.0|I was so happy when I discovered this movie had been released on DVD.  I saw it a long time ago and I remembered it being one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  It did not disappoint. While it is true that the ending is confusing, and the plot may not be all that original or make any sense, what makes this movie great is the almost constant string of one-liners delivered perfectly by the all-star cast.  Much has been made (rightly so) of the phenomenal performances of Maggie Smith, David Niven, Peter Sellers, and Peter Falk, but in my opinion the greatest movie moment comes from the octogenarian Estelle Winwood (incidentally, Tallulah Bankhead's lover) when something is revealed about Miss Marbles and Lionel Twain.  It's a classic.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|We saw this movie as PPV on DirecTV, and enjoyed it so much that we went out the very next day and purchased the DVD for ourselves. It's not for everyone: it is loud, obnoxious, and borders on ludicrous at times, but it has so many examples of brilliant acting and clever combinations of lines, effects, costumes, lyrics, music, camera angles and so on that you owe it to yourself to at least try it. We felt that it did a wonderful job of bringing some of the best characteristics of great stage and theatre to the screen - stuff to make you laugh, stuff to make you cry, stuff to let you feel a little bit good in a situation otherwise dominated with despair and sadness. The casting was excellent, and everyone rose to the challenge of bringing life to characters larger than life very nicely (Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec was particularly good, not to detract from Kidman and MacGregor). Rehashing songs from Elton John and Madonna and a host of other modern artists seemed bizarre at first, but we were delighted at how well it actually worked. The all-male \\"Like a Virgin\\" song and dance scene had us freaked out, but we had to admit that we were definitely enjoying ourselves despite our stunned disbelief (it's not gross, just weird).<br />Word of caution: if you're 10 minutes into it and don't like it, you might as well bail. It seems like an all-or-nothing sort of thing: you love it, or you hate it. Count us firmly in the former group.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This album is great- its filled with great melodies and great lyrics.  I kept on contimplating on buying this CD over and over again ever since it came out, and i am glad i finally bought it.  He's alot like Pete Yorn, or John Mayer, if you need a comparison, but his styling is alot more intimate and downtempo.  It has a couple of upbeat songs, but for the most part they are melancholy and very personal.  The lyrics on the album are wonderful- i dont know how you could find better ones!  Even the first song, Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk, is a great song with a great melody that will have you singing along by the song's end.  The only difference between this one and the old version is the bonus track &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, that is used in the &quot;I Am Sam&quot; movie.  Its a great cover originally done by the beatles, and I like it better than when the Beatles, or Fiona Apple did it.  Theres no reason why they should put remix on it- its the exact same version from the soundtrack.  The video is now getting airplay on MTV2.  This is a great album, and do yourself a favor and pick it up.
B000002HH9|5.0|Despite the bad reputation Wild Mood Swings has, I love the album.  Some of the tracks are misfires, such as Gone! and Round and Round and Round, but others are simply elegant.  Bare is a captivating and depressing song, and Jupiter Crash is one of my all time favorite Cure songs.  Club America is a wonderfully insightful, and the 13th is just a fun song.  Several fans claim this album doesn't cover new ground, but tracks like The 13th and Strange Arraction are experimental and different for the Cure.  Robert's voice sounds amazing (as usual), and the album is definately worth a listen.
B00004Z459|3.0|I would like to start off by saying, that Linkin Park is NOT nu-metal, those who call them by that name do not know the metal genra. Nu-metal would be Slipknot, Mudvayne..etc. But on to the review for Hybrid Theory...i will not praise this cd, becuase this is a kind of music that has been around ever since Rage Against the Machine came out so long ago. Linkin Park does an ok job in bringing together their voices with their instruments, but that is where their talent stops. Their rap/rock mix is not something that is new, and even their lyrics are unimaginative. Like the song &quot;one step closer&quot; when the lead singer starts yelling &quot;Shut up when im talking to you...shut up...shut up&quot;, come on, while those lyrics mix ok with the song, they could have come up with something better than that. I will give them praise in that, their lead singer does have a good voice, and maybe if he was in a different band that had more of a hard rock/metal edge to it, he would be good. Linkin Park gets too much airtime for a mediocre band. There are some songs on this cd that are worth listening to, but all in all, you could save your money, and just listen to all their songs on mtv, or the radio. Or, just borrow it from your 11 year old neighbor.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This CD is getting very mixed reviews. Some people hate it and some love it.  The first time I heard this CD I said to myself \\"what in gods name are they doing?\\" after a couple of listens i got really hooked i was ready to give this cd 2 or 3 stars after the first time.  There are only a few downfalls though.  There are some sounds that don't need to be there.  Like a turntable?? There is a bunch of effects that are kind of pointless but it doesnt make it sound worse in any way. Mike Portnoy is amazing on this cd.  This is his best drumming yet. it is incredible what he can do with his feet. Jordan Rudess does some of those wierd sounds and stuff but hes got some kick butt solo's that will blow your mind. John Petrucci has a some 80's metal riffs and some incredible solos just like the rest of there cd's. John Myung is really great although I fell with this album being so heavy and all there should of been a bass solo. James LaBrie doesn't sing into the \\"stratoshpere\\" like the rest of there albums he explores many other kinds of voices and you can tell he can do what ever the hell he wants with his voice.  This CD over all is pretty heavy. \\"the glass prison\\" is extremely heavy.  The rest of the songs are medium loud.  \\"disappear\\" is a slow so and it is very good.  The 42 minute \\"epic\\" needs some more volume like the rest of the cd but just the fact that they can write a song that will keep you interested amazes the hell out of me. Buy this cd no matter who you are and dont get an opinion after the first listen give it a chance.
B00004R9A3|3.0|The storyline in &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;lagged a bit,and the songs aren't too memorable(the only song I ever remember from this movie is&quot;Substitutiary Locomotion&quot;).However,the animated sequences in &quot;Bedknobs&quot;was done a lot better than the animated sequences in&quot;Mary Poppins&quot;(the soccer match was funny!).David Tomlison was funny in the animated sequences,but his performance was disappointing in the live-action scenes.(David was a LOT more convincing in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;).
B00005NWM3|3.0|I tried to like this album.  And I mean I REALLY tried.  But quite simply, I don't.  There are at least 4 bands in this genre that I would listen to before Nickelback: Tantric, Bush, Fuel, and Puddle of Mudd.  Tantric is an amazing acoustic rock band that doesn't get the credit it deserves..... yet.  Their sound is much better than Nickelback's, even if Nickelback rocks harder.  Bush's songs are much more diverse than Nickelback's.  Their songs are unpredictable and powerful, and I can't say the same for Nickelback.  Fuel's lead singer sings with MUCH more emotion than Nickelback's lead singer.  At times it sound like Nickelback's singer is struggling through his songs, whereas Fuel's lead singer has a powerful voice that pulls the listner in.  And Puddle of Mudd isn't really all that much better than Nickelback, but their album is better than either of Nickelback's two albums.  POM's album didn't bore me at all, yet I found myself skipping through much of this album to see if the following song would be any better.  The problem was that the first 9 songs aren't any better or worse than each other cos they don't offer anything different.  The last song is the best on this album, just because it doesn't follow the same formula the first 9 follow.  That, and the fact that at least Nickelback is playing the right type of rock right now (as opposed to the horrid Korns and Limp Bizkits) saves it from being a one star album.  However my advice is to give one of the aforementioned bands a try before you try this one.
B000000OAN|5.0|When I look back over the last 20 years or so of rock n roll's history, I often wonder why Queen was never mentioned in the same breath,&amp; with the same level of respect, as Led Zeppelin. I recently bought a greatest collection of Led Zep, &amp; I realized why I made a right move in not investing my $$s in LZ in my growing years, &amp; choose Queen instead. Do I think &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is the greatest rock song of all time? A resounding YES!!. If you don't agree, it was voted in '91 by the British Phonographic Industry as the Best British Single of the last 25 years. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; may be a great song by itself, but it doesn't hold a candle to Bohemian. I say that b'cos, for one, Stairway's climax chord progression is typical in rock, e.g. can be found in &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; &amp; &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;; i.e. you can copy it, &amp; get away, but nobody cannnot re-create &quot;Bohemian&quot;. That is the rule of being a genius. Freddie Merc was a better lead singer/showmanship than R Plant/Mick Jagger, &amp; Brian May's guitar sounds almost always more intelligent than Jimmy Page's. <br />Night At The Opera is a defining moment for Queen &amp; Rock. Bohemian snowballed the effect of video music, &amp; opera rock never sounded better. Freddie's gone &amp; I do miss him, but when he was around, Queen was always able to stay close to the times. I mean, you won't hear Led Zep do a &quot;Another One Bites A Dust&quot;!! That is also what this album is all about - daring to take risks, &amp; Queen has always done that. BTW, nobody played synthesiser in this album!! Cheers Queen
0380973650|5.0|Whereas this novel is different in concept and theme than Neil Gaiman's past (Neverwhere &amp; Stardust), it is equally as magaical and transporting.<br />It tells the story of a man, Shadow, that was just released from prison.  He meets Wednesday, who offers him employment - which seems like a streak of good luck... or is it?  Shadow is sent on a series of adventures all over America... risks danger, meets ghosts, and of course... gods.<br />Like all of Gaiman's novels, this is a fantasy novel with language so rich, you can step into the story.  But unlike the others, this is the first one to take place in America (Gaiman himself is British), which makes it kind of fun for American readers.<br />In story form, he reminds readers what happens when people start forgetting the past and their heritage and allow for technology to take over.  With personified gods and an outrageous, yet incredible story... this book gets the point across delicately.<br />&quot;Neverwhere&quot; was the first Gaiman book i ever read... and still remains my favortite.  It was so enthralling, i couldn't even put it down.<br />&quot;Stardust&quot; was the second i read... and was a fairy tale told for adults... which was uplifting and beautiful.<br />But &quot;American Gods,&quot; is like a whole new sophistication for Gaiman.... i was shocked at the intensity and complexity... but pleasantly surprised... and i can't wait for more.
B0000048V8|5.0|We were given this video as a gift the day before my 3-year-old had surgery to remove a tumor.  She watched it that evening and then at the hospital several times before surgery, and continuously after surgery.  We are not big fans of videos as entertainment, but this video is unlike any other.  It is beautifully done, wonderfully imaginative, has gorgeous orchestral music underlying it.  There is just absolutely nothing about it not to adore.  For my daughter is was peaceful and lifted her out of days of pain.  You can't describe how wonderfully fanciful it is.  You simply must purchase it to love it for yourself.  And if you love this one, do yourself the favor of also purchasing the video of Raymond Briggs, The Bear.
B00005S8FC|5.0|This CD is my favorite album of the month.  It lies somewhere between jazz/tango/techno... which is a weird, yet beautiful combination.  It is similar to the St. Germain/Zero 7 kind of electro-jazz... but with a world music feel.  It is gentle enough to be great dinner-time music, music to read by or relax... but at the same time, it is interesting and unique enough to just sit and listen to, and remain entertained.<br />It's definately a new flavor.... and i love it.<br />Check it out.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie was a real treat. Mike Meyers is spectacular in his role as a gentlt scottish ogre. Cameron Diaz also gives a good performance as a princess saved by Shrek. John Lithgow's role as a dimunitive king is also quite amusing. Overall this was one of the most entertaining movies of the year.
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham, famous author of the courtroom drama novels, has branched out yet again with this book.  The first try at a holiday story for Grisham sees him write a funny story with a good moral.  The book is an easy and quick read.<br />Set at Christmas time, the book analyzes all the \\"craziness\\" that accompanies the Christmas season and what would happen if we chose to skip Christmas for one year.  It is easy to relate to many parts of the story, and you will see yourself, your neighbors, your family, in the characters of the story.  Hopefully though, if you have paid attention to the story's moral, you will realize just what Christmas is really about by the end of the story.<br />A good book to read during the Christmas season as a reminder to enjoy the holiday for what it really is, and not what it has become.
0812550706|5.0|I was required to read this book in High School.  While I have enjoyed reading for most of my life, this book did much more than give me something to read.  Through Ender's Game I was able to understand that every situation is different to every person.  It was through this book that I am able today to see both sides of an arguement.  When any of my friends graduate high school OR college this book is, at least, part of their graduation present.  I have read the entire series (so far) of Ender, but this one is entirely different in its importance on me.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Who would of thought these three ex-punkers would not only shed the punk image, but mature and evolve into a whole new band. After the release of 1994's \\"Dookie\\" Green Day suffered many insults from their once loyal punk fans, claiming they had \\"sold out\\". In response to much slandering the boys put out \\"Insomniac\\", their hardest, fastest, and most intense record to date, lashing back at the insults with fierce vocals and lyrics. Then it happened...in 1997 \\"Nimrod\\" was released, which seemed to be the bands farewell speech to the punk community, with the album came a new alternative sound that not only gained them respect in the music community, but a new loyal base of fans. Don't worry folks this whole history lesson does have a point to it, and if your still reading I'm assuming you have figured that out already. \\"Warning\\" is not only the band's most mature album yet, it's also another evolution in their sound. Acoustic instead of electric (there still is electric do not worry), integrity not intensity. Yet through all this the signature sound of Green Day has not dissappeared, in fact it's stronger than ever, and the patient fan will reap the enjoyment of listening to this excellent release.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. Harry Potter has an enchanting feeling around the entire movie. I strongly suggest that anyone, no matter their race, age, etc, should go see this movie.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|NO, this is not about folk music!!!I expected LOVE AND THEFT to be like TIME OUT OF MIND...well it isn't and that's fine with me. Bob Dylans voice finally sounds like Luis Armstrong and he seems at ease with his raspy yet tender voice. Check out Po' Boy and Missisipp,his vocal pacing is fresh and relaxed. Dylan hasn't rocked in years...well, he does with Tweedle Dee and Honest with Me. These two ramblers tumble with the catchiest bass lines since BLONDE ON BLONDE. There are no weak songs here..only wish the CD was longer. This albums very consistent <BR>yet shows Dylans versitility and growth...yes, he still has something to say. This one is a keeper!!!!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Of course this is a great CD, its full of Beatles songs. I must say that they are the greatest band I've ever heard, and I think that they singlehandedly got rid of any competition for who's the best band. Sorry folks, the Beatles can never be beaten!<BR>Anyway, the songs are great. It would be stupid to have a Beatles greatest hits album, cause there'd be so many, but their No. 1 hits here, are good, not all the best beatles songs by any means, but these i suppose were at one point, the hit song. Love Me Do and all the early love songs are an incredible launching pad for the beatles' career. There is also the classics &quot;a hard day's night,&quot; &quot;Help!&quot; &quot;Let it Be&quot; and, IMO, george's best ballad, &quot;Yesterday.&quot; Hard to beat it, I must say. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; is IMO on my beatles top ten or so, but if I had to choose all ten, I'd feel like I'd be leaving so much out. That's how good the Beatles are i tell ya.
B00005RHGK|4.0|The opening scene alone is proberly more frightening than most horror movies are throughout . it features two kids driving back from college to spend there summer break with family but unfortunately they get a few suprises on the way when a mystery black truck appears and makes there journey a lot more than they bargained for .......this opening scene sets the pace of the movie throughout which never lets up and some cases had me jumping out of my seat if you want a good fright - look no further - just remember these words &quot;Jeepers Creepers where did you get them peepers - you are about to find out?........
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is not a documentary, nor was it intended to be one. What Pearl Harbor is, is an engaging romance centered around two young pilots and a navy nurse. The attack itself lasts an intense and action filled forty-five minutes. From there stems the results and actions taken to react to such a horrific Sunday morning. Pearl Harbor is a blockbuster motion picture intended for entertainment, on that front it does not disappoint, but only soar into the ranks of movies and events such as Titanic.
078881172X|4.0|This is one of the best movies Disney has ever made.  The reason I gave it four stars is because the women are made as the enemies in this film. But as a child that didn't matter. Your children will love dreaming that neverland really exsist. I highly reccommend buying this  movie for your children.
B00003CY5J|4.0|\\"The Score\\" is a one-of-a-kind thrill ride of a heist movie that has three generations of highly acclaimed actors that you'll ever see in one movie: Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and Edward Norton, each arguably the single most talented actor of his generation. So what if the film they have chosen for their act-off is a minor heist drama? These three provide a heft that, for the two hours of watching this movie, makes director Frank Oz's \\"The Score\\" both pleasurable and involving.<br />De Niro stars as Nick Wells, an expert jewel thief who also happens to run a jazz club in Montreal. He has eluded the law for his entire career by sticking to his three rules:<br />1.) Avoid excessive risk.<BR>2.) Always work alone.<BR>3.) Never pull a job in the town where you live.<br />Nick is tempted to put aside those maxims when Max (Brando), a longtime friend and underworld crony, offers Nick $4 million to steal a jewel-encrusted 17th-century scepter from the Montreal Customs House. Nick agrees to the job, promising his flight attendant girlfriend (Angela Bassett, who hasn't been seen a whole lot in this film) that it'll be his last. But Nick soon develops some doubts both about the job and the ambitious young accomplice, Jack Teller (Norton), with whom Max has teamed him up with Nick. And one mistake, just one little mistake, could bring down not only Max and Jack, but Nick as well!<br />The number of scenes between Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro crackle, offering a fascinating clash of acting styles. (Of course, this is their first time onscreen together; they shared the role of Vito Corleone, with Brando in 1972's \\"The Godfather\\" and De Niro in 1974's \\"The Godfather Part II\\".) To me, I think that Edward Norton, whose character fakes being simpleminded at times, has the flashiest role, but smartly steps aside when both De Niro and Brando strut their stuff. The DVD version of \\"The Score\\" is very well-made with some extras including the making-of \\"The Score\\", the original trailer, and deleted scenes. Check \\"The Score\\" out and you'll agree that it's one of the excellently made caper movies around!
B00003CXXP|5.0|What makes this film so amazing is not the special effects or the gee-wiz imagery, or even the plot line.  As with many Kubrick films, they're not really for \\"entertainment\\" but to provoke thought.  The title of the film, A.I. is the first question that Kubrick asks - is it really possible to create intelligence?  If so, then define what intelligence means.  Is there more to intelligence than simply logical reasoning?  Are emotions somehow part of intelligence?  Of course, you the viewer, must answer those questions.<br />And in the end, think about what the aliens are trying to do, and what they say.  Or rather, what is Kubrick really saying.  Is it that he believes that humanity/intelligence, no matter how sophisticated technology becomes, can ever be duplicated or created?  Does the soul have something to do with intelligence?  Again, you must answer that within your own definition of intelligence.<br />I can see why so many people disliked A.I.  They spent $9 to be entertained, and instead found themselves in a college philosophy class.   If you're the type of person that likes to sit back and be entertained, than this movie is probably not worth your time nor money.  If you like thought provoking films, than this is a typical Kubrick film, with the warm fuzzy Spielberg throw in for extra measure.<br />There is so much more to this movie than I can write about in 1,000 words.  If you've already seen it and hated it, perhaps you'll spend the $5 to rent it and take the time to really understand what the film is saying and asking.  It really is an interesting piece of work.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|It baffles me how many good reviews I keep reading about this movie.  I saw it for the first time last weekend, and I'm pretty sure it's the WORST thing I've seen in the last 2 years.  It makes the movie Bats look like Citizen Kane.  <br />As much as I can be fond of her, Drew Barrymore and this film seemed to struggle towards the same goal: to appear clever.  This film left me with questions that I don't even want to know the answers to, mainly about the whole time-frame of the picture (how long has this kid been taking medication, how long has he seen this rabbit, what the hell does The Evil Cult of Swayze have to do with anything?).  Maybe I would re-evaluate this film if someone raved about it in an intelligible manner, instead of just saying this Bubble Boy kid is an amazing actor, and it's sooo original.  It just seemed like a tired formula of a misunderstood rebellious teen who is supposed to become martyred in the end.  The era it takes place in is just about as inconsequential as about 8 of the other \\"sub-plots\\".  Also, note to the director: Cussing at the dinner table, followed by a little kid repeating it is so well-worn that it's depressing.  All this does is make the American Pie kids howl with laughter.  Oh yeah, and that \\"Cellar Door\\" plot device sticks out like an Eric Roberts Academy Award nomination.<br />If you are looking for something truly psychological that digs its claws into your head, I recommend Barton Fink, The Minus Man, or Straw Dogs.  If you're just looking for a more entertaining movie, that's easy, just see if your local family-owned video store carries Disorderlies, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, or Night of the Creeps.<br />It's a shame that a film like Run Ronnie Run gets shelved while this celluloid turd basks in the sunlight of shallow critics.<br />Of course, this is just my opinion.
0671799320|5.0|As an engineer who has worked in both exploration and refining, I would have to recommend this as required reading for anyone who works in the oil and gas industry.  Several years of working in the industry have given me a knowledge base, but nothing like the education Yergin gave me in The Prize.  This book looks at the history of oil from its beginnings in Pennsylvania, the Standard Oil Trust, the middle east and all the other major discoveries that laid the foundation for the world's largest industry.  The most interesting part of the book I found to be the major part oil and its supply played in both world wars.  I had no idea what a crucial factor it was in instigating and ending the wars.  What an amazing book!!  It may be a bit long for those who are not familiar with the industry.  But even so, for anyone with a thirst for knowledge about the world we live in, it will be extremely entertaining.  Well deserving of a Pullitzer Prize when it was written.
B000002MFE|5.0|This is the first Clapton CD I bought back in college.  At the time, I didn't know what the Blues was, but I liked malted milk and hey hey.  This album came out around the time of Nirvahna's unplugged which is also borderline blues.  Anyway, I have listened to this disc more times than half of the rest of my collection combined.  Before church sundays every week in college I played this disc faithfully (i know every note, noise, word on this disc like &quot;never again&quot;.)  Something reverent can be found in the music here. This is a perfect album from a perfect artist.  After this album, Clapton released the phenomenal &quot;From the Cradle&quot; which I owned for almost a year before I even listened to because I didn't get it.  Now it is one of my alltime favorite albums.  Clapton single-handedly introduced me to the blues genre, and his music stands as the finest testament to a superior musician.  You can't go wrong with this album.

B00004THAY|5.0|This album has been woven into a special moment of my life:  I played &quot;Marry You&quot; in the car directly after proposing to my wife, and the First Dance Song at our wedding was &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine.&quot;  I couldn't think of a better song for kicking off a lifelong marriage.  Enough said, this album is premium music from premium artists.
0060254920|5.0|I am currently in my last year of college and one of my professors just recently read us a children's book.  I was quite surprised when it turned out to be Where the Wild Things Are.  Although this is a children's book, everyone enjoyed hearing the story about Max and his magical journey.  Where the Wild Things Are is by far one of the best children's books ever written and illustrated.  I loved it as a child and I still love it as an adult.  The book provides children a chance to use their imagination.  This is a book that I will use both as a teacher and with my own children someday.  Whether you like the story itself or you just like to look at the illustrations, this is definitely a book for people of all ages.  A must have for every classroom and household.
B000001FN3|5.0|I actually heard this album AFTER I had heard other later work by Alan Parsons. I was floored to say the least. Every song (or piece of work) on this album is good, if not a masterpiece. It's hard to say if a touch of Pink Floyd's influence is detectable in this work, but if you like Pink Floyd, You'll like this also (even without the guitar being a major component on every song). With the intro and interim narration by Orson Welles, this is as much a work of art as it is a rock album. This ranks right up there with the best theme rock albums ever (if not the best), and is my favorite by APP.
6304602979|5.0|Tarantino does his magic on this script, which is less complex than his other films, but quite a bit more fun. He didn't direct, but Tony Scott (Spy Game, Top Gun) did and he knows what he's doing. The movie is a rollercoaster ride of funny scenes and gunplay, with some big name actors to boot. Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater are very good together, and were cast perfectly. I like the scenes where Elvis talks to Clarence. They're quite funny, and whoever plays Elvis (Think Batman) does a great impression. This is a good movie to watch with friends, and 've actually found it to be a good date movie. I recommend this to action fans, romance fans, drama fans, comedy fans... Hell, why doesn't everyone just go see True Romance?
B00005OWEG|4.0|Having spent one year in the jungle of the Philippines working on this once-in-a-lifetime event, I can honestly say that I am truly, profoundly astonished at the protracted popularity this production has achieved over the years. We knew that what we were working on was cutting edge material, because no one in mainstream Hollywood wanted to even touch the extremely delicate (and by today's standards, \\"highly politically incorrect\\") subject of the Vietnam war, so we knew we were bound to evoke a clamorous response. But never in my wildest dreams did I ever conceive that 25 years after wrapping that shoot, it would be re-released, due to its malingering influence on an ever-growing audience, covering two generations. I am absolutely floored in disbelief!<br />     I wish I could convey to all the readers of this review the incredible memories and fantastic sights, sounds, and smells of the day-to-day experience of working on such a bizarre film in an even more bizarre and remote part of the world. For example, one scene that was never used took place in the Kurtz Compound, where Francis Coppola wanted to have stray dogs eating out the guts of some of the Viet Cong & NVA prisoners. When his make-up man, Freddie Blau, explained to him that all his expertise and artistry could not produce the reality and intensity of the scenes that Francis demanded, \\"alternatives\\" were located in order to get the proper results. When it was discovered by a crew member that the Prop Dept. had obtained 7 unclaimed bodies from a morgue in Manila and were to be the Viet Cong & NVA victims in this scene, several personnel on that production threatened to walk off the set due to \\"egregious\\" violations of their union contract! That's how insane things were becoming. For a brief tip-of-the-iceberg glimpse into the madness and magic of the making of this movie, one should rent or buy the video documentary entitled \\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse\\", which moves much closer to this subject than I have room for here and now.<br />     Unfortunately, after having worked with an academy award- winning director, and 2 academy award-winning actors (Brando & Duvall) on an academy award-winning movie, my show biz career never really caught fire like so many of the other actors whose futures that film so greatly enhanced, especially Marty Sheen's.<br />     Alas, I wouldn't trade any of the harrowing and mesmeric images permanently ingrained in my mind that took place in that God-awful jungle, for anything in the world! Although brief and fleeting, my 15 minutes of fame have proven to be incredibly durable through this Coppola master work. You'll find my name next to the credit \\"Major From New Jersey\\". If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them at liberty. May God bless.<br />Daniel Kiewit
0790744759|5.0|This movie is one of the vary best of this time period. A loving family with real problems for a change, and the music and voice of judy Garland make this movie sparkle. I always watch this movie when I'm sad, or just need a flashback to my childhood. I recomend this movie to everyone, weather your a fan of old movies or not. Even if you hate everything that Judy Garland did,you'll love this movie.
B00005JY1B|5.0|Great movie.  Loved it.  Sending a copy to my mom too.
0783228570|5.0|Scarface is a great movie.  I would say that it is one of, if not the best gangster/drug movies of all time.  It is a remake of a true story of Al Capone.  Al Pacino plays Scarface, aka Tony Montana.  He is a Cuban immigrant who immigrates to Florida as part of the people that Castro released.  This time was known as the Cuban crime wave.  Tony works his way to the top of the world by killing and selling.  The movie is very realistic, except for the ending, where he should have died much sooner.  Overall, this movie is a classic.  If you like gangster/drug movies, you will love this one.  I highly recommend purchasing this film.
B00003CXWV|4.0|I initially had no interest in this film, thinking who wants to see a movie about some two bit dope dealer? My teenage son, however, rented the DVD, and I found myself a captive audience. To my surprise, it was a riveting, well done film. Sure, it was about a two bit dope dealer, but what a story. George Jung, an all American kid from a hard working, hard knocks family, begins dealing marijuana during the 1960s. He develops his business into an empire, and then he decides to branch out into the sexier world of cocaine and really big money. Using his considerable entrepreneurial instinct, he makes a deal with the Columbian drug cartel. Before you know it, he is raking in millions. Unfortunately, the best laid plans often go awry, and there is no fairy tale ending for George. This is a story of hopes, dreams, violence, greed, and betrayal.<br />Well directed by the late Ted Demme, the film is compelling and absorbing as it recounts George Jung's incredible odyssey in the drug trade, tracking the rise of the cocaine industry in the United States, attendant with all its violence. Johnny Depp, in the role of George Jung, makes him into a likable guy who has bitten off more than he can chew, with ultimately dire results. His is a search for the American Dream, a dream that forever remains elusive.<br />Ray Liotta is terrific in the role of George's father, Fred Jung, a sensitive and devoted everyman married to a hard, selfish woman, Ermine Jung, a woman who lacks all motherly instincts and is played with gritty determination by Rachel Griffiths. Jordi Molla is excellent in the role of Diego, George's entre into the world of high stakes, cocaine dealing, and Cliff Curtis is excellent as Escobar, the Columbian drug cartel's main man. Penelope Cruz is terrible as George's beautiful Latina wife, Mirtha. She is simply a bad actress whose English is often unintelligible. With the exception of Ms. Cruz, however, the cast is uniformly excellent.<br />This is the story about a young man who, faced with choices in his life, made the wrong ones and lived to regret it. Johnny Depp captures the pathos of Jung's wasted life. That his characterization is dead on is brought home by Ted Demme's wonderful interview of the real George Jung. This interview is one of the numerous bonus features on this DVD and is well worth watching. It is a poignant interview, as it underscores that Jung's was a life wasted. It also serves to illustrate just how remarkable Depp's characterization of Jung really is. All in all, this is a vibrant, informative, and entertaining film.ng man who, faced with choices in his life, made the wrong ones and lived to regret it.

B000002WYT|5.0|I got Crash because I had heard Dave Matthews perform with the Rolling Stones, and I wanted to hear more. I was very impressed with Crash and have since got another 8 DMB albums. The opening track 'So Much To Say' is great, moving through 'Two Step' and 'Crash Into Me' ensuring a great balance between some fast moving acoustic rock and delicately played ballad. The incredible 'Drive In Drive Out' has got to be one of the best examples of the way the group gel together - everyone gets their own part of the song to show their talent - and when the drummer takes over towards the end of the song the atmosphere is electric. Meanwhile 'Lie In Our Graves' is one of the best acoustically driven funk songs I have heard. This album is probably the best to introduce DMB to new listeners, followed very quickly by the 'Listener Supported [Live]' album which shows the new depths the band take these songs to when performing live!
B00004STW3|4.0|Tim Burton outdoes himself with this silly, but funny, spoof of 1950s flying saucer/alien invasion movies. It is absolutely zany and quite funny. There is also nothing politically correct about it, as there are no sacred cows. The film is totally irreverent of American culture and icons. Everything and everyone is fair game.<br />Martians have come to Earth, and they do not come in peace. Diabolical and deadly, they are bent on wreaking havoc wherever they go with their death ray guns, which serve to incinerate living beings. These bulbous headed martians with their own brand of deadly humour are hell bent on destroying Earth, while laughing and cackling maniacally.<br />The special effects are meant to to be reminiscent of those found in 1950s UFO flicks and in this it certainly succeeds. The cast is stellar with Jack Nicholson playing dual roles, that of President James Dale and that of entrepreneur Art Dale. Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Rod Steiger, Jim Brown, Natalie Portman, Sylvia Sydney, Paul Winfield, Pam Grier, Lisa Marie, Christine Applegate, Lukas Haas, and Tom Jones round out the star studded cast. With tongue in cheek performances, the viewer is bound to get a good laugh out of this film.
B000003BF1|5.0|An absolute incredible album from start to finish with monumental greats Gimme Shelter, Midnight Rambler and You Can't Always Get What You Want [the added gospel chorus at beginning and end was an unexpected compliment to the song  and perhaps a disguised tribute to Brian Jones although in a somewhat eerie sense of the word]. Let It Bleed and Monkey Man over the years became the anthems highly respected for their non-commercialized equally effective genius. Maybe less than standard track numbers included on disc, however the ones that were recorded contained no duration milking or easy talent walkovers. Never could establish in my mind what the cover `cake` sitting on top the spinning L.P. meant but knowing Mick and his goodtime Bad Boys, well, they probably made some fantabulous cuts and ate them too...
0783225857|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I love the great preformeces by all the actors. It is a great follow up to the book or you can say it is a wonderful court-room drama, a picture about the old south, and a coming of age story. While I love this movie there isn't much else on the dvd only a making off. I would love to see a bit more. However it is great piece of any movie collection.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is Britney's best album yet. She mixes a completely new sound with bubble gum pop to make music that you'd only expect from Britney. Britney's ballads are always amazing, but Not a Girl, Not Yet a Women is possibly the best song that she has ever recorded. Britney definitely shows off her lyrical talents throughout the CD. All of the dance songs are unique in their own way; this is a CD that every pop fan should add to their collection. I myself am sick and tired of hearing popstars claims that they have \\"reinvented\\" their sounds on their newest albums, but Britney without-a-doubt transformed her sound into something new, as promised.
0800139151|3.0|THIS WESTERN HAS POTENTIAL, BUT IT NEVER GOT EXPLORED. ....
B000002GYW|5.0|Not only is this the greatest Eagles album ever, it's also the greatest country/rock album ever.  This is the apex of all country/rock compilations.  From beginning to end there is great music along with breath taking lyrics.  The song writing through out this album is unbelievable, especially in &quot;Desperado Reprise&quot; the last song on the album.  &quot;Saturday Night&quot; is one of the greatest country/rock songs ever.  &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; have some of the greatest lyrics ever.  In &quot;Outlaw Man&quot; and &quot;Out of Control&quot; the Eagles show that they can still rock and roll.  This is by far the greatest Eagles album ever!
0060934913|5.0|...but it rings very true. Having spent quite a few years in the restaurant biz (pre-sports biz), I can appreciate the depraved and possibly embellished tales from Mr. Bourdain. His show on Food Network, Cook's Tour, is a favourite, and I am looking forward to the possibility of one day dining in his restaurant. I'm sure he is too.<br />Buy the book - it's a page turner, to coin a phrase.
0451528018|4.0|It was a great book. Sometimes hard to understand, but I stayed up till midnight just to finish it!
B000050XEI|3.0|Well, let's start at the top with the bottom line: if you are a \\"follower\\" of Enya, as a previous reviewer put it, then yes, you have to get this CD. But be prepared to spend a LOT of time getting acquainted with it before liking it. The \\"learning curve\\" for this album is steep, even steeper than that for \\"The Memory of Trees\\" (in fact, \\"Anywhere Is\\" from \\"Trees\\" pretty much characterises the overall sound of \\"Day\\"). The first time I played it, I only played it once, and felt completely let down. I let it gather dust for about eight months, and probably would never have played it again had I not seen the \\"Only Time\\" video and found myself humming the chorus repeatedly over the next few days.<br />The major departure here (and the reason for my initial reluctance to get past the learning curve) is the inclusion of a string section, played pizzicato and used in a very singsong, childlike (almost childISH) manner, giving many of the songs a \\"dee-da, dee-da\\" quality. In fact, Enya actually SINGS words like \\"da-di-da-di-da\\" and \\"dee, da, day\\" on some of the tracks! However, with enough listenings, that majestic, ethereal, other-worldly Enya overdub mystique eventually wins out and pulls you through to the very likeable heart of the songs.<br />The tracks on \\"Day\\" sound more like each other than do the tracks on any previous release, although less derivative of her previous work than other albums, but there are conceptual repeats: the minor-key song that starts out in Latin with a driving cadence and resolves into the tonic major, sometimes in Gaelic, with a weightless, floating quality (\\"Tempus Vernum/Deora Ar Mo Chroi\\" = \\"Cursum Parficio\\" = \\"Pax Deorum,\\" and - to a lesser extent - \\"I Want Tomorrow\\"); the rather stilted, recursive, heavily rubatoed piano solos, usually built around quadruplets (\\"Silver Inches\\" = \\"No Holly for Miss Quinn\\" = \\"From Where I Am\\" = \\"River\\" = \\"Miss Claire Remembers\\" = \\"Portrait\\"); the didactic, half forewarning, half admonition song which walks a fine line between lament and hope (\\"Pilgrim\\" = \\"Once You Had Gold\\" - this is a relatively new genre which has crept into Enya's oeuvre, so there aren't many examples of it...yet); and finally, the self-pitying, lachrimose-bordering-on-schmaltzy paeans lamenting lost loves or lost lives (\\"Fallen Embers\\" = \\"Evacuee\\" = \\"From Where I Am\\" = \\"On Your Shore\\"). This last song type I usually find myself skipping over with the remote, and \\"Fallen Embers\\" is no exception. In fact, the song is so overblown with melodrama that Enya actually allows the emotion to overwhelm her singing, resulting in an incredibly uneven delivery.<br />Despite all these familiar \\"faces,\\" however, the album's shortness precludes the inclusion of (or Enya simply got tired of cannibalizing) a number of other recurring themes. Gone, for example, are the mythic, druidic, mind-bending chants that put Enya on the (pre-\\"Orinoco Flow\\") map in the first place, the mystical, musical prayers to nature that seem to go beyond pop music's bonds and lift the listener into an out-of-body experience. No \\"Aldebarans\\" here, no \\"Lothloriens,\\" \\"La Sonadoras,\\" or \\"Dan Y Dwrs.\\" In fact, there is only one Gaelic language song on the entire album - one wonders if Miss Enya is bending to the pressure of hopelessly vanilla record executives who fear alienating potential new listeners (read \\"consumers\\") with material that is too \\"ethnic.\\" (Note to vanilla record exec types: if you REALLY want to alienate us consumers, make us wait TEN years for the next Enya album, and make sure it's barely 15 minutes long instead of a whole half hour!)<br />Also missing are the fun, bardic, medieval-sounding \\"dance\\" tracks, New Age branles that gave the early albums their Celtic feel, like \\"Bard Dance,\\" \\"Epona,\\" and \\"Ebudae.\\" Nor has Enya included any of the ingenuous, nursery rhyme-style, fable-like songs which make her seem so naïf-like, untouched and untouchable by the modern world; songs like \\"Marble Halls,\\" \\"Fairytale,\\" \\"Shepherd Moons,\\" or \\"To Go Beyond\\" find no place on this album. Instead, Enya has replaced songs of youth with songs of absurdity, letting a baby-talk voice, occasionally childish lyrics, and singsong phrasing do the work of telling us about innocence instead of digging down deep and creating her own musical forms to actually show us that innocence.<br /> Still, a day without \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is...well, like a day without Enya. Even though it's not up to the same standards of excellence, innovation, and exploration as some of her earlier work (I sadly resign myself to never re-experiencing the thrill of getting to know a \\"Watermark,\\" \\"The Celts,\\" or \\"Shepherd Moons\\" for the first time), it's worth having, and you will invariably find yourself humming snatches of these songs as they make themselves at home in your mind and heart. If you want originality and novelty, there are plenty of other artists out there. \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is a family reunion of old friends in new clothes come to call once more. Sure, they may be a little tired, lapsing into the second childhood of old age and looking a bit homogenized from all the inbreeding. But once you get reacquainted, you'll realise how much you missed them. And really, who wants old friends to change all that much anyway?ns,\\" or \\"To Go Beyond\\" find no place on this album.

B000002U8G|5.0|I guess I am just not the typical Pink Floyd fan. I am a music lover, and Pink Floyd just happened to make some pretty damn good music, so I love them, too.<br />When I was a teenager - in the 1970s - I did what all the other &quot;cool&quot; kids did: I bought and listened to Dark Side over and over and over. I hadn't notice Wish You Were Here, but after memorizing Dark side, I realized that my friend had a copy of the recently released Animals. I was in the 9th grade, and I was stunned. Wow, there really is something to this band besides DSOTM. I started investigating, and I did what all serious Floyd fans did: I got my hands on WYH, A Nice Pair, Ummagumma, etc. And then one day I stumbled on Meddle. <br />Now, after 20+ years of listening to music with a critical ear, I have returned to the first band that I was ever passionate about. Why am I writing this review? There are alreay hundreds of them out there, why do we need another one? Because I haven't read one yet that tells the truth. Meddle signals the beginning of the most important period of Pink Floyd music, wherein they had completely grown into a brillaint cohesive band - no longer stumbling and groping, trying to go on without Syd - and released 5 consecutive brilliant albums:<br />Meddle<BR>Obsured by Clouds<BR>Dark Side of the Moon<BR>Wish you Were Here<BR>Animals<br />In fact, I would say that if Pink Floyd had only released those 5 albums, they would still be regarded as the best prog rock band of all time. Those 5 are the reason why, in 50 years, people will still be looking back at this band and saying &quot;They produced quite a wonderful body of work&quot;.<br />There isn't a dud on Meddle. Bracketed by 2 mind blowing treats (&quot;One of These Days&quot; and the masterpiece &quot;Echoes&quot; - perhaps the best song Pink Floyd, or any prog rock band, ever recorded) are three beautiful gems. It may not be obvious to fans of &quot;classical rock&quot; who only know the Floyd that's played on FM radio these days, but these guys knew how to write songs in the traditional sense of the word &quot;songwriter&quot;. (Floyd did start out as a pop band, afterall). Pillow of Winds, Fearless, and San Tropez are gorgeous pop songs, and they telegraph what was to come on Obscured by Clouds.<br />If you really like post-Waters Floyd, and find The Wall to be the greatest record of all time, you probably won't care for Meddle. But, if you are a serious lover of music, you will love it. It is beuatiful.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was the best movie I've seen recently.  The academy award didn't nominate this as best picture. Are they crazy?  Anyways I can't wait till the DVD comes out.  Remember November 15th, 2002 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets comes out! I love this movie.  That's all I have to say.
B000003C2U|5.0|This is one of the best metal albums ever made...<BR>Rest in peace Chuck. You will be remembered forever for extending the boundaries of heavy metal!
B00005RYKU|3.0|I found this movie to be scary, but there was no mystery involved.  I could tell, from the beginning, what was going on.  There is one point in the movie when I thought maybe it was just the girl being suspicious.  It may be too much for soneone who is too sensitive to see children in danger.  It is a fair (in quality) movie.  I have no intention of watching it again.
B000002L9M|5.0|One of the &quot;required&quot; albums from the eighties. It is the start of a new music revolution.
B00004XOWN|4.0|Hot Dog made this whole album worthwhile. I don't know about social commentary or any of that trash, but I do know a good song when I hear one. My friend introduced it to me by blaring it through the 600 watt amp in his truck. <BR>The rest of the album is pretty good, too. It is a cohesive vision. In other words, it's not \\"Let's throw some outtakes, so-so songs, and last-minute takes on a CD. They'll buy it.\\"<BR>The only thing I did not like was the six and a half minute introduction. The rampant cursing didn't phase me a bit. I just wanted those guys to shut up and play something.
B00005BL2A|4.0|A new start and a great album for a group coming off such a messy decade.
0451527046|5.0|This book is great!  I loved how it kept you on the edge of your seat.  If you like adventure books that you never know what is going to happen next, then read this book.  I absolutely loved how Jim did everything that you would never expect.  He just keeps you suprised.  I like how he helps his friends defeat the pirates.  It starts off slow however, but the action heats up in the end.  You absolutely MUST read this book it is the best.  You'll read all the pages in one sitting if you have the chance.  Anyway just read it!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Up until recently I was one of the many 'I hate Britney Spears' lemmings but then I heard 'Overprotected' at the mall and was hooked! I was stuck singing \\"I tell 'em what like,what I want and what I don't and everytime I do I stand corrected\\" and as far as being a Spears hater I stood corrected as well. Spears is not an incredible singer..far from it in fact but she does sound like she had a lot of fun recording the album. Her lyrics have come a long way since she was prancing around singing about being 'Lucky' and has progressed even further from insipid songs like 'Soda Pop'. With this album you will find yourself identifying with lyrics like 'think that I might backdown but I won't /think that you know me now but you don't/ no insecurities won't you just let me ,let me be.' and 'I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe/I'm just trying to find the woman in me/all I need is time a moment that is mine' and other such lyrics along the lines of growing up and learning about oneself. Other songs include the sexy flirtatious 'Boys' and the hit 'Slave 4 U.' The inclusion of 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll' is fun to listen to but could've been left alone (however parents will enjoy the nostalgia,mine do). One of the albums gems is 'What It's Like To Be Me' a rhythmic rocking tune featuring the  writting, vocal and producing talents of Spears' boyfriend Justin Timberlake. The songs that stand out most are 'Overprotected', 'Let Me Be','Boys','I'm Not a Girl,Not Yet a Woman' and 'What It's Like To Be Me.'<BR> Overall the album was much better than what I expected from Spears and is a worthy addition to any pop fans cd collection.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I was a theatre owner in south Florida when this film was released.  The critics tore this film apart, maybe because it wasn't an American film.  I had a 1000 seat house and i paid 45% of the gross to the studio and we made a bundle of money on this film.  Three shows a day for total run of 6 weeks.  If critics read this DO THE MATH!<br />The film is wonderful and is way beyond anything that Hollywood could possibly dream of.  The actors are ALL great and know that acting is far more important than special effects can ever be in a movie.<br />I bought the VHS version some years ago and have now ordered the DVD and i can't wait to see it again.  It's a super good, feel good movie with great music, the audio is well mixed, the colors and costumes are sharp and brillant.  A must see.
B00004T37H|5.0|This is a great movie, a true work of art!  I love this movie, so much that  had to watch it a second time before returning it to Blockbuster!  A must-see for all anime fans.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are not a groundbreaking or world-changing band.  They're just sweet, dirty, simple rock.  With the watered-down rap/rock combos that plague the airwaves nowadays, The Strokes offer something fresh, yet classic(like Velvet Underground, The Stooges and Television, but much more fun). This album is a pleasure from the opening track, to the final note...Short, sweet, and amazing.  No filler. No ten-minute guitar solos. No unnecessary rap verse. Just rock. Easily this album is the best since Nevermind, by Nirvana, and the Strokes are the best band to come out of NYC since the Ramones. Is This It is a must buy and a staple in my car radio.
0618164413|5.0|This book is beautiful.  The paper is high quality and the illustrations are stunning.  The stories are really fun.  The only problem is that several characters in the book (including George the monkey) smoke.  I simply use this as a teaching moment...
6304602979|5.0|WHat can I say about this movie, except fot the fact that its awesome. The genre type of movie sort of lists it in a class with Pulp Fiction meets a Dark love story. I was over my friends house one night and we were just hanging out. We deceided to get a movie and we went with this one. <br />First of all the acting is really well done. The story line revolves around a hooker that falls for a regular guy, and in the process drags all of her dirty laundry into his life. The story is fast paced and interesting.<br />I love movies and this made it into my top ten. This is a fly by gem that seemed never really to have made it. <BR>In my opinion , BUY IT even if your not a movie buff. The Elvis scenes are awesome. Gary Oldman can play any role. In this movie he is a rastifarian pimp. Its halarious. <br />What a great flick. 5 STARS!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Obviously, the people who listed the negative reviews did not give the movie enough time. This was a spectacular movie, including a great soundtrack, and superb acting. The music was inventive and captivating, and I was surprised that both Nicole and Ewan had such remarkable voices. I believe that the movie, actress, actor and director all deserve the amazing credit that they have been given. I am now on my 9th time watching this DVD, and am very happy with all the extras that come with it. For 2001, the movie industry has been blessed with a complete winner.

0446608955|5.0|I saw the movie about two weeks ago and I fell in love with it. After that, I just had to read the book. The book is just as good as the movie, maybe even better. Nicholas Cage is one of the best authors that I have ever read. This is surely a book that you won't want to put down. Read it, and see how touching and wonderful it is for yourself.
B00005T30L|2.0|After seeing that this movie was on Roger Ebert's top 10 of 2001 and hearing about all the other praise from various movie critics, I was really looking forward to renting Ghost World.   I wish I hadn't.   <br />While it might appeal to some individuals who can relate to the awkwardness of trying to fit in with their &quot;conventional&quot; peers, I found this movie a complete bore.   It is very difficult to muster up ANY interest in the main character (and the film itself) as she whines and complains to anyone and everyone about how stupid and &quot;un-hip&quot; everyone is as she proceeds to spew negativity and criticism wherever possible.<br />I would NOT recommend this film (labeled a &quot;comedy&quot; but in the darkest way) if you truly want to care or have any empathy towards the protagonist and the characters around her.
0792151712|2.0|Yes from the moment you hear that the main character's names are 'Jack' and 'Rose' you know this movie is going to be a dilly.<br /> I never saw this film in a theater, I only own the video on two cassetes basically the first cassete is the romance (with the crash coming at the direct end of the first cassette) and the second cassette is 'let's see if we can escape'. <br /> Ok first off this was better then I expected it to be I had heard a lot about this film (in the negative way) and it was a step up from the 0 star film I was expecting. <br /> Ok first off this film has a REALLY old story: Rich girl is engaged to millionaire whom she dosn't love because her mother wants her to marry this guy, on the ship she meets the poor artist who shows her what love really is. Winslet's performance is rather inexperianced but still basically the best preformance in the film, Billy Zane comes over fairly well (at least HE seems to realize how dumb this films is), but Leonardo DiCaprio was your regular pretty boy I mean this guy can REALLY not act, and that awful accent of his. *shudders* 'Ya gotta maake eavery daayy count' I mean gosh that guy is a nut, but obviously he dosn't need to act he can just stand around looking smug and teenage girls swoon at his feet.<br /> A couple of the shots were pretty good, but only a rare few... the shot where Jack teaches Rose to 'fly' was pretty good until the camera starts jerking around to view the scene from a million angles.<br /> The actual crash? Well it was O.K. yeah impressive and all that but if you want an impressive crash scene just delete the rest of the movie/fastforward the rest of the movie and watch the ship crash because honestly you won't find it worth your time to watch the whole thing.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Upon finally watching this movie, I felt like I was seeing the emperor's new clothes.  I had heard all the hype, and was expecting at least an original, interesting experience.  Alas, it was actually painful to watch.  Aside from Nicole and Ewan, who were certainly troupers, and had better singing voices than I expected, the movie was just one long, noisy piece of self-indulgence for the director.
0062502182|1.0|A poor copy of an Arabian Nights story, this book pretends to show how to follow your inner self in  a quest of self discovery. However, the character described is so poorly and superficially constructed, that there can not be any self to be followed and his quest becomes a series of worn out phrases you have read a million times before. Should they be of any use, I doubt the world would still be like this.
630575067X|1.0|when star wars came outin 1977, george lucas it's director was hailed as a genius and a great storyteller. millions of people declared star wars as one of the geatest sci fi movies. these people did not notice how it's creator, george lucas had ripped of his story from tolkein's lord of the rings and akira kurowosa's seven samurai.star wars was followed by two equally good sequels, and george lucas was the golden boy of hollywood. twenty years later when lucas announced that he would be making a new star wars that would tell the origins of his memorable characters, his loyal fans rejoiced. lucas would save sci fi as he did in 77 they thought. little did they notice that lucas had not made a good film since star wars. in 1999 the phantom menance opened worldwide as the most anticipated movie ever. expectations were high as people expected this to be a worthy addition to the famous saga. titanic, which had the current record for highest grossing movie worlwide was expected to be dethrowned by star wars loyal fans.little did the fans notice that it's creator lucas had no one to steal from. what the phantom menance became was one of the worst prequels in cinema history. lucas has lost it his fans declared, but little did they realize that he never had it.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I have never reviewed a movie before, but if i can save someone from seeing this god awful movie, then it is worth it. I was cringing in pain watching it,  Baz Luhrmann should apologize to everyone who saw it, personally. Made me wanna give Battlefield Earth another chance, for your own sake, stay away from it.
B0000399WI|4.0|The Shawshank Redemption was a very strong and powerful movie.  This movie displays one mans triumph (Red, played by Morgan Freeman) of life through finding hope, given to him from a friend(Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins) while they were in jail.  The other main point is about freedom.  Andy demonstrates that freedom is beautiful for being wrongfully accused and finally escaping Shawshank (as well as basically overthrowing it)and living his days out in the tropical sweetness of mexico.  <BR>     Some say this is the best movie ever.  I ,however, disagree. But I can with certainty say that this movie was certainly an amazing movie with an amazing cast and not the least that this movie was only made over a book from one of the best authors on this planet, Steven King.<BR>     If you are looking for a movie with everything, this has it, and although it might seem a little slow at times, you will understanf why in the end.  I highly recommend this film and also recommend that anyone who is slightly interested after reading this check it out.<BR>Bye now, Kyle
B00003CXXP|1.0|Imagine all the above cut to ribbons, covered with ice cold water and stuffed in a food mixer, allowed to dry for three hours and re-stitched together. Well.....that's just about A.I. Spielberg proves what a mess he is capable of making of a poorly realised Stanley Kubrick project adapted from a feeble short story. I like Kubrick and Spielberg has made at least two great films. A.I. doesn't do justice to anyone or anything. All the above films were great and somehow brought freshness to old ideas. This film is a stale hotch-potch of all the above and hasn't an ounce of originality to it.
0783241569|5.0|I am not a big fan of romantic comedies in general, but &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is one of my favorite movies. &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is a love story between travel book store owner, William Thacker played by Hugh Grant, and world famous actress, Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts. There is a special chemistry between Grant and Roberts that I seldom see in modern films. There's a perfect blend of romance and comedy. Rhys Ifans, who plays Thacker's flatmate Spike, adds to the comedy. The soundtrack is also wonderful, and includes the beautiful song, &quot;She&quot;. This movie might have been billed as a &quot;chick-flick&quot; but both my wife and I enjoyed it immensely. &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is highly recommended.
B00005RHGK|2.0|Worthy of a better movie.  In truth, it is the ending that salvages anything from this rather juvenile, campy piece.  The ending is daring and perfect, hinted at by the DVD cover.  Not worth watching more than once, and even once is barely worth it.  This movie is not for the queasy, but it is in no way scary.  It's cheesy.
B00005TT77|5.0|I grew up in 60's, the Beatle were a part of my life.  To me, they were the timeless spirit of music itself.  This album reflects that spirit - those themes that don't die.  I am happy to see them embraced in the voice of these times.  All the enduring classics have been reborn again and again since the time of Mozart; this is an album of case in point.
B00000064G|5.0|this is an amazing album!  and you should buy it!  no you really should!  i found out about nick drake through the net and so decided to buy pink moon with it being his supposed best and the last album he recorded before his death.  i now own pink moon and bryter layter and i do prefer pink moon cos its so simple!  just him and a guitar, piano and a recording dude!  all the songs on the album are beautiful!  i normally come home after buying an album and try to listen all the way through without any distractions, i managed this about 3 times with this album!  one because of the length of the album (cant remember exactly how long, but around about 25-30 mins i think) and because its so bloody good!  i didn't know whether i would like it cos folk isn't really my 'thing' i like mr. bungle & guns n' roses etc. but i still loved it!  i mean i dont only listen to one kind of music i do listen to a broad range of musical styles, but this album is like nothing else i own (apart from obviously bryter layter!).  anyway i dont know what else to write!  if you like folk then buy, if you like listening to depressed guy's with a guitar then buy, or if you need some music that is 'real' then buy!  so buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyyyyyy it my friend!
0790749815|5.0|Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill has one of those in Alfred Hitchcock's renowned thriller. In twenty-four hours, he has been kidnapped, mistaken for another man, intoxicated with alcohol and arrested for drunk driving and assaulting an officer. To top it off, he is framed for murder, which leads to a nationwide search. Let's also not forget when he is attacked by a cropdusting plane. Throw in a dangerous villain (James Mason) and his mistress (Eva Marie Saint), superb direction from Hitchcock (Who makes a brief cameo in the film's beginning) and an exciting Bernard Hermann music score, you have yourself quite a ride. The movie has several clichés that were later exhausted in other movies, but that doesn't detract from the fun. <br />Considering that it is bargain priced, the DVD of \\"North by Northwest\\" is a great buy. The film is presented in a Widescreen Anamorphic transfer that's so well done its almost impossible to tell that it is over forty years old. But the extras are really what set this above. \\"Destination Hitchcock\\", hosted by Eva Marie Saint, is a documentary about the making of this movie featuring interviews with Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and screen writer Ernest Lehman (Who also does an audio commentary). A theatrical trailer, a \\"Hitchcock Trailer\\", a TV spot, a photo gallery, cast and crew bios and an isolated version of Hermann's music score complete this excellent package. <br />Whether you are a fan of one of the stars or of Hitchcock, admire great films or just like entertaining movies, \\"North by Northwest\\" should be added to your personal library. <br />Favorite quote:<BR>\\"I have two ex-wives, a mother and several bartenders depending on me.\\"<BR>-Roger Thornhill
B00005OM4N|4.0|This cd was good. I never really liked Britney Spears. I always thought that she was a another cheezy popstar with a smile dripping artificial sweetener.  But this cd has some hard core songs on it. You can tell that she wants to break out of the mold she set for herself when she first came on the scene. Britney is so much more real now, and it comes through in her music. This isn't the bubblegum pop that we're used to from her. It's her pain, rage, happiness, and distress all rolled up into one. If anything you could get a little tired of hearing how stressful her life is when to the naked eye she seems to be living a dream...but you get to know where she's coming from. My advice to you is to borrow the album from someone, cause it may grate on your nerves a little...but you may LOVE it.
B000000W5L|3.0|Well, you may think that I am crazy, but I am not. I love classic rock, Hendrix, Beatles and all that stuff. I like the Stones too, but I can't enjoy this record! Yeah, Keith plays great, it has good songs, it's bluesy, powerful, but something in it is wrong. I don´t like the mix. The voices, the instruments, the sounds are a mess. So, every time i sit and say: \\"ok, this time I will enjoy\\", I feel very uncomfortable, having the feeling that something's not working. I put three stars only because I recognize that is classic.
B000003Z6I|4.0|If the phrase &quot;atonal funk/blues caterwalling&quot; sparks your interest, this is the CD for you. The Bads Seeds are excellent players who understand how important silences are to raising an unholy din. Cave sings with complete disregard for sounding pretty but can't help being musical (he has a strong, clear voice with an impressive range.) The lyrics range from stunning (&quot;Saint Huck&quot; is flat-out brilliant) to evocative to sometimes just melodramatic. <br />The original songs are strong enough, in fact, that the two covers are the weakest parts of the CD. &quot;In The Ghetto&quot; sounds like it was done on a bet to gain pop-radio play, but it does give you a chance get up and go to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. &quot;Avalanche,&quot; starting the set, is more of a problem - this isn't one of Cohen's best lyrics, and Cave and the band sound restricted by the simplistic melody.<br />Nearly five starts, though, for the rest of the set (even for the unnecessary repeat of the title song, which at least reminds me of one of my favorite films). I may never have another Nick Cave recording, but I'm glad to have this one.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I think that this movie has a great plot and just because it is primarily based on drugs people judge this movie completely the wrong way.  I did give it five stars but that doesn't mean its like the best movie I've ever seen cause there is alot of movies that I would five stars to for what ever I think that they are great for but BLOW has a great messege and after reading a lot of other reviews I came to the conclusion that there are a lot of people who don't know what their talking about.
0440217563|5.0|One thousand words is  not enough to describe the intoxicating writing of this author.  I stummbled upon Voyager by accident and was gripped by its pages the moment I began to read it.  Jamie is a character worth falling in love with and Claire is a woman worth being with.  <br />There was nothing about this book that I didn't like, only that it had to end.  Thank goodness Diana Gabaldon saw to this dilema and wrote Drums of Autumn.
0446677450|1.0|The entire premise of this book is flawed.  Getting rich the easy way and spending lots of money are a hook and bait used to lure people into bad schemes.<br />Robert Kiyosaki's philosophy of 'get rich quick' and pushing the spend big lifestyle are foolish.
B00005LB50|4.0|Before this box set came out, I bought the original CD releases to replace my worn out vinyl. Then the first two albums were released with HDCD remastering, which I had to get. I was really disappointed to discover that the first two albums appear on this box set again. At least there are a lot of great demos and alternate mixes of songs from \\"Last Time Around\\". I wish they had included some live rarities, but everything in the box set sounds great remastered in HDCD.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I remember getting this disc as a birthday present the year it came out. Much like the cover artwork, at first it seemed weird and too jumpy, but after repeated listens, it all started to fall in place.<br />While I'm admittedly not the biggest Pearl Jam fan out there, my comments may seem a bit worthless to bigger fans, But...this album is a masterpiece. It's dark, moody, eerie, ambient, reflective, searching, brutal and peaceful all at the same time, which leads me to some degree to believe that this is Pearl Jams's biggest artistic statement. It starts with the quiet, dark and ambient Sometimes. Then it bursts into the explosive Hail, Hail, which is followed by the hypnotic, middle-eastern Who You Are, which features an elf-like choir sound brought on by the vocal overdubs. It's weird but excellent. In My Tree is hard to describe actually, but it's somewhat catchy and groovy. Smile is a mid-tempo rocker. Off He Goes is a slow, dark, quiet and reflective piece with some poignant lyrics. Habit is a brutal rocker about drug addiction, if I'm not mistaken. Red Mosquito has a Neil Young type feel to it, which is bluesy/country-esque and heavy. Lukin is a 1 minute rocker with Eddie Vedder growling at super speed, which makes it hard to understand what he is saying, check out some websites to get the lyrics. Present Tense starts out slow and absorbing, then turns into a musical assault. Mankind is another heavy rocker, this time out, it's sung by Stone Gossard, which I rather like. He sounds like Ed Roland of Collective Soul. I'm Open is like a poetic number. Musically it's dark, ambient and somewhat new age-esque. Love the chant \\"I'm Open, \\"I'm Open\\". Around The Bend is an acoustic, peaceful number to end out this spectacular disc. This is an excellent, musically transcendent disc. Highly recommended to music lovers with a sense of adventure, space, mood, reflection and introspection.
B0000039PW|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album is one of the few hip hop albums that can be considered timeless.  While it didn't sell as much as the massive Life Ater Death (which is a classic to its credit), it is a much better album.<br />There are so many classic songs and quotes throughout this amazing album to even name.  Doing a track by track review of the album would be pointless, since every song can only be described in one word: unbelievable.  What makes this album so great is how it blends some of the best street tales ever with phenomenal party songs.  This is what makes Biggie the best MC ever; his uncanny ability to make classic albums that appeal to the masses.  The only rapper that can come close to him in that category is 2Pac.<br />In the end, Ready To Die is placed in the same category as Illmatic, 36 Chambers, and Cuban Linx as the best revolutionary debut albums ever in hip hop.  Along with Life After Death, it is the blueprint for what hip hop albums are today: mix some street songs with party songs and you'll have a successful album.  Unfortunately nobody has ever been able to match any of Biggie's albums in that respect.
B00000JSJC|2.0|This was a sub-par bit of sci fi that recycles the 'future is desolate' idea of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and the 'wouldn't it be interesting to explore the thoughts and experiences of someone else?' idea of Dreamscape. People in a gloomy almost Y2K LA jack into other people's lives. A couple of the life experiences available for public consumption turn out to be killings. The talented actors waste a lot of time flailing around trying to figure out among other thing who the killer is.<br />The voyeuristic... murder mystery portion of the plot is an interesting idea but so it's cluttered with a bunch of cheap false leads and worse Ray Fiennes character mooning over Juliette Lewis as to kill the story idea. The actors do their best and the special effects are little more than good film editing. Mostly it's a way to [spend] two hours but you can definitely get better science fiction for your money.
B00003CXXS|5.0|The Jurassic Park trilogy started in 1993 with the first movie directed by Steven Spielberg. In 1997, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, sequal followed which was also directed by Steven Spielberg. Then in 2001 the movie continued with more action and more dinosaurs then ever. Jurassic Park 3, however, was not directed by Steven Spielberg who decided to produce it but directed by Joe Johnston. This sequal provides more action than the first two movies. Also the dinosaurs in it are more realistic and more dangerous than ever before. The special effects are also much better.<br />Jurassic Park 3 satrts off with a boy and his step-father parasailing off the coast of Isla Sorna, the island on which The Lost World takes place. After going through some fog the parasailers look down out the friends on the boat but all they see is smeared blood over the side of the boat. They start to panic. They look ahead and see that the boat is going to crash into some rocks so the father cuts the rope and they head to the island. <br />The movie then cuts to Dr. Grant who was is the first one. He is talking to his friends who is played by Laura Dern(they both come back after staring in the first one together). As the story goes on Dr. Grant encounters a adventure seeking couple(played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni). They want Dr. Grant to be their tour guide as they fly over Isla Sorna. Dr. Grant says no but then they offer to pay him as much as he wants, so he agrees to go.<br />Along with him Dr. Grant takes his friend Billy along with him. When they arrive at the island they fly above it for a while and then tell the captain to land. Dr. Grant then yells in protest. He tells them they canno land on this island because it is too dangerous. They then punch him and he becomes unconcious. When he wakes up he hears the wife yelling a name. When he asks what she is doing they say that it was their that was one of the parasailers. She keeps yelling and he tells her to stop because itss a bad idea. Then they hear giant footsteps. Uh-oh! THey all run into the plane and start it. They go down the run way when one of the piolets runs out of the woods telling them to stop and get him. Knowing they can't they keep going. All of a sudden a dinosaur runs out and eats him justs as the plane lifts off. The dinosaur then makes the plane go into the woods and it crashes. Then the dinosaur appears and reaches into the cockpit and eats one of the piolets. THe dinosaur then kicks the plane and it starts to roll. Then the dinosaur, getting fed up runs away, and the passengers get out. <br />The action continues and the suspense grows. I don't want to give away the rest of the movie because I think you should enjoy the excitment. Go out and buy this movie because you will be absolutly pleased with your choice.
B000003TA4|5.0|I always liked Nirvana and Kurt Cobain. They made an 'alternative' version of heavy metal-meets punk-meets pop to an extent. It was such a tragic story for Kurt. A nice, compassionate and troubled man who probably deserved more than what he got. Anyway, this disc is excellent and well known by many. It's dark, aggressive and somewhat trippy. Of course it has \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" \\"In Bloom,\\" and the creepy \\"Come As You Are.\\" But it also has melodic noise rockers like \\"Breed\\" and \\"Territorial Pissings.\\" The dark, murky and watery \\"Drain You\\" and the raw, angst-ridden energy of \\"Lounge Act.\\" It also has the punk-meets-pop of Stay Away. \\"On A Plain\\" is somewhat pessimistic lyrically, but the ummm-mmmmmm melody is intoxicating. \\"Something In The Way\\" is probably the most underrated gem on here. It's somewhat dark, yet haunting, melodic and simple. The hidden track (which I only recently found out was on 'certain' discs) is called \\"Endless, Nameless.\\" It starts at 13:51, and is mostly a noise rocker with de-tuned strings and destruction at the end.<br /><br />If anyone's interested in sampling an infinitely important and influential piece of what was considered \\"grunge\\", this album should be owned.
0440219078|5.0|Imagine a life void of color, of music, of emotion- a life without all elements that give beauty to the world. In The Giver, Lois Lowry creates such a life in a fictional utopian community. The plot follows the main character Jonas's coming-of-age as he realizes the possibilities of a life beyond his controlled world of black-and-white, of good and bad. Though the characters' lifestyle is so different from our own, the reader is able to sympathize with the confusion felt by this adolescent boy, who truly `knows no better'. <br />Lowry's style of writing draws the reader's attention, and as each chapter ends the reader is left yearning for more. Though initially seeming far-fetched, ultimately the plot has an eery possibilty. Could we really be lead to a life of Sameness?<br />Lowry's novel is a must-read for all ages.
0792841859|4.0|This film deals with an event that is absolutely essential in 1956 and for our history. Three civil-rights-militants are killed by a local group of KKK members led by a deputy sheriff in some country in Mississippi. The FBI is called into the investigation, eventually finds the bodies, but a wave of violence is unleashed on the county, mainly against blacks. The historical question is to know whether the FBI involvement was decided to curtail the surging civil-rights movement or to encourage it. The main question is whether this civil-rights movement could be contained or if it was the expression of a deep contradiction in the American society that had come to the point of ripening that made it unavoidable, invincible. The film does not answer those two questions, and actually does not give a proper image of the FBI efforts. It is too quick and too superficial. But it shows the impact of such an event on the American psyche. For the first time in history several Klan members were arrested, tried and convicted of murders and other crimes with extremely strict sentences, even if for those crimes in some other conditions the sentences would have been a lot heavier including the death penalty. That was a no-return point that contained in itself the registration of Blacks on the voting lists and the victory of Kennedy some time later. After this event the American society could only move towards a multiracial democracy, even if there were some setbacks, assassinations and other terrorist attacks, and if it was delayed along the way. The key was contained in this particular event : the alliance between the Blacks and some progressive Whites. When this alliance became strong enough to impose its voice to be listened to, progress became irreversible. 1956 was an essential year in the history of the US, just as it was an essential year in the history of the Soviet Union and East-European countries. It was an essential year when democracy became something finally true for everyone. And it will take more that forty years for this to start becoming true all over the world. The task is not yet finished.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUryone. And it will take more that forty years for this to start becoming true all over the world.

B00005RHGK|3.0|Much of the way through this, I thought I was seeing one of my new favorite horror films. It was edge-of-your-seat excitement. I thought They hadn't made much of anything like this in years, and I was reminded of good old days of suspenseful horror. Too bad the ending was a real let down. In fact, I scarcely remember how it came out. Maybe it's best to watch and enjoy the main body of the film and then dream up your own ending. If you're at all imaginative, you'll come up with an improvement.
B0000035E7|5.0|bleach is the one album by nirvana that you should stand by if you are a true fan, because it is cobain at his best. not neccessarily the music(which is also great), his thoughts were completely unaffected by fame on this album, because he had written it long before. his thoughts and poetic words are truly inspiring.<BR>*peace,love,&amp; empathy*
0790738139|5.0|Modern film-noir about three cops investigating a murder at a coffee shop are intertwined in a situation far more complex than they were led to believe.  Brilliant thriller has it all: mystery, suspense, action, romance, humor, drama, and it's all placed into one ingenious, engrossing mix in the hands of director Curtis Hanson.  Hands down the best film of its genre and one of my personal favorites.  The three leads (Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey) deliver sharp, terrific performances.  Excellent score from Jerry Goldsmith.
B0000027RL|5.0|I was at first, not 100% sure with Pearl Jam. My good friend played me No Code, and I liked Lukin, because of it's sheer energy, but I was not sure about Ed's voice. I grew to love it though, and so i bought the debut Ten.<br />Opening up with Once, I was interested, because I have the EU version with Mike playing an intro, which was very Henrixy. I like the song, but it's not amazing. Even Flow however is a true great. The melody is hard hitting and Dave Krusen on drums adds emphasis amazingly to Vedders lyrics about homelessness. Followed by Alive, the most popular P.J song - apparently - is great, and the opener to Mamasan, along with Once and ending with Footsteps (unreleased) the song brings Vedder's past into the fray, although then branching into reality, Eddie sings with great passion. Why Go is a great song, not giving time between Alive to stop and think. Black I find unfogettable, but it si good live. The Jeremy, a great song, with a very sad and true background. The whole band work in unison to provide a true masterpiece. Oceans again is not great, but Porch is a great song, bringing the Punk element into Pearl Jam, with Stone's infuence clear. Garden is my favourite track on the album, amazing melody, and inspiring lyrics, &quot;I will walk with my hands bound. I will walk with my face blood&quot;. Deep is great for grunge, an amazing solo at the start. Release is Eddies way of talking to his father (dies when he was 13 - Alive), and so is difficult to appreciate unless your a hardcore Pearl Jam fan. Dirty Frank on the EU version was written with Kleidis and Flea from RHCP and show's Stone's funk roots, a great track. <br />I love Ten, but I prefer Vs. on the whole, but in all fairness, State of Love and Trust should replace Oceans, but it is the best debut album I have ever heard. Here's to the new album in 2002 which the boys began recording in February. HAIL HAIL Pearl Jam
0571212689|5.0|Any animator looking for a book to help them improve their craft knows that most books on animation usually fall short in so many ways, it's easy to think it's impossible to write a comprehensive and accurate book on the subject (don't even get me started about the abysmal state of computer character animation books). Williams is the penultimate animator's animator and he tells it like it is. Williams systematically demystifies virtually every aspect of animation from simple walk cycles, to breaking joints to dialogue and acting. Along the way, he corrects or eliminates information that is inaccurate or practices that distract (lose the headphones and the rad tunes when you work and watch your quality and quantity improve). Williams also is a great storyteller and writer. His accounts with Milt Kahl, Art Babbit and Ken Harris are gems, giving real insight into the personalities of these ingenious men. Since so much of the book is gleaned from his tutaluge under the now-gone \\"greats\\" of animation, any price for this tome is a steal. His gift to the world is this book. <br />If you want learn to REALLY animate characters with life and believability, get this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was a sceptic guy, thinking this movie would be bad when i sat down to watch it.  Shockingly i was blown away by the Moulin Rouge.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman where phenominal.  i am buying this DVD now.  Plus the Added Music Video, The &quot;Come What May&quot; remix is awesome.  All in All a great buy
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I read these reviews before deciding if I wanted to buy the soundtrack to this absolutely enchanting movie! I must say I was a bit discouraged by such negative comments but I was not discouraged enough! I bought the CD the following day and I absolutely love it! All of the songs are on the movie--whether part of the backround music or the actual songs sung by Ewan and Nicole. Yes, some songs are not included but the songs that are included are great. Hopefully, the second CD will contain the missing songs. So I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who loved the movie and absolutely loved the music! My favorite track is El Tango De Roxanne! Such emotion!

B00004TH7Z|4.0|I've been a fan of Iron Maiden for some time now, and naturally I could not wait to hear what the highly acclaimed new album would sound like.  I was excited to hear that Bruce and Adrian were back, and I just knew this was going to be their best album for quite some time.  Personally, I did not like any of the albums that they made after \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\", no matter what, I could not find anything good about them at all.  So, this album was a godsend.  This is, without a doubt, their best for some time.  Very epic, very melodic, and very well-made.  There are songs that recall the glory days (\\"Wicker Man\\", \\"Fallen Angel\\") and more experimental tracks that show they have branched out (\\"Nomad\\", \\"Dream of Mirrors\\"), just a well-made album.  However, it is not perfect.  For one thing, it's a bit too long, and some of the songs just plod on, when they should simply just end.  Also, the guitar solos are easily their least impressive (where is Dave Murray in all this?  His amazing solos are nonexistent!).  That, and the signature \\"Maiden harmonics\\" are nowhere to be found.  Where are those great guitar flourishes that made songs such as \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" so amazing?  Oh well, I guess I shouldn't complain.  I'm just happy to see an album like this come out in this day in age.  <BR>UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!
0345440900|5.0|Before reading this book I was struggling every day to try and get my boys on some sort of a schedule but was having no success.  Most of the books that I've read are too restrictive to apply to twins and none address the issue of understanding your baby's cues as thoroughly as this book does.  Within three days of reading the book and applying some of methods the twins are regularly napping, sleeping longer through the night AND waking up happy!  Tracy emphasizes treating your baby with respect and tells you exactly how to communicate effectively in a gentle and manageable way.  If you are only buying one book about getting your child to nap, eat, play, and sleep through the night, this is the one.
B00004T40X|4.0|Now, of course, when I say this, I am not counting Iced Earth, Iron Maiden, or Blind Guardian as power metal, even though they often (unfairly I might add) fall into that category.  To me, power metal is a cheesy, overglossed, annoying display of musical indulgence by musicians who don't even posess the level of talent they flaunt.  But, somehow, this band manages to be different.<br />After listening to my friend's copy of this CD (with great hesitation, I might add), I find that this is a surprisingly good CD.  The songs are meaningful, catchy, and the musicians play very well.  The drummer is indeed very talented, and he does a lot of technical and rhythmic drumwork, as opposed to the mindless snarefests of the average power metal band.  The guitarist is a bit reckless at times, but he knows what he's doing, and he does it well.<br />But, that's not to say this album isn't without its flaws.  The vocals can be a bit goofy in times, due to the fact that the singer is not so comfortable with English.  That, and the lyrics can be a bit much as well.  &quot;Letter to Dana&quot; is almost enough to make you lose your lunch.  Generally speaking, the lyrics are head and shoulders above that of the average power metal band, but still they are not perfect.  But, since I don't generally pay too close attention to lyrics, that's a minor complaint.<br />I guarantee that no matter what you like, you will probably enjoy this album.  This comes from a person who would rather slam his hand in a car door than listen to Rhapsody or Stratovarius.  If you are a fan of the genre, this is a definite must-have.
B00000721J|1.0|Wow, is this bad.  Astoundingly amateurish, McCartney indicates that Paul was not serious at this time about a solo album.  It is crammed with trifling instrumentals (Kreen-Akore--what in the world?) and but a handful of decent songs, That Would be Something, Every Night, Junk, Teddy Boy and Maybe I'm Amazed.  But even these songs are spoiled by their sloppy arrangements.  Macca did better versions of That Would be Something and Every Night (and the instrumental Junk) on his Unplugged album in 1991, and the live version of Maybe I'm Amazed is superior to the one here, which just fades out inconsequentially at the end.  I love Ram, Band on the Run, even London Town, but Macca's debut solo album is perhaps the biggest waste of my money on a CD ever.  I can't for the life of me understand the popularity of this album, then or now, unless it's the photos of a hunky, bearded Macca in bathing trunks (But Macca why that pic of you with your finger up your nose--ugh!!).  In short, I want my money back!!!  If you have any sense, buy Ram instead.  It's great.
6305076626|3.0|I honestly enjoyed this picture.  It ain't great cinema, but it's worth the viewing.   Since they don't make musical movies, anymore, \\"Rocky Horror\\" should be treasured as one the few existing \\"rock musical\\" films and if the music in the film weren't so catchy, I'd probably dislike this film altogether.   Yet it's funny, spoofing science fiction B-movies and becoming one itself.  Tim Curry IS Dr. Frank N Furter, and I'd have a hard time imagining that role to someone else.  This film is so weird, it's bad and so bad it's good.   Transylvania awaits you.....
B000009QPK|5.0|This live album is pure energy. It really is what the title suggests, a whole decade of aggression compressed into two convenient discs. How awesome is that! This album came out at just the right time. It contains songs from Show No Mercy through Seasons In the Abyss. If it came earlier, the selection would'nt be as diverse, and if it came out after another album was released, it would contain newer stuff that isn't as good. (In my opinion). Well if you have it, enjoy! and if you don't, what the hell are you doing READING about stuff so cool? You should be listening to it instead!
B00003CXC7|5.0|I've wavered on this over the years. First Rear Window. No, Vertigo. North By Northwest. Psycho. Now back to Rear Window. And I credit the new DVD release with its excellent documentary feature. All the discs in this series are excellent.
6305728437|5.0|Mulan was a really good movie.  Mulan had to do some quick thinking when Shang asked her what her name was. She said her name was Ping.  The songs were really good, my favorites were Reflection, True to Your Heart and Be a Man.  This is almost as good as Balto or Oliver and Company.  This a really good movie.
0452282152|5.0|I really liked the book, because it made me understand the melancholic smile on the girl's face and left me with silent questions to think about for days.<BR>The &quot;simple&quot; writing style of Ms. Chevalier got lots of criticism, that I can only explain with the non-understanding of the era, the culture 300 years ago, the protestant Puritanism, and the way Vermeer worked (which was as well a reflection of his time). This novel gives a good view of the 17th century Holland (not Sweden as some readers assumed) and the language of the book just ads to it. <BR>It is not action but emotion packed, and probably you need to slow down to the speed of these days to realize that. <BR>The Girl with a Pearl Earring is written the way Vermeer painted her beauty and grace. You can not compare with the tension you find on a tortured Modigliani face, but then read a book of his life and you get all the screaming and shouting you miss from that book.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is to Sgt. Pepper what De Niro's Vito Corleone is to Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone.
B000059XUP|2.0|While the gothic and gritty image remain intact, the story line is too watered down and fails to connect on an emotional level.  Unlike the original Crow, City of Angels just feels flat all around.  The culprit here is the stale script and monotonous acting.  Though my opinion differs from the vast majority of reviewers, I thought the bright spot of the film was Perez.  I thought his manic portrayal of a father returned to avenge his childs death was right on the money.  The movie is a bust, but not entirely unbearable.
079284209X|4.0|A karate person has the stance of a martial artist and that is the stance that Sean Bean has in this film as \\"Spence\\" who is a vital part of the \\"hit\\" team, he is the weapons specialist, he is calm, says nothing, stays alone, and is questioned by the other members of the team if he is a \\"real\\" guns specialist, and does not belong to SAS. Spense does not take kindly to the choice of weapons that they would like him th use,and he does another weapon hidden in his coat pocket, he knows that he is being set up, and does what is called \\"protect\\" the other members of the team. He leaves silently the next day paid off. He is a character that you have questions about. Its Sean Bean as a terrorist, and rogue samurai, one who peddles his skills for hire, and then moves on to another job. Its Spence the way he should be played. Calm, professional and yes, he is real, he is not a \\"fake\\" which is what the other members of the team want him to admit. Its an intense role for Sean to play, its a very serious role, and its too brief. He does his job with the stance of a martial artist, meets his opponents, and then is released as a team member. He is a man who works well alone, his character needs to live by his wits, and alone, and that is what you do not see him do in Ronin. You see him question the authority of the other team members. Its Sean Bean at his best, and yes it you would like to find out more about Sean, I have the Sean Bean Club on Yahoo, and yes we have been on the net for a little while, but we run an immaculate club, because Yahoo has children on the clubs as well as adults. Ronin is not for some viewers, but if you like DeNiro and Bean together you will enjoy this film!
B00003CXA2|5.0|You can't go wrong with a Tom Hanks movie under just about any conditions, but this one really shines.  The special effects, the history, the music, Tom's performance and an excellent supporting cast make this audio-visual perfection.  Throw in a little love for the women and some war scenes for the guys and there's definitely something for everyone.
B000002UAS|5.0|Probably not there best or most interesting album; Sgt Peppers and The White Album win those accolades in my humble opinion, but without doubt the single most important purchase a Beatles fan can make. Essential because it's there most transitional piece and captures the group shedding their teenybopper image and taking more risks with their music to create something very special indeed. In this sense it's the most \\"Beatley\\" Beatles album by juxtaposing the traditional structures of their early work with experimental forrays without becoming too overindulgent (no Revoultion 9 here thank goodness) in the process. A fine example of this is the albums' opening track Taxman. Harrisons motownesque riff that drives the track echos<BR>Day Tripper from the previous album yet when with the inspired sitar-like backward guitar party crashes the middle eight, well you can see why Brian Wilson had good reason to be worried. It's also probably their most eclectic work as well from the child like innocence of Yellow Submarine, the Bacharachian Good Day Sunshine, to the psychedelic swirl of Tommorow Never Knows nearly all styles of popular music are broached here par excellence. <br />The majority of the tracks here are Mc Cartneys and Eleanor Rigby is just the most quintesential bittersweet pop song and one of the best he's ever written. The lyrics read without the songs lush orchestral backing standup on their own as a fine poem \\"Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in a church were a wedding has been, lives in a dream. Waits at the window, wearing a face that she keeps by a jar by the door, who is it for?\\". <br />As always though it's Lennon contributions that really steal the show. His signature nasal rasp comes out perfectly on the dreamlike I'm Only Sleeping. A hippie anthem of sorts, with it's melancholy descending chords, and well placed somnolent sound effects, a finely crafted pop song. And Your Bird can Sing is pop perfection and may arguably be the most melodic song ever created bar none. It's hard to believe that the Tommorow Never Knows closing track was made over thirty five years ago. The way the bombastic drums and bassline interact over Lennons spaced out vocal delivery make it sound almost like a contemporary dance song. Though having said that it's still sounds a good ten years ahead of it's time. <br />A year or so later the band went on to create Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club band, instigate a counter cultural revoultion (The Summer Of Love) and change the face of popular music as we know it. Not suprising then that is probably there most over looked work, but an enduring masterpiece just the same.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies of all time!  It's got the dry British humour, drama, great music (most by T Rex) and dancing.  I hope that last part doesn't turn off the guys, it's a great movie.  My significant other is about as masculine as they come and he liked it too.
B000002BQK|5.0|After purchasing this album I knew quickly that this is one of the best albums in the history of r&amp;b music! Mariah's voice was restrained well and displayed more than enough emotion! In one word, AMAZING. Christina,Britney,Jessica,Mandy could NEVER come close to making such a remarkable and breathtaking piece of art.
B00005KA9G|5.0|Any woman who has been to see male strippers will find this movie hilarious.  It follows a bunch of unemployed average guys trying to make an extra buck by stripping.  I've seen both the movie and the live stage show and the movie is much better.

B00005JKQX|3.0|Walking into the theatre I had some reservations about 'A Beautiful Mind'. I was worried that it would be a sappy, self serving retelling of real historical events (lets not forget U571) But my fears were dissolved after the first ten minutes.<br />So, is 'A Beautiful Mind' the year's best film? Perhaps not. This has been a fabulous year for films with 'Fellowship of the ring', 'In the bedroom', 'Iris', 'The man who wasn't there' and 'Training day' to name a few. However I was suprised by the fabulous performance Russell Crowe gave as the film's protagonist John Forbes Nash Jr. Last year I was a little let down by the academy awards. I felt the 'Gladiator' probably did deserve best picture, or course with 'Almost Famous' running a close second. However I did think that Crowe's best actor oscar was a little over the top.<br />This year though I have decided to do a complete 180, I do not in fact think that 'A Beautiful Mind' deserves to be the best picture, but Russell definately deserves an Oscar for best actor (far be it from me to say Kevin Spacey is not deserving for 'The Shipping News'<br />Crowe's performance is sintilating, and nothing the audience has ever seen before. A brash, macho figure playing a real life character with real frailties. And yes on occasion a sly laugh has to go out as to how ripped Crowe is for being a mathematician.<br />The film is great however...a strange hodge-podge of mystery, intrigue with a well presented love story inserted. Like Crowe's success in 'Glaldiator', 'A Beautiful Mind' is indeed an epic that follows the follies of one man in his exploration of himself to absolve his dillusions. <br />Ron Howard's directing is masterful, however I must question his choice of pacing in the film. I felt like the latter parts of Nash's life were rushed through a little too much and the setting up of his character was a little too lengthly from the outset. This gave me the feeling of two seperate films, linked only through common characters. <br />As far as the costume and make-up go the results are flawless. The costume changes make it quite evident to the viewer the time period in which the characters are living in. And through make-up their aging process is affirmed with spectacular results.<br />Overall 'A Beautiful Mind' in my mind (forgive the pun) is not the years best film... it is fantastic however and is well worth the money to only go and see Crowe deliver a tour-de-force performance that is rivaled by very few this season.<BR>I would give this film a solid 3 and a half stars
B00005U122|5.0|I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this concert video.  Between this and Pink Floyd's PULSE, I couldn't be happier...<br />Seeing and listening to IN THE FLESH brought back wonderful memories.  It was interesting to hear how different the arrangements were on a few Pink Floyd standards.  While I may prefer Gilmour's guitar playing (who wouldn't?) and Pink Floyd's arrangements of several of these numbers, Roger still made them interesting enough for me to sit up and take notice.  And let's face it.  Roger's material is pretty strong stuff.  Granted, he seems to be in a 60s/70s rut of sorts (still bashing the establishment, still ranting about war), but it doesn't make it any less powerful.<br />My favorite part of the entire concert was when Roger played music from AMUSED TO DEATH.  His mixing of old material and his \\"newer\\" stuff was spot on and his backup musicians and singers were, for the most part, excellent (I immediately noticed Jon Carin -- a wee bit older looking from the 1994 PULSE concert).  It is very evident from this dvd that Roger Waters (like David Gilmour and Pink Floyd) knows how to put on a concert...<br />So if you are thinking about purchasing this dvd, do NOT hesitate.  It makes a great addition to your library and a wonderful companion (and comparative) piece to PULSE.  There is also some interesting (but not enlightening) back-stage preparations on this dvd.  Between 1 and 10, IN THE  FLESH gets a 9.  Like PULSE, it's not quite perfect (some arrangements were a bit muddied), but as near to perfect as one could hope for in a live concert.
0790729725|4.0|Arguably Martin Scorsese is the most underrated director in Hollywood. No matter how good the films are this man makes the academy always overlooks him for the best director award.<br />Goodfellas is another film in a long line where this was the case. The direction in this film is fantastic and the foresight it took to frame some of the shots in the film (namely the car boot scene) are fabulous.<br />The film centres around organised crime as many of Scorsese's films do, but there is something about the characters that make them endering.<BR>They're the kind of characters that the viewer doesn't want to be caught, we get to know them so well even though their motivations are so stilted we don't want them to lose. We get to know the charactersfrom early on as we follow the gang from their petty theivery to plane heists.<br />The cast are great Liotta is sparkling, Pesci although always playing very similar characters is great (if it 'aint broke, don't fix it) and De'Niro is fabulous as always. Even the young Loriane Bracco (from Soprano's fame) deserved her nomination for best supporting actress in 1990.<br />Watch this movie if you enjoyed 'The Godfather' films, 'Casino' or love 'The Sopranos'<BR>4.5 Stars

B00005QZ7U|1.0|It is rare that I walk out of a film. It is rare that I feel so strongly about a film that it wrecks my day, and I want my two hours back. This film, admittedly, is quite stunning visually, and were it not for the infuriating music, I probably would have been neutral about it. Moulin Rouge's music is the ultimate train wreck of musical styles. I see nothing adventurous about smashing \\"voulez vous couchez avec moi\\" together with \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" All I see is two good songs torn out of their respective contexts and sloshed on a screen with enough glitter to cover the fact that this is a union made in Hell. Does anyone have that annoying friend who quotes song lyrics instead of speaking to you? This movie does it from one end to the other. Once is funny. Twice is trite. Three times is beating a dead horse. An entire film's worth is an aneurysm waiting to burst.<BR>Midway through the film there is a scene in which MacGregor's and Kidman's characters try to snow a potential financier by throwing all kinds of flash trash in his face in order to keep him from realizing that there was nothing behind it. It seemed a microcosm of the entire film: engineered to feature lots of shiny to keep the audience from realizing that this movie had no legs to stand on.<br />Do I really have to give it a star at all?

B000050IE6|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. So rare has been the occasion when I've heard such outstanding professionalism and maturity in songwriting, I can only think that Dream Theater match Opeth for songwriting ability. <BR>\\"Still Life\\", the 4th Opeth album, sees Mike Akerfeldt seemingly resting after the bludgeon that was \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\", and is definately Opeth's most \\"laid back\\" album, as well as their finest to date. However, don't think that the whole album is a peaceful affair, elements of fury become abundantly clear all over the place, this is what gives \\"Still Life\\" such diversity.<BR>Opener \\"The Moor\\" is one of my favourite Opeth songs, with a lengthy acoustic intro and a very haunting edge to it, one of the most beautiful acoustic interludes also occupies much of the song's middle part. \\"Godheads Lament\\" follows, a rather more aggressive song, and still brilliant.<BR>The Album features 2 fully acoustic songs: \\"Benighted\\" and \\"Face of Melinda\\", both which almost bring a tear to my eye, so filled with beauty and emotion, I love them, it would be too difficult to choose a favourite one from these two.<BR>These two songs however are interrupted by the brilliant \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\", also one of my favourite Opeth songs. The albums most aggressive song is \\"Serenity Painted Death\\", and demonstrates excellent use of guitar effects, adding more to Opeth's already very diverse sound. Then comes the most stunning closer I've heard \\"White Cluster\\", what a song, ten minutes of sheer class (which is what I could say for most Opeth songs!), so very suited to close such an epic masterpiece. <BR>I've been familiar with Opeth since the end of 1997, since such time they've become my favourite band, my fondness for their music just grows and grows, and this \\"Still Life\\" is my favourite album by them. Another one of favourite elements here, being a bassist, is the debut for Martin Mendez, the new (at the time) bassist, who proves himself just as great a player as former Opeth bassist Johan.
0525946284|4.0|Of 15 Ken Follett titles, I have read 15.  Why?  Because his stories are researched and spell-binding.  I can trust the historical background he uses for the unfolding thriller.  He sees history through his british spectacles, however, and the Nazis in \\"Jackdaws\\" are sadistic torturers up against one British heroine, who outwits them one by one.  Even I, as being German, am satisfied when she thrusts her knife in the evil doers eye; at this point nationality doesn't matter anymore. The evil has to be stopped...and more power to the British ladies! Gerborguta@hotmail.com
B00005QIPH|4.0|It's great fun to see the contortions that hipsters (especially New York hipsters) will go into to tear down the wall of hype that has grown up around the Strokes since late 2001.  Of course, a lot of their points are valid: Yes, these guys are essentially a bunch of private-school rocker wannabes with good music-industry connections; Yes, their sound sometimes uncannily resembles a focus-grouped, popified pastiche of V.U., Television, and the Stooges.  But what this hostility conveniently leaves out is how great and how instantly memorable most of the material on this album is. Beyond the obvious late-'60s and '70s influences, there's a great pop sensibility and shades of '80s new wave and indie bands woven into the mix in a way that's original even despite--or perhaps because of--its total derivativeness. (Sometimes I distinctly hear the Wedding Present; other times I could swear I'm picking up shards of Katrina and the Waves.)<br />This said, I do think the album's production doesn't really do justice to the sound of the Strokes live on a good night. While one can certainly understand the desire to capture a 'raw' sound on this disc, it took me a while to get over the muddy and compressed sound on a lot of these tracks after having been completed floored by one of their live shows in Hollywood last fall. (This show is burned into my memory in a way that ranks with very few others--it's up there with mid-period Replacements or Pere Ubu from my college days.) Once I got accustomed to the somewhat flat production, however, I found it hard to stop playing it continuously.  In sum, I'd guess that people who claim to hate this band (or this CD) with a passion probably have some issues to work out with their own musical envy. Their negative reviews say more about themselves then about what the Strokes have managed to put together on a generally amazing first album -- hype, connections, and serendipity aside.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I think &quot;Play&quot; is a terrific album, really...but I'm not really writing my review for that reason. The guy a few reviews below said this is the kind of album you get when you sign to a big label.  Unfortunately, this is Moby's first album after getting DROPPED from a major label, in this case Elektra.  They didn't think he could sell album anymore.  V2 picked him up, and a goldmine in the process.  <br />Just wanted to clear up a misconception about a great album.
0312954468|3.0|Wilbur Smith's very well written novel is about 600 pages long in paperback form. His description in the latter chapters of the war with the Hyksos (Shepherd kings) is excellent.  In the first few chapters, Taita the devoted, beautiful, man-slave of Queen Lostris, describes in detail how he was castrated (& more), plus Smith's continual references to homosexuality throughout the book If you are knowledgeable in egyptology, some parts are silly and unbelievable. A \\"Taita\\" stand? I'm still laughing at this one.  and \\"Taita\\" spoon?  Worthwhile reading.
B00005T33W|5.0|Outsiders Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) have clung to each other for years, counting the days until their high school graduation when they can finally get an apartment together and begin their \\"real\\" lives - or so they think. But life for these two alienated young women is far from easy, even after high school. Finding a place for themselves is going to be a longer, stranger trip than they can imagine.<br />  Birch and Johannson have a weird but fascinating symmetry, with their masks of cynicism and hardness and sharp humor to keep the rest of the world at bay. Enid ( Thora Birch) is the real center of this picture, especially as her veneer cracks and her insecurities begin to show. She turns out to be far more alienated and lonely than she seems at first and I was awed by Birch's performance here.<br />  When they decide to play a prank on an equally alienated adult, played by Steve Buscemi, Enid and Rebecca begin to spin off from each other. Enid is fascinated by the guy but Rebecca is not. Enid forms a strange relationship with him, one that affects her profoundly and threatens her friendship with Rebecca.<br /> Not just another teen flick (in fact, I'd guess the average teen might find it depressing) but more of a coming of age story made for the outsiders in the world. Loved it!

0440219078|5.0|Like thousands of other English classes around the country, mine has been reading The Giver. The Giver, in my opinion, is one of the most thought-provoking books of recent memory. The plot, which I won't give away as many other reviewers have, is very well crafted by Lowry. Though the book is intended for a younger audience, many adults will enjoy it as well. This book is a \\"must get\\" for any readers who truly understand and enjoy their books.

B00004Z459|5.0|I have been an alternative music fan for only about 6 years, but I can tell you this band is gonna go incredibly far with what I see they have to offer. Much like their counterpart,Limp, they do a perfect blend of rap/rock. And the song &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; is very experimental and new. I have alot of music that I will listen to maybe every once and a while, but I listen to this one everyday all day! If you like alternative music or just curious about Linkin Park from all the hype, buy this cd! I promise you'll fall in love with it instanly. &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; is the song I connected to the fastest. It's a very meaningful song and it will draw you to listen. I have nothing further to say but, &quot;I love it&quot;!

B00005UEAR|3.0|OK. I personally think dream theater is way over the top with their musicianship, mostly relying on self indulgent playing to satisfy their own needs instead of the listners.Some might say that's the point of music, but I think music itself can't be defined. Take for an example of a band called Pain of salvation.I feel passion in their music,(although they do sometimes go on the dream theater path, they create music not by self indulging, but by creatively presenting their music as more of a means of an artistic expression.<BR>So I guess your wondering why I gave the new album three stars? Here is why: Dream theater's best album in my opinion was images and words, because it had passion, and great song writing. This album has a numerous share of those \\"chills\\" of passion througout the two cd set. One of those songs is The Great Debate(which is kind of a lame title for the music it represents), but it starts off hypnotizing you until it builds up to the most shameful rip off of dream theater's career, ripping off another prog band called Tool. Funny that most prog metal bands rip off dream theater.Well enough of that, lets talk about Jordan's keyboard playing. His playing is fantastic, sometimes a little to happy for my taste, but he isn't Kevin Moore. Portnoy to me is a joke. His drumming is mediocre at best compared to the likes of Sean Reinert, or even Virgil Donati. Petrucci has gotten better in my view because he has expanded the method of playing really fast by using it as a way of art. Myung is one of the best bassists, even incorporating the chapman stick, which is always a plus in my book.I call him the silent octopuss because first of all you never hear him talk, and second his fingers are extremely long, reminding me of an octopuss.James.....well what can say about james, he sucks, that's it, plain and simple.<BR>The album it self is boring most of the time except for those \\"chills\\". production wise could have been better, but I think it best represents the music Dream Theater plays. Some of the technical stuff that makes the listner think is well executed, except for the occasional use of the masterbating guitar solos, other than that the album is okay, but not there best...............but that's my opinion!
B00005OAIE|4.0|...If you like music by artists not interested in making TV commercials, this CD is for you. Its new and off the beaten track. Almost reminds me of the Trash Can Sinatras, and certainly DMB before Dave went mainstream. There aren't many original bands out there, playing good, real, personal music. We're filled with too much hip hop, boy bands, pop-tarts, and need more bands like Freddy Jones Band and Toad the Wet Sprocket. Welcome Mayer to the world of real music. Stay that way.
B00005JKL8|1.0|This has to be one of the most worthless movies I have ever seen: everything not to do in a wartime situation. The only thing that could have made this movie worse was if the hotshot, buck-the-system fighter jock would have fallen, twisting his ankle because he was wearing high heels on his mission, while trying to get away from the bad guy... Absolutly worthless.
6305531374|2.0|Myer's should have hit the makeup artist first. Everyone looks embalmed.<br />My mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner was banned from watching this with me due to his tendency to do a one legged chicken dance at the sight of blood. I have no furniture or crockery left, just a pile of DVD's of which there is soon to be one less. Too many faults to mention - embarrassingly arch soundtrack comprising nods to the original, Psycho, Re-animator and Wagner. Over-lit. Fast when it should be slow - so I won't.<br />LL Cool J leads a charmed life. Had his torso nearly chewed in two with massive blood loss in 'Deep Blue Sea', but remained alive and perky. Here he has nearly half his head blown off, loses pints of blood and next he's up and about tap dancing. His extraordinary Lazarus like tendencies in films must be an 'audience demographics' thing. Ours is not to reason why, ours is just be white and die.<br />Now the mask. It was burned and now it's back. As I recall, it was stolen from a store, so how did he manage to find another after twenty years? Do you know what, I think he must have used *A CERTAIN WELL KNOWN INTERNET AUCTION HOUSE*. Does Micheal Myers have a credit card? Yes, Mr Myers, of course you can have a credit card, just put Mrs Smeddly down, she suffers from vertigo. It can't possibly be the same sort of mask because you can't hear his heavy breathing. Kills the film stone dead and makes him lack presence. He wuz robbed. So wuz we. Curtis is game and there's an ending worthy of the original but it's too little, too late.
B00005LB9O|5.0|travis's 3rd album comes out better and greater than the 2 before and equally as interesting and sing-along-able. &quot;flowers in the window&quot; is a truly lovely song that'll make any1 feel all happy and in the mood for love. the only problem is u cant stop listening to it! althought the words are often very simple they are real sweet and makes you feel like you can understand what fran's singing about. Fran is a true genios and i recommend any of their albums to EVERY one! although i know some people dont agree with me, i think this album is a truly great album what lots of people would enjoy so go and get it now! :D
0790742780|4.0|This is a film that wants to eat it's cake and have it. It wants us to get off on the vigilante violence and then puts in a studio dislaimer at the end explaining that we don't endorse this sort of behaviour. Veteran actor Duvall does the honours on their behalf. It is short on solutions but long on laughs. My favourite bit is with the water pistol. My mate Nigel 'Spunky' Turner says he loves it when it all spurts out. Hope he sees the film too, sometime.
B000001EC1|5.0|Okay this in Bon Jovi's greatest hits, it's just not called that.  Definately some thing to buy, with classics like Living on a prayer, Bed of Roses, Always, Runaway, Blaze of Glory, You give love a bad name...need I keep going?  Okay yes I would agree that the cd was a desperate attempt to jumpstart their flailing career and it almost worked.  But for Bon Jovi fans it was a gift from heaven.  Especially nowadays with Bon Jovi making new songs about it's my life and such this cd can become evermore popular.  If you are interested in what the 80's hard rock sounded like, buy this cd.
B00005UEAR|1.0|Here are the endless inigmas:would DT fans derive the same enjoyment from watching a gym coach doing hundreds of push-ups as they do from listening to DT's metronomic technobabble precision,in principle the two are fundamentally the same?<BR>Does technicality & musicality marry effortlessly?<BR>Has any member of DT ever dusted off their Oxford dictionary<BR>and looked up the term MUSIC?<BR>Would Petrucci's guitar still be in tune sans the luxury of a guitar tech or an electronic tuner?<BR>If all the technical prowess was removed from the music on this album what would you really have left?<BR>If a vocalist don't cut it live and is unlucky in the forgivable confines of the studio(where endless takes are possible),does he/she cut it at all?<br />Before I attempt to establish the point of all of this I'd like to state that I think this album is actually a musical improvement on SFAM and FII.Petrucci's soloing sounds interesting,melodic(yes!melodic!)and spontaneous.A good attempt at some light & shade is noticably evident(probably Rudess's input) and for the DT fans,its all going to be much gosh and wow,and believe me there's tons of it on SDOIT.<br />So,what am I bitching about?Simply this:If Portnoy & Petrucci(who have elected themselves producers)are striving for perfection what perfection are they striving for,technical,musical,lyrical,conceptual,production?<br />Technical perfection(or close) has pretty much been reached here,but the lyrical content is so amateurish it's vitually laughable and as for the song quality if all the technobabble were stripped out you'd be left with material that David Gilmour would have consigned to FILE13 long before it reached demo stage.There are no innovative chord changes or key shifts to offset the technical stuff(their strongest point without doubt)and when they do settle down to slower stuff it sounds trite,forced almost an afterthought.The woeful Overture is painfully evident of this,it makes the hideously kitchy Blue Danube sound like Stravinsky's Rite Of Spring.I would have expected far more from a talent like Rudess,assuming he composed this muck.<br />And now for the real mystery,WHY WHY WHY if these guys are such wonderful musicians do they seem totally oblivious to the glaringly obvious fact that James Labrie's intonation is dodgy to say the least, on OIAL his high notes are often cringe material and the transition between intervals is unconvincing,OK live this is forgivable but these shortfallings(admittedly to a lesser degree) manage to surface on just about every studio DT recording.How many producers have DT been through,two,three different producers same vocal int. problems,whats wrong with this picture?<BR>Either messrs. Portnoy&Petrucci have spent too much time practicing 32nd notes with a metronome they ended up with competent hands and incompetent ears(see the guitar tuning enigma) or they haven't worked with a super hot singer(who would improve the quality of the material overall by writing more convincing melodies and creating a more give and take creative environment for the guys to work with)or they're fully aware of the problem and some record exec has told them to shut up,\\"he's good for the frontline image\\",perhaps we'll never be too sure?<br />I'm really sorry but as a paying member of the record buying public I feel shortchanged by much of DT's output I.E<BR>Technicality-awesome<BR>Songwriting/Musicality-Abysmal(not always,but too frequently)<BR>Lyrical skills-Please!<br />Concepts-Stale and contrary to what they're(DT) supposed to be all about-formularised the very opposite of the word Progressive<br />An album by a band with this type of status should contain equal quality(or roughly) of all the above points not just one(one out of four is not a good enough average).Why is the end product suffering? Is it because messrs Portnoy&Petrucci's egos won't allow a hired hand to enter?If lyrics are the weak point get a cool lyricist whose hip to your cause,if the vox dontcut it,get a skilled producer and start auditioning,collaborate on songwriting.If it strengthens all the weak areas,where's the harm in that???<br />Once again I'm sorry but I believe DT could be a force to be reckoned with,with all the right elements in place.<br />Progressive by its very nature means to move forward,explore.<BR>Bands like ELP went wherever the music & fancy took them,they did not form a style.Can formulas and be progressive!!<br />I will now don my bulletproof flack jacket.<br />Hand me that copy of DSOM
0783229011|1.0|I'm sorry, but my eyes were filled with tears through the entire movie!!! Sure, it's nice seeing the animals talk, but it's SOO 'darn' sad! It's just another depressing animal movie. <BR>If you love animals and want a good bawl, this movie's for you.
B000002IHU|3.0|Lay It Down is the best song on this album.  Another song that comes close is &quot;Dangerous But Worth The Risk&quot;.  &quot;You're In Love&quot; is great, too.  Warren Demartini is one of the best guitar players of the 80s or any decade.
B00005V1Z0|3.0|I put off seeing this movie for a long time.  During the first 5 minutes I thought my fears were right about it just being a movie with a great looking star and nothing else (and I'm not interested in great looking female stars).  The first scene was pretty silly, as were many to follow... but as the movie progressed, her character was made more whole.  The movie makers did a pretty good job of giving her some depth of character that went beyond treasure hunting and killing bad guys.  Jolie did a superb job playing this character.  The story line had some holes in it, but who really cares.  I recommend it, either you'll love it or you'll hate it!
B000001EQT|5.0|My friend Marc and I used to take trips to the old coastal bunkers all around the San Francisco Bay Area to map them out.  The first thing we would do when hopping into the car was stick The Slider in the 8 track.  Now admittedly, the lyrics were nonsensical and silly, but the sound was so catchy, that in no time we'd be singing along with them.  The sound was just so unique and riveting, that we'd listen over and over.  Point is, this album will give bring back memories if you grew up in that era, and will give you an idea of what it was really like growing up in the 70's.
0780626478|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies of all time starring Christopher Walken, Sissy Spacek, Brendan Fraser, and Alicia Silverstone. Walken and Spacek are hilarious as the parents of Adam Weber (Fraser), a couple who through an unlikely set of events end up stuck in a fallout shelter for 35 years, where Adam is born.<br />From beginning to end, this is one of those very rare movies that pays thoughtful attention to the smallest details; indeed, I've seen the flick at least a dozen times and I continue to pick up small nuances I missed before. Eve (Silverstone) enters later into the movie as Adam's love interest, and in my opinion, delivers one of her finest performances ever. <br />This film leaves you with a very positive, upbeat feeling. The only criticism I could possible state about it: Some of the language seems out of place and unnecessary for this type of movie. I purchased it for my younger children, because I believe it is an object lesson in how people should treat each other, and some rather crude swearing by Silverstone detracted from what I otherwise consider perfection in direction, casting and acting.<br />Highly recommended for all ages (with the noted language warning).
0345413377|5.0|My [age} year old daughter and I still read at night, and we began the \\"Golden Compass\\" last spring.  We devoured that and the \\"Subtle Knife\\" quickly and were delighted when the paperback version of the \\"Amber Spyglass\\" arrived this fall.  I am still reading this book to my daughter, although I finished it on my own last night.  To be sure, this book has problems -- the universes Pullman creates at not completely consistent and he seems ready to change his \\"rules\\" -- the nature of \\"Dust,\\" the physicality of angels, etc. -- when it fits the greater narrative purpose.  As a practicing Catholic, I am also troubled by the strong anticlerical themes of the \\"Dark Materials\\" series.  And the hints of sexuality in this last book are going to be a little tricky to negotiate.  But having said those things, I would urge you to buy this book and read it with -- or to -- a young adult.  It is full of important ideas that we will discuss for months, perhaps years, to come.  As a vehicle to help children think for themselves, this is an excellent choice. We have read \\"Lord of the Rings\\" together, and I am anxious to hear my daughter's thoughtful comparison of these two similar, yet distinctly different, trilogies.  By all means, buy it -- for yourself and your child.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is the first one of these I've ever written for Amazon, although I read them all the time before I make a purchase.  I just felt compelled to add my two cents, because the Amazon review of this album just completely missed the mark.  I had John Mayer's independent album before this release, and while that was good, this one took those songs one step further.  Could they wind up as background music to a TV show?  Yeah, they could.  But the song writing is excellent, the music heartfelt, and the whole thing really catchy.  I've passed on this album to a few friends who aren't even fans of this genre of music, and they've fallen in love too.  Trust me - you don't want to miss out on this one.
0446677450|5.0|Robert's book has remotivated me to focus on the principle, my money works for me, not, me working for money.  Another valuable insight he shares is the alarming number of students, workers and professionals who are financially illiterate, and stuck in the 'rat-race.'  As a self-employed real estate consultant I have a mission to educate my clients on reducing liabilities and building assets.  As a youth mentor,  I have a passion to teach kids to work smarter, not harder.  I have used this book as a guide.<BR>I bought the book and the audio CD, which I finished in less than a week.<BR>I highly recommend this book for client, wedding, and graduation gifts.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This hauntingly beautiful film asks something of its audience.  Don't expect high action, and don't look for constant explainations of what you see.  Active contemplation is what I expect Spielberg wanted from his audience with this outing.  Several reviewers on this page remark that the third act of this film is overwrought, even hokey.  For those of us who pay attention and understand that the \\"aliens\\" (which assimilate David's memories) at the end of this film are not aliens at all, but self-evolving mecha which have discovered a missing link to their original creators (i.e.: humans), then we are rewarded with one of the brightest speculative fiction films in many years.  To paraphrase Gigolo Joe: \\"Humans hate us because when they're gone, we will be all that's left.\\"  This search for the creator is ultimately a very human endeavor.  I found that my fondness of this quiet bit of specualtion grew exponentially with multiple viewings (at first, I also thought those mecha were aliens--which cheapened the film a bit--once I came to the realization, it was as if I had seen an entirely different film).  A highly Kubrickian film, despite what many of his so-called \\"die-hard\\" fans might think.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This movie was boring. The plot was ridiculous. It would have been much more interesting if they'd decided to go with a little bit of intrigue rather than just plowing through with the bad guy they'd been hinting at the whole movie. In the end the action is tedious. Go rent Bullit.
B00005B238|5.0|...This movie has earned every one of its stars.  It's got lots of big guns, it's got sweat, it's got muscles, it's got classic dialogue (\\"I ain't got time to bleed\\", if it bleeds, we can kill it\\"), it's got war, it's got jungle, it's got science-fiction, and it's got Arnold, Jesse \\"the Body\\", Carl Weathers and a shell-shocked Bill Duke.  What else could it need?...The cast, the acting and the scenery in this flick do more than enough to carry a cliche plot.  I'd watch this again, over and over and over, and I highly recommend it.  This is definitely one of my all-time favorites.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|While many will rave about the process of this movie, the sad fact is that the end/beginning is sorely lacking. It is hopelessly depressing. Anyone who's read the Count of Monte Christo knows how this one ends. But you cannot deny the process is brilliant.
1573226521|5.0|I began this book prepared to dislike it.  With the movie poster splashed across the front cover, I figured this would be derivative \\"Hollywood-esque\\" pulp drawing largely on Lord of the Flies for inspiration.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a genuine novel between the covers.  The main character is well delineated, and Garland takes the courageous step of making his protagonist a less than sympathetic character.  At times you end up empathizing more with various secondary characters than you do with Richard.  Garland also manages to integrate disparate elements of Western culture--movies, video games, \\"wanderlust\\", cartoons, disillusionment--in a way that usually tells us more about the characters.  I don't know if Garland is drawing upon some of his own experiences, but many of the perspectives seem genuine, and the \\"coming of age\\" theme comes through without being heavyhanded.<br />The action proceeds in a slow, revolving cycle that somehow seems appropriate for the languid environment of The Beach.  While this could be a criticism, I did not mind the slow pace--it gives you time to get to know the characters better, even though you know this utopia cannot endure.  Garland also had the good sense not to include a sappy romance storyline (which Hollywood felt obligated to add).<br />However, there is one thing to make clear:  this novel is no \\"Gen X\\" introspection, as some of the editorial reviews indicated.  It is a dangerous step to extrapolate the values that appear in \\"The Beach\\" beyond the scope of the book's pages.<br />Unfortunately the movie loses some of the character depth in translation to the film--it is a worthy attempt that falls short.  They shaped the film to fit Leonardo DiCaprio, rather than vice versa, and they added extraneous storylines,  eliminated an important character, and altered the denouement.  The ending short-changes some of the themes that hold the storyline together.<br />The novel is worth the read, but skip the movie.  Garlandtakes you for an interesting ride that keeps you reading to the end.
0380973650|5.0|What a great book.  I had heard and read so much ABOUT Neil Gaiman, but never read anything by him.  So I decided to give American Gods a chance.  I was blown away, literally.  Shadow is such a likable character, with a good heart, strong, but full of flaws.  This goes along with all the supporting roles.  Every one is wholly unique and perfect in their designated areas, from Wednesday to Easter, to Mr. World and Mad Sweeney.  Anybody looking for a really good book to read over a couple of days or a weekend, I highly recommend this.  Beware, you may not be able to put it down, so if you are supposed to be keeping an eye on small children, don't read this.  It will keep your undivided attention from start to finish.  Now, onto the next Neil Gaiman book I can lay my hands on....
B00003TL49|5.0|Fiona Apple's great talent as singer and composer is seriously undermined by her mega-company's sellability standards: &quot;Paper Bag&quot; is the only song that does not sound grossly overproduced and mechanically performed.<BR>Her lyrics, though as interesting as on TIDAL and as full of biblical guilt and post-teenage bourgeois insecure and angry lust,  this time spill over with forced intellectualism.<BR>I still love her, though.
031286504X|5.0|Matheson had written many great novels, but this has got to be one of his finest. True, I do wish that it was longer, he tells a complete, complex story with twist and turns like few out there. His attempt to blame vampirism on a virus was near brilliant, the story entertaining overall. By turning the tables, he shows what it is like from the other side of the mirror. I would recomend this book to anyone who has ever read Ann Rice and wants something better.
B00003CXXP|1.0|The effects are very cool, and Jude Law is fun to watch, but this film overall is just plan lame.  It's as though Spielberg tried to direct as if he were Stanley Kubrik, which he definitely isn't.  The two directors' styles clashed severely and ultimately hurt the vision of the film.<br />I've never walked out of a movie in the theater but by the time the 2nd hour was up (with much more to go) I was ready to split.
6305075492|5.0|Image Entertainment over the last few years has built a reputation for high-quality DVD releases of classic films from the silent era, and Image's special edition treatment of THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI is no exception.  It goes without saying that Robert Weine's 1919 masterpiece was a groundbreaking moment in the history of Expressionist cinema, so I will confine my remarks to assessing the DVD release.  <br />In short, I find Image's video and audio transfer here to be superb, and a vast improvement over other available video releases.  Many reviewers have expressed concern over the black bar that frequently runs through the top of the frame.  As I understand it, the black bar is found on the negative itself, which is otherwise in relatively good condition given the film's age.  This is NOT Image's fault.  They had the choice between either cropping the top of the image, which is how the film has often been presented, or preserving the full frame, inspite of the black bar.  Image chose the later option and, in my view, it was the right one, though some viewers might disagree. Otherwise, the tinted black and white image is quite good, and is complemented by a highly effective musical score (the sound is crisp and full).  Finally, the Image DVD features a very informative audio commentary with film scholar Mike Budd.  This DVD deserves viewing by anyone serious about film, and not fortunate enough to have seen a theatrical print.  Moreover, if you are interested in Expressionist cinema, I would highly recommend that you add this DVD to your library.
B00003CXXP|5.0|All I have to say is this: Those who thought A.I. was not a good movie (God, some even go so far as to say it's \\"terrible\\"), probably have parents/grandparents who said the same thing about 2001: A Space Odyssey when it was released. Obviously, everyone has a right to an opinion, but the level of ignorance and misinterpretation surrounding this movie only solidifies its virtues. Luckily there are some of us who can recognize them.
0064407667|4.0|...READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK JACKET! Does it sound funny and amusing? Then you will probably like it. If you think \\"ewww\\" then you will probably dislike it. It's as simple as that. The book is dark humor and dark humor only appeals to certain tastes. I would have loved this book as a child since I was raised on such movies as Arsenic and Old Lace. Other children may be frightened, use you own judgement. However, it is my belief that these books are more fun for adults than children.<br />I fail to see why these novels are compared to the Harry Potter series (of which I am not a fan) since they are not really the same genre. I think this book will be more enjoyable readers who have had wide experience in the field of \\"orphan\\" stories (read the Boxcar Children back to back with this book and note some amusing comparisons) This irreverent tale turns many of the cliches of the genre on their heads.<br />Now, adult content. Forced marriage to a 14 year old. I honestly do not believe that most children will think of the risque aspect of the plot device. After all, it is not really dwelled on and besides it has been used in Disney films, fairy tales and such for years. And the plot is all centered around getting the fortune from the children not Count Orloff finding a bride. Again, parents should use their own disgression. (The same argument goes for the child in danger plot device)<br />This book has marvelous dry humor and it is a kick to read but it simply is not for all tastes.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie rocked!  It takes the classics of years gone by and todays music and mingles them all into one.  Nicole Kidman has a beautiful voice and when you combine it with Ewan McGregor it's breadth taking.  The movie moves very fast and is well worth it.
6304698542|3.0|Tailor and Oscar made for Liza Minnelli [better in \\"Sterile Cuckoo\\"]this work although dated aptly reflects some of that period.<br />BUT what happened to the sub-plot?  The Landlady and her romance?????  This one's kinda 'gorgeous people' circa Nazi Berlin, and was the rage when it opened, but it has dated even more than the previous excursion into this territory - the earlier \\"I Am A Camera\\" with Julie Harris.  Joel Grey seems one beat away from a musical Freddy Kruger in this one although a deserved Oscar, at that time, went to him.  An unusual part - possible homage to Visconti here, and unique, no dialogue for the MC - just song after successful song, Brechtian!<br />Milquetoast Michael York [very 1970] stars as the sexually confused Brian [Isherwood - a little more glam that Laurence Harvey is that's possible, but Harvey did play \\"Christopher\\" in the earlier version].  AND it's sexually very open for 1970 too [bisexuality, confusion, abortion, confusion, etc. and the \\"f\\" word too!]<br />Favourites?  The Chorus Girls of course, and the band, now THAT's close to the original earlier somewhat lumpy, but still glam 'Blue Angel' gals, but didn't DIETRICH do this so much better???<br />Would be nice to see a re-imagining of this work - as written by Mr. Isherwood, page by page.
B00005KARK|5.0|This was my favorite disney movie as a child and it still is now that I am an adult. It gets better and cuter every time I see it. I hope my kids will enjoy it as much as I have.
B000056K04|4.0|I think this is most definatly one of The Dave Matthews Band's Best CD's espicially #'s 2,3,4,6,9 but there all great. If you should get any CD it is this one. <BR>      You'll love it!
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie was by far the best movie I've ever seen. I saw it in the theater and it was the first dvd i bought. The movie is great all the way around. The action is fast paced, the story is awesome, and the special effects are superb. If you don't like this movie at least a little bit, you should not be allowed to watch movies.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|With an evil protagonist second only to Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty (and perhaps Ursula in The Little Mermaid), this is a great show--though really small kids might be scared.  Also, its values reflect its times, so you're not going to see much in the way of feminist activism here...
B00003CXN4|2.0|\\"Traffic\\" has been heralded as a \\"daring\\" look at the War on Drugs.  But it's only daring from the perspective of someone who thought the War on Drugs has been a resounding success.  Frankly, to those who have been willing to make themselves familiar with the failures of the multi-trillion dollar campaign, the film covers nothing new and really could have been far more provocative.  Not that it's a bad thing that the limited scope of the film shook up people who think inside a narrow box a bit.  As a film on it's own, it deserves some praise as an entertaining, well-acted (especially from Del Toro) crime film.  But make no mistake, this film has much broader aspirations, and that is where it fails.  It is fair to compare it to the British mini-series that it's based on, \\"Traffik\\", which was produced 11 years earlier yet is far more insightful and relevant.  That film has a broader scope-- it deals with the a third world opium farmer rather than a third world cop, for example--, the dialogue is sharper -- compare the Hollywood gushiness of Douglas's final speech to the powerful efficiency of the original's counterpart speech-- and it makes far more daring observations-- the original notes how America allies itself with Pakistani heroin traders so they can fight the Soviet Union, where as the remake has dialogue and plot points which completely exonerates the American government of such activity, which is, sadly, totally false.  If you want to see a really want a daring film about the War on Drugs, skip \\"Traffic\\" and see \\"Traffik\\".  Then, if you want to really have the tragedy and hypocrisy of War on Drugs laid out for you, read \\"Dark Alliance\\" by Gary Webb.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This film takes risks that mostly pay off.  Its stunning delights of sight and sound sometimes border on the fantastic but do not reach tiresome absurdity.  Enough plot to bring the cacophony together in a touching (if cliche) romance.  I recommend you check out this film and, if you enjoy the change from Hollywood's usual fair, rent the director's Romeo+Juliet.
B000000WFF|5.0|After their #1 hit album \\"Spice\\" (which was also the #1 album of 1997), the Spice Girls released \\"Spiceworld.\\" Although it wasn't as successful as their first, I think it's better. The album starts off with the fantastic dance tune \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" with its infamous chorus, it's instantly recognizable. \\"Stop\\" is infectious and musucally, it's very well put together. \\"Too Much\\" is slow and sexy with great vocals by the girls. I also love \\"Viva Forever\\" which is a gorgeous ballad and also the closing \\"The Lady Is A Vamp\\" which has a 40's big-band style to it and is catchy as hell. So, even though they're long gone now, The Spice Girls left behind some classic pop. To all pop fans out there, be open-minded and give a listen. You might find that you like it!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I'd been a HUGE fan of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet in 1996 but did not think to see this movie until it grabbed the attention of the Academy and Golden Globes. I suppose being used to his style made it easier for me to fall in love with the film, viewers seem to either love it fiercely or hate it with a passion.<br />As others have mentioned, the story is simple yet touching. The score is amazingly blended into the film's musical numbers and it's nearly impossible not to find yourself singing along in your repeat viewings. Watch out for Ewan McGregor's sudden outbursts of song, they're beautiful and breathtaking. He plays his role exceptionally well, his face perfectly capturing that of the innocent man untouched by the cruel machinations of Love. I was *very* surprised with his singing ability.<br />Nicole Kidman is even better. I was shocked at how stunningly beautiful she is. I could have lived with fewer poodle yips from her, but other than that I thought she was amazing, I now have a new favorite for Best Actress when March 24 comes around! I will be sure to buy this, I have a feeling I won't get tired of it...
B00005YTFG|5.0|Moulin Rouge is an excellent movie if, and only if, you enjoy musicals and love stories. While the songs were all redone, the way they were sang was great, and I feel that this is one of the best muscials. Moulin Rouge is a movie that you must see twice to really love. After the first time I saw it I didn't really like it, but after the second, I thought it was amazing. Do yourself a favor, watch it twice before you decide weather or not to like it.
0345440803|5.0|This book is worth every penny. They did an exceptional job of organization, presentation and, yes, marketing. It has the test for your child's 'type' and your parenting style. The chapter on Ritual and Routine is fabulous with so many good, practical little bits to enhance your toddler's day. It also has THE BEST solid food introduction/weaning plan I've EVER seen. There is also so much good stuff in the chapters on life skills and emotional development to read &amp; re-read &amp; re-read again to stay mindful of. In summation, this book gives you a plethora of tools to help us be the best parent we can be. There is great stuff applicable from the time you start contemplating feeding your baby solids until their pre-school years. I've read A LOT of books on parenting and babies and, yes, if you don't buy any other book on toddlerhood, buy this one. It IS the ESSENTIAL guide for parents of babies and toddlers. I recommend it to everyone.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie really rocked.The whole picture was good and the cast is great.The love story and the attack on Pearl Harbor are awesome.Don't listen to the bad reviews on this movie,because its a wonderful movie to watch.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|Yes, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a technically daring movie.  But it is also one of the most irritating movies of all time.  The director Baz Luhrmann rarely keeps his camera focused for more than a split second on any actor in this movie.  Everytime you want to get a good look at the actor's face and expressions, Luhrmann purposely swings the camera away from the actor.   It makes for a very cold and distant presentation of the story.<br />And the songs are often screamed (rather than sung) in an annoying high pitch.  This becomes grating, even repulsive to hear.<br />I think Baz Luhrmann has appeared on every entertainment news show on television praising the &quot;artistry&quot; of his own movie.  That kind of vanity just adds to the general distastefulness of this movie.  <br />Getting a root canal is a less painful experience than seeing and listening to this in-your-face, over-the-top, and reveling-in-its-own-excess shipwreck of a movie. And when I say &quot;shipwreck&quot;, I'm talking the Titanic.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This was a great movie because the actors all have awesome chemistry,and are just wonderful actors.The story of Pearl Harbor is great and the romance added makes it appealing to a wilder audience.It is very touching and I recommend it to everyone.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I know it is Tom Wait you either love him or you hate him. As you can tell by my rating I am in the former camp. This is simply one of my favourite Cd's. A musical portrait of the underside of a city (any city). <br />Time, Blind Love, Hang down your head, Walking Spanish they are all classic songs. And Down town train as it was meant to be heard.
1573227978|5.0|Before seeing the film, I decided to read the highly acclaimed novel by Alex Garland.  A book of adventure, societal interaction, and psychosis, The Beach will take you on a journey through the wilds of Thailand. The dream of Utopia is a common literary thread, combine that dream with a fantastic locale and you have The Beach.  This combination, is certain to provide with an entertaining read.  It's like the Lord of the Flies, combined with a really interesting travelogue.  The scenery is extremely well described... You can feel the warm sun on your brow, you can taste the fresh fish, you can smell the spice of life.  This adventurous tale was not done justice in the film.  In fact, the film butchers some of the most important themes.  The book is much deeper, and more thorough.  Some of the main themes, in fact were lost on the film.  For a great adventure, certain to warm a winter-weary soul, the Beach is a great read.  Warning: It can be a bit graphic.

0920236162|5.0|I'm a mature mom with a lively 4-year-old daughter. We both love Elizabeth's smarts and gumption. I'm trying to impress upon my daughter that anyone who does not value her strengths more than her looks is not worth hanging on to. As a writer, I recently interviewed a teenaged girl who was learning to stay out of abusive relationships. I told her the story of The Paperbag Princess and she got immediately that it applied to her too, even at 16.
B00005QZWI|5.0|My brother got this cd for his birthday on Dec. 1, eighteen days before the movies came out. I loved it from the moment I 'borrowed' it from him, and listened to it as I read the book series LOTR for the first time. (Note: Do NOT listen to the song 'The Breaking of the Fellowship' when you are finishing the last book, the Return of the King, especially late at night. I did this and actually cried. I cringe thinking about it.) Anyway. I knew I had to have my own copy of the cd, so I bought mine after seeing the movie(twice). One thing I have to say is that I am so surprised no one has ever really used Howard Shore's great talents for such a project before. He is an incredible composer, at times I am reminded of John Williams, but only in the first few songs on the cd. I love all the songs on the cd, but the ones I listen to most are 'Many Meetings', 'The Council of Elrond', 'The Ring Goes South', 'A Journey in the Dark', 'The Bridge of Khazad Dum', 'Lothlorien', 'The Great River', and 'May it Be'. (I know, that's alot. But I like them all!) If I had to name three favourites (oh, so hard!) they would be in this order: 'The Ring Goes South', 'The Great River', and 'May it Be'. So. On a final note, let me just say that this cd is worth buying whether a fan of LOTR (books, movie, or both) or just a fan of good soundtrack music. I really hope that more people will recognize Howard Shore's genius and use him more often (I know I will).
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you watch Moulin Rouge expecting to see a cross between Showgirls and the MTV video awards, you are not going to like this picture.  If you love pop culture, the American Movie Musical, and can suspend your disbelief for long enough to indulge yourself in a visual and auditory feast... you'll love Moulin Rouge... with its references and nods to silent film, classic stage productions of the 1930's and 40's, and homages to over 200 years of vaudeville and dance hall theatre. This is a modern spin on the story of 'the hooker with a heart of gold'  story that has been so bungled in films like 'Pretty Woman.'  The lush sets are nothing short of amazing.  The visual effects are astounding.  The music is wonderful.  Thank God there's someone besides Disney making movie musicals again.<br />The actors voices are great... very unexpected by such well known film stars.  Nicole is beautiful; Ewan is a cutie... Why didn't other folks like this film?  I don't know... keep them away from the DVD player while this movie is on.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams truly outdid himself with this. The score to Harry Potter not only perfectly contributes to the mood and tone of each scene in the movie, but taken on its own, it proves to be great overall music. Wonderful!
B000000OPU|4.0|This CD has some really thoughtful songs on it, despite the rather clunky soul rehash \\"Sledgehammer\\" that has been played to death on VH-1.  Actually, Gabriel's metaphors on that song do display a shred of intelligence and wit, but they pale in comparison with the depth of the rest of the album.  Highlights include \\"Don't Give Up,\\" which features a surprisingly restrained Kate Bush (she must have taken her Valium for this one) who sounds, as Rolling Stone put it, \\"like the breath of life itself.\\"  Too bad Kate felt the need to play the part of a crazed banshee on much of her solo work...she could have been great.  \\"That Voice Again\\" is another thoughtful track, and is both well-written and well-executed, and features some of Gabriel's best singing and vocal harmonization ever.  Of course, we're all familiar with \\"In Your Eyes\\"...there's something about this song that stirs the soul.  And finally, \\"Mercy Street\\" is an excellent mood piece that only begins to scratch the surface of the hopelessness and despair Anne Sexton must have felt.  Well done.
B000007492|4.0|I wasn't really aware of Supertramp until they were considered classic rock. A good portion of the songs on this compilation were released before I was even born, so it's not hard to imagine how I could have missed them in their earlier years. So, bless ..., my classic rock station. I had gotten used to hearing songs like Breakfast In America and The Logical Song on a regular basis. I remember thinking that Supertramp was a prog band, based on the few songs I was familiar with. A friend told me otherwise, but I've heard them referred to as `pop-prog,' so I couldn't have been too far off. <br />So, I became a relatively casual fan. Sure, I'd go see them live if they came around, but I wasn't sure I wanted to invest in their entire catalog. And that's why I was excited to find out that they would be remastering their Very Best Of, and releasing it in December, 2001. It was originally released in 1992, and covers 1974 to 1985, which are considered to be their best years. <br />I consider this to be a pretty definitive collection. I admit that I'm not a hardcore fan, and I don't know enough about the band to point out songs that should have been included. However, this covers just about everything I'm familiar with, and it would be a great introduction for those who aren't too familiar with the band. <br />Supertramp <BR>The Very Best Of <BR>Remastered <br />1. School - from Crime Of The Century,1974 <BR>2. Goodbye Stranger - from Breakfast In America, 1979 <BR>3. The Logical Song - from Breakfast In America, 1979 <BR>4. Bloody Well Right - from Crime Of The Century,1974 <BR>5. Breakfast In America - from Breakfast In America, 1979 <BR>6. Rudy - from Crime Of The Century,1974 <BR>7. Take The Long Way Home - from Breakfast In America, 1979 <BR>8. Crime Of The Century - from Crime Of The Century,1974 <BR>9. Dreamer - from Crime Of The Century,1974 <BR>10. Ain't Nobody But Me - from Crisis? What Crisis?, 1975 <BR>11. Hide In Your Shell - from Crime Of The Century,1974 <BR>12. From Now On - from Even In The Quietest Moments, 1977 <BR>13. Give A Little Bit - from Even In The Quietest Moments, 1977 <BR>14. It's Raining Again - from ...famous last words..., 1982 <BR>15. Cannonball - from Brother Where You Bound, 1985 <br />Supertramp is... <br />Rick Davies: boards, vocals <BR>John Helliwell: saxophones <BR>Dougie Thomson: Bass <BR>Bob Siebenberg: vocals <BR>Roger Hodgson: guitars, keyboards, vocals <br />Hodgson may be the most recognizable name in the band, as he has a few solo releases, has done some co writing with the popular prog group Yes, and has most recently been touring on guitar with Ringo & The All Starr Band. <br />The CD itself includes liner notes by Doug Haverty, a known name when it comes to art direction and design. The notes include reflections on each Supertramp album, discussing the direction of the band, musically and otherwise for each endeavor. <br />Sometimes it seems as though best of, or greatest hit collections turn out as a choppy list of randomly placed songs. In this case, Supertramp could have easily released this as an original album. Though spanning 11 years unchronologically, the tracks flow smoothly without smacking the listener in the face as the phase changes. <br />Presumably, the most recognizable tracks will be cuts like Give A Little Bit, and not only because of that now retired Christmas Gap commercial. It's mostly an acoustic guitar and vocal track, which isn't what I typically think of when think of Supertramp. But most people I know can at least hum this tune, if not sing along, even if they claim to have never heard of the band. <br />....<br />I'm pretty sure you were able to catch Mellencamp, Gray, or Morissette singing that one over the holidays. You may also be acquainted with The Logical Song, which I believe was my introduction to the band. It's more keyboard oriented, with beats that really hinted at prog for me. <br />.... <br />Something about the way these lyrics flow that reallydrew me into it. I suppose Supertramp is really just a rock band, but I think they definitely straddle a line. It's something in the mix of brass and keyboards, and the full, melodic vocals that ties the band in with prog groups. And Hodgson did write with Yes, so making that comparison is pretty safe, I think. I don't know if I would say \\"If you like Yes or other prog bands of the like, you'd like Supertramp,\\" but it's a definite consideration. These guys don't have that huge dramatic sound that dominates the progressive scene. I find them to be closer to a rock band, but the piano interludes, and full vocals tend to push the boundaries. <br />On that note, I should add that most of the prog bands I'm into are on the border. A song like Crime Of The Century could have easily been Jethro Tull, Genesis, or ELO. Allmusic lists similar artists to be Styx, Yes, Alan Parsons Project, and others in that musical area. If you're into any of the above bands, I think Supertramp might be a worthwhile investment, of only for this Very Best Of. <br />Another early favorite of mine is Breakfast In America. The song doesn't even last 3 minutes, but it has a kind of elephant marching beat with saxophones that make it quite memorable. The lyrics also became imprinted in my brain. I suppose they were just kind of random when I first heard them, and I never forgot. <br />....<br />Here's something fun for you to try out. If you have a copy of Breakfast in America, play the intro to the song. Then, get yourself a copy of Don't Speak by No Doubt, and play the intro to that one as well. It won't knock you off your chair, but my friend has an entire CD of songs that sounds like other songs, so making this connection was a thrill for me. <br />This compilation also turned me onto some songs that I had been previously unfamiliar with, such as It's Raining Again, which is, uh, kind of cute. Of course it has to end with some kids singing the universally known \\"It's raining, it's pouring\\" song. The first time I heard this track, it sounded so familiar, but I'm pretty sure I'd never heard it before. It just has such a familiar beat and riff that I could easily place it somewhere in the 1950's. Not that it actually sounds that way, or dated at all. It just has a reminiscent familiarity to it. <br />For established Supertramp fans, I'd clearly recommend The Very Best Of Remastered. I find it to be quite a complete collection, and the tracks have all been digitally remastered. The liner note commentaries are also a big plus. I would also strongly recommend this for those who have a lighter interest in the band, and want a general overview and highlights. And as for those who are into those `similar' artists, if you want a broad spectrum of a collection, get this. I'd also recommend the following albums for starters: <br />Crime of the Century - 1974 <BR>Even In The Quitest Moments - 1977 <br />And most of all: <br />Breakfast in America - 1979 <br />This one, in my opinion, has the most hits, and contains most of the songs that will ring a bell, including Take The Long Way Home. <br />However, this compilation contains those songs, plus other popular songs from other albums, and I'd really urge you to pick this up if you're unsure. It's a best of that's certainly worth you time!
6303965415|1.0|I was anticipating watching this movie ... and i was really disappointed by the fact that the casting was completely horrible.  Anne was cast badly, Captain Wentworth was cast badly...in fact the whole cast just seemed out of place. There was no good music in the background, not a significant, good amount of development about Anne and Wentworth's feelings.  Lady Russell was cast badly as well.  This isn't just a biased opnion, i'm sure many people would agree if they saw this movie just how badly it was cast and that the actors just ruined the beautiful story.

B000003N7Y|5.0|Mingus X5 is second only to \\"The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\\" on my list of favorite Mingus recordings.  Now I have to admit that most of the songs heard here are old favorites that were previously released on other labels but were given aliases for this recording date, but I think it is well worth the money.  \\"Hora Decubitus\\" is just an alias for \\"E's Flat Ah's Flat Too\\" which was released under Mingus by Atlantic three years earlier on Blues and Roots. \\"Theme for Lester Young\\" also released as \\"Good Bye Pork Pie Hat\\" (this time 4 years earlier)  With both songs and with the rest of the previously released material,  The better work is heard here on Mingus X5.  Better sound, better solo efforts, and better arrangements! Evidence of Mingus's constant reevaluation of himself, ability to inspire his sidemen, and his constant search, like all great artists, for perfection in their work.<br />I normally don't like to give away details, but \\"Freedom\\" the last track on Mingus X5 is introduced with a beautiful poem read, and assume written by Mingus over the soft hum of his sidemen.  Then the leader joins them in singing!  Immediately after which Dannie(Drums)starts swingn' and the rest of the group just explodes!!!<br />I would like to take this time to point out Impulse Records.  Every artist that has recorded with Impulse always seems to have a bit more fire, a bit more rockn', and a bit more soul.  The sidemen sound more inspired and there always seems to be a mystical energy that comes with listening to Impulse records.
0345345061|5.0|. . .of essays, short stories, poetry, etc. by the Master of Fantasy, JRR Tolkien.<br />In addition to a fragment of a play, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, etc., there is Tolkien's famous essay &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; which, in the mind of this reviewer, is the seminal work on what &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; actually are, how they are constructed -- and, most importantly, why people want to read and write them.  The concept of man as &quot;sub-creator&quot; and the ultimate longing for the Great Escape is explored, as is the final resolution in the Gospel story.  Surely a work of sheer brilliance.<br />As an example of how &quot;Fairy Stories&quot; work, Tolkien provides the reader with his short story &quot;Leaf, by Niggle&quot;.  Truly it is a gift.<br />Anyone who wishes to truly understand Tolkien cannot be without this volume.
0131103628|5.0|About 5 years into my programming career, I was mildly interested in learning C, so I picked up this book. At the time, I was deterred - it was very brief, terse, and confusing, so I put it back down again.<br />But now, years later, with many more languages under my belt, I find myself again drawn to C. So I picked up this book again (2nd edition), and finally, I see the light! It is a wonderful book, I agree with all the glowing comments people have written about it, BUT! It is a book written by a computer programmer, for other computer programmers, not a book written by a teacher for a beginning student.<br />C is alive and well, and still in use today - it lives &quot;at the core&quot; of most popular languages. You can see its influence on C++, JavaScript, even Visual Basic. If you are ready for it, reading and working through the examples in this book will provide you with a solid base for understanding an amazing variety of 'newer' programming languages.<br />You have to work through the examples, though. If you 'just read' this book, you'll comprehend and retain close to '\0' (null) of the information presented. It's only by going through the examples, that you really nail the subject matter. Yeah, I know, some of these examples are tough - but they're also real-life, and typical of routines every programmer writes and uses. I myself sweated blood over exercise 3-3, but hours later when I was done, the satisfaction of comparing my answer favorably to others was worth it. :-)<br />I have the C For Dummies books 1 and 2, and after going through them, I was still a Visual Basic programmer. ;-D If you already are a computer programmer, and want to obtain serious knowledge in C without wasting your valuable time, learn from this book.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|I've been waiting for this reissue with baited breath. EC's first album with the Attractions offers up some of his best work along with a bonus disc that truly compliments the original release. The songs on this album demonstrate EC's ability to write aggressive songs with substance. Although references to his early songwriting often get meshed together with the punk rock movement of the late 70's, his songwriting at this time happens to be a product of his undeniable talent instead of whatever trends were prevelant at the time. <br />EC's strength has always been in his ability to write insightful and often poetic lyrics. The fast paced nature of some of these songs may belie their depth yet it's hard to think of them arranged in any other way. \\"Radio Radio,\\" \\"Big Tears,\\" \\"Lipstick Vogue,\\" and \\"Pump It Up\\" are the obvious highlights of this set. On the surface, they seem like harmless pop fare, but each of these songs can be truly revealing and provocative in their own way.<br />I'm finding it hard to do these songs justice in words, but believe me, no EC would be dissappointed with this album. The bonus disc contains a few demos, which may be interesting to those who want more insight into EC's songwriting process, but the true gem is \\"Stranger in My House,\\" which is an excellent emotional tune that keeps itself from getting too sappy.
0767802659|5.0|Starship Troopers was a good space military movie but it cannot beat Star Wars if it ever became a formidable competitor. The basic story is, a swarm of giant bugs are trying to take over the world and it's up to an army of humans to stop the onslaught. Johnny Rico, wants to become a citizen by joining the Army. The same thing for his girlfriend, Carmen Ibanez. However, they become separate because Johnny joins the infantry as Carmen pilots spaceships. The movie shows propaganda and facist ways in the future, proving that democracy does not exist in this movie. In the psychological aspect, there's something that I don't understand. If bugs kill too many human ground troops, putting the humans in risk, how come they can't send bombers and space fighters more frequently? I have no clue why, but however, the movie has little resemblance of the book. If Robert A. Henlein was here to see this movie, he would be slightly disappointed because there was some things they skipped and the troopers, the spaceships, the bugs, and the scenery would look different.<br />Here's why I gave this movie five stars: <br />1. The action was pretty impressive<br />2. The bug animation was detailed and looked real<br />3. Good story to convince some viewers to see this movie<br />4. Good character developement <br />5. There's jokes in it.<br />Good movie but it could have been better.

B000023VR6|5.0|Bow down. This is it: Dr. Dre presents \\"2001.\\" The king of the West coast composes an album which is undoubtedly the best rap album of 1999 and most likely for the next following years. He and his super-producer Mel-Man produce the entire album, save for \\"The Message,\\" and Dre raps on the majority of tracks as well. And his flow is quite impressive. He's also brought an entire roster of rappers from the West coast and elsewhere right with him ... and they hold it down nicely. Xzibit's verses in \\"What's the Difference\\" and \\"Some L.A. (...)\\" are excellent, as well as Eminem's in \\"Forgot About Dre,\\" Kurupt's in \\"Xxplosive\\" and \\"Housewife,\\" King Tee's in \\"Some L.A. ...,\\" impressive newcomer Hittman in a number of songs including \\"Big Ego's,\\" \\"Bang Bang,\\" \\"Light Speed,\\" and \\"B**** N*****,\\" and of course the Snoopy D-O-G-G claims game on \\"The Next Episode.\\" This album is slammin'.

B00005UEAR|3.0|Although there are good moments, this album cannot measure up to &quot;Scenes from a memory&quot; on a lyrical front, or &quot;Awake&quot; on a musical front.  Both the lyrics AND the music seems &quot;forced&quot;.  The lyrics don't seem to have a flow (not every song has to have a catchy line, but once in a while would be nice).  Musically, it always seems that right when the music gets into a steady state, it is immediatly broken off into hyperbeat rifts.  This gets pretty distracting, especially on a 2 CD set.<br />Like others have mentioned, they whole &quot;insanity&quot; theme album has been beaten into the ground by other bands.<br />That said, the sheer talent of this band makes it an enjoyable album, just not up to the high bar they already set.
6305127638|3.0|I'm not sure of the \\"even sequel\\" rule (which stresses even-numbered episodes of Trek films as superior to the odd-numbered), but this flick was more entertaining than I would have expected from a \\"Next Generation\\" movie (and that's not even counting the horrible \\"Star Trek: Generations\\").  <br />In this episode (I meant movie!! I mean it!!!), the Enterprise again confronts the Borg - the implacable alien race of cyborgs committed to \\"assimilating\\" every intelligent race it meets (unlucky races find that their members are turned into drones under the command of a \\"collective conscience\\" while their technology and everything else about them is appropriated by the Borg). Despite destroying the Borg's ship, Captain Picard quickly realizes that even victory was futile: a Borg shuttle escapes the carnage and journeys back to Earth's pre-Federation past.  Halfway through the time-slipstream, the crew of the Enterprise catches a glimpse of their Earth having already been assimilated.  Realizing that the Borg have somehow changed history, Captain Picard leads the Enterprise through the rift and discovers that the Borg have journeyed to the moment where mankind achieved \\"first contact\\" with intelligent extra-terrestrial life.  Historically, the moment came when inventor Zephram Cochrane (James  Cromwell) first tested his revolutionary spaceship, one powered by the then unknown warp-drive, and attracted the attention of a passing Vulcan survey vessel.  The Enterprise destroys the Borg ship - but the Borg survive somehow manage to invade the ship and begin assimilating it.  With his crew reduced and his ship barely under his control in Earth's orbit, Picard leads the remnants of his crew against the Borg infestation.  On the ground, an away team meets with Cochrane himself and help him repair his experimental ship - damaged earlier by a Borg attack.  <br />I'm no fan of the \\"Next Generation\\" but this sequel was a surprise.  Jonathan Frakes's direction is tense and captures thefear the Borg inspire and the claustrophobia of the new Enterprise (this was the debut of Enterprise-E).  On the downside - the film never becomes more than an exceptional episode of a TV show, as opposed to the more cinematic films of \\"classic\\" trek.  The crew is inexplicably forthcoming with Dr. Cochrane and other denizens of the \\"past\\" - Kirk and company were a lot funnier trying to hide that they were from the future.  Also, Dr. Cochrane's mountain base is so remote, he might as well be set in the future himself - there's no frame of reference linking him to Trek's past aside from what the script just tells us.  The script also makes a critical mistake with the Borg by giving them a queen.  Though Alice Krige vamps sexily as the queen, it undermines the Borg as being a force of nature blind to the destruction they cause - now they're just a bunch of aliens having a technology that can't be stopped, and led by an evil ruler.  Also, the basic plot left me scratching my head, if the Borg had achieved time travel, would they really need to conquer Earth?  And as logical machines, how would they get past paradoxes of time travel?  All in all, still a superior \\"Next Generation\\" Effort.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is a work in its entirety as opposed to a collection of songs. This is Prince's \\"A Love Supreme\\". Starting with the Artist himself sandwiched between the jazz inspired African folk art on the cover, this is Prince's most vital work in years. Here is a story of the fall of mankind and his struggle to find truth in the haze of the \\"Digital Garden\\" he has constructed. But the story ends with a powerful message of hope and redemption aided by a gospel choir, a Martin Luther King Jr. sample, mock Opera, and Prince's wailing guitar and Najee's funkdified flute. These arrangements are tight. Prince makes use of air tight disonance in his jazz arrangments with some smoking horn riffs. Then he brings it down to tender acoustic guitar with rich vocal stacks teetering on top. As he sings the praises of the Word of God, unconditional love, injustices of our history, and living life to its fullest for not knowing when it will end,and sex, he moves with a very clear agenda. This is a man inspired to share his vision with anyone willing to listen. With music as well constructed as this, we all stop in our tracks. Finally, this legend of a performer has made a work worthy of his prodigious talent. Undoubtedly, it is the most passionate, thought-provoking composition of his career.
B00005U1YO|2.0|I've got every Chemical Brothers release and have been a big fan for years, but this CD is my least favorite by a long shot. Bummer. Uncharacteristic of their other stuff, this disc - to me - just seems to lack anything resembling melody, and instead ventures into repetitive, techno-trance house beats that drag on and on and on. I dunno. Maybe I just don't get it. I'd recommend listening to the previews before buying, even if you're a buy-without-listening fan, like I am (or was).
B00005RHGK|3.0|Movie Summary:  Bother sister duo Trish and Darry are driving home from college when they are driven off the road and spooked by an unseen driver in an old beat up truck. They calm down and proceed down the road. As they pass an abandoned church, they see the old truck and a cloaked figure throwing a body-sized package down a large pipe. Darry is intrigued and makes them go back. A decision that he soon regrets as their relaxing country drive deteriorates into a nightmare of unimaginable horror.<br />My Opinion:  I liked JC and found it to be entertaining. Sure it has some plot holes and fits easily into the teen horror genre, but isn't that what you wanted if you are renting or buying this movie? I liked the brother sister twist. Usually you have the boyfriend girl friend thing going on. Here we have a stronger sibling bond. It makes for some different points of view and situations. I thought Justin Long did a great job. I like him on the Ed TV show and it was cool to see him here. Gina Philips was also pretty good and she wasn't bad to look at. The Creeper was a cool character. They gave him a reason for what he did. There is also a bit of subterfuge as to what the Creeper is really after. When we find out what he really is I was a bit disappointed, but I got over it. In the end I was entertained and glad I rented it.<br />DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1  Sound: DD5.1  Extras: Multiple Making of featurettes, Deleted and Extended Scenes, Commentary, Trailer, Photo Gallery, Hidden Features  Menus: They change when you click the correct option!<br />What You Should Do:  See this if you are a horror movie buff. It provides a few new twists on the classic teen horror movie. Remember that this is a teen horror movie and set your expectations accordingly. Don't see it thinking it is something else. Until next time, I'll BEATNGU<br />Related Movies To Check Out:  The Evil Dead Series, The ReAnimator movies, Final Destination
0441008356|5.0|Bought this as an Amazon [.com] recommendation, and it delivered the goods, and then some. I love hard sci-fi, but am by no means a junkie of the genre, as I've got kind of a love/hate relationship with it... For my tastes, too many of the books in the genre spend too much time obsessing over the details of the author's futuristic ideas at the expense of plot progression, with boring, cardboard cut-out characters to give these ideas some kind of purpose. Not this book. Every aspect of this book's universe intrigued me, and left me wanting to know more.<br />The pacing is superb, the plot is rife with twists and compelling sup-plots. A richly diverse, superbly drawn cast of characters with their own agendas makes Revelation Space all that much more interesting. Unlike others here, I thought the ending was very cool on a grand scale, and leaves just enough unanswered to beg for a sequel. (Here's hoping for one!) One of the best sci-fi novels I've read in years. Very highly recommended.
0066620996|5.0|REVIEW:    How do you become \\"great\\"?  Well, you study what the great do and emulate them.  That's the point of \\"Good to Great\\".  This book answers the question, \\"How does a good company become a great company?\\"  The research team found 11 companies that met their stringent stock performance criteria exemplifying \\"good to great\\".  Then they collected, filtered and studied tons of data on these companies and determined the patterns that explain how they became great companies.  They distilled their findings in a fairly simple, easy to understand model having six components.  I'm very often disappointed with models used is business books (note: this is not just a business book) but the models used here seemed natural and didn't come off as forced or too clever.  While the book is based on very in-depth research, it does not read like a research report.  The author has done an excellent job at bridging the gap between first rate research and a mass market audience.  Many best sellers are \\"fad\\" books - this one is not.  Highly recommended for those interested in organizational excellence.<br />STRENGTHS:  Collin's writing is very interesting and easy to read with lots of real world examples and anecdotes.  The book is a quick read and many readers will finish it within a weekend.  While based on lots of research, the book does not read like a boring textbook.  The authors conclusions are delivered simply and concisely and chapters are summed up in key points.<br />WEAKNESSES:  Minor but: Too much focus on stock price as a measure of greatness (but what alternative was there?).  Charts are misleading because they are not logarithmic (distorts true performance).  Found the repeated phrase \\"If you would have put $1 into ___ in 19xx you would have $__ annoying.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  All managers, executives, and leaders of any type of organization as well as those others interested in organizational excellence.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  Of course, Built to Last by J Collins & J Porras.  Also, most themes in Good to Great have a lot of similarity to concepts of Peter Drucker - see for example, Managing for Results and On the Profession of Management.<br />[feedback welcome]
B00002E224|5.0|What a great movie. Like many people this was a movie that I stumbled upon to during late night channel surfing. I am not really a big fan of romantic-type movies but I decided to watch it. Wow am I glad I did.<br />The story begins when a young American man and a young French women meet on a train going from Budapest to Paris. Jesse, a young American man is getting off in Vienna to catch his plane back to the US, he's finishing up a vacation. Celine, the young French women is going back to Paris after visiting her grandmother in Budapest. They begin to engage in mutual conversation on the train and start to hit it off. After the train pulls into Vienna, Jesse convinces Celine to get off the train with him and check out Vienna. They spend the rest of the day and night talking and slowly growing more and more attracted to each other, they eventually fall in love.<br />As the movie progressed you slowly grow on and become more and more attached to the characters, they are very likeable and believable. I found myself thinking about the moment when they would inevitably have to bid farewell too each other. It's the type of movie that stays with you and you think about for days and days after. Richard Linklater did an excellent job writing and directing this movie, there very many memorable seens (if not all of them). I think my favorite seen if I had to name just one would be the fake phone conversation that they had in the restaurant, I loved that scene. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were born for these parts, they played their characters perfectly and very naturally. This is a must-see.
0875845851|4.0|REVIEW:  The author's key theme (my oversimplification) is that new technologies can be separated into &quot;sustaining technologies&quot; (for improving established products)and &quot;disruptive technologies&quot; (fundamentially new products or markets) and that while established firms do an excellent job at exploiting sustaining technologies, disruptive technologies often cause them to stumble and lose leadership.  The book explores the reasons why this has ocurred despite the established firms having good management and following good management practices.  For those who are Peter Drucker fans, I believe Christensen has independently found and expanded upon two Drucker concepts in a fresh and original way.  The Drucker concepts embedded here include: (1) key changes always start with a company's non-customers and (2) the &quot;new&quot; (e.g. a company's new products) should be developed separately from the old, should be sheltered, and should not bear the same burdens as the company's established products.    The book is based on solid research and is well written.  Highly recommended for those interested in high-tech manufacturing business strategy.<br />STRENGTHS:  The book is organized very well giving the reader the option of a quick read or a detailed read.  For example, there is an excellent introduction that summarizes the main points of the book.  Also, each chapter has detailed footnotes allowing the reader to go deeper into the material if desired.  The book has plenty of case studies and graphics to illustrate key concepts.<br />WEAKNESSES:  The book has a bit of an academic feel and is not written in a casual way as found in many popular business books.  This didn't bother me as I found the content first rate and very interesting.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Exectives responsible for strategy in technology product companies.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  Andrew Grove - Only the Paranoid Survive; Peter Drucker - Management Challenges for the 21st Century; Michael Porter - On Competition<br />[feedback welcome]
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is the worst example of a movie about the Pearl Harbor disaster that has been made.  I  am deeply disappointed that the youth of this time would be subjected to so much misinformation.  The only plausable fact in the movie is that Pearl Harbor happened.  Even the special effects are phoney.  My, my , all those gas engine prop airplanes moved about the screen as it they were jet aircraft of today.  The only believable special effects were the scenes that were &quot;borrowed&quot; form earlier movies about Pearl.  There are too many distortions to itemize.
0195067142|5.0|I first saw and heard Dr. Sledge describing the experience he had with trhe old Breed on the History Channel.. I waited three months for the book to get here.  I read the book, and then the other reviews.  This book left my heart so shocked and my mund so full of appreciation that I know that I cannot add enough words to the graditute I owe the men that went through what most Americans will never know.  It has already been said.  It can't be said with more sencereity, or in a more compassionate way.  To Sledgehammer, I say, I only wish so much that I had had the privledge to have known you personally.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The need for that.  That.  That.  That fire drill control, the horrible pattern.  I'm coming.  Life, my heart, my breath.  Wait (get dressed).  Just wait.  The sameness is so good.  The downness breaks my eyes (breathe, breathe).  The heartbreaking softness just grows to angels who want to scream, but hum in tune.  Perfect everywhere.
B000002MU3|2.0|Let me first say I am a huge REM fan; have been for about 14 years now. And I don't necessarily think Monster is a bad album. However, it is without a doubt their least impressive effort, and the lingering feeling I get when, on rare occasions, I put this album on is that either their collective creative juices had temporarily dried up during '94, or they'd got to a point where they just didn't give a damn.<BR>In its defence, Monster pulls out one or two great numbers. What's the Frequency, Kenneth? is an engagingly strange number carried on the back of a killer wave of ultra-distortion, and the tremelo guitar solo rocks. Peter Buck always stuns me for his ability to find that unique blend of sounding so familiar while still refusing to pigeonhole his playing style. Likewise, Tongue is haunting, seductive and beautifully placed in the middle of an otherwise guitar-heavy album. <BR>But they're the best of a pretty mediocre lot. Infact, the bulk of the songs on Monster sound so similar it's hard to tell them apart unless you know the album extremely well, and the last four or five are just plain forgettable. There aren't many more albums I know that tail off so poorly, REM ones especially so.<BR>REM toured Australia on the back of Monster in January 1995 and their concerts consisted of the bulk of this album, with about four or five older songs thrown in at the end. It was a huge disappointment, and I have to say that haven't been wowed too much by anything they've released since then, New Adventures in Hi Fi excepted (a brilliant piece of work for a collection of outtakes and soundchecks).<BR>Nevertheless, it never pays to be overly negative about REM's music. They are great musicians, with a wonderfully diverse back catalogue. The bottom line is Monster may not be as good as say, Life's Rich Pageant, Murmur or Automatic for the People, but it's worth buying if only as a case study of a band who decided an extreme aberration was a good idea at the time, and I respectthem for their refusal to get lazy and simply put out a clone of the award-winning album that preceded this one.
B000000HHE|5.0|There have been so many great things already written on this site about &quot;Three Feet High and Rising,&quot; but I'll gladly put in my own two cents.<br />I'm not really much of a hip-hop fan...I respect a lot of the better-executed stuff, but for the most part I can take it or leave it. This disc is the exception. It really blew the doors off the genre when it first came out in the late 80s and it doesn't sound the least bit dated (which says a lot since R&amp;B is very trend-oriented). The samples are brilliant. Using Steely Dan, Schoolhouse Rock, Hall &amp; Oates and more, the fun, innovative De La Soul incorporate old school sounds and new ideas in a way that has never been done before. I can never get sick of songs like &quot;Eye Know&quot; and &quot;Say No Go.&quot;<br />As if that weren't enough, this new reissue features a bonus disc of mostly remixes. Nothing fantastic, but how can you complain about a free disc?<br />If you're a hip hop fan, there's really no excuse to not own this. If you're not much of a fan, this may actually be enjoyable to you as well. Try it, it's good for you.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|I am a Bob Dylan Fan. Have been, will be, always. Name a Dylan alblum that I do not have and I want it.  The last Dylan alblum that I bought before this one was Empire Burlesque. A great alblum. This alblum is a tipicule Dylan batch of songs. Except that he is 60 years of age and sounds it. There are great songs still being write by Mr. Dylan.
0440219078|5.0|This is one of my favorite books, and I truly believe anyone who enjoys reading will enjoy this book, especially those who enjoy books such as 1984. The main character is Jonas who is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for his community. (The community is striving to be a \\"perfect\\" community and gives out life assignments to the children of the community when they turn twelve.) Jonas meets the Giver who is a truly remarkable old man who has all sorts of knowledge and memories which he passes slowly onto Jonas. No one else in the community has these memories of color, sleigh riding, feelings, etc. Jonas starts to hate the way his community is controlling the lives of those in it. He steals the child which his family was taking care of that was about to be destroyed and runs away. The ending of the book is very vague and ambiguous. It is up to the reader to determine Jonas's fate, and there is no right or wrong answer. Truthfully, I chose to go with a more positive ending. I believe he really did come across a town, not a memory, and that he will have the life that he so wanted, but others may chose to believe that it was just a memory he had before perishing. The ending is the only part of the book I believe may annoy the reader because it does leave the reader hanging and some people don't like that - some people need closure. Overall, what makes this book so interesting and intriguing is that it is very realistic. A situation like this could happen to us in the future. It's not too far-fetched and is a wonderful, non-boring read.
B00005OAIE|5.0|As for Mr. Mayer, his sound is awesome.  I first heard him on 99x (an Atlanta radio station) a couple of years ago and fell in love with \\"Why Georgia\\".  An incredible song.  I purchased his cd for just that song alone, and then discovered \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\", which then led into \\"Neon\\", which led into... You get the picture.  This is a great cd to listen to front to back.  Great job John.  I look forward to your next cd.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This DVD is awesome!  It was very informative for me, I wanted to find out what all had transpired since I just started watching on New Year's Eve when they had 12 episodes - one whole season - of Sex and the City on HBO.  Anyway, one of the things that sticks out is the way Sarah Jessica Parker's hair is always changing.  I think this is great for the personality she portrays.  You find out that Mr. Big was there from the beginning and you watch all these men go in and out of these 4 women's lives.  My husband was HOOKED, ladies.  He thought it was nice how the stories pick up where they leave off.  It is alot like opening a book when you pop this CD in your DVD player.  Awesome quality picture, we were very impressed with the clarity.  Hope this helps......
B00003Q43A|2.0|When I think of awful science fiction movies, three come to mind.  Plan 9 From Outer Space, Stargate, and this \\"gem.\\"  Written to the lowest common denominator, and unintentionally hilarious, this is as bad a science fiction movie as you can make with a hundred million dollar budget--except, perhaps, for Stargate.<br />Want to learn how not to write a screenplay?  What bad dialogue sounds like on screen?  How to insult the viewer's intelligence?  It's all here.<br />Will Smith can add this to his \\"bad\\" movies column, right next to Wild, Wild West (ugh).  Rent this just for a laugh if you're a glutton for punishment.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is thrilling, edge-of-your seat entertainment, but it not so subtly begs the examination of man's quest to create the perfect machine only to have his creation turn against him. This is expanded upon in T2 but the original appeals to me more because the viewer has to do the thinking. The icons and imagery are all there, but it doesn't detract from the action and suspensful aspects of the film. Don't misunderstand me; the sequel was great. Cameron had less to work with here and success was not assured. As for the presentation of the DVD, I can say that it's impressive. I remember the film being dark and grainy. The colours are rich and warm, considering much of the movie is at night. The deleted scenes are a bonus. I can see why they were left out, though upon viewing them they add much depth to the story. This is the only sci-fi movie I'd recommend to those who normally would not venture into the genre. \\"The Terminator\\" is a violent and chilling action film with spirit and humanity.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|After seeing the incredible Count of Monte Cristo, I looked up this film costarring Jim Caviezel hoping for an okay flick.  However, it definately exceeded my expectations!!!  Caviezel is John Sullivan, a young cop living in Queens in 1999.  His father (Dennis Quaid in a great performance) Frank was a firefighter who died thirty years ago in a warehouse fire.  However, John is given everyone's dream of getting a second chance to fix the past!! By some strange phenomenon concerning Northern Lights, John is able to talk to Frank in 1969, over his father's old ham radio, and on the eve of his father's death warns him that he will die tomorrow.  Although Frank is unconvinced that the voice on air is his son from the future, he \\"goes the other way\\" and escapes from the burning warehouse.  Not interested yet?  Because Frank did not die in the fire, his wife, a nurse, accidently saves the life of a serial killer.  Unfortunately, back in 1999, a horrified John discovers that mother has been murdered by the said serial killer in 1969!!!  It's up to John and Frank, in a father-son collaboration, to catch the killer and save their wife/mother before the killer gets to both of them first.  This is really an interesting and absorbing movie, and I guarantee you'll be hooked until the very end!!!*
B00005R87Q|4.0|I knew I would love this movie. It wasn't going to make me think and some movies are made to serve that purpose. The feeble plot revolves around carefree street racers who use their lifestyle as a facade for their bad-boy activites, which include hi-jacking trucks at 60 mph whilst clad in too-cool-for school black garb. If you think I gave away any of the plot, you're wrong. Even I didn't figure it out until it was blatantly obvious. Perhaps it had been obvious all along, if I hadn't checked my brain at the theater door. But as I said, I enjoyed it. Paul Walker's character of Brian might have been wooden and a total bore but Jordana Brewster was certainly nice to look at. A popcorn flick in top gear. Only speed-freaks need apply.
B000005H3A|5.0|In originality and beauty, this set is only surpassed by the great &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; a few years later.  If you own only one HH album, make it one of these two.  Takin' Off is awesome, from the wonder of &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; to the energy of &quot;Three Bags Full&quot;, &quot;The Maze&quot;, and &quot;Empty Pockets&quot; this set blazes forward with energy and crispness.  Absolutely essential.
0446608955|4.0|I thought this was an excellent book.  It was easy to read and flowed from page to page.  At the time I read the book my teen-aged daughter had her first \\"boyfriend\\"  I passed it along to her to read and she also thought it was great.
B00004NHCC|5.0|Is this not the most beautiful female voice you have ever heard? Sarah was such a talent and you can see why while listening to this famous recording. She knows 'where it's at'. Gorgeous songs and accompaniment along with her deep vibrato....put this on and slowly sink into your couch. With one of the swinging-est backing bands ever -including the late great Clifford Brown- this is sure to please.  One of the essentials of the vocal jazz canon, don't go without this any longer! Essential.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I was waiting this new album with anxiety, because I had bought the previous albums &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. These albums were really hits and tthey show an excellent style of Rock/Pop and spectacular lyrics. But the new album &quot;Rock Steady&quot; i guess it's an attempt of No Doubt to enter in something like an &quot;Electronic Pop&quot; including hip hoppers (like J.Lopez, J. Simpson or N. Furthado) for example Hey Babe.<br />I felt so dissapointed when i heard the album. In spite of all Gwen remains her lyrics out tthis wave of change.(listen  to Platinum Blonde Life)
B00003CXTG|5.0|... The movie industry is to entertain millions of people.  True this movie did not depict the events how they truly happened, but come on it does give the general idea as to how it all happened... <br />Spend the time it takes to watch this movie. Very good indeed. There are some slow parts and some things could have been left out. But I would give this 6 stars instead of 5.
0451527712|4.0|The book is good and I recommend people to read it. Make sure you read the introduction and preface; and also the Letters before you get to chapter one because if you don't you will get a bit confused in the story. The story was well written, but one thing is that it never mentions how he created the monster so it was a bit confusing. It is much different than what I thought Frankenstein was, or how they show him in TV shows or commercials. Other than that the story was good and I enjoyed reading it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|A beautiful movie that I almost walked out of after the first 15 minutes.  I have to admit, Roberto Benigni is so annoying, so over the top at the beginning of this film, that I was tempted to leave the theater.  Fortunately, I stayed.  This film is an incredibly moving fable that should be seen by both those who enjoyed &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and by fans of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.  For first time viewers, enjoy the first 15-30 minutes for what they are in context of the remainder of this moving film.
B00005B36H|5.0|When I first bought this CD, I was disappointed in it. I started to listen to it more and more, and finally, something snapped. Everything made sense, and I saw how amazing this CD is. As I listened to it, the music began to flow around me in a way that it hadn't before. Every time I listen to it, I hear something new. Just the other day I found out that the lyrics in Lateralis follow the Fibonacci sequence. Maybe there's a mathematical reason for the way the music seems to fit so well together, but it doesn't matter. This is one of my most listened to and loved CDs.
B000002KNU|5.0|Soon after emerging from the punk/alternative/new wave CBGB's Club scene in 1976, the Talking Heads released their amazingly authentic debut, \\"Talking Heads '77.\\" This exhilirating, inspiring debut album features the band at their most attentive, crafting every detail to the fullest. Foreshadows every direction the band's music will take, while capturing the sophistication (there's that word again) of their unique music. Although \\"77\\" was relatively disappointing on the charts and in commercial terms, it remains true that all great classics are brought to the light with time. \\"Uh-Oh, Loves Comes To Town\\" is just as unique as the Talking Heads themselves, while \\"No Compassion\\" shows the more grim, yet delightful side of their music. The purposely naive and satirical \\"Don't Worry About The Government\\" foreshadows the Heads' later cynical aspect. And \\"Psycho Killer\\" remains to this day one of the group's most effective and uneasy songs. And although there are many predictable (yet still unique) places in the content, \\"Talking Heads 77\\" is a remarkable, landmark gem deserving of attention.
6305499365|5.0|If you survive a commute every morning that makes \\"Soylent Green\\" seem like a paradise, only to spend your life in a cubicle doing entirely meaningless work that becomes obsolete before it's even finished and has no effect at all on anyone's life -- which probably describes 4/5 of Americans, since there are very few jobs outside of corporate America anymore -- then this movie is for you.  Mike Judge hits the bullseye on every aspect of cubicle life, and Ron Livingston, as protagonist Pete Gibbons, manages to say everything every cube-dweller wishes he or she could say: something that is real, not phoney; part of a meaningful life, not scripted, meaningless, business gibberish.  Every character is instantly recognizable and perfectly drawn.  The plot of the film is entirely beside the point; the characters and the situation would be hysterical no matter what the story was.<br />My only complaint is that the movie, which, if left to run in its natural direction, would be fomenting revolution, wimps out in the end, turning into a trite commentary on the fact that \\"most people don't really like their jobs.\\"  But the film practically begs for a much bigger, more provocative, and more profound interpretation.  It is a fierce commentary on the absurdity of modern life, but it ends up simply justifying the absurdity as existentially necessary and morally unproblematic.  Yet the reduction of human lives to ballets of banal and empty formalisms is anything but morally unproblematic.  But perhaps this kind of cowardice must simply be expected in modern films: \\"Traffic,\\" a scathing commentary on the absurdity of the drug war, wraps everything up neatly by asking us to put our faith in the curative powers of 12-Step programs, sidestepping the moral questions surrounding the right of the government to wage war on citizens who take drugs, and simply accepting the \\"crime vs. disease\\" terms in which the debate is conventionally framed.  Regardless of their implict meaning, it's probably unrealistic to expect Hollywood movies to end on a note that would make viewers think.  The social function of these films, after all, is to make everyone return to their cubicles the next morning a bit less resentfully.  Their economic function is to make a profit for the Bill Lumburghs of the world.<br />Serial format video, like Judge's \\"Beavis and Butt-head,\\" avoids these problems because it has no conclusion.  \\"Office Space\\" probably would have benefitted if it, too, could have avoided a conclusion.  Still, this one gets five stars because it's possible to disregard the last two minutes of the film and actually think about what it means.  Also, it's funny as hell.  And pay careful attention to Milton's mutterings.
B00005ATQE|5.0|If not the best film about war in general, then \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is undoubtedly the most vivid and realistic (if not sometimes disturbing) portrait of the Vietnam War. Based on the novel by Gustav Hasford (who also co-scripted) \\"The Short-timers,\\" the film follows an everyman, nicknamed Joker (played by Matthew Modine), from the hell of bootcamp, then to life as a military journalist in Vietnam, and finally to life in combat.<br />\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" contains the most realistic bootcamp sequence of any Vietnam War film, depicting the spiteful Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (the infamous role of Ronald Lee Ermey) and his cruel treatment of the Marines--particularly that of an overweight slip-up (Vincent D'Onofrio) cruelly nicknamed Gomer Pyle by the unbearable Sergeant. The film truthfully depicts how the recruits are trained to think (to kill). The descent into homicidal madness of Private Pyle is one of the most disturbing and unforgettable, yet unfortunately realistic, aspects of the film. In country, we meet even more soldiers who proudly dub themselves killers, grimly bringing to life Vietnam the way it truly was...without turning the entire film into anti-war propaganda. The image of a helmet with \\"Born To Kill\\" written on it with the contradictory peace symbol is the classic physical basis for the \\"Duality of Man.\\"<br />\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is the greatest war film of all time, not only because of its harsh realism, but oddly enough, because of what it does not attempt to be; glory films full of long speeches and cliched character studies. Truly contradictory in itself, one of its strongest qualities. Sheer brilliancy.
B00003CXXR|4.0|This film was much better than I expected, however, it still is far removed from the first JP film.  A creative plot to return the professor to the island, that lands the &quot;tourists&quot; in a heap of trouble.  If you enjoyed the first two Jurassic Park films, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.  It is very suspenseful, and introduces a whole new prehistoric fear in the &quot;hunted.&quot;
B000002A3T|4.0|Although I can't vouch for the album's lyrical quality, I can whole-heartedly say that Pink Floyd's 1994 studio effort \\"The Division Bell\\" could quite possibly boast the finest music writing since 1975's \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" Much of the album's musical excellence comes from the writing of keyboardist Rick Wright, who comes into full play on \\"The Division Bell.\\"<br />He was asked to leave the band in 1979 by Roger Waters (former bassist, principle songwriter), but returned for Pink Floyd's 1987 studio set \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" their first without Waters. Wright was brought into those sessions rather late in the recording process, so naturally his contributions didn't show much.<br />But with \\"The Division Bell,\\" we are introduced once again to the true musical capabilities of Wright and the rest of the band; notably the album's opening track, the instrumental 'Cluster One.' The music is incredibly tranquil, yet glazed with a hint of sorrow. Another instrumental, the Grammy-winning 'Marooned' (for best Instrumental Performance), applies to the senses, following the passion of each musician.<br />'Keep Talking,' a track in which the lyrics really disappoint, is kept alive by its entrancing music, giving the song an atmosphere all its own. Wright's musical talent on 'Wearing the Inside Out' speaks for itself with an appreciation for many different instruments.<br />All throughout \\"The Division Bell,\\" the listener is placed into a world of musical alchemy. But, unfortunately, the album has its disappointments.<br />Subtract one star for three flaws; (1. The dependance on 'outside' musicians. Though thankfully, the reliance on session musicians to write songs and perform isn't as near as heavy as that of \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" something about the fact that other people had to be called in to assist in writing the album causes its merit to pale in comparison to earlier works.<br />(2. The uninspiring lyrics. Maybe I'm just comparing them to the legendary Waters lyrics, but still, the music has to stand on its own.<br /> And 3.), the unceasing musical ego of guitarist David Gilmour, which attempts to out-do Rick Wright's work with (surprise) many drawn out guitar solos. This leaves the listener to sigh with relief when Wright saves the album with his tranquil atmospheric melodies. So, for any Pink Floyd fan, \\"The Division Bell\\" is a necessity. For fans of wonderful music from a great musical composer, this album deserves a listen to. But for cravers of great lyrics, try an older Floyd album instead.lyrics, but still, the music has to stand on its own.<BR> And 3.), the unceasing musical ego of guitarist David Gilmour, which attempts to out-do Rick Wright's work with (surprise) many drawn out guitar solos.

0790742322|5.0|Just hilarious... my favorite part is the dining room scene with all the singing and dancing!!!  Classic moment, not to be missed.  Winona Rider and Geena Davis are spectacular in this movie... and Michael Keaton is unbelievably funny!!  I couldn't stop laughing.  Great family movie... will keep you in stitches!!
B00005LB9O|4.0|The Good:<BR>As a reletively new listener and fan of Travis, I must say this band has intrigued me.  Travis is a cheerfull, innocent Coldplay with hint of Radiohead mixed in.  Thier 2nd album \\"The Man Who\\" really established this band as yet another great band from abroad. \\"The Man Who\\" is a legitimate 4 star album, and it is a  better album then thier newest release, \\"The Invisable Band.\\" Realistically, I give \\"Invisible Band\\" 3 1/2 stars.(I rounded up)  Like \\"The Man Who,\\" \\"The Invisible Band\\" is filled with countless catchy songs and addictive tunes.  Travis' albums keep their listeners wanting more. \\"Invisible Band\\" has this effect.  It's almost a continuation of \\"The Man Who,\\" in that there is no major changes in the sound and make up this album. <BR>Songs like \\"Sing\\" and my favorite \\"Pipe Dreams\\" are worth the price of this album alone. One listen through and I promise you will find your self humming the chorus of many of the songs without even knowing it.  Not shockingly good, but good none the less.<br />The Bad:<BR>\\"The Invisible Band\\" is a continuation of their last album \\"The Man Who.\\" You will find nothing out of the ordinary in this new album. Travis' stuck with the success of thier last album, rather then re-inventing their music. All bands must re-invent themselves at some point because the same formula doesnt always yield the same results.  I would have liked to see Travis evolve a little on \\"The Invisible Band,\\" but for now we just have to be content with more of the same. Hopefully, the bands next release will be a bit more original and less repetitious.
B00005U122|5.0|I first saw this concert on TV last year. I was mesmorized watching so much talent on one stage all at the same time. It was the first time I had ever seen or heard of Doyle Bramhall 11 &amp; I was hooked by his performance. I bought the DVD because I wanted to be able to see the concert over &amp; over whenever I wanted to. This is just a perfect combination of musicians &amp; singers &amp; they ROCK.
B000002NHN|5.0|The Good:  <BR>This album, better yet, this musical piece of art recieves a very rare 5 star rating from this reviewer. This album shows the many musical strengths of the underated and non-prestigeous Loreena Mckennitt.  \\"Book of Secrets\\" displays an array of celtic ballads that are filled with passion, beauty and strength.  Mckennitt is a more powerfull, more musically inclined Enya.  Where Enya relies on harmony and wonderfully hypnotic sounds, Mckennitt relies on the strength of her voice, her bone-chilling lyrics and the artistic use of strings, piano, and countless other well synchronized, melodic instruments.  This album will take you on a journey. It will lift your spirits and it will sink your heart. This is more then an album, it is an experience. <br />The Bad:<BR>Almost always I am able to find the \\"bad\\" to go with the \\"good.\\" In this case it is tough to search out a \\"bad\\" in something so \\"good\\".  Mckennitt is a celtic singer, and celtic music isnt for everyone.  Some people might find her voice to strong or may find her pitch to extreme. One mans beautiful voice is another mans headache. This is by no means an up beat, up tempo album and people looking for cheerfull, happy, dancy album should definately stay away.
B000002UAX|5.0|You can say what you like about Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road, the White Album is hands-down the best Beatles recording ever.  Its the songs that weren't hits that make this recording shine.  The wonderfully tender Julia brings out the then-rare tender side of John Lennon and I'm so Tired is like a smouldering fire.  While it can be clearly said that Paul ruled many of the later Beatles albums, this record is John's.  In fact, the only way to improve the White Album would be to remove the first track(back in the USSR) and let John's second track, Dear Prudence, be the opener.
B00005UEAR|4.0|I must start by saying that my tastes lean more toward progressive rock; I'm not really a Heavy Metal fan. With that in mind, I approached this album with some trepidation. I really liked SCENES FROM A MEMORY and CHANGE OF SEASONS, but I didn't really appreciate the earlier AWAKE album which was too 'heavy' for my tastes. With this new double album, I really wasn't sure which Dream Theater I was going to get.<br />While there is plenty of hard driving, metal sounding rock music here, there are also some thematic pieces in which one can sink their teeth. Disc 1 features five songs that run the gambit from metal to progressive. I find 'The Glass Prison' to be an overindulgent, bloated showpiece for the prodigeous musical abilities of the musicians. Sometimes less is more fella's; just because you can beat a drum or pick a guitar at the speed of light doesn't mean it's good or relevant music. Beyond it's freekshow appeal as an amazing show of dexterity, this song does little for me. Fortunately, the rest of disc one settles down a bit and offers some excellent songs. 'The Great Debate' offers some thought provoking lyrics and the band does it's listeners the courtesy of allowing us to make up our own minds on the issue.I appreciate that, as other bands will bludgeon you with thier point of view and, if you don't agree - screw you! DT know they have an intelligent and thoughtful audience and they don't talk down to us. The final song on disc 1, 'Disappear' is a beautiful and appealing song. Good stuff.<br />My hands down favorite song on the album is 'Misunderstood', which I continually find myself humming or singing right out loud. I would be most interested in learning the story behind this song. Depending on your individual perspective, the lyrics could be interpreted as the personal reflections of a diety, or a character study of the mythos of a comic book character.<br />Disc 2 offers a 42+ minute title opus separated into 8 movements. This song is in the tradition of SCENES, and is worthy of the progressive title Dream Theater has earned. As related in a lot of the other reviews of this album, it is an exploration of mental illness, I won't bother to delve into the deeper meanings and nuances of the songs; suffice it to say that the subject matter is interesting, the music is great and the performance is masterful!<br />Overall, an excellent CD and one I can recommend to long time fans and neophytes alike.ion of SCENES, and is worthy of the progressive title Dream Theater has earned.

B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot burst out onto the music scene without hardly any radio or mtv play, and they are hugely popular, bringing their fans along with their pulse pounding guitar and bass. The percussion on this cd is absolutely amazing, considering they have 3 of them. All 9 members wear masks, but that isnt what makes them cool. Their music is absolutely amazing. This cd shows what a good metal band can accomplish today. With hard songs like \\"wait and bleed, purity\\", or an even quicker song \\"spit it out\\" slipknot definately shows that they have what it takes, ask any slipknot fan, they will agree. And the best part about it is, Slipknot is all about the fans, so that makes their music that much better. This cd is a definate must for any metal fan.
B000050XEI|5.0|So we've walked the Marble Halls and seen the Orinocho Flow...now we step into the world on A Day Without Rain. This cd is amazing! I think this is Enya's most powerful album yet, as the music takes you on a journey, painting a picture with both sights and emotions. 'Only Time' will tell if I get this review finished later...
B00005QDW1|2.0|I've been watching No Doubt for 15 years now, watching their careers from dive-bar-club-dates-and-two-singers-kickin'-ska-band to the current force-to-be-reckoned-with-global-pop-sensations.   When I heard \\"Just A Girl\\" on the radio a few years ago, I freaked out and thought, \\"good for them, they've worked hard and made it\\".  Tragik Kingdom and Return to Saturn were both great albums that reflected not only the growth of a band but progression and morphing of sound as a unit.  Now we have \\"Rock Steady\\" and I am baffled.  What happened here, folks?  Tons of style (Gwen being a style guru) here, but no substance to be found.  I wanted to like it.  Really.  I did.  But I felt like I was listening to Britney Aguilera.  Maybe next album will be better.  I can appreciate the concept of testing new materials, but it only works when you can back it up with some substance.
0688172377|5.0|That Waris Dirie survived some of her experiences at all is amazing, but that she found success, love and happiness is practically miraculous.  She's lived so many different lives, ones that most people can only imagine - as a nomad in Somalia, as a servant in London, as an international super model - yet the voice in which she tells her story is so personal, so warm and informal, that she easily conveys a sense of what she has been through.<br />Waris literally ran away from when her father tried to marry her off to a much older man when she was thirteen.  After staying with family in Mogadishu, she goes to London to work as a servant with other relatives before being 'discovered' and going on to model.  Waris grew up totally and utterly isolated from the rest of the world  so much so that, when on a plane to London, she is surprised to see non-Africans because she did not even know that white people existed - and a lot of the book focuses on the radical adjustments she must make and how she feels - fascinated, frustrated, excited - about doing so.<br />Always just below the surface is the horrifying procedure of female genital mutilation or circumcision, which Waris underwent at the age of 5.  She continues to suffer excruciating pain as a result but eventually, after her initial embarrassment and reluctance, is able to discuss the situation with Western doctors and obtain some relief.  Her anger at what she and thousands upon thousands of African women have been through increases as she learns more about the world and realizes that not every woman undergoes the same torture, and she becomes a U.N. ambassador working to end female circumcision throughout the world.<br />Desert Flower would be a rewarding book if it were confined to Waris early years growing up in a nomadic culture.  But as it is, Waris' story is truly remarkable, and she succeeds in providing readers at least a glimpse into what she has experienced and endured.  One of the best aspects ofDesert Flower is its narrative voice, as Waris clearly uses one that is comfortable for her and that comes across as very personal, honest and warm.  I recommend this book most highly to just about everyone, as Waristriumph over her hardships, struggles, and suffering is fascinating while the fact that she maintains her sense of humor, faith and humanity is awe-inspiring.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is not only DM's greatest album, this is simply some of the greatest music. <br />Violator contains 3 good songs:<br />Sweetest Perfection<BR>Personal Jesus<BR>Blue Dress<br />It also contains these 6 absolutely fantastic songs:<br />Halo<BR>Clean<BR>Waiting for the Night<BR>World in My Eyes<BR>Enjoy the Silence<BR>Policy of Truth<br />This album is just excellent. This is some of the cleanest, purest, best written techno-pop ever recorded and it's just intoxicating, even after many listens. The voices are phenomenal and the production is mindbendingly perfect. This album will go down in history as *the* breakthrough electronic pop masterpiece of the 20th century. Well worth owning, I question whether one copy is enough!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|First, everyone knows the story of snow white by heart by now, so I won't go into plot detail, but the DVD of this film is a rare treat unto itself! If you're an extras junkie, you will absolutely adore this set. There's not one extra left out. If you could think of it, it's likely in there. What's better, the extras are very easy to manuever through, with two guided tours to help out. The film itself looks amazing, what with an extensive and thorough clean-up done. The sound is now top-notch, and carries through my home theatre system beautifully. This is how film classics SHOULD be treated, and this is by far one of the all-time great film classics.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Well,the problem with this CD is:She is NOT the same as she was last year or the year before,her singing is to adult.....But,anyway,there are a few great songs:<BR>     <BR>1)I am a Slave 4 U-3 stars,Ok but not that good,too \\"adult\\"<BR>     <BR>2)Overpertected-5 stars!this is one of the best ever!<BR>   <BR>3)Lonely-4 stars,You have too listen to it severl times,then it kindda grows on you!<br />4)Not a Girl,Not yet a Woman-5 stars,a Classic!this song is wonder full!not a silly love song,but notsinging aimlessly,it really has a meaning......<br />5)Boys-1 star,this is TERRIBLE!...<br />6)Anticipating-4 stars,Not bad!But it's dull,boring,and it keeps repeating 'till it ends.Yawn......<br />7)I Love Rock 'n' Roll-4 stars,Not bad,kinda cool!<br />8)Cinderella-5 stars!... this is one of the best ever!This is how she should sing ALL the time!...<br />9)Let Me Be-4 stars,maybe this should have had 5 stars,because it has a nice beat,cool lyrics,well,overall it is pretty good.<br />10)Bombastic Love-4 stars,I don't know about this one,awesome beat,greatsong,but I really don't like the Lyrics...mabye you should decide....
B00005AR3G|4.0|I admit I am a BIG Disney fan, which means I love most everything the studio does in animation. For some reason, however, I failed to see this film in the theaters. When it came out for home viewing, I rented it, watched it, took it back to the video store and ran out and bought a copy pronto! This is easily the funniest, not-taking-itself-seriously, enjoyable romp to come out of the Disney studios. From the opening selection screen with the dancing Kuzco, to Kronk's lovable idiocy, to Yzma's hysterical over-the-top rage, this film packs more than a few horse-laughs. I literally had to pause the screen a few times to stop laughing out loud so I could pay attention. It's not the Lion King, or Beauty and the Beast, but it's certainly worth having in your collection, right beside the best comedies you can think of!
B000007T1M|5.0|I really don't understand why this band is labeled as numetal.  Having listened to this CD, I can safely say that there is nothing on here that even vaguely resembles numetal.  There is no rapping, no turntabling, no simple 3-chord Korn riffs, and no indication that this album was made with any intention to get on MTV.  What I'm hearing here (if I can describe it) is something much closer to progressive metal, and even death metal.  System of a Down has much more in common with bands like Testament and Meshuggah than Korn and Limp Bizkit.  In fact, Daron, the guitarist, doesn't even like numetal, so I doubt he appreciates being lumped in that category.<br />As a person who never really got the whole numetal/rapmetal thing, and would rather listen to just about anything else, I always avoided this album, because I didn't expect it to be \\"my thing\\".  But, since I try to keep an open mind, I decided to borrow this album (and \\"Toxicity\\") from a friend, and just see if I liked it.  Wow, good move.  I am VERY impressed!  This album is nearly perfect in every way.  Very heavy, very melodic, and very technical.  Daron is far superior to any numetal guitarist, churning out wild time changes, thunderous riffs, and even some solos.  John Dolmayan is a very talented drummer, who can do way more than just pound absent-mindedly at his kit, like say, John Otto.  He does very complex beats, and some pretty impressive fills.  The bass player is nothing special.  His basslines are audible, but not very technical.  Then there's Serj.  The madman behind this masterpiece (there, I said it, I used it the \\"m\\" word).  Probably one of the most talented and bizarre vocalists there is.  He has an amazing voice, and frightening range.  He can go effortlessly from high-pitched squeals, to softer vocals, to death-like growling, and makes it seem easy.  The lyrics?  Well, I don't know.  Decide for yourself.<br />It's really a shame that most will only know this album by the single, \\"Sugar\\".  In my opinion, that song is extremely overrated, and easily the worst song on the album.  In fact, it's the only song on here that I dislike at all.  Not that it's bad, it's just significantly weaker than the rest.  If I had to pick favorites, I'd go with \\"Suite Pee\\", \\"War\\", \\"Mind, \\"PLUCK\\", and the haunting \\"Spiders\\", but every song is amazing in its own way.<br />If you have reservations about numetal, and because of it have not gotten this album, just forget that, because I gurantee you'd be hard-pressed to find anything even vaguely \\"numetal\\" about this album at all.  Anyone who has an appreciation for good music, and can keep an open mind will enjoy this.  Haven't listened to all of \\"Toxicity\\" yet, but something tells me it won't come within miles of this.  In fact, I doubt they could ever make another album like this.  Don't ask questions, just buy this now!  I also recommend \\"Chaosphere\\", by Meshuggah, if you liked this.y opinion, that song is extremely overrated, and easily the worst song on the album.

1559408855|4.0|I believe this movie must be seen by all fans of cinema. Certainly a film consisting of  rape, murder, urinating, defecating, torture and humiliation will be disturbing and downright sickening to most viewers, but the way that Pasolini potrays and weaves these acts of depravity into the story is truly brilliant.<br />To qoute a friend of mine who viewed the film (recommendation: watch this film alone) this is a movie that HAD to be made, because it gives an excellent reference point to how far a film can push the boundaries of acceptable viewing (acceptable as in disturbing imagery and story). Even though the movie is an attack on Fascism, to me the movie represented a step-by-step guide in preparing onself into the descent to Hell.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've heard in years and I think it plays to young and old alike- the sound is a cool, mellow, jazzy blend that sticks to your ribs. I think the Dave Mattews comparisons are way overblown. To put Mayer in a box with DMB and David Gray pegs him as unoriginal which is just dead wrong. It is his originality that is so inspiring!<br />I've burned a whole through this CD- it does not get old and I've passed it along to several friends, all who rave! Definately, a bust buy!
B00005N83M|5.0|Fans of Jennifers' first album \\"On the 6\\" will not be disappointed with this album. Jennifers collaboration with Latin artist Chayanne on \\"Dame\\"is reminiscent of her work with Marc Anthony,and like on her first album she enlist the help of a rapper (Ja Rule) for a little extra street credibility.The best tracks on \\"J.Lo\\" are:<BR> \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" ~ A sweet eerie dance song that is sort of like a follow up to \\"Waiting For Tonight (Una Noche Mas)\\"<br /> \\"Ain't It Funny\\" ~ A beautiful song sprinkled with Spanish guitars and castanets sounds like it should be the theme song for Romeo and Juliet because the lovers in this song feel they are meant to be but fate seems to have different plans.<BR> <BR> \\"We Gotta Talk\\" ~ Is a song in which Jennifer tells her lover that they need to talk in order to resolve some of the issues in their relationship or \\"tomorrow it could be too late\\"<br /> \\"That's Not Me\\" ~ Has some of the most beautifully haunting music and background vocals I have ever come across on a \\"pop\\" album.This song tells a guy that she is tired of his [ stuff ],she's tired of trying to baby him and she has been neglecting her needs for so long that she barely knows herself anymore and that's not her.This guy needs to reciprocate or he needs to leave end of discussion.<br /> \\"Dance With Me\\" ~ This is a really hot song with a really strange beat.There isn't a whole lot of dancing to be done to this but basically this is Jennifers observation of what is going on at the club and an invitation for you to \\"party til the sun comes up\\"<br />\\"Secretly\\"~ Sounds like something Janet Jackson might have done back when she was telling us \\"That's the Way Love Goes\\". In this song Jennifer is looking at a guy she is secretly lusting after and hopes he feels the same way about her.<br />\\"That's the Way\\"~ Is about having a crush on someone. In this song Jennifer vows that she \\"won't stop 'till I get what I want\\" and promises that she can make this guy happy and will give him anything if he promises he'll be hers.The song has a great sound and will make you \\"shake it\\" the way Rodney Jerkins urges you to during a break.<br />\\"I'm Real\\" (Murder Remix)~ This song is hot but if you notice that this cd has a parental advisory this song is the main reason for it but if you ignore that and just listen to the song you find that the gruff voiced Ja Rule and angelic sounding Lopez make a great team however when I first heard this song I was a bit confused as to whether this was an \\"I'm sooo happy without P.Diddy\\" song or an \\"accept me for who I am song\\" but minus the constant cursing and the initial confusion I really like this song.<br /> Recieving honorable mention are \\"Dame\\" and \\"Si Ya Se Acabo\\" which both sound really great but if you aren't fluent in Spanish these songs will have you searching for a Spanish dictionary.Also recieving honorable mention is \\"Carino\\" a song with a great Latin rhythm and Spanglish chorus.<br /> Jennifer Lopez and her team of producers,writers and guests put together a fantastic album that includes a song for almost each aspect of life and still keeps you dancing.\\"J.Lo\\" will be a very nice addition to your cd collection.
6304331851|5.0|I liked &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967), with Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave, and Franco Nero.  On it's own, it is very good.  The stars do their best, and that's saying alot.  There are no &quot;wink-wink, nod-nod&quot; hints toward JFK and that &quot;Camelot&quot;.  The songs are memorable, and were probably sung by the actors themselves. The film never seems too long, or too short. The location setting looks like long-ago England, and France.  The stars act and sound like people from long ago, not as though they time traveled from the 1960's.  It is a great combined tale of people who, on the one hand who probably did live in the past, and at the same time, are the stuff of legends. It is also the story of important people centuries ago who had the same human failings as the people of today do, even you or I. Where the film falters, thru no blame of the movie's actual stars, is in comparrison to the Broadway actors. Richard Burton, Julie Andrews, and Robert Goulet. Mr. Harris, Ms. Redgrave, and Mr. Nero are just not in the same ballpark. Comparing the play's cd to the movie's cd only shows how much better the theatre's performers really were.  When asked to star in the movie; Richard Burton said no; then J. Andrews said no, then probably everyone else in the play said no; which made the movie producers have to recast all the parts. The movie casting department did a wonderful job, but, I hope, someone had a video tape of the original Broadway cast doing the play.  I do recommend seeing the movie, on VHS or DVD.
1587990717|5.0|This book is unsettling because it asks questions that have no answer. Yet these are questions worth asking: how do we derive our knowledge in the presense of randomness. It strikes at the fundamental problem of knowledge. Taleb seems to carry Popper to its absolute limit. This is not a business book. Look at the more technical document on the author's web site on the structure of &quot;uncharted&quot; and &quot;untamed&quot; stochasticity.<BR>I wrote my thesis on Pareto-Levy distributions, much to the annoyance of academics seeking problems that have a solution. I think that one needs to have the intellectual courage to look at these problems. Sadly, aside from Mandelbrot &amp; Taleb very few thinkers do.
B00005Y7AW|4.0|I do not yet own this album but plan to as soon as the next paycheck rolls on in...<br />But I am writing this review because I saw Rufus live... at The Recher Theatre in Towson, MD. <br />The first time I had heard about this young man was when the movie \\"Big Daddy\\" came out. My best friend and I both owned the soundtrack, which features a Rufus song called \\"Instant Pleasure\\". I really had no clue who this person was and didn't really have any further interest in finding out.<br />Then when \\"Shrek\\" came out, he also had a song on there called \\"Hallelujiah\\" which I enjoy very much for his soothing voice and beautiful instrumentals. I thought I should check this guy out. My friend recomended I listen to \\"Evil Angel\\" and \\"Poses\\". I did, and they're great. (Evil Angel was a mind-blower when it was performed live.)<br />I'm not really into any kind of particular category of music so I'm not really sure what kind of music fan you would have to be to enjoy this...but I can just say that if you like deep, well-written music, maybe bands like Radiohead, you might just want to give this one a try. <br />He performed all of the above mentioned songs at the concert, many others off of his first album and this one, including my new favorite \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\", and The Beatles' cover \\"Across The Universe\\" from the I Am Sam soundtrack.<br />So maybe your friends haven't heard of him yet, but I guarantee you won't be sorry if you purchase this album, I know I won't be!
B00005RFAI|4.0|I listen to this particular CD nearly everyday.  There are some great upbeat \\"wake yourself up\\" songs (\\"Get This Party Started\\" \\"Respect\\")..but there's also the songs that go a little deeper into Pink's thoughts (\\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\", \\"Misery\\")  It's great to see someone who's not afraid to say what they're thinking. Granted..some songs may not be for younger listeners..but I think one song in particular \\"Family Portrait\\" is a great anthem for all the kids who have had to deal with a divorce.<BR>\\"Eventually\\" is another one of my favorites because of the interesting way she looks at fame, and she puts across how most people will feel at some point in their lives...used and unappreciated..<BR>ROCK ON PINK!!!
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel is a classic rock and roll artist.  His music is easy to listen to and the words are meaningful.  I really enjoy the different styles of music that he plays.  If you like to bring back some memories of the good ole days, this is the music to get.  My kids like to listen to this music which makes the generation gap seem much smaller.  This is a great volume to add to your collection.
B00005QIPH|2.0|This C.D. is too old fashioned. To many relaxed beats. If you like slow 80's stuff then here is the excellent disk for you. I like the heavier stuff so I'm not very impressed buy this. But you have to give them credit for trying. Thats why I rated this 2 stars.
0876855575|5.0|Bukowski is the type of writer who invites you out for<BR>a drink to his favorite bar and the next thing that you <BR>know it's two years later, your swimming in your own vomit<BR>and and living in a dive hotel right out of one of your<BR>very worst nightmares. But, he sure can write. Compare<BR>this book to Down and Out in Paris and London by Orwell.<BR>Why is it that Bukowski is not recognized for what he was:<BR>a great American poet and purveyor of folklore <BR>chronicling the exploits of society's eternal misfits?
B000004286|5.0|Braveheart is a masterpiece at all levels. I remember seeing the movie in theatres and being blown away by the directing, the acting, and of course the music. This soundtrack is one of the best and one of Horner's best!<BR>   Main Title is a beautiful track that includes some great bag pipes. A Gift of a Thistle is a short but a very nice introduction of Muron's love theme that is developed further in the Wedding cue. The Secret Wedding is one of the best cues on the disc and includes a more drawn out version of the Gift of a Thistle cue. It starts very softly and builds to a great climax. Revenge is a great underated cue that build some much suepense even when you aren't watching the movie. Sons of Scotland starts out with some great percussion work and then works on Wallce theme, that becomes grand and heroic as Wallace begins to rally the troops. Battle of Stirling is the best battle cue of the soundtrack and has a buildup that is very satisfying. For The Love of a Princess is the best love theme in the movie and stands as another great cue on the album. Betrayal and Desolation is a very good cue that accents the Betrayal that Wallace feels as the King sells him out. Then comes &quot;Freedom&quot;/The Execution/Bannockburn which is a great combination of themes that is a very beautiful. And End Credits is a nice ending to a wonderful soundtrack.<BR>A must have for all soundtrack fans!
B000024D4R|5.0|I have tried to write a review for this album at least ten times, but I can never seem to find the right words to describe it. This is mainly because I consider Dark Side of the Moon the most perfect music ever put to tape (and have said so in my review of that album), yet I think that Animals is better. So I have to keep asking myself if I am being hypocritical by saying so. I mean, how can you possibly get any better than perfect?<br />So I guess I need to explain myself. First of all, when I say that Dark Side is perfect, I mean it in the sense that not one note, word, sound effect, etc. is out of place. It is the perfect concept album, a bunch of excellent songs working together to make for the most incredible listening experience ever created. Animals, on the other hand, is completely different. Although it is most definitely a concept album, each song works on its own, as well as within the context of the entire album (those familiar to Dark Side know just how strange it is to hear \\"Any Colour You Like\\" on its own). <br />That is just a hint of how good the songwriting is on Animals, both lyrically and musically. \\"Dogs\\" is just absolutely incredible from start to finish. Roger Waters is at his lyrical best here, perfectly combining the the poetry of Dark Side and Wish You Were Here with the bitterness and sarcasm of The Wall & The Final Cut in his attack on the business world (most specifically the music industry). David Gilmour's guitar work is some of his best ever, taking center stage with an incredible harmonized melody that is as easy to sing along with as the vocals. Each transition from one part of the song to another is perfect all leading up to the grand finale giving a lyrical overview of the \\"Dog's\\" life and death. The best written song in the history of rock. Period.<br />\\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is another simply incredible song, attacking politicians and censorship. Its soft keyboard intro gives way to a mid-tempoed rocker that features someof Waters' best bass grooves (his lyrics have always overshadowed how good of a bassist he really is, throw on the headphones and see for yourself), and finishes with a soaring Gilmour solo that threatens to strip the paint off your walls. \\"Sheep\\" rocks out more than any Floyd song (with the possible exceptions of \\"The Nile Song\\", \\"One of These Days\\", and \\"Not Now John\\"). Its semi-walking bassline and crashing guitar & drums create the \\"Hammer of God\\" thunder & lightning effect the band was searching for, while Waters attacks the religious and easily influenced.<BR>Pigs on the Wing just puts the icing on the cake.  It is amazing how the same basic song can so perfectly open and close an album by itself.  A masterpiece.
B00005ATQD|4.0|I would like to restrict my comments to the film itself and not to the quality of the DVD. The mixed reviews on this film left me puzzled after I first saw it. I feel this is a very complex film and people do not like things that they don't understand. It is open to several interpretations. The whole film has a dreamlike quality to it. Is what happened at the party a reality or just imagination? Was Nicole Kidman's appearance at the party just a coincidence? There are many questions and few answers. But after all isn't that what makes a film fun?, something that makes you wonder, makes you think. Everyone now wants in your face entertainment. No one wants to search for answers. I find this type of entertainment stimulating. This is a film that is typical Kubrick, long range shots, lots of color and rich in vivid imagery. This is a fine end to one of the great film careers that any producer, director has ever had. Even though Kubrick's output was not by any means huge, he has left us with a rich and wonderful film legacy.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|When this movie first came out I did not see it, I bought it on Pay Per View and realized just how beautiful this movie is and that it deserved all the awards it got at the last awards show.  If you like musical films, you will either like it or love it.  I look forward to seeing this movie again!  The music works well in this movie as well!<br />BEAUTIFUL LOVE MOVIE!!!
0848801571|5.0|Childhood's End is the kind of book that, when you finish reading it, you sit and stare at the wall for ten minutes because you can't completely wrap your mind around everything that has happened. Then it hits you, and you buy every Clarke book you can find. Childhood's End is the author's apocalyptic vision of humanity's future. In the book, the author shows his hesitation for man to go plowing through space not knowing what dangers it may face. That, I think, is the message Clarke is trying to convey with this story.  If you want a completely original Sci-Fi, you definitely need to go get this book.
B00005QFHG|4.0|An excellent film, the storyline is a little weak, but the quality of the actors, especially Juliette Binoche and Dame Judi Dench more than make up for that. Filmed in France and England, (by the way the river was actually a lake in a small village in Wiltshire, England where I played as a child, hence the title of my review)<br />A most enjoyable film for all the family.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I personally feel this trip though the mind of an insomniac portrays possibly the best movie ever.  Just remember the first rule of Project Mayhem is dont ask questions....just buy this dvd.
0792156684|3.0|First off, I would like to caterwaul I am tired of all of humanity revealing their knowledge of what happened and what did not happen in 1912. <br />Wait, wait, wait. Before you begin to detest my opinions, I'm not saying that you are all unknowing dolts--you probably are right. <br />Sure, thinking about it, it seems like 1912 was a time when most people obeyed properly and went along with strict protocals of all sorts. But there had to some who did not, right? It would be impossible history is that unalloyed. That's what makes recreating it fun.<br />People spat back then, I assume. They rebeled, like Rose. (Haven't we all spent enjoyable hours reading up on revolutions and such?)<br />That leads us to another point: If Rose was a rebel, I'm sure the romp she and Jack took place in in the car could have went on. <br />Dismay! People do not realize the middle finger gesture went on since the 1800's. In fact it was present in acient times.<BR>Especially for the rich. If Rose was as jaunty as she seemed sometimes, hey, why not? (Whether she would have or not, it's<BR>hilarious it's in there because of the controversy.)<br />And after all, aren't movies movies for the variant people they protray? So there, I give one star to it's diversity of characters.<br />Besides all that, the paper of Rose's charol drawing, as useless as it may have been could have survived 84 years, many documents on Titanic did. One man's bus ticket was retrieved from his wallet. !<br />My second star falls into place because of the cinematography, admirable costume design, the music, ect., ect. <br />The third star is for the second half of the film, the depition of the Titanic immersing. But oddly enough, the second half is<BR>stoned down much by the first.<br />Why, oh, why is there the need for that extensive first (half hour is it?) of deep-sea diving? I'm sure you thought it was amusing, Cameron, but why put us through it, seeing it on screen?<br />Alrighty, after that we are introduced to Rose, 101. Why? <br />Why not began the movie with young Rose boarding the ship? We'll learn about Jack and Cal as it progresses! This fragment also allows the rest to be screwed up, because how does Rose know what's going about the ship when's she's not present?<br />The film advances into an effusive chick-flick, girl can't stand society, falls for thrid class boy after he \\"saves\\" her, they discover \\"true love\\" and yadda, yadda, yadda. (I know I said the rebellion part in characters is agreeable, but over too much gushy luv it looses it's touch, if you know what I mean.)<br />Not to disreguard: The script. No body speaks like that, 1912 or not. <br />Think, if this movie was nothing but the first half, not even one star would be in it's favor. It wouldn't even get produced.<br />So as a consummation, the ending with the ocean liner dying--that's what made it. It relied on speical and visual effects.<BR>But in a way we loose a sense of completion.<br />Such a naive beginning does not go hand in hand with the imposing end. This was not a homage to Titanic. It was soely about Rose and Jack. Should have been named something more along the lines of a sappy V.C. Andrews novel, such as \\"The Heart of the Ocean.\\" <br />A story about Titanic would be a story about someone related to the Titanic, maybe? We'd see more of the ship, and possible get more of a story, I wager. <br />As another result, what made this movie again was the last hour or so, which is the most lavish, exessive, documentary of the Titanic, or anything for that matter, ever made, since it did not really connect with the first half. I mean, Rose and Jack, two ordinary fools aboard? That's it.<br />The acting was adequate. Gloria Stuart was my personal favorite, even though her character was almost out of place. I get often tired of Leonardo's drollery, though. Billy Zane's eye-makeup is enough to drive you mad. Kate Winslet was as well enough to impel you to go insane with some card board acting, but over all I suppose she earned her nomination. (?)<br />Also, I must remark: This DVD. Where's the features? The deep-dive behind-the-scenes peek? (Hehe) Well, and I say quite prudishly, you think the biggest movie of all time would have more than just the trailer.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is the most beautiful, perfect groups of songs I have ever heard.  Though I've been listening to it for over ten years now, I have never tired of a single song.  This may sound dramatic...but across a variety of genres and eras, Astral Weeks remains my favorite all-time album.
6305841861|3.0|RELIEVE SOME TENSION!<br />I can't think of any other film that will make you limp like this one will!  Watching this movie (DVD) will take away all your problems, cares, and worries for at least a couple of hours.  <br />It might make a good bedtime story for some people, for sure.<br />Most of the time I write about DVD quality because other folks care to discuss plot points.  Please understand that's why my ratings often appear low.<br />The picture starts out pretty flaky but improves in dark scenes, which are most of the film.  It's not the best picture, especially for 1987.  Maybe they filmed this in 16-mm; I don't know.  <br />Sound is the real treat here, so you'll want to blast away and maybe have your windows open on a hot summer night.  Your neighbors will flee, for sure, after hearing this soundtrack!  The fidelity is not deep, but there are moments of great surround treats and they are usually gore-related.  However, there are not enough audio mixtures like this in the whole film to merit another star.<br />What's better than the film is &quot;The Gore, The Merrier&quot; featurette.  It's amazing what these men and women did.  This really enhanced my appreciation of the film, although it's by no means a Dario Argento classic giallo nor like an American thriller.<br />Like I said, if you want to relieve your tension -- plus have your senses knocked silly, this is for you.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I have not wanted to hurl my lunch at the screen this bad since I watched Steven Seagal direct himself in On Deadly Ground. This movie is a stupid display of testosterone overload. I thought that Vin Disel was good in Pitch Black so I thought why not? Wrong! I am embarrassed to say I even bought this DVD!
B000002AV5|5.0|As a lover of fine music I hope more people will appreciate her range, her voice that I personally enjoy. I listen to her when I feel bummed-out, it goes away and I fall in love with her again. <BR>Reminds me that God does give us angels to make us feel good when life/moods changes us and we forget to love one another.<BR>Sorry I drifted off the subject this collection is one good album there may have some &quot;okay&quot; tunes then the favorites kick in and all is well. Sade is a true artist that let's her voice and character speak louder then these other so called divas ever will have,the lady that doesnt need the hype to be known or heard.
B00005Q5AY|5.0|This is almost &quot;progressive thrash&quot; given the extra-class guitar work of Jeff Waters, the intricate arrangements of every theme, the polished production, the elegance and mystery spread all along this CD, and the wonderful compositions and lyrics here contained. You'll find in this release rough vocals over a precise machine of playing music, sustained by a virtuous guitar soloing and riffing, and also touched by a perfect bass playing and drumming. &quot;The fun palace&quot;, &quot;Sixes and Sevens&quot; and &quot;Imperiled Eyes&quot; are probably amongst the greatest metal pieces ever written! I give to this CD five stars, and recommend it to anyone wanting to be initiated to the thrash metal genre. This is a MASTERPIECE, and if you are serious about music I'm sure you'll appreciate it in all its majesty. By far, one of the best metal albums of all the times!
B0000508U6|4.0|Sure the bends-era radiohead comparisons are a bit much, but radiohead themselves needed to hit their stride a bit before they came out with an album that good. There's nothing particularly innovative here, just some really slow melancholy brit pop (most irritating music genre name ever somehow, but I can't think of what else to call it), but they're pretty good at it. Aside from the title track, which is pretty but too short to really go anywhere, and \\"yellow\\", which although overplayed and the one song where the vocals sound most like dave matthews, is still pretty good (albeit maybe a little cheesy), these are all pretty solid well-written tunes. \\"shiver\\" and \\"trouble\\" (neat video for that one too) stand out in particular. The whole album does have an overly midtempo feel to it, which can bore if you're not in the mood, but it's great to put on if you're stuck inside in the rain on a dreary day.
B000000OUW|2.0|The razor-sharp axework of the excellent guitarist Karl Logad and the sincerity of Manowar's themes don't save this CD. Eric Adams vocals and Joey DeMaio boring bass lines actually ruin this album, which should never be compared to the high flies of &quot;Kings Of Metal&quot; and &quot;Fighting The World&quot;. If you want to explore Manowar, take the aforementioned albums instead of this one. What happened to Adams' voice? It sounds broken, finished... It's a shame listening him, as you won't identify this voice with the one that sang &quot;Stand And Fight!&quot;. Drumming is also second-class rated -Well, I admit that Manowar had never had a extra-class drummer. The production is flat, and the sound is outdated and unexciting. I can't stand so much monotony! Why so many 5 stars? Go for something better and do yourself a favor: overall, this is a poor album, and I encourage you to avoid purchasing it. Two stars is by far a gift to this release!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Not to take away ANYTHING that has been said about this movie- it's a truly remarkable piece of film.  But, perhaps us consumers who pay so high a price for something that costs distributors and manufacturers a tiny fraction of what we shell out are spoiled by DVD &quot;extras,&quot; but i must say that there are slim pickings (or pique-ings) amongst the extras on this DVD.  If you're not interested in paying 20 bucks for something that costs less than a video to produce but costs you more to buy...than this is for you.  Otherwise stick with the widescreen VHS version or eagerly await a &quot;Special Edition.&quot;
0140288503|5.0|In a word, intense.  Black Hawk Down places the reader alongside a relatively small group of drastically outnumbered soldiers engaged in relentless combat, against an enraged and well armed foe.  This well written book provides a sense of the tremendous courage and bravery that was put forth in an extremely dangerous and harrowing endeavor.  <br />Ultimately, this book is a tribute to those soldiers who risked their lives and those soldiers who lost their lives.
B000001FI7|5.0|This is one of the most important debuts of not just the 90s, but of all popular music. When they arrived on the scene Portishead managed to give the world a completely original musical statement. The only other debut of recent memory that is equally important is &quot;Grace&quot; by Jeff Buckley.<br />Everything about &quot;Dummy&quot; shines. Beth Gibbons' vocals are exquisite; she sings with great feeling and honesty. One caveat, however, is that you may not like her voice if you don't like brooding, &quot;depressing&quot; vocalists. The musicianship is also wonderful; Adrian Utley is a great bass player who has since collaborated with many other artists of note. Geoff Barrow is also terrific as well as crucial to the overall sound. The songs are first rate in composition, arrangement, and execution. <br />I find myself repeating this statement in every album I consider to be perfect, but here it goes again: the songs create a unified musical statement even though they are capable of standing on their own. The sequencing is perfect and there is not a mediocre song here.<br />One last note: where I find &quot;Blue Lines&quot; to be a good but overrated album, I think that this IS the quintessential album of the genre that one might very loosely call &quot;Trip-Hop.&quot; It is impossible to understand the importance of electronica in the mainstream without listening to this...countless times.
B000021YQV|4.0|When system of a down's self title came out in 1998, I was most impressed with Serj's scream and the original songs that came out. The songs were fast and Serj's scream hit every song like bullets. I picked up this cd after hearing it off a friend. <br />This album &quot;Toxicity&quot; is much more instrumental. Serj uses his voice more and Darren sings as well in Chop Suey and Needles. This album is much more wacky and different sounding than the first album. Songs like &quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;Phsycho&quot; jumpy songs that don't capture as well as the other songs but &quot;deer dance&quot; and &quot;jet pilot&quot; not to mention &quot;X&quot; are catchy songs. <br />This cd is great if you would want to hear Serj's voice and how he dramatically uses it in his poetic lyrics.
B00004RF98|5.0|Okay, so I'm just another tree in the forest of voices, but I have to sing my praises for this film along with everyone else.  There's a joyous innocence about it that you can't help but fall for; watching it just makes you feel good.  It does have flaws, but they're all part of the charm: some of the lines are kind of hokey and Gene Kelly's a bit of a ham (but that's the Lockwood character coming out), but he's so handsome and he's got such a great smile that I'm more than willing to forgive him for it.  <br />Favorite dance numbers: <BR>Moses Supposes - I never get tired of watching this one.  The only problem is that it's too hard to figure out whose legs and feet to watch.  I usually watch Gene's, but Donand O'Connor is almost as good.  His dancing comes off as being a little bit &quot;lighter&quot; than Gene's, I suppose because he's a smaller man.  <br />Singin' in the Rain - sheer, ebullient, childlike joy... It makes me smile every time to watch Gene Kelly play in the rain like no one else can.  It's sweet and whimsical and just plain PERFECT.<br />Make 'em Laugh - What I love about this is the part where he sits down on the sofa and flirts with that dummy.  And I love how he turns his face into rubber (before Jim Carrey was even born!) and plays with that scrunchy little hat.  The part where he's rolling around on the floor gets a little old after a while, but I can't resist anyone who can do backflips off of walls.  I've watched this at 1/8 speed on my DVD player and it's absolutely amazing.  <br />The Broadway Melody sequence doesn't bug me anymore.  The best parts involve Cyd Charisse, especially when she's wearing that green dress and knocking Gene's socks off.  <br />Good Mornin' is pretty darn good, as is Fit as a Fiddle, though it isn't given much of a spotlight in the film.  That part where they crouch way down and kick their legs straight out is incredible.  Have any of you ever tried to do that?  I tried to do just one leg kick like that and I embarrassed myself; I can't imagine doing it over and over again.  It requires amazing leg strength and coordination.  <br />My favorite lines are usually uttered by Lina.  Her best scene is when she's being wired for sound and can't seem to speak into the microphone no matter where they put it.  Don has a good line early on when he chases after Kathy Selden and meets up with the other chorus girls in the dressing room.  One of them says, &quot;Anything I can do?&quot; in a very flirtatious tone, and he says, &quot;I don't have time to find out.&quot;  <br />These are just my random thoughts.  Watch it and feel good.
0380715430|3.0|The critiques of \\"The Mother Tongue\\" on Amazon.com illustrate the Internet's great value.  Left-wing carping that the Net has been coopted for commercial purposes is wrong.  It misses the point that the Internet is the greatest research tool ever devised, and not just for commercial ends.<br />On page 46, the author of \\"The Mother Tongue\\" writes that Frisian, a close linguistic relative of English and Dutch, \\"has been so little altered by time that many [Frisians] can, according to [a] linguistic historian . . . , still read the medieval epic _Beowulf_ `almost at sight.' \\"<br />Knowing that old English, in which _Beowulf_ was written, is essentially foreign to modern English, I was skeptical that it could be that accessible to modern Frisian speakers.

B00005N919|4.0|I never tire of this film. Seen it a number of times. It's an excellent story with some very fun characters.     Michael Douglas is perfect as the dark, recovering drug and alcoholic edgy cop, Nick Curran, who falls for the wrong person. Nick is continualy in trouble with internal affairs and has a very bad habit of shooting his weapon and killing people on the job. He is nicknamed, with strong affection, as \\"Shooter\\".    Sharon Stone's film career flew after the release of \\"Basic Instinct\\". What a great role for her playing the sexy, manipulative, dominant, intelligent, and seductive Catherine Tramell. Director Paul Verhoeven calls her a devil. She might be. Her eyes are amazing. You never quite know what exactly she is thinking.    Douglas is in charge of finding the killer of an aging rock star. His search leads him to Stone and there the cat and mouse game begins. Douglas and Stone's characters both lie, cheat and manipulate the people around them throughout the movie, all to maintain the upper hand. They have much in common, which leads to a torrid, hot love affair. As the stakes grow and the body count gets higher, the final conclusion leaves you scratching your head and questioning \\"who exactly is the killer\\"? To this day, my friends and I still debate as to who the real killer is. In Paul Verhoeven's commentary, he says very plainly who the killer, but it is still fun to play \\"what ifs\\".    The DVD has some great special features. Two commentaries, test reels, storyboards, deleted scenes, but the fake \\"ice pick\\" pen that comes with the DVD should be enough for any real fan to want to buy this film.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I liked three things about this movie; the jitterbugging pre-credit sequence (or pre-'action' - huh!), the eye makeup of the 50s and Latina singers, and a few nice shots of buildings.  For the rest... oh, go read a book!
B00005LB9O|4.0|Travis created one of the surprises of 1999-2000 with their stellar second album, &quot;The Man Who.&quot; Rather than try to duplicate the formula on their follow-up, they have changed direction a bit. It has served them well.<br />Nigel Godrich is back on board as producer, and this album adds to his legacy as well. Overall, &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; gets away from the blazing guitars that were so integral in past Travis albums. The overall feel here is sparser, more acoustic. Andy Dunlop picks up the banjo on 'Sing,' a transatlantic smash. Above all, the quality of the songs is just as solid as on &quot;The Man Who,&quot; proof that Fran Healy is a top-notch writer and not hardly a flash in the pan. Songs like 'The Cage,' 'Safe' and 'Indefinitely' are as impressive as anything he's written.<br />Travis do not try to make difficult music. What they do, as well as anyone in the world at the moment, is make great music that is accessible and honest. This album really shines on that level. There are great tunes here, and they are well-sequenced. What will they do next?
B000002LCK|4.0|Without getting too schmarmy, this collection represents most of what I love about New Order.  Personally, I feel it's worth owning if only for the first 3 tracks on disc 1 and the first 4 tracks on disc 2, which comprise all the initial singles (except \\"Truth\\") from the immediately post Joy Division days in which this band was spawned.  I love these pieces because they represent a genuine \\"new order\\"--a band trying to break away from previous definitions in sound and style, and achieving it through trial and error, with lots of legitimate experimentation.<br />Obviously, \\"Blue Monday\\"/\\"The Beach\\" are key--B.M. being the biggest selling 12\\" of all time.  But on the flipside, it's totally played out and only essential for the novice or the die-hard collector.  And then there's the period of Arthur Baker (Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force) production, which, for better or for worse, represents New Order's most popular period; although personally, my gag reflex kicks in when I hear a lot of these tracks.  A bit too much John Hughes sentimentality and Reagan-era schmarm for my liking.<br />However, at the conclusion of each disc is a single/b-side which was cut specifically for the collection (another purchase point):  \\"True Faith\\" and \\"1963\\".  Each track sort of mirrors the other in composition and sound, but I'd argue that apart from \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\" (not on this collection), these tracks stand apart as their own unique period in the N.O. legacy.  To me, they were quintessential tracks of 1987 and \\"T.F.\\" even made it into the soundtrack of Bright Lights, Big City in what I considered to be an appropriate, clubby scene.<br />Overall, a must-have for New Order/Joy Division/Electronic fans.
B000008LH5|5.0|This is classic strut and sweat rock-n-roll, the Gibson guitar  and Marshall amp at 11.... &quot;I'm Going Home &quot; is a classic , &quot;Choo Choo Mama&quot;  is THE definitve boogie song this side of Chuck Berry... the cover of of Al Kooper's &quot;I Can't Keep From Crying &quot; shows the the grossly under-rated musicianship of the band.. tight and bluesy... this is a collection must! Hey, Rock and Roll Hall of fame... are you listening?
B000002WYT|5.0|As a person who has been a long time Dave Matthews fan, I would have to rate this the top studio recorded album.  I own all of their CD's and this one tops the charts. &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; is their greatest song of all time, with a melodious tune.  &quot;Two Step&quot; has a more upbeat tune to it, easily ranking 2nd.  Although this is the best from DMB, all of their CD's can easily be rated 5 stars. Get this CD!!
630179513X|4.0|This 1990 sequel was shot back to back with Back To The Future 2. Again, it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and starred Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. In this, the third and final chapter in the series, Marty McFly(Fox)is transported, thanks to the delorean, to the year 1885. The Old West. There, he tries to save Doc Brown(Lloyd)who is to be shot and killed by a mad gunmen. Is it any surprise that the guy who is supposed to kill Doc Brown is a relation to Biff?. No, it isn't. But there are a few other problems as well. On his trip to 1885, the delorean gets a hole punctured in the fuel tank. They are trapped there. The other, is that Doc has fallen in love with a sweet school marm(played by Mary Steenburgen). Doc is conflicted between leaving and saving his life, or staying and being with the woman he truly loves, and face the chance of getting shot. The two find a way to gain enough speed to get the delorean in motion and send them back to 1985. If you haven't seen it, I won't say how. This chapter in the brilliant series is a real fun, crowd pleaser. However, it lacks a lot of the punch the first two had. The effects and everything are mild and tame in this one. Not as exciting as the previous ones. Still, it is a wonderfully made and put together film. It is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. A very satisfying end to the whole saga. Fox and Lloyd are, as always, top notch. Thomas Wilson as Biff's ancestor is, well, he's still Biff. Would we want him any other way?. Probably not. Steenburgen does the best with what she's given. It's too bad that Lea Thompson, who had such an important and prominent role in the first and second, was relegated to almost 'cameo' status in this one. Oh well. In the end, a good romp for the whole family. Watch and enjoy!!!.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Everyone thought that this one was going to be &quot;Kid A&quot; with catchier tunes. It isn't. Or it was going to be a return to the old Radiohead. Nope. However, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; contains some of the most highly anticipated Radiohead songs that appeared on their 1999 summer tour.<br />'Pyramid Song' and &quot;You and Whose Army' are brilliant tracks but hardly catchy. The only two songs off the album that sound anything like singles are 'Knives Out' and 'I Might Be Wrong.' This is not, as some have suggested, a collection of &quot;Kid A&quot; b-sides. It is an album in its own right, albeit less ambitious than &quot;Kid A.&quot; Nevertheless, half of the reason that this sounds &quot;not as weird&quot; as its predecessor is that the shock that was &quot;Kid A&quot; has finally registered.<br />Fluid and great as &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is, it is flawed. Radiohead could have done better with 'Like Spinning Plates.' Their recent live album proves that less would have been more. And one can clearly doubt the wisdom of reviving 'Morning Bell' when their were other worthy songs left off the album. But Radiohead are Radiohead, and the new version of the song works here in the middle of the album. <br />Even this slightly flawed album from Radiohead was one of the best of last year. Actually this is better than most albums from the past few years. It will be a real mindbender to try to figure out what the restless minds of Thom Yorke and company will come up with next.
0792844793|5.0|This film is a modern noir-drama by David Lynch which deals  with the evil things happening underneath the surface of a seemingly perfect world of the 50's.  It involves a college guy who discovers a dismembered ear in a field and is curious about it so he gives it to the police and begins his own investigation. What he finds out is that evil can be contagious if you're not careful and it can suck you into its destructive path. On a technical note, the film has a very rich color and often uses the color in the title. David Lynch also tampers with the sound in this and creates some haunting moments with it. <BR>As far as soundtracks go, this one takes the cake and will probably confuse some viewers as to it's immediate significance. <BR>ALSO!!! IMPORTANT!!! This is a Lynch film and it is morbid in some places that I will not go into explaining. So if you're into straightahead films, this is not it.  Some of his elements come from left field. Let me put it this way, this is a mainstream film that goes so far into left field that it almost fits the art house category. In fact, it is an art house flick. Knowing this, proceed carefully unless you are already a fan of Lynch(like I am). Very Challenging Film
B0000021RL|5.0|All of the previously written reviews provide what you need to know. This work is the last released effort which contains all the types of music which the band aspired to play and which also has appeal for the commercial audience. Especially noteworthy, and little noted, is the percussion element which involves more dimensions than drums.<br />This album was such a creative success. It's a shame the band raked in their creative efforts on future efforts when this album could have prompted them new more creative dimensions.
B00005V0X5|5.0|All right.  Finally, after 17 years, we have a copy of KIMB that is listenable.  Graet sound quality, the drums are tight, the guitars kill the ear drums, and the bass is fantastic.  Good way to enter 2002 along with the new live album.  Go Mustaine.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I can't believe that a Britney CD actually is receiving 5 stars from me!<br />This album, which I got as a birthday present (it actually got here from Amazon.com today), and I think it's absolutely incredible.<br />Britney has matured a lot from her \\"baby pop\\" on ...Baby One More Time.  She sounds like a younger version of Janet Jackson, especially on the songs \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Boys\\".<br />The best song on the album is \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\".  The most addictive ones are \\"Bombastic love\\", \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", \\"Overprotected\\", and \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\".  (ILRNR is actually a remake, which Britney seems to have a remake on every album she releases.)<br />I can totally relate to almost every song on this album, especially \\"Let me be\\", \\"Bombastic love\\", and \\"Not a girl\\".<br />There is another cool thing on this CD.  You can see clips from her movie, Crossroads (which is a really cute movie), in a special performance of \\"Overprotected\\" on the Enchanced CD portion of this CD.<br />Definitely a fun album that is well-worth the money you'd pay for it.  It's so much better than either of her previous albums and it really shows off her talent a lot better than either of those albums showed it off.<br />Definitely go get this album!  You won't be disappointed!
B00004XONN|5.0|After \\"O.K. Computer\\" most bands would have quit while they were ahead, tried to repeat the feat, or just dove into a haze of drugs and booze. Not Radiohead. The definitive band of our time has followed up the definitive album of our time with another masterpiece.<br />This is one of the least accessible records most people will ever hear. It is challenging, difficult, and rewarding. A guitar is not evident until 'How To Disappear Completely.' But despite the sonic landscape, Radiohead pull it all together. 'Everything in Its Right Place' is a wonderful opening track. 'The National Anthem' is a melange of textures and timbres. Like \\"O.K. Computer\\" the songs all function together. But unlike its predecessor, most songs here won't stand very well on their own for most people. This is, simply put, an album. And for me, the highlight of it all is the segue between 'Optimistic' and 'In Limbo.' Fantastic.<br />Most critics hammered this as experimental drivel when it came out, and then when they realized the public got it they changed their tune. This album debuted at number one on Billboard without any singles, videos, or even a real tour. Radiohead are the Beatles of our time; they can pull off everything they try. Can you think of another band that could make a number one out of this today?
B000001ESN|4.0|This is it, this is were it finally came together for the group.  They had some good cds, and some bad cds, before PERMANENT WAVES, but this started a winning streak that has yet to let up.  PERMANENT WAVES (PW) showed the group at a mature level, with songs that were ZEPPLIN rip offs, or WHO wanttabes.  PW contains only six songs, but those six songs say more than just about all of their previous cds combined.   The Spirit of Radio, and Freewill are two classics, with the first having an opening riff, that is know by most of the free world. Jacob's Ladder is haunting, it still gives me goouse bumps today.  The rest of the songs are great too.  Finally they have made tight heady rockers that don't take a whole album to do.  They are compact and to the point, and pack three times the punch of their other cds, before this time.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Is this on the same level as \\"Number of the Beast\\", \\"Powerslave\\", or \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\"? No. Does it totally blow away the awful \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" and everything else they've done since 1990?  U bet. In a musical landscape awash with boy bands, female singers who try to show off their octave ranges as much as their physical attributes, rap-rockers, nu-metal cookie monster bands, and a group of fans of 80's metal still upset at how hair bands ruined the genre and allowed grunge to come in and steamroll over everything that was sacred to them, this is a breath of fresh air. Yes, it's obvious that Maiden hasn't paved MUCH new ground, but then by virtue of what I just said, did we really want them to? At least they're back to exploring themes of science fiction and man's journey into the unknown instead of the stupid horror movie-inspired overtones that were somewhat cool when we were 15 but have somehow lost their luster at age 34. They'll probably never do another \\"Seventh Son\\", but this will do just fine. Kevin Shirley's trademark tinny-sounding production will frustrate those who like their metal a little meatier, but at the same time it serves to slightly update Maiden's sound for the new millenium. Top tracks are \\"The Wicker Man\\", \\"Blood Brothers\\", \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\", \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" and \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\"<br />Regarding the three-pronged guitar attack - on record it doesn't mean much since they always multi-tracked everything when they only had two guitars. But having seen this lineup live, the sound is definitely fuller and more true to the original recordings. The downside is having to watch Janick Gers (the \\"new guy\\" in the band, even though he's been there for 12 years) act like it's still 1986 with all his ridiculous onstage poses and shape-throwing that went out with bands like Night Ranger. In many ways, Gers reminds us that this is one of the main bands that Spinal Tap was based upon. But with a top-notch singer like Bruce Dickenson showing us how many levels of talent this band possesses live, Gers' antics are a moot point at best.
B000002MUN|5.0|One of the CD's that will never leave my CD collection. I listened to it hundreds of times, and it is in my Top 10 list.<BR>If you don't own it, buy it, if you haven't listened to it in a while, listen to it! A must, must, must.  Classic rockin' Petty sound, especially on the Honeybee track, and the rest of the CD is incredible, start to finish.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I loved the man who.. absolutely loved it. Could not turn it off, still can't.  This album doesn't have the same hook as the man who, it's not as melodic, cohesive or singable but it has alot of other things going for it.  It's a moodier &quot;darker darks&quot;, &quot;lighter lights&quot; kind of album than the man who.  It's more organic, not as much guitare work as in &quot;man who&quot; and &quot;good feeling&quot;.  This album is more of a mishmash of songs that don't sound like they were necessairily written together.  The music in't written in the typical way in that you don't have those &quot;yeah, that sounds awesome&quot; solos or anything like that.  But each song has a definite personality or colour that really sets a mood well.  Some of the standouts for me are:<br />sing: has a banjo solo ever sounded so good?<BR>pipe dreams:  amazing bass line and flow<BR>flowers in the window: beatlesesque folk song.. great<BR>indefinitely: love the lyrics<BR>&quot;time exists just on your wrist so don't panic, moments last but lifetimes are lost in a day.. so wind your watches down please&quot;<br />anyways, if you like the way travis can set the mood, get this album.. also if you get a chance to see them live do it.. i saw them and remy zero a couple of weeks after september 11th and they made me feel so much better.. one of my most memorable concerts ever..
B00005NWM3|4.0|Honestly I had not heard anything by this group other than &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; which is played constantly on the radio.  I loved the song!  I have heard the groups name mentioned numerous times and have noticed that they get a lot of publicity.  I knew their new album was having success so I was curious to hear it for myself and see what this band was all about and what all the talk was about.  Obviously going into this I had no expectations and no previous knowledge of any of their past works.  I took a chance and bought the album and put it in.  The fist song &quot;Never Again&quot; comes out rocking and I fell in love with it instantly!!  I think it is my favorite song on the whole cd.  I thought to myself that if the rest of the cd is like this than it is going to really rock.  It took me awhile to stop listening to the first two songs and hear the rest of the album, but once I did I found that I really liked it!  Not every song is the best or most catchy, but overall it is a very good album.  I guess if you are tired of grunge rock then you won't be satisfied with this album and will be like many others and criticize it.  If you don't like grunge/alternative music then don't buy it.  If you do though, it is a very easy listen and many songs will grab a hold of you and you'll find yourself singing the hooks in your head even when you aren't listening to it. I get tired of people criticizing an album because it isn't what they want to listen to.  If you don't want to listen to it, then don't!!  Don't criticize a band just because you don't like the type of music they play or if you think the style/type is outdated.  If you think that, then don't listen to the group.  At least objectively critique the group for what they have put out.  In my opinion a very good grunge/alternative album that is worth the money spent on it and more.   I am not going to say that every song will be your cup of tea, but overall the album entertains and keeps you singing alongwhich in my opinion is exactly the reason to buy any cd!!
B000050IE6|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic. 5 songs  - clock in more than 60 min. But every song can be split into - 2 or three songs.<BR>The core of the music is some sort of death metal, but they mix in tonn of acoustic and other styles that it's just very intersting to listen to. Mikael can both grunt and sing clearly very well. When they play acoustic parts, it's not like just one guitar playing - it's two acoustics or one acoustic and one electric creating some very nice picture. Over all sound is awesome - you can hear all instruments well and separatelly, but still playing the same song together. <BR>Atmosphere of the album and lyrics are some sort of sad, melancholic and romantic. All songs are great, don't get boring and really beautiful. Buy this album and listen to it carefully - you will need to pay attention and you'll love it. Buy it! Highly recommended!!!
B00005YTFG|5.0|Musical lovers rejoice! This movie is incredible. Baz Luhrman did a fantastic job with stunning visuals and incredible songs! The actors (Ewan Mcgregor and Nicole Kidman) really pull this one off. While it could have come off hokey, it is actually brilliant. A tragic love story that will pull at your heart. The songs, dialogue, and visuals will astound you! A real work of art! Five stars, two thumbs up!
0060392886|5.0|As far back as I can rememember, there was Motley Crue.  I was a mere 10 years old when they released their first album.  Having always been one of my favorite bands, I felt this deep down urge to KNOW the band.  And that is exactly what The Dirt gave me.  A knowledge that I had never had before, one that I felt I needed.  I read this book in less than 48 hours and enjoyed every word of text and and every photo the book had to offer.  I reccomend this book to anyone who ever heard of Motley Crue, whether you loved them or hated them. This book has true insight into the fast and furious world of the 80's metal rock star.  They should make a movie.
6304341849|4.0|This is certainly one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, from an aesthetic point of view. I felt swept up by the scenery, the music, the costumes. But, aside from the surface beauty, there beats underneath the heart of a true classic. This is one of Merchant/Ivory's most under-rated films. It is the adaptation of the E.M. Forster novel, 'Maurice', which itself remained un-published until after his death. The film is completely faithful to the book, so faithful, in fact, that it stretches to two and a half hours what could have been told in under two hours. But, no matter. It never ceases to amaze me how the British can produce films of such breath-taking detail and clarity, and spend only a fraction of the budget that their American counterparts do.<br />James Wilby stars as Maurice Hall, who falls in love with his classmate, Clive Durham, portrayed by Hugh Grant. They are both undergraduates at Cambridge. The time is the Edwardian era, and they must keep their feelings under wraps. Clive is much more reserved than Maurice, in the long run. Eventually Clive gives in to the pressures from his mother (an icily perfect Judy Parfitt) and marries the pretty but uninteresting Anne (Phoebe Nichols). Maurice and Clive never consummated their relationship, and from the looks of things, there isn't much of a sexual relationship between Clive and his wife.<br />Maurice finds his solace and his savior in Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper on Clive's estate, played with ferociously understated sensuality by Rupert Graves. Indeed, the second half of this film belongs to Rupert Graves. He is young, baby-faced, but with a deep voice and a confident swagger, and the simmering sexuality about ready to explode. You can see his feelings in his eyes. It would be impossible for Maurice to turn him down. This is where the film received some criticism; since Maurice and Alec are from different classes, backgrounds and education, surely their relationship would wither and fade once the passion had ended? E.M. Forster received the same criticism when he shared his manuscript with a few select friends. But, part of the reason the book succeeds is because of the belief and fervent hope that the relationship between Maurice and Alec will work. It must work, against all the odds of society.<br />The portrayal of the period's homophobia is exquisite. There is a heartbreaking scene where Maurice tries to confide in the family doctor, portrayed by Denholm Elliott. Dr. Barrie merely reacts to Maurice in disgust. Maurice turns to a quack hypnotist, played by Ben Kingsley, but finds he cannot deny his true nature.<br />Since Hugh Grant has become mega famous in the 10 plus years since the film was made, it is often referred to as a \\"Hugh Grant film.\\" Grant is extremely reserved in the role, showing no signs of his future as a comic actor. I would have preferred him to portray Maurice Hall, however. James Wilby is sweet and believeable, but he lacks something in the role. Although he does balance well with the erotic Rupert Graves, as Maurice seems as confused and searching as he is intended to be.<br />A breath-taking, entertaining and extremely intelligent film; I highly recommend it.passion had ended?

6300218031|4.0|&quot;Some Kind Of Wonderful&quot;? The title makes it sound like a light Maeve Binchy novel. The first time I saw this movie on TV I couldn't get over the incredible acting mostly because of the name, because a title means alot in a film. I definetely wasn't expecting this.
6302000823|5.0|I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo, the small Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and the older man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It is a deceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. You never want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreaking simplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable.
B000001ZS4|5.0|What to say... it's already been said!  Just buy it now, the proof is in the listening.  I find part 8 to be the most amazing... haunting and majestic, and it inspired a story-poem once, about a purple mist after a storm on Jupiter, and a strange creature grinding an organ.<br />Superb!  This and &quot;Oxygene&quot; are the musical realizations of a lifetime... also check out &quot;Magnetic Fields&quot; (if you can find it), Rendez-vous, and Ethnicolor.
B00005QW5X|4.0|It's not that I disliked \\"Moulin Rouge\\", which is nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards....but....\\"Hedwig\\" is a far superior movie, and more effective in relaying it's story through the use of music.  Do not be turned off by the transsexual/gay storyline, because everyone I know who has seen this has just LOVED it!  Hedwig rules!
B00003CXXP|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I love nearly every movie made by Spielberg and Kubrick.  However, you cannot combine the style of each and get a good movie.<br />Spielberg is all about making an emotional movie that you feel attached to (ET, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, etc.) and Kubrick is all about making you question your basic concepts and beliefs.  He doesn't want you to like the characters (Clock Work Orange, Full Metal Jacket, etc.)  The two styles DO NOT mix.  You cannot have a cute cuddly character (Haley Joel Osment) and have him tormented and tortured throughout the movie and have the movie going public like it.<br />Spielberg tried to make ET 2.  Cute cuddly creature that someone falls in love with, have them torn apart by forces beyond their control, and then have an emotional reunion at the end to make everybody feel better.<br />All that, and the movie wouldn't end.  The worst part was when the \\"Aliens\\" came.  Jeez, couldn't they come up with a better ending than that?
B00005O3VC|1.0|This is an excellent movie, but the DVD edition is awful.  There are numerous defects in the DVD.  The worst problem is that subtitles appear even when they are turned off. I know that there are supposed to be subtitles during the credits as a joke--but I'm talking about ALL THROUGH THE FILM!! The company that released this movie is doing nothing to correct this problem--so steer clear.  I returned my copy and bought the older edition of the DVD on Ebay--It is a great movie when subtitles aren't popping up every few seconds! (this problem doesn't occur on all DVD players-but it does show up on most including almost all SONY players).
B00005UEAR|4.0|Having just been pleasantly surprised by Symphony X's V, I thought I'd pop in to see what kind of raves were being pumped about Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  Much to my surprise, I found grousing instead.  The first time ran through this (double) disc, I was impressed all to hell.  There was only one track that stuck out as not worthy of the company of the others (\\"Solitary Shell\\"), and at least three that warranted replays (\\"The Glass Prison\\", \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\").<br />So, I figured I'd listen to the whole album again, and review it as it goes.  I should mention, I could care less about the lyrics and have nothing to say about them.  With prog rock, for me, it's almost always about the instrumentation, the human voice being just another instrument.<br />The Glass Prison, at almost 14 minutes, is the longest individual song on the album.  It opens with a very thick, crunchy guitar mess and develops very nicely to a variant of this heavy guitar line around minute 6 or so that is very satisfying; the vocalist alternates between howling and sung vocals over the top over the comparatively slow-paced guitar line.  It gets right into the bones.  Other reviewers have complained about speed for speed's sake - up to 9'45\\" there has been no gratuitous shredding at all;  at 9'45\\" the band cuts loose for awhile (about 90 seconds), and then a variant of the heavy guitar line comes back, heavily treated, very flanged, and not at all gratuitous to my ears (in all the bridge is about 3 minutes).  The whole thing wraps up with semi-epic sounding prog-metal vocals and an abrupt ending, yes.  Those who complain about the ending, what's up?  Obviously, the band is smart enough to know how to write a song;  why not give them credit for making the decision for a sudden ending?  After almost 14 minutes of music, the ending is surprising, and drives the whole thing home more for me.  In any case, the whole song is very intelligently put together, and the reviewers who are complaining about lack of songs...what are they talking about?<br />Blind Faith (10'21\\") begins with what seems like a deliberate contrast to The Glass Prison with a rather conventional sounding rock arrangement, very song-like.  This segues nicely into a chorus lick with wailing vocals and another heavy, slowish guitar line, none of the warp-speed shredding others are complaining about, then a groovy wah-wah pedaled riff that I'd like to hear more of.  The song then repeats this, substituting a bridge for the wah-wah pedal riff.  So far, this is standard verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge songwriting, so where the lack of song is here, I just don't get it.  The bridge begins with a rather jazzy (and yes many-noted) solo, but then moves through a mid-tempo, developed series of themes and riffs by the whole band, led principally by the guitar.  Nowhere in here do I find shredding for shredding's sake.  Notes abound throughout here, but it hardly seems that they're gratuitous; they all blend right in with the music like they belong there.  After two and a half minutes of bridge, the vocals return....verse-chorus form again, with a moody, quasi-atmospheric coda to round it out.  So, even though it clocks in at 10 minutes, Blind Faith is entirely in standard song format.  The whole thing hangs together very nicely.<br />It's worth noting that neither of these songs feels as long as they are.  They don't drag, and they don't feel like 10+ minute songs.  You know what they say, time flies....<br />Misunderstood (9'22\\") is, far and away, my favorite song on the album.  It starts with a little acoustic guitar thing, the vocals follow, and then (oh joyous thing) the main lick is introduced, a super-low, slow, heavy, cello-like, snaky bassline, topped by a Frippian-sounding, slow guitar noodle barely discernible in the background of the mix.  The acoustic opening then returns, and a variation on the vocals comes in, with soundscape-like guitars.  The main chorus riff then bursts in again, the vocalist sounding very good through here.  But then, see, the bridge comes in -- fans of recent Fripp and King Crimson will immediately note the influence.  The main guitar riff here is huge, crunchy and compelling with a freaky, treble-chord solo on it....way too cool; it reminds me of the riff in KC's \\"Level 5\\" if you've ever heard that, and the solo could well be virtually an homage to Fripp.  The chorus then returns, as if just to remind you of how neat it is, and then the band returns to the Fripp bit again -- this bridge alone would be enough to convince me to buy the album.  (Have I mentioned thrashing and shredding yet in this song?  No, because there hasn't been any.)  The Fripp bridge the second time through thumps along, with chorus-like guitars swirling over the top and the keyboards getting off on an edgy, \\"experimental\\" (as one reviewer put it) solo, the whole thing dissolving into chaos and fading out.  It's like the whole song breaks down, the guitar reduced to string-scratching wails while the Fripp lick creeps back in on bass....and then breaks off.  This is not a conventionally assembled song, but the parts all work together.  Even with it being 9 minutes long, I usually listen to it at least twice.<br />Disappear (6'46\\") counterbalances the heaviness of the last song (reminding me of how King Crimson used to do so in the old days) with a mellow, semi-movie-soundtrack sounding opening.  The melody of the chorus is particularly nice here, even with the treated vocals.  Again, the song form is verse-chorus, and at the end of the second time around, a new theme is introduced with full-bodied prog-metal orchestration (at slow-dance tempo, still no tasteless shredding).  The song ends on a reprise of the opening lick.  Totally conventional song form here, and no hint of Liquid Tension Experiment.  The utterly fuzzed out guitar here, and the soulfulness of the vocals definitely recommend this song.  I'm just not getting how someone could call the vocals trite or misplaced or awkward.<br />Thus ends CD 1.  In my book, not an objectionable moment in the whole nearly 47 minutes.<br />CD 2 is a suite of songs, opening with an Overture (6'49\\").  One reviewer remarks testily that the \\"theme\\" makes him want to puke;  I'm not sure which theme he is talking about, since an overture necessarily contains many themes from the music to come.  By their nature, of course, overtures tend not to be the most amazing things, since they are a hodgepodge of pieces to come.  I'm impressed with the orchestralness of the thing...the last time I heard a band sound this symphonic was probably Kansas way back in the \\"Song for America\\" days.  (No tasteless shredding here either.)<br />About to Crash (5'51\\") starts off as a straightforward rock piece, with more verse-chorus song structure.  The vocals seem to figure more prominently here than on the first disk;  the guitar has fallen back to a more accompanying role (increasing the sense of typical songfulness here).  Around 3'45\\", a bridge-vocal introduces a new theme, a not-too-heavy crunchy thing with fine vocals on top that segues into a very nice, glass-steel sounding solo (Gilmour-paced practically, not self-indulgently showy at all);  the tempo then slows down even more, with a soulful, slightly predictable solo that reprises a section of the Overture by way of an introduction to the next song.<br />War Inside My Head (2'08\\") is the shortest song on the album, and features a nice, bone-jarring (but hardly warp-speed) opening theme;  it reminds me of Testament for some reason.  This is a \\"standard\\" sounding prog-metal song, but very ably accomplished--keyboards providing counterpoint on top, vocals howling.  The main complaint is that it is short, and the way it cuts into the next track.  Hearing it stand-alone, you'd be sure that the rest of the track was missing.<br />The Test That Stumped Them All (5'03\\"):  Finally, 60 minutes into the album we get some tasteless shredding....and about time, considering how often reviewers complained about it &lt;lol>.  It lasts about 20 seconds, though, and then the keyboard and guitar become overlaid, and it's pretty cool sounding.  This shortly settles into a heavy, fastish crunching thing with vocals, that sounds very Testament or maybe \\"Masters of Puppets\\" Metallica.  Resemblances are dispelled by the chorus though, which has an interesting vocal and guitar counterpoint, if very short.  Verse-chorus structure again carries us to the bridge of the song, which kicks in just just too deliciously--actually a solo (yes, with lots of notes) over the top of the main theme transposed up, the whole timbre of the song changing, becoming cleaner, like emerging from clouds or some such;  a reprise of the opening shred, plus the heavy guitar lick takes us to another fast solo, a briefly introduced (not fast) guitar lick that is developed shortly with keyboards over the top, a little bit of stunt guitar to end the piece, a fade out and finally a full stop (the first on the side).  In point of facing how someone could call the vocals trite or misplaced or awkward.<br />Thus ends CD 1.

B00005B36H|3.0|A fan of tool for a long time, I was both pleased and dissapointed by their latest effort. Pleased becuase it's well, Tool. I've heard people say in thier reviews that Lateralus &quot;isn't AEnima&quot;. Well, I don't think it was intended to be. I think with each Tool album, the group members want to evolve and do something different with each CD they put out; compare Opiate and AEnima to see what I mean. Although powerful, this CD failed to move me as did the other three had. One thing about it that irked me was airplay. Never has one Tool song been so overplayed than &quot;Schism&quot;. Truth be told, I stopped listning to the CD itself after hearing &quot;Schism&quot; played over the radio countless times. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of standout songs, trite as it may sound. On each of the other Tool CD's, I found myself listning to one or two tracks; but with Lateralus, it just wasn't happening. This took away from the overall enjoyment of the disk; I just could not enjoy it as much as I could have, hence the three star rating. But that's my opinion, I could be wrong.
B00005K3OT|5.0|A charming satire done in the Gallic vein with an outstanding cast. The film is a sheer delight from beginning to end! How wonderful to find a good movie that can be watched by the entire family. I was able to watch this with my 87-year-old mother and not continually wince at the language and be embarrassed. The performances are excellent and the plot is intriguing. There is a commercial that states &quot;Ah, the power of cheese!&quot; Chocolate seems to have that same power in this film. Or rather, chocolat to use the French. &quot;Try it; you'll like it.&quot;
B00005A46T|4.0|I like this CD. I know there are people out there saying that Slipknot doesn't need nine members, or that they are talentless. I guess everyone's a critic. I have my beefs with this CD. One is about the lyrics. Corey sounds as if he pulled some scary, big words out of a dictionary to make him sound intelligent. Core, spare us the intellegent factor and just go back to what you do best: scream about how you hate everything. (not that I doubt that Corey isn't a smart guy, I'm sure he is. But using big words in place of something that requires, well, not big words, isn't needed). Anyway, besides that, this is a solid release by one of today's premier metal bands.
B000021Y74|4.0|I liked the movie.  It has a nice story which is a hearing girl is born to death parents and is a story of her life.<br />My sister-in-law, who signs, had a hard time following the subtitles and the signing.  She can't watch two things at once.  This is trivia but my sister-in-law says the German signing is slightly different than American, makes sense.
B000000H4V|5.0|This is by far the most convincing heavy metal album I have heard since ...well, Paranoid. Few albums have ever striked  me with such intensity and power as this. Even though this album works perfectly as a whole, I'm going to alternate my reviewing methods and go for a song-by-song review. Here we go:<br />\\"Refuse/Resist\\" opens the album with what might be the best album opening I've heard; first we hear the heartbeats of yet-to-be-born (?) son of Max Cavalera. Then comes some ethnic-style percussion work with create a kind of tension that simply blows you away before the crushing guitars kick in. The song itself is as merciless as ever. Probably the best track of the album, and that sais a lot!<br />\\"Territory\\" is the \\"hit\\" song here, which is by not means a bad thing, after all, it is Sepultura we're talking about! The third verse echo-entrance vocals are later introduced on their great cover of Sabbath's \\"symptom of the universe\\".<br />\\"Slave new World\\" is another song reminding me about the Sabbath cover, only here it's the drums and guitar which create same kind of sound. Igor Cavalera is probably the most impressive member on this album, and Slave new World is another exemple why.<br />\\"Amen\\" ís angry, intelligent, merciless and yearning for justice. Just like the whole thing, basically.<br />\\"Kaiowas\\" is a relaxing acoustic part which fits perfectly in the combination. It is actually possible that without this kind of a calmer part the album could have been a lot less enjoyable. Even though the song itslef is calm and relaxing, the topic here ain't half an inch lighter. You don't make teen pop that is dedicated to a native tribe that committed a mass suicide to protest against the government's unjustified actions on their land.<br />\\"Propaganda\\"; the name sais it all. the song is probalby the fastest so far on this album, and kicks the rage back on.<br />\\"Biotech Is Godzilla\\". If \\"Propaganda\\" was a faster one, wait 'til you hear this one! This might appealto many hardcore fans, which also can be explained with the fact that the legendary ex- Dead Kennedys frontman and freedom of speech fighter Jello biafra has done the lyrics. Seems like Jello has still got plenty to say to us!<br />\\"Nomad\\" is again one heck of a good song. One piece in the puzzle that makes this record so damn enjoyable.<br />\\"We Who Are Not As Others\\" is an effective and almost hypnotic repetition of the title. Could be seen as a sort of an anthemic  tribute for those of us who aren't afraid to be different.<br />\\"Manifest\\" tells anothe sad tale about what can happen when the police forces are given way too much power. once again, sad but true. <br />\\"The Hunt\\" is a New Model Army cover which brings more melodic sense to the album, although the band makes sure it's instantly recognizable as a Sepultura track.<br />\\"Clenched Fist\\" conclude the album with enough aggression and rage to tear down anothe Berlin Wall. <br />All in all, this album is a must if your recorshelf needs a mindblowing hardcore/metal experience. Magnetosphere-highly recommended.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I'd have to say that of all the RHCP CD's this, one's the best.  The one thing I do miss on it, though, is the FUNK!  It has virtually none.  However, I can over look this because of the other great kinds of music this album explores, such as the more hard-rock thing, which was non-existant in their other great album, BSSM.  I think I'll review all of the songs just cuz I can!<br />All around the world-B+--Good song, fun to listen too, but it looses it's luster over time.<BR>Parrallell Universe-B--Not bad, but a completely new genre for the peppers.  You can tell they haven't polished it yet.<BR>Scar Tissue-A--A mighty fine song.  Not as whiney as Otherside, which I like.  Still, not the best.<BR>Otherside-A--I just had to give this track an A.  It really has feeling and an interesting message.  CAN get old, though.<BR>Get on top-C+--a bit out of place on this album, lyrically.  Would've fit better on BSSM in that sense.<BR>Californication-A+--Never get tired of this track.  Even though it's focused on LA, I link the messages to a lot of things.<BR>Easily-B+--Possibley containing some of the best lyrics on the whole thing, but the beat is a bit repetitive.<BR>Porcelain-A--Nice break.  Haunting, if u ask me.<BR>Emmit Remmus-C--Definately the weakest track.<BR>I like dirt-C+--Entertaining for a while.  I'm glad they concealed the sex a bit more on this than BSSM.<BR>This velvet glove-A+--GREAT song.  Shows how the peppers have progressed with their haroin addictions.<BR>Savior-B--The quiter part is great.  However, the rest is musically lacking.<BR>Purple stain-B+--I personally like this track.  One of the more sex-related tracks on the CD.<BR>Right on time-B+-- ... confusing.  I really am not sure what it's about.  Nice tune.<BR>Road trippin-A--Not a great subject, but good lyrics and a mighty fine tune.  <br />This was the first RHCP album I got and it remains the best in my mind.
B00000612P|5.0|Rock critics usually go head-over-heels in their love for<BR>this album, which found Rod Stewart defining a moment for<BR>himself which would last through his entire career.  Hit after<BR>hit followed, but he remained best known for \\"Maggie May\\", <BR>the tale of his first sexual experience which was laid down with<BR>surprising emotional sincerity--artistically speaking, it <BR>demolishes later commercial tripe like \\"Hot Legs\\" and \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" and weathers dozens of repeat listenings.<br />And yet, \\"Maggie May\\" is not even the greatest song on the album.<BR>The title track is a rock'n'roll masterpiece, an out-of-breath<BR>stomp through white-boy soul territory that never fails to get<BR>the blood pumping.  \\"Mandolin Wind\\" is one of the finest<BR>ballads in rock history and reason enough to buy the disc (or<BR>any greatest hits which has it)--every time the acoustic guitar<BR>quietly starts anew for each verse, each moment becomes more precious and tear-filled.  Then there's the covers: a picture-<BR>perfect take on \\"That's Alright\\", an epic hard-rock journey <BR>through \\"I'm Losing You\\" and an emotive \\"Reason To Believe\\" all<BR>sound apiece with the originals both musically and thematically.<BR>If you only buy one Stewart album for your collection, this is<BR>the one to get, although if you like it you'll no doubt want<BR>to own \\"Gasoline Alley\\", \\"Never A Dull Moment\\" and \\"Best Of The<BR>Faces\\" as well.  As long as you ignore anything recorded after<BR>1976, you may well be convinced that Rod The Mod was one of the<BR>best singer-songwriters rock ever produced.
B000002LQR|5.0|A true accomplishment and the best CD of the 90's.... In the world of words, the Chili peppers have got most all bands beat.  Even when they're singing about [nothing], they make it convincing [nothing].  That's probabley my favorite element about them.  <br />Another thing I like about them is their diversity.  They go from songs like \\"Give it away\\", a track I still cant put in a specific genre, to \\"Under the bridge\\", the type of song that saves the album from falling into the non-depressing and soulful pit of doom.  <br />Despite tracks like \\"Under the bridge\\" and \\"I could have lied\\", I think that the Chili peppers had not quite relized their talent at slower and more thoughtful songs at the time of this album.... For that reason and one other reason I just can't say that this album is the best it could POSSIBLEY be.  The other reason is that nasty track, \\"Sir phyco sexy\\".  Taken staight from the dreams of... anthony, that one was!  The only lyrically lacking song on the whole thing.  O well!  <br />Anyway, this CD, for those of us who find that grunge gets old and rap is just [not good], is simply the best...
B00000612Q|5.0|What can one say about this amazing work?  This and &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot; undeniably caught Stewart at the peak<BR>of his game, a peak which would slowly erode over the next<BR>three or four albums and never again be recaptured.  But when<BR>he was hot, he was hot.  Every track here is a winner, and<BR>there are many classics--personal favorites include the winning<BR>opener &quot;True Blue&quot;, the perfect &quot;Italian Girls&quot; (which blends<BR>his hard-rock and mandolin-folk styles inside a hilarious<BR>lyric), the endearing hit &quot;You Wear It Well&quot; and the larynx-tearing &quot;I'd Rather Go Blind&quot;.  Although musically it is almost identical to &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot;, this is certainly not a bad thing and the songwriting is every bit its equal.  The only less than classic performance here is the<BR>lightweight &quot;Twistin' The Night Away&quot;, but other fans seem to <BR>like it.  In short, it is very hard to choose between this and<BR>&quot;Every Picture&quot; as his very best album; taken along with <BR>&quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, these represent three of the greatest <BR>consecutive album releases of the 70s.

B00005Q3TZ|3.0|I'm giving this movie a 3 because overall it's a great movie, But it's hard to keep with the story line. The Romance is highly efecient, but there should have been more action. Also, casting was great.
B00005N9CV|2.0|This is the latest offering from a very tellented singer/pianist.<br />The voice is very good, but the orchestra is an unnecessary addition.  <br />the orchestra plays everything very slowly, they perform appaulingly.  If they played like this at a classical concert,it would cause a mass walk out.<br />The accompanying marketing photographs are tacky,sexist and unnecessary.<br />Don't buy it, instead buy her LOVE SCENES or anything by Carmen McRae.
0671891634|5.0|After reading this book (as it should to most) investing just seems to make more sense. Mr. Lynch has worked magic at Fidelity and his genius has effected many investors. This book isn't just full of good info, it's full of info that nobody but Mr. Lynch could have written.
078401213X|5.0|Take a journey through a mind on overload. This movie exploits the famed history of the number PI with snips of actual mathematical revelations divulged throughout the plot. However, the intrigue is the main character who reveals to us, the potential power of discovering the numerical constant's in life and it's impact on his emotional well being. There is a sickness, or is it a madness that has developed, but the audience is not sure what it is, or which came first, was it due to his quest, or did it provoke the quest? I would have had an alternate ending, but that is merely because I do not subscribe to the mainstream idea that higher knowledge is forbidden. I realize for most, the end is satisfactory. I like the high contrast black and white cinematography and the lightning speed flashes of scenery. This movie visually appeals to the alternative, gritty side. If you like the number PI, math in general, see the grids in nature, or just want to take a trip in a guy's head.....I recommend this movie.
B000003S2K|5.0|I was having a Terrible Time last week, and a friend gave me this album. I politely thanked him, but was thinking, \\"this is so weird, I'm sure I'll never listen to it.\\"<br />I have never been so instantly moved by anything before. After about two minutes I looked at him with my mouth open and said, \\"I love this music.\\"  It has not been off my turntable since. (it was an LP!!)  I listen to it when I wake up in the morning and it gives the most gentle start to my day.  I'm convinced that it's doing something very therapeutic for my brain. It's definitely good for the soul.  Incredibly soothing, comforting. It's just wraps around your brain and says, \\"Easy now, easy easy easy.\\"
0783226063|1.0|Big-budget sci-fi epic about the rise of a messiah on a desert planet is the exact opposite of its miniseries remake: Dull, cheesy, badly acted (with the exceptions of Patrick Stewart and Sting), and simply unpleasant to look at.  It's also an incomprehensible mess with a lot of insulting interior monologue (\\"Arrakis...Dune...desert planet\\" is a phrase repeated no less than three times in the first ten minutes, as if though we couldn't get it the first time!). Certainly, this will hold much appeal to hardcore David Lynch fans but everybody else will probably be smarter and stay away. Special note to the final battle scene, which features not a single loss on the Fremen side!

B000006OS2|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies, hey, it's a John Wayne flick.  Lots of fun, action, and the standard brawl scene.  Unfortunately, the video quality is the worst I've seen on a DVD... muddy color, blurry, grainy.  I'm not sure if the film was shot widescreen or not, but this DVD is not widescreen.  If a new edition came out with the problems corrected, I'd rebuy it.  The lack of technical quality gets in the way of the enjoyment of the movie.  Were it not for the video quality problems, I'd give it 5 stars.
6305897786|2.0|Roman Polanski is a great director and the cast here is great (except for Mrs. Polanski, who could make wood look like Olivier), but I sat through this one and was disappointed.<br />I was all set for a great supernatural detective thriller, with Polanski at the helm no less - what I got instead was a slow build of suspense, building... building... to no payoff.  The plot turns on Balkan's (Frank Langella) hiring of Corso (Johnny Depp) to find and buy for him two rare books - but Balkan's jumping on a plane and stealing them himself!  Why did he hire Corso in the first place?  So Depp could have several witty exchanges with Langella on the phone, each time asking him \\"Where are you?\\" without answer?  Not enough to hang a plot on, guys.<br />...Even if the ending is supposed to leave you to your own interpretation, as many reviewers have suggested, it's still a huge letdown and wrecks the movie. <br />I'm still shaking my head at this one.  Want a scary Polanski movie?  Try \\"Rosemary's Baby\\".

I wish I would have heard of the book earlier. \\"The Giver\\" is an interesting book on life in the future.  I liked it due to that I couldn't put the book down.  There was that sense of \\"oh what is going to happen?\\" type deal.  Got to love suspence.  It kept me awake, which is hard to do, and left me on the edge of my seat.

I'd heard good things about them and some of my friends were into 'em... After it was over, I was speechless...and still am to this day! What can you say about one of the greatest metal accomplishments of all time?<br />Also, when you buy the album these days it is expanded with Aggressive Perfector (insane version) and Criminally Insane (remix). WOW!! Talk about value!

I really didn't enjoy this movie very much; they left off most of the better mutants (think Gambit and Beast) and the ones that were present weren't the same as in the cartoon.  Trust me, pass this one up (unless you aren't familiar with the cartoon--my husband never saw it, and he enjoyed this movie).

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think that the marketing done to this film was wrong.  It did not convey what the film actually is.  At first I was not interested in seeing the film, but somehow, one day I went to see it because some people had told me they had liked it.<br />I fell in love with the film.  I believe that it is an extraordinary piece of film making in every regard:  music; actors; director; editing; photography; make-up; dresses ...<br />I could not make my wife see it in theaters as she did not like the idea of seeing such a movie.  I, of course, bought the DVD and showed it to her.  She did not like it !!!  I could not believ it because I thought that she would actually like it.  In her opinion, the music is good but the imaginery, the takes, the photography is too harsh, quick, overwhelming.  Actually that is true, but that was one of the things I liked about it.<br />It is certainly not a Marylin Monroe style of musical.  It actually has a beatifull love story in it.  The acting is superb.  Just to think that these actors are actually singing by themselves such beatiful potpourry fo music is amazing, but at the same time they act incredibly well and they are able to convey their caracters and emotions wonderfully.<br />I use to think that Musicals were done for people that had no idea about acting.  Well, this one is not like that.  And would give the Oscar to Nicole Kidman; to Baz Luhrmann; and the film itself.<br />I highly recomend this film.  I have still to see Brilliant Minds, but up to now this is the film of 2001.
B0000584V3|5.0|First of all I just want to say the only reason I prefer Opeth's \\"Still Life\\" is purely due to personal thinking, it is not musically superior to \\"Blackwater Park\\", in fact, I don't think anything can touch it!<BR>With every album Opeth have demonstrated their formidable talent, uniqueness and confindence in not being afraid to hold anything back, but equally importantly they have shown increasing maturity as they have progressed through the years, and \\"Blackwater Park\\" is definately their most mature work to date, a stunning masterpiece packed with melodies, guitar solos, death metal and many calm passages, theres even a fully acoustic song here: \\"Harvest\\", brilliant and very professional. <BR>On first listen of \\"Blackwater Park\\" songs that caught me especially were \\"Bleak\\" and \\"Blackwater Park\\", the title song. Both very lengthy and dark, the latter exceeding 12 minutes, and every second is worth it. \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\" is a very short song no more than 2 minutes long with just a guitar and piano, I must admit I think this a beautiful piece of music, as I'm sure many people will agree, perfectly suited to preceed the epic closer.<BR>Other really bulky songs on this album are the great opener \\"The Leper Affinity\\" and \\"The Drapery Falls\\", again both demonstrating brilliant musicianship and confidence, I'm guessing conifidence is not an issue for a band like Opeth.<BR>People have told me in the past their favourite song on this album is \\"The Funeral Portrait\\", this song does indeed possess one of the albums best riffs, but personally I prefer \\"Dirge for November\\", it is slightly shorter than your average Opeth song, and has rather a different structure aswell, with a long deathy bridge in the middle, preceeded and succeeded by acoustic parts, the later acoustic part being my favourite passage in the whole album, simply outstanding and almost \\"Katatonic\\" that is, sounding slightly like Katatonia, but lets leave the comparisons to Katatonia aside, I prefer Opeth!<BR>Every album by Opeth possesses it's own element that is above all the other albums, with \\"Blackwater Park\\" I would say it demonstrates another step forward for Opeth with regards to maturity, and song writing brillance, without tailing off into looking for an excuse to show off, a fault I feel Dream Theater have demonstrated.<BR>My favourite songs: \\"Bleak\\" \\"Blackwater Park\\". <BR>I'd strongly recommend \\"Blackwater Park\\" to anyone looking for something different to listen to in terms of heavy music, in fact I'd probably bore them to death by going on about it too much!
B00003CXXP|2.0|For those of you that remember the movie Daryl, with a somewhat similar theme, I can say that Daryl was much better.  For being a 1989 movie, it is noit listed in amazon, but you can find it it in IMDb.<br />I had the opportunity to see AI in an airplane going from Sao Paulo to Caracas. It is not the best place to see a movie, and it was probably an edited version for airlines. However, I believe it was more than enough.<br />I usually love any kind of film, and it is very rare that I do not like one. I do love films made by Stanley Kubrick, specially 2001 Space Odyssey; Barry Lindon; and Eyes Wide Shut. I also love films made by Steven Spielberg, specially ET.<br />However, Artificial Intelligence is neither a Stanley Kubrick film nor a Spielberg film. It actually is a very bad mixture.<br />For me, the main problem is the actual story. Photography and Acting was good. But the story was filled with unnecessary episodes. The story does not need a complicated gigolo robot, or extraterrestrial beings, or the people's movement against \\"mecha\\". They are all irrelevant aspects to the main story, but use up must of the film time. No value added there ...<br />The film is actually totally depressing and very un-Spielberg at that. But the film is also very un-Kubrick as caracters and situations are not developed at all, and the story actually ends, there is nothing left to the imagination as Kubrick usually did. Neither is the film \\"science fiction\\" as nothing of the fiction of science is explained<br />I believe that movie fans should see this particular movie as a historic piece of film making in the life of two great directors. The film is not in itself good or remarkable. I am not sure that Stanley Kubrick did a favor to Spielberg ...
0786867973|5.0|First of all, do yourself a favor and try to catch at least one show of Nigella Bites before buying this book. Just like fingerprints, every cook's dishes look and taste different and her show will give you a feel for her cooking &quot;personality&quot;, style and techniques If you relate to that ( I do), read on...<br />  Next, keep in mind that Lawson creates dishes for those who are willing to expand their cooking repertoires, to be a bit experimental and even daring. If you don't like to use spices or have kids who hate them, you might want to avoid this book. But if you like a bit of snap and zing to your meals and think of cooking as akin to creating visual delights and new feasts for the palate, this book may be just what you need to broaden your horizons. I love the show; I love this book!
B00004TWZF|3.0|I bought this DVD hoping to relive the experience I had watching it as a young boy and cinematically it is still beautiful but I now realize why they took out the cheesy French music for the American release. Bill Conti's score was much more powerful and I cant even watch the directors cut with the sound on because of the ridiculous Euro-disco-80's-synthesizer style score.<BR>What garbage..............GET THE OLD VERSION ON VHS IF YOU CAN FIND IT
B00000G3Q4|5.0|After just a half an hour of watching The Evil Dead I was blown' away at what a great and notable job the collage studnts that made this groudbraker as good as they did, and scary too.<BR>As a matter of facted I think reson that The Evil Dead was created so skillfuly buy kids not much older than my 15 year old self, is reson enough to call this cult classic the best( if not one of the best) horror films ever created, just like what almost everyone ealse thinks, even though it takes bits and peaces out other classics like House on Hunted Hill, (the overly long) Night of the Dead seires and my personal favorite The Exoricist.<br />The story begins with a five collage bubbies going up to the hills for the weaked just to have some fun, but what they get instead is the satanic Book of the Dead wich is an old book put together by human flesh and writen in blood, and it opens the doors to another world I don't anyone would like to spend much time. One by one the kids die in very, very, very bloody ways. That is the reson why even if your expecting alot of gore it might be just to much. Sam Rami shows us brains smashed up, rolling body parts and the whole nine yards as far as lots of gore gose, but I think that how gorey the sepcial effects are   is reson to love this even more, because even the special effects have some how faded over the years, but we must remember it was only film studnets that made this the hit was and the hit it deseved to be.<br />This is a great Special Edition disk in mind, but if you don't own this already you might want to wait for the other Special Edition DVD set to come out in a month or so from right now.<br />Just in case you don't want to speand the mony on the newer edition that is soon to be released then I beilve this is this edition is worth every penny.<br />If your a horror fan, and liked this as much as I did then you should pick up a Sepcial Edition copy of The Evil Dead 2, and Amy of Darkness, wich is the third movie from the Evil Dead seirs and is very funny.
B000007638|4.0|I think this album is one of the bestin 1976. Some of the strong tracks are MY love, LET 'em IN, BAND ON THE Run, and Silly Love Songs.<BR> Listening to this live double album on audio disc is very uplifting and enjoyable, the sound quality is very good. I agree with the critic from Rolling Stone magazine, 'Ken Tucker' when he wrote\\"These performances are rawer and more driven than the original recordings, and in many cases much better.\\"<BR> Some high points for me on this disc is when McCartney plays some of his solo hits including the one's from the L.P. {Wings at the Speed of Sound} {1976}. Some of the Beatles's favourites, sound a bit slow and dated ,but the rest of the tracks on the album are above average. I did find both of the discs on the album a little bit short in length.<BR> I can see why McCartney was chosen by the critics as the artist of the year for 1976.I highly recommend this \\"Import\\" audio disc for anyone who is a McCartney or Wings, fan.
0684800713|5.0|Over the years this is a book that continues to draw me back. I can re-read it at various stages of my life and still find that the struggles of Jake Barnes and pals seem fresh and identifiable with modern life. Beyond Hemingway's legendary ability for discriptive prose which brings the country to life, in this book at least, he also shines that talent on the human emotions and frailty of character to which we all at some point succumb.
0446310786|5.0|'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those books shoved down the throats of American teens by the English teachers, as sort of elexir to cure rascism.  When I first read it (at age fourteen) I found it to be a difficult read, and not particularly enjoyable.  Rereading it some thirty years later I now see what all the fuss is about.<br />Firstly, this book is about the thoughts and activities of a young girl growing up in 1930s rural Alabama.  There is very much the innocence (and, ultimately, lost innocence) and wonder of youth in the Harper Lee's prose ... kind of a Dixie version of 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'.  Harper Lee's observations of the rascism and hypocritical society of the times are keenly judged.  My only complaint, albeit minor, is that her prose is too rich - it seems out of place (ie, too adult) for a story about adolescent girl.  This makes 'To Kill a Mockingbird' a deceptively inappropriate book for anyone under, say, seventeen years of age.<br />Bottom line: all the heartbreak of youth during turbulent times exquisitely told.  Worth rereading (time and time again).
B00003CY0V|2.0|Ok, let's talk about the most important part first: Why won't Halle Berry just go away? Worse, why do people keep giving her parts?! She has talent rivalled only by garden tools! Alright, letting it go, letting it go... <br />This was a truly horrible movie in almost every conceivable way. I expected little from it, but then the opening scene gave me hope; the camera work was interesting and unusual, and John Travolta's monologue was also very good. But then the unusual camera work went from creative to overdone, the monologue<BR>ended, the movie began and it was atrocious. It went *beyond* atrocious, and touched on the unbearable.<br />The one redeeming feature? Hugh Jackman. But, much like Angelina Jolie in \\"Tomb Raider,\\" he doesn't have a whole lot to work with. There were times when I simply cringed in embarrassment at the things his character did, most notably the scene with the 10-monitor Super Duper Ultra Mega Extreme Hack-Whiz-Bang 9700, when he's jamming on his hacking and giving these way-too-goofy grins or moans of despair as something evidently doesn't go his way. It's not as if some folks don't get totally into their programming/hacking/sysadmining, and it's not as if we don't talk to our computers and moan in despair, but the way it was done here was just utterly overblown. The whole hacker thing in this movie is just \\"2 xtr3333333m, d00d!\\" It was appalling.<br />About midway through the film, I realized that of course a lot of people don't know what total trash this film talks, and probably will assume that computer geeks really do behave this way, and they might even think it's a good movie, because they aren't distracted by Hugh hacking into the DOJ in sixty seconds with manual typing, or the reference to one of his hacker pals named Torvalds, or how Hugh \\"sees\\" 512-bit encryption in his head and kind of works it all out on his fingers or something, and oh, by the way, Hugh designs his \\"hydra\\" in some kind of CAD/CAM program (don't we all?) [sigh] <br />And then it hit me.<br />I love the movie \\"Pushing Tin.\\" I love it top to bottom, really, not because of any socially redeeming value, it's just fun. \\"Pushing Tin,\\" however, is very likely the air traffic controller equivalent of \\"Swordfish;\\" the ATC staff plays fast and loose with the planes, does the same sort of ultra-hip dancing in their chairs, and are distracted by a myriad of things while trying to land mega-ton aircraft. I'm sure any air traffic controller who saw \\"Pushing Tin\\" had much the same reaction my boyfriend and I did to \\"Swordfish,\\" and probably had the same bruises on their foreheads from bashing them on the seats in front of them too often. Perhaps \\"Swordfish\\" wasn't a bad action film, but I couldn't divorce it from the hacker movie that it so desperately wanted to be. I noticed some clever ideas or shots here and there, but overall...just frustrating. Infuriating. Awful.
B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter has enormous potential - but realizes that potential only once in a while.  This film is the best example of what he can do.  The screenplay, while not bad, isn't particularly compelling, but I can't think of a single film that sustains a creepy atmosphere as well as this one.  In fact, this film would be affecting even without any sound at all, the visuals are that amazing (without computer enhancement or even old-fashioned animation effects).  This film deserves a careful, extravagant DVD transfer - and restoration if necessary.  Should be required viewing in film schools.<br />As an amusing side note:  my bilingual wife & I watched this on TV on the Spanish-language channel.  The dubbed translation was hilariously terrible.  The oft-quoted line at the end, \\"Watch out for THE FOG,\\" became \\"Go outside and look for the fog.\\"  If you've seen this movie, you'll know why this was particularly bad advice.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|\\"Tomb Raider\\" is a perfect example of how many movies from Summer 2001 were about style over substance; this film had great sets and good effects, but little or no meaningful plot or dialogue. Even the lovely Angelina Jolie was unable to save this tripe - she gave it a believable protagonist, because she does a very good Tough Ballsy Chick. However, her lines were awful, and they didn't seem to give her much else to work with, except slut, sultry, amused, sidelong glances. <br />The villians were probably the most laid-back doomsday cult I have ever witnessed, the romantic \\"sub plot\\" was laughable, and even Chris Barrie (of \\"Red Dwarf\\" fame) couldn't make me care about the butler. Oh, the humanity...<br />I went in with somewhat lofty hopes, I'll admit that - I really like Angelina, and the trailers were very pretty. I'd read a few reviews, however, that made me aware that it was probably not going to be all I hoped. I wanted an entertaining, visually appealing little romp, and I didn't get it. I was wholly unprepared for how [bad it would be]. Exiting the theatre, I was somewhat stunned, trying to figure out what exactly it was that made it [as bad as it was]. Turns out that there wasn't much that [wasn't bad], except the sets, the costumes, and the effects. Pity.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Music, my friends, should be about writing good songs.  It should not be about technique only; technique is the beginning of good songwriting, not the end.  With Dream Theater's technique-driven 1999 album Scenes From A Memory the band had it backward.  If they had concentrated on good songwriting first and then enhancing those songs with technique, perhaps SFAM would not have been such bumbling, sloppy CD.  As it was, too many songs on SFAM seem like excuses to engage in showing-off.  We are well aware of how great the musicians of Dream Theater are, thank-you (even if there talents have been exagerated by DT's fanatical fan base).  How about writing a song now?<br />Well, I'm happy to report that Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence displays some very good song writing.  First up is disc one: Drawing upon such influences as Megadeth and Metallica, &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; may be one of DT's best songs.  &quot;Blind Faith&quot; is clearly in a Pink Floyd vein while the excellent &quot;Misunderstood&quot; pays homage to Tool.  &quot;The Great Debate&quot; may be too ambitious lyrically, but sonically it is an outstanding song.  The final track on disc one, &quot;Misunderstand&quot;, is a laid back Floydian tune that never quite takes off.  Disc two is even more ambitious than disc one.  Though it is hard to believe that Dream Theater has the nerve to call this forty minute song one song (it is eight distinctive songs connected together--they could have done this with any eight DT songs), it still succeeds.  The melancholy &quot;About to Crash&quot;, the aggressive &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; and the oddly upbeat &quot;Solitary Shell&quot; are the standouts here.<br />It has been eight long years since Dream Theater has made a truly meaningful CD (I am referring to 1994's Awake).  But Six Degrees does the job.  Though not as great as Awake, Six Degrees comes fairly close.  And it ranks as Dream Theater's second best album to date.  Like Awake, Six Degrees of InnerTurbulence shows us a mature Dream Theater as opposed to the childish, rambling band that made Scenes From A Memory.  Welcome back, DT!
B00003CY5J|3.0|This film turned out pretty well, though with a cast consisting of DeNiro, Brando, Bassett, and Norton, it's nigh-impossible to have a completely miserable failure. It was a pretty generic plot, but it was still entertaining, and I really enjoyed Frank Oz's direction. He made use of a lot of low camera shots and there were a number of scenes with very interesting blocking. Sure sure, DeNiro is the thief with a heart of gold who's just looking for His Last Big Score, and the love of his life<BR>is about ready to leave him because she doesn't believe that This Time He Means It, No Really. Norton plays the young up-and-comer who's a bit too big for his britches. His cover character is &quot;Brian,&quot; an autistic janitor's assistant, which Norton plays brilliantly and convincingly. When not posing as Brian, Norton finds a few excuses to show off his upper torso in gratutous tank top &amp; shirtless scenes. Hey, Ed? We get it that you've beefed up, ok? We got it in &quot;American History X;&quot; you're ripped. Fine. <br />But you still run like a girl. <br />Let's talk about the 400-lb gorilla that everyone pretends not to notice and finds uncomfortable to talk about; Marlon Brando. Four hundred pounds might actually be underestimating him, but I honestly can't hold his weight against him. There were times, though, a scene here and there, when all I could think of was a giant, sweaty, mumbling Sylvester the Cat. He's become a parody of himself with the lisping and the muttering and the heavy mouth breathing. His role is not particularly inspiring, though, so it wasn't as if he had a lot to work with. <br />Speaking of actors who have become nothing but their trademark schtick, I was pleased that DeNiro seemed to take himself less seriously than he has in other recent roles. In films such as &quot;Meet the Parents,&quot; &quot;Analyze This,&quot; and others, it's seemed as if he's doing an impression of himself, rather than trying to actually act. But this role reminds me of his Sam in &quot;Ronin,&quot; which was a nice change. <br />Angela Bassett's role was unfortunately very small - it had a lot of potential, but she wasn't ever allowed to get a full head of steam worked up. Alas.<br />I expected at least one more double-cross than there actually was, because the trailers pretty much gave away two of them - but that's all there were. Well, that's kind of disappointing. There's a little suspense here and there during the final half hour, when The Big Heist is actually taking place, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and the new &quot;Ocean's 11&quot; does it better. Still, it's a decent bubble-gum-for-the-brain kind of movie, a good afternoon flick when you don't want to think about anything too heavy.
B00003CXXO|2.0|A clumsy prologue sets the tone for the entire film.  William Hurt, addressing what first appears to be a classroom but turns out to be a boardroom, identifies the need for a \\"mecha\\" (for mechanical, as opposed to organic) boy capable of true love.  His speech, and the Ben Kingsley narration that precedes it, is the clumsiest bit of exposition I've heard in a long time.  There is nothing poetic or interesting in his words; it is just information.  The remainder of the movie falls into much the same trap. <br />The first act follows a mecha child, David, as he learns to understand his new \\"orga\\" family.  Haley Joel Osment (as David) does wonders with these scenes, playing them rather creepily.  Can you name another child actor who can construct a character as thoughtfully or as skillfully as him?  He is consistent and solid throughout the whole thing, bringing a sense of realism (even in fantastic situations) to everything he does.  That being said, the rest of the act is a mishmash of Kubrickian and Spielbergian, a mix that doesn't go down smoothly.  Kubrick peddled analytical coldness, whereas Spielberg peddles fairy tales.  One style would tend to cancel the other out, and that's just what happens here.  Spielberg does a fine job emulating Kubrick's languid pacing (a trait that always bored me in Kubrick's own work), but he drowns it all in his trademark beatific lighting.  I also felt very conscious of Spielberg's shot selection, consistently framing Osment in very telling ways (one notable shot had him seemingly wearing the kitchen light fixture as a halo).  Spielberg is usually more subtle and confident in his shots.  Here, I felt like he was trying to slam them down my throat.  Or maybe trying to prove something to the late Mr. Kubrick.<br />The second act introduces Jude Law as the lover mecha Gigolo Joe.  Law is usually a fascinating actor to watch, whether it's for his talent or his physical beauty.  He uses both to great effect here.  Although the character is underwritten and is used as nothing more than a crude plot device, Law injects some much-needed energy and a sense of fun into the film.<br />Spielberg actually lets loose in these sections concocting three stunning visual sequences.  The first involves decimated mechas roaming a scrap heap for spare parts, only to be hunted down by envoys from the Flesh Fare looking for sacrifices.  There's one stunning shot of a moon rising over the horizon.  Ominously as it turns out, in a neat renunciation of Spielberg's most famous \\"E.T.\\" shot.  The second sequence is the Flesh Fare itself.  It has rightly been called one of the darkest sequences Spielberg has ever put on film.  Too bad this section was not explored more.  The third sequence involves a trip to Rouge City, kind of a futuristic red-light district.  It's like Vegas, only tackier (if you can believe that).  There are some stunning pieces of sexually suggestive architecture that make you forget for a moment that you're watching a Spielberg film.<br />The final act is misguided, let alone unwelcome.  On the former note, and as many have said before, it is a typical Spielberg ending.  He appears unwilling (or unable) to end the movie on a down note, and thus pushes the deux es machinas panic button.  On the latter note, he's already given us a serviceable enough ending, one that truly cements the nature (and futility) of David's quest to become a real boy (which reminds me: We get that this is an update of the Pinocchio story, Steve; you don't have to keep reminding us ad infinitum).  It would have been a truly sad and perfect ending to a movie that desperately needed one.  Unfortunately, it went on for another half-hour, making me more angry and bored by the minute.  Even though the visual imagery in this section is breathtaking and poetic, it truly stomps all over whatever good faith the rest of the narrative has built up.<br />Other than Osment and Law, none of the rest of the cast does anything to interesting.  Frances O'Connor, who is essentially the third lead, spends too much time in a melancholy and emotional coma.  She is such an ignorant character you wonder why David was so desperate to return to her.  A supertoy Teddy bear (named Teddy, natch) has some inspired moments, just not enough.  And there's a voiceover cameo by Robin Williams that does little to enhance the movie, other than allowing you to remember how funny he was as the Genie in \\"Aladdin\\".<br />Spielberg has made an ambitious but messy movie that will surely appeal to those in his audience content with superficial and unanswered questions.  Those hoping for a little more from his talents will surely be displeased.  Not to mention bored.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Running...screaming...yes, all is as it should be in a good dinosaur romp. The trouble is that there isn't much else to this film, but if you're just looking for a little mindless entertainment that'll have you glancing nervously out your windows at night, this will do, as the Spinosaur is pretty darned terrifying, what with being larger than the T-Rex, and having hands and arms and whatnot. There is naturally a lot of suspense in the film, which of course result in the deaths of all the Red Shirts.<br />They really should have either left out the plot entirely, and gone with only the primal fear factor, rather like a roller coaster ride, or they should have picked up their ... and written an actual reasonable plot that held water. What they presented in the storyline department was simply abysmal. There is incredibly weak dialogue, and human acting that is, for the most part, outdone by the lizards. Sam Neil, whom I normally like, was pretty awful. <br />The dinosaurs, though, were outstanding; the animation is fabulous. They really do look real enough to reach out and touch, even moreso than the previous JP films. I'm a little annoyed, though, with the treatment of the T-Rex and the Raptors. The T-Rex has an exceedingly brief cameo in JP3, during which it battles and is killed by the Spinosaur, just to prove how tough the Spinosaur is. I was peeved that they felt they had to demonstrate how much scarier the Spinosaur was by having it whomp the poor old T-Rex, whose scare factor must have dropped since they used it in the previous two movies, and we needed<BR>something *even scarier*.<br />Scarier.<br />Than a T-Rex.<br />...Huh?<br />But ok, whatever, so there's a new bully in town, and he's hungry. Fine. Let's talk about the Raptors, shall we? The Raptors were very scary in the previous two films, without a doubt. But now, oh no! We've underestimated their intelligence and capacity for communication!! Whatever will we do? Well, for starters, we'll steal their eggs and make ourselves bait, how's that? Ok, steal eggs; check. Make selves bait; check. Run through the jungle like crazed weasels making a lot of racket; check. Yes, we're pretty much guaranteed to get eaten...unless! By gosh, it's so crazy that it just....might....work!! You can almost hear Joel from MST3K speak the \\"alpha\\" Raptor's line for him: \\"Talking humans?!\\" [slapping forehead] The way they escaped the Raptors actually made me say, quite audibly into the dark and crowded theatre, \\"ARRRGH!!\\" Looking to my left and right revealed either confusion (\\"What's her problem?\\") or total sympathy (\\"Amen, sista.\\") The whole Raptor thing in JP3 was a tired old cliche that they were trying to make scary again. Sure sure, they're lurking everywhere. Sure sure, they're smart as hell. Yawn...<br />A huge unexplained plot point is how the heck these new species got there in the first place. Neil, at one point, acknowledges \\"yup, these surely weren't on InGen's list o'critters,\\" and one might think they'd eventually work their way back around to explaining it, but oh well. ... <br />I won't go any further, but there are others.<br />Overall? Somewhat disappointing on a fully-satisfying scale, but it had me clenching the arms of my chair in suspense a couple of times, much to my own surprise. It needed more of the whole \\"impact tremor\\" thing the first movies made good use of - but that's a personal thing, I just happen to find big, huge, footsteps from an unseen large-toothed predator absolutely terrifying. <br />If you go into this without expecting a great plot, you should be pretty entertained by the quality of the dinosaurs, and with the adrenaline-laden chase scenes.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you're looking for a good laugh, Shrek is definetly the movie for you. Mike Myers delivers once again with his hysterical scottish accent, and Eddie Murphy is his usual funny self. I found the movie very enjoyable--a definite stride into the future of kid's animated movies. It's got just the right mix of disney-quality substance with some new-age flair.  The DVD is fantastic--chock full of extra features for your enjoyment. The audio and video quality are great.
0140288503|5.0|I read non-stop (excepting work and sleep breaks) cover-to-cover, and immediately re-read the whole book again.  Wow.  Mark's writing left my ears ringing from the gun fire, sorry for the collateral killings, furious with a government frightened of the press, disgusted with a press lusting after sensation without sense, and in full sympathy for the soldiers who wanted to re-arm and return to get their buddies and Mr Aidid.<BR>Mark underscores how many different perspectives there are on a single chain of events; everybody's hero is somebody else's villain.  After re-reading, I wished I was there, and glad I wasn't: \\"the world capital of things-gone-completely-to-hell\\".
1558216847|5.0|I heard about this book way back in the 1970s...I didn't know the title or the author...I finally stumbled upon an original hardback copy in the Ft Dix Army Library...an incredible adventure....kind of cryptic in style (very common for some translated books) but I rate it 5 stars just for the sheer magnitude of the journey.....a rewrite of this book with expanded sections,maps, diagrams and descriptions of the flora and fauna of the route of the trek would be fascninating....also I recommend consulting  a very good map when reading the book to thoroughly gain an appreciation of the task undertaken by these men and lady.....properly done...this would make one heck of a movie...which would make \\"Castaway\\"  look like a vacation at Club Med...I would rank this journey on par with Shackleton's Antarctic Expedition of 1914...a fiction book entitled \\"the Long March\\"  captures a trek of Polish prisoners from a Soviet-run Gulag...also an excellent read
B00003CXFV|5.0|It's nice to see a movie about a strong woman.  Erin Brockovich is based on a true story. It is a very entertaining film about a single mom willing to work hard to make a good life for her broken family.  The directing is top-notch as well as the acting. The script is well-written and is executed superbly on screen. The pacing is slow at times but my interest in the movie never dwindled. I highly recommend this film!
B000022TSW|5.0|I remember when the show first started off on Comedy Central and I thought it was the funniest show I have ever seen.  When the movie came out I saw it in theaters and hearing the things I heard the characters say in the movie I was rolling around the floor laughing like an idiot.  Its up to Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to save the world from Satan and his lover Saddam Hussein (yes you read that right).  What results is so laugh out loud hilarious you'll be begging for more after its over.  A special note, at the scene where Kenny is going to heaven, then gets denied and goes to hell, that is Metallica frontman James Hetfield singing the \\"Little Boy Your Going to Hell\\" song in the background.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who has a good sense of humor and loves the First Amendment.
B00005RFAI|4.0|... I very rarely buy CDs on the strength of one track, especially nowadays; too often it's just a bunch of filler packed around one awesome song. Knowing that, I kind of held back, even after going nuts the first time I heard &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; during an episode of &quot;Making The Video.&quot; After reading a few pretty positive pre-release reviews, I said &quot;What the heck!&quot; and picked up M!SSUNDAZTOOD upon it's release.  ... I dug it right from the first listen, and have learned to love it even more with subsequent plays. Opening up the disc is the groove-friendly title track. As we hear Pink whisper &quot;Go, Damon! Go, Linda!&quot; and co-producer Linda Perry's squeaked return reply of &quot;Go, Pink!&quot;, we are subconsciously presented with a fact that will become clearer by disc's end: there is an artist/producer partnership on M!SSUNDAZTOOD that is sorely missing from most recordings today....nothing is phoned in, and everyone is doing all they can to make sure everything is done right. As stated, &quot;M!ssundaztood&quot; is one of those tracks that just gets under your skin. With it's boom-box beat, airy vocals and  jangling guitars, it's a total butt-shaker, and will make a smash follow-up single to &quot;...Party.&quot; Next up is &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;, one of the songs on M!SSUNDAZTOOD that proves Pink is so heads and tails above so many of the little girl wannabe singers out there today. With it's angry arrangement and dark lyrics(&quot;Don't let me get me/I'm my own worst enemy/It's bad when you annoy yourself&quot;), it's hard to believe Pink is just twenty-two. If she can be this brutally honest now, imagine what she'll be capable of doing by her fourth or fifth release?!? &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot; is a classic &quot;He-done-me-wrong&quot; song, updated for the 21st century. It's strong chorus(&quot;I can't stay on your life support/There's a shortage in the switch/I can't stay on your morphine/'Cause it's making me itch/I said I tried to call the nurse again/But she's being a little bitch&quot;) is a revelation....Pink sings it ever-so-differently each time, a trick usually grasped only by seasoned pros. And what can be said about &quot;Get The Party Started?&quot; Well, it was one of the top two or three tracks of 2001, one of the Top Ten of the last five years and, eight years from now, when they're reviewing the first decade of the 21st century, it no doubt will still be considered a classic. Simply put, &quot;...Party&quot; is a prime example of why they should bring back singles! Mindless, but, oh so, fun!<br />Next up is &quot;Respect.&quot; As you hear Pink slyly state &quot;This is my rap song!&quot;, all smirks and attitude, you might be inclined to write the song off as &quot;Possuer Girl Wants To Do Hip Hop.&quot; Don't! With it's sing-song vocals and powerhouse grooves balancing a female-empowering lyric that's more educational for the little girls (and boys!) out there than anything else being done by the BrittneyChristinas of the world today, Pink has come up with a socially conscious song that you can really move it to, and when was the last time we had one of those?!? In other words, single #3! One of the things that probably makes M!SSUNDAZTOOD seem more powerful than it ultimately really is is the fact that five of it's six strongest songs are the first five tracks on the CD. The sixth track, the rocking &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, a duet with Perry, is chilling. Written by Perry, Pink makes the song her own. Laid over a militaristic beat, Pink projects the doubt, longing and uncertainty that comes with fame (as well as the persuit of it!). Perry's Greek-chorus harmony vocals add the perfect topping. If Arista can keep this CD alive long enough to warrant a fourth or fifth track to radio, this is the one to push.....it presents Pink in a very different light, and it's one that works very well. Other tracks that work almost as well are the hard-hitting &quot;18 Wheeler&quot;, the Alannis-meets-Edie Brickell, hip-hop flavored &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, with it's confessional lyrics that are honest without being cloying, and &quot;Numb&quot;, another driving rocker. Also deserving of a mention is &quot;Misery&quot;, a duet with Stephen Tyler, on which Pink more than holds her own (once again, it boggles the mind to think what she'll be capable of doing by the time she reaches her 30's and 40's!) and &quot;Eventually.&quot; In fact, the only real clunkers on the disc are &quot;Family Portrait&quot;, another confessional track that Pink trys to to infuse with a depth and experience she just hasn't obtained yet, and &quot;Gone To California&quot; and &quot;My Vietnam&quot;, which are, well, just bad songs. But that's nit-picking.<br />M!SSUNDAZTOOD is 100% better than her dismal, cookie-cutter, flavor-of-the-month debut, and a work of art from a gal who, if she can keep it all together, should keep us entertained - and guessing! - for years to come. &quot;Go, Pink!&quot;, indeed!18 Wheeler&quot;, the Alannis-meets-Edie Brickell, hip-hop flavored &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, with it's confessional lyrics that are honest without being cloying, and &quot;Numb&quot;, another driving rocker.

B00005BJ2O|4.0|This soundtrack wonderfully captures the feeling and spirit of this fabulous movie, and I can certainly recommend it highly. It is a little disappointing that several good tracks from the movie weren't included, but if you don't have the DVD you have to have this soundtrack. Ewan McG. is just wonderful...
B00003CXI1|5.0|i went to see the film on November 17th, and i couldn't get tickets, i had to wait until November 30th, and i sat down to watch, i arrived a little bit late, the scene where Hagrid was arriving on his motorcicle, and from the moment of the snake in the zoo, i was hooked, and i was saying to myself, \\"Man this is great!\\",it's even great for those who haven't readed the book, like some of my friends, who loved it, first of all the script by Steven Kloves is wonderful, he was perfect,but they should have chosen the writers of \\"Stand  By Me\\" the direction of Chris Colombus, was really good, but they could have used Spielberg or Rob Reiner, or Terry Gilliam, the FX were good, but they should have put more job on them, Fluffy looks false, but Voldemort looks great, so does the centaur, and the rest of the FX, man i loved the ghosts, i think it was a good thing they cutted Peeves, it well, could have been like an horror version of Jar Jar Binks, the acting was very good, specially Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman, and  Daniel Radcliffe, it's excellent as Harry though he needs a bit more training on acting, he did a better job on \\"David Copperfield\\", and its truly faithful to the book, but the Norbert scenes that were cutted, and cut and pasted in the movie, well that didn't feel right, but i still think it's an excellent film, number 2 on my 2001 best list.<br />MOVIE:*****<BR>SCREENPLAY: ****1/2<BR>ACTING:****1/2<BR>FX:***1/2<BR>MUSIC:*****
B000002ULO|5.0|Take a good look at all the reviews of this disc if you are unsure about whether this is a true McCartney comeback. No 1 star reviews, and only a couple of mediocre ones. Even the best albums have a couple trashings by reviewers. Not this one. This is the real Paul McCartney comeback.<BR>To be honest, when I got this disc, I was very skeptical. Friends kept telling me how great it was, blah blah, but I figured it was going to be like most of his output from the mid-80's on: Overproduction glossing over songs that just didn't stick in your head like Paul's best work used to with Wings.<br />Boy, was I wrong.<br />From the first song, the hooks are there, the guitar work (courtesy of Steve Miller) is ringing and (thankfully) upfront (no production overkill), and the songs are vintage Paul McCartney. You find yourself humming the tunes over and over, and the Cd just keeps finding its way off my shelf and in my player. This is probably his best work since Band On The Run. No kidding.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I first saw the trailer for \\"Pearl Harbor\\", on TV, it was on July 2000, and i said to my self, \\"A war film by Micheal Bay?!, I gotta see this!\\", i forgot about it for a time, until in January 2001, the buzz for the film started, many people were saying that this film was going to be a great hit, and that it will become one of the best films of all times, and i was laughing out loud for this comments, because Micheal Bay always makes his films look very good, but they end up, being just good.<BR>Well i couldn't catch this one on theaters, so when the DVD came out, i saw it, and man i was really liking the movie, i was laughing ( of the funny situations in the film, like the medical exam, the dance, the scene in the boat), i was also excited, and the film was developing preety fast, the acting was really good, and the cinematography was stunning, i think that what \\"professional\\" critics use is that when they see that a film is going to be a great hit, they bomb it, i was surprised that they didn't do that with \\"Harry Potter\\"or \\"LOTR\\", but sure they will do it next year, or the next after that, and they bomb people so much, so audiences share their dislike for the film, anwyays let's get to the movie.<br />STORY:Hmm, well the love story was good, and it had a really good twist, better than soap operas out there.<BR>SCREENPLAY:No cheesey dialouge, just good old fashioned dialouge.<BR>ACTING:Well,really good.<BR>FX:Man, they were great,they didn't look false in any scene<BR>MUSIC:The soundtrack was very good, but it could have been better<BR>HISTORICAL ACCUARCY: Well about 50% it's accurate, but who cares?!, is just a movie, not a documentary.<BR>RATINGS<BR>FILM: *****<BR>STORY: ****<BR>SCREENPLAY:****1/2<BR>ACTING:****<BR>FX:*****<BR>MUSIC:****<BR>THRILLS:*****<BR>INTELLIGENCE:***1/2
B00005QDW1|5.0|Unbelievable.  I was totally expecting this album to suck, only because the band is so popular now and you'd think Gwen Stefani is getting a swelled head because people are attracted to her tummy. I'm glad I was wrong! This album is just as differently delicious as all the others.  On the surface it sounsd TOTALLY different, but listen long enough and the same magic is there. \\"Making Out\\", \\"Underneath It All\\", love 'em all and they keep on ringing through my head.  Buy it.
0871137380|5.0|This is an exciting book about young American heroes in a bad situation.  It is so well researched that I was amazed.  Mark Bowden really did a great job of following up the outstanding research with great storytelling.  He gave perspective from the point of view of those involved, on all sides of the conflict.  The story that this book tells is extremely important, and is gladly having an impact on the US Military itself!  The amount of violence may be hard for some to read, but to understand what happened in Somolia, this is THE BOOK.
0345404475|4.0|In the old days, owning a beautiful car conferred prestige. A machine that replaced the humble horse, it provoked feelings of excitement, power, control, even love. There were people who gave them pet names and pampered them. As usual, people's standards change to suit the times. In a world ravaged by war, animals are a rarity, and therefore expensive. To own and care for a live animal, not a mechanical fake, is the goal of those who still live on Earth.<br />Rick Deckard lives with his wife in San Francisco. Large sections of this neglected city, like the rest of the world, are empty of people. Many have emigrated to colony planets like Mars to escape the radioactive pollution. Deckard's job is to eliminate (retire) androids. The androids are so life-like their identity can only be proved by a special \\"empathy test\\". Without this test it's impossible to tell who is real and who isn't. Androids supposedly have no empathy. Once they are caught out, they don't last long.<br />Deckard's latest contract is a lucarative one. He has to finish what a previous bounty hunter started, by killing six fugitive androids who concealed themselves among the human population of Northern California. Once the job is done, Deckard will have enough money to buy a real animal.<br />If \\"Blade Runner\\" hadn't been made a lot of people wouldn't have heard of this book. Although I haven't seen \\"Blade Runner\\", it was hard not to imagine Rick Deckard having the face and voice of Harrison Ford. The morality of killing something that seems to be alive makes an intriguing theme. I think a lot of writers since Philip K. Dick have explored this premise. In the SF comedy \\"Red Dwarf\\" androids are programmed to believe in \\"Silicon Heaven\\", an afterlife for dead technology. This makes the androids more accepting of death, the knowledge that they have to be terminated one day to make way for superior models. Many of us believe that after death we enter an afterlife of eternal paradise. Despite this, we do everything in our power to put it off for as long as possible. From the moment of birth we are slowly dying. Nothing can stop it, life gets shorter every second. The new androids in Philip K. Dick's novel have that same desire for self-preservation. But they're at the mercy of someone higher up, one who decides when they've had enough.<br />It looks as if my copy of \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" contains a misprint. In the first chapter of my copy the date is January 1992. Yet another copy indicates it's the 21st century. I thought things seemed a bit too advanced for the 1990s. This is the second novel I've read by Dick, the first being \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\", another after-the-bomb story. I'm currently reading \\"The Man In the High Castle\\". A very good book so far.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I turned on MTV2 five months ago to see the last 30 seconds of the video for &quot;Last Nite.&quot;  To the pleasure of my ears and eyes, I heard and saw possibly the best rock music act since Van Halen's Diver Down. This album is definitely the best album of 2001. IS THIS IT is a family of songs which are related but different in their own special way. &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Soma&quot; definitely highlight the album but in no way would somebody want to skip a track.  This was the answer to my hyporocknia.
B00003CXFG|3.0|Over-edited thriller reminiscent of 70's Sci-Fi like 'The Illustrated Man' and 'Idaho Transfer'. Disappointment seems to have arisen over the fact that it isn't really a monster movie, more a morality play with the forces of nature well in the backgound as a catalyst. Those without a strong interest in metaphysics may feel themselves under-catered for. The film's holiness will make it stand the test of time in my opinion although some vulgar direction and self-conscious profanity is unhelpful at times, at least the cast seems uncomfortable delivering it. Is faith rewarded and does God intervene? Whether it is the Christian God or Allah that shines upon our survivors at the film's close will be hotly debated at length by ooh, absolutely nobody, I should think.
B00003CX5P|5.0|\\"The Phantom Menace\\" alone deserves 5 stars, because it's a really good movie. I just don't understand where all this bad rep is coming from! If you are a true 'Star Wars' fan, then you should appreciate this movie for what it is--the introduction to the whole 'Star Wars' saga. So of course it would be a light, innocent story. Remember...the world of 'Star Wars' wasn't always dark! <br />The action was very good, what you should expect from a filmmaker like George Lucas. The lightsaber battles were especially amazing! The Pod Race was great, too. The acting wasn't even all that bad as most people claim it to be. The lead performances by Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and even Jake Lloyd were all excellent. And by the way, Jake Lloyd was supposed to be portraying the character of a young child...not some adult! So how else was George Lucas supposed to portray the young, nine-year-old Anakin? And yes, Jar Jark Binks was annoying, but I tried my best to just ignore him. Plus, he is a very important character in the 'Star Wars' saga and in the upcoming chapters, you'll understand why. So he wasn't just there for nothing or comical humor.<br />Some parts of \\"The Phantom Menace\\" may have been confusing to audiences who don't know the story of 'Star Wars' too well. But all in all, excellent story and film. A great movie to add to the 'Star Wars' saga and I'm anxiously awaiting \\"Attack of the Clones\\" and episodes 3-9 (well...if George Lucas gets that far!).<br />Now onto the DVD. This DVD for \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is truly an exhillerating movie experience! The DVD extras are alone worth the price as well. Another 5 stars for the DVD. It comes packaged completely in 2 discs. The first disc is the film feature. The picture/sound quality of this movie is absolutely magnificant! There are hours and hours of special features (you could seriously sit down there on the couch and spend half of the day watching the film, and the rest of the day exploring all the features!). <br />The special features include:<BR>*The making of \\"The Phantom Menace\\"<BR>*Commentary made by George Lucas<BR>*Deleated Scenes made especially for the DVD<BR>*Multi-angled storyboard<BR>*Five featurettes<BR>*Award-winning five part Web documentary series<BR>*\\"Duel of the Fates\\" music video featuring composer John Williams<BR>*Exclusive photo gallery<BR>*Theaterical trailers&teaser trailers<BR>*\\"Star Fighters--the Making of the Game\\" featurette by LucasArts<BR>*CD-ROM extras<br />*This DVD is only available in widescreen format, but still worth buying even if you don't have a widescreen TV.*<br />If there is one DVD you can buy this year...make it be \\"The Phantom Menace\\". One of the greatest DVDs of all time! Can't wait for the rest of the 'Star Wars' movies to be out on DVD!
B000001ELR|5.0|I think that this album is, if not THE best, one of the best. It was the \\"Declaration of Independence\\" album for KISS. The KISS Army finally realized who they were and who they weren't. In my personal opinion Vinnie Vincent and Eric Carr saved the group from disaster. I think, that Eric Carr is equal with Peter Criss, but Vinnie Vincent is better than Ace Frehley by a LONG, LONG, SHOT! I mean, their has never been a better combintion in the history of KISS than Gene Simmons and Vinnie Vincent. The highlights of this album are \\"I Love It Loud,\\" \\"War Machine,\\" and \\"Creatures of the Night,\\" which is the seond best album title song in all of heavy metal...If you don't own this...buy it now! Come to think of it, it is the most expensive album I ever bought! I spent [alot of money] in batteries for my CD Walkman within 3 weeks! YOU HAVEN\\"T LIVED UNTIL YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS ALBUM!
B00005V9QJ|3.0|As a &quot;Live&quot; album this CD falls short. Sounds too much like her studio workings. A live album should offer what you've already given us (from the studio) in addition to a personal side fans are not ordinarily privy to. If you already own all of her albums then....you already have this CD. (minus the crowd roars of course)
B000002TQV|5.0|This album was back when Radiohead actually sounded like a band and before they went experimental-crazy.<br />Compare this to Amnesiac and you probably won't even think it's the same band. The Bends (along with pablo honey) have a pop-rock kind of grungy feeling and not an experimental, artistic side. However Thom Yorke's vocals are better here and less whiny sounding. &quot;Street Spirit&quot; is the best song here. It sounds so different from anything else on this album, sounds like it belongs on OK Computer.  All the singles are really good too, but I enjoy all the songs. My second favorite is probably &quot;High and Dry&quot;, then &quot;Black Star&quot;. I recommend this if you like Radiohead's more recent stuff, even though it sounds nothing like this, or if you're just getting into them.
B00001SIES|5.0|This is a fantastic debut album from what I consider to be the best band to come along in a VERY long time.  I bought Muse's second album, Origin of Symmetry, before I bought this one and expected to be disappointed by this first album.  I am happy to say I was more than pleasantly surprised by Showbiz--I was blown away!  Dare I suggest that this album surpasses its follow-up because the songs on Showbiz are a bit easier to grasp the first time around.  The three members of the band are full of so much passion for what they're creating that the energy overflows into the music.<BR>      Play this in your car, and you will be enveloped by a  flood of rich, creative sound that does not sound like Radiohead.  One may draw similarites between the two groups, but in my book Muse wins out for going several steps further with the volume.  I cannot tell you how elated I am that a contemporary band is actually making music worth listening to, and I'm not even a devout follower of the indie/alternative scene.  (To all Queen fans, of which I am one:  it is possible that even Queen weren't this solid on their first album.)  <BR>      If you like music that is lyrically thought-provoking, unique, emotional, and simultaneously loud and beautiful, check this out!  You will not be disappointed.
B00005RYKU|4.0|Money is the root of all evil in this movie -- and lots of evil there is! Two children are orphaned and old neighbors become their guardians. The guardians are really after the children's inheritence to get out of a frighteningly bad debt. The plot takes some twists and turns and comes to a thrilling conclusion that made my palms sweat. I didn't give this 5 stars though since I probably wouldn't be interested in watching this movie more than once -- it was no classic. Leelee Sobieski, young Ruby, steels the show. If she wasn't in this movie, it would qualify only as a B movie at best. Still, entertaining enough to watch, but rent it, don't buy it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie was really good to watch for three hours.The love story was great and the attack on Pearl Harbor was so real that it was like you are watching the real thing.My favorite part is when the Dolittle raid over Tokyo came.It was very sad to see Danny die after he learned he was going to be a father.I recommend that you watch every part of this movie because its very good.
630280082X|5.0|This is the first (and so far, ONLY) movie to successfully profile the history of Blues music, as well as the legend of Robert Johnson and his deal with the devil. The story has several underlying plots, including coming of age, facing hard times, and redemption.<br />While Ralph Macchio shows some slight mechanical flaws, he can (for the most part) successfully pull off guitar-playing abilities. Joe Senaca is great as an elderly Willie Brown, trying to deal with his own demons (although one can't help compare the character to Miyagi, given Macchio's presence).<br />The number one reason for watching this film, above anything else, is the music. It's Ry Cooder's guitar playing and the delta-blues soundtrack that makes this movie, even when the plot itself seems a bit slowed.<br />All in all, this is a GREAT movie!
B00003CXTG|3.0|This movie was very fake and wierd.The action was fake and so was the love story that took up about 85 mins of the movie.The 45 mins of action was ok,but fake.This movie has alot of flaws in it that you can find easily.This movie was ok but needed a little work.The  ending wasa very sad and heartbreaking to see.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|as i was disgusted (!) by this movie as i saw the previews, and avoided it, i finally decided to rent it, to see how right i was.<BR>well, it [was bad]! but there is one good thing about it: SOUND!!!<BR>if you have a good home theater system, youre in for a ride!<BR>the sound quality is amazing, the film is fast and full of, well, intresting tracks.<BR>worth the 2$ rent.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Oh my god.This has got to be the best movie i've have ever seen with a brillant cast it was great.Ben,Josh,and Kate made it great with their sorrows and romances the music made me feel like you were there.You have to see it it is spectacular.The basic points were really good and the extras were perfect and kept you watching for the whole 183 mins its a great movie by Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay if you like I recommend you see &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;.
B00005KHJR|3.0|Oh Viewer, DO beware of those 'quaint' little country villages, and those odd rare rustic customs....and whatever you do - don't look too closely, and turn down that sweet Invitation to Tea, and entertainment......<br />This nice little package of a movie package is quite a neat little treat [2 disc], of this somewhat slightly obscure movie.  More of an 'investigation' by a 'purist shall we say?'Law Officer, who tends to dig slightly too deep into those rural lanes, cottages, graveyards and hearths ......<br />Great performances from Edward Woodward as Our Pure Enforcer, and naturally Christopher Lee, and the rest of the 'gang'.<br />Close cousins to \\"Burn Witch Burn\\", the rarely seen \\"Eye of the Devil\\", and, not forgetting, \\"Harvest Home\\".<br />But don't probe too deeply about 'missing' individuals and Spring Rites or you might find yourself out of a frying pan and straight in to the........!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I didn't like the love story very much.The 65 mins of action was terrific with some of the best special effects i've ever seen.The Japanese actors were good at playing their roles.The music was good,but when Rafe dies and comes back was very silly.The scene where Danny tells Rafe to be the father wasn't good.
0767903862|2.0|Disappointing.<BR>The book seemed rushed, and Bryson too easily reverts to stereotypical Australian characteristics as his subject matter.<BR>He provides very few intuitive insights into the foibles and quirks of the locals, as canbe found in so many of the other books that he's produced. That could possibly be put down to the fact that he has not lived in Australia, and as he appears to have been in some haste to get through his travels in this country, it's perhaps not surprising that he would come out of it with nothing more than a superficial view.
B00003CXTG|3.0|This movie was okay but could've been better.The love story was ok, but could've been better and the action was incredible.If you want to see a movie that focus on the attack on Pearl Harbor.Go see Tora Tora Tora.

If people don't like you, or think you're<BR>  strange, then that's their problem\\" (188).  <BR> <BR>This teen love story takes the reader on a positive emotional journey<BR>through the coming realizations of its main character, Landon Carter, who falls for <BR>Beufort's teen philanthropist, Jamie Sullivan.  Set in a time in North Carolina where <br />poodle skirts ruled and Cecil's Diner was the teen hotspot on Saturday nights, the story of <BR>an unexpected couple unfolds.  Through Nicholas Spark's enticing writing of the familiar <BR>feelings shared by these uncommon seventeen year-olds, a startling realization is made <BR>by discovering Jamie's life-changing secret.<BR>In A Walk to Remember, both of the main characters come from <BR>different worlds.  Jamie Sullivan, the sweet and innocent minister's daughter, is portrayed <BR>as someone who has the highest sincerity and compassion in all of Beufort.  <BR>Unfortunately, her mother died when she was very young, and has been raised by her <BR>protective elder father.  She is an outcast at school (because she wears unfashionable <BR>clothes, no make-up, and her long brown hair in a bun all of the time), yet it doesn't seem <BR>to bother her the least.  Sparks does an excellent job of conveying her personality, for <BR>example: Jamie Sullivan volunteers at the orphanage in the nearest big town, and collects <BR>donations in tin cans from all of Beufort's businesses in order to buy Christmas presents <BR>for all the helpless children.<BR> On the other hand, Landon Carter doesn't take time volunteering or<BR>helping others in need.  He is popular in high school, and regularly makes fun of <BR>Jamie behind her back with his tight group of friends.  He lives in a prodigious historical <BR>house with his mother, for his father is a congressman and is oftentraveling.  That is one <BR>of the only lifestyles that the pair has in common; in both families one parent is always <BR>absent from their lives.  As a school rebel, he has never experienced true compassion  <BR>towards others until Jamie rolls into his life.<BR> The novel rushes the reader to relate to an almost too familiar<BR>scenario that many high school age teens (and adults!) act upon everyday: the judgment<BR>of a person's outward appearance.  When Landon is forced to spend time with Jamie <BR>through a school play production, he begins to understand Jamie's inner dreams, and <BR>realizes that she is truly a beautiful human being.  After the reader acknowledges <BR>Landon's early-on mistakes, a stunning realization can sometimes come to sight with <BR>his/herself.  A novel that moves or compels a person to change his/her's incriminating <BR>habits are genuinely a noteworthy piece in modern day young adult literature .<br /> Nicholas Spark's A Walk to Remember:  a mind moving, heart-<BR>gripping story that inspires the unyielding to broaden their perspective.<br />Works Citied:<br />Sparks, Nicholas.

6304078102|5.0|Mr. Holland's Opus is about a struggling composer who has to teach at a local high school as a music teacher to support his pregnant wife Iris. Mr. Holland soon becomes a father to a deaf son. He has difficulties relating to his son since he can not hear. The story follows Mr. Holland's career and his personal life with his son Cole. When Mr.Holland plays at his son's school that is when he starts to become closer with Cole. All this time he is putting his own dreams of composing the Great American Symphony.<BR>My favorite part is at the end when Mr. Holland enters the auditorium. Every one is on their feet claping for all that he has done for his students. It is at that moment that he gets to play his Great American Symphony. The story ends just as the synphony ends.

B00005NWM3|4.0|Many people catagorize Nickelback as \\"the return of rock,\\" and while they do have some powerful songs, it was a bit disappointing. From their first single off this album \\"This Is How You Remind Me,\\" I liked the sound, and really thought they would have something undeniable to offer. What did I get? <br />The album starts off well with \\"Never Again,\\" a song about an abused wife. Unfortunately, it rather reminds me of the Dixie Chicks' \\"Goodbye Earl\\" with a few profanities to replace the funny lyrics. <br />After that, \\"How You Remind Me\\" starts. It's a truly great song, but we've all heard this one so much by now, it's almost exhausting to hear it again.<br /> Woke Up This Morning strikes me as neither remarkable or or terrible-this is how most of the album strikes you- it just goes out of your head as soon as you've heard it. <br /> Too Bad is a good song, nothing exceptional, but good. It has a very memorable chorus and beat (A good thing in rock music) but the rest of the lyrics escape your midn almost immediately.<br />The next worth mentioning is track 7: Look What Your Money Bought. It's a song with a good point and good melody. <br />The rest of the album is somewhere in between. It's not bad, but it's not the best of rock. Nickelback have some very powerful songs here, but their style still needs some work. Very little sounds like \\"How You Remind Me,\\" and still fewer have the deep thought of that song.<br /> In any case, I recommend trying this album, it grows on you.  Whether you're a die-hard rock fan, or even a pop/adult comtempo fan, it's worth checking out.
B00004Z459|5.0|When I decided to try Linkin Park, I realized I was taking a risk. In a general sense, I like hard rock and heavy metal only in healthy amounts. This album is completely different, however.<BR>The melodies are undeniable, from their ground-breaking &quot;Crawling&quot; to the song that changed the rock game last year &quot;In the End,&quot; you can't overlook Linkin Park as the new millennium's greatest in rock. <br />The album has it's low points: &quot;Points of Authority&quot; drags a little for me, but the greater portion of it is simply fantastic. Songs like &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and &quot;Papercut&quot; are sheer genius. This is an album everyone should try- and the lack of swearing all the time makes it an album everyone can.
0553213105|4.0|I found this book to be humorous and light-hearted.  It was also satirical about society during the eighteenth century. Historically, the book was accurate and interesting. The book had a variation of themes; comedy, romance, irony, and so on. The style of the book enables you to feel the moods of the main characters. I felt hatred for Mr. Darcy and his stubbornness. Mr. Bennet's attitude about his wife and family was witty. Each character had their own unique characteristic, which showed the differences and faults of society.<br /> The situation between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy grows along with their love. The irony of how subtle their love has grown for each other is very entertaining. No one truly believed that Elizabeth loved Mr. Darcy rather she was spiteful towards him. But as the book progresses, she learns about her harsh judgments about him and falls in love for him. Her sister, Jane does not even believe in this love.<br /> The book also shows how life sometimes works out for the better when expecting the worst. The complications and different views on marriage show how people do not think a like. Charlotte Lucas, Lizzie's friend, does not believe in marriage for love, rather she thinks marrying comfortably is more than enough. In life, there are ups and downs, along with each human being. She rather learns about them after she is in wedlock, then learning before hand. Although everyone believes that Jane and Mr. Bingly would be married and loved each, conflicts occur. Different people, separating the two, misled Mr. Bingly and Jane. Luckily, the truth is learned and things work out. Lizzie has the most conflicts of them all. She finds a new guy that she likes, but realizes she loves the person who she least expected it from, Mr. Darcy.<br /> Overall the book was well written and I enjoyed the letters from others, showing each person's different perspective and styles. The details and descriptions are magnificent and captivating.
0783225857|5.0|Does anyone else know this?   As always, many of Lee's characters in this growing-up novel were based on actual people from her past, including a strange, but very bright little boy who lived next door and became &quot;Dill&quot; in the novel.  That little boy's name was Truman Capote.
0140288503|5.0|This is the first book on battle that I have ever read. I never thought that a book can capture the savagery and adrenaline of war until I read this book. I felt my heart pounding throughout. I saw the movie as well, but it does not compare to the book. Highly recommended...
B000006045|4.0|Only Massive Attack could have got me into the Trip Hop scene.  Without these guys and specifically this CD, I would have never stretched myself beyond my self-made rock box.  The first I heard from these guys was something off \\"Protection,\\" and I thought, \\"Man, this is hip hop or something.\\"  I didn't really like it.  But it was infectious as anything I had ever heard.  It stuck with me.  I found myself running home to listen to \\"Tear Drop.\\"  Finally, I broke down and bought this CD and have never turned back.<br />Since that time, I have purchased albums by Portishead, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Lamb, Tricky, and a few others.  And as much as I like all these artists (esp. Lamb) nothing really compares to Massive Attack for me, and this is their best CD.  Most will mention \\"Blue Lines\\" as their masterpiece, and it is amazing - it gave the dance music world a whole new face back in '91, and how groundbreaking that must have seemed back then - but song for song, I find this one to be the better of the two.  \\"Angel\\" is one their best songs and kicks off this set.  True, the vocals showcased has such thick vibrato it could be cut through with a knife, but just like the band itself, it's aquired taste.  I find \\"Inertia Creeps\\" to be their best virtually unknown single, despite being played recently on a Victoria Secret commercial.  Massive Attack really let their juices flow on \\"Risingson\\" and \\"Man Next Door,\\" while \\"Black Milk\\" and the infamous \\"Teardrop\\" are much more laid back and beautiful.  But for whatever mood, this is it!  One of the best star-gazing albums of all time, this is what epitomizes trip hop music.
B000002UB3|5.0|This album stands out to me as one of the Beatles best.  It (like all of the Beatles works) has a sound all its own, but this period of the their music is best defined by this album being the most complete of the post Sgt. Pepper era.  The ragged sound of The Beatles and Let It Be cannot be found here as this album is a polished studio album devoid of studio tricks, but full of life and feeling.  There is a personal feel to the album, almost as if the band wanted to leave with a bang and reclaim their rock n' roll roots (listen to the three person guitar solo in &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;/&quot;Carry That Weight&quot;/&quot;The End&quot;).  Combined with sensative works like the beautiful &quot;Something&quot;, Abbey Road completes the Beatles experience.
B000003TBP|5.0|Wow.  Putting a finger on a single point of \\"Odelay\\" may be as difficult as catagorizing it's genre(s).  But if I hold anything against Beck Hansen it won't be his genre-hopping.  His maddening talent, quircky nonsensical lyrics, broad musical stylings, and a head rooted in good old rock and roll all come together on \\"Odelay.\\"  Critics hail this as his best, and for once they agree with the fans.  Getting into Beck-- I mean REALLY getting into Beck-- was really more of a recent thing, and I enjoyed \\"Midnite Vultures\\" the best.  I found the lyrics hysterical and his talent comforting.  But it wasn't until I re-discovered \\"Odealy\\" that I really understood how deep Beck's musical roots ran.  <br />Boasting a handful of singles, riding the momentum of 1993's \\"Mellow Gold,\\" and thanks to \\"Where it's At,\\" the single that seemed to be in the right place at the right time, it's no wonder that this album turned some heads.  But the way that Beck tore the listener back and forth through the album from high waves of pop tunes to underwater soul and hip hop, the fact that critics hailed this as one of the 90's most essential records isn't much of a mystery either.  Beck flexed muscles of rap (\\"Hotwax,\\" \\"Where it's At,\\" \\"High 5\\"), rock (\\"Devil's Haircut\\"), pop (\\"The New Pollution\\"), and coutry western (\\"Lord Only Knows,\\" \\"Sissyneck\\"), among others.  And the non-conforming styles makes you wonder, if Beck was so busy experimenting, did he even realize that he had put a masterpiece to tape?
B00003CY0V|2.0|Swordfish was a very bad movie. I gave it 2 stars because of its great cast and the 360 shot of the hostage blow up, but other than that I really disliked it. I thought Hally Berry did a great job acting nervous when Hugh Jackman found the wire on her. John Travolta was okay as the \\"villian\\". The director, Dominic Sena, I think did a pretty bad job. The part were Hugh Jackman drops off his daugther and the police chase him while he falls and slides down a hill was horribly shot.<br />The movie is about the biggest hacker in the world who gets out of jail after taking 20 hostages and blowing up one causing the best scene, which is a 360 degree view of all the glass breaking a police men flying through the air. Halle Berry goes and talks to Hugh Jackman who was also a great hacker. She wants him to go to her boss, John Travolta(the hacker), and make a deal. After hesitation he goes. When he gets there a guy puts a gun to Jackman's head and Travolta says he has 60 seconds to hack into the government's files and says go. While hes doing this a lady is doing something to him but I'm not gonna say. He doesn't do it in the 60 seconds and they shot him but there are no bullets in the gun and he did hack into the files. <br />The movie gets worse as it goes on and loses its point of view. It gets really confusing because one second they are doing something and the minute later they are doing a totally different thing. If you want to waste your hard earned money go ahead and see this but if you want to save your money I'll give you one hint. . . DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. IT HAS NO SENSE OR PLOT TO IT AT ALL!
B000002UAX|4.0|1968 will either be remembered as a time in Beatles history in which they were past their prime or in the spring of muscial life.  I tend to lean toward the latter, and having grown up on the late 60's Beatles albums, I usually get bombarded with hate mail when I refer to anything prior to 1966 as suffereing from a lack of diversity.  \\"The White Album\\" to me is home in Beatle Land.  I didn't get to that point by taking the music at face-value- there's some serious depth here.  But the listener that really enjoys a CD like this is the variety seeker, the man who shuts ears to the radio out of boredom.<br />Both haters and lovers of the White Album will agree that this has teh widest range of influences of any Beatles album.  A little blues (\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"Yer Blues\\"), a little stripped down acoustic ballad (\\"Blackbird,\\" \\"I Will,\\" \\"Mother Natures Son\\"), just the right amount of hokey pop (\\"Back in the USSR,\\" \\"Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da,\\" and \\"Honey Pie\\"), and a little good old rock and roll (\\"Glass Onion,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" and \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun.\\")  Throw in at random, mix well, top off with less than perfect production and somehow you come up with one of the greatest albums of all time.  Hard to say HOW so many people like this one; it's all over the map, and the Beatles were on less than affable terms with each other.  \\"White Album\\" is pickings from four different solo albums (well, three.  Sorry Ringo.).  But what results may be as far as some people stray off the pop-rock line, so be thankful for albums like this.
B00005RYKU|5.0|The Glass House is one great movie by a beginning director, Daniel Sackheim. Every shot is so perfectly smooth and perfect in every way. I love when the house is dark becuase it adds to the mystery. This film had a great cast. Ruby(LeeLee Sobieski), Rhett(Trevor Morgan), Terry Glass(Stellan Skarsgard), and Erin Glass(Diane Lane). Leelee Sobieski is a great rising actress who is sure to reach the top one day. Trevor Morgan is also pretty good who starred in Jurassic Park 3 and The Patriot. <br />The DVD is pretty good but I was disappointed because there was only one deleted scence and deleted scenes are always my favorite to watch. The picture is perfectly clear throughout the whole movie and the sound is so amazingly great is unbelieveable to your ears.<br />The movie is about the Baker Family. They are ovioulsy a loving family and a family like everyone else. Mr. and Mrs. Baker are a loving couple who care so much about their kids. Ruby and Rhett Baker are like any other kids. They fight. Ruby and her friends stay out at night and Ruby smokes behind her parents back. The night of her parents anniversy Ruby is out late again. When she steps out of the car she smells like smoke so she sprays herself with perfume. When she turns the corner to her house she sees police. She automaticlly thinks her parents called them because they were worried about her. In her house she finds out that her parents were in a car crash and they died. After hearing all this she faints from shock and horror.<br />It then shows her at their funeral. When the priest is done speaking he lets Rhett say a few words but Rhett breaks sown in tears. The Glasses rush up to assist him and Mr. Glass talks about the Bakers for a minute. When outside Ruby is approached by their Uncle Jack who they haven't seen since they were kids. He says that if they ever need any help they can just call him. When Ruby gets home she talks with Mr. Alvin Begleiter who was their parents trust agent. He says that her parents said that if anything ever happend to them that they would trust the Glasses to take care of them. He gives Ruby his card then leaves as Mr. Glass enters. Ruby thanks Mr. Glass. In the nxt scene Ruby and Rhett are moving out of their house to go live with the Glasses. When they arrive at the Glasses house they are surprised. Their house is huge and almost everything is glass. When they are shown their room they are sort of disappointed because they have to share a room. But they get over it because at least the Glasses accepted them. <br />As the movie goes on Ruby finds out horrible things about the Glasses. She discovers their terrible secrets and gets really nervous and afraid. I don't want to tell you anymore because this movie is so phenomehaly great. I'll gurantee you will love this movie.
0790729644|5.0|In a way this is the Western to end all Westerns. It doesn't pull any punches. It's dark and somber, there are very few gunfights and there is little of that catsup looking blood they used in the sixties ones. This is the anti-western. It makes you wonder why you liked these movies in the first place, these are dispicable people. That being said you still can't not admire Eastwood's charecter, as flawed as he is. <br />The movie bookends itself flawlessly, making you wonder what the whole point of it all was in the first place.
0792162803|5.0|The skits of the unpopular, ugly, catholic school girl, Mary Katherine Gallagher(Molly Shannon) on Saturday Night Live have always been my favorite. When the movie came out I was waiting to see it, but the theather next to me only plays certain movies so they didn't get that one in. When it came out for rental I rushed to the rental store and grabbed a copy. I LOVED IT! The cast was great and it was all put together nicely.<br />Superstar is about a girl in a Catholic high school that has the dream of being famous and have a big Hollywood type kiss. But at school no onw likes her and when she walks down the hall she gets made fun of. Her remark to all of this is \\"Did you know that I'm rubber and your glue so anything you say bounces off of me and sticks right back on you? So put that in your back pocket\\". The boy she likes, Sky,(Will Ferrel's character) is the most popular guy in school but hes dating the most popular girl, Evian(played by Elaine Hendrix). She gets the job at the local rental store as the Rewind Girl so she can study all the movies that need to be rewound. As the movie goes on Mary gets put into Special Ed. and makes a best friend, Helen. Helen is a really hyper kind of person. When they are having lunch they see that they are putting up a sign for a chance to \\"be an extra, in a movie with psitive morel values\\". Marys chance to stardom! She decides to try out but when asking her grandmother if she can, she says absolutly not. She then tells Mary to have parents were stomped to death at a step dancing compition. The next day Mary still trys out...The rest is so histarical that i don't want to tell you. So go rent this movie right away. And enjoy it like I did. I hope you like it and thanks for taking your time to read my review. SUPERSTAR!!!
