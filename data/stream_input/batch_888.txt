B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody was such a pleasant surprise to me. A great talent, and to think we are fortunate to hear her at all. The arrangements on this recording are refreshing. I hope to see her live sometime.
B000Y9PILI|4.0|Should this dvd-a keep playing repeatedly? As soon as it finishes the last track, it just goes and starts with track 1 again. I would expect it to just go to the menu. Also if I hit them menu link while playing a track, it jumps to the menu for a second and then just goes back to track 1 and starts playing again.

B0019OP0GU|1.0|this was a real downer.  The young girls were alway worried about money and doing danceing to help pay for bills.  While paying the bills was a good reason to begain with, the girl become selfish.  They built little friendship or respect of each other.  I could have watched the true life story of any troubled child actor's if I wanted to watch children act for just the money.    The girls in the movie danced and acted because they hand to and in the end they really never learned anything but to keep working even if it was hurting the family.  In the end the family is pulled apart and but since everyone gets what they want it's ok.  Right?!  Keeping the family together and letting the girl have childhoods is not as important as getting the money.  By the way, the girls only have to go to dance school, never mind making their own dress or cleaning their rooms or cooking.  Their parent will do all that.  What a joke.  I would never show this to my nieces because I would hate it if they ended up a spoiled and selfish as these girls.

B000WE660M|5.0|Blackout by far is one of Britney's best albums, and by the looks of her \\"The Circus Starring Britney Spears\\" Tour she agrees.  This edition of the Blackout album is the best because it includes 3 unreleased songs and an unreleased remix, which all add to the greatness that is this under-promoted and highly under-estimated album.<br /><br />Outta This World is a sweet up-tempo ballad about love; \\"your love is outta this world, how you bring me down to earth, I love how you put me first\\".<br /><br />Everybody is a amazing sexed-up rendition of the classic \\"Sweet Dreams\\".  \\"Everybody, come on get to jumpin'. Everbody, movin' next to somethin'. Everybody, feel the temperature rising. Everybody, Come on lets keep grindin'.  Everbody get down and do what you want to, the night is still young to be seduced\\".<br /><br />Get Back closes out the album's new songs by bringing Britney and Danja back together for a final encour performance.  She started the album by giving you more and ends it with \\"If ya can't take it, then Get Back!\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this Bonus edition of Blackout, but if you're not interested in the price, in the least check out the regular edition of Blackout, it is well worth the price.  Britney's greatest album to date!!!
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Great visual and audio, definitely cleaned up for the Blu-Ray release! For a 30 year old film, it can still compete with some of today's films. You won't be disappointed! BUY IT!
B000002KKC|5.0|After the hugely-successful Rumours, almost anything Fleetwood Mac came up with was bound to be viewed as a disappointment, and so it was with Tusk, an underrated but ambitious and vastly satisfying record. Tusk was a little more experimental than Rumours, but don't let that scare you. There were several very strong pop songs on Tusk, including Sara, Think About Me and the title track, a wonderfully wacky song replete with the USC marching band. But there are several other gems on here, including the beautifully hypnotic Brown Eyes (pay particular attention to the guitar flourishes Lindsey adds to the song).  But it's Stevie Nicks who really sparkles on this record, especially on tracks like Storms (a soulful song that is easily as good as anything she's done), Beautiful Child and Sisters Of The Moon.  In many ways, Tusk was a landmark album, and not just because of the way it was produced. Like a lot of people I was disappointed the first time I heard Tusk; now it's one of my favorite Fleetwood Mac records and one I still listen to on a frequent basis.
0307341569|3.0|Libby Day was 7 years old when her brother murdered her mother and two sisters. Libby has spent 25 years believing that, and not particularly caring about it, but now she is finally starting to question what really happened on the night her family was killed-- not because of any curiosity of her own but because she has run out of money to live on and the only way she has of making money is by finding out information for a fan group that is obsessed with notorious crimes.    First let me say that Dark Places by Gillian Flynn is technically well written. Flynn does a masterful job of developing her characters; Libby, for instance, is not particularly likable, is largely out only for what she can get by sponging off of others. Her mother, before she was killed, is frequently lost and bewildered as event around her seem to spin out of control. Her father is a drunken sot who, like Libby, has lived his entire life sponging off of others and taking whatever he can get.    Flynn also does a good job of describing the setting-- this is no idealized view of poverty, no heroic mother scrubbing toilets by night so her children can have a better life by day. This is a family who is just barely holding it together and a mother who is just barely able to cope-- and sometimes doesn't cope.    So for that, I commend Flynn for creating such a believable picture of the rural poor in a small, midwestern community. But I have to wonder why she would write such a nasty, dirty sort of book, and I mean dirty not in the colloquial sense but dirty in the sense of grime, the type of grime that accumulates when a place is never, ever cleaned.    There were actually two resolutions to the book, one of which was a surprise and the other of which was pretty obvious. The book just barely held my interest, and I was really glad when it was over.     So if you are looking for an escape from reality, this book is not it. It's probably a little too close to reality for many folks. However, if you want to read a not particularly riveting psychological study of not particularly savory people, then give this a try.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|While I know the purist might blanch at the enhanced and updated special effects, for me it was a delightful breath of fresh air from an old friend. The stories are still great! The characters are wonderfully classic! This set took me back to a time before email, tweets, blogs and web-casts. I highly recommend this ray of comforting light as a way to soothe nerves jangled by the new Dark Ages.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|I could not wrap my head around the fact that Jeremy Irons played a cowboy with a very bad western/southern/cowboy accent. I am sorry, but he just could not pull it off. He is too sophisticated and polished of a British actor to be playing a cowboy. Renee Zellweger was out of her element in this film. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen work well together. I can see them as a team. The story moves too slowly and it bored me to tears to be quite honest. For cowboy/western movie fans, this will definitely work. Sorry my review was not too favorable.
B001TODCII|2.0|Liam Neeson is a good actor and the fact that he seems to be taking the role seriously makes this film better than it ought to be, but it's still basically garbage. Well-filmed, tightly-edited garbage. All the dialogue, every character who is introduced -- nothing is handled with even the slightest, faintest hint of subtlety or nuance, as though the screenplay was written by a 12 year old who's never been outdoors.
0887308589|5.0|Don't be ridiculous, management is not a subject for a 'science', that's crap. But it is a serious subject and it deserves to be be analyzed better than most 'consultants' do. (I admit that consultants and investment bankers are the black sheep in my personal arsenal of values.)<br /><br />Thinking hard, at times, about the subject, it occurs to me, that nobody understood 'management' better than Scott Adams in his first book on the Dilbert Principle. If I had to list the required reading on management (that is if you were interested in that), I would be fairly simple with a list of 3: apart from Dilbert, all you need is Peter Drucker, who invented this 'science' (these Austrians are everywhere, but this one is an acceptable version), and Tom Peters, who turned Drucker into pulp non-fiction with In Search of Excellence and the sequels.<br /><br />My most intensive encounter with Dilbert happened in upstate New York in 1996. I participated in a 4 weeks management course of Columbia University in Harriman, their summer resort. It was gorgeous. Except, I broke a foot during the first week, during football, what you guys erroneously call soccer. After that, I spent most of my free time in my room or the terrace, reading Dilbert, laughing my head off, eating and drinking too much, while my peers explored the neighborhood, which was hard for me with my heavy plaster cast.<br />I can say that I learned plenty during that month, mostly from Adams.

B0010VD7EO|5.0|After having this rare gem of a record in my possession, and more importantly, consistently housed in my car's busted up CD-player for roughly a year I can say that \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" is a record for the ages. Kaleidescopic in sonic reach, they tread eclectic, yet familiar ground laid out by the likes of Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Queen, Pink Floyd, the Flaming Lips, and Radiohead. They then paint over these influences with an 8-bit pyschedelic tapestry that perfectly suits the impressionistic gospel VanWyngarden spins in his lyrics.  They typically deal with us twenty-somethings and our common struggle with coming to grips with growing up in a society where eternal childhood was served up by media as an actual possiblity. It's so easy to dream of excess, of perfect jungle-boogie hideaways where the animatronic funk band never stops playing,the electricity and drugs last forever, and the repercussions never come, but how do you justify the pursuit of this unobtainable lifestyle? MGMT does so by concocting music that plays like a revelation onto the boundless possibilities inherent to life, even the negative ones, and the truth that lies in hope that keeps us all bouyant.  Every song is unique, and represents a highlight in some genre of music. \\"Electric Feel\\" is unabashed funk, as imagined by hippies thousand of years ago and imbued with enough disco soul to survive the collapse of the universe itself. \\"Kids\\" is subversive dance-pop that tries to instil the moral of self-control. \\"4th Dimensional Transistion\\" embodies excessive-pyschedelia in an imaginatively self-deprecating manner. \\"Weekend Wars\\" plays like the gospel for the 2012 world. To round it out, \\"Pieces of What?\\" is powerfuly simple folk, just a man lookin for home.   I can not praise this album enough. It's perfectly paced and executed, has something very interesting to say in every song, and just seems to capture the essence of the late 2000s.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|I am not a good writer so I a keeping this sweet and short.  This has to be one of my favorite albums in a long time.  The music is fast, fun and furious.  From the first song to the last, I kept my radio blasting.  There was not one song I didn't like at all.  Each song is hardcore fantastic.      Whoever they are (speculation known) they have done a great job in me wanting more more and yes more...    I highly recommend this album to everyone (as i have been doing lately)
B000VDDDY6|4.0|As a long-term fan I welcome the special effects updates, but I was hoping for a higher quality of cgi. Still the effects are an improvement over the original.
B001URRXQQ|4.0|\\"Heaven on Earth\\" was Belinda Carlisle's peak on the pop charts.  Her 1986 \\"Belinda\\" album did well enough, but HOE brought her to the top of the charts.  The album had a run of great singles:  \\"Heaven is a Place on Earth\\", \\"I Get Weak\\" and \\"Circle in the Sand\\", accompanied by stylish videos that were played endlessly on MTV.  HOE has been remastered, and with this Special Edition, I was surprised at how well the album has aged.      I always brushed HOE off as a pleasant pop album with some great singles, while the rest of it was fluff.  But the whole album is a solid listen.  Carlisle, like Madonna and Kylie Minogue, has one of the best pop voices, and her summery, feel-good pop is at its best here.  The remaster includes extended and remixed versions of the singles, although I was disappointed that the remix of \\"I Feel Free\\" is not included.  And, although the special edition comes with an entertaining concert from 1988, I wish this edition had included the videos for the singles, since they were a key part of the success of HOE.      But, if you love '80s pop, this remaster is a must-buy.
B000067J1Y|5.0|Just sit back and enjoy. We can all use a good laugh.  I for one will take anything that can make me smile these days and this one did that.<br />Movies and books are my vacation this year.  I will watch anything that Charley Sheen is in.  He's easy on the eyes too.
B001F290E4|2.0|This record puts me in mind of a talented American Idol contestant or a good cover band with an above-average lead singer.  Seal doesn't invest any song with the power and passion of the original soul men like Al Green, Sam Cooke, Curtis Mayfield, Otis Redding and the other artists he covers. If you like Rod Stewart's takes on the American Songbooks or Michael McDonald's forays into the Motown catalog, this cd may be for you.  Me?  I'll stick to the originals.
B00005JPUN|4.0|I can't believe all the bad negative comments on this film. Yes..I've seen all the previous \\"Invasions\\". Even both \\"War of the Worlds\\"..and even \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" and how can we forget \\"The Shining\\".    Is it because it doesn't have an open ending like the other ones as this one has more closure on the storyline of the \\"Invasion\\" films in the past    I can appreciate also the slower \\"thought\\" process of this version. The creepiness of these people once transformed and how well they hide their alien-selves. This storyline allows for the audience to learn more insightful thoughts of the \\"aliens\\" and their viewpoints than in previous versions.     The intro dinner scene of the Doctors thoughts on \\"progressive thinking\\" is brilliant..it's an insightful poignant conversation eluding to a way of thinking most humans are blinded of based on \\"their\\" current living era and of cultures.    I don't think this movie could've been played by younger actors. Seasoned actors and Nicole Kidman was a good choice.    I have also noticed, in the past 20 years..a lack of appreciation for slower developing plots in films. Or is it lack of \\"attention span\\" when someone isn't always getting \\"whacked\\" on the screen or cars getting smashed.    I think what one has to ask when viewing sci-fi films..is \\"Is this what I would do if I was her/him?\\" AND How much fact is going to validate the storyline in this created world.    I think very few sci-fi films allow for full believability. This is of them that satisfies.    I'm finding so many flaws in the new Star Trek and Terminator storylines.    Such as in Star Trek..I don't find it realistic that a Starfleet Officer would eject and \\"chuck\\" a student (in a pod) to a death planet where he would be eaten by huge powerful ferocious creatures!    Terminator: I can't see \\"anti-rejection\\" drugs being available to organ donors in a post nuke setting! Which invalidated the WHOLE movie right at the end!.    I felt this this version of \\"Invasions\\" satisfies completely on this level.  I didn't feel like I was being treated as a complete retard while watching it!    I enjoyed it.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|This item is pretty novel, I haven't seen that many like this, so I thought it might be a fun buy. However, setting up new games take forever, and you always seem to miss a key or two. There is a list of games that have premade profiles, which work fairly well. The device itself works great, just understand that some of the keys get kind of cluttered together in a gun fight.
0385341008|5.0|The author's use of personal letters to unravel the stories and characters of Guernsey Island during the German occupation of the small island was very effective.  The characters came to life as vividly as any video. By selecting a small island and a close knit group of neighbors for this book, Mary Ann Shafer provided a highly personal \\"micro-study\\" of war's impact on the daily lives of regular people.  Her characters demonstsrated the strength and creativeness of humanbeings as they determinedly attempted to maintin their routines and sanity.
B00068NVI4|4.0|I love this this music and the people who play it more than I know how to say, so I feel I owe them, and all longtime fans, full honesty in my review.<br /><br />A magical set with gorgeous lighting, great technical production, some preciously seldom-performed songs, and a charming acoustic set, are the highlights of this DVD set.  In particular, the acoustic blues treatment of Roundabout was a stroke of genius, almost self-deprecating in a gentle sort of way, reminding me of The Who's My Generation Blues from The Kids are Alright.<br /><br />I found myself brought to tears of nostalgia at moments, although there was a little sadness behind those tears as well, as each time out Yes performances, and Jon's voice, get a little more raggedy and inconsistent. The only player consistently in top form in these latter years is Alan White, as lately even Steve and Rick have to drop notes to keep up the pace.<br /><br />To be completely honest, I haven't heard a live Yes show that is brilliant and vital from end to end since the ABWH and Union tours of 1989-1992.<br /><br />I feel many of the positive reviews of recent Yes DVDs to be written by fans so glad the band is still playing, they are not frank about the rough edges and sometimes lackluster performances.  There is nothing wrong with finding these less-than-best performances enjoyable and worth buying. I do not regret my own purchase, but in the future will take some of these effusive reviews with more than a few grains of salt.<br /><br />I, too, am glad the band is still playing from time to time, and in particular find parts of the earlier Symphonic Live DVD to be performances as essential as anything they have ever done before.<br /><br />So, with some trepidation, I will lend some trust one more time to the enthusiasm of my fellow fans and go ahead and order the 2003 Montreux show, hoping that it captured one of those good nights, or at least has enough post-production cheats to cover the blemishes and fill the gaps.

B000OCXF0Q|3.0|If you like the song \\"Girlfriend\\" a lot, and I mean a whole lot, then the limited edition CD+DVD of \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" from Avril Lavigne is probably for you.  Out of the 17 tracks on the CD, three of them are versions of \\"Girlfriend\\", and if that isn't enough, then you will also have three video versions on the DVD.  For me, this was much too much in the way of \\"Girlfriend\\".  No doubt it has a catchy tune and the cheerleader like cadence to it is somewhat appealing; but the lyrics are juvenile and mean spirited.  I am sure there are many who like this piece, given how much airtime it received, but for me it is only so-so.  The lyrics might have been okay when Avril Lavigne was 17 and fresh on the scene, but a 22-year-old should have put high-school behind her.  This leaves me with a rather mixed reaction to the song, and that carries over to the whole CD+DVD set as well.     \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" is Avril Lavigne's third album, and was released on April 17th of 2007.  The opening track is the aforementioned \\"Girlfriend\\", though since it is the \\"Mature\\" version it includes some rougher language than what one sometimes hears on the radio.  The second track is \\"I Can Do Better\\" and the obvious retort is that she definitely can (and fortunately does) do better, starting with the very next track.  \\"Runaway\\" is where the album begins for me; it is the kind of song you want to hear from her, and it makes the listener remember how nice it was to finally hear some pop music with a rock base to it as opposed to the dance oriented offerings of so many others., \\"The Best Damn Thing\\", and \\"When You're Gone\\" are two more strong tracks which help make the opening two pieces a distant memory.  This brings us to \\"Everything Back but You\\".  One might think that I wouldn't like this song after bashing \\"Girlfriend\\", but I find this to be one of the songs I like the most on this album.  I suppose it is because she is the person wronged and so when she lets loose with the name calling it is more acceptable, and when it comes down to it, it is a flat out hilarious lyric.      The second half of the original album opens with \\"Hot\\".  It is decent, though not quite up to the level of some of the other pieces, and in particular to that of \\"Innocence\\" which follows it.  The album then hits a brick wall with the horrible \\"I Don't Have to Try\\", which is easily the worst song on the album.  I can appreciate that she is trying different sounds and styles, but this one just doesn't work at all.  Things improve with \\"One of Those Girls\\" though it isn't as strong as the earlier pieces - it is much better than \\"I Don't Have to Try\\".  \\"Contagious\\" is roughly similar in quality as \\"One of Those Girls\\".  \\"Keep Holding On\\" is a decent closer for the original album, but the flow which had developed from \\"Runaway\\" through \\"Innocence\\" had already been disrupted and was not restored.      There are five bonus tracks included; the first two are \\"Alone\\" and \\"I Will Be\\", both of which are solid additions to the album, and the latter being the better of the two.  Next is an acoustic version of \\"I Can Do Better\\" which is much worse than the electric version, and one has to wonder why that particular track would have been selected for an acoustic version.  The final two tracks are two additional versions of \\"Girlfriend\\", the first being The submarines' Time Warp '66 mix, and the second being the Dr. Luke remix with Lil Mama, the latter of the two being the more interesting of the two.    There are two sections on the DVD, the first is a series of live tracks including the wonderful \\"Everything Back but You\\", \\"Girlfriend\\" (of course), \\"Hot\\", and \\"When You're Gone\\".  The second section is the videos, which includes \\"Girlfriend\\", \\"When You're Gone\\", \\"Hot\\", and (you guessed it) \\"Girlfriend\\" - the Dr. Luke remix version with Lil Mama.    With nearly a quarter of the selections on the CD and DVD combined being variations of \\"Girlfriend\\" it is no wonder that one might have had enough of it by the time one has made it to the end.  I am sure that it appeals to an audience which buys a lot of CDs, and that is no doubt why it is featured so heavily.  In my opinion that is a shame, because Avril Lavigne may well have much more to offer if she is allowed to develop and grow as a songwriter and performer.  There have been promising signs on all her albums, and let us hope that she moves in a new direction before she finds herself singing songs like \\"Girlfriend\\" in her 30s and 40s to a bunch of people trying to recapture their youth.  This is an uneven album, with highpoints as good as anything Avril has done, and then there are some moments which make one cringe inside.  All-in-all it is slightly above average, though I have to round it down to three stars.
B001N26GFM|5.0|I found this movie to be deeply moving and profound.  If we could use the test \\"what if it was my own (brother, sister, child)\\" in our conflicts, we would be far more inclined to treat each other humanely.

B001R10BMS|3.0|The idea of an older Sean Connery revisiting his performance as 007 is a pretty irresistible one.  And while Sean looks great he's not afraid to show his age and not look indestructible.  Particularly in the film's early scenes, he's very good and you hope for the best from the picture.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers had to recycle the story of Thunderball one of the best of the EON series and a peerless production.  Once the story gets going, the proceedings just aren't very convincing. Indeed, things here somehow manage to look even more dated and tacky than the Moore movies made around the same time.  There's a \\"tense\\" video game face-off with the villain that was probably dated when the film first screened and is ridiculous now.  (There's also a terrible 80s era VH1 theme.)  The film meanders on to a forgettable conclusion, especially when measured against the original film.  The documentaries and director's commentary on the DVD make no bones about the film's flaws. Pity, as Klaus Maria is a really terrific villain and both the ladies are fine as are the witty comic support from Edward Fox and Rowan Atkinson.  For Bond completists, others beware.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I was greatly intrigued when I heard that the fourth Indiana Jones movie was coming out.  I enjoyed all three of the original trilogy films back in the 80s & early 90s, and was hoping they would be able to end the series with a blockbuster story.  Unfortunately, this was just not to be.<br /><br />This IJ movie picks up in 1957 and as such it taps into some of the more noteworthy aspects of that time, such as the Red Scare / McCarthyism and nuclear bomb testing (I never knew that refrigerators provided such protection against nukes!).<br /><br />The central theme of the film, however, revolves around the infamous E.T. incident at Roswell New Mexico that has received so much press the past 60 years.  Like [[ASIN:B00005V9IK Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)]], the story also indulges into the associated mythology of little green men being held at AREA 51.<br /><br />As an adventure film, this is roughly as well done as the first three, albeit with some action sequences which go well beyond the realm of believability.  Harrison Ford is back, Karen Allen reprises her role from [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]] (and she has aged quite well, I might add!) and  Shia LaBeouf is a good young up-and-coming actor.  While the identity of LaBeouf's role is pretty predictable, it is still a worthwhile addition to the IJ storyline.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that I found the plot rather....well....hokey.  Once you get into the \\"This stuff is too advanced to have been crafted by humans.  Must have been aliens!\\" motif, then everything becomes very silly very quickly.  Having occult stuff and Hindu stuff in IJ movies is great fun, but to summon space aliens just isn't very Indy like.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie struck me as a cross between a cross between an IJ movie and [[ASIN:B000VECAD0 Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition)]].  While I enjoy both the adventure movie & science fiction genres, it's just not a good thing to try & combine the two (in my opinion, at least).  It's kind of like putting ketchup on your ice cream;  you may enjoy both, but.....s just not a good thing to try & combine the two (in my opinion, at least).

6305882592|5.0|A genuinely quirky movie that turned me into a Cat Stevens fan. I wish they had had dvd's, or even vcr's when this first came out because it would have saved me a lot of money going to the movies to see it over and over.  To describe it as a love story between two necrophiliacs with an extreme age difference does not do it justice.  The sight gags are hilarious.  Christina Pickles creates an unforgettable character as the aristocratic mother of a weird son who is determined to make him into something.

My biology professor explained that the \\"science\\" in these episodes was inspired by current scientific hypotheses and experiments.

They are Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, and now Up    In Finding Nemo, When Harold first lost his son, blinded and disoriented, Chasing Frantically after the Boat, I was there, Right there with him, I could feel his panic and loss.    In The Incredibles, When the missiles are headed for the Plane and Helen (Elastigirl) Is Pleading with the tower \\"Abort! Abort! Abort!\\" even after having seen it a hundred times I still find myself gripping the arms of my chair.    And In Up..... I Don't want to give it away for those who have not seen it. But the first act left me in tears. I am a Grown Man and it left me in tears. That is not something I admit to lightly, and it would be embarrassing if the film had not been so beautifully done.     I Truly Cannot Think of Praise High Enough to give this Film.
159448385X|4.0|While 'The Kite Runner' dealt with the friendship between 2 boys, this novel examines the more complex bond between 2 women who are thrown together in an abusive household.     Mariam and Laila start off as enemies, then develop an uneasy alliance, and this eventually transforms into a symbiotic mother-daughter relationship. Through this duo, Hosseini examines the subjugation of women against the backdrop of Afghanistan's checkered history of Russian conquest and Taleban rule over 30 years.    What's deeply moving and relentlessly compelling about this tale told through 2 interwoven narratives, is the way the author takes the time to flesh out these two women's characters. Mariam, especially, stays in this reader's consciousness for a long time after the story ends.     We live through their horrors as if we are there and flinch each time an act of cruelty or violence is meted out. We also rejoice with them when they survive a difficult patch and wait with bated breath when promise of salvation is close by.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|\\"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.\\" Well, he has. I detected serious illness in Casino Royale, and now he is gone. His replacement is a grim, humorless, unsophisticated thug who should be armed not with a PPK but with a spiked club. He shows no dedication to Queen, country, or right. He is quite repulsive. He goes, not to beautiful, exciting places, but to squalid collections of shacks and featureless deserts (which is a good place for him, I admit). His adversary is about as interesting as a bowl of porridge.  Ah, well. We have The Twenty (or 21, if you, like me, rather like NSNA). Farewell, James. A pity that the tiny hands of Cubby's successors could not hold your greatness, nor their tiny minds appreciate what made you great.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|After sitting through the truly horrible, screeching, incomprehensible mess known as \\"Terminator Salvation\\" last night, I came straight home and put in this fabulous, never boring masterpiece and wondered anew at how it holds up after nearly 30 years. while this latest sequel fails on almost every level, the original continues to thrill, delight and fascinate. The story itself is masterful: it's basically that of an evil force that comes to destroy good until the person is rescued by a hero. Linda Hamilton is fantastic and she'll always be known as the original Sarah Connor.<br /><br />The others are equally dynamic but its the brilliant way that director James Cameron keeps his story simple, uncluttered and just delivers a breathless race of hero and heroine trying to escape an unstoppable evil. The musical score by Brad Fiedel adds immensely to the power of the film. The final sequence of Sarah Connor riding off toward a horion filled with storm clouds gives this masterpiece the perfect ending.<br /><br />You sense that she knows the battle she faces and that she'll survive.<br /><br />The tragedy of all great franchises is that no sequel or prequel can ever measure up to the original that inspired the spin-offs.  After this latest sequel nightmare--\\"Terminator Salvation\\"--audiences like me will return to the original to be really entertained and thrilled. But leave it to the moneymen--they'll keep remaking and giving us sequels and prequels until the last drop is squeezed dry.<br /><br />At least we'll always have James Cameron, Arnold, Linda and Michael Biehn to keep showing us what a true masterpiece is.

B001FB55HG|2.0|The real tragedy of franchise movies is that everyone will always compare the sequels to the original which is usually so brilliant that that's why it becomes a franchise.  I could hardly wait to see what's been done with the Terminator character and its story line. Sadly, this movie was such a shrieking, ear-drum busting mess I tuned out with the first thirty minuts.<br /><br />Christian Bale proves that not even his star power can salvage his title character. The only performer who made everyone perk up was Sam Worthington. Wow, this guy has made it to the big time. He's tough, cute, charaismatic, quiet and exudes star attitude. This should end the franchise but that's Hollywood for you. They'll squeeze yet another sequel from this one until there'll be no one coming to see it anymore.

1593080492|5.0|As always, Jane Austen has an extremely soothing writing style. Sense and Sensibility describes the trials and tribulations of the young Dashwoods who strive to keep their senses about them despite the dramatic flurry of relationships. There are a number of wonderfully entertaining characters, including Ms. Jennings with her loud squawking and gossiping, as well as the Steeles. And, of course, she neatly wraps up the ending as always.<br /><br />Jane Austen is simply brilliant in conveying the idea that indeed, sense and sensibility may not always guarantee happiness and certainly, neither can money and matches of material gain. More was gained than was lost- both knowledge and true happiness were the result of simply answering to the heart and not to the powers that be who called for marriage on the basis of dowry. The Dashwoods, for all their gentleness, sincerity, and society, certainly deserve all of the contentment and satisfaction which can be afforded to them.<br /><br />Anyone who is looking for a cozy book and craving some entertainment and emotional support from a relationship- this is the book for you!

0307266303|5.0|The reviewer who signs himself D. Sull has hit the nail on the head on all fronts.  I agree 100% with the major points in his review.  I purchased this book because I had heard the author speaking about his book on the Bob Edwards Show, on NPR.  It sounded interesting, even though I have never been a runner.  The first two chapters had me wondering if this story was \\"for real\\" or if it was just a hoax as the author describes his travels through the jungle.  After that, however, I couldn't put the book down as I read about the various ultra runners, the author's discourse on why expensive running shoes cause injuries, the nutrition advice from all parties mentioned in this book, the anecdotes about the various tribes and tribe members involved in ultrarunning, the stories about the wonderful people who supported these runners and the author's premise that we are all \\"born to run\\".   READ D. Sull's REVIEW.  I babble on and on; whereas, he has described the book, the stories and the underlying major themes in an exceptionally articulate and professional manner.
0380725398|3.0|Since I loved Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel, I thought I would give Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn a try.  The writing is wonderful but the story not so much. I kept waiting for Mary Yellan to get her poor aunt out of Jamaica Inn and head for a better life somewhere else.  However, this was not to be.    The characters seemed to be almost caricatures for me and I figured out fairly quickly who the man was behind all the evil.  I also could not relate to the ending since Mary Yellan talked about living a life like a man and farming on her own.     This is not my favorite Du Maurier novel.

0743298039|5.0|Diane Setterfield weaves the story of Vida Winter's past seamlessly into the story of Margaret Lea's present. Both stories are utterly captivating. The scenery is so vivid and the characters so alive that the reader feels like part of the story. The plot is unique and fascinating, taking the reader through many twists and turns. This is truly a book one can get lost in. The story comes full circle and the ending is complete, yet I was disappointed to see the story come to an end. I so enjoyed my time spent inside these pages.    This is a novel obviously written by a true book lover. Much of the action takes place either in past or present libraries. And the author refers to many classic books, especially Jane Eyre. Throughout the book the author uses many reading metaphors to relate to everyday life. At one point Margaret is having trouble concentrating and the author relates this to being unable to close your mind on your previous book. She state that this is as leaving a book \\"with ideas and themes - characters even- caught in the fibers of your clothes and when you open the new book, they are still with you.\\" This is the exact sensation I have after closing the cover on this novel.

B001U0HBPG|1.0|I was prepared to really enjoy this film, but, sad to say, it never really clicked for me.  I suppose that one has to admire the special effect, but mostly this film turned me off in almost every way. Interesting musical score.
B001FB55H6|3.0|First off: I am a big fan of Alan Moore's WATCHMEN comic. It's the War And Peace of the graphic medium; broad in scope, meticulously executed, and brimming with interesting ideas. Moore and artist Dave Gibbons' concept, to place superheroes into the `real' world, proved a brilliant one.  The characters, both shaped by and shaping the universe they inhabit, turn out to be mostly un-heroic misfits and borderline lunatics. Yet Moore's ability to identify with even the most extreme of these strange people, gave the work a great deal of heart and emotional impact. Watchmen was also filled with scientific, political, and moral dilemmas, allowing Moore a platform to cleverly integrate his Anarchist philosophy within a meditation on the American mythology as expressed in the `superhero\\".  It was Moore's critique on America.  And though much of its moral relativism and Cold War angst have aged poorly, the Watchmen exploded the expectations the public had for what comic books can be.  Released in `86, the book's challenging and extremely adult themes changed the perception of the entire art form and, by default, opened the door for a more serious approach to comic books on film.<br /><br />Zack Snyder deserves a huge amount of credit for faithfully transplanting much of Moore's novel to the screen. Deemed \\"un-filmable\\" for many years, Snyder rode his 300 success and delivered a film that proved to be un-mountable for several talented directors including Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass.  Snyder's approach here was to simply treat the graphic novel as a sort of rough storyboards for the film. He hits most of the novel's most important ideas and plot points, expands the action and removes the side characters and background materials. It's a Cliff Notes approach, but it does manage to compress the book's expansive ideas into a fairly tight 190-minute film.  This is an accomplishment that must be acknowledged and applauded.<br /><br />The film itself is more problematic. When I heard of its green light a couple of years ago, I questioned the relevance of WATCHMEN in this time. Will its Cold War era themes have any meaning? More importantly, will it's very concept hold any value in a marketplace that's already seen The Incredibles, X-Men, Dark Knight and Heroes? The ideas pioneered by The Watchmen have been plundered for more than 20 years now, and this fact remains an obstacle that Zack Snyder never completely overcomes.<br /><br />WATCHMEN, like the graphic novel, begins with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a brutal Government lackey whose own super brand of cynicism replaced every iota of heroism he may have ever possessed. His death sets Rorschach (Jackie Early Haley), a right-wing moralist vigilante and the movie's de facto protagonist, on a mission to uncover a vast conspiracy to kill off superheroes. He's aided by the meek Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) and the very hot Silk Spectre 2 (Malin Akerman). Then there's Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a nuclear scientist who's been transformed into an omnipotent being and used by the U.S. to win Vietnam and keep the Russkies in check. Finally there's, Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), a wealthy industrialist whose monstrous altruism becomes the film's main moral dilemma. It's all beautifully realized, action packed, set to an occasionally inspired, but often clich&eacute;d soundtrack, and confidently constructed. The dialogue is stiff, but the acting is descent; despite the reviews, I liked both Akerman and Goode. Billy Crudup's approach to Manhattan is both interesting and grounded. The film's star however, is clearly Jackie Earle Haley. His Rorschach (85% of which is behind a full mask) just crackles with energy and wit. Like a coiled spring, Haley gives this extremely unsympathetic character a charisma and depth that countinually thrilled and surprised me. It's a great little performance and I'm interested in seeing a lot more from this former former child star.<br /><br />Everything else in WATCHMEN is uneven. I found myself alternately repulsed, thrilled, disappointed and entertained. I was never bored, but the film failed to impress me as a complete artwork. Like a roller coaster ride, it continually fluctuated between the highs and the lows; never really finding the footing to support its intellectual content. And, much like Dr. Manhattan, I found myself emotionally uninvolved; detached from what was happening before me.  Maybe it was the fact that I had recently re-read the novel and its ideas were not surprising to me anymore. Or maybe it was the fact that when he removed the Moore's details and multiple side characters, Snyder also removed much of what made Watchmen special in the first place.  He removed the novel's soul.found myself alternately repulsed, thrilled, disappointed and entertained. I was never bored, but the film failed to impress me as a complete artwork.

0307266303|5.0|Bottom line up front...if you are bothering to read this review, you should absolutely read the book.  Like many of the reviewers of this book, I read it from cover-to-cover non-stop.      It always bums me out to see the shelves in bookstores for running books filled with technical books containing detailed plans for optimum training, nutrition, etc...the science of fitness.  What I loved so much about this book is that it was much more about the joy of running...just for the pure joy of it...not to lower your PR or beat someone else.  I suspect that after reading this book, most readers, and surely myself, will go out for a run without caring about how fast or far they go.    One last comment: If I didn't know that this was written by Christopher McDougall, I would have guessed it was written by Jimmy Buffet.  The characters in the book are real, but they are larger than life, and you can't help but love them all.      Best book I've read, in any genre, in as long as I can remember.  Don't miss it!

0307269191|4.0|This book is part personal diary, part biography, and part meditation on running. I have not read Murakami Haruki's other works, although they are on my wishlist, and came to this book while exploring the literature on running as a sport and a recreational activity. If you are exploring running as a sport, this book is more contemplative than instructional and I would recommend you take a look at \\"Born to Run\\", or \\"Confessions of Ultramathon Man\\" instead. Having said that, if you have an interest in writing, or enjoyed Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" and have an interest in running, this is definitely a great read - you'll learn about the life and habits of Murakami, as well as get to enjoy a great story along the way.

055380684X|5.0|A great read on motivation, talent and skill building. Coyle's \\"Talent Code\\" is a great complimentary read to \\"Art of Possibility\\" by Benjamin Zander and \\"Outliers\\" by Malcolm Gladwell, both of whom highlight the same patterns: 10,000 hours of practice for \\"world-class performance\\", focus on the struggle not praise, and skill building as confidence building.<br /><br />While Zander provides a great exploration of skill-building as a continuous struggle (and how to motivate people to go on), and Gladwell provides an interesting discussion of nature vs. nurture, Coyle fills in an important gap: how do the talent hot-beds come to be, what are the common attributes, and is it a repeatable process? Author's discussions on \\"ignition\\" and analysis of multiple renowned coaches and techniques are definitely not conclusive, but provide some very instructive insights for fine-tuning our educational system and approaches. Great read!
0374530718|5.0|Wonderfully creative and easy to understand introduction to philosophy.   Just as strong however, is the historical time line.   I wish it had been around when I was a teen.    Since I never had a philosophy course ( or world history for that matter ), this was a wonderful read for me.   The suspenseful plot makes it a page-turner that one cannot put down.  Thank you, Mr. Gaarder!  P.S. Now almost 20 years after the book was written, there is much new scientific awareness, especially in regards to animals' capacity for thought.    Some of the text might need to be changed if re-written today.
0385247125|4.0|This is a fun read, from Michael, himself.  The only qualms I have with it were a few editing glitches (which surprised me, because it was edited by Jackie O.)...  These made some of the time-lines confusing, where Michael was jumping back and forth describing his career.  There is a definite break once he talks about venturing into a solo career.  The book takes on a different feeling, much of it having to do with Michael's sense of responsibility to his family, and being lost to his own personal needs (whatever those are).  Michael was very inhibited when it came to girls, and still a virgin, as far as I can tell, into his 20's.<br /><br />Also, many of the photographs weren't labeled.  Some of the photos of \\"famous\\" people I barely recognized, only because I grew up with Michael Jackson.  Others, I wish had been labeled with the names of his brothers, so I could tell who they all were.  They were all intensely handsome young men!<br /><br />But this is a book about Michael.  As I got deeper into it, I was beginning to feel that Michael was seeing himself not just as the King of Pop, but the King of the Universe.  No wonder he is so lonely!  On that note, Michael stays on the surface with the events of his childhood and career, not really getting too heavily into describing his deeper feelings at all.  So the intense focus on \\"self\\" seems to show how much of Michael's life has been a process of privilege and entitlement, simply due to his talent and willingness to perform from the age of 5.  And this was very sad to me.<br /><br />At the end of the book Michael states he wants very much to get at the truth of himself, and to share that truth with his fans.  I didn't feel him succeed.  From the time he was a little kid, Michael was coached by his dad and by managers to keep quiet about a lot of things. Blanketing the truth, withholding information from people (like your mother) and keeping silent about what happens on the road are the prices to be paid when you're a child star.  You are rewarded and hurt at the same time,  You begin to think that this is a normal lifestyle in order to achieve fame.  These are the \\"truths\\" I got from reading Michael's book.<br /><br />For the full truth on Michael, we have to go to other books about him to learn.  From this one, you'll learn that Michael has always been a passionate performer; he has a great sense of fun and compassion; he loves to study other people who are like this; he loves animals and kids.  Yes, he talks about his surgeries and decision to be a vegetarian, so he could watch his weight and feel great, looking as dynamic as he did when this book was written at the age of 29.  Michael loves Mexican food.  Those were some great tips for my own vegetarian diet, too!<br /><br />I wish him happiness and have a respectful appreciation of this gifted guy, whose albums I will always listen to, and who, in my mind, will always be the King of Pop.<br /><br />Thank you for all the years of music, fun and dancing you have shared with us, Michael.

B000127LW2|5.0|Great movies on the DVD. Captain Janeway's  character  is remarkable as compared to  the first selected French actress. The short  clip on the original Captain was very informative  and very interesting.  Since watching Season 1, I have now bought  Voyager - Season 2. Each month, I will purchase  a new season (DVd) of Star Trek Voyager.

B000ZOXDFA|1.0|If you're not familiar with real history ,like the majority of people are, then this movie would seem like a very entertaning one. On the other hand if you know a bit about history you would realize that this movie is so innacurate that at times it seems like a fantasy. Also they portray the spaniards looking like if they were from some South American country(no disrespect)and all of them dress in black to make them look like the bad guys, prince Phillip II is portrayed like a limping weirdo completely out of touch with reality. I just wish Hollywood would make a real good movie about this subject without taking sides and portraying both the English and the Spaniards as accurate as possible the way they really were along with the real reasons why the armada campaign came to be.......The real reason for the Spanish Armada wasntareligious e, it was a response from the Spanish to the continous piratical attacks to spanish possessions from english buccaneers backed by Queen Elizabeth.
B001KK052W|5.0|Some of the episodes are hysterical...some just so so but overall, if you are a fan it is a great thing to have.  There seems to be a quality issue.  The first set I received was missing a dvd in the second year.  Got a replacement set and it was missing some of the literature so I had to mix and match to get a full set.  Unusual problem.  When you receive your set I suggest you open the whole thing right away to be sure you have everything.
0142000671|4.0|In the land of opportunity, everyone strives to achieve the ultimate goal: to live the American dream. Of Mice and Men's protagonists George Milton and Lennie Small are no different. John Steinbeck gives his readers the reality of the road to the American dream.   George and Lennie dream of owning their own farm and being their own bosses, but they need to work for the money to buy land first. While working on a ranch, they encounter troubles with the boss' son, Curley, a hot-headed and aggressive man. These troubles climax with Lennie's accident and merciful end.   One of the greatest elements of Steinbeck's novel is his character Lennie Small. Slightly mentally disabled, Lennie is a large but kind-hearted man with the mannerisms of a child. His unshakable, child-like faith in one day owning a farm is the drive of his and George's hard-work.  Personally, he is one of the only characters who can provoke emotion from the reader, whether it is pity from Lennie being scolded by George and bullied by Curley, or utter sorrow from the final events of the novel.   Steinbeck accomplishes to tell the \\"other story\\" of pursuing the American dream. Unlike many stories where there are happy endings, Of Mice and Men incorporates some harsh realities of making it big in the land of opportunity. The obstacles that George and Lennie face on the ranch and the heartbreaking ending definitely illustrate such realities.   Despite the novel's ending, Of Mice and Men is a great book to read. I would personally recommend readers of high school age or above to read this great tale of two men and their struggles to success.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Thank goodness my boss told me about this show right before the 2nd season began.  Now I've ordered the 1st season to see how it all started.  This is, by far, the best series I've ever watched.  It's funny, scary, thought provoking & has some of the best acting I've ever seen.  You care about the main characters & what's happening to them, even though sometimes they make you cringe.  You can count on at least 2 or 3 shocking moments & twists & turns in every episode.  Love it love it & highly recommend it!
B000002UAF|5.0|THIS IS TRULY A REMARKABLE ALBUM. IT CAPTURES THE EXCITEMENT OF BEATLEMANIA. FROM THE FIRST SONG \\"A HARD DAYS NIGHT\\" IT GRABS YOU AND DOES NOT RELEASE YOU. ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE RIVETING AND SOOTHING! THE HARMONY BETWEEN JOHN AND PAUL IN \\"IF I FELL\\" ARE GREAT! JOHN'S HARMONICA ON \\"I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER\\"IS QUITE GOOD,DOING DYLAN IN A ROCKISH MODE. PAUL BEING SPANISH IN \\"AND I LOVE HER\\". ALL THE SONGS ARE VERY GOOD. ANY YOUNG PERSON WANTING TO KNOW WHAT BEATLEMANIA WAS AND IS, SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS GREAT ALBUM. STILL ONE OF MY FAVOURITES. BEATLEMANIA CAPTURED IN TIME FOREVER!!!!!!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|What if in the course of an 80 year life span, you meet the love of your life while you're aging forward and they're aging backward?  What if you first meet when you're 10 and they're 70, then you're in your early 20s and they're in their mid 50s?  What if you meet in the middle in your 40s?  And then you're in your 60s and they're in their 20s?  What if you have a child together?  How do you both prepare for and handle the future, knowing you will grow old, and they will become a teenager, adolescent, child, toddler and infant?      This is a well-acted modern adaptation of an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story concept, spanning World War I to 2005 (Hurricane Katrina.)  I didn't realize Brad Pitt could act, but he did an amazing job of playing an old person to a teenager.  Ditto for Cate Blanchett and other actors, who also did a wonderful job across the ages from young to old.  The acting and makeup made this believable.  Ditto for the cinematography, depicting far flung locations and different time periods.  It's an original movie plot that makes you think.  FWIW, this movie made me cry more than any movie I've ever watched.
B001FB55HG|5.0|A+++++++    They capture the tone of the flashback/forwards from T1 perfectly and bring the story that's been waiting (what, thirty years now?) to be told to life.     Makes up for T3 and that Sarah Connor Chronicles crap a million times over.
B001SMC91M|2.0|I bet these guys put on a great live show, but this CD failed to thrill me. Black Joe Lewis is being hyped as a soul shouter in the tradition of Otis Redding or James Brown. Joe's a shouter all right, but with limited range and emotion. On some songs it sounds like he's shouting the same note over and over, with no soul, no melody whatsoever. Although the band is tight, this is a weak attempt at a retro-Stax sound that doesn't work for me.    If you're looking for new artist doing some old school soul (albeit in a Motown vein), check out Raphael Saadiq's \\"The Way I See It\\"- 5 stars! One of my fave CD's of 2008!
B00007JVBI|5.0|A really great collection of the song that Cat Power creates - maybe her best!
006074748X|3.0|Vanessa March is angry with her husband Lewis.  He had promised her a holiday through Europe.  But then, as she was getting ready, he drops a bomb: he has to fly alone to Stockholm for business.  Alone in London, she visits an obnoxious \\"friend.\\"  This friend has a seventeen-year-old son who wants to see his father in Vienna.  Could Vanessa fly with Tim to Vienna?  Of course not!  But then Vanessa spots Lewis on a newsreel.  There had been a fire in a caravan at a traveling circus near Vienna of all places, and Tim was there among the shocked spectators.  But that's not all.  A beautiful blonde was with him.  Well...  what do you think she does next?  With a backdrop of the Austrian alps, beautiful performing horses, government espionage, and gothic and magic atmosphere, Vanessa and Tim uncover shocking things about her husband, the traveling circus and a celebrity horse whose \\"Airs Above the Ground\\" performance is legendary, as well as the circumstances that bring him to the circus...<br /><br />I hate to be one of the people to burst the five-star review bubble.  Airs Above the Ground isn't terrible, but it isn't the best effort either.  Granted, there are some impressive twists and turns, especially the one about halfway through the story and, of course, the ending.  But the novel is somewhat boring for the most part and the author takes too long to draw her conclusions.  I do like the way Tim describes the different kinds of horses and the backdrop of Austria gives the novel a beautiful and eery atmosphere.  Mary Stewart has written some great books.  I loved Nine Coaches Waiting and was crazy about The Ivy Tree and Madam, Will You Talk?  This one, however, is middling at best.  Still, it is better than most if not all romantic suspense novels written today.  Romantic suspense penned by the likes of Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught lack originality and seem to be targeted to people with a fourth grade reading level.  As for this one, it could be a hit or a miss.  It's up to you to decide which one it is.  But to me, it's kind of a tossup..  It's up to you to decide which one it is.

6305922756|5.0|THIS IS SPINAL TAP has to be one of if not the funniest parody movies ever made.  Heavy metal music (especially when its performers and fans take it too seriously) is inherent with ridiculous elements that seem made to be spoofed.  Director Rob Reiner (who appears in the film as documentary maker Marty) and actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer playing the three lead musicians in Spinal Tap capitalize on the silliness and take it to outrageous and hilarious lengths with their pitch perfect deadpan deliveries.  Packed with funny one liners  this film can be watched multiple times without losing enjoyment.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|The most addicting TV show is a long time!  I won't go into too much detail as so many other folks have already done so.  But who would have thought a show involving the romance of a plucky young southern waitress and a vampire would actually keep me glued to the set for an entire week?   The combination of Alan Ball and Charlaine Harris provides one wild, unpredictable, although ultimately exhausting trip that includes just about everything but the kitchen sink--virgins, romance, vampires, serial killers, shapeshifters, rednecks, goths, sex and more sex, drugs, exorcisms, fangbangers, fundamentalist, etc.    Yes it does go beyond what the book depicted, but heck it's if you can't bear to see any changes from the books then just stick to them and don't bother with the show!  Personally I think it does a great job in keeping with the plot line of the original, and any addition in the end complement rather than hurt the story (enhancing Tara's and Lafeyette's roles, and bringing in new ones, Jessica and Amy).    There was so much going in the entire first season that it was not surprising that it started to lose steam at the end during the last two episodes.  However that was a very minor point considering the superiority of the previous episodes, and in general the quality of the writing and direction was consistently inspired and unflagging in its pacing.  And of course the actors, all too numerous to mention, never struck any false notes: Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer, Rutana Wesley, Nelson Ellis, Ryan Kwanten, Sam Trammell, Lois Smith, Lizzy Caplan, Adina Porter, etc.    However an advisory also needs to be stated that this is not a kids' show by any means with its sexual content, nudity, mature themes, drug use, foul language, and all round gleeful vulgarity.  And especially not for the easily offended!  Furthermore those expecting absolute fidelity to the original or those unable to keep suspension of disbelief please stay far away from this series.  But for the rest of us, here is something wildly imaginative and inventive show that has something for everyone.

059305704X|4.0|Another very enjoyable Jack Reacher novel. There's a bit of a difference in this one. The killing machine appears mush more subtle than in his previous roles. Is Jack becoming mellow? Nope, he's back in form toward the end. This book seems to have a bit more suspense than blood & guts throughout most of the story. It's well worth your time.<br />Don't be fooled by some of the very low ratings this book has gotten. Many were written about the Kindle price; not the book<br /><br />Now, for you Kindle folks. The review should be about the book rather than your experience with Amazon
0374139563|5.0|Dambisa Moyo's text provides a well-reasoned argument that many decades of development aid targeted at African governments have failed to meet their stated goals, and have actually been counterproductive.  She outlines an alternative approach based on debt capital markets and trade which is sure to yield much better results.  This book is a must-read for any policymaker, philanthropist, or development functionary who truly wants to see the African masses lifted out of poverty.  It was truly a delight to view this issue through the lens of Dambisa's personal experience.  I hope she continues to be successful in getting her message out.
055358894X|2.0|I started this thinking this would be a grand fantasy read, but the fantasy elements in this one are rather light. That's okay, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the rest of the book made up for the fantasy-lite experiences. However, the book starts off rather slow. It's a long while before it picks up as the author lays out the elaborate \\"scheme\\" the characters are involved in. Those were some of the slowest parts. It did pick up in parts of the book and there were so geniune good moments, but in the balance of things, not enough. Also, I'm no prude. I swear myself on occassion, but the characters swear nearly every time they speak, high class, low class, middle class, they all do and for not reason. I swear when I'm mad or tense. The characters in this swear for no reason at all except that the author seems to think it's cool. On the plus, and the reason for 2 stars, is some of the action scenes were pretty good, but they were far apart and few.

B000000WA4|5.0|I have listened to this album more often than any others. Which means hundreds of time. I first got introduced to Smashng Pumpkins when I was a teen. This is because of the huge impact their video clip Bullet With Butterfly Wings had during Woodstock '94. At first I thought Billy Corgan's voice was horrible. But I got used to it. From then on I have collected every Smashing Pumpkins album until Adore came out. In fact, Adore was very different from their previous work. And I momently stopped being a Smashing Pumpkins fan. Unfortunately, I think they never recaptured the essence of Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness since.    Mellon Collie is for me the most alternated album of all time. It goes from piano to very heavy guitar with Billy Corgan's voice screaming like hell. Every song is unique. There are 5 singles on this double album: Tonight Tonight, Zero, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Thirty-Three and 1979. A total of 28 songs. This album is for me a masterpiece and the greatest of the Smashing Pumpkins. I strongly recommend if you like alternative rock.
0375826726|2.0|pon·der·ous<br />1 : of very great weight<br />2 : unwieldy or clumsy because of weight and size<br />3 : oppressively or unpleasantly dull : lifeless<br />(Webster)<br /><br />I was disappointed with this from the very first page. I only finished reading it because I enjoyed the first two and now I'm committed to knowing the rest of the plot! (I tried to just read the Wikipedia summary but it didn't make sense to me.) My issues with this book are:<br /><br />1) The length is not justified. There are way too many minute details. Many things are detailed that should have been ignored, and vice versa. It could have been MUCH shorter, or the same length with meatier content. That's ironic considering it was meant to be the last book but Paolini decided the story had to be split because it couldn't be told in one book... I would beg to differ!<br /><br />My guess is that he got so caught up in the success of his creation that he thought everyone would want to read about every little detail of every character and object and interaction in his world, and he just got swept away in the excitement of it all and didn't know when to stop... and unfortunately neither did his editor.<br /><br />2) The writing is worse than the first two books. The way everyone talks (and talks, and talks) is unrealistic and stilted. The dialog is too formal, yet the storytelling is the opposite: too lowbrow, and very rarely poetic or elegant. It's almost like you're reading a plumbing manual in pseudo-Olde English... except that the grammar is bad too. I kept finding myself having to mentally correct the frequent errors in speech. He needs to learn to use prepositions and 'whom' correctly. And he definitely needs a better editor!<br /><br />3) The characters are flat and lifeless. They pontificate and philosophize and have zero personality. Instead of being at the heart of the story, they are now just afterthoughts. It's like the 3D world we entered in the first book has suddenly become 2D. No spunk, no zest, no fire... another irony since \\"Brisingr\\" means fire.<br /><br />4) GOBS of pages are devoted to ethics, religion and politics. Sir, you are in your 20s. You are a fantasy author. Your success at a young age does not give you some special authority on these matters. Please, spare us.<br /><br />5) There are many unnecessary and way-too-detailed descriptions of gore. I didn't realize that this series is specifically directed at young adults until reading some of the reviews just now, and well, now I'm VERY shocked at the gore.<br /><br />6) There are many parts that read like they could be describing a sexual encounter even though they had nothing to do with sex. My husband commented that maybe Paolini needs to, um, get it out of his system or something, so his writing doesn't read like a romance novel. It was really weird and we couldn't help laughing at this on almost every page.<br /><br />7) Tons of things are just unrealistic, even for a fantasy story. There are too many to try to go into detail!<br /><br />The one thing I felt was an improvement over the last two books is that Eragon is no longer constantly being chastised by everyone around him (including himself). He seems to actually have earned some respect and gained some self-esteem. But now I wonder... does he deserve it??<br /><br />UPDATE: I recently read book 4 and I'm so glad I did. It is the best book of the whole series. AND it starts out with a summary of books 1-3.

B0000CAXID|5.0|I like alternative rock. For me, what makes a 5 star album is the quality of the singles. It's all about music and I don't listen much to lyrics. Like Kurt Cobain once said: \\"music first, lyrics second\\". And I totally agree with the quote.     The album begins with 3 solid singles, for a total of 12 great songs. I find every of its songs catchy. It alternates very well, from soft to more grungy. I think this Foo Fighters album is excellent and among the 90's greatest.    I could hardly be more pleased. This is one of my favorite!
B001WCN23W|5.0|Is this one of the greatest albums ever?  Yes, of course it is.  Is it worth buying for the fourth, fifth, whatever time again.  Yeah, if you like feeling cheated.  No extra tracks?  Come on the Stones got a ton of 'em.  What a rip off.  No wonder the music business is going down the drain.  This is just pure greed on the part of the Stones.  If you really want to hear it, not that there is any noticeable difference from the last reissue, download it for free.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|One of the most delightful books I have ever read!  It came to me on several levels:  I love to write; I love to read; I love the ocean and British Islands; I love the \\"sprite\\" character (so like my own daughter) on whom the novel centered; and my father fought in WWII. I knew nothing about what happened in the English Channel, let alone that there were islands captured during the War.<br />That our authoress found such picturesque characters to weave together was charming and so British! I want more books like this!

B000002KEV|5.0|I just picked this up on vinyl again - hadn't listened to it in 20 years. It is still a monumental rock live album. It's heavy and it never lets up...pure rock genius. The album highlights all the creativity and excess of pure rock-n-roll - extended drum solos, wailing guitars, etc. And it all works.    To those who think the drum solos should have been edited out to allow more songs to be included: yes, and if the band had only sung the first verse, imagine how many more songs could have been included. In fact, if they'd played everything like the Minutemen, they could have included their whole catalog. That completely misses the point of the album; cutting the drums or guitars or whatever would ruin it.    So, go buy this now. And turn it up.
0143038583|4.0|What shall we eat? Should we eat chicken once we know how inhumanely chickens are treated on industrial farms? Once you see how animals are killed, slaughtered and eviscerated, do you really want to eat them? If you're hunting for mushrooms, how do you know which ones will agree with you and which ones are poisonous? Should we eat only humanely treated animals off the farm? Should we eat processed foods loaded with chemicals made with corn syrup, corn starch, or glucose and fructoses derived from the inside of the corn cob and now mixed with chemicals?<br /><br />This is the omnivore's dilemma. Michael Pollan spends time on an industrial corn farm in Iowa, watching corn get harvested and sent to a feed mill, which is then purchased by cattle farmers, who then get fat on the corn (even though they are gastronomically designed to eat pasture, not corn). The cows are purchased, then taken to an industrial plant where they are slaughtered, and after a while, the cow becomes ingredients in our Big Macs and in our processed foods and in our supermarkets.<br /><br />Pollan then spends a week on Joel Salatin's organic farm where he is duly impressed with the farm's efficiency and better treatment of the animals, though he grimaces at the prospect of butchering chickens.<br /><br />Pollan then goes vegetarian for a while as he considers the arguments of the animal rights groups. Then he goes boar hunting and shoots his own boar and prepares a completely organic meal at the end of the book consisting of food where he does all the hunting and gathering.<br /><br />It's a good book and definitely makes you think about where your food comes from, how it is prepared, and whether or not you really want to eat it.<br /><br />The most amazing thing to me was learning how many of our foods are made from corn. Almost everything either has that nasty no good for you corn syrup or corn starch, or is made up of processed sugars from the cob of the corn.<br /><br />Makes you want to eat veggies and fruits and nothing else.

B001RIY4WE|4.0|I have read several reviews about this movie not working on some BD players.  I can speak from experience that on 3 different brands Panasonic Profile 1.1, Sony BDP-S350 (you need to add memory), and Sony BDP-S550 this movie worked great.  Yes on the profile 2.0 it wants to connect to the Internet buy you just hit cancel and it continues to load.    Yes it does take about 40 seconds to load but the sound and picture are awesome!!    I do feel they could have made the menu easier to navigate.  It takes time to cycle through all the scenes if you want to jump to your favorite part.  This is a definite buy for your growing BD collection.

0307386171|4.0|Ian McEwan has a way about taking a heightened sexual moment and writing a story about how it forever affects the people's lives of those involved. In this book, he writes about a wedding night whose honeymoon is taking place on Chesil Beach. From this night, he projects forward and backward revealing the spouse's lives before they met, their courtship, and the fate that is to befall both of them. Perhaps you find yourself reading these digressions to learn whether their first time in bed together is a success, but you end up with a deeper, poignant understanding of the events that transpire.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As one of the masses of Americans without quality healthcare insurance, watching this film really struck a cord. Despite being a progressive, something about Moore hadn't previously really shaken me--until now.<br /><br />The depths which people go to merely to take care of ourselves would be amusing in an action adventure movie. But this is basic sustenance in what is supposed to be an affluent first world democracy. Scavenging for our sustenance is time-consuming. This concept also degrades the very notion that America is prosperous and the present model of healthcare successfully works.<br /><br />With emphasis currently being spent on rewarding the industry fat cats rather than practicing preventative medicine, American health care is poorly managed when compated against other western democracies. The individual testimonies throughout this film are heartbreaking  And they would not have had to make these journies in a universal health care system.

B00006CXSS|5.0|If Steven Spielberg is associated with a movie or tv series what else is expected? Just top notch direction, production, and of course the right actors. I have enjoyed all of his movies, Saving Private Ryan, Munich and Schindler's List to name a few. However, Band of Brothers was an unexpected surprise. I was unaware of Easy Company and their heroic achievements. Only a true genious of Spielberg's caliber could bring this to life.

0307278255|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri is my most favorite author. Words spill onto her page with such elegance. This book is divided into two halves, one which contains a collection of short stories and a second which develops the story of two of the characters written about in a short story. It's an odd format. Lahiri's writing is so good and anticipated she could write on a cocktail napkin and I'd read it. Apparently, others feel the same way. In this book, Lahiri once again explores the theme of Indians becoming Americanized generation by generation. Like all immigrants their lives dilute into the American mainstream and the traditions of food, family, and dress are left behind. One wonders whether life in America brought the happiness sought by those who migrated or, referencing the book's title and the quote from which it is taken, whether our roots do grow stronger in unaccostomed earth.

1595141715|5.0|It took me just a few short days to read this book. Let me start off by saying I have had someone close in my family commit suicide and I have before that happened wanted and tried to commit suicide as well. This book is NOT a step-by-step way for a teenage to commit suicide. If they wanted to do that there are websites that give you tons of ideas so do not try and point blame at this author, that is just a way to help you in not blaming yourself if you failed to see the signs in someone else. Now onto the book, it is beautiful and heart wrenching. I cried hearing Hannah tell all these people the reasons that lead her to do this. The fact that you get so much background information about Clay from himself and you are lingering waiting to find out how he plays a role in this is enough to keep you up past your bed time. It also shows teens that there are many options you have in different situations and points out the ones that should be taken. A beautiful read and will change your way of viewing on some people you interact with, and may have you take your chance that you still have.

B000E1JOSE|5.0|I bought this CD for a friend of mine who happens to be blind.  I did so after seeing the stage set of Black and White Night on PBS and telling Mike about the great show.  He wished he had been able to have caught it as he too is a musician and quite the vocalist in his own right.  Orbison is one of his favorites.  I figured the CD would be as valuable to him as the DVD, and less expensive for myself, he has thanked me many times for the gift.    If you love Roy, seeing all his friends willing to play \\"second fiddle\\" to him and work back-up is amazing.  Well worth the money.    Clint Wigen.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I could not wait to receive this and I subscribed to HBO just so I could watch the second season.

I am so ready for the 2nd season to start.
B001TOD92C|4.0|I've always thought Mickey Rourke was a great actor, from \\"Body Heat\\" and \\"The Pope of Greenwich Village\\" to the little known \\"Homeboy\\". Rourke has been great at recreating the role of the struggling loser or the the cool criminal. Unlike most Hollywooders who may have seen a boxing ring or heavy bag as a fitness trend, Mickey Rourke had roots in the sport since a young age, and it shows in the way he moves and acts. Not a phony tough guy at all.  I think this screenplay was based on Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, a wrestler who fell from huge popularity and sold out mega-arenas to barnstorming the VFW circuit for a hundred a night or so. The tale of Jake the Snake is documented well in \\"Beyond the Mat\\", a fine documentary and a must for wrestling fans or followers of Americana or just the human condition.    Rourkes \\"Wrestler\\" character is Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a former wrestling superstar reduced 20 years later to living in a trailer, working blue collar during the week and moonlighting the occasional small wrestling promotion. Spent, overweight with a bad heart and bleached hair, Rourke plays has-been to perfection. Every move, every part of his day lives like a punishment for abusing his body and his fame  earlier in life. As \\"The Ram\\" tries to pursue romance with local dancer Tomei and renconciliation with daughter Wood, we bare witness to a pained soul and the public, who however smaller, still wanting what destroyed his health.Interesting is the parralell between Tomei's exploitation of her body and youth as a stripper and what Rourke is going through.    It's a great film, even if I predicted the final shot about 2 minutes out. The script could have used a little work. Not much is done to show how \\"The Ram\\" became a high-profile superstar- he seems to lack any of the charisma that would probably have been needed to reach such a height.  Regardless, it's one of the better films of late and somewhat of an anti-\\"Rocky\\" with it's bleak message.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|The DVD, Playing for Change, is without a doubt one of the best productions of song I've ever experienced!  The variety of talent displayed far exceeds normal listening.  The music itself is inspirational, and lends the listener the oppportunity of hearing it over and over again without being bored or uninterested.  There are no words to express the uniqueness of this particular DVD.
0596522347|5.0|This book explains HOW should you make your presentation in order to get FULL effect and WHY should you make it that way. It explains all the concepts and challenges behind most presentations, the risks and the questions one faces.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book because it explained to me the many mistakes we make and all the preconceptions we have when we think about what a good presentation is.<br /><br />I've been doing presentations for a long time and I am pretty successful with them. But the truth is all I knew before reading this book was based on intuition and some common sense.

0307269752|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first novel in a trilogy written by Stieg Larsson. Unfortunately, the author passed away in 2004 and the public will see no more from this talented author.<br /><br />This novel is part financial intrigue, part family saga, and part murder mystery. The three parts are woven together to form a complex, thinking man's thriller. With the exception of approximately the first fifty pages, providing an inordinate amount of financial jargon and detail, the novel is a page turner. And, most of the remainder of the novel is necessary and adds to the story; however, there were one or two scenes that I could have done without. Not because of their graphic nature - as there is a good deal of that in the novel - but rather because they were not required. Why do so many authors throw in these predictable and highly unnecessary scenes?<br /><br />Although the translation is not seamless, it is not too bad. I enjoyed the touches of Sweedish that pepper the story as it adds to the atmosphere, helping me experience Sweden for myself. The plot was interesting but not really unpredictable for me as I have the tendency to figure out every movie, television show, etc... within the first five minutes. The characters were well developed to the point where you wanted to know what would happen next to them.<br /><br />Let Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo and a genius computer hacker, take you on a journey to solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger, a girl who disappeared  forty years ago.<br /><br />I recommend to those who like mystery/thrillers. I think you will like this novel. I am looking forward to the sequel, The Girl Who Played with Fire.
0743496736|2.0|I was interested in the premise of the book (really, who isn't?), and I started reading without hesitating. But I soon found out that the characters felt too cheap, too shallow, to properly care about. Josie was a shallow and weak girl who wouldn't stand up to her boyfriend because she wanted to be popular. And Peter...am I supposed to feel bad for him? I somewhat understand his bullying situation, but he lost any sympathy from me when he killed his teacher and a retarded girl. How can I feel bad for a guy like that? I would sympathize a little more if it was just the 'populars' he killed, but those two deaths were pointless.     But back to the book itself. At times Picoult's sentences went on and on, trying to strive for some deep metaphor. Eventually I forgot what she was even talking about because it was drowning in metaphors and similes. Sometimes it's better to just get to the point. Overall, I was disappointed in this book and its weak characters. If this was my first Picoult book, I probably wouldn't read any others, but I know she can (and has) done better.
B001P50HOI|4.0|Yes has never needed an orchestra because they've always sounded like an orchestra. When the band was playing at full fury, you'd swear more than five musicians were playing on stage. The Symphonic Live tour incorporated an entire orchestra to accompany Yes, and this CD, from a 2001 show with The European Festival Orchestra conducted by Wilhelm Keitel, offers Yes music, not overwhelmed by the enormity of the symphonic sound, but tinged with the subtle nuance of an appropriate and vital fifth instrument.<br /><br />Where keyboardist Rick Wakeman, replaced on this tour by a very able Tom Brislin from New Jersey, once offered a full-bodied mood to Yessongs suggesting orchestration, the Symphonic Live version's strings swell. Often it comes as no surprise where the depth of the music lies, but just as often, the symphony is an unexpected layer to Yes' complexity, flaring up sometimes fully, sometimes quietly where you'd least expect it. Brass and strings add a dramatic and majestic edge to the chaotic \\"The Gates of Delirium\\"; the orchestra harp lifts \\"And You and I\\" to a swirling luscious glory, and \\"In The Presence Of\\" with it's suite-like progress, reaches cosmic heights only the mystical Yes can conjure.<br /><br />Aging Yes is at the top of their musicianship throughout Symphonic Live, with Steve Howe's funky and bluesy and progressive guitar playing being a constant pleasure. The biggest surprise is the backing vocals from Howe and bassist Chris Squire, which due to better technology have never sounded better live. The only disappointment is \\"Ritual\\", from Tales From Topographic Oceans, which becomes a verbose disjointed all-show, no-soul bombast from bassist Squire. A perfect rendition can be found on YESSHOWS from 1982. The CD packaging on Symphonic Live is limited to just essential information.<br /><br />What a difference a few generations can make. I saw this tour in Albany, New York, and the neatly trimmed manicured rows of attendees sitting like attentive pupils in class, politely watching Yes, were a far cry from the Yes shows I remember in their heyday in the 1970s, when you had to step over half-conscious and overdosed jean clad bodies on the way to your seat in a sports arena serving as a music hall, with enough marijuana smoke in the air to choke a horse. Here at the Symphonic Live show, I lit a cigarette and was swarmed by security who dutifully escorted me like a criminal out the gates to a designated smoking area. There was little chance of lighting up anything else.

0307277453|5.0|I just love this book. Like some of the very best writing, Your Inner Fish showed that human beings are, essentially, fish, but as highly tooled up hot rods (the metaphor belongs to the author). The gills of fish have evolved to become elements of the human larynx. The stapes bone in our inner ear evolved from a much larger bone that forms a large part of the lower jaw of amphibians and reptiles. And these are just two of the many examples presented by Neil Shubin in this very entertaining and informative book.<br />But what I liked most about Your Inner Fish is something implied in the title; YOUR! Indeed it is our very own Inner Fish that is so fascinating. This was not just the emotion laden wishy washy writing of New Age no nothings - this is science in its most dynamic and liberating forms. How wonderful is that? Few venues have the power to awaken our slumbering selves out of our trance as individual, isolated psychological selves, than does science and this book does just that.

B001FBSMF8|3.0|This CD wasn't what I expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.    I ended up giving it a three star rating for two reasons:  (1) Chris Cornell has one of the greatest voices ever; and  (2) I appreciate his sense of adventure in going somewhere that I would have never predicted.    Having said all of this, let me say a few more things:    I like more of the second half of the CD than the songs in the first half. That's probably because they sound more familiar to what I'm used to hearing from Cornell.    Like I mentioned earlier, a sense of adventure is a good thing for artists. I can imagine that it's probably tough to keep on doing the same old thing, and that's why artists (and people in general) change once in a while. I'm not entirely convinced that this works for Cornell. At least some of it doesn't seem to work for me the way that it did when Bob Mould took off for DJ Mix Master Land in the last several years.    Still, it took a while for me to get used to Bob Mould doing his new thing, so hopefully that's the case with Chris Cornell, and maybe I'll warm up to this a lot more later. Right now it's hard to believe that the roads from Soundgarden and Audioslave ended up at some of these songs.

There was even enough room for the neighbors kids, ages 7 and 5, to join in.

0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief, by Rick Riordan, is a beautifully written book that tells the story of a boy named Percy Jackson who is kicked out of boarding school. While he is still in school, strange things start to happen. For instance the math teacher, Mrs. Dodds, appears to have been sent from the underworld by Hades and is trying to bring Percy there.<br /><br />Talk about strange! When summer starts, Percy and his friend Grover board a bus and find that at the station there are three women with yarn. What sends shivers down Percy's back is that the middle lady cut her yarn. What could that mean? After Percy's mother dies, Percy is out on his own at Camp Half Blood where he meets the daughter of Athena. The three pair up and go on a quest to find Zeus' stolen lighting bolt. They are determined to find it.  Read the book and find out what happens!<br /><br />The Lighting Thief is a hilarious, suspenseful book. You'll keep reading it until you turn the last page!

1439138311|1.0|The passive young woman in this story never seems to be able to stand up for herself, nor make a binding decision. What really offends me, though, are two things: first, the author really knows nothing about New York in the 1950s (how could he?)--although he mentions the Dodgers,we never experience anthing at a game other than hot dogs; and although he mentions \\"Singin' In The Rain,\\" that's all he does--mention it a couple of times. The city in the 1950s (I visited there in 1951 at age 17), was vibrant and exciting, and on display, everything was going on. So for me, the dullness of the girl, the oppressive scenery and horrible women who rule her, plus the author's inability to bring any life to the city he has chosen to portray....well, for a truer picture of the New York area and the fifties era read \\"Underworld\\" by Don DeLillo!
0385341008|3.0|No need for a long review here. The line of like or dislike is pretty clear cut. If you watch the Hallmark Channel or love Lifetime, this one's probably for you.

B000002HEP|5.0|Kyuss is probably one of the most fundamental stoner rock groups in existence.  Though they weren't a huge commercial success, their legacy has been sustained well beyond their breakup as one of the best rock bands to have ever come out.  While many will point to [[ASIN:B000001A3H Blues for the Red Sun]] as being their breakout album, this one dared to venture further into the territory the group started to explore on that release and provided the listener with an innovative, imaginative way to capture stoner rock with progressive and psychedelic influences.      You don't see too many albums have three tracks (plus a \\"hidden\\" one) that spans close to 52 minutes, but that's what's going on here.  The first series of tracks focus mostly on driving rock, with \\"Asteroid\\" acting as the calm, instrumental piece to mellow the fire of \\"Gardenia\\" and \\"Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop\\".  \\"100 Degrees\\" continues on with the big rock sound of the first tracks, but then the album goes to the quiet and calm \\"Space Cadet\\" before launching upon the brooding \\"Demon Cleaner\\" (which is a hit of sorts on this album, being featured on the [[ASIN:B001PKHRTQ Guitar Hero Metallica]] video game in addition to being covered live by Tool.)  The album finally winds down with the last suite of tracks, \\"Odyssey\\"/\\"Conan Troutman\\"/\\"N.O.\\"/\\"Whitewater\\", with \\"Whitewater\\" being the quintessential closer for the album.  A little bit of wackiness comes about with \\"Lick Doo\\" but that's kinda normal considering Homme's other works.    Chalk this one up as being one of the most influential albums to stoner rock/metal and consider it an album I've owned enjoyably for 7 or so years and counting (including a CD re-buy until I converted it to digital format.)  I highly recommend it.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I first discovered Andrew Davies when I fell in love with his 1995 adaptaion of Pride and Prejudice.  Since then, I look for his name and know that I will love the movie.  Mr. Davies has a magical way of bringing Classic British Literature to life by preserving the integrity of the novel (ie not Hollywood-izing it).  His cast of characters never get in the way of telling the story, and the sets and settings bring it to life.  I first watched Little Dorrit on PBS Masterpiece Classic and could hardly wait till the next week to get the next installment.  I purchased it immediately when it became available.  I find myself watching my favorite bits over and over.  I STRONGLY recommend anything produced by Andrew Davies, and Little Dorrit is yet another triumph in his collection!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Alan Ball has created a series in True Blood that brilliantly captures the horror and eroticism of the vampire myth while being true to the source material in the novels.  Death, sex, addiction, violence, intolerance, friendship, love, acceptance, etc. all play a part of this show.  If this is problematic for you, then I suggest you watch that other, unbelievably popular, benign and neutered, vampire-movie-based-on-books.      True Blood is fantastic but, as reviews here also suggest, it is definitely (unfortunately?) not for everyone.      Here's a little guide to quantify your decision-making.    You will hate True Blood if you:  -Don't like sex or the idea of other people having sex  -Don't think love is complicated, painful, and sometimes silly  -Like monsters to be the good-guys, but only when they don't behave nasty and bad  -Like violence, but only body count, NOT graphic deaths (ie, no blood)  -If you think people taking big-time life risks and being pillaged by beasties should (would?) never use curse words  -Don't get/like satire, metaphor, or irony  -Blocked out that orgy scene in the books      Reminder: True Blood is an HBO series created by Alan Ball.  If you don't understand what this means, then you should not blindly pay money for True Blood.
B001W2I9Y4|5.0|This isn't Metallica going from Justice to the Black Album. Crack the Skye is Mastodon growing from a fantastic metal band into fantastic musicians.     Two things distinguish this album from previous Mastodon releases and make it, in my opinion, the early favorite for Metal Album of the Year:    1) The production is much more crisp and clean. This is something that bugged me about Mastodon's other works. They've been a little too muddy, a little too raw. This album is beautifully melded together. Like all Mastodon songs, there are a million pieces clashing with each other here. But they found a way to make them all blend without canceling each other out. It's less noise and more purpose.    2) The vocals are amazing. With three guys sharing the vocals, Crack the Skye offers a wonderful variety of vocal styles from one song to the next and within individual songs themselves. I have not heard a band put as much thought and effort into the way they structured their vocals since Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell were dueling each other in Alice in Chains. The vocals are now another instrument, not just an obligation. The contrast between Hinds and Sanders/Dailor breathes new life into every song.    Mastodon went into this album with an ideal combination of purpose and circumstance. A little history of the events leading up to this album gives you an idea of how and why this album came to be. Mastodon tried to capture a moment in time and put it on record. They wanted to open themselves up a bit more and express themselves through their music. They have achieved this with wild success. If Crack the Skye is the result, Brent Hinds should almost die before every Mastodon album.    Crack the Skye is unlike anything else. It is Mastodon's crowning achievement. It is Mastodon fully realizing their potential. No other band could make this album. Baroness: Mastodon just threw you a curve ball.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|This \\"new\\" release from Metallica is something I'd been putting off for a while. Since their previous album, [[ASIN:B00008OWZG St. Anger]] was almost used as a coaster, and their other albums since [[ASIN:B000002H6C Justice]] were just okay, I waited a while to see how other Metallica fans reacted to this album. There've been mixed reviews, and I heard a few samples that sounded nothing apart from the garbage they made in 2003. But I had hopes for this band that helped me through a troubled childhood, and, despite my better judgement, I felt I owed them one more shot.<br /><br />Death Magnetic is a huge step forward from St. Anger. It's a VERY different album from anything else they've produced. Lifelong Metallica fans would be better off coming at this album from a different approach. It's not the Metallica we know from the 80's, certainly almost opposite from the Metallica of the 90's, this album seems to attempt at getting to the basics of what make music work. And it does work.<br /><br />For one, we have solos once again. Though not the greatest pieces of music Hammett has written, the solos act as a distraction, and might take a few more listens to fit with the rhythm tracks. The exception is with Unforgiven III (though why they bothered to make a \\"part 3\\" is beyond me), where fans may hear the Hammett other albums had been lacking.<br /><br />Other most notably is the instrumental track, Suicide & Redemption. Fans had been waiting 20 years for something since To Live is To Die from Justice. And though it isn't anything like the instrumentals in the past, it IS pretty good.<br /><br />Overall I felt the album (except for the solos) had almost a progressive rock tone to it. Though nothing like [[ASIN:B000002JPA Dream Theater]], [[ASIN:B00006L83N Symphony X]], or [[ASIN:B00064WSN2 King Crimson]], it feels like an attempt toward the feel that made them solid in the 80's with Justice and [[ASIN:B0017WCERM Puppets]]. Hetfield's vocals, however, are on their last limbs and I doubt they've got much more left in them.<br /><br />A really good album from one of my favorite bands of all time. It's a step in the right direction, and I hope it only gets better.more left in them.    A really good album from one of my favorite bands of all time.

When Columbia films in their great stupidity cut it after its first release in Dec. 1962 (producer Spiegel's idea), then in the mid 1970's cut it unmercifully again, I was aghast and so sad.  The restoration of 1988-89 is almost like a miracle, seeing it almost whole again; going back to April 1963 when I first saw this glorious film as a young girl. I really don't know how to say more - I love it and him.    (P.S.  Can you tell Peter's also my unrequited love)?
B001KL3GZO|5.0|[[ASIN:B001KL3GZO Kind of Blue (Legacy Edition)]]<br />I first heard Miles Davis in the 'Sixties as a college student in New York. I used to go to Eddy Condon' club and nurse a drink for a few hours on a college student's budget just to hear some of the greats. I never saw Davis in person but loved his work. i'm also revisiting John Coltrane, who is featured with Davis on this album. The Rhino edition of The Very Best of John Coltrane is one of my favorites. And Dave Brubeck and Desmond's \\"Take Five.\\"  The harmonies are evocative of Bach's Fugues.  Too bad most of us jazz afficiandos are over Fifty (or Sixty)... the younger folks would appreciate it as well.<br />Jazz is a particularly personal experience: even in a club or a stadium, it has an intimacy like chamber music, which, come to think of it, it is.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The Caped Crusader is portrayed brilliantly in this movie. The storyline is deep and therefore the film may require more than one viewing to be \\"fully taken in\\" and understood. Joker's portrayal by Heath Ledger was absolutely amazing to say the least. Honor has once again been brought to the legend of the Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan and his crew. Well done!
B0012GMZ4U|4.0|I had this on vinyl but had to have it on CD. It includes the first song Barbra composed, but her rendition of \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is what makes this a must.
B00005JNJV|5.0|As the title says, I for one liked this film much more than its sequel \\"The Dark Knight\\". I feel that it stayed more to the \\"superhero\\" theme whereas The Dark Knight was more of a crime thriller (no harm in that of course). Liam Neeson's portrayal of Ra's al Ghul was excellent. Katie Holmes also played her part brilliantly. Christopher Nolan's story of the Dark Knight has gotten off to an excellent start with this film. This film helped me in an ethical/moral sense as well. Certain statements by the characters has made me think and act for the better (as the legend of the Dark Knight should). One of my favorite quotes from this movie as spoken by Batman.....\\"It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.\\"    Definitely see this movie.
0316017922|4.0|Outliers is an excellent little book on what makes people extremely successful.  It turns out that luck (or opportunities) and hard work are the keys to extreme success.  In Outliers Gladwell provides numerous examples in sports, business, arts, and other endeavors that prove this hypothesis.      This is a well written, extremely insightful, and interesting look at the real stories behind success.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT cd!!  I have bought it for me and my friend and we listen to it all the time.  I listen to it on my way to work and then listen to it allday at work.  All the songs are great! There isn't a song on the soundtrack I didn't like. Unlike most cd's I buy. Even my 5 and 7 year old kids love listening to it in the car.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|DeathRace is a good old-fashioned fun movie....great action and enough of a plot to keep the ball rolling.  The added clarity of Blu-Ray just makes the explosions and crashes that much  more brilliant.
B001CZVVWI|5.0|No need to elaborate. For Rossini's fans, this is an excellent work in every way. Don't hesitate, buy it
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Purchased for my (12y/o)daughter because she likes musicals.  She loves it and watches once a week.  Quality is gr8, considering the age of the original film.
B001W63DX2|5.0|Just watched a VH-1 broadcast of this last night.  WOW!!!!!   One of the best music docs EVER!  If you are a Maiden fan at all, BUY THIS.  If you haven't listened to an album in 20 years, BUY THIS.  The quality of the performances is better than ever.  The tour is incredible.  The ED Force One flown by Bruce?!?!?!!?!?  Stellar!  The crowds at these shows are like the most insane of all time.  You will get incredibly pumped watching this crystal clean looking and sounding MASTERPIECE!!!!  LOVE IT!!  Buying it now,  you should too.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind's plot revolves around the mystery of an obscure writer named Julian Carax. His novels are the obsession of a horribly disfigured madman, named after a character from Carax's books. This man who calls himself, Lain Coubert, the name of the devil in one of Carax's novels,  has made it his mission to find and burn each and every book written by the mysterious writer.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere, a boy who develops a fascination for the author after reading one of his novels, starts digging into Carax's past.. Daniel is determined to uncover each and every secret. Why is someone bent on destroying the work of an author found murdered in an alley? Each and every answer to his questions simply lead to more questions and answers that lead to nowhere. Daniel's curiousity turns the hunter into the hunted.<br /><br />Zafon's novel is about obsessions that torture and haunt various people. Some may even describe the novel as macabre, but it also about an intense and desperate love that somehow created a hatred so deep, it surpasses time and even death itself. My best advise is to pay close attention, even to the smallest of details throughout the book. Each and every character plays a pivotal role in the mystery of the infamous novelist, Julian Carax, and the reason why someone would want to rid the world of every novel written by this man.<br /><br />This is a book I have every intention of re-reading. It has all the right ingredients that I look for in a book. The Shadow of the Wind is a compelling mystery that will keep you awake at night wondering how it will all end.  It contains a romance so tragic that it will make you wish you could rewrite the ending to give the characters a happy ending. It's not all doom and gloom however, the novel also features a wonderfully hilarious character that will make you laugh outloud. Who could ever forget Fermin Romero de Torres?<br /><br />I discovered this book by accident, and I purchased it based on the synopsis and some of the excellent reviews. Each and every one of those reviews were spot on. The Shadow of the Wind is like something written by Edgar Allen Poe. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is an author I will remember.  I am completely and utterly smitten by his writing!eviews. Each and every one of those reviews were spot on. The Shadow of the Wind is like something written by Edgar Allen Poe.

1439130833|3.0|I was expecting an actual book, not a flip through, pull off the pages as you go, thought of the day book.  When it said \\"daily teachings\\", I really thought it was things you needed to do everyday to acheive your goals.  i don't want to wait 365 days to tear off each page, so I am flipping through it reading 30-40 pages a day.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|My only regret--no CD. The entire DVD was excellent. While the rest of the band was introduced, and while the band is called \\"The Eagles\\", they wouldn't be the band they are without their backup band, particularly Stewart Smith, who on their \\"Long Road Out of Eden, contributed and wrote some of the music and lyrics.
B000059PR5|4.0|1983 was a difficult year in Soviet-American relations following the Soviets' downing of a South Korean civilian airliner. Washington reacted by deploying nuclear missiles in Western Europe. In November of that year Soviet intelligence misinterpreted a NATO training exercise, codenamed Operation Able Archer, as the prelude to an all-out U.S. pre-emptive nuclear strike. It is in this context that The Day After sheds light (as it should do) on the much lessened, yet still relevant, threat of nuclear war and its deadly effects on mankind. The movie is set in the early eighties so there is plenty of cigarette smoking, bad haircuts, and silly lines. Jason Robards, Steve Guttenberg, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, though the acting is nothing extraordinary. In short, though not a masterpiece, The Day After is indeed an interesting film with an important message.
1439157383|1.0|Loved this book until the end, the ending was just awful and ruined the entire book for me.  Jodi Picoult has done the same thing with her newest book, Handle with Care.  I couldn't wait for that book to come out for my Kindle, I bought it the first day it was out and again I was so annoyed at the end of the book.  I will not be reading any more of her books.  Sorry I spent the money to buy that for the Kindle, wish I would have gotten it from the library for free.  Why does the author do that??
B00111YM5G|4.0|Gabriel is the seventh, and last of the Arcs (Angels), to be sent to \\"The City\\" (i.e. Purgatory) in order to defeat the Fallen (Angels) and release their grip on the souls therein. There are slight hints of Constantine and The Matrix and strong elements of the Prophecy Trilogy (starring Christopher Walken) so the movie falls into the action/adventure category. Moreover, the film brings to mind the Dungeons and Dragons' Planescape setting and the fascinating philosophy associated with it.     Andy Whitfield and the rest of the cast do a very good job in their respective roles (though the acting in nothing extraordinary). The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music, make Gabriel a film definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I love this movie!!! I ordered it with normal shipping and the movie got to my house in about two days and was in perfect condition! Can't wait to do future deals with you!

B001FB4W0C|4.0|Speaking as someone who has been with Supernatural from the get go (and loving every minute of it) I'm just as excited as all the fandom at the upcoming release of the DVD box set for Season four.  This show has always been a five star series for me.  The only reason I'm not giving it a five here is because I'm waiting to see if the DVD release of Season four has all of the extra features I'm hoping for.  Season three was disappointing in that it had less episodes than usuall but I was also disappointed in the lack of good episode commentary and behind the scenes stuff.  I know alot of people don't care for commentary but if it's done right you can really get alot of new insight into a show and learn about things you didn't already know.  Aside from the regular director/cast commentary, I'm really hoping to hear more commentary from the writers and effects crew as well as some of the supporting cast members like Jim Beaver or Misha Collins.  A special homage to Kim Manners would be nice.  Also some effects reveals (like how did they get Sam to roll around on that wall in \\"when the Levee Breaks\\"?)  What can I say, I'm a sucker for behind the scenes reveals.  I'm sure the gag reel in this season will be really awesome.       This show has truly been a credit to Erik Kripke's genius.  It's very difficult to come up with a solid plot line to last five seasons but boy has he delivered.  Add to that, the strong team of writers and an amazing cast (whoever casts for this show should get an award!!).  I find it more kismet than coincidence that the two stars of this show are not only both from Texas but are both middle children in families of a younger sister and older brother.  These two guys were destined to find their way into each others lives as actors and friends and it really shows in the chemistry they share on screen.  I can't wait to see what happens next season and what kind of extras are on the DVD set for Season four.  I'm happier than a puppy with two persqweeters!
B0026OE2NY|5.0|Home is an excellent documentary which aims to familiarize us with our planet while reminding us of our place and responsibilities vis-à-vis our environment.   The amount of effort and research put into this project is evident and as a result the documentary helps transport the viewer to different locations allowing one to lay eyes on natural wonders and disasters alike. Glenn Close does an amazing job narrating in a way that brings to mind the Lords of the Rings, while the photography is simply breathtaking!   In short, Home is a must-see documentary, strongly recommended to those people that do care about the legacy they leave behind for the generations to come. 5 Stars
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this gameboard for medical reasons initially and absolutely will not game without it again.  On the days that I play WoW, It is not unusual for me to be on for 8 hours or more.  I have tried all kinds of remedies: wrist pads etc, to get the pain in my left arm to stop.  With the G13 I can rest my full hand on it very comfortably in a natural position. I noticed results immediately, the pain has stopped.  The keys are perfect in the dark as only the letters light up and there is no light bleeding from around the keys. Huge array of colors to chose from and switch on the fly multiple profiles mean the board changes with the game. The G13 has some weight to it so it wont slide at all.  Seriously this is built to last. the software is thorough and easy to use, and the profiles that are onboard for most games are plug and play. By far, this is THE must have product for all pc gamers.

B001NLKWLW|3.0|I read so many rave reviews about this book and I truly wanted to love it.  But I am still trying to make my way through it.  I set it down for a week or so and now that I have come back I have forgotten all the little details of the many characters and trying to make sense of them all is time consuming.  The book focuses on 3 different women at three different times in history and they are all intertwined, but keeping them all straight is becoming more of a chore than I like my reading to be.    The writing is wonderful and the story, I am sure, is enchanting...I could have just done without the traveling back and forth and back again through time.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|This is truly one of the worst films I have ever tried to watch.  I left the room after the whole pubic hair incident and accusing Lydia of being a lesbian.  It was all absolutely unnecessary and ruined any chance of me finishing the movie.  I can accept bad acting and some liberties being taken to keep Jane Austen's work afresh today, but this was beyond a disgrace.  Trash like this movie makes me appreciate works devoid of modern filth used in order to attract a larger audience.  Sex has become a perversion and I am really outraged that anyone who has the power to give permission to Jane's work being used allowed her name and characters to be associated with this movie.  Nothing Jane Austen about it other than beloved characters being stripped down and degraded.  Words cannot begin to describe how awful this movie is.<br /><br />Things to note with this edit:  1) It was Lydia and not Jane as I had incorrectly stated earlier that was in the bed.  2) I stand by my original review but will add that it was not only the missuse of Jane Austen's ORIGINAL work that ignited my dislike, but how uncomfortable I felt trying to watch it.<br /><br />If you like silly, poorly scripted rip offs of popular characters and movies this is the film for you.  While the movie may be clever and original in taking a modern girl into the world of Jane Austen it lost all merit in not appreciating the world of Jane Austen.  Sure us modern folk would scoff and roll our eyes at men courting women and not jumping into bed with them, but some of us still like our women to be ladies.<br /><br />This movie did not add up.  If the heroine had been thrown into the times not already knowing the novel then I could understand her crudeness and stupidity.  However she did and thus is subject to my scathing and unsymphathetic review.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I was drawn to this movie because I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's other movies, such as Momento.  The movie was typical of his work, featuring a dense, winding plot that requires film watchers to pay close attention at all times.  I found the movie quite entertaining, and enjoyed piecing together the various plot clues and anticipating the 'twist' likely to occur at the conclusion.    Ultimately, however, I was disappointed by the film's final moments.  I was intrigued by cutter's comment early in the movie that \\"You're a magician, not a wizard.\\"  I had hoped this was foreshadowing, and that all of the seemingly inexplicable events would somehow be logically converge in the end.    Quite to the contrary, the ending of the movie is pure sci-fi, and it cheapened a film which otherwise featured fantastic but logical screenplay.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I heard about this CD & DVD set on Morning Joe and then got it for Mother's Day. The synchronization of voices and faces from around the world is truly beautiful. It is also a mix of familiar songs and new songs--great harmony, rich voices, beautiful instrumentals with harmonica, guitar, trumpet... I love it!
B00006RAKP|5.0|What can I say people? Admit it! You have missed your surly Seer, and for good cause! Who else can make your run the gamut of human emotions all within one review? I know I know people. You don't have to say it. I feel your love.<br /><br />Oh yes. I can see you all now with your Carmen Miranda sunny smiles and your Jack Nicholson antics. It's o.k. Stretch out! Relax. Enjoy. Bask in my aura and know that the all encompassing vitamin pill, known as me, is the Ponce de Leon you've been looking for. But treat me right, or else I will pack my bags and go home. You doubt me? Just try....<br /><br />I am here to have fun and review Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. Some say the song and title of this review is my theme song. Am I really that demanding and self-absorbed? Tell your Metamorpho the truth, but understand, I want you to tell me what I want to hear. So start now!<br /><br />Anyhoo, if you like Elton's songs, and who doesn't considering how many of these songs have crept into your cognitive brain cells and have mind-controlled you for many years, this really is a pretty complete collection of all the high points of his career.<br /><br />I tend to think his 70's contributions to be his best, however there still remains viable output over the next 3 decades. 3 Decades! Good grief. I can't be that old to remember it all. Then I forget I am pure spirit and do not age.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty nice collection. However, for purists like myself, there is much I miss. They only include \\"Your Song\\" from his first album. How nice it would be to have included \\"Take Me to the Pilot\\". Or, another favorite of mine, \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" from \\"Honky Chateau\\". With Elton, the output has been massive and so, there are many songs that are not included. In all honesty, this collection could have been 4 c.d.s. But, as I have said in the past, your beloved Metamorpho was not in charge so don't blame me.<br /><br />In closing. Elton and Bernie had the magical touch. They could always meld music and lyrics into such an appetizing array. And so, it's no wonder they have lasted so long and will be heard for decades to come. Which is more than I can say for many in the popular musical scene today.<br /><br />Anyway, if you enjoy Elton's tunes, this will more than satisfy. These are the words of Metamorpho - all heed my wisdom!<br /><br />Metamorpho sells cartoon balloons in town-- ;)o such an appetizing array.

B000VS6P9Q|4.0|The soundtrack to Todd Haynes excellent 2007 biopic of Bob Dylan contains 34 Dylan songs from all decades of his career. Only one of them is performed by Bob himself (the title track, also covered on the record by Sonic Youth), and while I usually prefer Dylan's own versions of his songs, I found this a strong and interesting album, with hardly a dud track on it. It would make a good introduction to Dylan's music for younger listeners not so familiar with him as older devotees.    There are a few flat moments - Stephen Malkmus and The Million Dollar Bashers' reading of \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" fails to recapture the biting scorn of the original, but perhaps that song, unlike a lot of Dylan's work, is too much of its own time. The same band though, headed by Eddie Vedder, do a thumping version of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\".(This song  must be intimidating for guitarists to play on because you know you are going to be compared to Jimi Hendrix, but Tom Verlaine and Smokey Hormel do pretty well.) Other highlights include Cat Power's \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again\\", and Rambling Jack Elliot's \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", but for me the standout track is Willie Nelson and Calexico's haunting performance of \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\" - just superb.
0446402397|5.0|This is a detective novel based in Soviet Russia.  I'm a sucker for period spy novels and detective stories (Martin Cruz Smith, Alan Furst, etc.) and this novel delivers.  I can't recall a book I've read recently that I enjoyed so thoroughly.<br /><br />I read about the follow-up in a recent newspaper story, and decided to start with this one.  Glad I did because the main character, Leo, is also the main character in the subsequent book.

055380684X|5.0|Coyle has taken a fair amount of recent neurological research and expert performance theory and used it to interpret how talent hot-beds such as Brazilian \\"futsal\\" soccer, a Russian tennis camp and a successful charter school in California nurture talent to extraordinary levels. It's an easy, compelling read for someone interested in \\"how\\" great talents get that way. A lot of the examples are from athletics. I'd love to know whether Jim Collins thinks these insights might be useful in a corporate setting, but the real audience is probably the adventurous spirits who are trying to figure out how to educate kids to be more effective at what they do, how to coach better, how to help some youngster turn into the next Sarah Hughes, Yo-Yo Ma, Michael Phelps or Tiger Woods. Hopefully, there are many such spirits out there, and they will take the few hours needed to absorb The Talent Code. That might be the powder needed to blow up a few of the stultifying bureaucracies that all-too-often pass for \\"school\\" or \\"education.\\"

Ideal to plump out a set with some memorable music.  Concisely presented, which means less page-turning.  Also great to see their idiosyncratic changes written out, ripe for the picking.  Inspirational.
0439882826|5.0|This is the PERFECT book for Star wars fans. I can't say a single bad thing about it. I cannot find a single flaw. In addition to giving you information about the movies, there are stunning, unbelievably gourgeous pop-ups coviring each page. Also, bgecause pop-up books are normally geared toward children, I want to say that this is for everyone. It is not only for children. It will provide hours of enjoyment and I recommend it to anyone who wants a stunning new addition to their Star Wars collection or who wants to learn more about Star Wars.
B00006674X|3.0|Yes, yes, I know, \\"why\\" would I like seeing nuns in their old habits? Right?! Well, Not many in today's world see nuns at all! Thanks to Vatacan II and the enemy within the church! *(Not unlike the creeping enemies within our own government!) This movie, like all movies with Elvis was ok, but a little corny. I mean I saw him in \\"Blue Hawaii\\", when it first came out and I was all alone in a huge theatre. Not because the movie was bad, but because I went early on a weekday when everyone was at work and I was just a kid. It cost me a whole half dollar! *(50 Cents!!!) That was a lot back then, especially to a kid! I used to play hookey from school and hide under our steps after buying potato chips, ice-cream, chocolate milk and some candy, all for about 25 cents!!! Maybe a little more than that, but not much! The truant officer never found me! lol Times were great, back then! At least to a child. I had no clue we were on the brink of distruction, bought on by the election of the Kennedy clan, who are the ones who really distroyed America. *(Ted with his \\"1965 NEW Immigration policy\\" that opened the flood gates to the terd-3rd world and open border fiasco we see today!!!) Anyway, this movie was a reminder of hippie-liberal times that turned the nation away from traditional values to the new anything goes era. It's nice to see Mary young again too! Who ever would have thought she'd be on Elvis' hot babe list?!! I miss the nuns of yesteryear in their habits, especially the ones at St Anthony's and the large hats of St Vincent de Paul nuns. Now you have slave women walking around in burkas all over the place instead!!! Not Christian nuns! The world's upsidedown! Thanks a lot, brain dead Ted! The murderer and blood sucking leech of the Senate that road into politics on the coattails of death and prospered much ever since! This movie brings back times of chaos and soul searching. Finding out who we were and changing times of very selfish people. We could have done without thesongs in the film though. I do recommend this movie. It shows those who were not born to see the 60's & 70's what it was like, somewhat. Only a documentary shows that though.
B000002UCN|4.0|I wish there had been more post-Beatles songs like \\"Dear One\\" because I personally love his spiritual songs.  All this is subjective, of course, but highlights include \\"Something,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"My Sweet Lord, and \\"Give Me Love,\\" so that's five winners, but there are eight other songs that are far inferior.  It should really be called \\"The Most Popular ...\\" rather than \\"The Best ....\\"
B001GQ2TGA|2.0|I have been an Enya fan for many years, but I was disappointed by this CD.  The music was uninspired and mundane. Her rhythms were typical of other music and I did not find her rendition of standards exciting.  The most creative aspect of the CD was the cover picture.
0385341008|3.0|Entertaining read but contrived characters.  The \\"good\\" characters are good and the \\"bad\\" characters are bad. There are the array of quirky and charming characters that will, I'm sure, make a lovely Miramax film. The overall light-hearted (dare I say \\"sunny\\") tone lessens the impact of the horrors which also occur in the book. All that said, it was clever and entertaining enough for a beach/vacation/airplane read. Enjoy without too many expectations!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Hollywood's current \\"it\\" director JJ Abrams, best known for his television shows, \\"Lost\\" and \\"Alias\\" and the film, \\"Cloverfield\\", takes the helm of the new Star Trek movie, rebooting the franchise in a very successful manner. Taking aim at last week's number one movie, \\"Wolverine: X-Men Origins\\", Abrams new film will most likely supplant Jackman's film at the top of the box office heap. Even President Obama, apparently a Star Trek fan, is asking for a viewing of the highly anticipated summer film at the White House.<br /><br />With a cast of youthful actors led by Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk (looking like he stepped out of an Ambercombie ad), the familair faces of the Trekkie universe are given a much needed rush of youthful adrenaline and appeal for a new generation of fans. Pine does well as Kirk, a womanizing and extremely independent young man who finds purpose as a Starfleet cadet. Uhura (played by the alluring Zoe Saldana) and McCoy (Karl Urban) are introduced early on as well as Sulu (Harold and Kumar's John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Of course the pivotal and important role of Spock is played by Zachary Quinto of NBC's \\"Heroes\\" fame. He steps easily and comfortably into the role made famous by Leonard Nimoy, who much to the pleasure of diehard fans, appears in the film as well. Other interesting cameos or supporting roles include Wynona Ryder as Spock's human mother, Ben Cross as Sarek, his Vulcan father and more surprisingly, Tyler Perry (the Madea movies) as a high ranking leader at Starfleet Academy. Eric Bana (Hulk, Munich, Troy) is vicious as Nero, the disillusioned Romulan who is determined to take his vengeance on Spock and all of the planets in the Federation.<br /><br />But the brunt of the film's success lies on the shoulders of Abrams, whose story telling must draw fresh viewers who haven't seen the previous films or television programs while pleasing the dedicated fans of Roddenberry's original vision.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Disney/Pixar is on a roll. After delivering last summer's endearing \\"Wall-e\\", they've again upped (no pun intended) the ante and created another animated masterpiece that will appeal to children and adults alike.<br /><br />The story follows Carl, who as a young man, dreamt of great adventure. This love led him to his wife, Ellie, who like Carl, fantasized about a faraway place in South America. As on old man and now without his beloved wife, Carl faces the loss of his home, the one connection to his wife, and being forced into a retirement community. When Carl is finally pushed to the brink and makes a bad decision, the courts decide its time for him to be placed in a nursing home. Carl, however, has other plans and, unknowingly with a persistent boy named Russell in tow, floats away toward the site that his childhood hero visited in his great exploits. Once there, Carl quickly finds out that his hero is not all he was cracked up to be and must find a way to safely return Russell and himself home.<br /><br />This little film, like \\"Wall-e\\", is one of the most charming and touching in the Disney/Pixar pantheon.  Comparable to \\"Wall-e\\" with its environmental message, this movie also delivers an important commentary about friendship and the importance of living life to its fullest. There are several scenes that are sure to tug at your heart strings but also enough laughs and action to keep the little ones happy. The characters are rich and well developed---Carl, a loveable old curmudgeon (voiced by Ed Asner) and Russell, a sweet kid who needs a paternal influence in his life. My favorite character is Doug, a \\"talking\\" dog, who's dialogue is exactly what you would picture a dog saying if they could really speak. I think he will be the Dory or Jack-Jack of this film, well loved and received by young and old.<br /><br />As usual, Pixar's animation is a feast for the eyes, full of beautiful, bold colors and crisp imagery that compliments the various locales that the adventuresome duo visit. I think it will do well during the summer movie season and would be seriously surprised if it wasn't awarded a certain golden statue next year for best animated feature film. A must see movie for the entire family!!think it will do well during the summer movie season and would be seriously surprised if it wasn't awarded a certain golden statue next year for best animated feature film.

B00246VKFM|5.0|In \\"Life is Beautiful\\" Roberto Benigni has made a warm and romantic film filled with the joy of living. There are happy and magical moments scattered throughout this Italian masterpiece, but it is Benigni's handling of the holocaust that gives this film substance.You often hear this foreign film described as powerful and moving but upon viewing it for the first time you may wonder what all the fuss is about, until you reach the end and finally feel the impact of what Benigni has been trying to say.<br /><br />The film opens in Arezzo, Italy, in 1939, Benigni and his pal just a couple of happy-go-lucky Italian guys looking to make a place for themselves. Benigni wants to open a book store but will end up waiting tables instead while he charms his princess in spite of her imminent engagement. Benigni's lovely wife Nicoletta Braschi plays the girl of his dreams and falls for him because he makes her laugh. Their romance is tender and funny, with a touch of the sweet flavor of an Italian bread.<br /><br />A few years down the road, now with a book store and a young son, their lives begin to be intruded upon as anti-Semitism reaches its zenith. When his princess arrives home one day, she finds them missing, taken by soldiers. Hunting them down she forces a soldier to allow her to share in their fate, whatever that may be, and boards the train for the camps as well.<br /><br />Benigni makes the conscious decision to shield his son from the evil around him and save his innocence, convincing him it is all a game, the grand prize a real tank; something his son can not resist. Separated from his wife in the camp he finds clever ways to let her know he loves her, resulting in some truly touching scenes.<br /><br />But the real question is whether Benigni can keep up this high wire balancing act long enough to save his son's life and his innocence. The fact that Benigni keeps off screen the horror of the Holocaust makes the ending more powerful, as we have seen everything through the eyes of his son, yet we know the truth his son does not. The final shot is joyous yet poignant, leaving us suddenly angry, moved by what we have seen in unexpected ways.<br /><br />This film is shown quite often in schools, and Disney has released this special edition for that purpose, with elements which will add to the discussion about this most important part of history, at an affordable price for teachers and schools. The power of this film is derived from the joy of living Benigni instills in it. This is a magnificent film probably not appreciated as much as it should be but a film that stands as a moving testament to all those who did not get to continue the joy of living. No film library or school is complete without this foreign film masterpiece.we know the truth his son does not.

B00005ASOC|5.0|I loved this movie, it was such a nice surprise. The young man I haven't seen in any other films, but I did recognize a young Anna Pacquin. Sean Connery was the best part of the film for me, thoroughly enjoyable.
B000UJ48SQ|4.0|A technological tour de force, no less than every film to come before from Stanley Kubrick. But this one has a sense of \\"no urgency\\" (as opposed to \\"no sense of urgency\\") and it's easy to see Kubrick looking back for a moment and breathing a sigh of relief ...\\"Well, I got THAT out of the way!\\" ... and realizing he was at the summit and he was the only one there, took some self-indulgent time to make love to his cameras again, coaxing them to do things they had never been intended for.      This was good time for Stanley, and he shows it.

B0026FCKVO|5.0|This was the last film that Audrey Hepburn made before she retired at age 38, deciding to quit while she was still on top. Although she later made ROBIN AND MARIAN with Sean Connery, and made a few later appearances in later films, this was the end of her star career. Appropriately, it is one of her very greatest performances, with her skills as an actress, if anything, continuing to grow. Audrey plays a woman left alone in her apartment who is preyed on by three men attempting to recover a doll filled with narcotics her husband has accidently acquired.<br /><br />The cast carries this film. Audrey Hepburn is so good that it would have succeeded regardless of what anyone else in the film had done. As a recently blinded person learning to cope with her new condition, she is utterly convincing. She manages to persuade completely the viewer that she really is quite vulnerable yet completely unwilling to give in to her situation. Alan Arkin, in one of his earliest film roles and his first since his Oscar nominated performance in THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING!, gives a chilling performance as Roat, the leader of the bad guys. It was interesting casting, since Arkin was primarily a comedian, one of the founders of the Second City comedy troupe. It is one of the finest performances of his career. Richard Crenna was primarily known as a TV performer at the time, having been a regular on two of the most successful shows of all time, OUR MISS BROOKS and THE REAL McCOYS. He is very effective as the con artist who comes to like and admire his would-be victim.<br /><br />It is not a perfect film. If one didn't already know that it had been a stage play, any perceptive viewer would be able to tell by watching. It is a profoundly \\"stagey\\" production, and the way the various characters traipse in and out of her apartment is a bit hard to swallow at times. It feels too much like characters walking on and off stage in a theater. Still, the acting is so exceptional and the situation so compelling that it is easy to cut the film a lot of slack. I will add that the last fifteen or twenty seconds of the film are a little off putting. It functions on a symbolic level, but it unsatisfying emotionally. I wanted to scream: \\"Just go give the woman a hug, you jerk!\\"<br /><br />The last thirty minutes of the film really are about as scary on a psychological level as anything Hollywood has produced. When it was originally shown in theaters, in the scene where Audrey Hepburn begins breaking all the light bulbs in her apartment, the theater would either darken or dim the lights in the house, with each bulb she would shatter. In the spirit of that, I definitely recommend watching this one in a darkened house.on so compelling that it is easy to cut the film a lot of slack.

B0006L0LOS|2.0|Once I watched the extra features on the disc, I changed my opinion about the flick; it went from horrible to mediocre.    The extras explain that there are many cat-women, and this is just a story of another one.  Seeing how Halle Berry trained for the part made me appreciate the performance.  She really does behave like a cat, even though some of those scenes are really stupid.  Lastly, the Producers nailed the movie they were trying to make.    This is the problem with this movie; if you are going to make a movie called \\"Catwoman\\" using the DC license, then your movie must star Selina Kyle.  Shame on DC for green-lighting this pic as a major motion picture.  It might have worked if they had given the movie a different title, something like \\"Tails of a Catwoman.\\"  The bottom line, this catwoman story should have gone straight to dvd or tv.
0060775858|4.0|Although I personally did not grow up with this book in my library, I've enjoyed getting to know it with my son.  As soon as we started reading this book together, it became one of his favorites.  The bright colors and the variety of items to pick out and name make it entertaining.  I am curious to see if others have run into the same thing: my son likes balloons a lot, so the \\"red balloon\\" was definitely a focus point.  At 17 months old, he was pointing out the inconsistencies- from one picture to the next, the red balloon and its string will disappear and then reappear.  My son will point to where the balloon is and then where the balloon should be on another page.  Has anyone else run into this?  I'm curious why the author created such inconsistencies (unrealistic for a balloon, ok for a moving mouse)- were these just errors that happened upon publishing that were never corrected?  Nevertheless, we still enjoy the book (glad to see his eye for detail) and recommend it.
B001GCUER0|3.0|Chain smoking, alcoholic, over sexed pretty people that also happen to be sad.  When I first heard of the premise, the lives of 1960's ad agency people, I was very excited.  I had assumed they would be focusing on the truly interesting Machiavellian type projects and theories of people like Edward Bernays.  If anyone doubts the dramatic possibilities of this topic, just watch the BBC documentary by Adam Curtis, \\"The Century of the Self.\\"  Instead, the fact that they are ad agents takes a back seat to typical soap opera themes and story-lines.  As it stands, the show could be set in a mall or insurance agency with few changes to the plot and dialogue.  To be fair though, the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is superb, but its my opinion that the stories themselves could be so much more interesting.  I was hoping that this season would be different from season one, but sadly it's just more of the same.      If I had to breakdown pretty much every Madmen Show, it would look something like this:      30% people staring off into the distance smoking/drinking   10% lingering shot on random object or person  50% loud sloppy kissing/sex, or dialogue about sex, relationships, drinking, smoking  10% actual interesting dialogue about inner workings of ad agency or deeper topics     I gave the show three stars because of the high quality production and acting.  It is better than a lot of things on television, but after watching shows like the Wire and the first four seasons of the Soprano's I guess my expectations have been set fairly high.  Pretty much every other program out there has the whole sex and marital problems crap covered.  There is quite a lot of untapped potential in the ad agency aspect.  This show shines when the writers focus on the deeper issues of race, women's rights, politics (the media side of it), and the whole persuasion game.  With the right focus, I think Madmen could be one of the greats.
B00164KYV4|4.0|Several reviewers have identified this film as being for the dating and coupling scene of youth.  I disagree.  We have many older folks out in the dating arena, these days, going through some of the same angst of the younger generations.  Will they call?  Do they care?  Are they married and hiding it?  And, for many older women who have become accomplished, they have to wonder; are they after me, or my hard-earned, success.  So searching for Mr. Right, over the course of our lifespans, doesn't change that much; in fact, it can get more complicated. So, in essence, this movie can provide some thoughts to ponder across the age spectrum. A very good thing, since even seniors, can turn into gushy teens, again, when shot by Cupid's arrow.<br /><br />(SPOILER) Some felt that the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jeniffer Aniston's characters was a tad unbelievable; that they would live together for 7 years without marriage and that ultimately Ben's character would cave. I disagree, again; their relationship rang the truest. They had a very loving, faithful relationship, that had endured time.  When Aniston's character removed the obstacle of marriage, Ben's character no longer felt he was being forced into conformity.  It was then HIS decision; one conceived in freedom-of-choice. This was textbook Psych 101, 'you can take the horse to water, but can't make him drink,' until he darn well pleases.<br /><br />The idea of 'marriage' was the area I found unsettling, because how many of us ladies were the one to drop the, less than subliminal, idea of 'marriage' first?  If so, it makes you wonder if your partner really wanted the same thing, or if they just 'settled.'  This was very well, and sadly, depicted in the Connelly relationship.  And, for many who did push the commitment proposal, first, I suspect it will have them staring into their partner's eyeballs with some jaded contempt, wondering why they didn't have the storybook proposal, while strongly empathizing with Connelly.<br /><br />The cast was stellar, with a few reservations. Drew Barrymore's character was irresistibly charming, as always. Johannsen's husband-stealing seduction was very well played out, and, is guaranteed to make you bring out the cat-claws.  You've seen the type too many times before, but then, she wasn't the problem, just a symptom of a much deeper one, which is generally the case.  The character I found most annoying was J. Goodwin. Yeah, she was cute, but too ditsy and trying too darn hard to connect with Mr. Right. Her behaviors were the most immature of the bunch, but we've all known friends like her; ones that we are always telling 'you can't find anyone if you're trying too hard---it will happen when you least expect it.' This philosophy even rang true for her.<br /><br />I thought this film could have been better developed, and the messages deepened. It had a 'flaky' factor I did not embrace.  I'd rate it a B+ accomplishment. However, I will still recommend it to all my friends that remain on the prowl; even for those that believe they've found their soul-mate, because it reminds us that things aren't always as they appear; that denial can exist in what is believed to be the perfect union, leading to lost years and promises---and life is too darn short.<br /><br />Have a girl's night, watch it, and cherry-pick the scenes of wisdom, and/or the behaviors that apply to you.  I can almost guarantee that you'll find some.he cast was stellar, with a few reservations. Drew Barrymore's character was irresistibly charming, as always.

0887307280|4.0|I listened to the audio version via Audible.com.<br /><br />Gerber tells us what's wrong with the way we run our small businesses and how we can do it better. He does so by telling the story of his consultation with a pie shop owner named Sarah. The lessons contained in the book are transformational, perhaps revolutionary, and I'm convinced they'll change my life and my business if I'm able to implement them. Very inspiring stuff and I've already recommended the book to at least a dozen people.<br /><br />My only problem is that the author makes the same mistake as many other popular business book writers by turning his story into a fable. Truth is, I don't really care about Sarah or her shop. I don't care about her aunt or the way he uses her to personalize the lessons and manufacture drama. I had the same reaction to books like[[ASIN:068815428X Gung Ho! Turn On the People in Any Organization]]! and [[ASIN:0688123163 Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach To Customer Service]]: the way the story is told sounds like the characters are fictional. Even if they're real, presenting them like fiction makes me question the validity of the information. Not a good thing.<br /><br />I'd much rather read a shorter book that cuts right to it. Gimme the good stuff straight up. When I want to read a good story, I'll dig into some fiction. In that respect, someone like Guy Kawasaki does it better than anyone else. Check out [[ASIN:088730995X Rules For Revolutionaries: The Capitalist Manifesto for Creating and Marketing New Products and Services]]. Succinct and powerful.<br /><br />Nonetheless, The E-Myth Revisited has some great info and is well worth the read.

0756404746|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm in no way a fantasy novel expert. I've probably read only a few fantasy novel series in my time but that doesn't mean I don't love the genre. I've loved the works of David Eddings [[ASIN:0345340442 The Belgariad Set, Books 1-5: Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, Magician's Gambit, Castle of Wizardry, & Enchanter's End Game]] and found myself frustrated (like everyone) with Robert Jordan's works [[ASIN:0812538366 The Wheel of Time (Boxed Set #1)]] in their never ending saga that should have ended years ago. Unlike many, I found Tolken to be dreary, boring and long-winded and probably like many, I found the Eragon/Paolini series [[ASIN:0375846158 Inheritance 3-Book Hardcover Boxed Set (Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr)]] to be simply a copy of works that came before it. So consider this a review from the casual reader instead of the fantasy expert.    All that said, I'm trying to decide whether this is one of the best books I've read in a very long time or... or what? I don't know. The writing style is so much more advanced (higher quality?) than the standard prose we're commonly delivered that I'm at a loss for words. That would make one of us though as the author is never at a loss for eloquent words. That is to say, the author uses words that aren't ready meet for the 14 year old reader -- they're -- more appropriate, more advanced, more... accurate and it's subtle and refreshing. It's like being spoken to as and adult rather than a child and it's high time.    Probably my only dislike for the book would be the plethora of terms that simply aren't part of our vocabulary that are used. For instance, we're expected to understand who and what the \\"Fae\\" are without any explanation. Are they good, are they bad, are they...? Who knows. I suppose in a sequel we'll find out and I'd probably be less put out if those books were already published. To be left wondering exactly \\"what\\" a main character in the story actually \\"is\\" is unsettling. I liked the imaginary world filled with uncommon characters -- I'm just used to an explanation from the author.    Regardless, I loved the book. When I finished it I felt like rereading it like I'd missed something. In reality, I have -- it's the rest of the story and I long to read it.    Well done Patrick -- please continue (quickly!).
1416914307|4.0|City of Glass does a commendable job of tying up the outrageous number of loose strings left behind by the first two books. However, I think this series has run its course. The Mortal Instruments is an enjoyable trilogy, but pushing for a fourth book would just be too much. Overall, I was pleased with the way this one wrapped up and am glad I invested my time in the series.
1416955070|3.0|From reading the inside cover I am a very big fan of sci fi, romance, and action so this seemed to be a perfect fit. I know this is a young adult novel, but I think the characters could have been a little older than 15 to beef up the story line. It just doesn't seem like a book about 15 year olds could be \\"dark and sexy\\", if that makes sense. I definitely agree with the reviewer below that the book was funny (at times but not really) and dark (they were slaying demons throughout), but definitely not sexy in the least. The only sexy part was a midnight kiss between Clary and Jace, which was ok, but they they turn out to be brother and sister. Did anyone else find that to be really weird/gross? I have no idea why this author would spend most of the book developing a romance between the two main characters, then have them turn out to be full blood siblings! It was a pretty good read, but it was definitely missing something I can't put my finger on, as other reviewers before me have said. I think it might have something to do with it read at about a 6th grade level and wasn't as creative or engaging as the Twilight series and others like it. This wasn't by any means a book I couldn't put down or one that I would have to go out and buy, but I will read the rest of the series through my local library. Lets hope Clare can come up with some more romance that doesn't involve siblings and more unpredictable twists and turns in the next book.

0684843749|3.0|Good book.  Taken comprehensively I doubt it has many peers as the \\"bible of bodybuilding\\".  But...if you are used to doing high intensity training.  Breaking up the body parts over 5 days or doing a more popular training split you need to be aware that in order to follow Arnold's recommended workload you will have to alter your training quite drastically.  Most people who lift actually overtrain on a given workout.  If you bomb your area and don't lift with proper technique controlling the weights through their whole range you will probably suffer.  Be absolutely sure to start these programs with much less weight on any given exercise that you are used to.  I recommend you gradually increase weights only as comfortable.  Good luck.

0711986746|5.0|Any fan of Freddie Mercury will enjoy reading this.  Clearly, a tale of near \\"hero\\" worship.  While he provides an insider's view, Freestone is very respectful of Freddie at all times, which I personally appreciated.  I think this was an honest depiction of the great relationship he had with Freddie and was not meant to dig deeply into the psychology of it.  Clearly, Freddie Mercury was a complicated man with a great passion for life, and not without a few flaws; but he was very generous, very giving of his time and energy, and he generated great love and loyalty from his close friends.  All this while creating some of the best music ever.  Freddie is one of the true musical geniuses of the 20th century.  Great pictures in the book.

0064407667|4.0|I loved this book! I was interested in reading it after I saw the movie A Series of Unfortunate Events, although I knew the books would be completely different. However, I wasn't prepared for just HOW different (in chronology, anyway) but still the very first book, in which we are introduced to the orphans Klaus, Violet and Sunny and the villain of the series, Count Olaf, is certainly a good beginning as far as I'm concerned! I look forward to reading more of these soon.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is one of those movies that didn't do so well critically when it first came out, though was appreciated more and more over the years. Sort of like Scarface. I found this one to be the most interesting because it dealt with a place that many do not know about. I feel that the other two use Nazi cliches and not that this one doesn't have Voodoo Indian cliches, but we've seen Nazi's so much in movies that its a bore. Also, this one is funny with the short round character and the girl. The action scenes are better than the first and a persons heart being pulled out is much cooler than someone's face melting. This one doesn't change setting every two seconds which makes it more interesting. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie the most out of the three, I hope you enjoy it as well.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|This movie is called both \\"Intellectually Weak,\\" and \\"In love with its own intelligence\\" Clearly, that alone makes this film worth your time and worth forming your own opinion about.<br /><br />The thing is, this is not a stupid film by any means. 'Visually stunning,' it is constantly called, but it's not just that: It's an assault on the senses (in a good way), both visually and aurally. The sound is incredible, the images stick with you. Even a simple, seemingly underthought image like the final two shots of the movie will stick with you long after the closing credits roll.<br /><br />But how is the story? I haven't seen the original in years, but this one held my attention, and kept my brain engaged. I give this one an enthusiastic thumbs up, plus a wink and a smile. It FEELS like the middle chapter in a story... there is too much left unresolved, and while seeing the first one isn't necessary to understanding this one, there ARE many references the original \\"Ghost in the Shell.\\" It's not so much a continuation of the story, as it is a continuation of the characters. Which I think is the better call.<br /><br />Constant quotes from literature is not a sign of intellectual weakness, I don't think. People accuse the movie of not having a brain of its own, but I think any movie that engages the brain of its audience needn't make apologies. This one remains interesting on all levels; I just hope it doesn't take them another nine years to produce part three.

I especially liked the scene on the glass bridge where he emerges from the smoke into the Hulk.<br />This is a must see movie.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Who would have thought that a girl who wears no underwear, drives with her infant children on her lap, and shaves her head in the middle of the night at tattoo parlors would have time to record an album?     Apparently, time is abundant in the life of everyone's favorite train wreck pop princess.     \\"It's Britney, bitch.\\"      And those words are the first thing that the listener will hear when they throw in her latest CD, \\"Blackout,\\" which hit stores last week.       Just in case you couldn't read her name on the cover, presumably.       With \\"Blackout,\\" Britney Spears is attempting to shed that young, innocent appeal and embraces her adult side and all the pleasures that accompany it with open arms.     Unfortunately for Ms. Spears, talking... er, singing about getting naked and how horrible it is to be bothered by the Paparazzi because she's so darn rich and famous is not what will appeal to most sensible adults.       It probably won't appeal to the legions of 13 year-old girls who love Britney, either.      Or maybe it will... everyone wanted a Chihuahua thanks to Paris Hilton, after all.     \\"Blackout\\" marks Britney's fifth studio album, and also the fifth time that she's attempted to fool the American public into thinking that she can actually sing.       Luckily, her label was smart enough to bring in some high-quality producers such as Danja, Bloodshy & Avant, and The Neptunes to mask the fact that Britney breathes/talks through most of the tracks, rarely stretching her voice high enough to break through the layers of effects that are indicative of each song.  The resulting sound is reminiscent of Madonna's \\"Music,\\" only with much, much less talent.     Lyrically, \\"Blackout\\" offers the listener a glimpse into what it's like inside of Britney's world.  On \\"Piece of Me,\\" she evokes sympathy with lines like \\"I'm Miss American dream since I was 17, don't matter if I step on the scene or sneak away to the Philippines, there still gon' be pictures of my derrière in the magazine.\\"     Yeah.     Anyway, the production is really the only reason to listen to this album, and it will probably do well in the club scene because of it.  The multiple layers and breathy vocals do create a nice, atmospheric sound that can be somewhat trance-like, especially with headphones.       However, putting this music that close to your head is not recommended.       Ok, so there are a few moments on \\"Blackout\\" that aren't that bad, but for the most part they will be forgotten as soon as they're gone, with a few exceptions...  you know, those really annoying melodies that get stuck in your head for days and make you want push an orphan into traffic.       Final thoughts... Britney, please forego the music and stick with flashing your crotch in public and being a horrible mother.  It's less painful for the rest of us.

This took some getting used to because I was expecting NIV.  The illustrations are very beautiful as well as instructive.   Really a great purchase.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I received this product well in time and I had no issues with the DVDs. They are original.
B000002GVO|5.0|When it was released in 1976, the demons that were the fast times of the 1970s still appeared to be saints and excess from sundown to sunrise was a way of life. And here was this sobering look into the wild ride that was never going to end.<br /><br />That the nine tracks that dragged out of the shadows the facade of living high and only caring about the next party with the \\"beautiful\\" people became so popular then - number one album for eight non-consecutive weeks, three hit singles, a pair each of Grammy Awards and nominations - and now, with more than 16 million copies sold, shows the lasting power of the incredible arrangements, if not the message surrounding such themes like shallow relationships, fleeting fame and the end of the \\"American Dream.\\"<br /><br />The hidden gems remain Try And Love Again and The Last Resort, espcially in the final verse of the latter: \\"And you can see them there, On Sunday morning/ Stand up and sing about/What it's like up there/They call it paradise/ I don't know why/ You call someplace paradise, kiss it goodbye.\\"<br /><br />With the original album photography retained and the sound bolstered by the remastering for CD release, this is an incredible work that says so much...and becomes more urgent as the hall of mirrors continues to be the lure for a funtime that turns into a hideous nightmare of no return.
0312965788|4.0|This book is about the life of an veterinarian (James Herriot) in the 1930's. This book starts out when the James gets out of veterinarian school and lands his first job. Each chapter in the book is a short story about one animal case that James was evolved in. The book goes into great detail about the surgeries and procedures involved in working with the animals. In reading the book one gets a good feel for the small town in England and the life that people lead in the town. One thing is that drinking and driving was not considered a problem in those time, because many times in the book they describe drinking at the bars all night and driving home without a second thought.<br /><br />Even though the book is a bunch of short stories it still have a slight common thread running through it and a nice ending. The book started off slow, but I got really attached. It was a nice relaxing read.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|This movie was actually better than I expected. I was expecting to give it one or two stars based on what I'd heard about it, but there was some funny dialogue throughout the movie and Robert Downey's acting was excellent. I also enjoyed the Tom Cruise cameo.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I just watched it for the second time, in two days, and enjoyed it even more than the first time!  The story has the right amount of dialog, action, interesting scenery and it also has a great plot. Bogart is great in his role as an ordinary man who becomes morally twisted by temptations of riches of gold from the dry mountains of Mexico. Tim Holt plays Curtin, his bland but steady partner. But my personal favorite figure in the movie was Howard, the older prospector who is basically at the center of the drama. Howard, played by Directer John Huston's father, Walter Huston, knows how to find and mine gold, and he also knows a thing or two about human nature. Sure, he is all for striking it rich, at least to get just enough money to set himself up for the rest of his life. But he also doesn't take the whole thing too seriously, and he knows how to laugh at the irony of fate when things don't turn out as planned. He's so perfect for the part! His attitude is a perfect foil to the paranoia of Dobbs, and he brings a comic relief when the fortune goes blowing in the wind. I really love it when he laughs his head off and even jumps up and down while he does it! He is able to put it all behind him, finding a good life with the native Americans who befriend him, and he also helps Curtin see the larger picture so he is able to move on to new plans more suited to him.    Great film and great story!
0385493622|5.0|This book may very well be one of the best popular books on mathematics written in this generation.  It covers the story of Fermat's Last Theorem, which was one of the most famous unsolved mathematical problems until its resolution in the mid 1990s by Andrew Wiles, with some assistance from Richard Taylor.  While this book does devote a considerable amount of time to the achievements of Wiles, a good portion of the book covers other mathematicians (and there were many) who tackled FLT.      You don't actually need to know a lot of mathematics to read this book.  It's not possible to understand even a (mathematically precise) outline of the proof of FLT without a lot of training, so instead Singh approaches the task of explaining lots of difficult mathematics through analogy.  (Actually, I would bet that even the author does not understand the technical details of Wiles' proof, so he was forced by necessity to take the approach he does in writing about FLT.)  In this, he succeeds marvelously, as we get an overview of what mathematicians tried to do to prove FLT, even if he doesn't explain the mathematical details.  His task is made considerably easier by the historical drama of the many fascinating characters in mathematical history.       This book contains an extensive number of drawings to help the reader visualize various mathematical concepts, as well as many black and white photographs of the people covered in the book.  Just as an added bonus, there is a copy of one of the opening pages of the proof of FLT that Wiles published, and it might give the reader an idea of the technical difficulty of his solution.      Singh does a great job of portraying mathematics as a vibrant, intellectually active branch of human thought, which probably is not the image most people have of the subject.  There is little doubt in my mind that this book has inspired many readers to go on and find out more about the world of mathematics.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This is a unique perspective of the Holocaust from eyes of two children - one German and one Jewish. I have never seen any film quite like this one.
B001FB55HG|5.0|I felt the movie was pretty decent and honestly to all of the people who are trying to compare it to the first two STOP IT!. We get those are classics and its going to be hard to top them but on its own salvation is a very solid action packed movie. I just read an article saying the movies bombing because it cost 200 million to make. Well lets see its not g really going to bomb because you have overseas box office plus dvd and blu ray sales so. Now back to the real topic it was a good movie everyone i went to see it with liked it even my dad and hes hard to please so take my advice go see it youll like it. Just dont expect the same you got from the original two and youll be pleased. Hey i thought this one was better than rise of the machines sorry but i did.

B0019X3YXM|2.0|The 2008 \\"My Sassy Girl\\" is, as you know, a remake of the Korean film of the same title made in 2001. But the remake went straight to DVD in USA, which suggests something is wrong with the film, but you know, Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" was almost released straight to DVD instead of getting a theatrical release in America, so you just cannot judge the film by that alone. In the case of \\"My Sassy Girl,\\" however, my instincts proved right.    In \\"My Sassy Girl\\" Elisha Cuthbert (best known as Kim Bauer in \\"24\\") plays the titular girl, slightly eccentric and unpredictable Jordan Roark. When good-natured, mild-mannered Charlie Bellow from Midwest (played by Jesse Bradford, \\"Bring it on\\") meets her on the subway platform in New York City, the girl is terribly drunk and she falls asleep on the bench. As Charlie is a kind guy, he couldn't leave her alone so he carries her (literally) to his room.    This is probably a highly unusual (and unlikely) way of getting to know someone else, but the film goes on anyway. Knowing that life with this strange girl is big trouble, Charlie continues to meet Jordan, who keeps cropping up unexpectedly, and virtually sabotages his career. I don't know why, but he thinks she is still attractive and irresistible, so Charlie starts seeing her and falls in love with her.    What is refreshing and intriguing in a certain situation doesn't necessarily look the same in another. Ji-hyun Jun's \\"sassy girl\\" in the original, so full of emotion, interested us because of the cultural background of the heroine and the hero and their reversed power relations between the sexes. Elisha Cuthbert's \\"sassy girl\\" on the other hand is only implausible and annoying. Her character lacks the soul that the original's sassy girl surely had.    Or maybe someone else should be blamed. Yann Samuell, known for his unique and dark romance \\"Love Me If You Dare\\" (starring Marion Cotillard), is clearly not the best choice for director of this film, of which story includes very melodramatic elements. You need confidence in telling this kind of emotional love story, but judging from his previous effort which looks like darker \\"Amelie,\\" Yann Samuell's strength lies somewhere else.    There are many romantic comedies set in New York City - \\"Annie Hall\\" \\"When Harry Met Sally...\\" and the list goes on - and like them the city itself plays a significant role in \\"My Sassy Girl\\" which is visually alluring. Sadly its soulless narrative lacks the charms and beauty of the photography.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|HBO has taken a thoroughly delightful series by Charlaine Harris and warped it into just another TV soap opera chock full of drugs, gratuitous sex, foul language and B movie violence.  Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire stories are imaginative, edgy and humorous.  Her lead characters are appealing and vivid. I had hoped the dramatization would be truer to the tone and feel of the books.  I am disappointed that HBO chose to ignore the charm of the Southern Vampire world and created just another Tony Soprano orgy of humorless drugs, sex and violence.  The books are so much better and so much more enjoyable.

B001TH16DI|4.0|First off i will say that I am not remotely even close to an expert in picture quality or audio quality, that being said the movies are an improvement from the dvds(I own the collection on dvd). Could they look better? Sure, i own other catalog titles that look better, but as someone that loves trek i could not wait and am satisfied with the purchase. I am sure later they will \\"double dip\\" the movies. Anyway my recommondation is that for the amount of movie and special features you get. It's worth the price of the upgrade. Also I thought the Season 1 Television series was outstanding, So if you liked the movies the series is even better.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I knew it would be a favorite of mine forever.  I cried so hard at the end the first time I saw it.

BYt i mean I love Jane Austen, and if this girl was such a great lover of Pride and Prejudice why did she act so rude and out of place. She should have known how to behave, what to expect from Darcy. Instead, she gave the impression that she did not know any of those people, or who they were.
1589944607|3.0|First off I am not a fan of the show, I've never seen it and don't plan too, so that colors my review.    The production value of the game itself is very nice.  The dials on the board are a very nice touch.  The 3d ships are nice.  My only gripe with the parts is that the skill cards are too small.    I do not like the way the game plays.  With four players, it quickly became very repetitive with each player either giving their turn to another player with the Executive Order card or doing the same thing they did last time.  There maybe a lot of characters to choose from in the beginning, but once you have chosen, there's only a few actions that do any good.  In a shorter game, repetitive actions aren't such a problem, but this isn't a short game.  The game I played took 3+ hours.     Also, the game is billed as a cooperative but the moment the Cylon player(s) is revealed, the rest of the table immediately becomes hostile.  If you are into the show, this might be fun, if you are not, it isn't.    Overall, there are many other games I'd rather play for 3 hours.  Please be nice to your non-BSG friend and don't force them to play this game.
0385341008|4.0|It all starts with a single letter, but that's enough to peak the interest of Juliet Ashton. The mention of a strange book club, the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, catches her attention and she yearns to learn more of this strange group. Through the letters she receives from various members (and non-members) of this society, she learns of the life on Guernsey during the German occupation during WWII. Learning of both the good and the bad, she becomes enamored with these individuals, and resolves to visit them on their little island, where she finds far more than she ever thought she wanted.<br /><br />Written as a series of letters between Juliet, her best friend, her agent, and the inhabitants of Guernsey, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society explores the relationships between any number of individuals, but it focuses on Juliet, a lost writer looking for a new book to write after the humor she wrote during the war no longer seems appropriate. The development of Juliet is wonderful and inspiring, as is the journeys of the characters she follows.<br /><br />There are sad tales, describing the horrors of the German occupation, but there are also tales of bravery and love. While the story starts slow at first, it quickly picks up pace and captures your attention right up until the end. You'll find yourself laughing at one character's attempt to act the spy, and cry when learning the fate of another.<br /><br />The telling of the story through letters leaves much of the plot out, and thus leaves much to the imagination. However, it also allows the characters to talk about what is most important to them and the internal battles they face throughout the novel. There is some left to be desired in terms of character development, as some characters seem too far on the edge to really be considered characters, fulfilling their purpose in the novel quickly, and then not mentioned again. The voices of the characters through the letters are very similar, in a way that almost makes it seem as if all the letters were written by Juliet. Still, the story unfolds well and leaves a satisfied feeling at the end.makes it seem as if all the letters were written by Juliet.

0525951113|4.0|Would gamers read Daemon by Daniel Suarez or continue to focus their efforts on increasing their skill levels within today's ever realistic multiplayer games?  After finishing up the semester I wanted to begin my summer with a fiction book before I started on the research for my master's thesis.  Daemon explores a scenario that is believable within the field of narrow AI, gaming, and a society which is filled people who believe in personal advancement and life over the greater good of society.  I found it a quick read and my interest was to look at how the author weaves in technology, the technologies chosen, and the reaction to the believability of an AI distributed Daemon's ability to control society, down to an individual level.

Thus, I went to this movie expected to enjoy it, like all of the previous Pixar movies.  However, I came away from the theater completely blown away by the \\"awesomeness\\" of it.  Up is a paradigm shift for Pixar and animation films--> it has a nice / funny story for kids but also has a very poignant story for adults, which in many ways couldn't be told as well via normal film making.<br /><br />3.  Bottomline:  go see Up and be blessed--> and as a result, be thankful for the life you've had and have.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Truly a remarkable film but, being me, I just couldn't help catching something which I think, smugly I might admit, not an accurate portrayal of the event. When Itzhak Stern mentions to Shindler while they are producing the list that he is smoking half the cigarattes that Shindler smokes, the film seems to allude that Stern is concerned about the damage to his health he might receive from passive smoking. But the list was made I believe in 1944, and at that time the medical community was far from conclusive over the health damage tobacco might cause. In fact, even during the 1950s you will still see doctors endorse certain brands of tobacco and the medical community publish something like \\"if excessive smoking actually plays a role in the production of lung cancer, it seems to be a minor one.\\"    So I think there is no way Stern could have known ciggies were harmful little cancer sticks in 1944. I have said all this not the dismiss the movie, because I think Spielberg has done a marvellous job as usual, and Liam Neeson has played Oscar Shindler wonderfully, and I am glad to have watched this movie, along with the Pianist, which is another movie that is excellently done about the war, but from a different angle. Perhaps I just want to remind myself that movies, as brilliant as they could be, are limited, and something has gotta give to keep the plot going. In fact, I see this kind of thing in every movie, no matter how great it is, you name it.
0307341569|5.0|I thought Dark Places was an engrossing novel.  I found it similar to some of Harlan Coben's works.  We have all seen tragic stories on the news of horror befalling families.  This story is about a survivor of a family massacre.  It was her testimony as a child that places her brother in jail for life.  This story explores what happens to her as an adult when she revisits the people and places involved in the death of her family.  Libby Day is not a sympathetic character, but in being so she becomes somewhat endearing.  This story has a good plot, the kind that makes youn want to get to the next page.  There are some excellent twists and turns along the way.  It is the development of the Libby Day character that I enjoyed most.  I heartily recommend this story.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|I really like mono. Some of the CD productions don't really sound authentic to me. Too many of them sound just flat and one dimensional. Some reviewers I think call this 'compressed' in a derogatory way, but compression is a good thing: it means balance between the loud and quiet parts. What they really mean is homogenous, I think, flat, one dimensional, etc. And yes, authenic mono should be more. It should be up front with a lot of kick and mixed differently. In the case of this Piper, it literally has completely different overdubs in parts. Some of the other really good ones are Stones Singles collection and Zombies Begin Here. The Zombies Singles sound questionable to me, but it may be the mastering and not the source. A Motown box called Hitsville claims to be mastered off the original 45 rpms, but have not heard. Tull's This Was in mono does not sound authentic to me. Sounds the same as the stereo mix, but in mono, you get nothing more. This mono Pipier is the real thing, as I have the original vinyl and the CD blows it out of the water, and not just coz it has no surface noise. I am just in awe they would even release this as the Floyd seems to want to play down the early stuff for some reason, Point Me, So Nice, Candy and Current, you know...

B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater has done it again. Metropolis is another great album. They never seem to dissapoint
B001QOOCTE|4.0|I heard about this CD on National Public Radio and had to check it out.  Definitely a wise decision.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|but don't start here.....begin with the 1st album and move forward. You will find a rock catalog like no other. By the time the group released this recording, Jim's voice was trashed by all of the alcohol, singing and smog. He still managed to sound great in a classic bluesy way. The entire band sounds tight on this release and getting Jerry Scheff (Elvis' bass player) to record with them was a good move. Now for the songs - \\"Changeling\\" is a perfect way to open the album. \\"Love Her Madly\\" sounds commercial but is still memorable. How could one band be so dark, so \\"underground\\" and yet make songs that were played on the radio? Such is the magic of the Doors. I personally love \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\", only the Doors could make this song. At the end, Jim decides to solo rather than Robbie, great vocal performance!! \\"L'America\\" is a great Doors tune and truly underrated. John's marching drums, the lyrics, and especially Jim's vocals. His voice is ragged in parts of this album but on this song it is clear and menacing. At the end of the song the entire group speeds up the tempo and John and Jim completely take over. It all ends suddenly and you think \\"that's got to be one of their best songs\\". But there's even more.....my other favorite besides \\"L'America is \\"WASP Texas Radio and the Big Beat\\" complete with more John Densmore magic on drums and Jim using a big, booming voice. This is classic Doors and it leads you right into \\"Riders on the Storm\\". Jim picked the perfect song to go out with and this tune is in the top 5 for most Doors fanatics. A great album that is worthy of 5 stars......enjoy..
0671042858|4.0|Im all for short books(not to short) but once in a while its nice to have a GOOD book that doesnt take to long to read.Fast paced and well told.Very detailed which I love.It took me to the places in the book.Thats what books are supposed to do!
B000MCIBB6|5.0|This album was originally titled \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\", complete with the entire recording centered around one long concept. The suits and ties basically freaked out and the group went back to Jim's assorted poems and writings for the \\"remaking\\" of this release. But it's still classic!! After all, this is the album that includes \\"Hello, I Love You\\", \\"Love Street\\", \\"The Unknown Soldier\\", \\"Five to One\\", a small section of \\"Celebration\\" and its greatest song \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" and the unforgettable \\"Spanish Caravan\\". Even though the album includes all of these all-time Doors songs, I personally like the \\"in between\\" tunes - \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\", \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\" and the most underrated song in the Doors catalog \\"Yes, The River Knows\\". If you've ever driven through L.A. or have lived there, this song is a musical equivalent to a photograph taken on a very smoggy, hot Los Angeles afternoon. Jim sings in this strange, twisted voice and Ray plays a tinny and compressed piano. The entire song is claustrophobic and magical. Robbie's solo is beautiful.....a true Doors fan has a special attachment to this album, if only for \\"Spanish Caravan\\". But I've never found a weak song on this release, which is amazing considering that the finished product was not the way the group wanted it to be.

0743454529|1.0|I am a living kidney donor, and hoped this book would raise awareness.  However, it so misepresents the medicine and ethics of living organ donation that I was completely disgusted.      First of all, no one can be forced to donate organs.  The ethics are very clear that the DONOR'S interests are primary, not the recipient's, regardless of a family's wishes.   The transplant team grilled me very thoroughly about my motives and desire to donate, and repeatedly offered me opportunities to withdraw, right up to the last minute.  If I had backed out, the recipient would simply have been told that the staff had eliminated me as a donor candidate based on medical concerns.  No one would know that I simply did not want to donate, and no one would try to convince me to donate.  My surgeon made it clear that he represented my interests, not the recipient's.  This is all standard procedure -- the accepted ethical practices of living organ donation.      It isn't easy for an adult to volunteer to donate and make it through screening, and it is almost impossible for a minor.  I participated in a living donor website for years, and many who posted were minors who wanted to donate to a parent or sibling, and were refused flat out -- not even evaluated.  A more honest novel might have a minor going to court to get permission to donate!      Further, you don't need an exact genetic match for a kidney or solid organ, the way you do for bone marrow.  The anti-rejection drugs are so good that parents, other relatives, friends or a total stranger could perfectly well donate a kidney -- no need to force a child to do it.  I was a zero match for my recipient and the kidney has been going strong for years now with no problems.  If you're a good enough match to donate blood to someone, chances are you're a good enough match to give an organ.    I was hoping the book would get people thinking about the possibility of giving life to another through living donation, but I was horrified at howit was misrepresented.  No medical process is perfect, but this book is totally off the mark.  Worse, it's sounds plausible to many people.  I've talked to friends -- including a physician -- who accepted the book's premise as factual and now believe a bunch of total hooey about how transplants work.  There is already too much misinformation out there, that puts people off the idea of donating.    Donation was one of the hardest and most rewarding experiences of my life.  It changed me -- not so much physically as emotionally -- in unexpected ways.  But it is a journey of partnership and consent between donor and recipient.  The goal, as my surgeon told me, is always to help a sick person get well without making a healthy person sick.

6305910189|5.0|The Wrath of Khan has the reputation of being not just the best Star Trek movie, but also one of the best SF movies of its age. Unfortunately, in recent years it has perhaps become better known for the numerous parodies of a certain seminal William Shatner moment roughly halfway through the film, although in-context it works a lot better.    There are several factors which combine to make The Wrath of Khan such a good movie. First off, it has an extremely well-drawn villain played by a good actor. Khan having previously appeared in the classic Star Trek series (in the first season episode Space Seed) gave him a decent backstory and rationale for wanting vengeance against Kirk without getting bogged down in continuity. It was many years after I first saw the movie as a kid before I saw the episode, and really all you need to know is that Kirk dumped Khan on a planet as a gesture of supposed mercy which ended up killing Khan's wife and several of his shipmates. RicardoMontalban plays Khan with a certain theatrical malevolence which treads a razor's edge between high camp and genuine evil. He also gets some ripe lines which he manages to dignify through totally believing in them. Seriously, who else could pull off, \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold, and it is very cold...in space\\"?    The second factor is that the script plays to the strengths of the individual actors and gives most of the Enterprise crew their own stories to follow (although Nichelle Nichols' Uhura and George Takei's Sulu are not as well-served as others) . Chekov, notably under-used in the actual series, turns up as the first officer of the Reliant who is captured by Khan early on and eventually ends up back on the Enterprise. There is a tragic subplot for Scotty, who gets his nephew a job as a trainee in the Enterprise's engineering department, whilst McCoy spends most of the movie trying to pull Kirk out of his brooding depression at turning 49. There's also the new character ofSaavik, Spock's protege who is angling for her own command. Effectively played by Kirstie Alley, Saavik serves as a viewpoint character for those viewers unfamiliar with the series. Oddly, a line referencing the fact that Saavik is actually half-Romulan , half-Vulcan was cut from the movie, whilst a later joke by McCoy referring to this fact is left in, somewhat confusingly. Spock only seems to have a minor subplot at the start referring to Kirk's guilt when he takes command of the ship from him, only to disappear in the middle third of the movie whilst Kirk,Saavik and McCoy travel to Regula. Of course, this was only to set up the unexpected ending.    The movie was also made on a crushingly small budget less than one-quarter of that assigned to its forebear, The Motion Picture. The crew had to work with their backs to the wall with only a limited number of sets, miniatures and effects shot available. Some shots from the preceding movie were re-used, whilst two-thirds of the movie took place on the same set, the Enterprise bridge which was redressed to serve as as the bridge of the Reliant. This saved enough money so that the final, iconic battle sequence - the Enterprise and Reliant playing cat-and-mouse in the Mutara Nebula - could be rendered as impressively as possible. The battle scenes in the movie are superb, with the ships acting less likeoversized fighters (a common complaint levelled against later movies and episodes) and more like the lumbering battleships they're supposed to be, dishing out and taking enormous amounts of punishment. The battle is also tremendously visceral, with decks collapsing and crewmen getting crushed, burned or subjected to lethal radiation in a manner that hadn't been seen previously on Trek (and led to the movie getting a hitherto unthinkable '15' certificate in the UK). Additionally, there's a small piece of history in the movie in the Genesis Device training movie, which is the first-ever 100% computer-generated sequence in the history of film.Particularly worthy of mention is James Horner's score, which re-uses a few elements from his earlier movies (particularly Battle for the Planets) but mostly consists of new material. His new overture, used for flybys of the Enterprise and the main title theme, is instantly classic.    Of course, what really got people talking when the movie was released was the jaw-dropping ending, which in the pre-Internet age had successfully been kept secret in a manner unlikely to be replicated today. It's still an emotionally powerful moment played by the actors in a convincing and almost poetic manner (the oft-mockedShatner is on top form throughout this movie and its sequel). In fact, despite the sometimes hokey dialogue as related above, the movie has a number of iconic lines and quotes (mostly from A Tale of Two Cities and Moby Dick) which help give the movie a thematically satisfying through-line. This is a movie about not just revenge, but age, finding your right place in the world and the fact that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (or indeed, the one). There's also satisfying attention paid to not copping out on the story. The writers couldn't conceive of a way that Khan and Kirk could meet without Kirk being killed, so they simply don't meet. And whilst victory is eventually won, it is only at a hard cost.    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (*****) is a great film because it doesn't go overboard on the gimmicks or macguffins (the Genesis Device - which doesn't really do much - aside) and simply has two enemies on two equally-matched ships slugging it out and one winning through the use of his wits. With strong thematic underpinnings, endlessly quotable dialogue, a score to die for, great effects and some solid acting, the movie overcomes a few cheesy lines, a couple of continuity gaffes and some 80s hairstyles to retain its place as not just the best Star Trek movie, but an entertaining and breathlessly exciting SF movie in its own right.

I believe that women are more willing to share with others about the highs and lows of dating and marriage.  I think this movie is WAY better than people have been rating it and I hope to add it my \\"own\\" list of dvd's.<br />I loved that some of the actors and actresses were not A-listers - it somehow made it more real.  I felt like I could relate with Gigi - the girl who is always hoping but also see myself in some of the other women.

B00004STPT|5.0|Linguistic irony abounds in this brilliant soundtrack. The Romans conquer the Germanic tribes in the Prologue to this motion picture; yet the major influences throughout Acts I, II, III and the Epilogue are, in fact, Latin-based and Germanic-influenced languages that work in silhouette to the musical score; Irish voices, Roman voices, Germanic voices, shades of antiquity, uplifting the fallen hero even as he drops to his knees before his crucified wife and son; shocking treatment of a commanding general's family (after he had led the Roman army to a victorious battle). Dramatic irony abounds throughout the score as well; partly because of the rich Irish-Latin-Germanic merge of songs, mournful chants, in-the-pit-of-death chords, compassionate voices (feminine, filled with empathy; con dolore), the conveyance of crescendo, decrescendo, diminuendo with the tongues of the vanquished; our hero had conquered the very people whose sorrowful tongues would mourn in Greek chorus the loss of his beloved wife and child; the Hans Zimmer score so laced with irony to render deep emotion.    In this redemption story, the chorus must echo the pain of the hero through voices that elevate the drama in its ascent through the first slaughter of the Germanic warriors, then through the second slaughter (above stated); if in mourning the chorus escorts the hero con grazia from his fallen state (he was dead with grief; then he was rescued; then he was glorified by gladiator feats), the voices of antiquity from many tongues with distinct, cultural nuances (history preserved) serve to uphold the magnificent instrumental orchestration (adhering to the Greek tragedian model) until our hero dies and joins his departed wife and son in the hereafter.      Powerful motion picture scores, like Gladiator, create the catharsis for the listener and for the viewer of the film: on many levels of classical accomplishment. We go back again and again to this movie, I think, because the soundtrack is superb;the epic tragedy is superior for its time; and our moments alone with the hero, Maximum Decimus Meridius, could leave an lasting impression on our psyche. This film was so honored because it truly was a masterpiece, in the tradition of Ben-Hur and the great composer Miklos Rozsa.

0767817710|2.0|I sat through this last night on network TV. Wish I could have that hour and a half back. This movie shouldn't really be called Western. It's more like a strange, dysfunctional parody that isn't funny. The dialogue is so trite that it distracts from good scraps of acting. The cast could and should have been impressive. Gene Hackman reprises his typecast role as the resident control freak. Sharon Stone is the absurdly beautiful victim seeking vengeance. The ending fizzles. If you enjoy graphic violence and not much else, this is the movie for you. If you would rather have characterization, plot and maybe even a life lesson, consider the other Quick And The Dead movie that stars Sam Elliott.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|The film started with a slow-paced exposition of Catholic school rituals and portrayal of characters.  From the moment I saw Meryl Streep's oppressive conduct during Father Flynn's rather simple-minded sermon, I knew that she would turn out to be the good person and he would end up being the scoundrel.  It was all expertly done but I thought that it was going to get boring. In the second half of the movie, however, the plot started to thicken.  Meryl Streep's performance in the film, especially during the verbal confrontation with Father Flynn, was so powerful that it took my breath away.  This performance alone made the film worth watching.  The film explores themes regarding the Church and the relationship of the Church to the real world.  Some parts of it were very disturbing.  The boy's mother did not seem to mind that her boy was sexually abused, as long as he would end up getting a good education.  That is not easy to understand today but her life situation back then was rather complex and difficult.  Sister Aloysius wanted to bring down Father Flynn at any cost, even if the boy ended up being expelled - she did want to protect other children though.  Sister James was supposed to be a naive, innocent character.  It would seem that she would not be capable of lying or withholding any information from Sister Aloysius but then she never mentioned the undershirt that Father Flynn put in the boy's locker.  Yet she found it important enough to investigate herself and later ask Father Flynn about it.  At the end, she expressed an outrage at Sister Aloysius for lying about calling Father Flynn's last parish (it was funny how scared he got when he heard that).  Perhaps I am wrong, but the character of Sister James may not be so feeble-minded as inauthentic.  The ending was very problematic - Father Flynn ended up being transferred to another parish and in effect even promoted.  Given widespread, systematic and pervasive sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests, itis not surprising.  Overall, the film is not sympathetic to the practices of the Catholic church - I would even say that it is a scathing indictment.  Bishops and priests are shown as members of an old boys' club, living it up - boozing, feasting and sexually abusing children, and then covering up each other's crimes.  Those devotees who are capable of clearly distinguishing between right and wrong, even as they are trying to hang on to to the old traditions and rituals, are left having to live with the existential despair of doubting the existence of God.

0393327655|1.0|Sam Harris is terrified. He worries that human civilization is racing toward the brink of self-destruction on the fuel of religious fanaticism. Nothing less than total eradication of the religious impulse can stave off this horrible fate. This is the message of his book The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason.    What is this faith that instills such dread? It is religious faith of almost any kind. Harris's main targets are Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, though his harshest criticism is directed at Christians, and not only fundamentalists. Harris attacks the whole spectrum of Christian belief. At one end are the literalists, the fundamentalists--exclusive, intolerant, irrational, superstitious, and \\"subservient to tradition\\" (p. 21)--whose action-guiding beliefs are irrational and dangerous. At the other end are liberals--the enablers, the ultra-tolerant who cannot make a clean break with religious belief. Their toleration of irrational traditional believers is a betrayal of reason.    The Consequences of Faith. Chapter 1, \\"Reason in Exile,\\" describes the irrationality and practical dangers of religious faith. Chapter 2, \\"The Nature of Belief,\\" stresses the need for evidence in grounding belief. These chapters prepare readers for substantive charges made against believers in the rest of the book.    Chapter 3 is a potpourri of potshots against Christianity. Harris protests that countless horrifying consequences \\"have arisen, logically and inevitably, out of Christian faith\\" (106). From historical data he fashions distorted descriptions of witch hunts, inquisitions, Crusades, and of an anti-Semitism that is \\"intrinsic to Christianity\\" (92). He even blames the Nazi Holocaust on medieval Christianity (101). He derides the Bible for its discrepancies, the idea of a virgin birth, neuroses about sex, and for its miracles and prophecies. These specious allegations amount to little more than acrimonious assertion.    Chapter 4, \\"The Problem with Islam,\\" is unoriginal. Yes, the tenets of Islam do seem to arouse and embolden terrorists of Islamic persuasion, the common good is threatened by Islamo-fascist terrorism, and the political establishment in America is naive about the root causes of this terrorism; but Harris's calculation of this threat is skewed. There are sincere Muslims who disavow Islamic terrorists. Harris draws unqualified conclusions from atypical examples of religious zeal. Such hasty generalizations are especially obvious, even obnoxious, in this chapter. While hammering Islamic belief, Harris shifts to a more general conclusion: \\"As I argue throughout this book, we have a problem with Christianity and Judaism as well. It is time we recognize that all reasonable men and women have a common enemy. It is an enemy so near to us, and so deceptive, that we keep its counsel even as it threatens to destroy the very possibility of human happiness. Our enemy is nothing other than faith itself\\" (131).    Chapter 5 warns against the thought that religion's influence in the West is benign, in comparison with Islam's more visible repercussions (153). The risky courtship between the United States and Israel is religiously motivated (153-54). Private faith has rudely invaded the public square; for example, judge Roy Moore's antics over exhibition of the Ten Commandments in his court, John Ashcroft's religiously motivated behavior as attorney general, the inordinate influence of special interest groups with a religious agenda, the intrusion of faith in policy making through Bush administration consultants and nominees, and the overtly religious basis that congressmen and judges have for political and legal decisions that they make. Harris prefers a vision of life where peace-loving perpetrators of \\"victim-less crimes\\" are spared prison sentences, and where stem cell research proceeds unhindered by religiously based concern for the unborn. He frets that we are on the verge of becoming a theocratic society (156), which \\"should be terrifying to anyone who expects that reason will prevail in the inner sanctums of power in the West\\" (157).    The Immorality of Faith. Harris forgets that we live in a democracy, where people, reasonable or not, have a say in how our country will be governed. Our representative government must represent religious believers no less than their \\"cultured despisers.\\" If voters and elected officials are irrational, there's not much that elitists like Harris can do about it, without resorting to fascism. It's not at all clear that Harris has taken that option off the table. Harris understands that the utter privatization of Christian faith is incompatible with Christian belief. He can't be very optimistic that Christian influence will deteriorate to a sufficient degree.    Harris recognizes that religious belief is the ground of moral conviction for a host of individuals. Having dispensed with religious faith, he is desperate to find a rational basis for a secular morality, but he realizes that many of the nonreligious have opted for a sentimental relativism that can hardly be a ground for our moral intuitions. In chapter 6, \\"A Science of Good and Evil,\\" he devises a scheme to ground ethical principles that floats free of religion without collapsing into moral relativism. This scheme must yield just the content Harris prefers, with none of the onerous sin-mongering rules that accompany a religiously based morality. What he proposes is sketchy, hopeful, and ultimately incoherent.    As if to ease his own argumentative burden, he scorns the Christian ethic, and includes Christianity in the following indictment: \\"Once a person accepts the premises upon which most religious identities are built, the withdrawal of his moral concern from those who do not share these premises follows quite naturally\\" (176-77).    If Harris sincerely thinks that Christianity's foundational beliefs entail withdrawal of moral concern for non-Christians, he needs to demonstratethat, beginning with the New Testament, in which Jesus teaches His disciples to love their enemies and their neighbors as themselves. Has Harris bothered to read Jesus' famous Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus commends the peacemakers and the poor in spirit?    Harris does not accuse Christians of hypocrisy, of acting inconsistently with their professed beliefs. He assumes, rather, that the bad behavior of professed believers is a natural concomitant to irrational beliefs at the core of their professed faith; they are misguided zealots in both belief and action. He ignores the possibility that zealots are either hypocrites or pretenders to Christian faith, whose behavior departs from the counsel of Scripture.    Harris repeatedly commits the logical fallacy called ignoratio elenchi (\\"missing the point\\"), where the premises of his argument support a conclusion that is only vaguely related to the very different conclusion he draws. Here, the conclusion implied in his argument is that some self-described religious believers either are hypocrites or are not true believers. Harris's premises have no bearing on the truth or rationality of Christian beliefs.    Harris reasons that hell is an invention by Christians to justify indifference and hatred toward others. The New Testament, however, teaches that God desires that none should perish. Harris thinks it morally abhorrent to believe in and teach about the existence of hell. It was an act of compassion, however, for Jesus to warn that there is a hell to avoid, and it was an act of mercy for Him to point the way to avoid it. That way cost Jesus His own life. As He said Himself, \\"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends\\" (John 15:13 ESV).    It would be morally abhorrent for anyone who believes the Christian doctrine of hell to ignore the plight of those destined for destruction. So it comes down to this question: Is there any good reason to believe in the reality of hell? Harris believes there isn't, but he doesn't even attempt to argue that the doctrine is false or that it's irrational to believe that it's true; rather, he argues that if it's unreasonable to believe there's a hell, then it's morally dubious to threaten nonbelievers with the prospect of ending up there. Ignoratio elenchi, once again.    Harris seldom considers the rationality of fundamental Christian beliefs in any direct way. He makes himself judge of what is reasonable and what is not, and agrees with Christopher Hitchens's question-begging dictum: \\"What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence\\" (176). This sword cuts both ways.    The Product of Faith. Let's examine an argument Harris does make--the argument from evil against the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent Deity. Harris's version of the argument may be formulated step-wise as follows (172-73):                 1.      Theism entails that \\"God created the world and all things in it.\\"                 2.      Smallpox, plague, and filariasis are examples of things in the world.                 3.      Therefore, God created smallpox, plague, and filariasis.                 4.      If God created smallpox, plague, and filariasis, then God is the cause of smallpox, plague, and filariasis.                 5.      Anyone who causes the existence of things like smallpox, plague, and filariasis is morally deficient.                 6.      Therefore, the God of theism is morally deficient.    In the paragraph that follows, Harris writes: \\"The problem of vindicating an omnipotent and omniscient God in the face of evil...is insurmountable\\" (173). Harris dismisses two replies to this problem. The first is that \\"the Creator...is beyond human judgment\\" in these matters (173). This defense fails, says Harris, because the same Creator is \\"consistently ruled by human passions,\\" according to the Abrahamic tradition (173). He ignores the legitimacy of anthropomorphism, that is, speaking of God's divine passions in human terms. Harris uses emotionally charged language to characterize the passions associated with God's relation to the human community: \\"jealousy, wrath, suspicion, and the lust to dominate\\" (173). The God of the Bible cannot be accused of any \\"lust to dominate.\\" On the contrary, the scope of human freedom and its exercise is truly remarkable in light of God's sovereignty. God's self-imposed restraint of power is best explained by God's patience toward a human community bent on moral corruption. The other passions Harris mentions are appropriate under certain conditions and need not be understood as being the same as changing human passions.    Second, theists often deal with the problem of evil by appealing to \\"notions of free will and other incoherencies,\\" says Harris. In a lengthy footnote Harris argues that the concept of human freedom is incoherent (262-64). He stipulates a bizarre criterion for the conceptual coherence of free will: \\"No one has ever described a manner in which mental and physical events could arise that would attest to its existence\\" (264). Human freedom is best attested, however, not by a model of mind/body interaction, but by our knowledge of ourselves as agents who act freely and with moral responsibility. Harris must deny this, of course, but his denial creates special difficulties for him because he wants to provide for genuine moral responsibility on secular grounds.    The Alternative to Faith. Harris's promise to show that we can dispense with the illusion of free will and still explain morally responsible behavior (263) is empty. When he finally states in a direct way his own fundamental moral principle, it comes down to this: \\"To treat others ethically is to act out of concern for their happiness and suffering\\" (186). Notice, however, this statement only masquerades as a basic moral precept. Ethics is a normative discipline. An ethical theory centered on human happiness must make sense of the obligation to act for human happiness. We may feel that loving others is conducive to happiness (187), and it may be conducive to happiness. Certainly, we do naturally want to be happy (whatever precisely that means). But so what? Why think that anyone is entitled to happiness, so that others are morally obligated to act for their happiness?    According to Harris, to be \\"loving and compassionate\\" (191) means doing for others those things that result in pleasurable feelings for them and for ourselves. Harris thinks this sort of behavior makes one ethical, but it doesn't. He does not explain why it would be unethical not to act in these ways. He says, \\"The point is that the disposition to take the happiness of others into account--to be ethical--seems to be a rational way to augment one's own happiness\\" (192). Here we have mere assertion and no account of ethical normativity. We might agree that it would be foolish to act contrary to Harris's principle. In what sense, however, would it be unethical?    In short, Harris misses the whole point of ethical theory--but that's not all. Remember, he also repudiates human freedom--all we really have are dispositions, not choices. If our ineluctable dispositions are to act or not act for the happiness of others, however, there cannot be anything morally commendable or objectionable about any of our actions, since we could not have done otherwise. Harris's position is hopelessly confused.    Things don't improve for Harris in the final chapter, \\"Experiments in Consciousness.\\" Here he attempts to explain how a human community devoid of religious belief could still be \\"spiritual.\\" For him, spirituality is reducible to the transformation of consciousness to achieve \\"a more profound response to existence\\" (204). Consciousness is reducible to physical activity occurring in the brain, and the self is reducible to neurons that see, hear, taste, touch, think, and feel (212). Harris mixes an exotic concoction that is three parts philosophicaland scientific naturalism and two parts Eastern mysticism. He embraces Buddhism for its insight into the nature of spirituality and unity, and its development of neurophysiological machines and technologies that are conducive to spiritual attunement.    How can Harris allow any kind of spirituality and condone apparently religious practices when he demands \\"the end of faith\\"? Because the spirituality he permits is purely a matter of experience, and \\"there is nothing we need to believe to actualize it\\" (219). And so we come to the ironic conclusion: \\"Mysticism is a rational enterprise. Religion is not\\" (221).    Harris's book is the product of a bizarre logic. First, he argues that religious believers inflexibly shun evidence and cling in ignorance to utterly irrational beliefs; but his own book is short on the objective evaluation of evidence on all sides of the issues he confronts. Second, he thinks any attempt to persuade believers with evidence is hopeless; yet he imagines that his book will somehow help to stem the tide of fanaticism. Does Harris expect believers to shed their faith willingly, or does he condone the divestment of their faith by force? That would be truly apocalyptic.    Harris avoids a balanced appraisal of forces shaping Western culture. He is altogether silent about the prevalence of antireligious bias in the media and in the nation's universities, where social influence is unmatched. His diatribe against faith presents a spectacle of alarmist folly equal to what he attributes to religious believers. He's right about one thing, though: \\"This world is simply ablaze with bad ideas\\" (224). Let's hope that some day Harris will lower his voice to a more conversational and less paranoid level, and listen carefully to the challenges confronting his own position.

B001TODCII|1.0|After hearing so many good things about this movie, I was very excited to finally get to see it.  I was terribly disappointed almost immediately.  Starting with the way they really drive home the fact that he doesn't have a good relationship with his daughter, to the laughable action and ending, there wasn't even one aspect of this film that I liked.  This movie felt like the dialogue was taken right out of an 80's action film.  20 years ago that was fine, but now we need better.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain has vaulted itself into my top ten (five?) reads in 44 years. After finishing it, I purchased a slew of copies which I gifted to good friends - fellow book lovers - who had equally enthusiastic reviews. This book is wonderful.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|From the title of this CD I was really hoping for a somewhat autobiographical vein to it, like Sally Rose was. However that is not the case. I have been a fan from the start and the production has a somewhat nostalgic flair with Brian Ahern at the helm. But that only made me want to here a more introspective take all the more. The self penned tunes are easily the best. Emmylou does herself a disservice by most of the covers she included. It is overall a very good CD, but it only leaves me yearning for what it could have been. CRW

0316096199|4.0|Benjamin Franklin once said \\"All human situations have their inconveniences. We feel those of the present but neither see nor feel those of the future; and hence we often make troublesome changes without amendment, and frequently for the worse.\\"  This quote surprisingly sets the tone for Alice Sebold's first work, Lucky.  In this compelling memoir, Lucky, Sebold describes a traumatic event in her life and how society unconsciously judges raped victims in order to portray the life and the effect her rape had on her. With in-depth and graphic depictions, Sebold outdoes herself as she details specific scenes that get the reader involved emotionally and psychologically.  The reader learns the depth of the author's soul and gets hooked into the truth and realism. Many can relate to Sebold's traumatic incident on a personal level, and understand the reality and ease in which a life can be changed forever. Such changes cause Sebold to reassess her life and limits, and to make horrible decisions.  For instance, her addiction to meaningless sex leads to her so-called \\"loss of virginity\\" in order to feel like a normal girl. Another way that she tries to avoid the pain, and to ultimately rid her family of the pain and frustration they feel is through humor.  However, readers see that even though she makes jokes, things sadly can never actually go back to the way they were. Sebold later comprehends that if she doesn't show fear, then her family can feel comfortable.  Overall, this memoir is one of those books that you can not put down as you feel that you are with Alice through her experience of rape. You become attached to Alice, marvel at her success towards the end of the novel, and understand how Alice was truly \\"Lucky.\\"
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|Offbeat topic and characters are appealing, but the dialogue itself is kind of corny.  And the acting kind of hammy.  Maybe okay as a mildly amusing distraction to fill some time-- if there is nothing better to watch.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie. While my expectations were low, I was at least hoping that I wouldn't hate it.   All the Indy films have dealt with some far fetched action scenes, but they have always been at least somewhat plausible, if not highly unlikely.  This movie is just too over the top. Surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge, thrown miles away, and then jumping out without a scratch? Didn't anybody working on the movie, raise their hand and say, \\"Hey this isn't even remotely possible\\"?  Swinging on vines, and catching up to a speeding vehicle? Going over three waterfalls in a vehicle with a broken jagged windshield, and nobody falls out or gets hurt, or even loses their hat?  I could go on, but those were probably the most aggravating scenes. It was good to see Indy in action again and hear the theme music again, but unfortunately the story just didn't work. I enjoy sci-fi stuff, but it just didn't fit or work in this movie. The ending made no sense, with a bunch of dead alien skeletons all sitting in chairs for some reason, return a missing skull, and they come alive, morph into one, explode a woman's head with too much knowledge, and then disappear into another dimension? WTF?   The new characters were one dimensional and boring for the most part, the jokes were stale and predictable, and the movie just really lacked something the previous 3 movies had.
0385340575|5.0|Gone Tomorrow is exactly what Child fans needed after last year's disappointing Nothing to Lose. This is Reacher at his best -- first-person perspective, tight plot and another impossible situation only Reacher can handle.    I've been a big fan since Killing Floor, and I've read all but this and Nothing to Lose twice. Child is without a doubt the most exciting storyteller working in the thriller genre, and he always hooks me. Gone Tomorrow grabbed me in paragraph one and didn't let go until the final page-turn.     The only negative thing I could say is I might have liked a little more introspection on Reacher's part. With first-person perspective we're inside his head, so it would have been great to get an update on some of the personal issues he faced in Bad Luck and Trouble, for example. Maybe next year?

The only negative thing to say about this toy at this time is that the longer part of the Longshot does regularly \\"chew up\\" the bullets as the are being chambered.  This leads to a jammed toy & torn up bullets.  :(  It is much lighter to carry around than the Nerf Vulcan that his brother has.

0070511136|5.0|I read this book because I was referred to it by a top salesman of expensive equipment.    This book is easy to read, and it makes some cogent arguments for abandoning the conventional wisdom regarding sales, ie that a big ticket sale is handled in the same way as a small sale.      To my great joy, the model proposed by Rackham, and the Huthwaite Group, sits very well with me.  The model looks at the SPIN process. S = Situation questions, P = the Problem the client is experiencing, I= the Implications of the problem, and N = the Needs Payoff for the client.    The undergirding idea  that comes through every page is that if we look after the clients interests first, and assist the client to see the implications of their problem, then we are in a much better position to have our solution accepted.    Dealing with Objections, closes of various flavours, and other skills which succeed in small sales are driven, by evidence, out of the big ticket sale transaction.    I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is missing the mark in big ticket sales, or who is looking to increase their hits over misses.
0470449748|5.0|Crammed for the GMAT in 4 weeks and got a decent score - 720. Disclaimer: these are my opinions and impressions of the study guides and CATs that I took. Other people may have different experiences.    Reviews on the study guides I used:  - Official Guide (OG):  5 stars. My advice is to go with the original. Other study guides strive to have a similar look/feel to the GMAT. The questions in the OG don't just have a similar look/feel, they have EXACTLY the same look/feel as the GMAT because they are written by the same people who administer the GMAT.  - Kaplan (Premier Program):  4 stars. Excellent math and verbal review, a lot of supporting online material. I bought this after finding out that the Barron's math review didn't cover some of the types of math problems that I encountered. I read that there were a lot of mistakes in the math section but I didn't see any issues that you couldn't easily decipher. I understand and agree that proof readers should catch these errors before publishing but for review and practice, it serves its purpose. Bonus for the amount of online support material that comes with the purchase of the book.  - Barron's:  2.5 stars. Decent overall study guide. I used it for the math review which covered about 95% of the math material I encountered in the GMAT. I didn't even glance at the verbal review sections based on other reviews I read prior to studying. The AWA tips are irrelevant, at best.    Reviews on the practice CATs that I took:  - Official GMAT practice CATs:  5 stars. These are what you should gauge your pace and performance on. There are no other tests that have the pace and feel of the original. The only problem is that you only have access to the two tests from MBA.com. The good thing is that you can take each one more than once and get mostly different questions the second time around.  - Kaplan's:  4 stars. This is the only test that came close in feel to the official practice CATs from MBA.com. However, the math section is still much faster than the real GMAT, for me at least. I finished the math section with over 10min to spare but was short on time on all practice and real GMAT CATs. My score was about 80pts lower than the average I was getting on the official CATs; I've read that Kaplan CATs typically score 100pts low. Unlike the official GMAT CATs, the Kaplan CATs give you the exact same questions the second time around. Not a big deal though because you have access to 5 CATs (4 on the CD-ROM and 1 online).  - Barron's:  2.5 stars. This CAT was awful. I made the mistake of taking this CAT first to determine my study plan. The math section is significantly easier than the real GMAT so don't trust your pace or score if you crush this.  - Princeton Review:  2 stars. Another awful CAT. The math section was also far too easy compared to the real GMAT. Math questions have a completely different feel to them. I spent 5 minutes on an accounting question that asked for the % of a fraction of a % of a portion of a % of a fraction; you will never get a question like this in the real GMAT, as far as my experience goes, at least. Same goes for verbal; some questions seemed to test my limerick skills rather than typical verbal questions.
0307341569|4.0|There are some important points to know before choosing to read this book:    1. There is rather graphic violence to animals.  2. The point of view switches from first to third person and back in alternating chapters.  3. The main character has some pretty serious flaws and is not entirely likable.    I mention these points because I know they are absolute obstacles for some readers. For those who get past them, the novel is the story of a murder that took place in the '80s during the height of the scare over satanic cults and ritualistic murders. During that time, the Day family lost three members in an apparent ritualistic murder. Libby Day, who was just a young girl at the time, managed to escape and to testify that her brother Ben, then 15, was the killer. Now, years later, Libby, who has managed to survive from donations made by sympathetic strangers, finds her money running out and responds to a request to speak for money to the Kill Club, a group of true-crime fanatics, many of whom believe that Ben is innocent. Libby soon realizes that she can make money interviewing the people involved in and around the crime on behalf of the members of the Kill Club; after all, Libby can gain access they can't.    For my tastes, the book has too much going on and therefore is not able to deal with all of it well. Author [[ASIN:B0028N729O Gillian Flynn]] seems to have a fascination with women who are morally lacking, and certainly Libby fits this bill, but there is not all that much exploration of Libby's nature. Obviously, losing one's family can have an effect, and we know from the start that's what happened. Nor does Libby particularly grow (in any direction) during the story. Another aspect, that of the hysteria over ritualistic satanic abuse, receives a superficial treatment. There is mention of the [[ASIN:B00007G1VS the McMartin Preschool]] case, and there's even a veiled allusion to the interrogation techniques that helped children come up with false allegations. Butthe author does not choose to explore those aspects all that much. Even the mystery at the heart of the story--who really killed the Days--is unsatisfying from a whodunit standpoint. Yes, there are references throughout the book so that the ending isn't completely deus ex machina, but it does come close, especially with the manner of revelation.    So if the book has all these problems, why four stars? I had a friend read this book before me, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. I find it somewhat average, and four stars seems to be the average of our two responses.
B001TODCII|5.0|A word of advice: if you plan to kidnap a man's daughter in order to sell her into forced prostitution, make sure that the father is not a trained professional. Or else, he'll hunt you down and kill you. That is the primary storyline of \\"Taken,\\" a fascinating, action-packed thrill ride about one man's search for his kidnapped daughter. Liam Neeson, one of our greatest actors, proves his action mettle, taking out one thug after another, while also showing tender love for his daughter, the reason he goes on a rampage.

B00008S2VG|1.0|\\"American Life\\" is 11 tracks of tactless, \\"serious\\", (and for the most part) straight-faced pop songs of Madonna whining about her enormously petty set backs over the past 20 years. Namely, poor reception to her god awful \\"Swept Away\\" movie, her annoyance with the shallow entertainment industry, and how dissatisfied she is with her wealth.     Are you f---ing kidding me? This is easily the most irritatingly naive and downright disturbing collection of lyrics I've ever read. Who the hell sympathizes with this kind of bullplop? Who could even TOLERATE this sort of delusional whining from one of the biggest, richest, pop stars of the past 20 years!? The fact that ANYONE could be so horrifyingly arrogant as to entitle this dung \\"American Life\\" in a post-9/11 America is jaw dropping - and I reacted this way as someone barely even affected by 9/11! It's truly amazing.    Oh, and the music is lifeless, too. Kinda takes a sideline to the lyrics, though.

But i dont think he would rap with t.i. i understand that his songs might be dated and needed a reboot. But they should have put the game or dr. dre on the album. More west coast artist. Although snoop is on the album its not enough comparing that half of the artist on the album are southern artist. But this is still a great album the production although is not original beats from the orignal song it is still good production and you also have bone thugs n harmony which is one of the album's highlights. Regardless if you are a 2pac fan you are getting this album anyway and i guarantee that there isn't that you can really dissapointed.

B0018YIFEK|4.0|\\"We are all, beholden to our parents-the question is, how much?\\" This question drives the entire novel, as 13 year old Anna soon files legal emancipation for medical purposes; in other words, the right to her own body because, \\"no one can make you donate an organ if you don't want to.\\"  I found My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult superb, page-turning, and heartbreaking because of its stunning issue, author's style of writing, and the characters developed.   The topic of this novel reveals one of a kind. Anna is a perfect genetic match, when Kate ends up in the hospital for treatment, Anna does too. This issue broke my heart; not only because it is the first time I had been introduced to it, but because it grasps all concepts of human nature. Was it fair for the Fitzgeralds to develop a designer baby, Anna, just to use her? The topic allows further insight to this issue, and a careful outlook on the family's perspective.   Picoult's style of writing drives me to turn every page, waiting to uncover another image or be blown away from such a powerful sentence. My favorite line: \\"See, unlike the rest of the free world, I didn't get here by accident. And if your parents have you for a reason, then that reason better exist. Because once it's gone, so are you.\\" Picoult's interesting style technique: each chapter is narrated by a different character-revealing a different viewpoint. The best example: Anna places a front when talking with Campbell and Sara, however, her chapters reveal personal thoughts of the lawsuit.  Another intriguing concept of this novel is the characters Picoult creates. \\"We've all got our scripts down pat. Kate plays the Martyr. I'm the Lost Cause. And you, you're the Peacemaker.\\" The Fitzgerald's are a family that I feel I have known my whole life. From Anna's call for attention to be placed first, to Sara's desperate need for her Kate to stay alive. From Jesse's loss of purpose, to the heartbreak of a sister's relationship. Picoult demonstrates thisdysfunctional family's attempt to maintain a `normal' lifestyle.  This novel is one that I found hard to put down, especially with the unexpected ending. I recommend My Sister's Keeper to every audience not only to become educated on such a unique topic, but to grasp the carefully crafted language. A novel to remember; flawless from beginning to end.

I thought I had it in my \\"save for later\\" list while I contemplated buying it, I placed an order for some other items and it showed up. Well, the two other cds I bought haven't gotten any love whatsoever because I've been playing 'We Sing, We Dance' continuously. And I'm not the type to do that. I can wear of a cd fairly quickly. But I find myself listening to this cd constantly... endlessly. I guess it's becaise of how individual each song is, such an eclectic mix, so creative in his use of instruments and various vocal stylings.     Simply put, I love it. Now I'm about to order his previous cd and I haven't even heard a song from it. If you're on the fence, just buy it and enjoy!
0307266303|5.0|I'm an ultramarathon runner from PHX and I've gotta say -- this is probably the best book about running that I've ever read. The author is the real deal... I raced him just north of town a few years ago when ge was wandering around the country with Jenn Shelton as she pillaged and plundered her way through local races. A few weeks ago, he returned to run for a desert run with our little group as he began his book tour. Nice guy, super compelling story that intertwines human evolution, anthropology, personal narrative, and the tale of a heck of the race which took place in the Sierra Madres.     For what it's worth, I'm not any kind of super runner myself, but I have met some of the folks profiled in the book and it really does ring true. The author superbly captures the vibe of the ultrarunning scene and some of the truly odd characters one encounters when doing some of these races. Eccentricity is pretty much a given when you run super long distances...    Born to Run is a breezy read, perfect for summer time. I dunno if everyone will love it, but if you do any kind of distance running and you've said to yourself, \\"Why the heck am I doing this?\\" then I bet you'll enjoy it.

Vanessa Davis Griggs is an author and motivational speaker who adores the power of words both written and spoken.

Her hard work and dedication has earned her numerous accomplishments as an author.  In 2007 she was awarded the Arts and Letters Award from Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Birmingham Alabama Chapter.  Additionally, in 2006 she was also the recipient of The Greater Birmingham Millennium Section National Counsel of Negro Women Inspiration Award, and 2004-2005 Jasper Outstanding Achievement Award.<br /><br />  Her most recent novel entitled \\"Practice What You Preach\\" was an exceptional read that demanded my attention and took me to church all at the same time.  This novel took me on a biblical journey of understanding the many \\"misconceptions\\" of divorce.<br /><br />  Melissa Anderson, an aspiring event planner, try's her best to steer clear of men that just haven't measured up in the past.  She is more into her career at this point but deep down inside secretly longs to meet Mr. Right.

She refuses to get serious with Marcus because she considers it adultery, fooling around with a divorced man.<br /><br />  Marcus being the gifted minister that he truly is, eventually breaks through the many barriers and false perceptions of divorce by holding a one on one bible class with Melissa.  Not only did it clear up the misconception at the one on one bible study but it also began the connection of two souls destine to be together.<br /><br />  This novel has a variety of social issues to talk about in addition to the main story line.

B000001Y2U|3.0|This album is a big decline musically from the previous Manson releases; Spooky Kid's tapes, Portrait of an American Family, and Smells like Children. A lot of the instruments, especially the guitar and keyboards could have been put too much better use as a lot of the songs sound [...] mediocre. Scott Putesky, the former guitarist left the band before the album, only being credited for a few songs. It obviously reflects the departure from the signature sound. Even some of the lyrics are shockingly bad, such as \\"dried up, tied up and dead to the world\\" and \\"1996\\", at least in my opinion. Also Manson's vocal sometimes gets very stale and lacks the right melody. However what places this album as something more unique and progressive is the concept, message and pop hooks found on the album as a whole, which probably made up for whatever it lacked when it was new. The concepts could have been ordered in a much clearer and better way. If a few songs had been added while the rest were re-worked, and re-organized and cut for the right tracks in best order that would fit the album, this would have been a much better album. Overall this album was overhyped which misguided Brian Warner into buying into the myth that could last very long as a true artist. Everything after this album is garbage in my opinion. The other albums, apart from what he is releasing now had brilliant concepts but contained bullshit content and hype, maybe a couple decent songs here and there though.
031606792X|5.0|Does nobody know how to enjoy a fun read anymore?  I don't agree with the caustic criticisms some people have.  Stephenie Meyer created an extraordinary world for us to enjoy, led us through a tale through the first three books, and then brought us to a wonderful conclusion that makes perfect sense.  What's so bad about a happy ending?  She is true to her characters all the way.  Unfortunately, she can't make all of her readers happy.  I, too, was uncomfortable when the \\"little nudger\\" dramatically shifted the story, but, having enjoyed the first three books so much, I decided to have faith and bear with the story.  Ultimately, I am very glad I did.  The rest of the story is full of wonder and dread, love and anguish, growth and transformation.  Bella becomes many things she never thought she would become.  The climactic confrontation between the Volturi and the Cullens and their allies is superbly resolved.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable story, and I wouldn't change a thing.
055358202X|2.0|I loved \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" \\"Clash of Kings,\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" but while reading \\"Feast\\" I started to get...bored. And in my growing boredom, I asked myself: Why is this series so long? Why does Martin need seven huge novels to tell a story he could easily tell in four? Basically Martin's been writing the same story since the first novel, and I hate the addition of new houses and characters in Feast. They detract from the story and merely add to Martin's growing list of near one hundred characters. This is a prime example of something good that's gotten out of hand, just like Hollywood sequels. The superficial need to extend a story destroys the original and much loved effect of the first novel and leaves the reader with an unsatisfying end to what could be an awesome epic. Let's trim the fat here, Martin, and get back to leaner, meaner storytelling.

Picoult's style of writing drives me to turn every page, waiting to uncover another image or be blown away from such a powerful sentence. My favorite line: \\"See, unlike the rest of the free world, I didn't get here by accident. And if your parents have you for a reason, then that reason better exist. Because once it's gone, so are you.\\" Picoult's interesting style technique: each chapter is narrated by a different character-revealing a different viewpoint. The best example: Anna places a front when talking with Campbell and Sara, however, her chapters reveal personal thoughts of the lawsuit.  Another intriguing concept of this novel is the characters Picoult creates. \\"We've all got our scripts down pat. Kate plays the Martyr. I'm the Lost Cause. And you, you're the Peacemaker.\\" The Fitzgerald's are a family that I feel I have known my whole life. From Anna's call for attention to be placed first, to Sara's desperate need for her Kate to stay alive. From Jesse's loss of purpose, to the heartbreak of a sister's relationship. Picoult demonstrates thisdysfunctional family's attempt to maintain a `normal' lifestyle.  This novel is one that I found hard to put down, especially with the unexpected ending. I recommend My Sister's Keeper to every audience not only to become educated on such a unique topic, but to grasp the carefully crafted language. A novel to remember; flawless from beginning to end.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins paints an interesting picture of corporate America and what it takes to make the leap from good to great. His observations are backed up by statistical data compiled by a worthy team of researchers. Covering the rapid rise and fall of some companies, such as Hasbro, and the continual rise and steady pace of great companies like Kimberly Clark and Walgreens, Collins points out the specific reasons why the company made it, and continue to make it even in bear markets, economic downturns, or unexciting products that all of need, but nobody really knows why we buy what we buy. One reason, these companies know what it takes to go from just good, to great! Every company looking to make it should read this book.

B000J103PC|3.0|After several attempts to watch this on cable, I have finally seen it all.  With that being said, you are probably better off attempting to watch it on one of its numerous cable/movie channel runs.<br /><br />The story is this: Andy (played by Anne Hathaway) comes to NY in hopes of making it big as a serious investigative journalist, but winds up taking a job that she is not suited for, and does not want, working for Miranda Priestly (played splendidly by Meryl Streep).  As Andy comes to realize more and more everyday just how much she does not belong and hates her job, she eventually tries to make the best of it by the old \\"grin and bear it\\" method.  She does end up doing better, but at the cost of her social life.  And the story winds down the predictable path about the choices that Andy must make in order to be truly happy.<br /><br />Not the most unique, but I guess it works, although I found the ending trite and borderline insulting to young professional women.<br /><br />Regardless of that, the film is a wonderful vehicle for the talents of Meryl Streep (of course) and Emily Blunt.  Any one interested in fashion will also be appeased, as it is a fashionista's dream.<br /><br />It is good for a cute goofy movie, but nothing too funny or endearing to make it worth owning.

0812971825|3.0|I read Abide with Me after reading Strout's Olive Kitteridge and I think I was expecting the same fictional approach. Olive Kitteridge is a collection of connected short stories and I think that format would have made Abide With Me a better book. Both books detail existence in a small New England town and the connected, deeply personal lives of the townspeople. The many characters in Abide with Me are wonderfully rendered but their stories run out of steam at the end. It's not that it isn't wonderful they all drifted into the story, but they didn't advance the plot. The entire denouement feels forced and too many plot lines are resolved in a quick fix.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book. It reminded me of Haven Kimmel's The Solace of Leaving Early, another story about Christian existentialism in a small American town.

Mount Olympus is under attack, Luke is still sheltering Kronos, and there are new monsters galore for Percy, Annabeth, and Thalia (yes, she's back) to fight.  The fulfillment of the prophecy is not even close to what I had imagined.  Percy makes a startling choice at the end of the novel.  I don't think I would have chosen the same \\"gift.\\"  But never fear, fans, a new oracle and a new prophecy emerge at the end of the book, so there's bound to be more.  GREAT READ!
B001U7FWM8|1.0|The problem I have with Veckatimest isn't that it's pretentious and wildly ambitious....those qualities can be assets as bands such as Radiohead have proven.  No, what irks me most about this record is that it seems (and remember this is just my opinion) that it is intentionally impenetrable and inaccessible.  It's almost as if the band have deliberately created an album that will be ignored by the mainstream; an album that is so convoluted and overstuffed with ideas that if you don't see it for the obvious masterpeice that it is, then you're clearly a low brow doofus who can't comprehend anything beyond your Nickelback records.  That's right, Veckatimest is the ultimate rock snob album for the ultimate rock snobs.  The only ones who are going to like this album are the band's devoted fans and critics who love to convince themselves and anyone who will listen to them that they have seen the future of rock.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let me try and explain why this album is lost on me.  The album is intentionally untunefuul.  With the exception of the lovely \\"Two Weeks\\" and \\"Cheerleader\\" every song on this album sounds like a bunch of instruments and vocals were thrown into a blender in an attempt to see just what kind of a weird concoction would be the result.  I suppose that the songs are supposed to be abstract; musical paintings that are meant to be experienced and interpreted differently by whoever is listening to them.  But the bottom line is that these supposed works of art don't connect with the listener in any meaningful way.  Art is something that speaks to you and envelops you in the moment.  I know that many will claim that Veckatimest is an album that sucks you into its experimental compositions, but to me that's just not the case.  The songs are an ordeal to listen to and they don't become more accessible or lovely on repeated listens.<br /><br />So there you have it.  Critics, fans, rock snobs and hipsters can and will fall over themselves to praise this album because they are more concerned with pushing rock into the future instead of letting it find its own way there.  If Grizzly Bear are in fact, the band of the future and they are going to be relevant 10 years from now, my guess is that they will have reached out to the masses in some way that will probably have their current supporters calling them sell outs.  Let's face it:  great music that changes the rules and endures is usually loved by a larger group of people than those that are trying to steer the Grizzly Bear bandwagon into the future.to praise this album because they are more concerned with pushing rock into the future instead of letting it find its own way there.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Stanley Kubrick, was perhaps, our greatest film maker. And 'Barry Lyndon', was one of his greatest efforts. Not too well received, by critics or fans, it is perhaps my favorite Kubrick film. Meticulous, slow-moving, every frame could be freeze-framed and mounted on the wall. It is one of the most gorgeous looking films in the history of cinema. Take a break from the fast paced shoot-um-ups, and settle down with this film. It will take your breath away.
1595141979|5.0|Wow...this book was the best in the series.  I recommend you read the first two books in the series - But this book would also be a good stand alone.  Most books in a series do not have a good enough story to stand alone, this book is an exception.  It has the strongest story, and the character growth is outstanding.  This book pulled me through the story - and when it was over I reread the last 4 chapters.  I can't wait until August 25, when the next installment is released.  I would even recommend this book to people who don't normally read the vampire genre.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I give this movie a five star rating for one reason. Heath Ledger's performance. Other wise it's about a 3.5. Bale's voice is annoying, the new Rachel Dawes is so-so, and the special effects are about as good as you'd see in any new action film. It's Heath Ledger as the joker that really sets this movie apart. I've seen the film a few times and every time I watch it I find myself sitting there waiting for The Joker's next seen. There are much better movie critics out there that have already given his performance praise so all I can say is that I agree with them and he totally deserved the Academy Award that he got for it.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I have always been a fan of Vampire books and movies.  When the whole Twilight craze came I was reluctant to even read the books let alone watch the movie.  Upon high praise and reccomendation from a friend I caved bought the books bought the movie and my suspicion was confirmed, . .I hated both the movie and books.  When I saw this at Target my first thought was oh great more bad vampire movies and books.  I decided to watch it anyway it was after all HBO and I tend to love HBO series (Elizabeth, Sex and the City, John Adams) they seem to be done so well.  Well, the first episode got me right away.  I loved it.  THIS is what a good vampire show is made of.  The characters are so interesting.  The way new characters are introduced is flawless.  This is the type of series where you sit in complete anticipation of what is going to happen next.  The new season just can't come fast enough.  I can't reccomend this enough but this comes with a full disclosure, . .in true HBO fashion this is not for the meek.  It is bloody and borderlines a NC-17 rating.  There is a lot of sex and foul language to boot but heck what is a good vampire show without sex?  If you are a fan of horror and mystery you just have to see this.  I've started reading the book and I'm enjoying them as much as the series.
0374139563|5.0|]The author Dambisa Moyo has the same goal as her opponents: to eradicate poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Her recommendation is to stop all foreign aid after five years except for emergency relief such as famine and natural disasters<br /><br />Dambisa was born and raised in Zambia, Harvard, and PhD Oxford University, worked for the World Bank. Her conclusion is that Foreign Aid is not solving the poverty problem. This is confirmed by the  UN 2008 Progress Chart about the Millennium Development Goals. Sub Saharan Africa is not going to meet any of the eight goals not even one of the 18 sub goals. Dambisa's recommendation has the merit of being radically different. It is obvious that what is done so far is not delivering the results required.<br /><br />Mo Ibrahim a highly successful African entrepreneur agrees that aid is not the solution, but governance is. In the \\"Leader's Way\\", see below, we also believe in governance that meets at least three criteria: one, a government that is genuinely interested in the well being of its citizens, two, regulations that make it easy for entrepreneurs to start up and manage businesses, and three, a reduction in population growth. The Sub Saharan population is projected to grow from 809 million in 2008 to 1 698 million in 2050, that is double, which is unsustainable.<br /><br />Every African country is unique and requires different solutions that should be conceived and managed by their own government and not by donor countries. That is the spirit as I perceive it of what both Ibrahim and Dambisa recommend.<br /><br />All involved in aid and or concerned about poverty in Africa should read this book and also  other ones  like \\"Common Wealth\\" from Jeffrey Sachs for an informed different view.<br /><br />Finding the right solution to the African poverty problems is one of the most urgent problems in the world. All constructive ideas should be considered<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385527802 The Leader's Way: The Art of Making the Right Decisions in Our Careers, Our Companies, and the World at Large]orld at Large]
1433502410|5.0|I'm not a theologian or member of the clergy, so my evaluation may not rank among the more salient reviews of this wonderful, if hefty volume.  I am simply a Christian believer, a Lutheran-Baptist concoction, reading my way through the Bible.      The ESV translation appears to be a fairly literal translation and very enjoyable to read.  I usually have other versions of the Bible at hand--usually a NKJV and a NET--to compare my readings.  Often, I will use an online resource such as [...] for particularly challenging passages.    The study footnotes of the ESV Study Bible along with cross references are invaluably enlightening.  The appendix contains an incredible amount of theological study material with a bit of a Calvinist leaning.    The ESV Study Bible has become my daily Bible of choice.  Its size and heft are a bit of an issue making it a lap or desktop read.

B001UE27X8|5.0|If you ever wished you could hear Tony Bennett in a small bar with just a piano accompanying him, this set is  your wish granted, on steroids.  It's Tony at the absolute height of his vocal power, accompanied by Bill Evans, maybe the most lyrical jazz piano player in history.  Neither Bennett nor Evans owns the spotlight on these tracks, each shares it willingly.  Alternately touching, heartbreaking, wistful, and just simply lovely, this is the one Tony Bennett CD you should own if you own no other.  He and Evans genuinely admired and respected one another and it shows throughout their two full albums, collected here with many alternate takes.  Bennett considers these simple, intimate sessions among his two or three great works, and I cannot agree more.      Run, don't walk to buy/download The Complete Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Recordings. It is a Magnum Opus from two artists, who had already achieved greatness on their own, collaborating in the truest sense of the word to create, as Evans would say, \\"truth and beauty, that's all.\\"

B0009MAP90|5.0|I had bought this album a long, long time ago, and I swear I've only played it twice, maybe three times.  The copy that I had bought was warped, so I had another incentive not to play it.  So why did I decide to buy it on CD?<br /><br />This is a pretty awesome album.  Dylan was a mere 21 when he recorded it, and he sounds like a veteran.  His voice is remarkably strong and angry, and he sings the 11 traditional tunes with a bravado unmatched by any of his contemporaries at the time.  His choice of material is exemplary, with such great blues/folk classics as Jesse Fuller's You're No Good (which is one of the best songs on the album), House of the Risin' Sun, In My Time of Dyin', and See That My Grave is Kept Clean.  His two originals, Song to Woody and Talkin' New York, are nice.  His guitar playing is phenomenal along with his harmonica.  Many dismiss this album because there's only two Bob Dylan originals on it.  I think that's shortsighted and silly.  Dylan did two albums of standards in the 90's (Good As I Been To You and World Gone Wrong), and those are both excellent albums.  This album can stand up with them easily.<br /><br />Dylan's debut album is an unjustly forgotten album that needs to be rediscovered.  It's a great album that is filled with great blues songs and a harbringer of the brilliance to come.

0312360266|3.0|As an avid young adult reader (I'm 20), I still like to dabble in reading teen fiction as well as adult fiction.  I picked up this book a few days ago from the library thinking it would be a fun read.   However, I constantly found myself yelling at the main character (Zoey) who is seemingly sixteen years old, yet laughs at the word \\"boobies\\" for about half a page.  Her excerpts of rambling thoughts, which were contained within parentheses throughout the entire book, were unnerving.  Around page 46 I almost put the book down, thinking I couldn't bear the rambling any more.  Zoey's whininess and Mary Sue-esque nature was more than I could handle.  However, I continued reading and ended up liking the storyline once I got past Zoey's seemingly pre-teen excerpts (which began to cease nearing the end).  I will probably try reading the next book, Betrayed, to see if the writing style became more apt to a teenagers, while also looking for a developing storyline.  Parents be warned though.  As I am sure most teens and even some pre-teens understand the concept of oral sex, I would not recommend this book to anyone under 14-15.  There are sexual undertones in bits of the writing and if your daughter/son would like to read this book, I'm sure that you would want to read it first to approve.

0593055055|5.0|Do you want to read a spellbinding book about ancient religious secrets, and a murder that entangles the secrets? Well then read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. With each turn of the page the book becomes more and more captivating that you won't want to put it down.<br /><br />The story is full of twists and turns that will amaze you. Mixing with definite truths and facts, Brown makes his novel sound extremely convincing and inevitably deceives you from what's real and what's not. The detail and time Brown puts into the book is amazing. He is a master at weaving fact and fiction so closely that they almost blur.<br /><br />The death of curator Jacques Sauni&egrave;re unfolds the mysterious path towards the Holy Grail and the truth about Sophie's family. Brown keeps you engaged by unveiling new, mystifying secrets about the Priory of Sion and the Holy Grail. He has a magnificent talent of interlacing famous works of art, religion, and hidden messages with ciphers as a part of the story, as well as the story as a whole.<br /><br />Ciphers are key to the story. Grand Master Sauni&egrave;re leaves behind a puzzling message behind causing the police to suspect Robert Langdon. This one message, \\"13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5 / O, Draconian devil!  / Oh, lame saint!\\" (43), acts as a catalyst to unveiling the hidden secret of the Holy Grail, and causes Langdon to the prime suspect of a murder investigation. Who would ever guess that just a few words and numbers could cause so much trouble?<br /><br />Although Brown constantly shifts the setting of the scene between Silas and Langdon, the story is still very easy to follow and addicting. The ending is enchanting yet puzzling. We see a blissful scene of Sophie finally reuniting with her grandmother and brother, who she thought had died in a car accident years ago, but we never see whether the Holy Grail truly lies beneath La Pyramide Invers&egrave;e.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is an excellent thriller that keeps the reader engaged, excited, spellbound, and breathless. I highly recommend this novel.novel.
B0018YIFEK|5.0|A compelling story about a young girl who does not want to give her sister her own kidney, My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult, sheds light on a contemporary struggle.

Anna, however, has undergone countless medical procedures that her life is no different than that of her cancer-stricken sister. Fighting to keep her own life, while allowing her beloved sister to suffer, Anna decides to sue her parents for her right to make her own decisions and become medically emancipated. In this novel, Picoult does a great job convincing the readers that perhaps saving another's life isn't greater than saving one's own life.   From, birth Anna has already made donations of organs to her sister without her knowing it. At the age of adolescence, one begins to question things in order to find their own identity. Anna is just like any other teenager finding herself. Throughout the court case, Anna shows her struggle and her surprising maturity. Even her dad surprisingly accepts the fact that Anna's decisions has some value to it, and he begins to support her. In order to save a life, another life will be lost. If Anna donates her kidney to her sister, Kate will be saved, but in return her life won't be normal. But if Anna wants her life to be normal, her sister's life will be lost. Most people will think that there shouldn't be a conflict, but Picoult convinces her readers that Anna's decision to comply to donating her kidney to Kate is not an easy decision.
B001IAO2QE|5.0|The novel The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is one of the best novels I have ever read. With Rand's objectivism principle, the characterization of Howard Roark and Ellsworth Toohey provides insight to the human characteristics. Consisting of Howard's selfishness  as a mean to live as himself and Toohey's altruism philosophy to control human beings, Ayn Rand shows a struggle of a selfless man not conforming to society's demands in order to live as himself.  On the other hand, a man wanting to control the human spirit is constantly working to prevent Roark to the chance to become successful.    As the novel starts, Roark is expelled from Stanton University for his designs not befitting of his current society's architecture models. And so, Roark looks for Cameron, a once famous architect who designed buildings similar to Roark but eventually got cut from the architecture scene due to his unconformity to the society's usual gothic and renaissance structures. On the other hand, Peter Keating, a conformist to society's demands is seen to graduate with the highest degrees possible in the university and to be hired by Francon & Heyer, the country's most renowned architectural company; however, Keating didn't manage it all by himself. As a design for a popular competition which won the acknowledgement companies nationwide, Keating asks Roark for help. With Roark's ability to create masterpieces conforming to society's demands, but which he chooses not to do, Peter wins and throughout most of the novel, Roark is maltreated for his designs that he does as he sees fit for the building   Seen in the novel, even with Roark's stubbornness to conform, in the end, he becomes the happiest with his achievements while leaving Keating broken due to unemployment. Overall, the novel is a masterpiece that features human characteristics in its simplest form.

Those further up the chain of command believe that they have a weapon that can shut down the machines at close range.  Connor volunteers to lead the test mission, and along the way locate Kyle Reese (Yelchin), whom the machines have targeted.  Reese is in Los Angeles, and befriends a stranger named Marcus Wright (Worthington), who has a secret even he doesn't know about.  When Reese gets captured, Wright and Connor must team up to find him.<br /><br />\\"Terminater Salvation\\", like \\"Terminater 3\\" is a movie that never needed to be made.  \\"T1\\" and \\"T2\\" were great movies that told a complete story, and this feels like an excuse to make more money.  Bale steps into the role of Connor, and gets the job done, but the performance is nothing spectacular.  Director McG has some tricks up his sleeve, including a helicopter crash that is filmed interestingly, but is unimpressive overall.  The biggest delight perhaps is the appearance of a former terminator 2/3 of the way through the film.  Overall, I got what I expected here; the problem was that I wasn't expecting much.
031606792X|2.0|This is my least favorite of the four.  I felt like Meyer didn't stay true to her characters.  Sometimes while reading, I was jolted out of the story because one of the characters did something so \\"out of character.\\"  Also, I felt like the plot wasn't realistic.  Sure, vampires aren't realistic either, but even within the framework of the Forks world, I just didn't like it.    I usually avoid the book.  I've read it only once and don't plan on reading it again any time soon.    (And Jacob and Renesmee?  Eww.)
B0029XZODY|5.0|I finally took advantage of getting what I pay for with my cable company. Prior to Season 3 of Dexter, I watched the first two seasons on DVD ([[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Season One]] & [[ASIN:B000V86OKG Season Two]]). I used to send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and Dexter was never part of my regular TV viewing until 2008. Color me stupid. What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.<br /><br />How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the first two seasons in weeks versus like 3 months PER regular season on Showtime. We often watched three episodes in one night on the DVD sets. Alas, I couldn't wait for Season 3's release on DVD, so it was one episode of Dexter, one week at a time for Season 3.<br /><br />So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is.<br /><br />Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO's [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]] fame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.<br /><br />The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this \\"stuff\\" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.<br /><br />The major plot involving guest star Jimmy Smits in Season 3 is a bit more of a stretch of reality than were Season's 1 & 2. But the acting, dialogue and well-written story flow kept the show right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.<br /><br />Add this bloody-good show to your cart. I'd strongly urge newcomers to start from Season 1. I dare you to just try watching Season 1 and then not go for Seasons 2 and 3; I simply don't believe that anyone could possibly do that.right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.

0143039431|5.0|I read this book for my AP Composition class in school and I loved every little bit of it. Not only does it do an amazing job in reflecting the hardships of the society back during the Great Depression, but it also uses a variety of symbols that just wows the readers. Especially at the end, the last symbol that Steinbeck uses in his book is just speechless. This book is definitely one of the best classical literatures ever written.
B0019NG73G|5.0|Something that is very interesting about this movie besides the number of great things about it, is its authenticity. Ron Maxwell really went to great lengths to give us a quality film. Everything in the film is precisely the same material (the clothes, the guns, places), the same settings, even the same language. The genuine feeling that this movie gives me every time I see it is the emotion. All of the extras are civil war re-enactors another great link to authenticity. Everything about this film is incredible. Truly a landmark film in the history of cinema never to be surpassed ever again.
0140186409|5.0|I read this book for my AP Composition class and it is just simply astounding. Not only does it do an amazing job of reflecting the Dust Bowel during the Great Depression, but also uses a variety of symbols in order to more effectively send the message of the book to the readers. Especially at the end, the last symbol in the book is just speechless. Read this book. It just may be one of the best classic books out there.
0307450570|5.0|I don't ever comment on books, and I buy a lot of them from Amazon. But this book was so good that I had to share how much I loved it.    I almost didn't pick up this book because it was Martha Stewart. I am so glad that I did. This may not be an encyclopedia of crafts, but it's the closest I've seen any book come to talking about a variety of different crafts. I am a very creative person. This book gave me so many ideas that my husband is probably going to be mad at me for all of the craft making supplies I am about to buy.    Oh well, so be it. This book is totally worth the money and then some. You won't be disappointed!
B000002BE9|3.0|When I was hating trends in music played on commercial radio with dreadful albums like Nirvana's [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] and Silverchair's [[ASIN:B000002B87 Frogstomp]], Fiona Apple, as a singer/songwriter only slightly older than me, appealed greatly because of comparisons I had read with [[ASIN:B000002IT3 Tori Amos']] [[ASIN:B000002IXV first two albums]].<br /><br />Being who I was back in 1996, \\"Tidal\\" had considerable appeal at the time and I felt it a worthwhile purchase. However, with hindsight, Fiona Apple cannot stand up to any claim to be anything more than an ordinary singer/songwriter. The beautiful ballads \\"The First Taste\\" and \\"Never Is a Promise\\", however, do come quite close to standing up with the top tier of the field with their touching singing and highly thoughtful lyrics. The morbidity of \\"The First Taste\\" in particular is as good as the best traditional folk songs about death, despite Apple's lyrics having a distinctly modern twist. \\"Never Is a Promise\\" is not far short of Tori Amos or Renaissance's John Tout in its keyboard work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rest of \\"Tidal\\" does not manage to live up to the standard of those two tracks on repeated listening. The opening two tracks, \\"Sleep to Dream\\" and \\"Sullen Girl\\", sound sly at first but upon repeated listening it is clear that Apple is sacrificing her personal art for something that is far too close to the kind of posturing that allowed Alanis Morisette's annoying [[ASIN:B000002MY4 Jagged Little Pill]] to become the first record to sell a million copies in Australia. \\"Criminal\\" at first can seem a passionate cry but its overblown nature becomes apparent with more listening experience, and \\"Shadowboxer\\" is worse and less intense with far too little melody for a piano-playing singer/songwriter. \\"Slow Like Honey\\" is beautiful but far too slight, though \\"The Child Is Gone\\" and \\"Pale September\\" are touching enough to be worth a recommendation.<br /><br />All in all, despite a few good songs, \\"Tidal\\" is mediocre for its genre and compromises with the dreadfully bombastic alternative rock and synthesiser music of its time too much.or its genre and compromises with the dreadfully bombastic alternative rock and synthesiser music of its time too much.
0802136834|5.0|This is the second book I have read by Alison Weir.  She does a wonderful job of making larger then life historical figures venerable as well as accessible.  I highly recommend this well written and deeply researched book to those who are interested.  I will soon be on to my third book by her which is about Henry's children and I anticipate I will not be disappointed.  For those interested Elizabeth I is great as well.
B000KN7BIQ|5.0|For any avid movie lover looking for great quality entertainment for only a few bucks, this is title for you! At this price point, no film lover's collection should be without this title. Excellent audio and video quality (especially for the age of this film) are paired with incredible perfomances by Newmann and Redford in this classic!
B001TODCII|4.0|I was intrigued by the trailers of this movie of Neeson being in an action movie. The movie was exactly what was advertised.  The plot was tight. The action sequences were well done. Neeson was very good. Neeson played the part of a father trying to establish a relationship with his estranged daughter very well. The movie kept me at the edge of my seat. I enjoyed it. The movie wasn't Shakespeare: the dialog was kept to minimum. The torture sequences were hard to watch, but there are movies out there much more violent. The movie didn't make the protag  onist a superman, but a middled-aged man with very good fighting skills.     I don't know if I recommend buying it, but I definitely would watch it again.
027303345X|5.0|I thought this was and incredibly simple yet profound way to think and write.  The first few chapters make a great point that seem very logically supported later in the book.
B001FB4VZS|1.0|Season 7 was the worst, so far. However, season 8 wasn't too far behind. \\"Smallville\\" use to be one of my favorite shows, but like \\"24\\", it has gone on way too long now. If the writing team can't hold the standard/quality, then the show needs to end. Yet, why worry about a little thing like quality, when money is on the other end. Anyways, the 8th season rambled all over the place, and not one episode was great. There were a couple that were good, but that is myself being polite. They need to give Clark the cape, let him fly around saving people- and end the farkin' show already.
B000002LGA|5.0|I remember first listening to this album when I was 16 or 17 years old shortly after it first came out.  At that time I was not paying much attention to the lyrics (English is not my first language) but the there was something about the sound and the feel of this album that made it special. Even though Lou speaks through most of it it is still so rich in melody.  Now another lifetime later I am still in love with this album. The lyrics are as relevant today as they were then and the sound has aged beautifully.
B001AVEJ1Y|2.0|The first 45 minutes made no sense .The girl who played Ahora was so unlikable.She always looked mad.The pace setting was too slow. It was like an explosion of characters showed without explanation.They kept flashing back and forth from past to future to present which made it more confusing.  It finally made sense when Nimoy showed up and told us what going on. Then after that it started to get better and it was great after that.  The guys who played scotty and bones were amazing. I am in like with  Chris Pine, he has a great body and PLAYED Captian Kirk MASTERFULLY. The guy who played Spock wasn't bad either.  But nothing will ever beat the original.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|The James Bond series is not as interesting or quality since Pierce Brosnan left.  Action scenes go too fast, and they are getting too stupid with the high-tech stuff.  Familiar theme songs that used to be the hallmark of the series have all but fallen by the wayside, and the new artists whose songs are in the movie are anything but talent.  This is the first time that my husband and I did not go to the movies to see a new James Bond film, and I am glad we rented instead of sat through this boring, disappointing film.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I heart the book and the movie . They are both equally good. Renee z, plays her perfectly,and the irony is she from Texas.(You wouldn't know this unless you listen to the dvd commentary.  Its about a SLIGHTLY ditzy,chubby blonde lady who loves to laugh,party& hang with her friends,and loves her mom even though she drives her crazy and is always trying to set her up with Lawyer's that wear reindeer sweaters.  She has a crush on her sexy boss who only wants to get inside her granny panties(played by a delicious Hugh Grant)I like him even better here as the slimeball boss.It was nice to see him get out of the stuttering dweeb role he usually plays.  And Colin Firth is awesome at this role. He should,he has had alot of practice.( he played Darcy in 1995 P & P Miniseries, which was too long and boring but he was good in it)  My 2 fav parts are when she is dressed as a playboy bunny and when Daniel Cleaver emails her and asks her if her skirt called in sick today.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This series held me spellbound!  Such a lovely story, and the scenery and costumes were unbelievable!  I highly recommend this movie for any interested in period pieces and a clean, relaxing and beautiful experience in movie classics.
B00000JRTX|5.0|Okay so I watch this movie at least once a year.Its about a dorky English guy who sucks at meeting girls and is always late for weddings.Charles has a horribly shrill ex girlfriend his friends call duck face who carries a torch for him, and is even more pathetic at dating the opposite sex than he is.(If you can believe it) He thinks he is doomed to be single forever, until Charles falls in love with an American Girl wearing a Giant hat at his friend Angus's wedding.  You have to love his friends too. Sarcastic Fi, who seems like kinda of a cold bitch at first , but once you get to know her, you see what she is all about. Bernard and Lydia who have epic sexual chemistry. Gareth who wears loud vests and love to chicken dance.  It also captures the time in your life where everybody  is falling in love and getting married but you and all the cheesy dances and costumes and stuff.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I would give this movie more than five stars, if possible.  Beautiful scenery, costumes and intriguing story line. This movie has it all.  Great acting, comedy, drama.  This is just the kind of movie that you can enjoy with the entire family (but probably more appealing to women).  I am searching for movies with content and acting just like this.  I highly recommend this movie!
B001TIDXTM|1.0|Simply stated:  disappointed.  I felt like Stephanie Meyer was grasping at anything to make the story interesting.  Should have ended the series after book 3.
B00005N915|5.0|Movie had me on the edge of my seat.  The twist at the end was amazing.
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|The album is very easy to listen to with a flow that you won't need to press skip to the next song, which I did sometimes on other people's albums.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|That Hudson is by far one of the most promising and talented young artists out there. Her voice is superior to almost any other in her age range and she has already established herself with her Grammy award winning \\"And I am Telling you I am not going\\" (which I am happy was included on the album). Having said this, the general consensus on Jennifer's debut album is that it is fairly mediocre. Opening with the stylish \\"Spotlight\\" and later with head bopping \\"Pocketbook\\", the cd quickly slows down and does not provide anything as remarkable as Hudson's talent. And the finale of the cd, the Jesus inspired gospel hym, really helps in proving my point- that Jennifer tried to achieve too much with this album.   Highlight- \\"Cant Stop the Rain\\"
B00009R6J7|4.0|This does what it is supposed to do.  I can't see why it has to be so expensive though.

B001HUHBAE|5.0|Personally, I enjoy this film more than any of Fincher's others, and I am a big fan of his. One of the things that surprised me is that I really didn't mind Jake Gylenhaal, whom I normally would not go out of my way to see. At times, this film can be intentionally slow, and you just need to stick with it. I remember a few hours after I saw this film on opening night, I was actually afraid to go out to my car. It was the idea that this messed up killer operated in the real world, and was never caught. With ZODIAC, you get a creepiness that pounds at you without your knowledge, and you don't realize until you have to disassociate your real life from the movie. This particular disc is loaded, and the extras including fascinating documentaries are awesome. I could not recommend this movie more, and if you don't like it, you're probably lame.
0345495004|4.0|The author has done a marvelous job of recreating the love affair between FLW and Mamah Cheney given the dearth of reliable information available.  It is a heartbreaking story though it may not have been Horan's intention to  make it so. I did not find Cheney  an enviable character, gifted and intelligent yes, but also basically friendless, obsessed, confused,selfish and ultimately unable to assert herself independently from FLW. The fact that she abandoned her children is  a tragic element in the story so I couldn't garner much sympathy for her as a human being. The story moves along nicely, though, and the ending is a horrible shock.
0439023483|5.0|This book was absolutely brilliant. I first picked this book up as Stephanie Meyer recommended it and I was blown away. I cant wait for the next book, Catching Fire.
0743298039|5.0|This book was extremely well-written. It was a pleasure to read. There's some weird stuff involved, but the writing just draws you in. The only thing that bugged me was the protagonist's weird obsession with a twin who died at birth. She acted like she could not get over this fact and that her twin kind of haunted her (although she never mentioned having an issue before she found out there was a twin). I just didn't think that was realistic or rang true at all. But that was just a minor annoyance. Overall, I loved this book and I cannot wait to read something else by this author.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Walt Kowalski is a disgruntled widower, a grumpy old man who despises the sedentary lifestyle his children and grandchildren live, who resents the ethnic intrusion into his once all-white neighborhood, who is angry at the God who took his wife away and the priest who tries to comfort him.  Walt just wants to be left alone; his idea of happiness is sitting on the porch with a beer and his dog.<br /><br />But that changes when a Hmong gang enters the neighborhood, hell-bent on recruiting the boy next door.  Walt intervenes, and from then on the neighborhood takes a shine to him, whether he wants them to or not.  It is a relationship that will draw Walt out of his shell...with some funny, emotional, and tragic consequences.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO is spectacular.  It is easily Eastwood's finest directorial piece, and I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it features his best performance to boot.  The flaws here are few and far between; the main flaw is that, in his quest for authenticity, Eastwood hired an all-Hmong supporting cast, many of whom aren't professional actors (and you can tell).  It's a small price to pay, however, for a movie that hits you on all emotional levels: it's funny, suspenseful, and heart-breaking.  There aren't very many emotional punches, thank God, but when they come they are knockouts.  If Eastwood were to stop making films now (and let's pray he doesn't), he could rest easily on the laurels of GRAN TORINO, content in the fact that he has made an American classic (again).
006097625X|5.0|This book provides an incredibly in-depth discussion on what comics are, why they exist, and how they are related to other forms of art. If you love comics, this book is a must-read and if you think comics are a waste of time then this book is a must-read for you as well. It helped me see comics in a whole new light...great work Scott.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|When I first viewed the pilot,I thought the hype was misleading, but after seeing bigger hype in the weeks to follow, I watched another episode and I was blown away!!! This is a very well put together series(and cast) with intense storylines and special effects! If you dug X-Files,Millenium,& Supernatural, then you'll really dig this series(which seems to be filmed close to home as I live in Mass but it's filmed in N.Y.) and it definitely has longevity in its future! Enjoy or you won't know what your missing!!!!!
B001F290E4|5.0|WOW.  Seal is one of the best musicians I have ever heard. I also have the Tribute to Jimmy Hendrix in which Seal did a great Manic Depression. Seal is very versatile. I can't wait to buy his next CD.

0156030306|4.0|Though the reading level is slightly younger than expected, anyone who reads it should expect to be touched at the end of the book.  This book shows the relationship between intelligence and happiness, as the main character Charlie Gordon becomes smarter, he simultaneously becomes happier and enjoys life.  He undergoes an experiment to increase his intelligence from severe mental retardation which was previously tested on a lab rat, Algernon.  Initially his writing is broken up as if he was just learning how to write in the first grade but as the book progresses, so does he.  Charlie continues to feel what life is really like, attempting to heal his past with his family and engaging in a relationship with Alice, his teacher.  He notices that Algernon's intelligence is decreasing and that he cannot win maze races anymore and is becoming a typical street rat again.  Charlie realizes that this could possibly be his own fate; if Algernon was deteriorating then he would soon follow.        This book is a heart wrenching tale, giving a new perspective on the life of mentally challenged people.  It allows the reader to feel bad for Charlie when he is getting made fun of by co-workers but actually thinks they are friends.  Then it is even more upsetting when he becomes smarter and he realizes everything his \\"friends\\" had done has been mean and mocking of his problems.   If you would like to read a riveting tale of a man's dreams temporarily coming true, of a man who gets to really live life, but only for a breath, then this book is for you.  This book has extreme characterization, connecting Charlie to the reader; however it is depressing and shocking.
B001TOD92C|5.0|While this movie is unrelentingly one of misery and endless failure, I found it great fun on several levels.  First, any wrestling fan will enjoy this film.  It's all there:  blading, scripting, a great scene with the steroid dealer, the school gyms, appointments with the hairdresser, poorly attended \\"fan conventions,\\" and the vast array of characters who haunt the sport.  (Necro Butcher makes an appearance!)    Second, to supplement his income, the Ram takes a job at a deli counter, resulting in several wonderful scenes.  (Note his boss, Wayne, an excessively overdrawn management type.)  Third, and not to sound too shallow, Marisa Tomei provides several nude scenes which help to take your mind off the Ram's many problems.    Finally, the character of the Ram is really unique.  He's not likeable in the sense you'd invite him to the barbecue, or otherwise hang around with him.  Yet it's not like you hate him, either.  You would definitely say \\"hi\\" to him if you saw him on the street.    This ain't \\"Rocky,\\" and it's not even \\"Requiem for a Heavyweight.\\"  I don't know what it is, but I really enjoyed it.  Like the Ram so eloquently said:  \\"Here's your baloney, pal.\\"
0312944926|5.0|Even though the book we originally ordered was not sent, as soon as I contacted them they apologized for the mistake, quickly sent the correct book, and let me keep the one that was mistakenly sent.

0385341008|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books of all-time. It's a short, enjoyble read with wonderful dry wit, an historical perspective (tells of characters' heart-wrenching experiences during the WWII German occupation of the Channel Islands) and wonderful characters you grow to love, laugh with and root for. I also love that the book is a collection of letters, so it's very easy to pick up and get a letter or two in while water boils or you wait in line somewhere.  One of my favorite characters, Isola, summed it up, \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books.\\" I already feel less engaged in the other books I'm reading now--this one was so enjoyable!
B001W63DX2|5.0|Flight 666 shows the intensity, tension, daily experience and other stuff of Iron Maiden in its Somewhere Back in Time Tour 2008. The most electrifying part of the video is the latinamerican tour. Colombian crown was the best. There was people on the line, waiting for the concert, one week before; they also get big flags.....the second dvd is a selection of 17 songs played in different locations....this is a great work, to add to Iron Maiden's library
B001FB55HG|3.0|SPOILERS    Terminator 3 crippled the franchise, but what could possibly make you squirm about the idea of another terminator movie. Let me see... how about the news that the director of Charlie's Angels is taking charge.     And that is exactly how this movie plays out. A blockbustre action movie with lots of physical stunts, no one being terribly hurt and safe viewing for the masses. Enjoyable yeh, but not true to the adult viewing of the original Terminator concept.     Lets face it, the franchise itself has just been a rehash of the same story everytime. Good guy Vs bad guy go back in time to kill\save protagonist. This was fine but in terminator 3 the scene for scene rehash of film dynamics just went too far.     And this is exactly the problem here, it tries so hard to shove nostalgia down our throats with cheesy dialogue like 'Ill be back' and 'Come with me if you want to live'. Not realizing that the real way to excite fans is to stay true to the raw, gritty and unrelenting action of the original film. I mean this was once a film for adults.     Terminator salvatino was suppose to be the answer to a ridiculously thrashed idea, but even under these circumstances we are thrown into the same tailspin dynamics of the original creation. Good guy bad guy save\kill protagonist. Only this time Salvatino rips off scenes from Mad Max, War of the Worlds, Ghost in the Shell and manages to lose itself.     Yeh all the iconic moments are in this movie... T600, the thundering \\"da da da da daaaa ... da da da da daaaa\\" music, the melting lava (cant forget the lava), the torn face\red eye, and the post apocalptic war.... but why did I feel like I was watching a Resident Evil film or something.     Maybe it was the lack of attention to detail... the special effects inferior to T2. Maybe the accessorizing. What was up with the T600 with the red bandana and ear ring. WTF. Do these machines like to accessorize?!? which begs the real question, WTF is up with these things. Were they programmed to kill humans by throwing them around. Cause that is all they did the entire film. T800 was the same, but even slower. Far from the horror they could once inflict.         Terminator: Salvatino is a branching saga stemming from the trilogy. And if exposition is what you are after then you will appreciate this offshoot direction for this reason alone. Its totally unnecessary if we were a little less consuming of something probably better left unexplored. Matrix revolutions anyone?    But even then we get tied up in a someone else's story which took away from John Connor's, who we are made to believe is important. But we haven't seen why yet. His story is reduced to him trying to save his own a$$ the entire film because his mum told him he was the messiah. Right up till the last scene, he doesnt flinch at the thought of taking someone else's life for his own. Christian Bale is a fine actor, but he had nothing to work with here, which is a shame.     Finally I want to know why there is a desire every time to sugar coat a movie with a child. Is it suppose to symbolize humanity, give it a warmer feeling. What... what is it... that we have to be bogged down with a 5 year old child. We know the child is going to live. There is no archline to explore. So what is it?

0312370849|3.0|I just finished reading Sarah's Key. The first half of the book is very well done. It tells the story of an American journalist, living in Paris, who is researching a story about the roundup of Jews in Paris during World War II and their imprisonment in a Parisian sports arena before ultimately being shipped to their deaths in Nazi extermination camps. The story focuses on one family and how the daughter escapes and finds her way back to her home in Paris. Alternating between the girl's first person account and the descriptions of the steps the writer carries out to find out the whole story of what happened to the girl and her family. It is only after the full story is told that the book begins to deteriorate.     There is a distinct link between the reporter's contemporary life and the events that happened in 1942 and as I read more, I became increasingly annoyed at the improbablity of the link between the two generations of women. As the second half of the story unfolds, the events become increasing improbable as it ends with what, one assumes, will be a love story between the writer and the grandson of Sarah, the young victim.     What starts off as a story with great promise deteriorates into a tale that is difficult to believe and left me unsatisfied with the conclusion. There are other books about the involvement of the French government's complicancy with the Nazi's, and this book doesn't give full justice to that dark chapter in French history, nor does it sufficiently develop the characters to the point where the reader cares about the outcome. If you are looking for a fast, easy read, this book will hold your interest, but it will leave you wanting more.
089898890X|5.0|There is no wonder why Modern Drummer has had John write so much for the magazine. Not only are the exercises great, the written instruction is a gold mine of information that could take many years to learn. John's gift really is being able to teach well through written material. I will be getting all of John's books.

B001SMC91M|4.0|It is apparent who the inspirations are but there has been very few \\"soul\\" bands in the last 30 or so years who have tried to keep the punk and funk together.  You have artists who emulate Hendrix, Morrison (Van and Jim), The Stones, The Beatles, The Beach Boys and so on, but when disco hit, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Sam & Dave, James Brown, Joe Tex... a whole genre of musicians were all but a memory...  People would say \\"Nobody does like James.\\"  Well, no one does like Hendrix, but generations of artists still at least hack away at it... I admire the new soul revival.  The entire Daptone Label (Sharon Jones) is phenomenal and bands like the The Gories and The Screws who blend old funk n punk together are raw and unrefined, but The Black Joe Lewis keeps the old school real while weaving in the new school.  A++ for effort and B+ for delivery. Tell Em What Your Name Is!  is only the first step to re-introducing a lost genre of soul to the masses! It's Loud, It's Black and It's Proud!
1401216676|4.0|Over 20 years ago (1988) comic wunderkind scribe, Alan Moore teamed up with artist mastermind, Brian Bolland, to craft a 1-shot Batman book, \\"The Killing Joke\\" which would go on to serve as the blueprint for one of the most popular interpretations of the Joker ever (Heath Ledger in 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns').  Although somewhat tame in today's era, at the time, 'The Killing Joke' stirred up a smidgen of controversy over the use of violence and depictions of The Joker's sadistic crimes.  One thing that stands up to this date is the masterful character study of the Joker himself.  The book flashes back to reveal the Joker's back story and provides a complete retelling of his origin to flesh out the reasoning on why the Joker became such a sadistic, cruel and brutal cold-blooded killer.  While the narrative may feel somewhat skimpy this tale is truly all about the Joker (along with Bolland's detailed and sumptuous art).
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a classic! This was one of the first books that I was able to just fly through without putting it down or wanting to stop. Lois Lowery creates a utopian society in which the goal is create and sustain what they call \\"sameness\\". The society has Elders in which dictate how the citizens should live their lives, for example, they can't choose their spouses, they can't choose their own jobs, and there are a number of rules that they must memorize, live by, and when not obeyed 3 times, they are \\"Released\\".    A boy that is coming of age, Jonas, discusses all the events that he remembers and is worried about for the upcoming Ceremony of Age as he turns Twelve. At this age, they receive their jobs for training and Jonas receives the job as The Receiver, who holds all the memories of the past generations and time before sameness. He learns from The Giver who is the old receiver of all the things that used to be, including that of emotions/feelings. He finds out that the pill that everyone takes in the community is a pill that helps suppress emotions like love to help contribute to the goal of perfection. This soon however creates a problem for Jonas and also finds out that the Ceremony of Release is that of murder; so therefore he and the baby his family took in flee to go beyond. The author shows this in an increasing intensity showing the extent of the human instinct of survival!   Overall, this book allows the reader to come up with how the community led to their idea/goal of \\"sameness\\". Also, the ending isn't concrete allowing the reader to think further of what was going to happen! Also, it showed how the human race isn't designed for perfection and our society works the way it currently is, allowing emotions, because, without emotion, there is no happiness.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Another good delivery from Amazon. This is my second financial calculator from HP. It's better and faster than my last one.
B001GKO45K|1.0|This edition appears to be a poor bootleg of our excellant Synapse Films version also available from Amazon. Apparently, the bootlegger poorly compressed it and cut off the last fifteen minutes or so. You have been warned! Spend a couple dollars more and get the full version with a beautifully restored picture.

0060763280|3.0|I think this books has some very helpful tips on how to view certain parts of your life to make it financially better. However it seems like the book is a big advertisement for his conferences. Buying the book only helps you think a little about how you view things in your life.
B0021TVYVC|3.0|This is a good album.  It is well crafted, and it is always great to hear Vinnie, Geezer, Dio and Tony in action.    Its artistic flaw is that it is just more of the same.  You won't find any boundaries pushed here.  Of course, if boundaries were pushed, someone would complain it doesn't sound like a Black Sabbath album!    Dio's lyrics are as silly as ever.  Scary lyrics for 5-year-olds.    I've marked the CD down though only for its somewhat unpleasant sound.  The mix is bad. Dio is way to forward in the mix, guitars lack bite, and Vinnie sounds munted.  Add to that the mastering has almost completely crushed any dynamics out of the CD, leaving it loud, dull and fatiguing.  Yet another \\"loudness war\\" ruined disc.    I would recommend Iommi's solo \\"Fused\\" album well ahead of this.  Vol maxed mastering yes, but at least it is well mixed.    Added to that, the DVD is very poor value.  Interviews with the band are interesting - once.  Wheres the music vidoes?  Where the 5.1 audio?  I hate being taken by record companies abusing their artist monopolies.
0307460444|3.0|There are some good ideas, and I tried a few recipes, but I wasn't thrilled with the icings. For instance I tested the ice-cream cone cupcakes today to see if it would be good for my 6-year-old's birthday party. We found that the swiss meringue buttercream wasn't something a kid would like (I didn't like it either). I ended up throwing it all away. A whole pound of butter was way too much. Then I made a swiss meringue recipe and found that kids like that better than the buttercream, but they were not thrilled. More appropriate for adult tastes.    What was most dissapointing about this particular recipe is that it looked too \\"staged\\" in the book.. one would assume that it would be perfect for kids, but after making it, it just didn't taste good.. but it looked pretty....    I will use the book for inspiration, and I will try a few more recipes. If I find any that I like I will post again. For now, I don't have a lot of time to experiment and will go back to my old standby recipes.
B001SMC91M|3.0|There are 10 tracks on this CD and my favorites are; \\"Master sold my baby\\" and \\"Humpin'. This is a great combination of classic blues with rock music. Some times you feel it is a little heavy for blues music, however \\"Gunpowder\\" and \\"Sugarfoot\\" fill in, where you could enjoy some smooth blues style performance.<br /><br />Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears are an excellent group featuring fine guitars, smooth brass and a front singer with rock music in his heart. If you are a fan of classic rock and blues, you will certainly enjoy this CD<br />[...]
B001U0HBPG|3.0|I had not seen this movie in the theatre but had many people comment on it both positive and negative. I decided that I wanted to see it for myself. I am glad that I did. I liked parts of the movie and others I didn't but it was such an unusual movie it was certainly worth the time to see.
0385340990|4.0|The entire book is a collection of letters between people on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel and people in London and Scotland.  These letters are all written in 1946 after WWII and the German occupation of Guernsey.<br /><br />The style of the book will make many hesitant to pick this up since it is not the \\"usual\\" format for a novel.  I was hesitant to pick it up since I tend to dislike books written this way, but I found myself enjoying it and finding the format enchanting.  It is difficult to write a review on a book with so many reviews already, but there are a couple of points I would like to make:<br /><br />1)  I believe this will appeal to a wide audience -- people in their 20s through folks in their 80s will find something to like (particularly those who lived through WWII)<br /><br />2)  Since it is set in a very difficult period of time, many of the topics covered are hard to read about, as they should be.  Nazi work camps, people being executed, people starving are unpleasant at best but the authors deal with the subject matter with taste and a definite touch of reality without being too terribly dark.  The book has as many light, funny moments as heart-wrenching ones.<br /><br />A very good read and one that I will be lending out to friends and family.

B000021YQV|5.0|I bought this album not knowing what to expect and I've got to say its FANTASTIC. If you are a SOAD fan this cd is the first one you should buy.  Some of my favorites are Chop Suey, Toxicity, and Aerials.    1.Prison Song-A really good song. A great way to start the album. 9/10    2.Needles-One of my favorites, really good. 9/10    3.Deer Dance-One of the best. 10/10    4.Jet Pilot-OK song. Gets a little repetative. 7/10    5.X-Another OK song. 7/10    6.Chop Suey-My second favorite song on the album. a really brilliant song. 10/10    7.Bounce-Hillarious yet awesome. 10/10    8.Forest-I love this song. Every time I listen to it, it makes me smile. 10/10    9.ATWA-Really good song, I love Daron's voice on this one. 9/10    10.Science-Pretty good and its got a catchy bridge. Spirit moves through all things. 8/10    11.Shimmy-Probably my least favorite on the album. 7/10    12.Toxicity-My favorite song on the album, hands down. 10/10    13.Psycho-Another really good song, and I love the guitar solo at the end. 10/10    14.Aerials-Different from all the other songs but in a good way. A great way to end a great album. 10/10
B001UREJWM|4.0|Perfection is something not easily attained. It's no different with H&H's new album. When you have 10 songs on a CD you're going to have those who are satisfied by 6 or 7 really good cuts, and those who are looking for 10 masterpieces. Even though \\"The Devil You Know\\" isn't a masterpiece, it's excellent work from these masters of doom.    The record is mostly slow in tempo. If there's one criticism I have is that they could have replaced one of the longer mid-tempo cuts with say, a cut like \\"Ear in the Wall\\" from the Dio Years compilation. As a matter of fact, replace \\"Rock and Roll Angel\\" with \\"Ear in the Wall,\\" and you have a better album.    Tony Iommi has always been a fan of the slow, plodding, big sound. He almost begrudgingly plays the fast songs. The riffs on this record are outstanding. I can listen to them all day. The opening tune, \\"Atom & Evil\\" is sinister in its sound, and if it was 10 minutes longer I'd be thrilled. The record's pace is intentionally slow because that's the album they wanted to release. Listen to Butler's bass lines on all of the tracks. It's like thunder below thunder; Iommi's rhythm and Butler's bass. Dio is, and always has been an amazing vocalist. \\"Bible Black\\" stands out as a great vocal track.    Let's remember that Black Sabbath is about tone, style, and passion. I think all three have been attained here.
0307460444|5.0|Cupcakes. Cuppies. Mini-cakes. Cake-shrimpies. Some of the names that have been given to this delicious little confection that are perfect anytime and anywhere and which somehow make us think that they are the perfect diet dessert as well because after all, they're so small!    This book contains many ideas and recipes collected over the years of the MSL magazine and programs along with some new and exciting offerings. Another wonderful treat within this book is that the reader is not limited just to the generic \\"cupcake\\" batter itself; there are some fabulous directions that take you to cupakes, mini-cupcakes, and cheesecakes, just to name a few, that let you think outside the typical cupcake box.     And once you are comfortable with making the treats, then you are given some of the most elegant or fun or whimsical ways of decorating these confections: piping techniques, chocolate, fondant, spun sugar (this was a FABULOUS presentation idea that is not at all difficult to achieve; wait until you see the photo!).

The book offers cupcakes that range from plain and simple to decadent and elegant; it's up to you how creative you're feeling that day!

This is a wonderful way to make single-serving, unique, and tasty desserts that you can serve without fussing with plates, knives, forks, etc.     As per usual Martha standards, there are excellent recipes, detailed directions, and absolutely pristine photography; that's always a given with her and you have to appreciate that as it is necessary when creating some of these confections. There are 8 sections of cupcakes with assorted recipes and ideas per each area.    INTRODUCTION    SWIRLED and SPRINKLED: chocolate chip cupcakes, carrot cupcakes, yellow buttermilk cupcakes, coconut cupcakes (light and fluffy!), red velvet cupcakes, rhubarb cupcakes with whipped cream, Devil's food cupcakes, chocolate malted cupcakes, tiramisu cupcakes (forget counting calories!), banana-pecan cupcakes, blueberries and cream cupcakes, zucchini-spice cupcakes, mocha cupcakes, tres leches cupcakes, date-nut mini cupcakes, ginger and molasses cupcakes, applesauce-spice cupcakes, peanut butter and jelly cupcakes.

THE BASICS: If there was a chapter that should be a required reading, then this wouold be it. This covers the entire spectrum within this book, of what you need to start cupcake decorating. It will also set a good foundation in which you could build upon with other cupcake decorating books and skills. You get a description of what dry and wet ingredients are needed, the tools for baking, the tools and candy embellishments used for these projects, how to use a piping bag, working with fondant and marzipan (these are such great mediums), pastry tips (what they are and photos of what they pipe), then all the frostings, fillings, creams, and glazes to help put your plan in action.     DISPLAYING AND GIVING: Once you've made your creations, how would you like to display them? Well, this is the section that makes it all worth is because we are visual people and to draw the eye to the work, you need imaginative and creative ways of presenting the cupcakes. This chapter accomplished that task, with what you probably already have in your home. Many of these ideas are so simple yet so strong that you realize how much impact is in their simplicity (for example, placing mini-photos glued to a toothpick in a cupcake to celebrate an anniversary or birthday, or making \\"handles\\" that turn a cupcake into a mini-basket for an Easter celebration. What about placing a simple paper scallop around a cake platter to make a dainty and delicate presentation?      TEMPLATES AND CLIP ART: The artwork used in each project for you to use by photocopying.    SOURCES: A multitude of sources for the items used throughout the book.     PHOTO CREDITS: All the wonderful andtalented folks who helped bring you the visual impact of these great baking projects.     INDEX    You will not be dissapointed in this latest gift from Martha and company. The only hard part will be deciding which to make! Peace!    ADDENDUM: I just wanted to add a little variation I tried on the \\"Coconut Pecan Frosting\\" because I was running out of time and needed to move things along. I omitted the evaporated milk and brown sugar and substituted 1 can of sweetened condensed milk instead. Then I brought the mixture to a moderate boil for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly (!), until the mixture thickened to the consistency written. Ah............be still, my sweet tooth!
0061706620|2.0|I am a hardcore Supernatural fan. I wasn't impressed because of this: I have the first three seasons on DVD and I watch them all at least twice a month each. I have sat down with pen and paper and I have made note of every instance from the DVD that mentions something about \\"dad's journal\\". I have re-read the book with these notes and have found very little in the book that corresponds with these notes. It's not a bad book at all... just frustrating when you know the show in detail and then they don't match.

0425188809|5.0|Dean Koontz is one of my all-time favorite authors.   This novel is one of his best - and he has written so many great novels.     I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. This is my 3rd copy and I have read the story at least 6 times.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Aside from the first 5 minutes, which were quite funny and creative, this film is one of the worst I have ever endured. I can't see how people are saying they laughed through the whole thing and give it such high ratings?  After the intro I didn't laugh once. The film made no sense, I honestly can't see how so many fine and well known actors agreed to do this mess! When I think of all the time involved in making a film and the cost! What a waste. Luckily I rented from my library and didn't spend a cent.
B00023B1LC|3.0|I finally watched this movie on DVD and frankly, I don't see what all the hype and fuss was about when this movie was in theaters.     The movie,basically, is about Jason Bourne, apparently a government assassin, trying to find out his true identity. There were several things in the movie that I think left it disjointed and rather confusing. Throughout the movie a government program known is Treadstone is referenced. It's hinted that Bourne is part of this program, but even in the end it's never truly explained what this program is, or how Bourne is a part of it. Julia Stiles role in this movie also is never explained at all. She's just in it heading up some sort of listening post in Paris. I also did not like how this movie was filmed. The camera movements are simply annoying at times and I don't think add to the movie at all.     It's rather obvious, in my opinion, this movie was planned as a trilogy from the beginning and I don't like movies that \\"set me up\\" in order to make me come back to watch a second movie to find out things that should have been explained in the first one and in my opinion, that's just what this movie is doing.     I also did not think this movie was all that suspenseful or really was a very good thriller. If the filmmakers had taken care to fill in some details so I didn't have questions throughout the movie I might have been able to get into it more.     Perhaps I'll like the trilogy once I watch the other two movies, but as a stand alone movie The Bourne Identity just didn't impress me very much.
B002B3D2TU|5.0|I first heard of him watching PBS they had his dvd on and he was on live for an interview. They played most of the songs from this cd.I loved it- he is an awesome musician. Iam going to buy the cd and I downloaded some  mp3 singles-Can't wait till I get the cd.
B00139W3NE|5.0|I loved the book when reading it and never got past the 1st installment because of work and never gotten around to ordering the next set after that, I didn't really want to see the movie because I have been disappointed by mostly all of the book to film movies, but I stumbled across this one today on HBO and decided to watch, I am really happy I did. This is spot on and they did a wonderful job with the images I had in my head whilst reading it and then getting to watch it, And OMG Nicole is frekkin gorgeous in this movie, I loved her wardrobe and want everything she wore, The relationship Lyra, Pan and Iorek was just as I imagined it, Now the fight with him and Ragnar surprised me because you do see him rip his jaw off, you actually have to look for it to see it so Lil kids wont be to upset by it, but it was awesome nonetheless, Awesome Book and a movie that did it justice. 100 thumbs up
0307341550|5.0|Very suspenseful, very different characters.  I say different as in not your typical heroine in distress, saved by hot guy, live together forever suspense novel.  This ain't it!  This is dark, depressing, disturbing and very graphic in some places.  I could not put it down!  I could'nt wait to get home from work and finish it!  Highly recommended if you don't want the same old suspense thriller!
B001DUJNGS|4.0|If you're not well-acquainted with Enigma, then here's what you need to realize before purchasing this album.  The main magic of Enigma, the essense of the project, are albums 1-4.  They belong in their own category--they *form* their own category--but they represent a finished chapter in a book.    Albums 5, 6, and 7 are independent of them.  Each of the albums explores a new, more-or-less impossible to describe, genre of music.  In this particular album there's more hip-hop, more lyrics, and more of Cretu's scratchy voice; but those are just the general descriptions.  Overall, it's good, addictive.  I probably listened to the entire disk 10 times in the past week; every once in a while a random song from the album would pop into my head.  I like some songs more than others, but all of them are good.    The only thing missing, though, is the emotional impact that I've come to love about the first 4 (and the 6th) albums.  Unlike the earlier albums, this one did not become forever entwined with a set of memories that associated with the music; it did not summon the chills along my spine by piercing my soul.  Hence, only four stars this round.
0307236722|5.0|Great book, my biggest thing is that I paid a fraction of the cost it was in the store...I love a good deal!
B001TH16DI|4.0|I'm a huge Star Trek fan and have been one for eighteen years now. That being said, I actually never owned any of the movies on DVD. I had the first eight movies on VHS but I never got around to buying the films on DVD. By the time I got around to considering buying the set I bought a Playstation 3 and decided to wait until they were released on blu ray.    I'm also a technology buff. I HAVE to have the latest computer, television and video technology. I'm obsessed with being super \\"Up to Date\\" on that kind of stuff.    So buying the first six movies on Blu Ray was a no brainer to me. I knew the second that I heard the films were going to be released in the Blu-Ray format that I had to buy them. In my mind Star Trek + Blu Ray = the greatest thing ever.  So I was excited about the set but then I read the Amazon.com UK reviews and I had mixed feelings about the release because most of the reviewers said the picture quality wasn't that much better than DVDs. So I thought about the negative reviews a little while and I decided I'd wait until the sets were out here in the States for a couple days before I'd make my purchase. That way I'd have time for a review site or two to post a more thorough review so I wouldn't have to waste my money on something that was considered sub-par if it did indeed turn out being sub-par. So I waited and then I read a couple of rave reviews so I went out and made the purchase and I have to say I am VERY HAPPY with my product so far.    So, to answer your questions, yes the picture is indeed blu ray quality. You put these suckers in your blu ray player and turn on your HDTV and surround sound and you do indeed get the ultimate Star Trek experience. I would even go as to far as to say they look as beautiful as Warner's Blu Ray release of the Batman Anthology. So the movies look and sound great. If you're worried that they'll just look slightly better than DVDs you can put those fears aside. With the exception of Star Trek VI, they all look incredible. Even Star Trek The Motion Picture (the lamest movie in the franchise besides Nemesis and Insurrection) looks incredibly beautiful.  Now you'll notice I said Star Trek VI is the exception. That's true. While it doesn't look like crap necessarily, it more or less just looks like a standard DVD. Nothing overly impressive about it at all. But you know what? For $89 for the whole set, I can live with that. Besides, it's not like Paramount won't release these movies again with additional tweaks. After all, these ARE NOT the Director's Cut versions of the original films so you will have to \\"double dip\\" sooner or later. And, again, I can live with that because I've been waiting for Star Trek on Blu Ray for quite a while now and am happy to have a \\"shelf filler\\" set until the definitive editions are released.    So is this the best possible release of the first six movies that we could get on Blu Ray? In terms of the picture and sound quality (with the exception of Star Trek VI) I would have to say yes. Is it the definitive edition to those of you out there who love special features and extras? No. But for what it is and for the low $89 price tag it kicks all kinds of butt and is definitely recommended for the fans out there like myself who don't mind the double dipping.

After reading this book from our public library system, this book makes false assertions as to Milton Friedman and distorts the facts of political events, as well as economic facts.  The author is shill for unions, statists, and global governance.  Milton Friedman was actually true liberal and progressive thinker, and the author of this book is a hypocrite (this book should be free and the environmental cost would be too great). One should spend more productive use with their time then to read this drivel. Watch the Friedman debates Klein on YouTube and read and research the facts. The fact is this, only a free market and free society can a nation rise to greatness.

B001RLP862|2.0|If this is your first deck of plastic cards, you would be impressed. However, if you've ever used a deck of kem, copag, modiano, dal negro, gemaco, fornier, ect. you will be highly disappointed. They are better than royals or vegas brand plastic cards, however. The packaging says that they have a paper-like feel, but they definitely feel like plastic. They are very textured, but still very slippery making them harder to shuffle unless you are used to plastic decks. They do seem extremely durable, I bent a card into a \\"U\\" shape, then touched the corners together, and it did not crease. They come in a hard plastic case, however it does not snap shut. They are poker sized, which is not stated on the box.     Now for the bad news:  First, these cards are extremely shiny. They have a crystalline shine to them unlike any other plastic card. Second, the graphics on them are standard bicycle. They are very plain and not detailed like kems and other cards. Third, these have a horrible chemical smell, bar none. Other plastic cards have a smell to them, but these take the cake. Fourth, is the cost. For less money you can can get a setup of copag, which are much nicer. For a little more you can get a setup of kems, which are by far the nicest cards you can buy in my opinion.    Unless you are buying these to add to your plastic card collection like I was, these cards are a definite pass. I paid $[...] for my deck, and they are not worth that. To me they are worth about $[...] if that.
1400077915|2.0|This is the first Alice Munroe book I have read.  It came so highly recommended that, perhaps, I looked forward to it too much.  The characters are so central to the stories that if you don't find them real, there is little else of interest.  I felt detatched from most of them and so, was just reading about people I didn't care about.  There is also some sort of cold feminism running through them- smart women are misfits and men are minamally drawn. I hope my next Munroe book strikes a better chord.

I've never in my life felt so strongly about an album. Sure, there are plenty of great albums that you can listen to without skipping over a song, and you can listen to them a million times without ever growing tired of them. But none evoke the kinds of feelings that \\"Grace\\" does. Listening to this album is like being in a perfect, alternate reality where everything is in it's right place, and nothing can go wrong. Not only is Buckley's songwriting at it's absolute best, his vocals are unmatched by anyone, ever. \\"Grace\\" is, in fact, the best album ever recorded.
0783225547|4.0|What's bad about this film? Well, the dialogue's pretty cheesy, the plot is a bit weak, and some of the characters may be a a bit annoying to some people.<br /><br />What's good about this film? Basically, everything else. The volcano and its special effects are the true stars of this film. From the first eruption to the final pyroclastic attack, these are some of the most realistic CGI shots I've ever seen. In fact, most CGI shots don't even look like they came straight from a computer. The unusual scientific accuracy also plays a part in this film, so you could quite possibly see this as a half-film, half-scientific documentary.<br /><br />The cast and crew surely did a great job with this one. It's too bad that most disaster flicks of today aren't as good and realistic as this one.

0141439513|4.0|Regarded as one of the classic pieces of literature, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice does not disappoint. The novel chronicles the life of Elizabeth Bennett, a young woman pressured by 19th century standards to marry a man with favorable prospects. Elizabeth, however, is a quick witted and intelligent individual whose strong character is too valued by readers to face a miserable fate by marrying without love.<br /> The story begins with a certain Mr. Bingley and his friend who come to stay at a neighboring state of Netherfield.  The eldest daughter, Jane, seems to be the daughter of his fancy, and after several balls and gatherings, the Bennets grow acquainted with Bingley, his two sisters, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Where Mr. Bingley plays the gentleman, charming, sociable, and pleasant, Mr. Darcy appears proud, introverted, and rude. Mr. Darcy's initial haughtiness towards Lizzy and his continual dismissal of those around him make him disagreeable at first, but through Austen's subtle description and dialogue of him, readers see him as a misunderstood character. The conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy at the balls or in Netherfield are where Austen's writing shines. Elizabeth's witty and charming dialogue challenges Darcy's cynicism and brutal honesty. The tension and anticipation Austen weaves merely through these interactions solidifies Darcy and Elizabeth's possible romantic relationship.<br />As the novel progresses, Elizabeth is faced again with the prospect of marrying a wealthy man when Mr. Darcy proposes to her. Shocked, and above all, full of indignation upon hearing that he would marry her despite of his character, Elizabeth  flatly refuses  him. Darcy must then prove himself worthy of Elizabeth's attentions and Elizabeth must realize she was too quick to judge on first impressions.<br />BY steffi castillo

It is a traditional gift I give to all my family members as they end their high school career and enter the world of work or higher education.  It has great references to what they can expect and the choices, troubles, and joy of what the future could hold.  The language is in the traditional Dr. Seuss format which makes the initial read interesting but meaningful.  It is a graduation gift that will hopefully have meaning for many years to come.  All in all, it is a great book and I will purchase again.

B000002OX7|5.0|Although overplayed by FM radio's classic rock stations 'round the good old US of A, Who's Next will never die because it'll never get old.  These songs really don't date.  As often as I've heard \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" whenever I hear that synth intro, something inside me still jumps.  The immaculately acoustic \\"Love Ain't For Keepin'\\" is one of the freshest sounding songs in the entire rock canon.  \\"Goin' Mobile,\\" also absolute acoustic, is hopeful, quirky, and no matter to how many listens I treat myself, I can always hear something in the solo section that escaped me during the last listen.<br /><br />All of the songs from Who's Next, with the sole exception of John Entwistle's comedic/paranoiac \\"My Wife,\\" are taken from Lifehouse, the aborted film idea with which Pete Townshend was hoping to follow Tommy, considered the first \\"rock opera\\" (it's difficult to even type that term without stifling a grin).  Never one to think small, Townshend wrote incredible songs for what was to be the ultimate rock 'n' roll experience.  Lifehouse turned out to be so big, however, it disappeared up its own scope and best intentions.  The songs remain, though, and in a sense, they were bound to be successful whether the Lifehouse idea was realized or not.  They jump off the \\"grooves\\" and cannot be ignored unless one has ears of cotton.<br /><br />If one wants to find out about Lifehouse, the packaging to Who's Next contains a revealing essay by Pete Townshend.  Thus, one can put songs like \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" \\"The Song is Over,\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" into their intended contexts and perhaps gain a new appreciation of them.<br /><br />With or without the background knowledge, however, Who's Next is one of those works that becomes one's own, independent of the artist's motives and/or intentions.  It's a beautiful, stunning, moving, and just plain fine collection of songs by one of the finest bands in the history of modern music.

B001UJSW64|4.0|Renata Scotto was a fine artist but her intellectual curiosity and personal ambition made her tackle roles for which she was not really suited. Norma is one of them, despite her undeniable intelligence  and musicianship she lacks the vocal amplitude to do the role full justice (the celebrated \\"Casta Diva\\" is rather dissapointing) and it is the more obvious next to the luscious and vibrant Adalgisa of the admirable Tatiana Troyanos. Giuseppe Giacommi (Pollione) and Paul Plishka (Oroveso) are solid performers but rather faceless. Chorus and orchestra are superb under James Levine's leadership and the sound excellent. At bargain price an interesting version.
B001DJ7PNW|4.0|The film:<br /><br />Plenty of ink has been spilled with regard to Oliver Stone's \\"JFK.\\" I won't add much to a critical debate of it. I think it is enormously entertaining as a movie, is a valuable exercise in stirring up doubts and passions about a critical period in our history, and is a superb exercise in style - no other film better captures the \\"through the looking glass\\" feel that anyone who has researched this topic must feel. I watch this film every other year or so, and I never tire of revisiting the dense, compelling world Stone has created. This or that aspect of the film's thesis may be outdated or inaccurate, but that's not the point. The point is to stir up doubts, and plenty of the material Stone has presented in this drama still succeeds at that.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The video transfer is a faithful and restrained HD version of this film. It preserves quite well all of the wildly different film stocks that Stone employs. Black and white material is quite detailed and has a lovely grain structure. Color footage varies in lighting and filters depending on the year portrayed and the mood. So some material is quite hazy, while other material is relatively sharp. All of it is a good upgrade over previous DVD editions. The audio is a good Dolby TrueHD 5.1ch mix that presents dialogue and John Williams' wonderful score very well.<br /><br />Extras are where I have some problems with this disc. Several features from previous DVD editions (and there have been MANY) did not make it into this one, and the ones we have are of a generally low quality. The best of the bunch is 1 hour of cut and extended scenes. They are presented in 480p SD, with the option of a Stone commentary. Many are just extensions of existing scenes, however. A 90-minute film called \\"Beyond JFK The Question of Conspiracy\\" is a making-of with critical review and interviews of experts. It admirably tries to present all sides, but the production values are terrible. A new 30-minute doc about declassified documents post 1992 is kind of meandering and tough to follow. Unfortunately it ends up sounding like a conspiracy nut (it is narrated by the editor of a conspiracy magazine) happily confirming his own previously held opinions. Finally, we have an 11-minute shot on video interview with Fletcher \\"Mr. X\\" Prouty. A/V quality is terrible and for the most part nothing terribly interesting is said. In the end, as far as extras go, there have been much better productions by various outlets (BBC, History Channel, CBS, PBS) that you would do much better to watch than these extras. The best extra on this disc is Stone's commentary.<br /><br />The packaging is a \\"digibook,\\" a nice idea that doean't really deliver. We get some pap about the movie's critical reception, and some biography pages of the director and actors. Which is to say, nothing that isn't better done than it is on the Internet. We also do NOT get a list of materials on the Blu-Ray. Kind of irritating, if you ask me.<br /><br />***********<br /><br />This is a must-own for Oliver Stone fans. It's one of his best films, easily. It is taut (quite a thing to say about a 3.5 hour film), moving, thrilling, and provocative. It caused a huge stir upon its release and had a real effect on the government, inspiring Congress to act to release documents. It's definitely one of the most important films of the 1990s, and any cinema fan should own it.<br /><br />It's not a perfect edition. The Video is good but not great, owing to the stylistic choices of Stone himself. It's way better than the DVD, though, and may be the best it can look on Blu-Ray. What is not better than some previous DVDs are the extras in this edition. So buy this edition for the film itself, not for the supplements.<br /><br />One final note: there are two anniversaries coming up - 2011 marks the 20th anniversary of the film itself. 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination. Take it for what you will, but I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that there will be a new edition of this movie on Blu-Ray during one of those years. This edition will probably have an entire extra disc of extras filmed in HD and produced at a much higher level. The film itself may also look better, given inevitable advances in film transfer technology and the learning curve of a new format (think of how DVD looks now vs. in 1997...). So \\"caveat emptor\\" for the inevitable double dip (or is it sextuple dip at this point?).-Ray during one of those years.

B000002IJA|3.0|The low rating I'm giving this album has nothing to do with the quality of the music, which of course, is REALLY high because the album contains SOME of AC/DC's most well-loved songs that went on to become classics.     The low rating is that, this is simply NOT enough music to satisfy hungry AC/DC fans desire to hear something new OR to sum up a solid collection of songs- it's just enough to provide a small taste of what the band was really about back in the day.    This is simply just an album that includes a few of the bands most popular songs, and serves as a small greatest hits album in a way, with a title song that doesn't even get any radio play anymore, so it's basically a forgotten classic these days.      This is just an album that doesn't have enough going for it, so you're better off just picking up the original albums these songs appeared on since those are the albums where those songs were better.
0440238609|1.0|Unfortunately, Pullman lets his personal anti-Catholic prejudice ruin his storytelling. If you're going to attack Catholicism, that's fine, but do it openly, don't pretend to be writing a children's book.<br /><br />Beyond the atheism, the books just weren't fantastic, and the series ran out of air as it progressed, coming to a very bad ending in The Amber Spyglass.<br /><br />The first book was pretty good, if a bit unbelievable. Lyra as a character is fairly interesting, and the idea behind the book is intriguing. I especially enjoyed the idea of daemons- as a child I pretended something similar. Pullman describes this parallel reality beautifully. As a Catholic, however, I was slightly offended by the idea of an evil Magisterium. It could happen, of course, since humans are fallible, but I thought it was pretty lame.<br /><br />By The Subtle Knife, Pullman is losing steam. The plot was confusing, and Will, grown-up and responsible didn't seem to have the same pull and sparkle as Lyra. Again, the premise of a knife that cuts through the boundaries between worlds is interesting, but falls flat towards the end.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass is dead. It's poorly-concealed atheism (they go to hell, liberate the poor suffering souls, and then go make war on heaven. Then they kill God, who turns out to be this weak little puppeteer.) The book, even once you get past the anti-Catholic rhetoric that simply drips from the pages, is fairly bad. Weak characters, flat dialogue.<br /><br />And this is to be compared to C. S. Lewis's beautiful stories of love or Tolkien's sweeping epics? Pathetic. Pullman has forgotten that a story is a story, not a sermon, and an author's first job is to tell it, not to preach. Lewis preached, but he told a good story as well. Pullman does only the first, and fairly badly.
B000QXDED6|1.0|the movie is mindless action, with tons of enormous slow motion, the cinematography is wonderful, but the inane story and soulless characters did not make me care about the film, I know its a fantasy movie, but the uninteresting characters and over abundance of slow motion made it look as if this movie was designed for people with short attention spans, Zak Snyder is a good director I loved Dawn of the Dead and Watchmen was ok, but he is not good in making good character development. Take Sin City for example, Robert Rodriguez took the source material and made it exactly look like the graphic novel, and along with that he gave us interesting characters with awesome action to go along with it (without slow-motion). the only reason I gave it a one star is because I am saddened of the lack potential the movie could have had, but it was ruined by a lack  character development and the overabundance of slow motion

I knew America's health care system was screwed up, but I had no idea it was actually THIS bad, especially compared to the rest of the countries around the world.  I was aware people were driving across America's borders to get access to Canada's better system, and I was even aware the good people of England had a government that was more willing to lend a helping hand to the people than the American one.  I also knew the relationship between America and France was never that great (though personally, I love the French and the people there even though I have no relation to the country).<br /><br />This \\"documentary\\" (or whatever you want to call it) did a really amazing job showing us, from many different views and sources, that America doesn't do enough to care about the peoples medical problems.  That's the main point of the movie, and I think you'll find yourself paying attention to everything the film has to offer.  In fact, I KNOW you well, because the film tells the problems and stories of each person (or family) so WELL that you can't help but keep watching it to find out what happens.<br /><br />The greatest part was the ending where a certain unique set of people got on a boat and travelled across the ocean to...

She also incorporates an ab work out which can easily get skipped if you are walking, jogging, doing the treadmill or bike.

0307269752|4.0|To label this book as a mistery novel could be accurated but there is a little more about this book. Larsson apart from a mistery  gives us an extra. A reflection about what a journalist must do and what sometimes he has to do. How Sweden, a country  which has been always looked up as a kind of fortress of civility and social wellfare has also its dark side. About the rol of men and women in modern society.<br />The plot has a certain classic flavour. A missing girl form a powerful family, a misterious gift sent every year  in the same day. What starts like a ordinary intrigue novel , slowly developes to a very interesting  exhibition of the writer point of view about his own country and his own profession. Blomkvist is a sympathetic hero , basically because he is not perfect and because his principles are important for him. Salander is not your typical heroine but you just love her for her strength and also for her principles.Each one come to the middle of a tragedy inside a powerful family, each one with their own demons and their own fears. I have to say that Mr Larsson has a very direct and powerful way of writing. He gives you no concessions. Everything is clear almost sharp in the story and the characters, that is why the tenderness of some situations and the reactions of the characters seem so real.<br />This is the first book of a trilogy which I am going to follow devotedly.

But I'm very happy to recommend this EP to all Coldplay fans and those who want to try out Coldplay.<br /><br />Life in Technicolor II is just as good if not better than the \\"original\\".<br /><br /> PostCards from Far Away is a beautiful little piano ditty; Glass of Water and Rainy Day are both catchy, perfect upbeat Coldplay songs fully worthy of being on a full release album. If you had to get just 1 song off this EP, I would recommend one of these two.<br /><br /> Prospekt's March/Poppyfields is kind of boring to me. It sounds like something from \\"X&Y\\" without the spacy sounds. I just don't care for it.<br /><br />Now my Feet Won't Touch the Ground is okay, another slow song; the acoustic guitar and trumpets at the end save it from mediocrity. I still tend to skip over it.<br /><br />The Lovers in Japan remix is great, the same one on their music video. Lovers in Japan was my favorite song off of Viva La Vida and this rendition isn't much different so I like it.<br /><br />One star knock off for Jay-Z's addition to Lost!. I understand that he's one of Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow's children's \\"uncle\\" according to some entertainment thing I read.

0316010669|5.0|The blink of an eye only takes a moment, as does the making of a first impression.  Sometimes first impressions are incorrect, but my fantastic first impression of Blink by Malcom Gladwell, the best selling author of The Tipping Point, could not have been more spot-on. Gladwell's use of specific stories and case studies opens the reader's eyes to the possibility of the mysterious subconscious and the effect of subliminal thoughts on judgment.     Included studies address the causes of discrimination and autism, successful relationships, police experience, and human fraud-detectors for artwork.  Each topic goes into a different detail of the subconscious.  Discrimination is generally not on purpose, but studies find that it is inevitable in the world that we live in.  Society's general views of a race or gender are engraved in our minds to the point that we are not even aware that the thoughts occur with every person we meet.  Human fraud-detectors for artwork have studied pieces of art with such intensity that they can tell a sculpture is fake by glancing at the fingers.  Gladwell also goes into Ekman's famous studies on facial expressions and expertly explains how faces naturally give away genuine emotion in the blink of an eye.   Gladwell's Blink was a joy to read and I am a strong advocate for everyone reading this book.  Now, after reading Blink, I actually think about my immediate judgments of people and try to be more open when meeting someone for the first time. Gladwell's novel is mind-changing and I believe that Blink can benefit anyone who is willing to read it.
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak, is one of the more mesmerizing Holocaust stories that you will have the pleasure of reading. Through its different perspective, this book creates not only suspense, but also a story full of strength and emotion. The story is narrated by Death, a sentimental and insightful storyteller, who tells the tale about Nazi Germany during World War II. The Book Thief isn't just about Death though, it's also about love, death, and horrors of the Holocaust.  Death narrates a story of a young girl, Liesel Meminger, who has lost her family and now lives with her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann.   In the novel, The Book Thief, the overall theme of death, bonding of friendship, and the power of literature through the different events of Liesel's life portray her experience and awareness of the world around her. \\"Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrive, Liesel would hold them in her hands like t he clouds, and she would wring them out like the rain.\\" Having the power to read heals the pain and soul within her.  One of the remarkable things about this novel is that the plot is sometimes interrupted by brief information inserted from the narrator's angle; giving a glimpse of Death's voice and thoughts, and his interesting writing style. I devour books of this nature because of the luxury and richness of the language; it is a nonstop and engaging novel that keeps readers on their toes with its twisting plot and intriguing storyline. I highly recommended this book and its well worth reading!

B001GMH8SI|5.0|this movie is a masterpiece ... it is like watching poetry unravel before your eyes and ears ... the two plus hours pass quickly like you just took a nice twenty minute stroll ...     i remember seeing this movie box at blockbuster ... but when you see the cover (picture of guy sitting on top of a bus), it doesn't look very interesting ... recently, my sister recommended it and it got good reviews at [...] ... so i gave it a shot ... i was blown away ... this movie is now ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES ...     the movie is funny, tragic, intelligent, and aesthetically beautiful from both the natural scenery as well as the story telling ... sean penn is impressive as director as are all the actors ...     again, the movie is very poetic ... seems others have gone into detail about the story so i'll leave that out ...     highly recommend it ...
B001KVZ6FM|2.0|I have seen every Pixar movie made, in fact these are about the only movies that are actually worth the $$$ to see at the theatre rather than waiting for DVD.  Why?  because these movies always are visually spectacular and have very original and captivating plots.  With each new release I kept saying can they do it again?  and each time it is Yes!  But the streak finally ended with UP.<br /><br />Here the plot, while it is very original, is boring and really seems thrown together; after a while I just didn't care what happened.  First of all, the whole balloon on the house thing is unique, but where did he get the balloons and how did he put them on his house?  It goes from one day he is being sent to the nursing home and the next morning he just has 10,000 balloons coming out of his chimney.  I realize this is an animated kids movie but they should at least have shown how he did this.  Then after he is in the air, he aims compass south and a storm comes along, but then as soon as the storm clears he lands in the exact spot that he and his now deceased wife had dreamed of (the waterfall in South America).  Again, I realize its a cartoon but come on, just put some balloons on your house, take off and your automatically in the exact spot in South America that you always dreamed of?  South America is a huge continent, all he did was aim his compass to S and poof he's at the waterfall.  Like I said....thrown together.<br /><br />Then for what seems like eternity we watch them try to drag this house over to the waterfall itself, and this is like the whole plot of the movie.  This seems like a very weak plotline here, I mean, he made it to where he can see the waterfall, that should be enough to fulfill his dream...why does he need to drag the house over to it?  What exactly is he going to do once he gets there, just sit in the house till he dies of old age?  You really aren't that emotionally involved with his plight because it is a weak premise.  Finally the plot develops into the lost explorer and his blimp, etc. which isn't bad but comes along way too late. Overall I was disappointed in this movie I hope their next one is back on track.t explorer and his blimp, etc. which isn't bad but comes along way too late.

0061673730|5.0|In an interesting blend of psychology, art, motorcycles, and science, Robert Pirsig pieces together a book of \\"inquiries into values\\" in Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance.  It begins with a man (the author, unidentified in the book), his son and two friends traveling through the Plains by motorcycle. Pirsig follows the storyline for the first few chapters where he describes the friends less as characters of a book and more as people not going into depth about their background, the motorcycles less as technology and more as the mixture of science and art, and the scenery less as mundane and more as open and freeing. Together the effect of this examines \\"how we live and how to live better\\" through the perception of differing ideals.      Opening his mind, Pirsig travels between being himself and his alter-ego, Phaedrus. He follows Phaedrus's path through Montana learning about his past life. As he walks into the school where he previously taught, Pirsig recalls his ideas as a professor, and his most common belief that the withdrawal of grades would, in the long term, motivate students. Deviation from the plot like this is common shown through other discussions on the meaning of quality, feelings versus reason' and \\"scientifically produced antiscience-chaos\\" (114).      The book delves into an influential and puzzling stream of thought as Pirsig struggles with his relationship with his son and his philosophical, Zen-like view of the world. Although Zen is considered eastern, Pirsig takes a western approach while he raises mental disorders, questioning between religion and science, and humanism. Despite major but necessary digressions from the plot line, Pirsig writes this story to hold the readers' attention, as he questions fundamental believes and traditions in the western society.  The book is neither solely about motorcycle maintenance, nor Zen, but manages to unite these thoughts with many others to create a journey through the human mind.

0452287022|5.0|Based on the portrait Dutch Mona Lisa 1665 by Johannes Vermeer, a famous 17th century Dutch painter; Chevalier cultivates the story behind the portrait. The girl in the portrait looks at us with untelling eyes and an expression that could depict a thousand words, the expression \\"a picture can say a thousand words\\" comes to mind.  With less than no information about the true emotions of the painter or the girl, Chevalier uses facts and fiction to depict one version of the truth in her novel Girl With a Pearl Earring.   Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier is a story that follows the life of a young teenage girl, Greit, who in the mist of her family's financial deficit is sent to be a maid to the wealthy Johannes Vermeer.  Vermeer was in fact a famous painter in the seventeenth century mostly known for his slow pace, great care, bright colors, use of light, and a sense of longing for the objects in the paintings. At Vermeer's Greit encounters his distasteful children and materialistic wife, Catherina Bolenesa. Greit engrossed by unique beauties of art, finds herself emotionally attracted to Johannes' work.  Johannes frustrated with pressure of selling his art to feed his growing family, finds himself intrigued by the youthful maid and her intellectual capacity of art. The attraction between the two increases as the he opens to her the beauty of his life. Their relationship however does not grow because of the distinct separations between rich and poor. While at the market she meets Peter, the butcher's son, who becomes infatuated by Greit. While she favors his attention, she holds out for her draw towards Johannes, until truth about the scandal surfaces and Greit is fired.   This novel is amazing. Chevalier's use of first person and sensual imagery illustrates the unseen but heartfelt attraction between Greit and Johannes. Her amazing ability to contrive this spiritual and complex story line from one portrait and historical facts is remarkable. She redefineshistorical fiction and I highly recommend this novel to any looking for a unique story line and intriguing love story.
B00004RGUI|5.0|I teach New Age piano, so when I heard this CD in an \\"Images of Nature\\" store I immediately knew someone special was behind the helm. John Herberman's got it. That special X factor that you know when you come across it. So beautiful and poignant is this music that it pretty much dominates my CD player. What more can I say? Get it. Love it. And listen to it. It NEVER gets old!!
0307266303|5.0|A must read for anyone who has ever had a family member or friend tell them that they were crazy or obsessed about exercise.  McDougall does a great job at explaining why we are not obsessed, but instead find great peace and joy out of our time spent running.  The stories and personalities in this book is what makes it really special.  The training advice (if you believe it or not) is thought provoking and should be experimented with if you are a chronically injured runner.      At just under 300 pages, its a quick read.  I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that loves running and/or anyone who finds themselves a little burnt out with the sport.  This will re-energize you.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|I didn't realize that James Bond had been endowed with super hero abilities since Casino Royale?     Yes, we all know his ability to bed any woman with a mere grin but crushing three grown men in an elevator? Evading a fighter jet? Surviving a fiery inferno? Was I watching Die Hard or a Bond Film?  I thought this was a continuation of the fresh Casino Royale film where we saw James Bond tortured and dragged through hell in Venice?    This is an action paced movie with very little emotion.  I actually got tired of the explosions and shallow dialogue between the main characters and really expected so much more.    In a series such as this, directors should be more willing to make a much darker sequel with loose ends, a little bit more dialogue and emotion.  It often seemed like body counts were used as substitutes for witty dialogue that characterized Casino Royale.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|This is a fresh and fantastic film that cuts through the tired old Star Trek paradigm that made for routine disasters at the theaters.    J.J. Abrams was wise to not follow the Star Trek canon established by the select few, moms basement dwelling fans that are even as I am writing this wasting hours of their life calculating the exact dimensions of the imaginary Enterprise shuttle bay based on CGI and models from the film. (I saw this exact discussion in Star Trek 2009's forums - the fools were trying to figure it out in yards as opposed to using the metric system. sigh...)    This is a fresh, fun, witty film with fun dialogue and sub plots. Everything is new down to the well cast crew and colorful Enterprise packed with hot babes in star fleet uniforms. The ship is sleek and looks, feels, fast and new. The score has been remastered and the intro is fantastic. I finally feel that a movie has been mad that appeals to a larger audience.  Hopefully gone are the troubled days of Voyager, DS9, and Enterprise.    The film establishes Kirk's origins and spins the audience off into an alternate time line.  (And lets face it.  The future Star Trek was getting boring and scary in Star Trek anyways.., err everyone remember Patrick Stewart salsa dancing in ST: Insurrection???)     Ya, not this crew.  Besides being sarcastic and willing to get into fist fights at every turn not including hitting on women and rolling eyes at each other every time a pompous comment is made on screen, the crew works well together.    I recommend watching this film in theaters and buying the DVD.  I anticipate the sequel as well.    This has to be the best movie I have seen in the past couple of years.  Finally a worth while time at the theaters!
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|This is a review about the blu-ray version of The Terminator:<br /><br />I've read here that some of you think the upgrade to The Terminator on blu-ray isn't worth the double-dipping. I don't know because I never got around to owning the standard edition so I have nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />With that said, I can see where a few of you may have a point concerning the blu-ray transfer; sure it isn't mind-boggling in any way, and it's certainly not going to win any awards for being \\"reference quality\\" in terms of high def, but the fact that it has been encoded in 1080p speaks for itself.<br /><br />In fact, I read that Sony did some extensive noise reduction on this print. So, it has to be better than the DVD. Right? I mean, what the hell do you expect Sony to do? You have to consider that they're working with source materials that are not so pristine, not to mention how the the film was shot and the stock they used, etc.<br /><br />If you complainers want the best, then send off an e-mail to Criterion Studios and ask them to strike a new master. I'm sure it'll look the best it's ever going to at a forty dollar retail price.<br /><br />Good luck with that.

B000I9B6VK|1.0|This film is quite simply the worst bomb of all time. The plot is so ghastly that when you describe it to people they think you are kidding. This is a horrible film, and if I had to place bets I would bet that in all history no one has ever gone back to see it twice.<br /><br />The plot is about a woman marrying another woman while pretending to be a man. I swear to God. Streisand plays the lead, and she is as unappealing as anything you can imagine.<br /><br />You cannot make this stuff up.<br /><br />Run, don't walk, away from this bomb.
0596007124|5.0|I first bought the GoF book but find it too hard to read and understand.  On the other hand, this book is much easier to understand and with simple examples to illustrate the pattern.  I strongly recommend this book if you have no knowledge about design patterns.

0066620996|5.0|Good to Great     By Lucero Vargas           Good to Great is unlike a book I've ever read.  It was written so uniquely, it drew you in every chapter deeper and deeper making you want more.  Collins and his team were so creative in the depiction of how to create great companies.  And the simple suggestions, rules and decisions are easy enough to follow that any company in any state could easily adapt them.     From the beginning of the book, I was pulled in.  The writing style alone was attracting, and made you believe that Collins was talking directly to you, keeping it simple yet very interesting.  The stories he related from how great companies and the comparison companies reacted to adversity were interesting and well thought out.  I could easily have seen myself being put off by constant stories from these great companies, but Collins was sharp in knowing which specific stories adapted to the point he was trying to make.  Likewise, he didn't include too much detail to lose you, but just enough for you to grasp the concept he was trying to get to.  And all the while making the reader want to know what was happening, and how did the company react.     Another part of the book I really liked was the side stories he told of his own personal experiences, other famous athletes, CEO's, etc.  It really showed that Collins was good at relating his concepts not just to great companies, but to life in general.  These stories he told were of real people facing real life situations, and the suggestions that Collins gave to become a great company could likewise apply to our own lives.  Ideas were applicable to us on a personal level as well as a company level.  I caught myself thinking many times, \\"That is true, I know exactly what he means.\\"        I felt like I was involved the entire way, not just bettering myself, but knowing what ideas to look for when I am going into a company.  I learned many key points that would help me out right now, even before I go into the executive world, of how to become a leader, how to have the right motivation, how to surround myself with the right people, etc.   I know this will be important once I go out into the working world.      I would highly recommend this book to people of all ages.  It is such an easy and good read that it is hard to put the book down once you start.  You are constantly surprised by the information that is given, but there is no denying the facts and the response that comes with it.  It is definitely a book that keeps you wanting more from Collins.
0452295548|1.0|I am a bookseller and had always looked forward to reading this book. (I also work at a large nonprofit that serves people with disabilities, so I have more than a passing interest in her story.)Boy, was I disappointed. First, I thought the book was far too technical for the average reader. I like to read medical non-fiction and when reading it I had to reread many sections - I think half of it would go over the average (non-medical) reader's head. Secondly, I thought it would be written more from a medical and recovery point of view. It was way too \\"right side brain\\" and \\"feelings of euphoria\\" for me. I lost count of the number of times she talked about having these feelings along with being one with the universe or achieving nirvana or not having a physical body. It was just too much...I guess I wanted more of the practical steps and advice. At one point, she sums up the eight years of recovery in less than 2 pages. There are some tips, but at least 65% of the book was too \\"new age\\" for me - and I read just about anything that is written well. I did not think this was well-written at all; I just have to disagree with the people who thought it was great!!!
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|This was an amazing concert with such diversity.  Her mixture of the classics, her newer material and other standards  demonstrates why she is such an iconic performer.    The setting, the music, and a fundraiser all in one.  If you are a Barbra Streisand fan this is a MUST have DVD
0312944098|4.0|OK, it's true that 'Prisoner of Birth' depends on a rather old literary device('Our falsely-accused hero switches identites with his double'), and readers who are more literal-minded/inclined to nitpick may have trouble swallowing absolutely everything. For everyone else, whose 'suspension of disbelief' capabilities are at full strength, this will be a really entertaining read! Archer plays to his strength as a courtroom thriller specialist, and adds more than a little of his autobiographical experience. Those who(unlike me) have read his 'Prison Diaries' will likely enjoy comparing the real and fictional versions of Belmarsh. Even if you aren't too familiar with Archer's background,you'll still appreciate his attention to detail in both the prison and the courtroom. Unlike many other authors (on both sides of 'the pond'), Archer is good at including plenty of detail, AND actually making it relevant to the plot, and easy to read (After plodding through Karen Robards' much shorter, but infinitely shallower 'Obsession', in my last review, it was refreshing to read an 'intelligent adult' novel for a change!) It also helps that Archer tells us more about characters, and less about their home or office furnishings, a particular sticking point  for P.D. James, and some other British authors of 'police procedurals'. This is a good departure from the traditional 'crime drama', in that the police play a much smaller(though still important) role, and the spotlight is on the legal and penal systems instead.   Archer's characters are, for the most part, fascinating, and unlike some of the lower reviews, I didn't really feel that he failed to develop any of them. If anything, he may have overdeveloped some characters/subplots while putting others aside for lengthy stretches(particularly the real villains); I agree that a bit more introspection from Danny(as 'himself', rather than as Nick) would have been nice, and feel a bit disappointed that he and Beth are kind of glossed overat times to get everything else in.   After more than 600 pages, I actually felt like I could have read a couple hundred more, just because I didn't want to 'let go' of the characters just yet!  The 'Musketeers' are all suitably melodramatic, self-centered creeps, without being cartoonish...OK, with the possible exception of Lawrence Davenport, but the payoff is worth it where he's concerned!  Archer, understandably, is also particularly skilled at the 'financial thriller', and he certainly doesn't disappoint those who enjoy the intrigue of banking, auction houses, and shady transactions! Some of his descriptions and attention to detail in these sections wander off toward long-windedness, but he manages to tie it all together, and make it sound far more compeelling than a lesser author could have(again, PD James would have been too busy rhapsodizing on the finish of the wood paneling in the banker's wall...while Karen Robards wouldn't even make the effort to tell a compelling story, and would have used the office for a gratuitous 'sex' scene, with the heroine 'accidentally' leaving an incriminating shoe behind!;-D)  While the 'financial dealings' are crucial to the plot, the twists, turns, and changes of pace amid all the jumping back and forth among the various lawyers and bankers, and Danny/Nick's individual dealings with his/their enemies, sometimes overshadows the courtroom drama. I might have given the book five stars, but I find that the Hugo Moncrieff subplot is just a slight letdown compared to the rest of the story; good, just not as compelling as finding out how things will turn out for Danny.  All in all, though, this is an excellent novel by Archer, ranking ahead of the last of his books that I read, 'False Impression.'

B001NXBRJG|5.0|The 10th anniversary of The Matrix is celebrated with this wonderful edition on blu-Ray disc.  It is a fitting tribute to have the film that solidified \\"Bullet Time\\" into the film vernacular is treated to this single, solo book  edition.  The package is fitting for the Matrix universe, the built in book is a nice addition, it is fairly easy to read without having to damage the packaging, it has some good stills from the film, filmographys of key players and some handy bits of trivia. The inclusion of a digital copy is certainly a bonus for those who care about that sort of thing, especially as it is not advertised as a \\"2-Disc\\" special edition.    The meat of the package is of course the actual blu-ray disc which is nothing short of spectacular.  The film in HD is wonderful. Crisp clean image that really highlights the films cinematography. One could go on for a long time about how good the disc is and it's special features, but the bottom line is, if you like the film and you like blu-ray's just get it.  It is a treat and will do well in any collection.

I'm sure reading it is a pleasure but listening to the marvelous voices on the CDs made it come totally to life! Kudos to all the actors.

He's handsome, and wins everyone over. LOVE Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham...he's just amazing as a villain. And finally, Morgan Freeman as \\"the painted man.\\" I liked the temperance his character brings to others. It's a fantastic story, especially if you like watching movies about the quest for the Holy Grail, knights, etc. Really entertaining!

B001HN697M|5.0|Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is the third of the Underworld movies though it serves as a prequel to the first two films, Underworld and Underworld: Evolution. The movie transports us back to the very beginning of the conflict between vampires and lycans; with the birth of a baby boy to a female werewolf, the vampire leader (Viktor) has created a new slave race (lycans) to cater to the needs of the vampire elite. Nevertheless, all is not what it seems in the realm of the vampires and Viktor's world may yet be brought down by those charged with its defense.  Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy, Rhona Mitra, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are OUTSTANDING to say the least.  All actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again! It's got EVERYTHING one looks for in such a movie: action, romance, and a great story! The plot, the setting, the special effects, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT! Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is a movie guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! With the original story told through Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, Underworld: Evolution establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a fourth movie, which I would definitely line up to watch!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!

B000FZETIO|4.0|Continuing on with my 80's movies reviews I started a month or so ago with \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", comes this classic John Hughes/Molly Ringwald film from 1986, and directed by Howard Deutch. PIP comes at a time when Hughes'teen/high school work of the 80's would soon be coming, sadly, to an end. While there are a few other works of his in this vein that I prefer(Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club), that isn't to say PIP isn't worthy of being part of the best of the group. It is. It definitley is. And now, we get the ultimate DVD version of the film. There have been others on the market, but the \\"Everything Dcukie\\" edition is the one stop shopping for your Pretty In Pink needs. Let's move on....    Perennial Hughes favorite Molly Ringwald, plays high school senior Andi Walsh, an intelligent girl with her own distinct style of clothing and way of life. She is not 'popular' at school and comes from the wrong side of the tracks, where she lives with her father(Harry Dean Stanton). She has her best friend Duckie(Jon Cryer, \\"Two And A Half Men\\"), who loves her, a job at a cool record store(before CD's kids!), and a friend, Iona, who runs the place(played by the wonderful Annie Potts). Andi's life soon changes when rich and popular Blane(Andrew McCarthy)takes a shining to her, amidst the ridicule from his popular, cool friends, among them the loathsome Steff(James Spader). What is a girl to do?.    For starters, this is a great cast. With Ringwald and McCarthy, you get some familiar faces that are not new to the teen/school genre, and many argue that this is the best film for each. Elsewhere, there is James Spader, who does a credible job as the despicable Steff. Even though Steff is the typical 80's/rich/super cool/mr. popular/slimeball, Spader really deserves some credit for not only bringing all of that to cinematic life, but for making it believeable. He is slime, and there is not one moment he is on screen that you don't feel it. He did a great job. Annie Potts is wonderful and adorable in her role, and she brightens the preceedings whenever she is on screen. Her and Andi have a great relationship as friends, and even though she is a bit older, there might be a 'mother-ly' connection Andi finds in her as well. Speaking of the parental unit, there is Harry Dean Stanton. He does a fine job, but is it me or does it seem just kinda weird to see him playing the warm dad in a teen friendly 80's comedy/drama?. No matter, he is still exceptional here. And, oh yes, this brings us to the character that Jon Cryer will forever be addressed as even when he is in his 80's. The one and only Duckie. Cryer has done some great comedic work on his sitcom, but Duckie is his best work. He's a great character, and Cryer really makes him come across as real and loveable, even when the character does and says some not so loveable things. Cryer is wonderful, and his dance in the record shop is classic. A great cast.    But how is the rest of the movie?. Just as fun and enjoyable as it's wonderful cast!. The premise of the film may not be anything new, but hey, anything is good 10 times over if it is done well, with the right characters, the right writing, and the right actors to pull it off. PIP was lucky with John Hughes penning the script, so it's going to be better than an average 80's teen flick, and the characters were real and relatable. The movie really captures that feel and essence of certain hierarchy at high schools, the lesser individuals below them, and how they intertwine with each other and get along...or, not get along, as the case may be. The film and it's script ring very truthful in that area, and even though there may be some characters you expect to see in a movie such as this, the characters don't seem like cardboard rip-offs, but their own individual selves. The movie may have some romance and drama, but it also has a nice balance of humor, mostly from Duckie or at his expense, that feels natural. In fact,most of the movie feels natural, even though there will be some who will still question rich guy Blane's interest in Andi. As for how it all turns out, well, it could of gone either way. John Hughes wanted one thing, the director and producers wanted and expected the audience to want another thing. I liked the way the movie ended(even if Hughes didn't), but I will not spoil it for you if you have not seen it yet.     The \\"Everything Duckie\\" edition has, well, everything you could want. Where to start?. There is a great selection of bonus material here, and you get over 90 minutes worth!. For starters, there is \\"The First Time: The Making Of Pretty In Pink\\", which is a nicely done documentary that is pretty self explanatory. A featurette on Ringwald called \\"Prom Queen: All About Molly\\". \\"Volcanic Ensembles\\" is a piece on, you guessed it, the wild fashion that is on showcase in the film. So very 80's, and that's why it's so cool. People tell their own stories of that special night in every senior's life with \\"Prom Stories\\". More goodies to come!. \\"Favorite Scenes\\" has cast and crew commenting on, well, their favorite scenes. You also get the original ending titled \\"The Last Dance\\". If that's not enough, there is also a featurette titled \\"Zoids And Riches\\", \\"Wrap up: The Epilogue\\", a photo gallery, and a commentary with director Howard Deutch. Surprisingly, since everything else is on here, there is no trailer for the film.    \\"Pretty In Pink\\" comes from that special, magical time known as the 80's. Before Miley, Jonas, and Britney, there was Ringwald, McCarthy, and Duckie. \\"Pretty In Pink\\" is a classic piece of 1980's John Hughes/teen comedy goodness. It holds a place alongside some of the more revered films of his and the times, but deserves a place nonetheless. It was nicely written, well acted, and deliverd an enjoyable viewing experience. All that and a truck load of special features?. How can it fail?!. It can't. Pick it up.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Overall,    A great deal.  While HD-DVD is dead, the originals in standard DVD are outstanding.  Maybe blu-ray will be better but by how much?  If you want these at this price go for it.

B001NLL8LA|2.0|It's still thin. The best Reacher novels let us inside Jack none Reacher's mind and observe his conflict. About getting older, about possibly settling down, about who to help and under what circumstances, about conflicts of interest, and conflicts of the heart.    In Gone Tomorrow and Nothing to Lose, Jack Reacher never reflects on his age, health, choices, regrets, feelings, etc. Reacher is like the terminator, a relentless problem-solver. But he's not a human. Which makes it boring.    Gone Tomorrow is better than the lame Nothing to Lose. Just not enough better.
B0000YB7Z8|4.0|I was aware of Jethro Tull, but limited to knowing only a few tunes (Aqualung, Conundrum, Thick As A Brick). I had a cassette copy of Conundrum a friend made me many, many years ago (8th grade?), and recently learned that Bursting Out is the only recording it's on. I really wanted to own that song on disc, and thought it a good opportunity to finally check out some more Tull. Glad I did! This album is great. It's hard to describe Jethro Tull other than using the label 'progressive rock', so I'll leave it at that. It's really a shame there isn't more music like this being made today. Classic, timeless, great music from the 70's. Well recorded, too. Pick it up.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Apparently this is the \\"cleaned up\\" version of Let it Be.  But I personally think it simply isn't worth it.  Why?  Because most, if not all, of these songs were released before.  The versions of \\"Get Back,\\" \\"Let it Be,\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" that are presented here are the same versions used previously on various Greatest Hits compilations.  \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" without strings was nice to hear, but it too was released on the Beatles Anthology Volume 3 in the mid '90s.  The other tracks are great, but essentially the same as was heard on the 1970 \\"Let it Be\\" album.    One can debate about whether or not it is nice to have the previously released tracks in one convenient place.  As a longtime fan myself, however, I already had the other albums containing the same tracks long before this was released.  So it really does little good for me.

B001TOD9VI|4.0|Many people on here have given a detailed synopsis of the movie and what it is about. I just wanted to say that Darren A. has completed another remarkable film to enjoy and he is an amazing director.<br /><br />everyone in the film (not just Rourke & Tomei) put in fantastic performances and it made me want to cry by the very end. The key to this movie is that this guy really tries and has a good heart but the world is very unforgiving. I know that the analogy of being a drummer and a wrestler don't exactly mesh but it reminds me of the thankless position that myself as a drummer and a professional wrestler live parallel lives with. You spend your life conforming your body to a certain look and stamina only to try and please people for hour-bursts of time every so often. And your band, just like w/ the people he werestled with, are your home away from home where people look up to and respect you outside of the common world. The film did a great job in showing how people with the best intentions and 'follow your heart' gusto sometimes don't always rise to the top as they should.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I was a big fan of Twin Peaks back in the early 1990's and have for years wanted to purchase the series, but was always stopped by the cost.  During one of my visits to Amazon.com I came across the DVD collection for a price I was willing to pay, and am very happy to finally have this item!<br /><br />The show lasted two seasons, and, although I was a faithful viewer, can't believe how much I'd forgotten!  It's fun to see the actors with whom I was unfamiliar at the time, who have gone on to other TV shows and movies that I later watched and enjoyed.  I'm still going through the special features, and they've added some great insight for me.<br /><br />The Twin Peaks story is as quirky and odd as it was almost 20 years ago and definitely transcends time quite well.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this for any Twin Peaks fans - or folks who love obscure tales.  Now, back to my cherry pie...
B001FB55MG|4.0|In recent years I've become rather cold to anything dealing with Adam Sandler.  I find his newfound humor to be unfunny.  Maybe he hasn't really changed a whole lot; maybe my reaction to his films has something to do with my personal tastes changing as I get older, but pretty much everything he's touched since '50 First Dates' has proved itself meandering and irritating to me.<br /><br />Needless to say, I had no interest in seeing this film.<br /><br />My best friend and his wife had rented this for their kids, and they invited my wife and I to come over with our daughter and watch it.  Beings that I pride myself on being easy going I didn't insist on a different film, I just came over with the family and braced myself for a `bad' movie.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />`Bedtime Stories' has its fair share of faults and it suffers in ways from the usual `kiddy film' clich&eacute;s, but it manages to keep you interested and entertained throughout the films entirety, which is something I did not expect.  Also, with it being a children's film, Sandler's usual flair for the unnecessarily offensive is toned down so that he actually comes off as funny as apposed to moronic.  He truly is the most impressive thing about the film, mostly because I expected him to be a befuddled mess.  He kept himself in line and managed to bring a spark of sincerity to his character, giving the films overall moral a boost from his surprisingly charming performance.<br /><br />Aside from Sandler, the film is littered with serviceable performances, some of them excelling more than others.  Keri Russell is charming and beautiful as ever and is the perfect complement to Sandler here.  Guy Pearce is not an actor that I have been overly fond of, and this is not his best work, so that's all I have to say.  He plays a very clich&eacute;d `villain' but he doesn't really make it his own.  Russell Brand is hilarious and serves as genuinely memorable comedic relief here.  Teresa Palmer is extremely good looking, and that's all she needed to be, so she works.  Richard Griffiths is pretty much a throwaway here, but he does fine.<br /><br />Courtney Cox needs more work.<br /><br />So, in the end, this charming little film about a lonely man whose bedtime stories start to come true is fun for the whole family and well worth giving a try.is extremely good looking, and that's all she needed to be, so she works.

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|You wanted the animal, you got the animal.<br /><br />The story starts early in 1840's Canada Northwest Territories (history tells us this section of Canada was not \\"Northwest Territories\\" until 1870 but this is a review, not a history lesson) -- with Wolverine as a child living with his brother and father.  Seems Logan is a mutant and has bone claws when he gets emotionally distraught.  When his father is killed by a gunshot, Logan gets very angry and slices the guy who did it, who turns out, in his dying breath is Logan's actual father.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />No explanation on why this is and it has nothing to do with the rest of the story, other than a plot device to have Logan and his brother (Sabertooth) escape into the forest to fend for themselves.<br /><br />A very fast run through American wars -- Civil, WWI, WWI, Vietnam -- (what happened to Korea?  Oh well) -- find Logan's brother loving the bloodlust to a point where he enjoys killing and nearly rapes a Vietnamese woman until Logan steps in.

Hardly five minutes goes by when they're mercilessly gunned down by Striker's forces.  Why?

B000068CNX|4.0|This is fun to see the cast go through the tech revolution. In season one they have upgraded from the collapsible-antenna cordless phone to something a shade more modern. Their clothing is still really 90's and they haven't developed the chemistry yet, though. It is fun to see the episodes that lay the ground work for a lot of the story lines down the road. Worth buying if you're a Friends fan.

B000A32KJQ|5.0|Think of the great ECM albums: Belonging, The Koln Concert, Witchi-Tai-To, Yellow Fields, Crystal Silence, et al. Manu Katche's Neighbourhood belongs right up there with them. This may come as a surprise, especially after the years 1985-2000 were such a lackluster period for the label. During their peak period (1973-83), ECM would release 12-15 essential albums a year. This figure dropped off to 2-3 a year, if even that. Starting about 2004, the label has made an amazing comeback, and Neighbourhood is right at the forefront - it really is that good.    While other reviewers have complained this album is not over-the-top intense enough, it does have its moments where everyone contributes and the tempos (tempi?) do quicken. But no, it's not an in-your-face performance. With ECM, it's usually safe to think late-night/winter afternoon chamber jazz, and those labels effectively describe this music. Clocking in at a modest 55:07, the album does not overstay its welcome (sometimes a problem with ECM recordings).    Interestingly, trumpeter Tomasz Stanko is billed first, and he almost steals the whole album. He adds dissonances to songs such as \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Lovely Walk\\", a \\"Milestones\\"-ish riff to \\"Take off and land\\", and a mournful line to the haunted impressionism of \\"February Sun\\" (a perfect ECM title). But the duets with Jan Garbarek are what really stand out, particularly on \\"Good Influence\\". Garbarek and his distinctive sound only appear on 5 tracks, but they are all among the album's best. It's easy to take the excellent work of pianist Marcin Wasilewski for granted: this is the perfect medium for his work. Double-bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz has one of his best recorded performances ever, whether providing the melody line on the trio number \\"November 99\\", or driving the uptempo \\"Number One\\". As for the \\"leader\\", Manu Katche is content not to dominate the proceedings - the closest he comes to a solo is in the center section of \\"Lovely Walk\\". Make no mistake, this isnot a typical drummer-as-leader album. But listen to his cymbal work and rimshots throughout, even when it sounds like not much is happening - there is no one better.    After playing with everyone from Peter Gabriel to Robbie Robertson to Tears for Fears, some might be surprised to hear Katche make such a thought-provoking, yet straight-ahead recording. But I make no qualifications for calling this the jazz album of the year for 2005, slightly edging Enrico Rava's Tati (also highly recommended).

0066620996|5.0|In this book, Jim Collins shows the results of his studies of \\"enduring great companies. How they grow, how they attain superior performance, and how good companies can become great companies.\\" Collins devoted more than 10 years of research of several companies and compared them to see their development and success. Collin's brings many valuable points when he talks about management, and the roll they play in their company's success. He describes the level 5 leadership where an individual with extreme personal humility is the ones most likely to go on to be successful in the industry and as a leader. The beautiful thing about this level 5 leader is the humble personality that surrounds it and the willingness to work with the people and for the people, not for their personal ambitions and success. Good to Great, addresses the issue Why Some Companies Make the leap......And others don't, and how a good company can become a great company, and if so, how?  I recommend this book highly because of its unique perspective and scientifically valid research.
B001YYQ9SS|3.0|Square has been working for the past 2 years to redo this film as a \\"director's cut\\", adding new detail to scenes, completely revamping the composition of some shots, as well as adding new scenes, so you think one of the world's premiere CG production studios would produce a flawless hi-def transfer, right?  Not so fast.  Unlike studios such as Pixar, Square seems to believe adding imperfections to an otherwise flawless source somehow enhances the viewer experience.  The same thing was done in \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\\" where dirt and film grain was added to an entirely digital picture source.  I actually prefer the blu-ray release of that film to this one.  Add on top of that most of the DVD features for Advent Children have been changed or completely left out, forcing completists to own both versions of this movie to have all the bonus content, a film that is not worth that much trouble in my opinion.  Overall, Square really dropped the ball on this one, the picture is soft, fuzzy and washed out in most scenes where it could have been brilliantly vibrant and clear.  There are obviously artistic differences between Japanese and American animation houses, and I don't see those being rectified anytime soon.

I have to keep reminding myself that the twenty-first century filters are in place, and that the thoughts, attitudes, and even physical environment might seem real, but are really research-based presumptions.      On the other hand, she seems to have done her research, and it was a fascinating story.

B001L1S1SK|3.0|I hate to give less than a good rating for this show, partly because I enjoyed it so much in the first two seasons and partly because it is part of a format under siege from the networks, long story arc TV.  But sadly I think the show lost a lot of its force.  More about this further down.<br /><br />The major networks are nearly on the verge of killing off most long story arc TV series.  It is not difficult to understand why.  Overwhelmingly the best shows on TV are long story arc serials.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, MAD MEN, BREAKING BAD, DOLLHOUSE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, LOST, DEXTER, THE WIRE, IN TREATMENT, BIG LOVE, and TRUE BLOOD would be accounted among the most critically acclaimed shows on TV.  All are long story arc serials.  On the other hand, you have a host of procedurals that are popular with fans, but have no critical acclaim whatsoever and do poorly at the Emmys and Golden Globes, like the CSI shows, the LAW AND ORDER shows, THE MENTALIST, and similar shows.  CBS has a schedule almost completely filled with procedurals and episodic shows that feature no long story arcs.  CBS's shows are the least critically acclaimed on TV, but CBS is far and away the highest rated network in terms of viewers.  There is, therefore, a growing rift between those shows that TV critics and more discriminating TV viewers celebrate as the best that television has to offer, and those shows that a majority of people choose to watch.  The reason that the episodic procedurals do so well is the very low demands that they place on viewers.  If you jump into the middle of MAD MEN, you will be lost.  There will be a host of subtleties that make it impossible to follow.  These very nuances are the reason that fans take such enormous delight in the show.<br /><br />Which leads me to UGLY BETTY.  The show is definitely not episodic.  The conflict in one episode almost always carries over into the next.  Some of the arcs are very long.  Most are relatively short, going over 3 or 4 episodes.  I'm sure some of this is in way of a compromise with ABC.  My major concern with the show has been the increasing triviality of the arc.  The events on the show more and more have little or not import.  It is as if in attempting to satirize Latin American soap opera all they are concerned with is doing something reasonably outrageous, not something that takes us more deeply into the characters.  Perhaps not all will agree with me.  But I found in Season Three that I was coming to care less and less what happened to the major characters.  I came to feel a disconnect because things didn't seem to change to a believable degree.  I mean, take the way Betty dresses.  Yes, yes, I know.  She is supposed to be different.  But she works at a frakkin' fashion magazine!  I know the title of the show has \\"ugly\\" in it, but America Ferrara's wig and glued on eye brows and clip on braces is getting a little tiring.  I suppose that what I am complaining about is that the show hasn't really managed any substantial character development over three seasons, despite the story details that we are given each week.  I suppose I'm also a bit put off by the ease with which they dispense of important characters.  Some of these have been effective, but some just seemed casual.  The elimination of Rebecca Romijn was especially troubling (though she was not pregnant when she was written out of the show, her departure did eliminate the need to either explain how the transsexual Alexis or at least how to hide her pregnancy), which seemed to be primarily a cost cutting move.  Ashley Jensen also departed the show, though in her case it appeared to have more to be her choice.  She was reputedly not terribly happy about the move of the show to New York (the show was shot in L.A. the first two seasons).  And the show suffered from not having any kind of adequate replacement for the departure of Henry and Gio from the show.  I suppose the way I can express my overall disatisfaction with the show is that I no longer have any kind of sense that anyone in charge of the show has any kind of vision about where the show is going.  It isn't, in short, a show telling a story, despite its embrace of the long story arc; it is telling stories.  It has failed to transcend in any way the soap opera format.  I even found myself unmoved by Daniel's marriage to a woman who was dying.  I can handle a lot of melodrama, but that was too melodramatic even for my taste.<br /><br />The show did well, at least, in its move to NYC.  We got a lot of delightful external shots of the city.  The offices of Mode remained the same, probably all the result of a soundstage.  Visually the show really took off.<br /><br />The fourth season of UGLY BETTY could well be its last.  ABC has moved it out of its Thursday night slot -- replacing it with what looks to be the best upcoming new series by ABC, FLASHFORWARD -- and has moved it to Friday night.  Right now it appears that it will be shown in the 9 EST slot.  Given that one of my favorite shows, DOLLHOUSE, is in the same timeslot, UGLY BETTY will remain a DVR show for me (on Thursdays I've been watching SMALLVILLE for years -- it ironically has also been moved to Fridays, though in the 8 EST slot, giving me a SMALLVILLE/DOLLHOUSE Friday double bill).  This shift to Fridays could well be the beginning of the end for Betty and Mode.  Most shows that do well on Fridays are geared at seniors (THE GHOST WHISPERER, for instance, does well in an older demographic).  DOLLHOUSE had weak ratings, but because it was the #1 time-shifted show on TV (i.e., people did not watch it live, but either on DVR, via streaming off FOX.com, or by download from iTunes or Amazon Unbox--it was also very heavily watched via Torrents) it managed to live.  But they don't call Fridays the \\"Death Slot\\" for nothing.  My gut tells me that Season Four will be the show's last.  I hope that we see some growth and development before it ends.  Betty's teeth look pretty darned straight!  Lose the braces!  And I'd like to see them take some real risks with the characters, instead of the pseudo risks that they have in the past.  I haven't given up on the show quite yet.  But it isn't must-see TV for me any longer.  Hopefully that will change in the show's fourth season.ave any kind of sense that anyone in charge of the show has any kind of vision about where the show is going.  It isn't, in short, a show telling a story, despite its embrace of the long story arc; it is telling stories.  It has failed to transcend in any way the soap opera format.  I even found myself unmoved by Daniel's marriage to a woman who was dying.  I can handle a lot of melodrama, but that was too melodramatic even for my taste.    The show did well, at least, in its move to NYC.  We got a lot of delightful external shots of the city.  The offices of Mode remained the same, probably all the result of a soundstage.  Visually the show really took off.    The fourth season of UGLY BETTY could well be its last.

0810979772|5.0|My son hates to write, but he has read every one of these books, and he found out about the diary, so I got it for him, he is writing in it allot! He really enjoys this!
B001W63DX2|5.0|If you buy this and play it once it would be worth the money.    The performances are outstanding.  Bruce in fine voice, the playing excellent, the sound really not stadium affected, the band is VERY tight, the crowd shots and involvement just amazing.   A way to attend a Maiden concert without having to mingle.  I have most of their concert videos and this one is WAY better than the others.  I will play it over and over (my favorite Maiden stuff really well done and filmed.)    I thought the documentary stuff was pretty much standard rockumentary stuff.   (the part where members say only nice things about members of the family, the part about how hard the crew works, the drummer who is a good hearted goof,etc...) Suspect Maiden is another one of those bands where the members have grown into adults and don't want their family to be part of the circus that comes with fame.  It was worth watching once but I can't imagine wanting to see it again.
0441017177|5.0|A terrific read.  Reynolds' best work in my opinion.  My complaints (limited as they are) about Reynlods have generally centered on his sometimes weak endings and occasionally flat characters. This book has none of those \\"flaws\\" (and I hesitate to use that term as Reynolds is a fabulous writer all around).  If you like hard SF, you will like this book.  Guaranteed.
1400082773|1.0|This book is a joke. It is silly, self serving and I actually read it and wasted a good 4 hours out of my life that I will NEVER be able to replace. It was horrible.
B0026LYM5U|4.0|I must disagree with the other negative review here, as I found this to be an exceptional album, in many ways, even surpassing \\"Home\\". I'd expected the worse with an \\"Anneke replacement\\", as her voice is simply one of the best, and brought this band from obscurity to world fame. But I must say, the new singer definitely holds her own here, sounding a bit like her predecessor on a few tracks, while adding her own flavor to other songs. I also find some of the music here to remind me of some moments from my favorite Gathering album, \\"How to measure a planet\\", while offering a few slightly heavier, guitar-oriented pieces that harken back to the \\"Nighttime Birds\\" days. My only complaint, really, is the lead track, a one-note guitar riff song with no vocals, that simply doesn't belong here at all. Thankfully, everything that follows is a big step up. If you like this band at all, you should find this Anneke-less version just as compelling.
B00005JPD0|4.0|If you love movies that keep you guessing you will like Deja Vu.  An interesting, suspenseful storyline mixed with a sci-fi twist.  Denzel Washington is good as always, but James Caviezel really shines as the villain in this story.
B001FXCE46|3.0|A lot has been said about this album.  Many hardcore fans of the band have cried blasphemy since its release and have accused the band of selling out, yet the whole world rejoiced and sang along to \\"Sex on Fire,\\" (as did the RIAA who awarded them a Grammy for it).  So how good is this album really? Why the ruckus among fans and newcomers alike?<br /><br />I saw them in 2004 in a hole-in-the-wall club called the Beaumont Club in Kansas City when they were just starting out.  I was  15 at the time and I had fallen in love with their early sounds of Molly's Chambers, Spiral Staircase, and other great songs.  I loved their mix of the Strokes, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rollings Stones, Bob Dylan and other roots and classic rock influences.<br /><br />Ever since then, I was hooked and as a musician I was ecstatic to notice their change in sound on their Because of the Times album. I understood even more how talented these guys really are in a world where it is hard to be original.  When I heard they were releasing this album so soon after \\"Because,\\" I eagerly anticipated the hyped album.<br /><br />The result?  As a fan, I'm not gonna lie, the early sounds of their first 3 albums get me every time and I love the country/rock twang of their first 3 albums.  However, I'd be a hypocrite if I did not find anything to like on this album.  Songs like Cold Desert, Crawl, Sex on Fire, and Manhattan get the job done and rank up with Arizona and some of their greatest work so far.  However, the rest of the album is full of pointless and messy filler.  Incredibly boring and long winded, it seems like the band has fallen in love with U2 styled overdrive and other various sound effects they can't effectively use.  It's like their trying to sound like their touring brethren U2 and Pearl Jam, and the sound unfortunately does not suit them well.<br /><br />As for selling out? Well.... Caleb is going to be a judge on Iron Chef America and they're remixing this album so you can be the ones to decidethat one.  However, Caleb on Iron Chef America to me is like Pete Townshend going on Hollywood Squares, just sayin'.<br /><br />Conclusion: Less effects, better writing, less painkillers.  Not a bad effort after having 3 great albums. Back to the drawing board.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|This is a terrible movie.  The dodgeball film Ben Stiller did was much more palatable, which isn't saying much.  They've taken three of the most over exposed actors, two of which aren't even really actors, and given them a horrible vehicle.  The veritable avalanche of Jack Black and Ben Stiller projects is begining to taste like so many doses of castor oil.  It's begining to resemble the Will Ferrel syndrome; please make it stop.  The Tom Cruise \\"cussing jewish producer guy\\" was so over sold that when I watched his performance I was just left scratching my head.  The same can be said for the black face Robert Downey; it's funny that he's wearing an afro wig and lowered his voice a few octaves?  I don't get it.  I'd rather watch 'Kelley's Heros' for the 20th time.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|The only thing I'll say is this: if they plan on continuing this show for a 9th, 10th, or 11th season, they'll have no choice but to abandon their \\"no flights, no tights\\" policy. C'mon already! Clark should be flying by now!!!
B000MXPE74|4.0|I'm not much on buying CDs without knowing the artist first.  I had heard thier one song on Run Fat Boy Run, but other than that the band was unknown to me.  I must say I was impressed.  The songs are catchy and have more of an up-beat swing to them.  This is definately worth the money.
B000W91RUG|5.0|With an upscaling dvd/blu ray player its just the same as watch a movie in blu ray.<br /><br />CHEAPER ALSO.
0316044695|3.0|Firstly, I'm not rating this so low because of the author's political rantings.  He's entitled to them, it's his book.  The problem is that the book is billed as one thing - \\"an eyewitness acount of...\\", but spends a lot of time rehashing the right's anti-media message.  I just wish i knew up front that the book was part diatribe.  I'd guess that many true professional SF operators are embarassed by this account.  Not only by the author's self promotion, but also by the fact that it leaves readers wondering what all this training is going for if it does not to prepare the men for the possibility of running into civilians.  I don't think the author did a good job explaining why they were unprepared for this.    The main issue with this book was that the prose was written for the 14 year old male's sophistication level.  The story could be great if not for such childish writing.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|Good Movie, I do not no why Mickey Rourke was an outcast (or black listed) in Hollywood for so many years. I think we the public lost out on his acting skills1<br />Very, Very happy to see him back!!!!
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I just want to help push this album to the full 5 stars it deserves. It's amazing rock-n-roll. As other reviewers have said, get in your car tonight, roll down the windows, put in this CD, and reset yourself.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|One of my favorite movies, it came in the package I expected and is a great movie. I am very pleased.
B00005T7I1|5.0|I've been watching \\"Dick Tracy\\" for years, and as a result it's become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout childhood and I used to see it quite often. Seeing it now, as an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satiric and incredibly misunderstood. About the only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination Pacino received - other than that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of a fuss when it came out.<br /><br />Pacino is over-the-top but to good effect as he's clearly having loads of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film, possibly, I have ever seen. Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking. The lighting, velvet overtones and smog/smoke combine to create a great effect.<br /><br />There are some really funny cameos including one by Dustin Hoffman as \\"Mumbles,\\" and I don't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting - even the mandatory kid-character is far better than expected.<br /><br />Overall, a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated. The critics' reviews are very positive (check out RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the film once again it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book, from style to eccentricity.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|To say that this concert is great would be a huge understatement. Before buying, I read through many reviews at amazon after one or two reviewers commented on the audience's participation (singing along with Stevie too much). Needless to say, I'm glad I did as so many other reviews suggested and purchased this dvd. Stevie is amazing and his accompanying band and singers were great too. I loved every minute of this show (watched it at least 3 or 4 times since I bought it)from start to finish. I cannot say much without repeating what many have already stated, but if you're a fan of Stevie Wonder or have even so much as a remote interest in his music, I would definitely recommend this concert.    The picture and sound quality is very nice and like the audience members at the show, I couldn't help but find myself singing along and enjoying the music. It's a really good show to have a great time in the comfort of your home with the surround sound turned up. As always, amazon was right on schedule with the delivery and the goods arrived in top shape.  Long story short: I was highly entertained and amazed by this concert. It was worth every penny!
1400063515|2.0|I ordered this book for a relative on May 13th.  As of Saturday June 6th, they still had not received it.
B000FUF6QS|3.0|The Wicker Man is rich in symbolism and effective in its delivery..<br />It is clear what the main character is struggling with - he is a christian who cannot get used to the idea that at heart he is guided by natural forces.. this struggle is very beautifully represented in the scene where the girl next door is making a not so subtle declaration of erotic intention and the police officer is very obviously pained by his own desires..<br />Later on in the film the phallic symbol is thrown in our face even more deliberately and obviously the man once again recoils in horror at the way nature is embraced by this culture. Other male symbols are also present - the sun is one of the oldest of masculine archetypes.. as are any circular forms and rituals..<br />The ending of the film is probably what shocked audiences the most at the time of release.. and release is a fitting for the feeling this scene gives to me.. the man has sacrificed all his desires and this is the very core symbol of his self sacrifice.. of course, realized in an external way in order to show the internal.. its all very dream like and precise..<br />Now for my criticism... I find this film to be very good but at times I feel a complete lack of emotion even though the film is dealing with a very emotional struggle.. I felt no sympathy for the main character.. and even in feeling detatched I did not feel that I had any clearer vision than I would have if I were more connected.. I think if I could identify with the feelings of shock and horror - if I could feel the man's christian sensibility as if it were my own (which it is not) I would be more horrified at the end... so I guess i would recommend this to christian viewers who may have also been shocked by the exorcist.<br />What I did enjoy about the film was the almost Jung like layers of archetypical ritual.. I think it is a very good movie - but I cannot be among the many who consider it a masterpiece.
0060557818|5.0|Neil Gaiman always comes through. He never disappoints. Even though the story takes place underground, this was not a dark tale, never gloomy, simply fantastic.
0452286751|5.0|I read this book a year ago - as the US Primary season was in full force.  I enjoy the Rand philosophy of objectivism - it fits me.  After reading the book it was so easy to classify candidates in the Roark or Toohey.    In the book Toohey was clearly the villain - he sought to control the thoughts of others and used a humanitarian theme to justify his actions.  His actions and comments seem similar to the guy we elected president.  However we do not judge our new president as a `villain' in this sense - Even though he and Toohey used the same methods to gain thoughts and minds of their followers.    I now find myself classifying people as either Roarks or Tooheys.  And if it sounds like a duck - normally it is.  This is a great piece of literary excellence.  I loved all of it and highly recommend it to everyone.
B00005QFE5|5.0|For fans of faster-paced movies, be forewarned: this is extremely slow. For others who love a beautifully-filmed movie or a touching romance story whatever the pace, this Chinese film will do nicely.    Zhang Ziyi, who has now become an International star, never looked prettier and more appealing than here. Maybe that's because she plays such a sweet, innocent, non-violent (no martial arts here) character: a woman smitten with a new teacher in town and one who will go any lengths (in a totally pure sense) to be noticed and attract this man, mainly in the form of exercising incredible patience.    The long, middle segment of the film is in brilliant, almost stunning-looking color. The beginning and end of the film are both in black-and-white. The cinematography for both parts is magnificent.  The film would really look good with a sharp Blu-Ray transfer.
B0009MWAVQ|4.0|Nothing much to add to what the other reviews have already said.Scott Ross was the first harpsichordist to record all of Scarlatti's sonatas and his performances remain unsurpassed.I have gave 4 stars because sometimes the engineers have miked the harpsichord rather too closely but<br />Scott's playing is of 5 star quality.Pieter Jan Belder's complete set on Brilliant Classics is also a 5 star performance although he is sometimes recorded with too much reverb.<br /><br />Overall you really can't go wrong with either version and both will give hours of listening pleasure.

B001TH15UM|5.0|I started to hear Prog Rock since I was 13, today I'm 42, and, became, between other bands, a YES,ELP, King Crimson, between other bands, fan.  Well, quite frankly, I was with not big expectations about this Show from, ASIA, you know, Howe with some health problems, Downes kind of out of shape, Wetton fat, Palmer with that \\"short weird hair and looking\\".... what a mistake !!! Those guys are booming and rocking better than on the begining of their respectives careers, very powerful, technical, keeping control of every little part of every song...Howe vibrating much more than at with YES, Palmer,kindly destroying and dominating the drums, Wetton singing perfectly from the botton to the top notes and Downes, with much more consistency and punch.  Definetely , a Blue Ray concert that worth every minute and money that I spent. Prog Roch Forever and hopefully more shows and long life to ASIA !
B000FVQLRA|5.0|In a day and time when so many are saying the Holicost never happened it's important to remind us that this really happened.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I just watched this for the millionth time, and I loved it all over again. The cinematography is fantastic and artfully done. The classical music score is so soothing and perfectly suits the story. The whole movie gives you a sense of life with the Bennets that is so real. They are a family whose quirks and charms are immediately evident, and you fall in love with them all. I like that the Bennetts house is so well lived-in and even a little dirty looking. There is a lovely contrast between their poorer household to the richer settings of Mr. Bingley's temporary residence and especially Mr. Darcy's home at Pemberly.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is such a wonderful Elizabeth Bennett. She is natural and witty and somewhat angelic, but she's still a little rough around the egdes and down to earth. I like how she seems silly at times but still knows how to conduct herself properly without coming off as a snob. She's confident but still maintains an innocent quality.<br /><br />Matthew Macfadyen is the hottest Darcy to walk the planet, in my opinion. At first, I wasn't sure about him, because he looked so much like a sourpuss when he made his entrance to the film, but, as his character transforms, he becomes more handsome and eventually just completely sexy - this is where I can see why Jane Austen first titled the book First Impressions. If that title had stuck, it would certainly still work for this story. All the little nuances of Darcy's - the stolen glances, the tension in his hands, etc. - were all captured perfectly on camera and really brought his secret longing for Elizabeth into focus for the audience.<br /><br />I have to add that there were moments when I wanted to jump through the screen and bite Darcy's bottom lip. For example, the rainy day scene was so intense...if I were Elizabeth, I'd be tempted to just say screw pride, I'm yours! And she almost looks like she will. But seriously...Matthew Macfadyen is exactly how I would want my own Darcy to be. The scene where he walks through the dew-covered field at dawn in his flowing coat and his boots and high-waisted pants, YUM! I'm so glad they kept that shot in real time so the audience can watch every single sway of his hips. Wow. Oh, and this is my favorite line of his, \\"You have bewitched me, body and soul.\\" Who talks like that anymore?! I love it!<br /><br />I like the BBC version...Colin Firth is such an awesome, sexy Darcy, too, and now we have this modern, more sexually tense P&P. Wow, two great P&P versions, Austen fans should rejoice about that!ew-covered field at dawn in his flowing coat and his boots and high-waisted pants, YUM!

0440238153|5.0|I took a long time to get around to reading the last of the Dark Materials books. I had heard the later books bog down in theology and long discussions, veering off from the more straight forward adventure presented in the first book. Nothing could be further from the truth. This trilogy found its legs in the second book and dug far deeper, literally into the depths of the earth for its spectacular finale, securing its place in the rarified pantheon of classic fantasy that will live forever. Pullman is right up there with C S Lewis. In fact, C S Lewis in particular is a fair comparison to this writer. Even if they could not be further apart with regards to their religious views, both authors used the genre of fantasy and science fiction to espouse their religious philosophies.<br /><br />Like any great work of fantasy, the book can be read as a parable, a metaphor for our lives in the real world.  However, because it is a serious work of visionary literature, it's main concern is not to function as a manifesto or philosophical argument. but to tell a wondrously entertaining story and involve us with marvelously sympathetic characters , which Amber Spyglass effortlessly does. This is the magic ingredient that, while not necessarily ensuring its place alongside Tolkien, Lewis and Peake, at least places it in the general vicinity.<br /><br />I am aware that there is a lot of controversy surrounding these books and rightfully so. I am not going to be an apologist for Pullman's position towards organized religion and in particular christianity as it evolved into the Catholic Church. Make no mistake: This is subversive literature. That being said, those who come to the simplistic conclusion that Pullman is an angry atheist could not be further from the truth. Indeed,  if one must resort to labels, it would seem that he is a sort of pantheistic, mystic gnostic,. His cosmology is immense and personal, reminding me of William Blake in its complexity and uniqueness. It is a world that allows for angels and witches to coexist and moreover, be either good or bad guys.<br /><br />These books work on many levels. On a basic level, it is a coming of age story that any young teen can relate to. On a deeper level, it is a probing visionary manifesto that skewers the disempowering aspect of organized religion. The book encourages the reader to courageously think for oneself, question authority and to discover the answers to life's great questions through observation and direct experience. It is a pro-science, anti- dogma philosophy that will madden some church elders and encourage more forward thinking christians to think outside the box.<br /><br />When it comes right down to it, the books teach us that life is sacred, and that love has the ultimate power to heal, transform and regenerate. And in the end, what could be more christian than that!?orld that allows for angels and witches to coexist and moreover, be either good or bad guys.<br /><br />These books work on many levels.

0142410373|5.0|I was walking through the halls of the public library in Cleveland and I found a shelf with all these Roald Dahl books! And then I spotted \\"Matilda.\\" I've been looking for \\"Matilda\\" because my mom had read it and she loved it! My mom is a good judge of books so I wanted to read it.     So I checked out the book and ran to the car so I could go to my grandma's house and read it. I had a bursting feeling in side of me. I felt ready to explode! When the car pulled into the driveway and parked, I burst out of the car and ran inside my grandma's house, flopped down on my favorite chair and started reading \\"Matilda.\\"     The character Matilda is a genius girl with idiot parents who are always yelling and raging at her for no reason! With Matilda's magic powers she pays back her parents and has a fun time driving them crazy.     But things at school are different. The hated headmistress the Trunchbull is no match for Matilda and her magic powers. Miss Honey has a loving heart and trusts Matilda with her biggest secret.     This book is extremely funny and mysterious. After I finished this genius book, and my mom knew I loved it, she got me the movie! The movie is good, but not nearly as good as the book. You should see the movie and read the book! They're both wonderful.  -by Eliza (a student in msdu's class)
B001NESPHC|3.0|I had never heard of this artist before purchasing this CD. I really enjoyed listening to it.  It is reminiscent of early jazz in NYC.

B001EYGOEM|2.0|Dear Taylor Swift,<br /><br />Recently I had the pleasure of obtaining your new album and I listened to it a couple of times. Here are some of the observations:<br /><br />1) YUCK.<br /><br />2) Country Music is an actual genre. Read up on it. What you make is not country music<br /><br />3) There is such a thing as a good song. Reba McEntire used to write some. Go back and do some research<br /><br />4) Songs containing references to sunshine, bunnies, happiness and rainbows all belong in kindergarten<br /><br />5) YUCK.<br /><br />6) Please stop making 'music', or whatever it is you call it.

Missing the final 15 minutes of the film, Triad is using as the basis of its release, stolen material from the Synapse Special Edition.  Via Amazon, this same release is available as a download.  Same garbage, same stolen video.    Caveat Emptor
B000QQFKYE|5.0|The human condition calls for us to make order out of chaos. This is the role of the magician, the role of the myth maker, the role of David Lynch. And with Inland Empire he does not disappoint. Laura Dern leads us on a road to madness in this film. What is our first signpost but a typical crazy Lynchian neighbor who tears open time, transplanting Dern into tomorrow with a warning from today. Who are the rabbits that appear in the TV sitcom? Who are the women that appear to be as much Dracula's Brides as common street whores? It does not matter. As with all of Lynch's films it is best to sit back and allow all of this to wash over you. Once exposed to the relentless waves of madness you will be prepared for the myth maker that is Lynch to slowly give you pieces to the puzzle. A horrific end turns out to be only part of the film within the film. Or is it? Dern's madness may not be her own. A Polish woman may be dreaming it all. Or is she? With the torments of the universe swirling about pitiful humankind one can really only be along for the ride. Looking for real clues is useless, for as one character at the end of the film tries to explain over and over to another how to get to Pamona, the other, wiser character insists basically that you cannot get there from here. You cannot get to sanity from insanity. The myth maker knows that there are no \\"solutions\\" only \\"being\\" and acceptance. Inland Empire is yet another master piece from David Lynch.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've watched all year, a story so far removed from the norm, you won't want to take your eyes off the screen for a second.  Watching, you'll wonder whether or not the romance between Benji and Daisy will lead to them spending their lives together, but the story is so much more than a romance.  It's a tale of family, love, and life, of taking what life has to offer and living to the fullest.    Don't miss this movie!
B001EOQTM4|2.0|Dehumanizer is easily a four star record but this is a review of the newly released vinyl version.  This is a prime example of how NOT to release a vinyl version of an album.  This is absolutely terrible.  No gatefold.  No liner notes.  No nothing.  It's not even re-mastered!  I got it on vinyl hoping that it would sound warmer but it still has the same stale, surgical sounding production as the original '92 version.  I can't vouch for the re-mastered version of the CD but this is a very disappointing product coming from a label that prides themselves on giving vinyl the proper respect and treatment it's due.  Rhino should hang their collective heads in shame, seriously.  Conversely the recently released `H&H - The Devil You Know' vinyl version is incredible.  Everything a collector yearns for and more.  180g vinyl.  Gatefold.  Poster!  AND laser etching on side four!  The only thing it was missing was a personally greeting from all the band members, lol.  This is highly recommended.
6305907145|4.0|CodeMaster Talon's spotlight review is perfect - describing the likability of the movie, differences between the adaptation and Austen's original work, and some of his problems with the characters.  Yes, I too was frustrated by Jonny Lee Miller's Edmund - he should have been adamantly beating the drums about his feelings towards Fanny.  Instead, he comes across as meek and unable to speak his mind.  Sure, this is #2 son in the face of a gale force of a father (awesome portrayal by a brilliant Harold Pinter), but as Edmund increasingly fails to state the obvious (that he loves Fanny \\"as a man loves a woman\\" - as he finally lets out), you wonder: why again is she attracted to this man?  Like most of Austen's work, you spend the entire movie wanting to conk together the heads of the two protagonists who are clearly destined to be together.<br /><br />Jonny Lee Miller ([[ASIN:B001ASIHZG Eli Stone: The Complete First Season]]) reminds me of Tom Brady.  I half expected Giselle to bound into the screen.  Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davitz are excellent as the Crawford siblings.  Nivola and Davidtz played man and wife in the underrated drama [[ASIN:B000BYRCQU Junebug]].  Best known as Amy Adams' ride to recognition, Junebug's Davidtz and Nivola are every bit her equals in that film.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|Okay, everyone knows this movie. One of the greatest of all time and it set the standard for this type of movie until The Matrix came out. Still one the very best and I watch it often.<br /><br />Now, to this particular disk: Skynet BluRay Version. I bought our bluray player (Sony BDP-BX1) just 3 months ago, so I didn't think we'd have any problems.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1. You MUST have internet access hooked up to your bluray player. I had to go out and buy a 50' lan cable just so I could reach from the home office to the TV room. And it has to be plugged in to watch the movie. Unless your TV or HT room has internet access, you'll need a LAN cable laying on the floor during your movie watching. (and it cost me $22 for the cable. More than the movie.)<br /><br />2. You should have an extra memory stick plugged in to access some of the features. It told me I needed at least 10.5meg. I didn't plug it in, just skipped that part.<br /><br />3. It takes FOREVER to load. I'm talking a good 15-20 minutes from the time you put the disk in untill you see the first scene of the movie. I am not exaggerating.<br /><br />Also, I had to UPGRADE my brand new Sony BD player. It would not run at all until I ran the update. That itself took about 25 minutes. But of course it's a one time deal.<br /><br />Also, there is very little help or information on how to access the various parts of the disk. I still have not done anything but watch the movie one time. It was so frustrating, I just wanted to get away from it.<br /><br />The movie is great, but really I would not have bought it knowing all that I do now. If you just want to watch the movie and don't want to wait 20 minutes to start watching and you don't need all the other junk that goes with it, (which you have to have internet access and a LAN enabled player, plus a memory stick plugged in) skip this version.<br /><br />PS, I'm rating this disk 1 star. The movie is of course 5 stars, but the ordeal rates only 1 star.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|I wasn't prepared for how lousy this film was, despite the fact that it looked pretty and the stars did a reasonably good job. Dull, plodding, slow, awful screenplay full of cheap platitudes trying to pass as wisdom, ugh. Close to three hours I'll never get back in my life. Made me wish I could have gone backwards and skipped this. I really expected better from David Fincher and from the critics who placed this on their lists of best of the year.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|this show is great! i can't wait for hte 4th season to be out. awesome stuff!
0439813786|5.0|I bought this book after reading the suggestions of the previous book I finished.  I thought it seemed magical and that it would be a good read. I was so right. I fell in love with this book after the first page. I read it from cover to cover in a day. Now, I am not a person who finishes books of this length in a super short time but, I just couldn't put it down. This book tugs at your heartstrings, showers you with excitement , action, adventure and a lot of heart. This is a book for any visionary or child at heart. You will not be able to put it down and you will be captivated by the artwork. Let me say this; I will never give this book away, the art is to magnificant and adds so much to this book. One of the reviews I read for this book said something like this,that I think is so very ture \\"It combins elements of a   picture book, part graphic novel and part slient film\\" I hope that you choose to go on a reading experience of a lifetime. Please give this unique gem a chance.
0192802372|5.0|Received book in excellent condition and fast shipping.  I am enjoying this book, what a great read!  Thank you.
B00000264Y|5.0|I've been looking for this 2-CD Greatest Hits treasure for a while and Amazon.com not only had the product in stock but at a great price too!    Product arrived extremely fast as well as in \\"mint\\" condition and was a wonderful gift for my husband!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|It' small , light , will save your main battery and let you shoot fast. It will greatly improve the pictures you are taking now. Only the front panel adjusts. They never show pictures of that. And that's fine. About as easy to use as they come. No point in making any comparisons. Just go buy one.
0307266303|5.0|Very interesting book. Covers many different topics about running as the author runs us through the journey.  Trully motivational and informative!
B000A32KJQ|5.0|The music is unique. The listening enjoyable. Some cuts are a bit low-keyed, nonetheless, you'll enjoy this excellent CD.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|A beautiful mind brought back many memories of one of my family members who shared the same mental illness.  It really helped me to understand what he had gone through in his struggle with mental illness.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a person with mental illness in their family.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I have never before written a review for an item purchased at Amazon, but given the incredible amount of debate about this release, I feel compelled to weigh in. I've had a chance to sample all six films in this set, and I'm absolutely thrilled to be able to upgrade from the DVD versions. The first thing I noticed upon viewing the beginning of STTMP is that the heavy matte lines surrounding the Klingon ships have been removed, making the effect much more natural-looking. In addition, a lot of dirt and grime has obviously been removed, as it has on the other films. The transfers are all clean and sharp; yes, they are somewhat variable, but given the vintage of the films themselves, I think their original look is represented pretty well. DNR doesn't seem excessive to me; some grain was present in all the films, and the transfers all looked very pleasing on my 60-inch Sony. In addition to the generally good job Paramount has done mastering the films for Blu-Ray, I for one think they've also created an excellent package design. The individual thin cases are much preferable to the unwieldy packaging sometimes given multi-disc sets, and the art is tasteful and understated; the box is sturdy, and I like the translucent slipcover. Although I'm sure Paramount will eventually release the director's cuts of TMP, Khan and The Undiscovered Country, I think they deserve a bit of a break from the vehement criticism they've received regarding the presentation of these films. If you're not in love with the director's cuts, this nicely designed set is well worth the upgrade.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins' Good to Great gives a comprehensive breakdown of the key facets driving commercial success.  This book did not go over recent companies for good reason, as it sought to avoid falling in the technology trap along with giving companies too much credit for results that have not been sustained.  This book is a great read that does not bore the reader with an enormous amount of business vocabulary that only CEO's could understand.  This book was meant for any person or company looking to understand from where some previously unknown companies received a seemingly sudden push in the right direction.  Ultimately, it is up to the reader to develop their own understanding of the concepts presented within, however, the ease of reading the text gives some great ideas of where and on what to start.
0446579939|5.0|My husband is a Marine so this story really touched me! I would definately reccomend it!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I enjoyed the story and thought it had a lot of depth.  It was also well written.  My only criticism is that it was a bit confusing to keep track of the characters and their relationships, all throughout the story.  And, I cannot figure out the point of the character of Nell's daughter/Cassandra's mother.  So insignificant, I can't even remember her name!  I don't really understand her role in the story, unless it was just to show that while Nell thought she was done with her obligations (dauhter raised), she ended up being tied down with her grandchild.  Overall an interesting story with lots of layers - but unnecessariily confusing, and maybe a bit too long.
1433502410|5.0|Sometimes taking their cues from popular reformed authors, instead of classical reformed doctrine yields quite a few questionalble interpretations. (For instance, check the parables notes). Even though I agree with 90%+ of the doctrine, they impose it upon the text too heavily and in the wrong places.<br /><br />Still, a Study Bible really shouldn't be judged, in my opinion, on the correctness of the doctrinal focus, but rather on the ability to explain the literature, the grammatical functions of the text, the historic and sociological backgrounds, etc. Here ESV study Bible shines.<br /><br />You will love the maps, pictures, and drawings. It is a solid study Bible, well worth the price. Perhaps one could have wanted Nelson's Study Bible word studies too, but the volume is massive and very helpful. 5 stars.<br /><br />It is shiney! :)<br /><br />JJ
039472903X|5.0|As an \\"ad man\\", I found this book to be incredibly helpful on how to create advertising that produces long term results. If you are in advertising, read it and then read it again.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The show is diferent enough from the books to make it interesting and new for book fans. It sticks close enough to the story line to be authentic. I will be buying each season. :)
B000M4RGA6|4.0|Surprisingly good, funny movie from Will Farrell. His comedies are not usually my style, but here he plays things low-key and it works well. Plus the story is just weird, very much like a Michael Gondry film (Eternal Sunshine, Science of Sleep). Also stars Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is just so sexy in everything she does.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|On April 25th, I treated myself to a double feature at my theater. I saw this and Crank: High Voltage. I'm really glad I saw this movie. I'm a 19 year old guy, and I enjoyed it! I love when she sings Let's Get Crazy and the Hoedown Throwdown. After upsetting Lilly at her 16th Birthday party, Robby takes Miley back to Tennessee to find her true self. She meets a childhood friend from 1st grade, Travis who still has a crush on her. After having fun in Tennessee with her friends and family, Miley thinks of letting her alter ego, Hannah Montana go for good. I loved when Miley had to be two places at once. What will she choose? I highly recommend that you get crazy, get up and dance, and see HANNAH MONTANA: THE MOVIE!!!<br /><br />p.s. It's been awesome writing 600 reviews, and can't wait for 600 more!
B00111L0MY|5.0|Think of this as the sequel to 'Mystic River' and 'The Departed'. Not quite as classic as those 5-star movies, but still incredible in its own right. Really strong cast (except Morgan Freeman, who surprisingly seemed to phone it in a bit). Casey Affleck does a really good job as the lead; Michelle Monaghan is give little to do but does it well. Most notably, Amy Ryan is amazing as the mother of the disappeared girl - several reviews say it's Oscar-worthy, and I completely agree. This was my #2 movie of the year, behind only 'Before the Devil Knows Your Dead'. And as I've re-watched both since, I might even swap them and make this #1! Ben Affleck should stick to directing instead of acting!
B000007MVD|5.0|Okay, so there aren't any acoustic tracks because at that time because sound systems and all of that stuff was still pretty new, and it still is.  However, for tracks that are acoustic in their originally released studio versions, there's a bit more of a jazz feel.  I personally feel that with this album, George Harrison is definitely the star a lot of the time.  This album was where his guitar playing was very much his own.  This was before Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimi Hendrix created the modern rock guitar style, so what George's playing was for these recordings, unlike on the later stuff, was a mix of jazz and 1950s proto-rock.<br /><br />I think that his solo on \\"Till There Was You\\" is one of the most beautiful solos ever done.  It might be clearly structured, but sometimes that isn't a bad thing.  The double rhythm guitar that George and John do is some of the best.  It's also musically much more complex than it sounds, and they make it sound so easy.<br /><br />On some of the more recent tunes on this album, their Rolling Stones influence starts to show, especially on \\"I Feel Fine,\\" where the opening guitar riff has a slight similarity to the beginning of the verse melody of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\\" along with some of the other more blues-inspired music.  The Beatles were very influenced by several artists before them and the bands of the time and their influences definitely come out on this album more than any other album.<br /><br />Don't think that that's a bad thing, even the Beatles have influences; a lot of influences, which is one of the best things that anyone in music can have, that might even be more important than talent.
B000QUEQBS|1.0|Mark Wahlberg feature that is just awful. Made it about half-hour into it before turning it off. Just too stupid for me.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I liked this set of movies so much I bought it for a friend for his birthday. He is looking forward to watching  the movies.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|Decent summer action flick; not quite as good as part one (a classic), better than part three, about the same as part two (which I enjoyed). Preposterous plot that means nothing, some really cool actions scenes, and some amusing dialogue.
0393327345|5.0|I read this novel after just recently after seeign the movie back when it premiered those years ago. Fight Club was and still is one of those stories you'll never forget. The one thing I love about the book is the contrast it has to the movie. With the movie, David Fincher took certian liberites with how the story played out. Chuck's original was definitely the more intriguing of the two. :)
B000WAGVHE|5.0|This was truly a great movie, one of my only full Four Star ratings so far! Exuberant and totally non-cynical, it was a blast to watch! Never saw the original movie, but I did see the play. This is even better, with a great leading lady in Nikki Blonsky - her first movie role, she just steals every scene she's in. Reminds me of Jennifer Hudson in 'Dreamgirls', but this is an even better movie. Even John Travolta in drag works well.
0307388921|4.0|This was definitely another great story bu Chuck, but honestly it reminded a lot of the same themes that were discussed in fight club. But that being said, this has a brilliant way of describing the way the most paculiar relationships have of finding each other. Good read. :)
B0013FBS20|3.0|Good movie that is part 'Castaway', part '28 Days Later'. Will Smith does a very good job, but at some point I feel like I'd seen it all before.
0634022296|5.0|Im really glad with this buy. It has the perfect chords, i.e., different positions for the same chord in the same song, but it sounds different, just as the original song. Anyway, if that's difficult for you, you just can play the chords on their base position.    I havent yet found any errors on the book. It even includes some very strange songs I never heard of. Not even in singles.   This book is a must buy for beatles fans... I formerly was downloading tabs and chord files from the internet, but they are all so-so versions. This one has the right versions, no doubts, it is just perfect. Save yourself time and get this book.
B000U7169W|1.0|Hilary Swank is wasted in this silly movie that might have made an interesting X-Files episode, but even that would be a stretch. Even the effects are cheesy, as are the dialogue and plot. 1-star, mostly because Hilary looks good and tries hard to be better than the material.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|It to my complete bewilderment that this film has gotten the praise that it is. I have enjoyed every Pixar film I have seen, until this monstrosity. If I tend to use the word \\"torture\\" frequently in my descriptions, it doesn't even come close to conveying how much I suffered trying to make it through the movie. Honestly, I should have walked out, but I kept expecting the pace and plot to pick up..it never did. This film is about as tedious as it gets.    Imagine hearing two robotic, mentally-challenged voices repeating \\"WALL-E\\" and \\"E-VA\\", NON-STOP, over and over again...for what seems like 4 hours. I've just summed up \\"Wall-E\\" for you. That's it. That's the whole movie. Nothing more to see here. Anyone who wants to attach some pseudo-inspirational context to this mess...I advise that this is time wasted.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Classic John Ford/John Wayne western, one of my favorites of all-time (along with the Searchers).
0783240236|5.0|Still fun to watch even all these years later.<br /><br />If the birds at the park have ever buzzed you in dissatisfaction at your invading their park, you will surely enjoy this movie.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Michael Moore documentary, as you know. Like most of his movies, I think he's too one-sided, thus negating his overall argument. But this isn't as biased as Fahrenheit 911, where his 10% over-the-top allowed critics to attack the whole movie. You just know that things aren't quite as bad in US health system as he makes out, and not as perfect in the other countries as he makes out. (I'm sure you can find people in Canada, England, France and Cuba that have their own horror stories as well.) That being said, it's still a powerful and persuasive movie that genuinely asks the question - \\"Is this really the best we can do?\\"
B000F1IQN2|2.0|This movie was a disappointment to me.<br /><br />I was at the summer olympics in 1972 the day that the Palestinian terrorists killed the Jewish athletes.  Maybe this clouds my judgement.
B0010HOZS0|1.0|Not a very good movie, and I got bored halfway through. And I hated the editing.
B00003CXCT|5.0|After ordering, it came within a week and in great shape. Thank you and may the force be with you.
B000W1V7K4|3.0|Breezy summer fun, very watchable and very forgettable. Much better than 'Oceans 12', which I thought sucked, this is closer to the carefree 'Oceans 11'. Plus I'd much rather have Ellen Barkin in the movie, who is way hotter than Julia Roberts! (I never did understand Julia's appeal...)
B00192IV0O|5.0|So far, I really like this album very much. I just bought it today and most of the songs are a feel good songs with good dance beats. So far my favorite is the \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". I would definitely recommend this album. I think it's a transformation of the BEPs from Hip Hop to Dance. Frankly, Boom Boom Pow is OK with me (but they still manage to be on top) but ever since I heard that song (I gotta feeling), I bought the album.
B001EIOOWC|5.0|Another one of the best movies of the year, following up on the amazing 'History of Violence'. Viggo Mortensen has really turned into one of the great actors of this decade. And Naomi Watts looks as great ever, of course.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|I got this for my Father In Law, and he says this is the best one of the series so far.  It was hard to find in stores, so I went to Amazon.  Even with overnight delivery, it was cheeper than buying it in the store at Best Buy.  I'll never do Best Buy again.
B000M4RG42|1.0|1.  Yes, I'm comparing this movie to the book, but it's a natural thing to do... because this movie is based on the book.<br /><br />2.  With the above obvious fact being duly noted, this movie just doesn't do justice to the book.  Perhaps it's impossible for a movie to match a book; if that's the case--> then just don't even try to make a movie.<br /><br />3.  Bottomline:  just please read the book.
1416595546|2.0|I don't see it: the great love story; the sympathetic title character; or the fascinating \\"whodunit.\\"  Divided into three sections - 1916 Russia; Stalin's Moscow; and Putin's post-Soviet state - this novel definitely has potential to be a terrific story, but it remains just potential.    Sashenka's true love comes along when she is established as a 'matron' of Stalin's machine.  We are given no sense as to why she elects to have an affair other than, ultimately, she is bored and unappreciated by her torturer husband.  Only passing glimpses of an intellectual, emotional, or psychological affiliation and affection are provided in a sea of sexual passion that reduces a promising character to a figure of indifference for the reader.  We are shown two people in a passionate relationship that, for lack of any other affinity given to us by the author, is based purely upon sex.  Instead of this moment leading to the revelation of a truly complex, thinking, feeling person, we get the sum of her sexual parts - in detail.  Sashenka isn't enriched: she's cheapened.    Maybe this is appropriate, after all: Sashenka makes for a poor Bolshevik, as so many who thrived under Stalin did.  Her intellectual curiosity is still-born: we learn of her early reading, of her intellectual awakening, and then \\"boom,\\" it vanishes.  Is it no wonder that the great debates of the 1920s, when opposition to Stalin sent thousands to prison, are barely mentioned in passing?  Sashenka's interest is in following the party line as laid out by Stalin.  She benefits from it.  She has a nice house, an apartment in Moscow, and privileges the average Russian could only dream of.  She is a Stalinist.  Her \\"opposition\\", such as it is, is not because of what Stalin is doing; it's because of what Stalin is doing to her.    Sashenka sacrifices family (her father is imprisoned and exiled on Stalin's orders) and friends to retain her place in a system she doesn't understand nor strives to understand.  She is happy with her place in a fundamentally unjust social system and her only anxiety is to preserve her place.  Her intellect has been switched off like a light.  Her plight, to my mind, savors more of just desserts than tragedy.    The final section of the story contains the great mystery of her fate.  What happened to this woman?  Is she still alive?  The revelation of her end is horrifying, yes, but given Stalinist Russia, hardly surprising.  There is, however, no terrific mystery here.  If it were a snake it would bite you on the....  No Holmesian detective work is involved.  Instead, our sleuth must get former Stalinist henchmen to talk.   A little bribery, a helpful assistant, and some money thrown around, and all is revealed.      As a template for a good story this has all the right ingredients.  In execution, though, it fails.  The love story, as its written, degrades and demeans a possibly thoughtful woman by its focus on sexual passion almost to the exclusion of all else.  Sex is fine in a story, but if it overshadows and excludes all else, we are left to think this is all that counts for this character.  The central character is motivated not by great ideas or a sense of right and wrong, but how life affects her personally.  Doubtless this is what drives most people, but selfishness and self-seeking do not make a compelling, and certainly tragic, story.  Alas, also, this is not a detective story, at least not a good one.    I give this book two stars because of Mr. Montefiore's obvious grasp of place and setting.  I also give this book two stars because it's not a good story.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Loved the movie, it's all that I expected. DVD quality was excellent. Vendor is responsive and quick to ship. Probably, one of the last people who do things right the first time.
B001UV4XU6|4.0|While watching '500 Days of Summer', directed by Marc Webb, at a film festival, I was slouching in my chair, with disgustingly stale popcorn, at a theatre that desperately needed a gutting, watching the Hampton-Type, Brown University and NYFA students parading around with their tote bags and blackberries, perusing the leafleat of films for the weekend, when I pondered, for a moment, after listening to this art-house, latte drinking stiff behind me, how Joseph Gordon-Levitt, was born in Newport (which btw he certainly was not) to his two Jeannene Garofalo looking friends, how simply stunning JGL is. Not just appearance wise, but how the camera, captured radiantly by Eric Steelberg (who certainly has a keen eye towards close-up emotions) seems to nail every subtle nuance of emotion and flare of his face, however understanding the humor and often dark side of love; but his (Levitt's) pure, raw talent of the characters he portrays and the very intense subject matter and films he chooses to delve into. (I mean Mysterious Skin, are you $#@^ kidding me, how often do you see that much thrown into a role, brilliant)<br /><br />Wheeew, sorry love run-ons and stream of consciousness when I'm running with something...<br /><br />So many decent actors take awful roles with really horrible scripts and they may or may not recover, but they are working and a paycheck is a paycheck. Ok some people do this for employment, and they are really bad at it, but others are born to become other people on the screen. When I define pinnacle acting, I think of Sir Laurence Olivier, Emma Thompson, Mike York, Sam Elliott, Robin Williams, Stockard Channing, etc....so the question I pondered, while pondering why I was in a theatre on a glorious day in Newport RI, was when will the film world see how talented this guy is??!<br /><br />500 days of summer was a shocker; the wonderfully charismatic girl I brought with me, was dumbfounded at the end as well: to summarize, we both had no idea it was going to be that good. Cliche statement? Sure, but ya know what, that's about all I can muster at this moment. A sure whacky romance for the next generation of love. It is unique, different, hints of Python type humor in it, with a very grande soundtrack to boot, and amazing chemistry between Levitt and Deschanel.<br /><br />There was just the right amount of romance, humor and editing fun, to remind us that movies can still be amazing from an acting standpoint, and knowing how brutal love can be for a guy questioning, 'why just friends?', I am sure it will set hearts a glow and whisk us away into a better time, when the pure, unrefined world of romance started to make sense. Or maybe not.<br /><br />kenche statement? Sure, but ya know what, that's about all I can muster at this moment. A sure whacky romance for the next generation of love.

There was just the right amount of romance, humor and editing fun, to remind us that movies can still be amazing from an acting standpoint, and knowing how brutal love can be for a guy questioning, 'why just friends?', I am sure it will set hearts a glow and whisk us away into a better time, when the pure, unrefined world of romance started to make sense. Or maybe not.    ken

B000024ZZ0|5.0|I had Backstreet Symphony for years before I knew Thunder was so prolific. I had heard 'Dirty Love' on the radio back when it first came out and hunted it up. This album is probably just as good though I've gotten quite attached to the other one. I'm starting up my Thunder collection. If you like well-written, well-performed melodic hard rock with gritty, powerful vocals I'll be amazed if you don't like this. There's no hair metal cheese here. This is the real deal.
1607060825|4.0|The selection of art is pretty extensive for a book of this type. Almost half of it hasn't seen the inside of any of his previous art books. Unfortunately most it is familiar because it's cover art that helped to make him famous in the world of American comic books. There are some reproductions of his paintings that have lost their intensity, they're a little washed out looking.  Besides these problems this is a nice book. The people who have been buying up his many books will be happy to see the work that hasn't been in previous books. For those holding out, this is as good as they're likely to get.   This is 144 pages of fun. It's that simple. Frank Cho is a surprising talent in today's American comic book market. This book illustrates why knowing anatomy and not relying on distinctive but over-stylized, gimmick laden art is not old fashioned. Frank knows his stuff.
0596007124|5.0|I was looking for a book on the subject to enhance my knowledge about sofware design and engineering (myself has postgrad in software engineering and 10+ yrs of professional software development) and had to decide whether buy this book or the other.  I decided to pick this one instead due to my very positive experience with the other \\"Head First\\" book (HF Java).  Yes, indeed, my decision was perfect as after I read a few pages of the book, it really excites me to read even more and finish it.<br /><br />Don't just read to my comments.  There are comments from many experts included in the first few pages of the book, even from some of the \\"Gang of Four\\" (the original other Design Patterns authors)!<br /><br />I have been and always a person who like to describe things in pictures and favor books with a lot of diagrams and graphics (it has 1000 words, right?).  If you're already an expert in the area or rather like a dry-and-dull-full-of-text book, this book is not for you though.<br /><br />If you have mastered what described in this book and \\"Code Complete\\" by Steve Mcconnell, I can guarantee you will become a better software developer (these two books are now my top favorite book).

Each and every show (even the ones we remembered when they were on air) held the humor as when we saw them on CBS. The play of this \\"normal girl\\" and these socially challenged geeks is something we could all relate to. Everyone has been socially challenged, regardless of our intelligence. We can all identify with people who are different struggling to understand each other, too. THIS SET IS WORTH THE COST and THEN SOME!!!!
1891252089|5.0|David Swenson's, Ashtanga Yoga: A Practice Manual, is the best yoga book I have seen. I was recommended to buy this book by my yoga instructor to keep up with practice while away for the summer. The book goes through each individual pose, while discussing important aspects that Swenson wants the reader to know. The manual puts the different positions together in both short and long routines to help the user establish their own routine depending on time constraints and offers different options for each pose depending on the user's experience level. I recommend this book both to those who have experience and those who are just beginning!
B000QYBB6M|4.0|This is a really fun and light read, a perfect vacation read or when you're in the mood for something light but meatier than chicklit. It's very exciting with an event occurring in each chapter. The characters are very likeable, especially the protagonist.     I liked the effective description of the setting and mood of Botswana through out the book since I haven't been to Africa and it was as of I was being transported there. I also like the nuggets of introspection by the protagonist, much food for thought.      Smith's ability to write in the voice of the female protagonist is impressive, incredibly convincing.

I feel that I've re-discovered a lost treasure. And nobody can match that deep gravelly voice.
B000SXMS54|5.0|This album - fantastic! Deep, sometimes dark, one of my favorite purchases in the past month.
B0024RID60|5.0|Released in mid-1978,\\"Some Girls\\" was wildly acclaimed as \\"The Worlds Greatest Rock 'N Roll Band\\"'s return to form,thanks to such hits as the discofied #1 \\"Miss You\\",the soulful \\"Beast Of Burden\\",the sarcastic  rocker \\"Shattered\\" and album tracks like Keith's outlaw fable \\"Before They Make Me Run\\",the hillbilly-C&W parody \\"Far Away Eyes\\" and the punky \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\".It also became the band's biggest seller at the time,selling 6 million copies.The 1994 Virgin remaster was a nice stepup from the sterile 80's CBS disc,but it still sounded brittle at the top-end and a little flat IMHO.The new 2009 UMG remaster solves those problems by boosting the mid-range,slightly tighting the bass and treble,thus making the vocals and guitars much more clear and more powerful.With the exception of the album cover,the packaging is the same as the Virgin.So if sound quality is not an issue with you,keep your old one.
B001W63DX2|5.0|I picked this up for $11 at Best Buy and burned through it all in one sitting...the documentary is very cool and what I really love about these guys is that instead of frustrating us (see Black Sabbath reunion DVD) they include the uninterrupted concert on bonus DVD ...truly value and consideration shown for fans!  This is also a very good show and I felt the cutting of the concert was better than the recent batch of ADD edited shows...but that was my first impression and biased due to excitement over seeing a new show....I may change my mind with more comparison. Anybody who has agonized over the frenetically cut recent shows knows what I mean.  Nice book with the DVDs...just a darned classy package and good value by a group who kicks butt on stage and takes good care of their fans!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet, please go rent it today. Don't read other reviews, just rent this. Since I wrote this review, there are only 13 reviews that are three stars or below. The rest of the 123 reviews are four stars and above. That should tell you something in it's self. This was one of my first Eastwood movies as an actor I've ever seen. I'm happy I picked this up. Within five or so minutes I was already hooked to Eastwoods character and the film. I didn't look away for a second. The film should not bore anybody. The film is not a comedy but there were many funny moments. The story had a deep meaning and I'm sure everybody can learn from this movie. Everybody needs to see this movie. Tell your friends and don't sit around, rent it today. Enjoy.
0440539811|3.0|. . . but like every cat knows, a tangled ball of string can be a LOT of fun--especially if it's been spruced up with catnip.<br /><br />For me, \\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\\" came across as a crazy mix of FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS meets NEAL STEPHENSON meets PHILIP K DICK, a main topic of conspiracies and a writing style that JAMES JOYCE would approve of.<br /><br />There are lots of characters in this book (35, according to the appendix), but not all of them are major and not all of them are even human! Take for example the squirrel at the beginning of the novel and the well-loved Howard the Dolphin who loves improv poetry.<br />On the human side, my favorite character was Fusion Chips, a character loosely modeled after JAMES BOND.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found it hard to connect with many of the characters because the storyline bounces all over the place. One paragraph you might be reading about character A in the \\"present\\", only to find yourself reading the next about character B 20 years later (and historically speaking, that character should be dead--OR ARE THEY?!).<br /><br />So now the question may be: What drives one to finish an 800 page book that's as scatter-brained as this one? To me, it's because the main topic is conspiracies--and who doesn't like to hear a few of those every now and then?<br />The two authors discuss everything, from who really shot JFK (most hilarious!) to Aleister Crowley to HP Lovecraft to hidden meanings in numbers to dollar-bill symbolism to Atlantis and to secret organizations. If that doesn't whet your appetite, you're probably not going to make it through this book.<br /><br />I felt the novel started off strong, lagged a bit in the middle (except the parts with Howard the Dolphin), but finished strong with a very fitting ending. Even after the book is done, there are pages of appendices with even more thought-provoking information for your mind to try and pick apart as \\"true\\" or \\"false\\"--if your brain is still intact enough after having read everything else.<br /><br />Definitely not for everyone, but for those that are up to the challenge it can be a fun trip.

0765350386|5.0|Mistborn tells the story of a girl who comes to join a band of thieves who intend to pull off something no other crew has been able to- overthrow the immortal Lord Ruler. The Final Empire is the first in a trilogy, but works well as a standalone novel. The story has a satisfying ending, and you would be fine if you chose to read this book and stop. The book is so entertaining though, that you will likely want to read the other two books in the trilogy. Mistborn is a very memorable novel filled with action and unique ideas. Thoroughly recommended.

006056251X|5.0|Even before finishing the previous Wallflower book, which first introduced this novel's \\"hero\\" Sebastian St. Vincent, I had to rush out and get this one in order to read more about him. After all, how irresistible is a man described as having the face of an angel and being \\"the most desirable bed partner in England\\" - and that in a book where he plays the bad guy? That St. Vincent's debauchery and ennui at the outset appear to border on the sociopathic only increases his fascination as a protagonist, so his story had lofty expectations to meet. Fortunately, this book doesn't disappoint: the narratively treacherous progression of St. Vincent's transformation from callous roué to devoted husband is handled deftly, and the heroine Evie - nearly a nonentity in the two prior Wallflower books - finally emerges as a sufficiently independent character that her uxorious appeal to a man as jaded as St. Vincent becomes unexpectedly plausible.  The sole, ironic disappointment of this book is that St. Vincent's transformation from villain to romantic hero progressively strips him of that louche bad-boy appeal that made him so fascinating at the start. Oh well...such are the sacrifices demanded by romance, and in this case, they're worthwhile.
0143034901|3.0|This novel begins in wonderful fashion, as we quickly enter a \\"cemetery\\" which is also a vast and mysterious library, somehow tucked away in an unknown location (unless you are one of the few initiates) in the middle of Barcelona, Spain.  We seem to be entering a quasi-metaphysical world with strong mythic overtones.  A really splendid beginning, one that leaves us anticipating a great deal more in this vein.<br /><br />And yet as the book moves on, this sense of mythic promise slowly dwindles, until we are left with little more than a series of plot points--merely the `bones' of the story without the flesh of true invention.  The author layers in a very large amount of blatant exposition, thinly disguised as q. and a. with various \\"caretakers, attendants, old matrons,\\" etc. who obligingly all turn up at the right time and answer all questions put to them. No objection, no resistance, no \\"why do you want to know all this, who are you anyway?\\" type of response. It is very thin stuff and obviously exists simply to feed the reader ever more information as the \\"mystery\\" unfolds.  This is the problem with *The Shadow of the Wind*.  Its fundamental *idea* is very good, but the imaginative power needed to bring it into existence is weak.  A story needs to be fully imagined, fully created, not simply \\"defined\\" into existence as, in too large a measure, it is here.
B000RW3VD4|5.0|Wall Street is a cinematic masterpiece by Oliver Stone and Stanley Weiser; and when they say that the casting was well done they mean it! Michael Douglas in particular gives the performance of a lifetime as the villain Gordon Gekko; and there should be heaps of praise to this very day for Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox, a young, inexperienced and overeager to make money stockbroker who allows himself to be corrupted by Gekko for the sake of the almighty dollar. The plot moves along at a very good pace and the cinematography was excellent. The quality of the print is superlative and if you get the 20th Anniversary Edition there is a bonus disc with a plethora of extras!<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet some people at a stock brokerage film; and the younger ones who have fewer accounts and who need to build up their client base work in the mayhem of what was called \\"the pit\\" in real life at the time this movie was made. We meet Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) and his buddy Marvin (John C. McGinley) as they try to talk anyone into buying some stock or options or any financial vehicle so they can make a commission and pay the bills. Bud's father Carl (Martin Sheen, Charlie's father in real life) is not terribly happy that his son is a stockbroker; and he encourages Bud to give up being a \\"salesman.\\" Moreover, some of the older, more mature stockbrokers like Lou (Hal Holbrook) adhere to the value of being patient to get ahead in life. But Bud is hungry--REALLY hungry--and he calls the famously wealthy Gordon Gekko 59 days in a row in order to get Gordon's business.<br /><br />Finally, Bud does get at least some of Gordon's business and with it comes \\"perks\\" including drugs and women. Unfortunately, it also draws Bud into a world where trades are based entirely on insider information which Bud knows is illegal. Bud's greed, however, is so great that he joins forces with Gekko and sticks with him to get as much as he can for himself. Gekko even sets Bud up with a woman Bud really begins to have feelings for; Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah) was herself made rich by Gekko and Darien begins to return Bud's affection for her.<br /><br />The plot can go anywhere from here. Bud's father Carl works at Blue Star Airlines, a small carrier that was built up from the ground with hard work and honest values. Gekko, however, thinks that he and Bud can do a better job of running the airline--where might this lead? How will Bud's father Carl react to this? And what about Bud's loyalty to Gekko--will it always be there or will there eventually be a conflict of interest--and how might that play out? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!<br /><br />The 20th Anniversary Edition includes a second DVD with impressive bonus features. We get an optional audio commentary by co-writer and director Oliver Stone; a 60 minute  documentary about the film entitled \\"Greed Is Good;\\" a number of deleted scenes and a making of featurette entitled \\"\\"Money Never Sleeps: The Making of Wall Street.\\" Excellent!<br /><br />Wall Street is a powerful film that explores greed and the very high price that can be paid for living a life consumed by gluttony and materialism. This sent quite a strong message during the materialistic 1980s in America. This is definitely a morality film largely crafted by Oliver Stone; and it remains memorable after you watch it. It's not quite as stunning as Stone's movie \\"Platoon\\" but it succeeds very well without a doubt; and I highly recommend this film.have feelings for; Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah) was herself made rich by Gekko and Darien begins to return Bud's affection for her.

B0026LYM5U|4.0|The question was: can The Gathering survive the departure of one of the most versatile singers of all female fronted bands ? The answer is a clear yes, Silje Wergeland (from the norwegian band Octavia Sperati) replacing Anneke Van Giersbergen with a style which is somewhat similar and works well with the band, even though no one will forget Anneke, at least with this record.    Anneke's departure was scrutinized because of the stunning influence she had acquired over the years, leading the evolution of The Gathering from their metal origins to the alternate/experimental band of recent years. If her influence was in doubt, it is enough to listen to her own solo effort [[ASIN:B000W04RXO Air]] by Agua de Annique to realize how much of her inspiration went into The Gathering. In this sense, following her departure was more akin to replacing Neal Morse in Spock's Beard than Tarja Turunen in Nightwish.    In my mind, it is the Spock's Beard model that applies here and The West Pole evokes the same kind of transition as the immediate post-Snow efforts from the Beard; familiar sound, in a sense free from a dominating influence, but also a little more repetitive, having more difficulty looking for a direction. As a result, all the tracks are good but I don't hear yet a classic stand-out track in the lot. Perhaps a matter of getting used to the new balance.    To be clear, The West Pole is no Mandylion or Nightime Birds and The Gathering is still a way off from those glory days. But the energy is there (the wall of guitar sound of the first track When Trust Becomes Sound) and the delicate lace is there too (the completely Silje Wergeland written and composed You Promised Me a Symphony).     The most promising aspect of the new record is the extent to which Silje has already integrated with the band. Not only does her work mesh well with the guys (and gal) but she has penned seven of the ten tracks, suggesting she is game for the challenge.    With this recipe in place, not only is The West Pole a very enjoyable record but it is also a transition album that suggests a bright new life for the band.    UPDATE:  in fairness to the band, five months later, I must say that The West Pole grows on you. While it is not Mandylion or Nightime Birds, it does recapture a lot of the raw, hypnotic energy of those early gems, energy perhaps a little lost in the latter, more intimist Anneke-years albums.

0061537934|5.0|Up until now, Catch-22 has been my favorite book. While The Art of Racing in the Rain is a totally different experience, it is brilliant in its own way. It's emotional and touching all throughout. Garth Stein is a master as a writer -- keeing the writing simple, clear and deeply affecting. I will freely admit to crying, which is not something I do often.     The book also moved me to use a rare sports analogy. After reading The Art of Racing in the Rain, I told my wife: \\"In baseball, there are pitchers who are so good that it is said they could shout 'curveball' at the batter, then throw the curve. And the batter would still not be able to hit it. Garth Stein is like these master pitchers as a writer. I could see the ending coming a mile away, but Stein's work is so strong, so moving, that he moved me immensely.\\"     And mind you, this is no rookie batter or reader. Bravo, Garth Stein. I hope they make this into a movie and I hope everyone reads the book. Simply beautiful.
0375707972|5.0|This was such as great book. It's written in the voice of the teen boy (later on he's grown up). The narrative is really compelling as you see the dynamics between Michael and Hanna. Their relationship is very dysfunctional, but there definitely is chemistry there.     You want to keep reading to find out about Hanna's past as she is very secretive about it. You also keep reading to find out more about Michael as he is greatly affected by Hanna--which you realize just how deep those effects run at the end of the book. You try to imagine how his life would have been had he not met her.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|I'd never really heard of Coldplay before Viva La Vida.  I mean, I knew they existed as a band, but prior to this album, I didn't realize just how amazing a band they are.  The title song is very easy to listen to, but it is certainly not the only good song on the album.  The entire album is fairly mellow with good beats.  I use it as background music both for walking to school and doing my homework.<br /><br />After buying Viva La Vida, I purchased X&Y, Parachutes, and A Rush of Blood To the Head, and all four albums play very nicely together.  I even discovered that I knew more of Coldplay's music than I thought.  I'd highly recommend the album and, if anyone else is a new fan like me, I'd recommend trying some of their other albums as well.

1591841992|3.0|I've always admired people who can convey a complex message in a simple manner. This book shows how basic drawing skills can be used to illustrate complex concepts. And it succeeds.<br /><br />It won't teach you how to be a cartoonist or fine artist. It will teach you how to use basic shapes to draw people and processes better.<br /><br />The recent UPS commercials with the whiteboard are excellent examples of the ideas in this book.<br /><br />I wish the author used more real examples rather than devoting so many pages to why it works. We know if it works if we understand the drawings in the examples. Bottom line - more illustrations, less explanation.<br /><br />In fact, I would love to see 150 pages of illustrations and maybe only 50 pages of text. The book would then practice what it preaches.
B002ASVYWS|5.0|Hey everyone...I decided to write a review of this album even thought Steve-o below has covered all the bases and took the words right of my mouth. As a musician myself, I think each part of this band makes an important part of the overall sound and atmosphere that IS Karnivool but on this album Ian's voice, harmonies, lyrics, effect choices and emotion come shining through as never before. \\"Thermata\\" was more a focus on the band and ALL that they can do but this one is Ian's canvas to paint his beautiful soundscapes. I absolutely love \\"Sound Awake\\" because of the change and atmosphere that they have created for Ian since the last release. It Is a JOURNEY. This is not an album to skip through. Once I hear the first note of \\"Simple Boy\\" I know that I will be listening until the end of the last note on the album. This was the inspiration I needed in such a void musical landscape that the last few years has brought us. This is a shining star in an otherwise dark and very mediocre world of screaming and burping vocalists. Buy this album. Listen from start to end and enjoy the fact that the world is not completely void since Pink Floyd is gone.
B001TW69J4|5.0|I'm going to start off this review by saying this is a profound advancement in technical and progressive metal. This album is a true reflection of an incredible amount of skill that does not overbear a wonderful sense of musical taste. Overall the album is hardly repetitive, constantly shifting in mood and intensity from heavy, rhythmically interesting riffs to subtle melodies and pleasing phrases, giving this album an incredible depth and texture most new musical projects fail to deliver.    The first track, Tempting Time, seems to be a logical place to start. This song is truly staggering in every way imaginable. Beginning the song with careful use of synthesizer and sampling effects lays the foreground for a monster jackhammer riff courtesy of Tosin Abasi. The technical skill in this song is unbelievable, with such sonic intensity created and the surprising thing to note is none of this is repetitive or tiring to listen to. Midway, the song shifts to a cleanly executed 7 finger tapping line, one of my favourites in the whole album; a clear indication of the phenomenal writing and technical ability of Tosin.    The contrast of this album is a feature I find to prominent. The wonderfully delicate and tasteful Soraya almost resembles the musical variation of Scale the Summit. The jazz fusion influence is noticable throughout the album, and adds a unique dimension to each song's development. \\"Behaving Badly\\" and \\"The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing\\" are examples of this. Coupled with shifts in time signature numerous times hint an obvious Meshuggah influence, but this is definitely not even close to a Meshuggah clone album in any respect. Each song develops in its own unique way, offering a wide range of distinct musical tones that intrigue every part of the listener.     Modern Meat is another example of a wonderfully orchestrated jazz influenced track played on a detuned acoustic, which provides a reefreshing break from the onslaught of intense shift in time signature and aggressive lead playing. The lack of accompaniment gives the carefully chosen guitar phrase to develop beautifully. My only grievance is it only goes on for 2 minutes!    Overall, this album is a masterpiece. The involvement of Periphery's Misha \\"Bulb\\" Mansoor on the album of whom I am a huge fan only makes me look forward any and all new material from the project. Do not hesitate for a second. Buy this album and you will never regret it.
B000P0J0G0|3.0|A BIT OF FRY AND LAURIE was a sketch comedy programme that ran on the BBC between 1989-95 for four series (seasons in American terminology) marked by eccentric humour. It's a tiring trope to hear any British comedy programme compared to Monty Python, but I think in this case that can give you some idea of what to expect. But Fry and Laurie throw in quite a bit of highbrow or outright intellectual humour, with sketches referencing everything from De Saussure's distinction of \\"langue\\" and \\"parole\\" in linguistics to Plato's notion of forms and the commonplaces of the Tolkien-style fantasy genre. Sometimes we find metacomedy, where a sketch is interrupted halfway through, and the comedians address the camera, or we even cut to another sketch where Fry and Laurie play critics analysing the last. The comedic dynamic is based on the opposition of these two comedians, with Laurie the often scatterbrained funny guy and Fry the prim straight man. Both Fry and Laurie are quite talented in imitating other English accents, from Australian to Scottish, although only Laurie successfully manages American and working class UK accents. With many of the sketches are perennial, others are very much if its time, capturing the political polemics, celebrity scandals, \\"Yuppie\\" phenomenon and popular music of the time. Far from making it unpleasantly dated, in my experience these facets only add to the humour.<br /><br />I think the first season is the strongest, and then the quality progressively declines. From the second season everything seems too glossy and contrived, with the beginning episodes had a sort of amateur charm to them. We get too many of Hugh Laurie's musical sketches, some of which aren't even comedic anymore. In the final series, guests appear on each episode, which pushes Fry and Laurie out of their own programme. Therein lies a conundrum, for I cannot recommand the complete DVD set to just anyone, because they may not enjoy all or even most of it. However, I cannot recommend just getting the set of the first series because then, if you like it and want to see more, it'll cost so much more to get the complete set. However, this programme is floating around out there, and I think if you previewed it first you'd have a better idea of whether the complete set or even just the release of the first series is worth it.st getting the set of the first series because then, if you like it and want to see more, it'll cost so much more to get the complete set.

B001NLL8LA|4.0|As always, I enjoyed this novel, having read all of the previous books in the past year, it was great to have Reacher up to speed on technology that was missing in the earlier books.  (I had to remember that Jack was 10 or so years in the past).  No real romantic attachments, and a good male counter point in the out of town brother to the \\"terrorist\\" who turns out, well I won't spoil it for you.  Enjoy the book.
B00004VWAF|4.0|It has become a trope to say that ON THE CORNER is Miles Davis' most forward-looking album in spite of its lack of sales when it was released in 1972. It's an electronics extravaganza, with Miles combining his trumpet with a wah-wah pedal, Herbie Hancock's piano recorded through a ring modulator, and producer Teo Macero liberally cutting up and rearranging the recording sessions and putting a host of special effects on top.<br /><br />I'm sure many listeners will feel a tinge of anxiety over who exactly is responsible for the final product, as Macero evidentally worked his magic without consultation with Miles, and some of the great bandleader's musicians reportedly didn't recognize their own work when the album came out. Nonetheless, get over your authorship hangups straightaway, because the album is good listening. At this point Miles wanted his bassist Michael Henderson to hold down a strict funk groove, centering the music in a way uncharacteristic of jazz even though every other musician is heavily improvising. Then there's the addition of a sitar, tabla drums and bass clarinet to Miles' troupe, creating a far out mix of sounds. Miles' trumpet is less brash and in-your-face than on other recordings of the fusion era, and it sounds more like he's gently guiding his virtuoso bandmates to show their stuff.<br /><br />Even today a lot of listeners put the record on and instantly conclude that it is noise. I think much of this is due to the track order. Starting off with the long and heavy medley \\"On the Corner/New York Girl/Thinking of One Thing and Doin' Anyother/Vote for Miles\\" just gives you an intimidating blast. I'd recommend instead skipping straight to the second track, \\"Black Satin\\", which at 5:20 is more easily digestible and immediately lays out all the technological effects that made the album something special.<br /><br />Though ON THE CORNER foretells to some extent the rise of house and electronica, it is dated in some ways. Some of Macero's edits, especially those moving instruments around in the stereo space, are clumsy. And the 1969 BREW has, I think, the better musicianship. Nonetheless, ON THE CORNER is a strong effort and an album that deserves to be heard even by those contemporary audiences that consider jazz antiquated.struments around in the stereo space, are clumsy.

B001KVZ6FM|4.0|Six of us saw Up together in 3-D.  And, for starters, there's no need to pay the extra $ for the 3-D version, which is mostly a slightly greater depth to the screen, not a bit more intense than your average Imax.    So it was a 9 month old, a 5 year old, an 8 year old, my early 30's daughter and son-in-law and me.  Three of us fell asleep for at least part of the movie -- OK, the baby hardly counts but she was one of the three.  We all liked it, but none of us said, \\"Let's see it again.\\"  Any movie that sets as its protagonist a 78 year old curmudgeon is, of course, very welcome and the lifelong love story that sets the film in motion is perfect and over too soon.  Carl's journey is sometimes exciting, sometimes funny, pretty meandering, and all that is fine, but the interest level of his adventures varies considerably -- hence the cat naps.  My favorite line, voiced several times by one or another of the jungle dogs, was \\"ooohh, the cone of shame,\\" a sentiment shared, I feel confident, by any poor dog or cat that has worn one of those funnel-shaped neck collars after a visit to the vet.    See Up, but in originality and entertainment be aware that it ranks a cut below the standard set by another Pixar film, The Incredibles.
B001TI9N7I|4.0|I have a hard time giving a positive review to a book that I disliked so much. But I can't say that this book wasn't carefully crafted, dense with detail, and compelling. A well crafted complete and logical mystery is so rare a gem that I will recommend this to anyone who likes mysteries. That said, I am squeamish about about the irrelevant sexuality and the frank and brutal sexual abuse that is a thread throughout the plot. The mystery would have been every bit as compelling if the abuse were not so violent twisted and deprave. I have read and enjoyed books with violent themes. Cormac McCarthy's The Road and Blood Meridian were both unrelentingly violent, but they were books about what it takes to survive violence. In this book sex and sexual violence add nothing to the tension or our understanding of the characters. There aren't worth the discomfort.<br /><br />The characters in this book are distinct individuals with interesting relationships but the details of the business they are in and the stuff around them are so specific, you get the feeling the book was written on a spread sheet. I hate that the author constantly refers to computers, software, car models, and travel equipment by brand-name and model number, as if it communicates something specific and universal that she drinks from a PET water-bottle, while they work side by side on their 15 inch, and 17 inch iBook G3 and G4 respectively.<br /><br />The family history of the central mystery is so sprawling detailed and complex, I'm sure the author used some kind of database to keep track of them all. The complexity of the case has the texture of reality because it is just so vast, which just makes it all the more artificial when details get wrapped up and the sleuths take charge of it all.<br /><br />The Deus ex machina comes out of information technology that we are just supposed to grant within a book that is otherwise so grounded in detail that you can feel the wood grain.<br /><br />Read it if you like a good mystery, you don't mind the elements of sexual violence, and obsessive cataloging of details doesn't bother you.ind the elements of sexual violence, and obsessive cataloging of details doesn't bother you.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Full disclosure once again (I've said it on other Cohen products I've reviewed) -- for me, Leonard Cohen can do practically no wrong.  I have seen three concerts during his version of the Neverending Tour -- Toronto back a June ago when it was just getting underway, April in Seattle, May at Radio City Music Hall in NYC.  I intend to see as many more as I can before it ends, and I hope it never does.      Meanwhile, Live in London relives them every time I put it in the DVD.  The camera work here is pretty basic, but the closeups show just how much fun Cohen and his merry band are having as they perform.  It is all choreographed and that's fine.  I think the song list here in London varied by one from NYC and two from Seattle.  Most of us don't go for spontaneity, but for Leonard's history and his poem stories and for his multiangled take on life.  Some of it can be very somber, but as he commented in Seattle, even in the bad times \\"cheerfulness\\" keeps breaking through.  He's 74, he's produced a tremendous body of work, he's surrounded himself with wonderful individual collaborators, musicians, and backup singers, he wears a battered fedora, he gives you nearly three hours of performance, and he skips off stage at the end.  The man knows how to live.     There, one more five star review -- buy the DVD!

B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica follow up \\"Kill 'Em All\\" with a keener sense of structure and  artistic approach. On their sophomore recording, the boys demonstrate a natural ability to build tension, balance dissonance and consonance, orchestrate melody and harmony and find resolution. They didn't just raise the bar, they went to another dimension and still somehow topped themselves on the next few records. Arguably, each album stands by itself and is a testament to anyone who dreams, while inspiring new generations to just do it.<br /><br />This album contains many sides to the band that, good and bad, shocked it's audience.<br />\\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" - Deceptively starts the album at 82 bpm with a beautiful and serene atmosphere (a metaphor for a peaceful, unsuspecting public during the cold war era) that suddenly erupts like an explosion to 184 bpm, blasting the listener unrelentlessly for almost five minutes, proving they could be beautifully ugly when they felt like it. This song bashes your face in. Awesome!<br />\\"Ride The Lightning\\" - The song starts with a dissonant harmony that resolves to a dissonant rhythm. Later in the song the solo guitar performs a triplet harmony that morphs into a sixteenth harmony seamlessly, a feat not easily accomplished but executed masterfully here.<br />\\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" - A solemn bell sets the cadence, warning of the approaching harmonized bass figure. Who harmonizes bass guitar? Cliff, that's who and he does it well. Wow, this song is awesome. Drums lay down a strong backbone for the rhythm figures and guitar harmonies, while tossing out fills when appropriate. The lyrics focus on the horrors of war as described by Ernest Hemingway. I still wonder where these guys went after 1992.<br />\\"Fade To Black\\" - Awesome song with some stirring emotional moments. The solos, the acoustic verse riffs, the ending double bass figure that builds and builds, the lost feeling and the fade out totally serve every second of this song.<br />\\"Trapped Under Ice\\" - Not a favorite, but rhythmically it explores more land Metallica was conquering.<br />\\"Escape\\" - an ode to Iron Maiden's \\"The Prisoner\\": again, not a favorite, but it's another experiment in the dissonant world.<br />\\"Creeping Death\\" - Being a Christian, The fact that the lyrics are a condensed version of the book of Exodus is just awesome. The repeating rhythmic percussive phrase and chant of \\"Die\\" every other beat is beyond powerful. It's an anthem and something many have tried to copy but can't reproduce.<br />\\"The Call of Ktulu\\" - This song is a symphonic poem. Listening to the song paints some very graphic pictures in one's head. I can just envision this giant climbing out of the sea destroying the corrupted world and then going back to sleep in the depths of the ocean. This instrumental is epic.<br /><br />Melodically and contrapuntally, this albums goes where Metallica has never been before. James, Lars, Kirk, and more so Cliff, added a dimension that served the music and, a purposely overlooked, genre very well, giving it credence while the arrogant world still looked the other way.Ice\\" - Not a favorite, but rhythmically it explores more land Metallica was conquering.<br />\\"Escape\\" - an ode to Iron Maiden's \\"The Prisoner\\": again, not a favorite, but it's another experiment in the dissonant world.<br />\\"Creeping Death\\" - Being a Christian, The fact that the lyrics are a condensed version of the book of Exodus is just awesome.

1423101472|5.0|Rick Riordan's series starring Percy Jackson and his demigod companions from Camp Half-Blood has brought Greek mythology vividly to life for a whole new generation of readers. Riordan manages to meld contemporary life with classical mythology, all the while imprinting his novels with clever humor and dynamic characters. The formula has worked perfectly; each book's popularity has grown, and millions of fans have been clamoring for the final volume ever since the publication of THE BATTLE OF THE LABYRINTH in 2008.    Now, with THE LAST OLYMPIAN, the wait is over. Fans of the series know that Riordan has been building suspense for the ultimate battle between the renegade Titans and the demigods of Camp Half-Blood. Over the course of four previous books, the Titans have grown stronger and gained support, but Percy himself --- as well as several of his friends --- has grown from a confused and awkward boy questioning his identity and heritage to a capable and courageous leader. In this final adventure, the two forces collide, and the result is spectacular indeed.    Throughout THE LAST OLYMPIAN, Percy is troubled by dreams and prophecies. Some are open to interpretation, but others seem to foresee certain doom for Percy and his forces. Summoning all his courage and uniting his forces proves tougher than Percy had anticipated, especially when some of the internal conflicts at Camp Half-Blood threaten to sabotage his plans (it's hard to win a war without the children of Ares cooperating with you!). The battlefield for this final conflict is, in true Riordan style, the streets of Manhattan, centering on Mount Olympus (known to us mortals as the Empire State Building).    As the casualties mount, loyalties are tested, sometimes strengthened and other times broken. Riordan manages to introduce some new characters and elements from Greek mythology (including Pandora's Box and the sleep-inducing god Morpheus) while simultaneously reaching back to Percy's very first adventure to bring back familiar friends and enemies. Even Percy's most essential relationships --- with the satyr Grover and love interest Annabeth Chase --- evolve and deepen over the course of this last novel. Percy's final adventure is the most sophisticated, serious and mature of his life, but the book never loses its sense of humor or fun: \\"The campers down at the volleyball pit had early '90s hairstyles, which were probably good for keeping monsters away.\\"    Most readers will finish THE LAST OLYMPIAN exhilarated by the epic final battle and deeply satisfied by the way Riordan ties up his characters' professional, personal and romantic lives. For those who just can't get enough of Percy Jackson, however, the entire series is destined for immortality --- and even more fans --- once the first movie based on the novels hits theaters in 2010.       --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl
0316017922|4.0|Like Gladwell's other books, Outliers helps us to look beyond mere appearances and conventional 'wisdom' and consider other factors that better or more fully explain the world. In the world of the super-achievers, conventional wisdom is that hard work and raw ability are the deciding factors.  Another line of conventional wisdom is that super-achievers are those in the right place at the right time.  Outliers takes the analysis of this second princple to its logical extreme. At one level it is tempting to over simplify and dismiss the book's premise as suggesting that 'things are the way they are - because they are the way they are.' Some are also critical of the book because it seems to discount the impact of hard work and raw ability.  I think Gladwell assumes hard work and raw ability among his outliers and tries to understand what separates one genius from another.  Therefore, the better view is to accept Gladwell's challenge to see how the complex interaction of seemingly unrelated factors conspire to create trends and outcomes that are, in theory, entirely predictable. Great read!
0141439793|4.0|A man reading Jane Austen is a bit like a woman watching an old Chicago Bull's title series - you don't want to do it at first, you pretty much knows how it ends, but it is surprisingly captivating.  With that being said, this is an enjoyable book with a predictable ending but an interesting path.  The extensive scenes in Bath are intrinsically rewarding due to their humor and the knowledge that girlish precociousness has made it through to the 21st century pretty much intact.  For the 99.99% of the world's population unfamiliar with 2nd and 3rd tier 18th century Gothic novels, the end notes to this edition are required to understand the parody.      Plotline: girl goes to Bath, girl meets first 'friend' and then a true friend, girl visits big scary Abbey only to find out it is not actually the subject of her juvenile fantasy stemming from Gothic romances, girl falls in love, love is condemned, love conquers all.  The narrative is very funny in parts, and always lively.  One traditional criticism that holds true in my eyes is the uneven split between the first 3/4 (Bath) and the last 1/4 (the Abbey).  Other than that, I have to say it is probably better than 75-80% of what modern writers can put out on their best day.
B00192IV0O|4.0|The Black Eyed Peas return with a club/dance orientated \\"The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies)\\". This was easily, for me, one of their best efforts. The entire cd is infused with great beats, energetic vibes and the group's usual playful lyrics. What I enjoyed about \\"The E.N.D.\\" is how it is not like anything on the radio right now. There are bouncy tracks such as \\"Alive\\" that, with even being something of a ballad, is still very pop/hip-hop and keeps a classic R&B song vibe to it. I think it was genius of the group to find a way to make a record filled with danceable hits instead of just having one or two songs and having the rest of the cd be filler tracks.<br /><br />Some stand out tracks are \\"Alive\\", \\"Rock That Body\\", \\"Missing You\\", \\"Imma Be\\" and \\"Meet me Half Way\\". I felt like the cd takes on a rather different vibe mid-way through, leaving behind the remix/club scene for a more stripped down, less computer-ized sound that works best on tracks like \\"Generation Now\\" and \\"One Tribe\\". The tracks not mentioned weren't bad, but after one or two listens they don't stand out as much and seem rather average and underwhelming compared to the true party/club anthems that kick-off \\"The E.N.D.\\".  If there is a weakness to the release it's that with so many tracks having such big production and a fast-paced club treatment, a lot of the tracks sort of feel like one long continuous track rather than seperate songs which can make the listening experience feel a bit drawn out and lacking in parts.<br /><br />There is a deluxe edition being sold at Target, but I'm not convinced it's worth purchasing. The bonus tracks on it are just okay but I feel like the best tracks, for once, actually made it onto the regular edition. I liked the idea of the deluxe edition also giving the club/dance treatment to some of the groups past popular songs like \\"Pump It\\", \\"Let's Get Retarded\\", and \\"Don't Phunk With My Heart\\" but some of these remixes/reworkings were a bit of a miss and don't live up to the original version.<br /><br />In all, a great release from the Black Eyed Peas and a cd actually worth buying and owning. If you're looking for catchy beats, witty lyrics, club-tracks that sound like they're already remixed, then this is for you.

Diesel's appearance also seems to trigger the arrival of another mysterious being named, Wulf Grimoire.  Wulf is really scary, but also happens to be Diesel's cousin and seems to come from the darker side of the world!    To add even more zany interest to PLUM SPOOKY, there's also another character, a monkey named Carl, who Stephanie is caring for while his owner is away. Carl can't talk, but communicates very well with hand signals and a few monkey sounds. He seems to have the capacity to make himself completely understood.     If you like the Stephanie Plum stories, don't miss this one! It made me laugh out loud!

B001DDBCUK|5.0|I was very pleased with my order! It arrived very fast and it was in perfect condition, case, cd, artwork, everything was perfect! Definitely would buy from this seller, again!
6304698690|4.0|I was in the mood to see this movie again and was super excited for its arrival. I took off the plastic and put the DVD in without looking at it. When I turned it on, the menu for \\"A Little Princess\\" was on my screen. The wrong DVD was actually in the \\"The Secret Garden\\" box, wrapped in plastic and everything. I was able to send it back and have it replaced. However, it was a lot of inconvenience for an inexpensive movie I could have bought at Wal-Mart.
0393327345|5.0|If I had to describe this book in one word it would be unapologetic. Once it starts it never stops and questions itself. The characters are all as flawed as people you know in real life, the plot is so complex you almost feel it happened.    It starts with an insomniac trying to feel by going to support groups and that's when he meets the girl who will change his life. The fight club is established and becomes a front to something much bigger. The whole book leads you by the throat to it's climax where it dangles you over the edge as you watch for it to all come to an end.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|After the death of his longtime love, Carl (Asner) decides to fulfill one of their long term goals.  This is a visit to Paradise Falls, deep in South America.  A former balloon salesman, he ties thousands of helium-filled balloons to his house and takes off.  Meanwhile, Russell (Nagai), a youngster who is trying to \\"help an old person\\" is caught on the porch.  Russell is along for the ride, and when they get to their destination, things are not what they expected.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is the tenth film by Pixar, and also their tenth great film.  It seems that they can do no wrong, and show no signs of slipping.  This is a movie for all ages to enjoy, like their previous endeavors.  Asner is the perfect choice to play the grumpy old man Carl, and Nagai is likewise great as young Russell.  The colors are vibrant and eye-catching.  As for the 3-D effects, they are probably the most subtle I have ever seen on film.  They are effective, but not distracting.  I highly recommend \\"Up\\" for all ages.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Let's face it, we've become pretty sophisticated, which means that Frankenstein and Godzilla don't really cut it anymore.  And the hack-n-slash gorefest crap that passes for horror these days is almost not worth the time it takes to yawn through them.  So when I find a good, solid monster movie that makes me tense up and say \\"Oh my god!\\" at least once, I know I'm on to something.<br /><br />If you don't already know, Cloverfield is set in post-9/11 Manhattan.  During a Bon Voyage party, something attacks the city, decapitating the Statue of Liberty, in a very memorable moment, and laying waste to the Empire State building, the two most enduring symbols of New York.  Add to that the memory of the events of September 2001, and you have the sense that this story isn't going to end well.<br /><br />There's a breakneck race through the streets and subways of Manhattan, and ever-longer peeks at the monster and its spawn, but there's never enough time to take it all in, never time to allow the mind to process exactly what it is that's happening, so the imagination takes over, which any old school horror aficionado will tell you is the most effective way to scare the bejeebers out of someone.  Let their mind do the work for you, let them imagine what is happening, what could happen, what will happen.<br /><br />The casting of relative unknowns and the use of a near-real-time narrative are both critical to allowing the audience to put itself into the story.  I only saw one actor with whom I was familiar, and it did push me right out of the film for a moment because it suddenly registered as just a movie, an entertainment.  Until that moment I was very caught up in the narrative.  I know that when I'm sitting forward in my chair urging the characters to \\"follow the rats, always follow the rats!\\" that I've been quite properly hooked.<br /><br />In the end, Cloverfield is really nothing more than a monster movie for the 21st century, but one which doesn't depend on blood and gore, or some lunatic with a butcher knife.  It's good fun.er knife.  It's good fun.
1439138311|4.0|This is a beautiful book.  The simplicity with which Toibin tells the story of Eilis, an Irish immigrant to New York in the early '50s, is deceptive: it is the product of skillful pace and control.  No word is superfluous.    Without taking easy options or resorting to obvious devices, the author manages to reveal the depth of Eilis's feelings and her slow awakening. It would be easy, for example, to deliver her sense of loss and helplessness through an account of the trauma of her original departure from her mother and her home in County Wexford.  But Toibin is far too subtle for that.  Details of the actual farewell are skipped: instead Eilis's feelings seep slowly out of subsequent pages that convey her bewilderment and sense of alienation.  Here is writing that eloquently confirms that the sound of the gong is outlasted by its echo.  My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that I found Eilis's lack of curiousity about her new world frustrating. I am sure there are many immigrants like her, but there were times when her passivity provoked more than a sigh.  But that's a minor exasperation.  All in all, a very compelling read.

B001V7R09A|5.0|DG only caught Richter on disc for six years (1956-62), but what years they were. Of the nine discs he made, several are among his greatest concerto recordings (the Schumann, Rachmaninov Second, Prokofiev Fifth), with the solo music scarcely at a lower level.  Issuing all his LPs in their original order is an idea the company used with Martha Argerich previously. It's not really much of an advantage, though, and despite the reduced price, anyone interested in Richter will already own the bulk of this collection, little of which has been out of print or hard to find on the used market.<br /><br />Here's the complete contents:<br /><br />Bach, J S:<br /> Prelude & Fugue Book 1 No. 1 in C major, BWV846<br />Prelude & Fugue Book 1 No. 4 in C sharp minor, BWV849<br />Prelude & Fugue Book 1 No. 5 in D major, BWV850<br />Prelude & Fugue Book 1 No. 6 in D minor, BWV851<br />Prelude & Fugue Book 1 No. 8 in E flat minor, BWV853<br /><br />Beethoven:<br /> Rondo for Piano and Orchestra in B flat major, Wo06<br />Wiener Symphoniker, Kurt Sanderling<br /><br />Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor, Op. 37<br />Wiener Symphoniker, Kurt Sanderling<br /><br />Chopin:<br /> Ballade No. 3 in A flat major, Op. 47<br /><br />Polonaise No. 7 in A flat major, Op. 61 'Polonaise-fantaisie'<br /><br />&Eacute;tude Op. 10 No. 1 in C major<br />&Eacute;tude Op. 10 No. 12 in C minor `Revolutionary'<br />Ballade No. 4 in F minor, Op. 52<br /><br />Debussy:<br /> Pr&eacute;ludes - Book 1: No. 2, Voiles<br />Pr&eacute;ludes - Book 1: No. 3, Le vent dans la plaine<br />Pr&eacute;ludes - Book 1: No. 5, Les collines d'Anacapri<br /><br />Estampes (3) (Complete)<br /><br />Haydn:<br /> Piano Sonata No. 32 in G minor, Hob.XVI:44<br /><br />Mozart:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K466<br />Warsaw (National) Philharmonic Orchestra, Witold Rowicki<br /><br />Prokofiev:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 5 in G major, Op. 55<br />Warsaw (National) Philharmonic Orchestra, Witold Rowicki<br /><br />Piano Sonata No. 8 in B flat major, Op. 84<br /><br />Visions fugitives, Op. 22, No. 3<br />Visions fugitives, Op. 22, No. 6<br />Visions fugitives, Op. 22, No. 9<br /><br />Rachmaninov:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18<br />Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, Stanislaw Wislocki<br /><br />Prelude Op. 32 No. 1 in C major<br />Prelude Op. 32 No. 2 in B flat minor<br />Prelude Op. 23 No. 2 in B flat major<br />Prelude Op. 23 No. 4 in D major<br />Prelude Op. 23 No. 5 in G minor<br />Prelude Op. 23 No. 7 in C minor<br />Prelude Op. 32 No. 12 in G sharp minor<br /><br />Schubert:<br />Allegretto in C minor, D915<br />L&auml;ndler in A major (from 17 L&auml;ndler, D366)<br /><br />Schumann:<br /> March in G minor, Op. 76, No. 2<br /><br />Waldszenen (Forest Scenes) Op. 82<br /><br />Fantasiest&uuml;cke, Op. 12 (selection)<br /><br />Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54<br />Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra, Witold Rowicki<br /><br />Introduction & Allegro appassionato in G major, Op. 92<br />Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra, Stanislaw Wislocki<br /><br />Novelette in F major, Op. 21 No. 1<br /><br />Toccata in C major, Op. 7<br /><br />Abegg Variations, Op. 1<br /><br />Scriabin:<br /> Piano Sonata No. 5 in F sharp major, Op. 53<br /><br />Tchaikovsky:<br /> Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor, Op. 23<br />Wiener Symphoniker, Herbert von Karajan<br /><br />You will know from your own buying which of these recordings are missing. EMI has a similar box set in their \\"Icons\\" series that contains recordings which qualify as being a bit rare, given that EMI is quick with the deletion pen. I believe that there are alternate versions of every piece here, since Richter's discography of live concerts is vast.  For me and millions of fans, DG isn't exaggerating to call Richter the pianist of the century -- the latter half, at least -- and so his every note was captured by someone with a tape recorder.<br /><br />These \\"private\\" recordings, as well as the official ones from Melodiya,  usually can't compete with DG's sound, which is why I point to the concertos in particular.  Critics have argued against the Tchaikovsky and the Mozart D minor for various reasons; the others are incontrovertibly great. Not everyone appreciates Richter's Bach and Chopin, either, but everything else in the solo recitals exhibits is overwhelming musical command., which is why I point to the concertos in particular.

1400097029|5.0|If you've heard the term literary fiction and wondered what the hell that means, read this novel by John Banville. Banville, the Irish novelist and journalist, writes literary fiction. By the way, he also writes crime fiction, under the pseudonym, Benjamin Black. The Sea tells an intriguing story creatively and in beautiful prose that constantly encourages one to reread whole sections for the shear enjoyment of it. What more can one ask? Read this book. If you love to read, you will treasure the experience.
B002BI4Y06|5.0|At $0.99/per song, buying the seventeen songs on this album individually comes to $16.83, but Amazon is charging $16.99 for a download of the entire album.  You're not getting any kind of bonus for the extra money.  Sure, it's only 16 cents, but that adds up as you purchase more albums from Amazon...and it's your money.

B001V9LRTM|5.0|This is one deluxe edition I personally have been waiting 20 years for. What is so astonishing is that the edition of this film in print for the last 10 years was an awful transfer(amazing what we'll put up with when there is no alternative)so awful that watching this in HI-DEF is truly like seeing it again for the first time. It is about time stellar unseen performances are at our disposal to view. The Dead's \\"Turn on your love light\\" is amazing! The vibrant colors and true hues can be seen for real and proper aspect ratio intact. Even though single panel frames can make one think of \\"gutter-boxing\\", the picture stays balanced throughout. No blow-ups of single frames to simply fill space. Also, no disc to flip or change because the entire picture is on one disc thanks to Blu-ray's incredible info capacity. The clarity is amazing. Just viewing it today I have noticed certain bits here and there I never noticed before which is saying something considering I have seen this film probably more than any other. The box packaging is clever but is mere excess filler. Every and anything you could want is contained all on those 2 little discs. I did however buy the standard 2 disc edition so I can see it on my 720p TV. Just fantastic. Thanks WB!

0141301104|5.0|Growing up, this was my favorite book and also one of my favorite movies.  I read the reviews in which raters gave this book a one star or two star.  All I have to say is that this book is a FANTASY book; That is why the author can portray people as being witches. (In general, every piece of literature has a protagonist and an antagonist as characters)   It is not to offend anyone, it is to expose children to fantasy and allowing children to use their imagination.  As a teacher, I have this book in my classroom and the children go crazy over it! They can not get enough of this book! They do not take this text seriously, they think it is silly that woman dress up, children can be mice, etc.  I would definitely recommend this book!!! Open your imagination to where ANYTHING is possible!
0920668364|4.0|A really good read.  And a keeper.  Better suited, perhaps, for reading to slightly older kids.  But it's equally for the parent who reads it. That's how I felt as I read it for the first time, to my preschoolers. I couldn't help the tears.  The story isn't a conventional one & I can see how some may question aspects of it.  However that doesn't detract from its central message.  It expresses how I feel about my kids - an enduring, unconditional love - despite the messiness of the process of growing up with them.  I'm sure I will revisit this book many times with my kids as they grow.  And I will share this with other parents I know.  I sense they will find it equally rewarding.  Perhaps you will too.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|When I first saw this movie I was like this looks really dumb. Then after I watched it I wanted to watch it over and over again. The plot is deep and the dub is perfect.

0307383415|4.0|Barak Obama has penned a delightful examination of his unique childhood, painted in the light of retrospection and illuminated with interesting anecdotal illustration.  His writing style is direct, concise, descriptive and never tiresome.<br /><br />While the reader may yearn for a deeper description of Obama's mother, as well as his early life in Indonesia, it must be acknowledged that few of us can write meticulous descriptions of our early childhood.  We obtain greater insight into personality development from his life in Hawaii and more so in New York and Chicago.  Obama's relationship with his maternal grandmother is deep, delightful and penetrating.<br /><br />\\"Dreams from My Father\\" offers a well-paced examination of American attitudes towards race, culture, urban life and social problems.  Obama's frustrations as a social activist uncovers a detailed depiction of the racial divide that continues to plague America, long after his early years.<br /><br />Obama paints his father as a larger-than-life figure, replete with African mysticism and stilted by prolonged absence, made all the more compelling by his father's untimely demise.  One can sense desperation in Obama's description of his long-absent father, mitigated somewhat by tracing his heredity, from Kansas to Kenya.  He yearns for his African brothers and sisters, whom he barely knows.<br /><br />This is also a book about belonging.  Obama searches for his roots and finds that he belongs to three worlds; the white world of his mother and maternal grandparents, the black world of his adolescence and adulthood and the African world of his father.  Disparate, tightly wound and highly sensitive, this is the story of a boy who is forced to live with strangers in a strange land and a man who continues to search for a world in which he perfectly belongs.  He desires a society that will fit him like a glove, yet he cannot discern it.  Instead, he discovers layers of impenetrable social strata, filled with fear, animosity and rejection.  He learns that he is a man for all seasons and all societies.<br /><br />\\"Dreams of My Father\\" is non-fiction that reads like a novel.  Fast paced and compelling, Obama weaves a tale of family and society that breathes with emotional clarity.  His divided heritage eventually becomes reconciled with comfort and security.  The bitterness of his heritage drops away, leaving only the man we today admire.<br /><br />Charles S.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I've been waiting for a recorder like this for a while. My wish list was this: to be able to simultaneously record my band playing live from the mixing board feed, while also capturing the room ambience and audience sounds... in stereo... with a compact easy-to-use recorder. The H4n fit the bill perfectly, and I bought it right away, not even realizing that it had many OTHER features!    I didn't realize that it was a stereo USB audio interface. I didn't realize that it came with Cubase LE. I didn't realize that it came with a really nice hardshell case instead of a cheap nylon bag. And it came with a really odd tapered handle that I soon realized was used to mount it onto a microphone stand! Zoom really seems to have listened to the reviewers of their previous models (both here and in the music magazines and websites), and improved the product with this new model. It feels very solid, the rubberized texture is nice, and the LCD screen is large and clear. There are some great features, like the limiters, that are real pro-level options. I get the feeling that actual recording engineers were consulted at the design phase.    The UI is a little bit cumbersome and not immediately intuitive. You DO have to read the instructions, because some of the settings are really buried. However, once you get used to it, you'll find that there are a lot of buttons on it that are actually very useful. I especially like how you can quickly adjust the recording levels. I suppose that the more I use it, the more comfortable I'll feel. After a month using it (and actually only 2 real events that I've recorded with it) I still keep that manual close at hand.     One more thing: it is BIG! If you're thinking hand-held \\"voice recorder\\" like the little ones that reporters use, this is its BIG brother. For those of us old enough to remember, it's about the size of an old Sony Walkman cassette player, and isn't easily stuffed into a pocket. Not a spy gadget by any stretch; with this baby in your hand, people will KNOW you're recording them!    Overall though, I am very pleased with it, and am happy with the recording quality. I expect that I will be buying the remote control as well, based on the many reviewers who have mentioned recording noise created while holding it in your hand. You do have to be very mindful of not moving your hands on it while recording, as the mics WILL pick it up!
0061002593|5.0|The product description is so unjust that I just felt I had to say something about it - it completely misrepresents the story and does the hero much injustice.     By this point, I've read most of Georgette Heyer's historical romances - I've enjoyed most of them, liked some of them less, but Venetia definitely counts as one of my favourites. Heyer has written many exciting stories, but the writing really stands out in this one. There were many passages that alternatively struck me, or took my breath away, and by the time I finished reading it, I knew that this one was for keeps. Very intelligent hero and heroine and really, a very intelligent book, full of literary references - and very cleverly used too.    At some points the plot did feel rather disjointed and one-sided, but it all worked out in the end - these are characters that surprise you in their nuances, and really make you feel for them.     Don't be fooled by the product description - I assure you that Venetia's man is much more than that
B001KVZ6FM|4.0|Pixar keeps raising the bar - and this time it's Up. This joyous fantasy creates a very odd couple indeed. An iconic grumpy old man and a congenitally cheerful and sincere little boy launch onto an adventure blended from equal parts past (the old guy's) and future (the kid's). There's bit of an eco-fable in there, with the big bad urban developers and the rapacious hunter, but that never becomes annoying. Instead, Up keeps delivering wild sight gags layered on appealing interactions between the characters. Speaking of characters (and speaking of them speaking), Dug the dog is way up on my list of favorites. If you never learned to love dog-drool as a child, he might not hit a heart-string - but that's your problem, not mine.<br /><br />I'm sure others will tell you about the rest of the movie, but two parts really stood out for me: the first five minutes, and the ten minutes (or so) before that. Those first few minutes of the movie create a charming back-story with more plot and heart than a lot of movies manage in an hour or two. They define The Quest that the rest of the movie pursues, so effectively that you'll never question any silliness in pursuing it. But, before the first minutes of this movie, Pixar presents one of their signature short features. This time - well, it would take longer to tell than to watch. It's about the stork who delivers the babies. It carries an affectionate reminder that some are harder to love than others, but that just makes the job that much more important.<br /><br />-- wiredweird<br /><br />(PS: Note how much more limber and energetic the old guy gets as he spends more time with that earnest little boy - that part of the movie is absolute non-fiction. Young kinds make you younger.)
B000A3DFZE|1.0|This is the musical equivalent of having to look at photos of someone else's kids. It's nice that life has improved for Eric, he's had very rough times in the past so he deserves it, and he obviously loves his children but great music usually comes from hungry, tormented artists. The giveaways: string arrangements, the kiss of death for any hope of edginess in rock, jazz, or blues. Despite the all-star line-up of great musicians, including Robert Randolph, John Mayer, and the late great Billy Preston, this album is about as interesting as an egg salad sandwich.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This mini series accurately depicts our founding fathers' struggle to create the freest society ever created in the history of the world.  It is amazing how you can take our founding fathers' vision of a free society and compare it to today's America and see how off course we have become as a nation.  I highly recommend this for anyone who loves history.  It is one thing to read about it, but another thing to actually watch it.
1594201927|1.0|The author is a professional historian. However, he seems to have decided it is more profitable to be a pundit. As others have remarked, the historical presentation is more anecdotal than comprehensive. Sadly, the author has elected to cherry pick his history to make his points rather than tailoring his notions to fit history.    Ferguson seems to think the Chicago school thinking on economics is, in some sense, definitive. One would expect a historian to actually look at the history of outcomes where Chicago school theories have been applied. Applications range across South America and to Russia, across the 1970s into the 1990s. One might reasonably expect, were the theories sound, all successes or at least mostly successes. Instead, the failure rate is 100%. Interestingly enough, Anna Schwartz spoke in public recently. (The Chicago school is, allegedly, founded on the Schwartz-Friedman tome \\"Monetary History of the United States.\\") She very circumspectly implied disagreement with the theories of that school other than the very narrow area of the book itself. It was almost if one were speaking with a constitutional conservative now sitting on the Supreme Court. Yes, at 93 she is still alive, well, working at the NBER and still sharp as a tack.    Then Ferguson misanalyzes  both the LTCM implosion and the sub-prime mortgage disaster. Evidently the author knows little about the Black-Scholes-Merton theory, its reliance on the Central Limit Theorem and the limitations of the CLT in the real world. The short version of that is, when you most need protections provided by the CLT is the precise time when the precursor conditions break down, making the CLT no longer applicable. Add ever shrinking profit per trade, resulting from other players analyzing the nature of what LTCM was doing, followed up by the desire to keep making very high rates of return which implied ever increasing leverage and you have the witches brew that was the LTCM situation before the Baht collapsed. The collapse of the Baht triggered a domino effect which meant the CLT no longer applied. Vastly excessive leverage meant LTCM had less than no chance to weather the storm. This critical truth is left out of the author's analysis.    In the banking and financial sector, certain key facts were also notable by their absence. Imagine writing an insurance policy in which the following are true: 1. you have no idea how often the event which will trigger payment will occur; 2. you have agreed to pay out 100% of the face value of this policy even if the losses are less than 1% (but greater than zero); 3. you decide to write such policies for more than the total net worth of your company. Can you say, \\"AIG?\\"     Bankers saw AIG make huge profits, so decided to sell their own wholly opaque, unregulated derivatives, CDOs, CDSs and all the rest. Were it not of such disastrous proportions, the situation might have been amusing in its irony. A bunch of supposedly prudent bankers engaged in trading instruments the value of which was intentionally made indeterminate and, arguably, indeterminable, to one another on a scale far beyond the national debt and the GDP combined.     The irony occurred when these same bankers then appeared before congress and claimed that rocket science was required to value said derivatives which they themselves had intentionally made to have uncertain value.     All this and much, much more was swept under the rug by Ferguson. I expected a far better book of considerably more accuracy and analytic care than this.
B00003TL18|5.0|The other night a buddy of mine called raving about a disc he had picked up a few days earlier.  I had seen Roy Orbison's \\"Black & White Night\\" disc in the rack at my local music store for many years but for some strange reason never paid much attention to it.  It turns out that was a huge mistake.  My friend was right.  \\"Black & White Night\\" is a real keeper!<br /><br />According to the liner notes, during his long and highly successful career Roy Orbison had never recorded  a \\"live\\"  album.  About a year before Roy's untimely death in December, 1988 a few of his \\"admirers\\"  gathered together to back Roy Orbison  in a memorable \\"live\\" performance.  This was no ordinary band.  The group included Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, T Bone Burnett, k.d. lang, J.D. Souther, Jackson Browne and Jennifer Warnes.  And let me be very clear about this.  This was not a case of a group of all-stars coming together to prop up an aging rocker who had little left in the tank.  Not at all.  For Roy Orbison sparkled that night as did just about  everyone who was involved in this project.  There is absolutely no doubt that \\"Black & White Night\\" was a labor of love for all of these perfomers.<br /><br />Included among the 17 tracks on \\"Black & White Night\\" is the very first tune that Roy Orbison ever wrote, something called  \\" Go, Go, Go (Down The Line)\\".  I had never heard that  one before and I enjoyed it immensely.  You will also get a chance to sample Roy's first big hit from his days at Sun Records.  The rockabilly song  \\"Ooby Dooby\\" was a huge hit for Roy in the summer of 1956 and the band seemed to have a grand time playing this one.  Of course Roy Orbison's \\"salad\\" days were his years at Monument Records in the early 1960's.  \\"Black & White Night\\" includes a dozen of those memorable hits including \\"Only The Lonely\\",  \\"Running Scared\\", \\"Uptown\\" and one of my personal favorites \\"It's Over\\" which was a huge hit in the spring of 1964.  Meanwhile, Roy certainly managed to erase any doubts about his vocal prowess with his stunning performance of  \\"Crying\\".  That one is sure to send chills up and down your spine.  Roy sounds every bit as good as he did when the song was first recorded more than a quarter century earlier.  \\"Black & White Night\\" closes with an extended version of the Orbison classic \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" where the musicians get a chance to show off as well.  Phenomenal!<br /><br />\\"Black & White Night\\" is a great disc that can be enjoyed by both long-time Orbison fans and by younger listeners looking to sample the work of a legendary artist.  For my money \\"Black & White Night\\" should be added to any list of \\"essential\\" recordings of American popular music.  Very highly recommended!inly managed to erase any doubts about his vocal prowess with his stunning performance of  \\"Crying\\".  That one is sure to send chills up and down your spine.

B0013FSL0C|2.0|I know, I know...critics love this series, and judging from the reviews, audiences do, too.  I don't.  My wife loves it, and this is how I have seen an assortment of episodes, and they have all struck me as about as interesting as listening to my neurotic friend whine about his \\"issues.\\"  I have very little patience for this sort of thing in real life; even less in my entertainment.      People have praised this as \\"incredibly real,\\" which perhaps is the problem I have with it.  There is not a narrative in each episode in any traditional sense.  There is story, yes, but no plot, and while I certainly don't need an ambitiously structured plot in stories, I do expect character-driven pieces to have interesting characters.  These characters behave like petulant children; these are not interesting neurotics.  And frankly, I find Byrne's \\"incredibly real\\" patience trying--I want him to leap up and start smacking them around and telling them to grow up!  They're that annoying!    I have always enjoyed Gabriel Byrne's work.  I wish I could give him a separate 5 star for this.
0395645662|5.0|I know this book doesn't need another rave review, but I have to say this is one of the best, most thought-provoking children's books I've ever read. It is only one of two books I've ordered in hardcover after reading it. I'm a children's book author and read a lot, and this is the first book for our book club that I have loved from cover to cover. The writing inspired me in so many ways, both as a reader and a writer. I can't wait to share this book with my granddaughter--and that's meeting a very high standard!!

1400079276|5.0|Now I know why this book is on the 1001 books to read before you die list. It is an amazing and vivid book that explores how one finds oneself when all is perceived lost.<br />In this book, a 15 year old boy who calls himself Kafka runs away from home, and perhaps through fate or destiny, finds himself at a privately owned library with its own secrets. He is running from something that it is very important he avoids, but no matter how far you run, can you really escape fate?<br />Meanwhile, an aging man who had an accident when he was young that left him a blank slate makes his own journey. Strange things have a habit of happening when he is around, but he is compelled to make his journey, although he doesn't know where it will take him and exactly why he has to make it.<br />These two stories interweave each other with rich descriptions, a bit of magical circumstance, and lots of music. Classical music is described throughout this book while the characters are learning more about themselves and their capabilities. It made me want to listen to Schubert's piano sonatas and Beethoven's Archduke trio very much.<br />This is my 3rd Murakami, and it didn't disappoint. It is very deep reading in places because so much of it is introspective, but I loved going on the journey with these characters. A wonderful read.
0307277887|3.0|I have to applaud Jeff Lindsay for creating such an excellent character.  There is a reason why a hit show has come out of this book.  His creation of the character Dexter is the best thing that came out of these novels.    However, each one seems to build painlessly slow with minimal plot development and it seems as though Mr. Lindsay got bored writing the book or realized he needed a paycheck and wraps everything up within the last 25 or so pages.    I give him kudos for original characters.  I'll probably still read the books, but I prefer Showtime's storytelling ability (and I NEVER say that).
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Season 8 was by far on of the best season's yet. Lots of action and the story of doomsday just make things more interesting.

The other customers that gave it 1 or 2 star are the ones that just dont like the show or they just started watching it. Smallville belongs in your collection
8170262259|5.0|Wow!  At 50 years old, I read it for the first time, and every page \\"blew my mind\\" with wisdom.  And, it made me swell up with tears as well!      \\"The Little Prince\\" insipired me to read \\"Wind, Sand and Stars\\", and it is amazing how many things are either conceptually, or even litterally, parallel in both books!  This \\"de Saint-Exupery\\" is an incredible writer!  And, he brings existential truths about life out of theory and into reality!    Don't miss them!  But, start with \\"The Little Prince\\" as it is a Miracle!     ADDENDUM  On January 9, 2010, I edited my origianal review to remove the references critical of the Katherine Woods translation.  I was parrotting what a friend of mine, and her friends and young son, told me.  It was not appropriate for me to write as if I were so sure of myself.  The Amazon.com review of this book does write of certain mis-translations in the Woods translation, which affect its intended French beautiful \\"flow.\\"  The Amazon.com review goes on to describe this Howard translation as an improvement as their review claims this Howard transalation is truer to the original French.  Many customer reviews, however, write with great passion, and provide detailed translation examples, supporting the view that the Katherine Woods translation was actually much more consistent with the poetry and flow of the original French.    I have never read the Katherine Woods translation although I remember my brother had it as a little kid.  I bought him a copy, and I am about to buy myself one.  That is how much I LOVE this book!  I am thrilled that the \\"Miracle\\" lives on, and I \\"have\\" to read it again; and, I get to compare the two translations and the surrounding controversy.  (I saw there is a discussion topic about the two translations, but I did not care to look at that.)

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|It's a little-known fact that none other than Lucille Ball is responsible for the birth of [[ASIN:B001DHXT6G Star Trek]]. As the titular head of Desilu Studios in the 1960's, she green-lit former LA cop Gene Roddenberry's idea of an intergalactic western and championed the series during its brief three-year run on NBC. It is amazing to consider how the franchise continues to thrive 43 years later, so much so that director J.J. Abrams ([[ASIN:B0019LY5IM Lost]]) and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have been able to re-imagine the legacy of the series without sacrificing the fidelity needed to satisfy the throngs of rabid fans who pushed the grosses north of the $200 million mark in its first week of release. As someone who is not remotely a Trekker, I have to admit the creators have done a fine job of reincarnating the familiar characters into their youthful counterparts and concocted an engaging, time-traversing plot that smartly avoids heavy exposition in favor of action and pyrotechnics. The result can be sometimes mind-numbing and trivial, but the 122-minute movie is never dull.<br /><br />The densely populated plot throws us forward to the year 2233 (or backwards depending on your perspective on \\"Star Trek\\" lore) as the USS Kelvin confronts a major alien vessel captained by an embittered Romulan named Nero. An alternate timeline is revealed, and inevitable tragedies ensue. Years later, we meet the familiar characters from the TV series culminating in the USS Enterprise's maiden voyage. James Kirk is a cocksure hothead with obvious Starfleet Academy potential, but he is haunted by the father he never knew. The half-human, half-Vulcan Spock is a brilliant student-turned-control freak by his nature but sometimes unable to reconcile the two sides of his identity. Their initially hostile relationship provides much of the film's spark, as they one-up each other in face a common enemy in Nero. This provides a good excuse for the CGI-enhanced action sequences with a plethora of explosions and characters zooming in and out of frame. By the time you start to feel the excess and redundancy in this approach, the story wraps the viewer up in its core ethos - that the Enterprise crew is an extended rainbow coalition of a family even as entire civilizations are destroyed.<br /><br />Abrams and crew are smart enough to recognize that the movie has to capture the heart of the original series in a way that doesn't patronize fans yet engage us non-Trekkers. Most of the casting choices are solid, although a couple of them are rather distracting. With the lightweight veneer of a tween idol, Chris Pine captures the braggadocio and roughhewn manner of a youthful Kirk in a way that tethers him to Shatner's real-life personality without doing an outright imitation of the elder actor. Even better is Zachary Quinto who has little latitude to vary Spock from fan expectation, yet he brings subtle but palpable currents of humanity to his stoic character. The rest of the crew is painted in broader strokes with Karl Urban coming closest to caricature as \\"Bones\\" McCoy; Anton Yelchin, laying on a thick, Cold War-era Russian accent as the extremely young Chekhov; and Simon Pegg ([[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz]]) pulling out all the comedy stops as exiled engineer Scotty. Somewhat more subtle are Zoë Saldana ([[ASIN:B0009RCPUW Guess Who]]) as linguist specialist Uhuru, who has a surprising relationship with Spock, and John Cho ([[ASIN:B0017ANAX6 Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay]]) showing that he can handle action sequences with dexterity as neophyte helmsman Sulu.<br /><br />Covered with latex, Eric Bana is hardly recognizable as Nero, although he makes the most of his character's stock vengeance motives. It's genuinely odd, however, to see Tyler Perry ([[ASIN:B001WAKOX0 Madea Goes to Jail]]) as the head of the Starfleet Academy and especially the still-doe-eyed Winona Ryder trying to look maternal as Spock's human-side mother. Among cinema's comic book franchises, this one is closer to [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]] than [[ASIN:B001GCUO1Q X-Men Origins: Wolverine]] on the quality scale. Visually, it doesn't disappoint with Daniel Mindel's dazzling, kinetic cinematography and Scott Chambliss' creative production design that mixes retro and futuristic elements seamlessly. At the same time, the convenient timeline jumble doesn't really give rise to any complex moral quandaries beyond the importance of building friendships and trusting your colleagues. Nonetheless, the movie is propulsive entertainment which doesn't tamper with its genesis and focuses squarely on the humanity of the familiar characters. For that accomplishment, we should all be grateful.ses, this one is closer to [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]] than [[ASIN:B001GCUO1Q X-Men Origins: Wolverine]] on the quality scale.

Riordan kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the book.  This is a great book for reluctant readers! I hope that Riordan brings new campers to Camp Half-Blood because I hate to see this idea completely end.
B00111L0MY|3.0|The plot of this movie is unique and entertaining. The BD PQ and compressed SQ were excellent quality. Casting was poor...Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan were not believable cast in those roles. Morgan Freeman lent a little star power to this movie, but it was not enough to save it from a mediocre overall performance. The Boston \\"accents\\" were a little phony and excessive at times.
B002ASVYWS|5.0|First and foremost, I've been as big of a Karnivool fan as I can be with my limitations of living in the United States. \\"Themata\\" was - and still is - absolute gold and I've been waiting for, \\"Sound Awake\\" with bated breath. The way I heard and felt, \\"Themata\\" is what I was initially looking for in, \\"Sound Awake.\\" When I picked up this album, the first thing I noticed is that it was far from, \\"Themata\\" and, if I'm being honest, I was a bit disappointed... but that didn't last long.<br /><br />Upon just the second listen and acceptance that this album is an evolution of the band, I absolutely love it. There are some elements on this album that will inevitably be compared to Tool, e.g. some of the percussive passages (the beginning of the song, \\"Deadman\\"), the bass tone on the higher registers with the usage of delay (0:56 in the song, \\"New Day\\"), and the overall groove of select passages throughout the album. This, however, is not a detriment, in my humble opinion and the instances are few and far between. Likewise, while the aforementioned may be a noted comparison between the two bands, the note choice, however, is not, and that's what really sets any comparisons apart.<br /><br />In all honesty, I think this album is all about Ian Kenny. Man, he really shines on this album. There is MUCH more vocal work on this album than on, \\"Themata.\\" He is as melodic as ever, but there are some really soaring and beautiful harmonies present throughout the album. One thing I love about his singing is that what he says is crystal-clear. As far as the lyrical content goes, there isn't much that's cryptic. He makes his political and religious views clear (which I absolutely agree with, so I'm REALLY connecting with what he's saying), as well as speaks to the human element by poetically positing questions and making lyrical observations of the facets of life we're all plagued with. With lyrics such as, \\"God's not where you hope, he's more than come and gone; it's time we all moved on,\\" \\"[t]here's something peculiar 'bout the way you pay to save your soul,\\" and, \\"I will not get back in my cell; I will not let a savior define my freedom,\\" he leaves little room for the listener's personal interpretation.<br /><br />Instrumentation-wise, \\"Sound Awake\\" is less heavier than, \\"Themata.\\" It's much more melodic and groove-laden. You can really tell this album was a collaborative effort between the boys, because there are times where it feels like you're right there in the studio with the them while they're jammin' on a groove and just feelin' it. Some people may not find this appealing, but being a musician myself, I absolutely love it. It's difficult to explain (it just kind of has to be heard), but, \\"Sound Awake\\" has these guys sounding like they're feeding off of each other and playing *together* in ways I rarely perceive on, \\"Themata.\\" The music makes you want to see this live, because there is so much on this album that would allow for the audience to really connect intimately instead of just rocking out (which there's nothing wrong with).<br /><br />If you're looking for instrumental virtuosity in the form of insane leads and riffs that are in and of themselves a form of a lead, you're not going to find it here. No, the virtuosity of this album is encompassed in the absolutely wonderful song writing. These guys have put together some REALLY great compositions for this album! I don't want to just give it all away with spoiler play-by-plays of each song, so here's a brief description of what you can expect:<br /><br />Simple Boy: This song has a very layered, progressive, yet straightforward feel. It's one of the more rockin' tunes on the album, overall.<br /><br />Goliath: Perhaps the heaviest groove on the album, make no mistake that this song is one you'll want to blast in your car with the windows down for all to hear!<br /><br />New Day: This is the first lengthy song on the album, clocking in at 8:20. It's incredibly melodic and builds into atremendous wall of melodic heaviness for its climax.<br /><br />Set Fire to the Hive: This is the album's single which you can hear all over the web. When I first heard this song, I didn't really dig it; admittedly, it took a few listens to really grab me completely (I always dug the chorus of the song, though). If you make the connection between the lyrical content and the music, you realize that the music really seems to follow the lyrical progression and is there to add emotional context to what Ian Kenny is saying.<br /><br />Umbra: The intro of this really brings the band, \\"A Perfect Circle\\" to mind, so fans of APC will probably really gravitate to this song initially. This is the next somewhat lengthy tune on the album, clocking in at 7:50. It follows a similar musical path as, \\"New Day\\" in terms of how it builds up.<br /><br />All I Know: One of my personal favorites on the album, the lyrical context is incredibly deep. Musically, it's very melodic and groove-laden. There are heavy passages in this song, but the song as a whole really shines.<br /><br />The Medicine Wears Off: Somewhat of an interlude, it's only 1:49 but somehow feels much longer than that in the context of listening to this album from beginning to end. It's very laid back and flows well. Also of note, it's not just an instrumental!<br /><br />The Caudal Lure: This song has a quirky polymetric beginning that may seem unsettling to some people, but I love it. Overall, this song is up there with the heaviest on the album. The end of it, I particularly love with its layered groove and emotionally-grabbing feel under Ian Kenny's faint repetition of, \\"[w]here's your God?\\"<br /><br />Illumine: It's constant distortion on the guitars for this song, so expect a full-out, rockin' tune.<br /><br />Deadman: The longest song on the album at 12:04, it's an epic song that just has to be heard. It goes through many shifts between laid-back groovin', heavy riffage, soaring melodies and harmonies... this song has it all.<br /><br />Change: The second-longest song on the album at 10:47, it's much heavier throughout but less epic than, \\"Deadman.\\" That being said, it's still a great song.<br /><br />All-in-all, as with, \\"Themata,\\" this album is going to have a very high replay value for me for years and years to come! So, if you're a fan of Karnivool, you probably already have this album... but, if not, what are you waiting for!? =) If you're expecting, \\"Themata,\\" give this album all of just 2 listens and you'll find yourself beyond your expectations and in the realization that this album is both equally as amazing and unique as, \\"Themata.\\"<br /><br />For those of you who have never heard Karnivool, you're in for a serious treat... especially if you're from the U.S., because these guys are everything you've ever come to love about any good hard rock band over here and THEN some. Hopefully, they'll blow up over here at some point, but I've got a bad feeling that the genius of Karnivool will perpetually go as unnoticed over here as has the genius of other Australian bands, i.e. Silverchair, Dead Letter Circus, and The Butterfly Effect.<br /><br />Regardless, get this album. You absolutely won't regret it!<br /><br />-StephenSet Fire to the Hive: This is the album's single which you can hear all over the web.

If you are ultra sensitive as so many are these days you might take offense. My wife is Chinese and she took no offense.     I didn't look for any hidden meaning or high moral. I just loved the story, the acting from all parties and the over all feel of the film. It has the solemn approach of Million Dollar Baby and allot of subtle humor as well as lines that cause you to burst out laughing.    We saw this in the movie theater and I picked my copy up today. Definitely worth owning and seeing again.

B001W63DX2|5.0|I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Maiden at the LA Forum in February '08, their first US stop on this tour and also the setting for the Number of the Beast live footage. I also saw them on the summer '08 US tour, in Phoenix. Although my copy of Flight 666 is in the mail right now, I, too, saw it on VH1 Classic over the weekend, and can say that it captures the intensity and sound of the live performances (as much as can be, that is), and all the backstage and tour footage and interviews add to the experience. If you're interested in an amazing band of professional, mature musicians, and how they've stuck to their guns for over 30 years, 14 studio albums, and numerous tours, buy this.    It's no wonder that they can still blow away bands less than half their age: they're obviously clear on what's most important, which is writing music about which they are passionate, and delivering it to fans as best they can; there's no puking, bloated old rock star behavior here. I thought it was funny to see Lars Ulrich, who is younger than these guys, chattering backstage at the LA show, looking like a tired old drunk...add to that Kerry King of Slayer, also at that show, who looks like he swallowed the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man...and contrast them both with Dave Murray and Nicko McBrain playing golf, or Adrian Smith fishing, while on tour -- and still bringing the house down every night. All of these points come through clearly in the documentary, through footage of the band on and off stage, and interviews with them and their road crew. Another outstanding documentary by Sam Dunn.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|This is one of my favourite series'. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that several of the dvds are defective. Episodes keep skipping so much that sometimes I can't even see more than a half or a third of an episode. I spent so much money on this and it feels like a con - like I bought bootleg or something.
0374139563|5.0|While this book has received quite a bit of criticism from the aid community, I find it incredibly refreshing.  To clarify, Moyo is talking about government to goverment aid, not emergency aid or NGOs working in different countries.  It's an important distinction to make.    I think one of the main points Moyo drives home is: why is no one asking where this money is going?  Governments need to be held accountable for their actions and for where aid money goes.  While there isn't a silver bullet, Moyo offers practical solutions about issuing debt on the international market and creating easier channels to trade within Africa, among other ideas.    I had the chance to see Moyo speak and meet her in person.  She is a very genuine person and has incredible ideas.  If only these ideas could be implemented....    Anyone who is interested in international affairs and development should read this book.  You should also read people who support Moyo's position (Bill Easterly, Paul Collier) and those that don't (Jeffrey Sachs).  Then make up your own mind on what you believe.

B0013FNC38|5.0|I highly recommend Jason Mraz's music.  It is easy listening with amazing lyrics. Sometimes I feel I understand his songs, and then I hear them again, and I have a new, deeper understanding of his message.  There are many times during my day, when I am struggling with...whatever... and his lyrics pop into my mind: Live High, Live Mighty, Live Righteously and celebrate the malleable reality, nothing is ever as it seems....  When I hear his music, I feel happy.  This music has helped open my eyes & my heart.

B002BPQ0Y2|1.0|This autotune infused Hip-POP needs to stop! At one point in time, Black Eyed Peas were one of Hip-Hops best groups. They infused live instrumentation with fresh beats and rhymes and were even compared to the legendary Roots! My how times have changed. Now we have this crap. Sure, it may be catchy for the club scene, but how is everyone NOT sick of the T-Pain rip-offs? Seriously! Move on, nothing new to see or hear on this pathetic piece of trash. Where is the innovation and artistry that Will.i.am was once known for? Whatever though, why does anybody care about good music when there is money to be made on bubble gum, microwave popcorny, wannabe pop sounds. Go ahead and get that paper BEP, while you still can cuz' when this style of music fades to black people will remember what groups and artists ruined the music industry. And executives wonder why the industry has gone to $#%^!?!?
B001B71NOI|1.0|While I did enjoy NIN's earlier material, his new stuff just doesn't do it for me. It isn't that I want to hear The Downward Spiral 5 times over. It is the simple fact that his music just isn't good anymore. I have enjoyed seeing them live a few times and they are still an excellent band as far as a live show is concerned. Trent has seemed to have lost that spark of angst and cynicism that made albums like The Fragile, and Broken so addictive and visceral.I may be being a bit too harsh but,I have listened to NIN since Pretty Hate Machine and I think as a long time fan I deserve to voice my own opinion. If you like music with heavy loud guitars and great choruses then go pick up the new CKY (Carver City). It is excellent.
0307269752|4.0|Will this novel hold a significant place in the annals of literary history? Not a chance. None the less, any mass market paperback fan of John Grisham thrillers would do themselves a favor to step it up at notch with, 'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\\". What Larsson lacks in plot development originality, which in this genre isn't easy to find, he more than makes up for in the freshness and detail of the novel's characters. Neither those who enjoy the non-traditional, tormented, strong feminist nor those who identify with an easily culpable, genuine, straight man will feel distanced by the perturbed ongoing of the heinous plot. Definitely worth a read.
0385340575|5.0|I enjoyed this as much as the rest of the books in the series and I would like to still be enjoying it, but (of course) one must reach the end page at some point.  Hopefully, there will be another chapter in the Jack Reacher story (maybe a movie? Stacy Keach would have been my choice a few years back - my apologies to Mr. Keach) or another similar character will come along.
1416550542|3.0|I won't waste time giving anyone the low down on the book since there are already so many of those. I will tell you that I am disappointed with the author's inability to ever make me care for any of the characters. I found their responses to most situations to be lacking real human responses. So many people are introduced that no one ever shines or is completely developed. The story ends up being okay, fairly predictable and not something that I would spend any time thinking about after having read it. I bought the book and will now be donating it to the library since I would not recommend it enough to pass it on to a friend.
0316017922|5.0|I found Outliers to be a highly enjoyable read. Its a book you read and find yourself telling others about. It debunks the convient myth that people we look at as successful or just born with it. That thinking lets some people feel comfortable with not being as successful as they could be. The bottomline is the book shows you why Bill Gates and a few other successful people are in effect successful. It was because of their life experiences, luck, and taking advantage of the opportunities given them. Also, you will find the year and time of year you are born can make a big difference; I am not talking about horoscope stuff eitehr, haha.
0786852550|5.0|I stumbled across \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" in February, and am surprised that I haven't heard of it before. This is the first book in the \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\", and so far I'm impressed. I particularly liked how Stroud used POV (Point of View).<br /><br />Typically, most authors pick a POV and stick to it (for good reason), however Stroud very successfully worked in a mix. There are basically two POVs, and he changes back and forth between them in each chapter. In the Bartimaeus chapters, Stroud uses first-person. In the Nathaniel ones, he uses third-person. At first this threw me off, but after a few chapters it became quite clear and quite cleaver.<br /><br />Story overview:<br />---------------<br />An eleven-year-old boy named Nathaniel-or at least that's his true name-forced to become an apprentice magician at a very young age, struggles in a love deprived home. He spends his days studying and memorizing the art of magic. Because his master is so mediocre, he wishes to keep Nathaniel below him, and so the boy hides the fact that he is years ahead of the game.<br /><br />One day, when challenged to a battle of wits by an arrogant wizard named Lovelace, Nathaniel quickly proves his knowledge of the art. Rather than showing recognition, Lovelace gets angry and makes a fool of Nathaniel by calling an imp to physically assault him. This begins a chain of events between Nathaniel and Lovelace, which only gets thicker and thicker as the story progresses.<br /><br />Ultimately, Nathaniel summons a djinni (pronounced jin-ee) named Bartimaeus to steal an object from Lovelace, only to find that the Amulet of Samarkand is going to be used as an object for the master wizard's dreaded plot. The boy and the djinni find themselves dependent on each other in order to bring down the evil wizard.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />-------------<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I would even go so far as to say that I loved it! Many of the arrogant comments that came from Bartimaeus forced a literal LOL out of me, and the characters are both wonderfully and dreadfully (in a good sense) designed. Great tensions between them all. I will absolutely read the next book in the series, and am looking forward to doing so soon.<br /><br />James D.

David McCullough's book upon which this movie was based is among the better books I have ever read.  In the end I don't believe any movie could have done it justice.

0786838655|4.0|This is a story that I saw on Amazon as a recommendation for people who liked Inkheart, so I figured I'd check it out.<br /><br />Written in the first person, there are a few places that are a bit off, but overall it is written quite well. The mix of mythological characters, inside the setting of the modern world, is an original concept as far as I know. At least, how it is done in this book.<br /><br />This is a great story for kids with ADHD and/or other learning disabilities. As having been one of \\"these kids\\" myself, I can appreciate Jackson's messages of encouragement.<br /><br />Story overview:<br />---------------<br />Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson, a kid struggling with ADHD and dyslexia, is constantly finding himself in trouble and getting kicked out of different schools. But one day, something amazing happens at the school he currently attends; he finds himself using a magical sword to protect himself against one of his teachers, who just so happens to be a Fury in disguise.<br /><br />This doesn't keep him from getting banned from, yet again, another school, and so he goes back home, accompanied by his friend Grover. Receiving a less than ideal greeting from his stepfather, Gabe, Percy is at least able to go on a camping trip with his beloved mother, Sally Jackson. But the trip goes bad and Percy finds himself trying to escape a minotaur, who destroys their car and injures Grover. And all though Percy ends up killing the beast, it was too late to prevent the mysterious death of his mother.<br /><br />Percy wakes up in a cabin, which is in a special camp for \\"Half Bloods.\\" He discovers that his father was a god, and, in order to stop a war between the gods, he ends up going on a quest in search of Zeus' master bolt, which was supposedly stolen by Hades. Accompanying him are: Grover, his goat-like friend, and Annabeth, the twelve-year-old half-blood daughter of Athena. With only words from an oracle's prophecy as his guide, Percy faces many adventures before reaching the new Olympus and seeing his father for the first time.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />-------------<br />At first, I wasn't sure about the story, but I kept with it. I was glad I did. By the end I was hooked. I will be reading the next one in the series in the coming months. Oh, and Ares as a biker? Nice touch!<br /><br />James D.

B001SO69IY|2.0|The orig blackout is one of my favorite albums ever.  It was fun and had energy.  What I enjoyed most was how Meth and Red worked together.  The intro was sick and then with songs like maaaaaaaaad crew, y.o.u, and cereal killer like you could listen with your friends and trade lines.  this album dont work that way.  seems like red leads into every song the beats are not even close to the first album and it lacks the teamwork between meth and red.  feels much more like hiphop then 2 friends making music I wish i wasnt disappointed but I had high hopes for this album.  too much red
055357342X|5.0|This was probably the most action packed, as well as tragic, of the first three books, where many breath-holding subplots finally get their resolve after over 3000 pages of series, where age old conflicts come to climax, elusive secrets finally get revealed, and the true character of many enigmatic figures comes to light.<br />  Here Martin succeeds in dashing virtually every hope of the armchair fan about two thirds of the way through the book, no matter who he or she had been rooting for, but at the same time proves his writing mastery by keeping the reader from throwing the book down in utter disgust with the sheer power of several intriguing subplots; subplots that readers may not have even realized that he or she even cared about until Martin so deftly and punctually turned up the flame.<br />  Alot has been written about analogies in this series to the War of the Roses, using the literary critique school called \\"Historical Criticism,\\" but in order to offer something new by way of review I would herein also like to put the book  under the scrutiny of what I'll call \\"Prehistoric Criticism.\\"<br />  In a nutshell, this series can also be equated to the Pleistocene Ice Age of Europe, where winters really did last for hundreds or even thousands of years. The giants and children of the forest could well be seen as Neanderthals and/or other archaic humans, or possibly even the earliest so-called Cro-Magnons, or Aurignacions.<br />  The First Men would be the tale end of the Aurignacion, or possibly the Gravettian, whereas the Andals represent later cultures such as the late Gravettian and Solutrean (despite the Andal's metallurgy) or even the far later \\"Iron Age.\\"<br />  The Wall could be seen as a memory of the great glaciers that once lay across Europe, and for millenia seperated \\"Upper Paleolithic\\" homo sapien from the neanderthals, and later seperated both the Aurignacions and neanderthals from the invading Gravettians for a time.<br />  If we are to look at the book as a memory of the real age of myth and legend, which some believe is the Pleistocene Ice Age, then The War of the Roses takes a back seat; since we have no details of the political history of Ice Age Europe, Martin had to create a probable one. And since history repeats itself, why not draw influence for the the sordid details of clan warfare from one of the ugliest snapshots of human pettiness and depravity we have available to us, The War of the Roses?<br />  Surely Martin shows us here that Houses and Banners are no more civilized than Clans and Totems, and that both caves and castles can house the barbary of man.<br />  And of course, Valyria can be equated to Atlantis and the Ironmen to the predecessors of the Vikings.<br />  Further, Martin seems to have used more than just the War of the Roses to bring political life to this mythical memory of the Ice Age; to name just one instance, Oldtown with it's cobblestone streets and bribes to the Andals reminds me much of my hometown of Savannah, also of cobblestone streets and huge manors, and it's similar bribe to Sherman...and being a decently well-off American Martin is sure to have heard the spiel of the tour guides from the Hostess City of the South on a vacation sometime in his life.real age of myth and legend, which some believe is the Pleistocene Ice Age, then The War of the Roses takes a back seat; since we have no details of the political history of Ice Age Europe, Martin had to create a probable one.

As an anthropologist, I was hoping for a scientific review of recent neurological and psychological advances in understanding the ways in which people come to believe things like religion or superstition or engage in behaviors that range from ritualistic habits of baseball players to OCD. Instead, Lipton seems to embrace irrational belief rather than explore it; adopting pseudoscience rather than science. His derision of evidence-based medicine in the introduction and first chapter are also disappointing. If you're looking for an actual exploration of the biology of belief, it probably isn't this text. On the other hand, if you're looking for confirmation of belief...
0064407667|3.0|Story overview:<br />---------------<br />Violet (fourteen-year-old girl,) Klaus (twelve-year-old boy), and Sunny (infant-girl,) are playing on a beach one day when a man walks up and tells them that their parents just died in a house fire.<br /><br />To add to their good news, they are forced to live with a man named Count Olaf, who is a distant relative (and happens to be an actor.) It becomes obvious that Olaf only wants the children in order to find a way to get at their parent's fortune. He treats them very poorly, giving them unrealistic chores, terrible sleeping arrangements, and even goes so far as to strike Klaus in the face. Making them call him father, Olaf himself refers to the children as orphans.<br /><br />One day Olaf shows an odd act of kindness, and talks the Baudelaire orphans into taking part of a play called \\"The Marvelous Marriage.\\" Klaus finds out that Olaf's plan is to use a real judge, give guardian consent, and have Violet say \\"I do.\\" The play is intended to be a real wedding, which would give Olaf access to the fortune that Violet is too young to access herself. Appalled, both children do what they can to prevent the tragedy while taking care to not let Olaf kill Sunny, who he had taken hostage.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />-------------<br />I liked the occasional explanation of words, as they are often provided with a twist. Such as, \\"... money is an incentive - the word `incentive' here means `an offered reward to persuade you to do something you don't want to do.'\\" The writing is easy to read, the book not very long, and the personality of the characters is enjoyable to follow.<br /><br />Things to consider:<br />------------------<br />This book is good for younger children, probably six and older, and for both girls and boys. There are no sexual references, or foul language to speak of, and violence is at a minimum, but the situations may be a little disturbing to some children. Such as Klaus being hit in the face and Sunny being hung out the window in a bird cage. All these things are used to show us how evil the count is.<br /><br />James D.

0375826726|3.0|After Eragon and Eldest comes the 3rd book in the Inheritance Cycle, Brisingr. Originally designed to be the final book in the series, Paolini decided to go a little further and plan on a fourth book.<br /><br />Named after the first word Eragon learns in the Ancient Language, which means \\"fire,\\" Brisingr becomes a significant part of Eragon's arsenal (I won't spoil it, you'll have to read to find out.)<br /><br />I question Paolini's decision to break into four novels. Why? Because Brisingr is very slow in places and sometimes seems to just drag on, particularly towards the middle. It could have easily been cut down by deleting a lot of the unnecessary political stuff-this was written for kids right? I can see them easily getting bored with those parts.<br /><br />Story overview:<br />---------------<br />As mentioned in my review of the last book, Roran's fianc&eacute;, Katrina, was captured. Brisingr starts out with Eragon and Roran infiltrating the Ra'zac's fortress. After rescuing her and killing every last creature, Eragon is faced with determining the fate of Katrina's father, who had who betrayed Carvahall.<br /><br />Arya eventually meets up with Eragon (who was separated from Saphira (his dragon)). They return to the Varden where he reunites with Saphira, attempts to restore the curse on Elva, and tries to locate a new sword. After fighting off Murtagh and his dragon, Thorn, the Varden learn that the enemy is using an army that does not feel pain-A trick of Galbatorix. After the wedding of Roran and Katrina, Nasuada (the Varden leader) sends Eragon off on a mission of diplomacy to assist in choosing a new dwarf king, who is hopefully sympathetic to the Varden's cause.<br /><br />Eragon then goes with Saphira to Ellesm&eacute;ra to extend his training from Oromis and Glaedr. He learns the fate of his father, obtains a new sword, and rushes out to meet up with the Varden-whom Roran has been fighting with all this time-as they lay siege to a city that is under the control of Galbatorix. A new Shade arises in his path while his master fights a distant battle, and in the end, those left standing prepare to march to Belatona and from there the next city until they come to the fortress of Galbatorix.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />-------------<br />Where I lost some appeal for the series between Eragon and Eldest, I lost a bit more between Eldest and Brisingr, but not enough to dissuade me from reading the fourth book when it comes out. I actually liked some of the slow political stuff, but as I said, it's probably not so appealing to a younger crowd. There were times when I felt like giving up, and the beginning took me some time before I got into the story, but I forced my way through the thick waters just long enough for it to take shape.

B001IBIQU6|4.0|DEPECHE MODE- Sounds of the Universe        After 2001's somnambulant EXCITER (a misnomer of a title if ever there was one), it was easy to dismiss Depeche Mode; they were old, out of fashion, and had peaked back in the early nineties. But '05's  PLAYING THE ANGEL went a long way toward silencing such talk, and was the band's strongest effort since SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION (not to discount ULTRA, which featured three or four classic songs).        SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE, then, picks up very much where ...ANGEL left off. Advance word was that the band were investing in lots of old analog synthesizers, and it shows. Musically, this album has more in common with the classic VIOLATOR than anything since.        Opening the disc in dramatic fashion, \\"In Chains\\" is the type of paean to S&M Martin Gore is so fond of writing (you know, sex as metaphor for...well...EVERYTHING, actually). From anyone else at their age, it might be creepy but David Gahan's sincere delivery pulls it off. In fact, Gahan sounds great all the way through, particularly on first single, \\"Wrong\\", where rapid fire vocals, strong lyrics and great melody meet to create what will no doubt be a live favorite.        The bulk of the writing still falls on Gore's shoulders, of course, but at least two of three Gahan contributions sound perfectly at home here. \\"Come Back\\" is a highlight, arriving on a bed of distorted synth (or is it guitar?) with a heartfelt vocal on top.        But it's Gore's \\"Peace\\" that's the standout track. It's a testament to this band that lyrics like \\"I'm a living act of holiness\\" and \\"I am walking love incarnate\\" somehow don't come off as trite when they're married to this kind of beautiful melody and classic synthpop.        Guitar is used sparingly throughout. It doesn't appear (obviously anyway) until the fourth song (\\"Fragile Tension\\") and rears it's head only occasionally thereafter, usually in a passive rhythm role.        Gore only sings lead on \\"Jezebel\\", a slow, prettyballad- exactly the kind of song he always seems to reserve for himself. It's not his best, but like so many Gore-sung tunes, it's probably destined to be a fan favorite.        It's not all great. The three songs between \\"Wrong\\" and \\"Peace\\" just kind of breeze by without making much of an impression, and Gahan's \\"Miles Away/ The Truth is\\" has a clunky rhythm track that detracts from a good melody and what is otherwise actually a decent song.         Overall then, it's not quite up to the high standard set by PLAYING THE ANGEL but it's definitely in the same ballpark. Depeche Mode have survived their synthpop heyday and been around so long that they are now something very unique. There simply aren't many (any?) other bands playing this kind of music anymore, let alone doing it this well.         They could go on like this for years. And here's hoping they do.

They go to the home of Professor Digory Kirke, who owns a huge country house and lives with his housekeeper, Mrs MacReady.<br /><br />Lucy discovers that a mysterious wardrobe is actually a portal to another world called Narnia. She meets a talking faun named Tumnus and learns of the White Witch, who made it always winter but never Christmas. No one believes Lucy on her return, but one day Edmund and her end up in Narnia after hiding in the wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek. Edmund is deceived by the White Witch and betrays his siblings once they all find their way to the world of Narnia.<br /><br />Meeting up with the Beaver family, the children learn about the fate of Tumnus and the goings on in Narnia. They find out about a prophecy and Aslan (The Great Lion), who is said to be on the move. They eventually meet up with him, and when Edmund is rescued, the White Witch demands his return. According to the ancient law (the \\"Deep magic\\") she has the right to do so, but instead of handing over Edmund, Aslan takes his place to die for the boy's guilt. This isn't the end of the Great Lion, as a final battle takes place and the prophecy is fulfilled.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />-------------<br />When I was little, my mother read me this story and I absolutely loved it. Unlike some of the other books my mother had read, I still like this one as much today as I did back then. Ironically, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is one of the books in this series I liked the least, but it still marks the beginning of a wonderful magical world, and a journey that every kid should experience. If you have never read them or have not let your children do so, then go out immediately and pickup a copy now!<br /><br />James D.

B001W63DXC|4.0|If you do not have any of the previous live Maiden releases then pick this up immediately.  The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is that most of the songs are on other double live offerings.<br /><br />All that said, this is a very good live Maiden effort, and they have touched upon most of the songs that they are known for.  The band still has the golden touch and they have an extremely energetic live show that should not be missed.  The next best thing is to own a live Maiden CD so you can have a small taste of what they have to offer on stage.<br /><br />The recording quality is very good, up there with the Rock in Rio release, and much cleaner than the Live After Death remaster.<br /><br />I am not going to review the songs, because they are the standards that Iron Maiden is known for.  All in all well worth the money.
1595141715|5.0|The most interesting part of 13 for me at first was the format. The book is written as a double dialogue narrative. I'm not even sure if that's the appropriate term, especially since I'd never read a book written using this style before. It's not a double narrative because it doesn't switch from character to character by chapter or even section, but it really is a dialogue - as if the characters are literally talking to each other. This concept is made more intriguing by the fact that one character is an omniscient narrator - fairly unreliable at that - and the other has a very limited point of view. Furthering the interest is the structure and chapter organization. In addition to the unique format of this novel, the story and concept are interesting, especially to those angsty teenagers we all love to hate (or is it hate to love?). The novel revolves around a girl who sends out audio cassette tapes to thirteen people who she feels contributed to her suicide. Although Asher is obviously not a teenage girl, he did a remarkable job entering the mind of one. The plot of this novel moved so quickly, I finished it in less than 24 hours. It's that good!    Recomendability - pretty decent - teens and readers of YAL, probably mostly girls, but the double dialogue narrative will pull in a lot of guys too!

0091922348|4.0|I bought this book as a gift for my wife. She's a former professional chef and caterer, and now a superb home cook. These recipes are sensational across the board. Especially notable are the chicken w/ sumac, za'atar & lemon, as well as the marinated turkey breast w/ cumin, etc. However, there is a challenge for us Americans because the measures are metric and the temps are in celcius. This book is published in England. Didn't the Brits invent our system of standard measure? Anyhow, it's worth the trouble for me to convert these recipes for her because these dishes are outstanding.
0596522347|4.0|Most of us are not trained graphic artists. We don't really know how to produce or deliver effective visual presentations. Nancy Duarte says professional communicators need to learn how to create visual stories that connect with our audience. She explains the 'why' of good design. For example, we presenters should realize that data slides are not really about the data. They are about the *meaning* of the data. That is, a slide's value is determined not by the amount of information it contains,  but by how clearly it communicates conclusions and insights.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Beethoven's piano sonatas were one of humanity's great achievements. They have been recorded in toto by numerous pianists including Artur Schnabel, Alfred Brendel, Richard Goode, and Claudio Arrau - and nearly every pianist of note has recorded at least a few of the most popular sonatas.<br /><br />What makes the Kempff set work best for me is the lack of a dogmatic, cookie-cutter approach to the music. Kempff approaches each piece as a masterwork in its own right. The tempos are more sensible than those adopted by many other pianists, particularly in the slower movements. For example, in the Hammerklavier Sonata, most pianists cannot resist the urge to play the Adagio almost as a Largo - ignoring the fact that such a tempo would have made the movement incomprehensible on a piano of Beethoven's time, which had a quick tonal decay.<br /><br />Speaking of tone, Kempff has an especially beautiful sound - a product of his training by the 19th century master Henrich Barth.  The phrasing is more flexible than today's \\"red light, green light\\" stop and go approach, and Kempff, unlike so many of today's pianists (notably Andras Schiff), never lets musical point making get in the way of the big picture, structually.<br /><br />Although Kempff was getting along in years when these recordings were made - the 1960s - he is fully up to the technical hurdles these sonatas contain. But Kempff was never one for heaven storming bravura, so those familiar with the \\"Appassionata\\" Sonata may be disappointed by Kempff's clear headed approach to the final movement. For that particular piece, I much prefer Richter's RCA recording.  As a counterweight, Kempff was especially in tune with Beethoven's humor, and Op. 2, No. 3, Op. 10, No. 2, and Op. 31, Nos. 1 & 3 are exceptionally on point here.<br /><br />Offered at bargain price, this is one of the best values in Beethoven's music available.
1416914307|5.0|I loved this series! I completely devoured these books in 2 days.     Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series has everything! Vampires, Demons, Warewolves, Warlocks, Faeries, Witches, Shadowhunters (sort of like Buffy with a backbone), separate worlds, magic, action, adventure, happiness, saddness, loss, plot twists and turns and most importantly (to me!) LOVE!!!     There are, of couse, some faults as I'm sure you'd find with any book. But for me, I couldn't possibly give this series anything but praise.     After reading all 3 books and sharing them with as many people as possible, I picked them up and read them again.

B001VPJZ1S|4.0|So much for the cliche that our central character has to be 'likeable'.  Hugh Grant's character (and would the movie get away with it were he not Hugh Grant?) is selfish, shallow and cynical.  But also funny.  Although he's a 'boy', he's balanced by the movie's second POV, a real but also troubled, eccentric, touching boy.  Each learns from the other and the script is excellent in keeping those two POVs in perfect balance, including Voice Over Narration from both that is among the most skilful use of Voice Over ever.  The climax departs from Nick Hornby's novel for understandable reasons - the original is too low key and too complicated - but in going after the usual Working Title movie big finish (private emotion in a public setting) opts for a huge contrivance in which a rush of emotion almost carries us past its unbelievability.  Until the last ten minutes, however, this is just about perfect.

0307454894|4.0|\\"The Reader\\" is an insightful story, written in a terse and sparing style. This tale excuses no one but brings forth the troubling issue the post war generation, in Germany, was forced to face; how to heal the nation and face the sins of their fathers. The story has at its heart the souls of two individuals, their entanglements, shame, and an aging love. No one seems to make the right decisions in this tale, which begs the question ; how do we judge rightly in these times when the circumstances of an earlier era were so different? The film, I felt was stronger than the book. The author, in my opinion, writes as if he's impatient with the deeper examinations that other writers of this era have issued themselves, but perhaps something is lost in translation.[[ASIN:0307454894 The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)]]

B001W79MB8|5.0|OK, the story line here is maybe just a B or B+ protection/revenge kind of thing. But I went with a 10-year-old Studio Ghibli fan, and we both ended up liking this a lot. It's simply really well done in the action and visuals department. I think it will be considered a lesser known classic.
074356619X|4.0|I checked out the 4 cd set from the library last week, just to see what this was all about. I've been listening to them on my morning jog, and as of this morning I am on the 3rd CD, and have been cheesily putting these positive visualizations to work for about 5 days. Several things have happened. Three I won't even mention, because there's too much backstory to make it interesting to a review skimmer, but they were significant and, in one case, just unheard of.      But the one I know people will be interested in is the little money miracle: We're looking to buy our first home, and are coming up short in the downpayment department, right? There's this house in a nicer part of town that really interests us, but it's a bit out of our reach. So last Friday morning, I kept visualizing $100,000 coming into my life, pretty much with each footfall of my jog.  About 3 hours later, the husband calls me at work and says, \\"guess what?\\"  Yep, he had just been idly talking to a relative about our househunting experience, and the (not rich! as far we knew) relative volunteered that he'd be willing to give us $100,000 toward that particular house. I had not even spoken to my husband about these CDs and my morning meditations, and this amount. So, you know. I'm just sayin'.
B001UREJWM|5.0|I consider this album a gift from the gods of Heavy Metal. The Dio Era Sabbath fans out there will be pleased by this material. I enjoy all the tracks on this release, after all this isn't some pop crap with a couple of singles and the rest mindless filler. This is SABBATH - Take it for all, in all. Everyone has a right to their opinion, except the meat puppet that won't be buying this album due to the cover art. Hey dude, talk it over with your invisible friend. I'm sure he'll give you a pass on this one if you pray extra hard.

0345409671|5.0|This is a fantastic read! This is Anne Rice's Best! Memnoch The Devil examines that you cannot always be sure. No matter how real your beliefs are; no matter how impressive your visions appear... You can still lose your faith in life and become challenged. Nobody has the BEST answer and nothing is for certain until the end. That it is personal and we can lose our grip on reality at times through our beliefs.  No matter what, The Bible and Mythology influenced much of what we know and enjoy today... It is only up to the reader how they relate to this book. Anne Rice's books tend to have many different connotations with Mythology and The Bible as do Vampires... Obviously. The book wasn't intended to preach a religion to us but for us to enjoy a good and unique read!   What especially makes it fun to read for me is that it is a Vampire with a fascinating history himself who meets a much more fascinating and powerful creature and finds himself learning about the foundations of life on earth from Memnoch The Archangel's perspective.    ALL IN ALL IT IS ENTERTAINMENT AND A GREAT WORK OF FICTION.    5 stars *****    You may also enjoy: The Vampire Lestat, Interview With The Vampire, Queen Of The Damned, Paradise Lost, Dante's Inferno.

B0028N729O|5.0|Camille, young cub reporter from Chicago is sent to her small hometown in the bootheal of Missouri to investigate the murder of one little girl and the disappearance of another.  Typical plot, but the author doesn't give us the typical characters with the typical happy ending.  Far from it.<br /><br />This is a dark and disturbing story with no holes barred and not for the faint of heart.  All of the characters are messed up in one way or another, and this may be the most dysfunctional family saga I've ever read.  I'm not even sure why I liked it and read it in one day, but I did but I'm not sure I could recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />Nice to see a new author tackle difficult problems, thus the 5 stars.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|The most glaring thing about this is that I want 2 mention is the enterprise; which is suppose to look more primitive for (a prequel), looks super high tech.  So are we (smart trek fans) suppose to buy this???????  So did somebody from the future go back in time to pre-TOS time period; give the starfleet future ship designs, use it for a little while and then as Kirk became older revert back to earlier ship designs?? This enterprise looks just like the Enterprise A.  Terminator 3 (in that series) makes better sense than when compared 2 this.

075640407X|5.0|I completely loved this book.  I have read many books by various authors in this genre: Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, and Raymond Feist just to name a few.  I don't even have the words to complement Rothfuss's writing style.  I was entranced after the first chapter.  I found the story itself to be very original including the various forms of magic in existence.      I did read a few of the negative reviews, and I completely disagree in regards to comments made regarding unnecessary chapters or too lengthy portions.  I believe that everything included in the book was absolutely necessary in order for us to form an attachment to Kvothe's character.  To feel for him.  The fact that he was poor did consume the majority of his waking thoughts.  That is the reality of poverty, and I found it in no way redundant.  I think it was absolutely necessary in order for us to become attached to the character and really see things through his eyes.    I couldn't put this book down.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a love for fantasy and originality. This book left me wanting nothing more than to start the second installment.

I loved this movie - it was so beautifully lensed and smartly written!
B001FOR5XU|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet for all the quick broswers out there. This is very different from the film version released with Will Smith in the lead role. While some ideas were carried over to the film, the story is superior in almost every way. I Am Legend was a good film with some great acting from Will and his furry companion, but the book is much darker and has less of a \\"Hollywood\\" ending. One large fact about the book, that wasn't obvious to me before I purchased it, half of the book is actually I Am Legend. The rest is a collection of short stories that are a nice surprise, as they give you a break from the loneliness of the first half of the book. Great book and it will not dissappoint fans of horror/suspense and fans of post-apocalyptic settings.

B00192IV0O|3.0|After a considerable length of time since the hit-filled \\"Monkey Business\\" stormed the charts in mid-2005 The Black Eyed Peas are back with their ambitious new record \\"The E.N.D.\\"<br /><br />Smash lead single \\"Boom Boom Pow,\\" which has spent nine weeks and counting atop the Billboard Hot 100, is surprisingly the group's first single to reach #1. And why shouldn't it be? It aims for something fresh and original and succeeds. Interesting verses intertwine with the chorus in restrained but relentlessly hooky, choppy melodic fashion. Fergie and will.i.am sound like they are having the time of their lives. The latter's production skills just short of wizard-like.<br /><br />There are many more hits here, including \\"Rock That Body,\\" which will grab the attention of DJs and club-goers worldwide, and the gorgeous, rollicking \\"Meet Me Halfway,\\" an upbeat ballad where Fergie digs desperately with emotion with the tenacity of a soap opera queen. \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" is an easy, breezy summer hit in the making with Fergie's evocative vocal leading the way. The lyrics and melody are surprisingly simplistic, but in this case less is more.<br /><br />This stuff is highly individual yet also retro-friendly with 80's-inspired synths and loose, spaced-out vocal effects, with auto-tune spread like butter, lathered perhaps too earnestly over the proceedings. The majority of the tracks live up to the album's full title - \\"The Energy Never Ends\\" - although some like \\"Party All the Time\\" and \\"Showdown\\" fail to live up to the standard set by some that appear earlier. \\"Imma Be\\" and \\"Missing You\\" fall short with limp melodies and lack solid hooks, but other filler tracks such as the chorus-deprived \\"Alive\\" are still listenable.<br /><br />\\"Electric City\\" is an intriguing if unmelodic experiment in snazzy, tech-savvy wordplay (\\"Hit `em with the sound/Shoot `em with the bass\\") and \\"Now Generation\\" both criticizes and celebrates the knee-jerk lack of patience that characterizes the information generation. will.i.am name-drops Google, Wikipedia and Facebook as Fergie yells \\"I want it now!\\" \\"One Tribe\\" is a colorful track with a fluid, downbeat, international vibe as will.i.am waxes on the strength of diversity but calls for unity, not division. The track is a fine listen and escapes sounding like a preachy PSA.<br /><br />Not everything works on \\"The E.N.D.\\" On the second half of the record the melodies tend to grow weaker and the sound effects louder. Still, it has some seriously solid tracks and will continue to spawn hits for a long while. There is a limit to its success, but this is nevertheless the sound of a band anxious to forge new ground. Other groups may be phoning it in lately, but not The Black Eyed Peas.ogle, Wikipedia and Facebook as Fergie yells \\"I want it now!\\" \\"One Tribe\\" is a colorful track with a fluid, downbeat, international vibe as will.i.am waxes on the strength of diversity but calls for unity, not division.

0930289234|4.0|Yes, yes, wonderful, wonderful. It is a great character sketch with the standard Alan Moore complete disregard for normal time keeping. Really good.<br /><br />But the ending. The ending is unforgivable. I have worked this through I have no idea how many times and I do not think it possible to generate a worse ending. Those infinite number of monkeys and their typewriters and time are incapable of creating something this bad. Horrifyingly bad. Bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />Yet, on the whole, still good. Hmm.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|I still do not understand why critics savaged reviews for this movie.  I have found it to be so compelling on many different levels.  Meryl Streep plays a nun in the middle private school that is stern where even a local priest calls her a \\"dragon\\".  She is a school principal dedicated to discipline, tradition and propriety.  School priest in the other hand is likable, he is popular with students and seemingly easy going.  However, the mutual dislike between him and the principal leads them both to a different level of intellectual battlefield.<br /><br />Nun is concerned about priest's close relationship with one of the school students that also happens ot be black.  Her suspicions are confirmed in one of the most stunning moments in the film when nun meets boys mother (shinning star actress Viola Davis).  The revelation between the two women about the boy's present state and his future is the soul of the movie.  Both nun and mother wish the best for the school and the young man, but what shall be the price of securing his destiny and the well being of the students of the school?<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\" is about crisis of faith, of individual's choosing to do the right things and any decent person's making moral transgressions for the greater good. People's actions and outside demeanor is not always a reflection of the purity of their soul.  At the end, we learn that everyone has a price to pay for their actions and their internal struggles. Wonderful movie, great performances.
B000AM2L1O|4.0|I gave this doll to our granddaughter who is only 13 months old, hoping her mother would put it away for a few months as I know this is too soon, but we have a great distance between us and don't see each other very often.  Even at her young age, however, she was attracted to it, picked it up and kissed it!  I am happy that the plastic is not of the harmful kind.  My only concern is that the eyes with their lashes are very attractive to this baby and she seemed to want to pull at them.

Stephen King's #1 book - \\"The Stand\\".  Stephen King's #2 book - \\"It\\".    \\"It\\" is the type of book that uses the power of memory and things from your childhood days as a basis for this book.  Put it this way...

B001MEJY8W|1.0|You've read the reviews.  By now, you've probably seen the movie.  \\"Martyrs\\" is France's latest gorefest.  Last year, they gave us \\"Inside;\\" before that it was \\"Frontier(s)\\" and \\"Haute Tension.\\"  This movie has caused a little more fervor because if you read most of the reviews (which are surprisingly good), you may mistakeningly lead yourself to believe this movie might make some kind of statement.  You'd be terribly wrong.<br /><br />First of all, I'm confused by the title.  I thought a martyr was a person who WILLINGLY suffers death rather than renounce his/her beliefs.  This movie would have you believe that there's an organization who are intent on making martyrs out of people so--if they live--they can tell them all about the \\"other side.\\"  Right off the bat I'm conflicted because NONE of these women did anything willingly.  They were all kidnapped and had all manners of unspeakable horrors done to them; their beliefs had nothing to do with anything.  If that's your cup of tea, (the gratuitous torture) then you'll probably need a towel to watch this movie...  But, I digress.<br /><br />I decided to start the movie with the director Pascal Laugier's introduction.  I knew immediately I was in store for something bad.  Any director who will tell you to feel free to hate him for his movie certainly won't have done you any favors while he made it.  The movie starts with the escape of a 10-year old from some sort of warehouse.  This became confusing, too, because the police are shown in the movie of going into this same warehouse, yet its occupants managed to go \\"undetected\\" for years and continue with their tortures.  Makes perfect sense to me.  What happens in the first 15 minutes of the movie is tame compared to the last 85.  Let's just say it appears that violence against women in cinema has made another comback.  Oh, the director tries (very lamely) to add a \\"twist\\" to the ending, but all that did was have me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Was I shocked?  No.  Was I nauseated?  No.  Was I scared?  Hell no.  Do I hate Pascal Laugier?  No.  This movie is just another staggering look at what \\"horror\\" means to most people now.  They don't want horror; they want blood, torture, and degredation--and LOTS of it.  I'll close by paraphrasing from William Shakespeare:  \\"This movie was made by a silly man, full of sound and fury, and signifying absolutely nothing.\\"scared?  Hell no.  Do I hate Pascal Laugier?

B001W79MBI|5.0|I was given this movie to watch and I must say, I was quite pleased with everything about this movie.  The hand drawn art work was beautifully done as well as the fleshed out characters.      It's some times hard to find good anime with a good story line that isn't just a bunch of random fight scenes thrown in to try and keep it interesting - this one had a story.  The development between the two main characters follows along perfectly with the story.  You can see each character come into their own.    The movie it self, very well done.  I watched the Japanese version and the being I'm a animae snob and only watch them with subtitles, this one was done just right.  The text didn't fly from the screen as soon as it was said and gave the viewer enough to read what was happening and watch what else was happening.    I'll purchase the one coming out this month and hope that it's the same style editing and subtitle style.
B0019M06JS|4.0|Good CD. She is a very good singer and piano player. The mix of jazz and bossa nova gives a special taste to her music.
B001AACEP8|5.0|This album is better than I expected.  I got it thinking it would have one or two songs I liked, but the entire album is really well done, with catchy lyrics and melodies.  It has excellent production and musicianship.    What impressed me the most was how many of these songs Katy Perry actually wrote herself.  Not only is she a great performer, she is a great writer also!!    Can't wait to hear more from Katy Perry.
B001WCBPCW|5.0|This CD is a big improvement on their last release[empire].The band is influenced by classic British bands from the 60's like The Stones,The Kinks & The Who. Their is also some more modern electronic influences but it's not overbearing.If you liked the first album then I strongly recommend this one.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I found this DVD to be completely amazing. Not only the actual movie which was shot on a minimalist budget, and yet was still more entertaining that Hollywood has produced in years, but the incredible special features. Even for those who have already downloaded it on iTunes or watched it on Hulu, the musical Commentary! alone makes this DVD worth buying and watching over and over and over.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Basically the item came at the last possible moment. Also the item I got was supposed to be a widescreen dvd. That is what the case even said when we got it. ... It ended up being a full screen dvd, which was not what we wanted, but its not worth shipping to return it!
B001TODCII|3.0|Taken is basically a more intelligent version of any Steven Segal or Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.  It is basically senseless action, but without 99% of the [...] that makes a Van Damme film so horrible, and regretable.  Those types of movies have their use, so I don't mean to disrespect them too much.  Sometimes you want just a reckless revenge tale, without the cerebral stimulation, or good dialogue...or believeable situations.    I want to point out that in the opening scenes of the movie --home video of the daughter opening gifts on her birthday-- the film's score plays two lines of music that sounds like a note-for-note rip off of Clint Mansell's score to The Fountain.  I don't know if Nathaniel Mechaly (Taken's composer) did this as an ode to Mansell or not, but it was so strikingly similar I paused the movie and brought up the final track on The Fountain's soundtrack: Together We Will Live Forever (the melody that appears about 51 seconds in) just to make sure.   I rewound and played the film's version again, then played The Fountain track. Identical. Taken's version is even in the same key!!    So while the themes, plot points, motivations, and even the score of Taken are not original or unique, they take what a lot of horribly executed movies (Segal and Van Damme) try to do and Taken one-ups them.   The exception is the score of course.  The Fountain's score is a hard act to follow.
0780624890|4.0|The movie is great and was brand new, bu when i first got it and took the plastic stickers off the dvd the some of the paint was removed from the dvd case, on the whole right side black to white. shipping was fast though
B000XG5J0M|5.0|The book was great, a real page-turner. However, several of the discs were damaged so I had to finish the book on the Internet.
0385340575|3.0|My husband and I are so very disappointed in Gone Tomorrow.  We have not finished it but we are not that anxious too either.  This story moves so much slower and does not have the action the others did.  Usually we can hardly wait for the next book release, but after this I'm not so sure.  Not recommended.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I know some fans will not appreciate my less than stellar review of The Dark Knight. so let me hasten to add...    I'm a HUGE fan of The Batman, with boxes upon boxes of old comics in the closet, and a hard-cover, collector's-item edition of Frank Miller's work on the shelf to prove it.    Given that, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed with The Dark Knight.    Disappointed is a relative term. It's still a great movie. And those associated with it and the previous Batman Begins have breathed new life into a franchise that Tim Burton, et. al., ruined (who could forget the Bat suits with the nipples?)    My problem with The Dark Knight is several-fold, notably that we just don't get enough background to help us understand some key elements.    Caution: Spoilers!    How does the Batcave become an underground warehouse? Why is The Joker  covered in smeared make-up? (Yes, we learn his father mutilated him. But that doesn't explain the make-up.) The idea that Harvey Dent ends up with half a face because toxic chemicals spill on him is nowhere near as graphic, or true to the Bat mythos, as having acid thrown into his face in a courtroom. The death of Rachel Dawes seems unnecessary... on the other hand, Gyllenhall is so unattractive in this role, as compared to Katie Holmes, that maybe it makes sense to kill her off. (Holmes probably regrets her decision to turn down the sequel just to work with a couple of big-name actresses on another movie.)    The Batman's fights look way too staged, not as furious, probably due to the changes in camera work that seem to slow the action down instead of speed it up. A difference from Batman Begins that doesn't work.    The movie is, finally, way too long.    If this current franchise continues, and I hope it does, here's also hoping that the creative team will introduce us to a truly mysterious, sexy, complicated Catwoman, put the emphasis on relationships, and continue the examination of the nature of good and evil.    Bottom line: Buy Batman Begins. Hold off on The Dark Knight unless you are truly a fan or a collector.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I initially bought it for the first two singles, but I must say that as I played it a few times during my commute, it grew on me. Nearly every track is enjoyable (especially loud, BTW), and of course \\"Pokerface\\" has now become my favorite dance-pop song (if only for that first 10 seconds alone). To paraphrase Stellan Skaarsgard's (sp?) comments about the work of Dan Brown...Lady Gaga's \\"the Fame\\" is the equivalant of junk food, its not very nutritious, and before you know it you've gone back for handful after handful until you've gotten a stomach ache.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Just finished what they call the \\"season of secrets\\" and while there was the same intensity and excitement of the previous series, it was nice to see DiNozzo out of his comfort zone with a love interest, Jenny pushing to the limits about a truth from the past that may or may not exist, and Zeva finding still where she belongs in the niche of the gang.  With McGee writing a novel on the side epitomizing the NCIS staff, Palmer fraternizing with a co-worker and Abby revealing that she is open to pursues of life no matter how small, even Gibbs seems to falters a little in doing something outside of his zone, romantically.
0439023483|5.0|This is pretty much the template to follow if you are going to do thought provoking work without slipping into morose adult BS.A serious page turner that leaves you begging for a sequel without being desperate about wanting one by the end. Everyone was excited about this book before it came out in the publishing world. EVERYONE.      A screwed up world, with heartfelt (not sappy) characters who feel palpable with enough stuff in there to keep teens in touch with their own inner lives. It's Lord of the Flies meets Thunder Dome , meets the Ms. USA pageant meets a cringe inducing reality show.Awesome.
B002BPQ0Y2|1.0|The first track is pretty good  BUT it is not censored and it blares out many curse words.  I was listening to the samples, debating whether to buy it or not, when out comes the s-word.  This was in front of an 8-year old and an 11-year old.    If you don't mind curse words, go ahead, but I strongly advise to not buy it and show amazon that you have to say \\"censored\\" or not.    I hope you  find this review helpful.  :)
0143038419|4.0|I picked up some time ago that it's considered cool to dis this book as shallow or something, and I tried to figure out what was wrong with my reaction, but I loved it and I don't think anyone who knows me would call me shallow. I enjoyed reading the negative reviews here, I really did, because it's interesting to see how someone else thinks; hence my enjoyment of the book. I'm kind of puzzled by those who didn't like the author's voice; that to me was what made it work. OK, the premise is interesting, too: eat your way through Italy -- a life goal of mine--, pray your way through India (I dropped out of an ashram there after less than one week) and fall in love in Bali, knowing you have a book contract to pay for it all. I'm as jealous as the next reader, but I really enjoyed the ride. I didn't love or agree with everything Gilbert did, but her snappy writing was very real, direct, personal and enjoyable to me. I'm puzzled by the criticism that she was too self-centered; who did you think she would focus a memoir about a journey of self-discovery on, you? As to poverty and suffering... I can't believe Ms. Gilbert wouldn't have noticed that around her, but that's not the only thing to notice in Italy, India and Indonesia, and for whatever reason she didn't dwell on it but I don't think she whitewashed things either; it wasn't like reading tourist brochures. It's been a couple of months since I read the book so I don't remember much in detail but that it was enjoyable. This is a book with a point of view, the author's very personal experience going through tough times but trying to take some sort of action while she looks inward and refocuses her life. I could relate to much of it and I enjoyed every word. I didn't understand the obsession with god, though I have a vague memory of having been that way as a child and teenager, but I grew out of it. &lt;g> It was still interesting to read about someone else's inner experience. Joyous writing from an author not afraid to laugh at herself. I didn't want to put it down and I didn't want it to end.augh at herself. I didn't want to put it down and I didn't want it to end.
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|It sure took a long time for this remastered Dylan record but it was worth it.  Anyone who likes this record will not be upset.  There are some \\"in the studio\\" photographs inside.  Nice touch.  Buy it now.
B000O89UG8|5.0|This is an extremely good book by a best selling author.  The book itself was purchased in Used-Very Good condition and arrived in that condition.  It showed very little wear.  I can only believe that it had been read only once, possibly twice at the most.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase and the books condition.  The story is exciting and gripping to the very end and, as always, Mr. Baldacci throws a few surprising twists in at the very end. I would recommend this book for any avid mystery/suspense reader 17 to one hundred years old.
B001W63DX2|5.0|I am in no way associated with Iron Maiden, DVD retailers, or any of the like. I am a lifelong Iron Maiden fan going back to 1982, and I wanted to share my take on the new DVD release.     = \\"Flight 666: The Film,\\" came out today, June 9th, and it is worth every penny of its purchase price. For anyone who saw Iron Maiden on The Somewhere Back in Time Tour, or has seen Maiden at any time in the past, I don't have to tell you how good of a show they put on, we all know, already. I wanted to just add my two cents about this DVD release, for anyone who was thinking about buying it, because not only is it an official Maiden release, it is also one hell of a bargain for what you get.  = Whether you get the \\"standard\\" issue, or the \\"deluxe\\" issue (only difference is the packaging, and you get an expanded booklet in the deluxe version) you get two discs. Disc 1 is \\"Flight 666 The Movie,\\" and Disc 2 is the concert footage from the film in its entirety, city to city.   = All footage from both discs is shot in high def, so everything looks great, I can't imagine what this looks like on the BLU-RAY format, must be mindblowing. The sound mix is excellent, and each disc caters to various sound systems no matter how simple or how high end they are. Sound formats include Dolby Digital 2.0, Dolby Digital 5.1, NTSC-PCM, and DTS. Personally I always like DTS, so I was pretty excited.  = As far as being a good bargain..... It is. I purchased this at Best Buy. They only had the \\"deluxe\\" edition which was listed at $16.99, but it's on sale for $11.99 !!!! It's less expensive than most audio cd's.  = As far as the content is concerned, well that is left up to the viewer. I thought the movie itself was pretty entertaining, a good mix of live footage, and documentary footage. The live concert disc is excellent because they go song to song, city to city, and you get to check out different Maiden fans, and venues from all over the world.  = As usual Iron Maiden delivers the goods with a classand integrity that most bands have never had, or lost a long time ago (ie. see Lars Ulrich in movie footage). Overall this is a quality DVD release, at a very fair price. It seems like Iron Maiden is always a step ahead of the game.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Advent Children is masterfully crafted fan service. Although it won't make much sense to those who didn't trek through the great Final Fantasy 7, it will bring tears to the eyes of those that did! Fantastic story, visuals and sound, now even better on Blu-Ray.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|This is what metal shoul sound like! great attitude and musical skill; totally brutal, yet artistic; the lyrics are great also. One of the best 2009 releases.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|First I'm happy to report that even on my old Sony BDP-300, load times are very reasonable. 2 minutes to load opening menus + 1.5 minutes to start movie for a total of 3.5 minutes! Not too bad at all. I was a bit concerned after reading some alarming reviews quoting up to 20 minute wait times.<br /><br />I will point out that I have the latest firmware (released 1/09) installed for this model via Sony's great support website. All that is required with any company's blu-ray firmware is to download the file and burn it to CD-R as instructed.<br /><br />After loading the disc in the tray, I pressed nothing.  Just let it load without pressing anything.  The message about a blu-ray profile 1.x player with no internet connection comes up for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the picture quality, it is DEFINITELY MUCH CLEARER AND SHARPER than the original blu-ray release! I'm a picky videophile viewing on a 46\\" Sony flat LCD.  If I thought the picture was sub par I would say as much.  There is a slightly soft look which undoubtedly helps hide film stock grain. The picture is so detailed that even the slightest differences is camera focus are immediately obvious. The original 2006 release was HORRID!  I couldn't believe it was called a blu-ray movie.  In fact my upscaled T-2 DVD looked pretty much the same or better.  It was hammered with bad reviews. Now I see that the original blu-ray and its reviews on not even listed on Amazon.<br /><br />THIS 'SKYNET' VERSION IS CLEARLY SUPERIOR!  It's also loaded with extras which the original blu-ray was not.
B001NB4Z6K|5.0|Let me first be absolutely clear--I'm not a fan of 'Best of's for the true fan of an artist of band.  Let me be absolutely clear about something else--I've never been a U2 fan.  I don't turn them off when they're on the radio, but in over 25 years of buying music, I never felt compelled to purchase one of their records.    Until now.    This collection is perfect for what I call 'the Radio Fan.'  This is a person not concerned with the genesis of a project, or of how an album fits together, or of hearing the chronological progression of a band's sound.  It's simply U2's best known tracks from the 80s, presented, seemingly, in order of popularity rather than chronologically or with an eye to an overall aesthetic for the album.  It's a 15-song sampling of the group during those years, and for those of us who never really cared about them beyond what we heard on the radio or saw on MTV (oh, for the days when they played videos!), this collection is just about perfect.    Highlights include...well, just about the whole thing, since it's a \\"Best of,\\" but my personal favorites are \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday,\\" and Pride (In the Name of Love).\\"  Both songs are infectious with that distinctive U2 chime and Bono's just-short-of-a-breakdown histrionic vocals.  Good, catchy stuff.    There's absolutely nothing here for the true fan of U2--no B-sides, no alternate takes, no remixes, no demos.  Just those radio songs that people like me remember fondly.    So, for the true fan who owns all the albums and sets--0 stars.    For the Radio Fans of the band--5 stars.    Recommended for nostalgic children of the 80s.
B00192IV0O|5.0|The E.N.D. has a very different sound from their last album and their songs are mostly different. This is a disappointment from Monkey Business. There are only a few songs that would remind you of the old Black Eyed Peas albums. After listening to it a couple of times, the songs are all very good.    Boom Boom Pow - It is now overplayed, the beat is very basic, but its a good tune - 7/10    Rock That Body - Probably the worst song on the album, that high pitched voice that keeps saying \\"Rock the Body\\" is so annoying, I would definitely avoid that songs. 4/10    Meet Me Halfway - Has an '80's feeling to it. Fergie gets the chorus and does a very good job with it. 8/10    Imma Be - Reminds you of the old Black Eyed Peas music, you start out slow and turns out fast. Very capturing beat, very good song. 8.5/10    I Gotta Feeling - One of the best songs on the album, very good beat, very well done song. This is officially their next hit of this album. You should really check this song out. 10/10    Alive - Slow throughout the whole song, but its still good. Sort of sounds like old stuff but not really. It sounds the same throughout the whole song. To slow and annoying at the undetermined chorus. 7/10    Missing You - Another '80's sounding tune, simple beat and Fergie takes the lead again. She really belts it out in this tune and she does very well. 8/10    Ring-a-Ling - I don't know why, but this is one of my favorite on the album. Just a very capturing beat mixed with the words and chorus may be annoying to some people, but I think its really good. 10/10    Party All The Time - Same beat throughout the whole song, but still a very good song with a mid-high tempo. Gets boring after the first 2 minutes of the same thing. 7/10    Out Of My Head - Fergie's sex song just like my [...] and shut up, not as good as the other ones but has a good beat. Kinda cheesy but good. 8.5/10    Electric City - Really good song and captivating beat, I like the chorus on this. One of my favorites. 9.5/10    Showdown - Interesting song, keeps a steady beat. Sounds almost like every other song. Nothing really special to this, but still good. 8/10    Now Generation - Starts out slow like a groove and goes into very basic beat. Now, there is some very pitchy singing in this. Fergie is way off on most of these notes, it is almost unbearable. 7/10    One Tribe - Get together song. Indian beat to it with the bongos in the back. The one song that everyone can dance to and it has a good beat. 8/10    Rockin To the Beat - Mostly music and the electric background saying \\"rockin to the beat\\", they only are involved very little in the song, which was very dissapointing. Good beat though. 6/10    Simple Little Melody - Definitely not the same as the title very captivating and very different throughout the whole song. Well done. 9/10    It takes a few listens to make a distinction between the songs, but when you listen to it a couple of times. You can tell that it is a really good album. Thanks for reading. I have edited this review so I would have given it 3 stars.
0446402397|4.0|This book has been out for a while, and my review will probably go unseen, so I'm going to keep it short and sweet:<br /><br />Engrossing, terrifying, addictive - great read.<br /><br />Like many, however, I wasn't crazy about the ending.  Things were wrapped up, but not very neatly; questions were left unanswered (the reason behind the method of the murders, for one), and some of the reasoning and solutions seemed convenient rather than plausible.<br /><br />Despite that, it was still a great read.  I'd recommend it to any mystery fan.

0762434279|5.0|This is an outstanding book, I highly recommend to anyone.  Feel free to read through all the negative reviews... but please remember, this is an ATTITUDE book, not a TECHNIQUES book.  This is an amazing book to open the average employee's eyes to a genuinely wealthy way of thinking.  Success is a thought-process, not a technique.  I see people left & right referencing \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" as why Kiyosaki's advice is inaccurate...I wonder if these people really read & understood \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\".  \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\", in general, is NOT about wealthy people, it's about the average person with a net worth over $1M...and that's generally someone who's worked their whole life in the S (Self-Employed) quadrant and been smart with their money so that they have created a comfortable lifestyle for retirement.  \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" teaches about working in the B and I quadrants (Business System owner and Investor, respectively) in which it's possible to create cashflows that are capable of replacing the need for traditional employment or traditional self-employment...essentially \\"retirement\\".  Many of the people who criticize this book are looking for get-rich-quick schemes, but if you are willing to accept that success in any of the quadrants (employees, self-employed, business system owners, or investors) is spelled H-A-R-D W-O-R-K, then the book can either be a great life changing first step or just a great eye-opener into some of the ways the genuinely wealthy achieve their lifestyles.  Great read, I hope you enjoy it!
0545128285|3.0|So the tales of Beedle the Bard is a cute collection of tales that preach morals of all sorts. The stories are fun to thumb through and pretty straight forward, although I found Rowling's and 'Dumbeldore's' commentary to be tedious to barrel through and quite unnecessary.<br /><br />This isn't really its tagged price, maybe like $5 on online because all you're paying for is an hour of reading and Rowling's rendition of morals and tales we've all heard of before, with a Potter-ish twist of course.
B000EU1PKK|5.0|Helloween is a great German Power Metal band. And this CD is a great CD with their first recordings.
B002BPQ0Y2|2.0|I am so tired of every group latching on to the vocader to process their vocals. I mean it's ok to use it to enhance a few words for the effect, but when every single song is dominated by auto-tune something has to give. From Lil wayne, to Akon and T-Pain, then Kanye's new record. Now the BEP have jumped on the bandwagon, and not a single track is missing this played out sickening auto-tune effect. Come on people, can't musicians actually SING anymore?
B001E5FYS8|4.0|As a film student with a concentration in documentary studies the new emergence of documentaries as a force in the mass market is something incredible to see! Man on Wire is an incredible example of how thrilling documentaries can be-- this is not only an educational film but a wildly thrilling one! The incredible footage that the filmmakers were able to get their hands on and the revealing interviews that accompany said footage spin a wonderful and enjoyable tale that documentary enthusiasts and mass audiences alike can enjoy! If you enjoyed this film please continue to look further into the genre of documentary! Don't stop here! Afghan Star, another festival buzz-heavy documentary, follows the thrilling journey of four finalists on the \\"American Idol\\" of Afghanistan (didn't know about that, did you?). Or you can catch \\"Troube the Water\\"-- the Academy Award nominated documentary that will show you the wrath of Hurricane Katrina in a whole new way. Man on Wire is a great start to the world of documentary, but don't stop here!
B001SMC91M|4.0|A very enjoyable album, listening to the various tracks you can hear the blues influence, although the tracks are more rock and soul than blues in my opinion. Joe Lewis gives a nod of thanks to James Brown on the inside cover of the CD case and justifiably so, a casual listener could easily mistake several of the tracks for James Brown.<br /><br />I am particularly taken by tracks 1-6 and 9, Humpin' for the most part is instrumental and Please Pt. Two did nothing for me (except make me think of Sam Kinison). The other miner complaint is the limited nature of only 10 tracks (I've become used to 12-15+ since CDs don't have quite the same capacity issues that vinyl did).<br /><br />My bottom line is that I found the CD very enjoyable and many of the songs will make their way into my playlists. P-)
B000FC0O7M|5.0|The acknowledgements chapter mentions photographs. But the Kindle edition omits them. (This is common for Kindle editions; the original Kindle was designed for text, not photos.)    The book is still a great insight into Mission Control, well worth reading in whatever edition you prefer.
B000BHHCXU|5.0|I've always wondered why Grapes of Wrath got the Pulitzer Prize and more general acclaim, because East of Eden moved me more. Sure, they both bear many trademarks of great literature--timeless themes, universal characters yet detailed descriptions, intellectually challenging yet emotionally resonant, and so forth--but really, is the story of a family that migrates any grander than the story of a family that mostly stays in the same place?<br /><br />To summarize this tome is beyond my skill, and I believe its relevance is so widespread that I'll only point out a few types of readers for whom East of Eden would NOT apply: anyone who's always gotten along perfectly with their parents and siblings; anyone who's always had perfect romantic relationships; anyone who's always understood perfectly what they want to do with their lives. But unless you fit those criteria, buy it, and buy it now.
B000071K5L|5.0|This great novel is full of lessons. Perhaps it is this that makes To Kill a Mockingbird a revered and beloved classic in the eyes of millions. Or perhaps it is Harper Lee's narration in the voice of a Southern child that makes it so moving. Or perhaps it is the story's timeless ability to draw forth sympathy from its readers as much today as it did in 1960. In a great twist, Lee examines the racist South through the eyes of a young white girl.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we are introduced to Scout and Jem, sister and brother living in a small, depression-era Alabama town. We follow their everyday life as they grow up and we learn the same lessons they learn. The climax finally comes when their father, Atticus, decides to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, falsely accused of raping a white woman. After news of this spreads around town, the children get a glimpse of the ugliness of racism. They learn from the example set by their father, forgiving even Mrs. Dubose, who was one of the most racism women in town.<br /><br />Being told from the perspective of a innocent Southern gal only makes To Kill a Mockingbird and its message more endearing. Lee's portrayal of Scout and Jem's firsthand experience with prejudice is powerful and moving. It makes me wonder: if so innocent and unknowing of a child such as Scout, can realize that racism is wrong, that an innocent man should not be punished, then why can't the adults? This nagging thought is probably what makes this novel so touching.<br /><br />Lee's writing makes it easy to picture the small Alabama town. Despite its many faults, there are many things and places about the town that makes it easy to love. Especially when people like the Finch's give the town an inkling of hope.<br /><br />What really captured me about this novel is its incredible ability to teach its readers life lessons. Through Jem's bout with Mrs. Dubose, Lee teaches us to always forgive other for their faults and look instead for the good in them. Through Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, Lee teaches us about the injustice of the world and subtly encourages us to take a stance against it.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird will leave you breathless. It touches upon so many different values and lessons in life and unfolds in a narration that enhances the impact of the novel's message. Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill a Mockingbird most definitely merits a second and even a third read. It is a timeless piece that never fails to impress.
1933771690|5.0|Lanza follows up implications in the quantum enigma of consciousness debate with some compelling ideas of the \\"Of course. Why didn't I think of that?\\" variety. The critically fine margins for conditions favoring life in the universe are their own argument for the creative role of consciousness in bringing form and substance to what is otherwise wave function potential. Lanza has an impressive scientific background, but his book is highly accessible to the average reader, generally free of impenetrable scientific jargon and made relevant to the common world of feelings and sentiment. His quotes from Emerson and Thoreau to illustrate points of biocentric theory are revelatory and startling in their aptness in explaining aspects of current quantum thought. I found Biocentrism to be a rich and hopeful book permeated with the consoling perception of an intimately personal universe that is not \\"out there\\" and to be feared, but within ourselves and tailored to our needs.

0345479092|4.0|This book was a godsend for me, a first-time mom who was at the end of her rope with our 8-week old baby. I had always prided myself on being able to handle just about any challenge in stride. As cute as she was at times - my baby was simply kicking my butt. I was losing every battle and starting to lose confidence in myself and my ability to deal with things.<br /><br />Finally, one day - while searching for answers to why my baby was breastfeeding every 30 minutes to an hour - I came across a link to Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. After just a few excerpts I realized how much I had been missing of what my baby had been trying to tell me. I bought the book - read it (over a screaming baby) in an afternoon - and started putting the strategies to work. THEY WORKED ALMOST INSTANTLY.<br />- My baby started going 2-3 hours between feedings!<br />- She started taking naps during the day... at least 45 minutes long<br />- She was happier when awake<br />- I was able to leave the house again<br />- I was able to shower, make lunch, just sit and watch TV again!<br />- My husband and I were able to enjoy each other's company<br />- I stopped being confused about \\"what was wrong\\"<br />- I finally felt confident that we could leave our little one with someone else and have a night out!<br />- My husband and I spent a lot less time frustrated and exhausted<br />- We started truly loving being parents - because we finally felt effective!<br /><br />In short - this book saved my sanity. I do NOT agree with the view of some reviewers that this book is biased towards formula feeding - quite the opposite. It has helped me understand how to breastfeed more effectively and give my daughter more of what she needs from a feeding. I also do not agree that this is just 'one step better' than crying it out. My daughter was crying CONSIDERABLY MORE before I started using these techniques. We can now quiet and calm her relatively quickly because we know EXACTLY what she needs.<br /><br />I will agree that this is probably not the approach for those that want to do attachment parenting... and the author says as much... but then again, if that was working well for you, you probably wouldn't be looking into this book. Or, if you have other kids and are comfortable with how you raised them, this might seem a silly method to try now.<br /><br />Despite what some reviewers have said (which makes me wonder how carefully they read) this book DOES NOT advocate \\"schedules\\" that need a time associated with everything. Instead, I think of it as \\"cycles\\" that my daughter goes through during the day. She does one EASY cycle, then she does another, and another, and another. Some are longer than others; some of the elements within each cycle vary from one instance to the next; but the pattern is always the same - and THAT has eliminated all of the guesswork and made it possible for us not to be slaves to crying, screaming, and fussiness.<br /><br />FYI - This is the method that Supernanny, Jo Frost, is a big proponent of. I, for one, LOVE Supernanny so her recommendation was as good as gold for me.hat want to do attachment parenting... and the author says as much... but then again, if that was working well for you, you probably wouldn't be looking into this book.

140550255X|5.0|With fifty years of memory on my brain's hard-drive, I can't actually remember when I first came across this volume. To say this book has left an indelible mark on my heart would be an understatement; it has had a profound effect on my life.<br /><br />This book is `the perfect storm' for me.  I have a couple paperbacks, a copy of the play script, an audio book, and the film.  I love the era, the book love (not just reading but being around books, the library, haunting old book shops - talking about books and just being with the books) and also letter writing to friends.  I have a couple of pen pals - my favourite is my friend Edel in Ireland (oh, how I long to jump on a plane and surprise her). I love most English things and NYC too (the theatre, museums...).  Like Helene, my heart skips a beat as I approach my mailbox and see a package waiting for me. For me this book evokes a time and a place - a simpler way of life.<br /><br />She was a near-do-well. Her book \\"Underfoot in Show Business\\" details her career. She only \\"just\\" made enough to get by.  She wrote plays that were never produced. She wrote for \\"live\\" television, but when the studios learned how to \\"film\\" television everyone moved to Hollywood. Helene wrote educational books - biographies for children. This book, \\"84, Charing Cross Road,\\" the play and film, her subsequent books and \\"Letter from New York\\" (her BBC radio broadcasts), kept her solvent, but never made her rich.<br /><br />I found a hardbound edition at Powell's (in Portland, OR) that I would run into a burning house to save.<br />In \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" Holly talks about 'the mean reds' - when she and the world are at odds and everything just seems wrong (which is different from 'the blues') and how she goes to Tiffany's...\\"84, Charing Cross Road\\" is where I go.<br /><br />RE: the audio book: I've read the book several times (+ other books by Ms. Hanff): I adore the film - one of my all-time favorites.  So, why did I even need to purchase this?  Well, I'm always looking for short books like this one to take on trips (and such).  This one, is just a little slice of heaven.  I've been in love with Juliette Stevenson ever since \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply,\\" and on through \\"Being Julia\\" and \\"Bend it Like Beckham.\\"  Her performance here is all you would expect.  I laughed and I cried all over again.  I can not recommend this one enough.  Buy it - NOW.this?  Well, I'm always looking for short books like this one to take on trips (and such).

B001I1123O|5.0|I purchased the hard copy of this book a while back and loved it so much and decided to get it in paperback.  First off, if you believe in a (any) God(s) and will not alter your views no matter what evidence is shown to you. You'll probably not enjoy this book. However, if you have an open mind and you are not afraid of a bit of criticism of your belief (or any belief system) then you should enjoy this book very much. Most of us (including myself) never bothered to question what our parents taught us. This book helped me realize what I felt deep inside.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I haven't had a chance to watch any of the special features, but the Blu-ray quality is really good.  Of course I had them on VHS before this.
068484267X|5.0|In this book none of the characters have quoted dialogue. I thought this would make the story boring, maybe a little dry. I was wrong. Mr. McCourt's tragic tale is compelling and heartbreaking. He never gives up, through it all he keeps on going.     It's a good story and an interesting look into history.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Fantastic!   For someone who grew up in the 1970's, during Trek's heyday, this is wonderful!  I've seen all of these so many times....and it's like seeing it all new again. This is an excellent vision of the original ground-breaker, and brings on a warm and welcome set of memories of a better time. I feel like a kid again watching these, and the remaster simply hightens the illusion. It always brings a smile to my face, and warms my heart. I know that those who have gone from us like De Kelley and Jimmy Doohan should be proud to have been associated with this. I can remember when Star Trek is ALL there was to watch, no Doctor Who, no Battlestar Galactica...(before Star Wars, everything else was crap when I was a kid) and this is the ultimate prize for the faithful. Trek is finally receiving it's due. The new effects work is icing on the cake, and NO Star Trek fan should be without this collection! This is a fine presentation of Classic Star Trek. The new effects edit is beyond words. This is fandom cranked to the max.   I am an industry professional now, a concept designer, having worked as an artist on the likes of BABYLON 5, STARSHIP TROOPERS, and now the new BLAKE'S 7, and I speak to you on the level of a lifelong fan: buy this!   I'll keep this short and sweet: if you remember and love the ORIGINAL CLASSIC, this is a true necessity for your collection. Don't delay, Buy This now! You won't regret it.  Hailing frequencies open......

Sigourney Weaver shows her great comedy timing, Alan Rickman takes a wonderful turn as a frustrated Shakespearean actor, and Tim Allen is at his best in this lighthearted spoof on the SF television programs of the past.    If there's a single fannish bone in your body, you will enjoy this film.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I have been a fan of the Black Eyed Peas since Fergie joined with the release of Elephunk but I only listened to their popular hits on the radio. I decided to get this album and listen all the way through and WOW!!!! This was SOOOO much better than I thought it was going to be; I was expecting just jam hits back to back (similar to Boom Boom Pow) but instead we got songs with actual depth to them. However, the album is not filled with just slow-moving songs. The collaborator of this album did a very well job distributing the songs out. You get a nice mix of slow songs, jam songs, and songs that are bound to be hit singles. What I'm saying is: BUY THIS NOW!!!! This album is PHENOMENAL!!!   These are my favorite songs (in order of appearance):   1. Boom Boom Pow  2. Rock That Body  3. Meet Me Halfway  4. I Gotta Feeling  5. Alive  6. Missing You  7. Party All the Time  8. Showdown  9. Now Generation  By making this list, I'm not saying all the other songs are bad, they are really good!! I'm just saying I like these the best.  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!!

B001TI9N7I|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.  It sat in my home for two weeks before I picked it up and started reading.  Once I did that, there was no turning back.<br /><br />It is a long book and an intricate story with a lot of characters.  It is to the author's credit that I was able to keep everyone straight with little trouble.  One other author that I know that has the ability to do this consistently is Stephen King.  Myriad characters; no confusion in the reader's mind.  And no confusion in the novel keeping the numerous 'facts' straight.  There was one minor error I saw concerning a birth date.  Beyond that, the editing was as good as the author.<br /><br />This is not the only thing that King and Larrson have in common.  There is also the ability to make what should be a long-winded novel totally captivating.  Every paragraph had a purpose.<br /><br />Like most people reading thrillers and mysteries, I work hard to figure out the clues before the ending.  I am pretty good at it too.  Mr. Larsson managed to do what \\"Primal Fear\\" once did.  The villain was a surprise.  The villain's backstory was a surprise.  There was one element I guessed but to state it here would be a spoiler.  And frankly I think that that one element was skilfully executed misdirection by the author keeping the real core mystery hidden from the reader.  Clever.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who has an appreciation for a well-written novel with the ability to get the grey cells ticking over.  I am about to begin The Girl Who Played With Fire.  I expect the same satisfaction.
0439680093|5.0|Meet Matt, he's an orphan who gets into trouble and through a government program he's sent to a remote town.  He's not enrolled in school, he's forced to work the farm every day, and he's decided to run away.  However, when he tries every road leads back to where he started.  He hears whispering in the wood and soon learns the town is populated with witches.  Only after making friends with a local journalist does he learn what his role is in resurrecting the Old Ones at Raven's Gate.<br /><br />This is a very good dark fantasy book mixing black magic with technology.  I look forward to the next book.  It's good for teens and adults.
B000002AS3|5.0|Amid all of the technotronic and electronica sounds that coveted the airwaves and were apparent with many bands that came out during the 1990s that fell within the so-called British Manchester Sound, a record comes out that shows that guitars and a good backbeat as well as the tambourine was still relevant in songs.  Oasis' 1994 debut, Definitely Maybe, spawned two mesmerizing and anthem-like hit singles, \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Supersonic,\\" that emulated a Beatlesque quality.  However, founder and songwriter of the band, Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals) and brother Liam (vocals) and fellow cohorts, Paul Arthurs (rhythm guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums), produced a record with Mark Coyle that embraced the musical influence of the Fab Four along with their own distinct sound.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Rock `n' Roll Star\\" says it all to what direction the band would take with this album and subsequent releases.  All the songs have that rock and roll and psychedelia attitude from \\"Shakermaker\\" to the concluding track, \\"Married With Children.\\"  But the highlight of the album is indeed \\"Live Forever.\\"<br /><br />With echoes of The Beatles chanting throughout the record, Oasis does a fine job at not completely mimicking their sound.  This is a record that fans of Oasis may want to add to their collection if they have not already.

1881273156|5.0|This is a very insightful and helpful book.  It breaks relationships down into easy to understand topics.  There are five languages of love.  It lets you know where you went wrong or right.  It shows how two individuals can think they're doing everything right but in reality they may be doing everything wrong.  I think it can heal a bad marriage or give insight into how a bad marriage went wrong.  It is easy reading and has a test in the back to help you discover what your love language is.  Hooray!
0525951113|5.0|Daemon is part 1 of a series. I do not know if there will be more than one sequel but the next book, \\"Freedom\\", is coming in 2010.<br /><br />It is important that the reader knows that this is a series because the book ends with most of the characters in a lurch and I was unsure if it was the 'real' ending or just a massive cliffhanger. After looking at the book's official site I can assure you that there is a sequel coming.<br /><br />Anyway, as has probably been explained many times in other reviews, a computer program created by a mad genius has infiltrated the world's computers and is creating a 'new world order'. A revolution is in the mix and it will be led by the world's disaffected and misfits - the tattooed computer geeks, the pierced gamers, crazed psychopaths that treat all life like it a NPC in a computer game, etc.<br /><br />There have been plenty of books, movies and TV shows about the computer that has taken over a building or a spaceship, such as [[ASIN:0451452739 2001: A Space Odyssey]] but this is the first one I've heard of in which the entire world economic system has been hijacked. I'm no computer expert, but and I am competent at most things concerning computers and the thing is, Daniel Suarez makes it seem so possible...<br /><br />Lots of techno stuff, tons of action, lots of death and destruction. The book is a rolling rampage and I'm going to be looking for the sequel.
141690977X|1.0|Okay,to sum up this book in a sentence I would say that it is \\"The Rules\\" repackaged in a hipper format for a younger generation. That is,the goal of these books is to simply find a man who responds (and even loves)mind games and enjoys jumping like a dog through hoops rather than one who values you as a person and geniunely wants to get to know you (rather than the manipulative tart who keeps putting obstacles in his way and keeping him at arm's length).   The main problem this books present is the lack of female empowerment in the intial contact (basically, as a woman,you have to just sit there and pray that the one guy in the place in whom you have interest comes up to you while having to deal with those you have no interest the whole night.You can do nothing besides accepting dates or denying them;never approaching your man of interest.This is an incredibly weak position) and the philosophy that shy guys either do not exist,are simply not into you,or just lazy sckmucks.Nothing could be further from the truth.There is also the very 1950's belief spread in these books that any man who accepts a date from a woman is simply going to view her as an easy lay and not relationship material.Okay, let me be blunt,yes,there are men like that out there.My nephew and his friends who have barely evolved to the state of standing upright certainly espouse this view.They also are the kind of guys who try to get the highest number of girls into bed and brag about all of the degrading things they can get them to do.Are these the kind of guys you want to date? Greg and Liz do a great job at teaching you how to land a player,but really,do you want to be the last stop(hopefully) on a whirl wind tour of chicks? The type of guy who has to be manipulated and tricked into marriage (a la \\"The Rules\\")is exactly the type of guy who will leave you with three kids after he's tired of feeling trapped.Not every guy is the marrying type,and most of the \\"smooth\\" men,the kind who have no problem starting a conversation wih any girl and who enjoy a pursuit the most are exactly the kind who will refer to you as \\"the ball and chain\\" and look forward to every bachelor party they can get invited to, and refer to their own wedding as the \\"march of death\\".  Here's a clue ladies:nice guys may finish last in the dating game,they're not flashy and won't write a power ballad about you that makes the international charts,but they make the best husbands and fathers for your children.I have been married for ten years now,never cheated,and was asked out by my beloved.Yes,I am actually shy and the thought of asking women out literally made me ill.If you want to write me off as lazy or lame then so be it,but after years (sometimes decades) of misery I'm the type you will be looking for.Bottomline:if you're interested,ask the guy out.The worst that can happen is that he's not interested and you now know that rather than wondering about what might had been.And who knows?He might be a shy guy who is extremely interested in you as well and is now flattered and relieved that the relationship ball has begun rolling.And what if he's a jerk who was refuses to date women who ask him out?Be happy you managed not to get into a relationship with such a Neanderthal.
0385736002|3.0|I have to respond to the reviewer who compared this series to HP.  There is none.  Rowling's series is much better written and much more sophisticated.  While the beginning of the Magician was fairly good, the quality was not maintained.  The pace was frenetic without offering depth of characters or plotting.  I felt very unsatisfied reading this series.  I am a librarian and a huge HP fan.  While Rowling isn't perfect, I feel she offers the reader much more in all facets of a novel.  If you're pining for more HP, forget it!
0920236162|1.0|I was excited to read this book and based on the reviews as a \\"feminist\\" children's story I bought it without reading it first. I think the story is weird ... why must the heroine either conform to princess norms or face life alone? No prince (or princess for that matter) out there who could love this spunky girl in a paper bag? I won't read this one to my daughter.
B0002KPIKA|5.0|Simply first-rate. Gens sung and looked the title part with elan. The supporting cast were of high quality. Scenery was elegant but simple and the costuming excellent. Stage direction added well to the overall performance. I think I detected 2 cuts from the complete score, which is OK, many conductors would have omitted more. The French have a good feel for Handel, and I look forward to more productions from them.
0763619612|5.0|My daughter (2 1/2) adores this book and has enjoyed it for months already. It is also one of my favorites. I just love the message of creativity. For mom's who are looking for books about girls that do not involve princesses or pink, this is a terrific book. We also love Ish. My daughter talks about Vashti and Ramon while other kids at daycare are talking about Ariel and Jasmine. I LOVE it! We also own an orginal print of Vashti painting that hangs in my daughter's room. We are big fans and can't wait for the next book.
B00186JBT6|5.0|For those who enjoy early music, particularly baroque, this set of fifteen discs should be self-recommending. A fair range of styles and composers is presented here. At the price, this would be a good place to start investigating the baroque repertoire for those who are tempted to do so but don't want to shell out too much money. Those with an aversion to the sound of the harpsichord should perhaps look elsewhere. The performances are well-recorded and engaging. Recommended.
B001EAWME2|4.0|There is a reason why Black Christmas has lasted so long.  It predates Halloween and Friday the 13th by several years as it is an early inspiration for the later rise of  \\"slasher\\" films.  It uses innovative camera tricks and gives us the killer's POV.  And it takes the sacred holiday of Christmas and interjects it with real-life morality conflicts of its characters.<br /><br />The transfer on this edition is decent, and is coupled with some great features.  A 20-minute candid interview with Margot Kidder stands out.  Also, a documentary featuring remembrances from the cast and crew is quite informative.  Top it off with a new 5.1 mix, and you have a nice blu-ray bundle.  Great to add to your collection!
B001WCBPCW|5.0|This is the third album from a band I believe to be criminally underrated and largely unnoticed here in the United States. The store I went to only had 3 copies of the album...ON THE FIRST DAY OF RELEASE! Anyways this cd is a huge improvement over their second album. The strength of the songs here are incredible. Standouts include Underdog, Fast Fuse, Thick As Thieves, and...well pretty much the whole album. If you like wonderfully crafted pop rock with electronica and a hint of psychedlia thrown in then you're going to love this cd.
B000P0J09M|5.0|This movie is just a classic for my generation. If you're in your thirties, you know what I'm talkin about!  DeNiro is just a classic actor and never fails to impress and Ray Liotta was a fresh face with promise! This movie actually made Ray Liotta's career take off.  Joe Pesci was just perfect as \\"Tommy\\"! Scorsese should've gotten the Oscar for this movie instead of \\"The Departed!!!\\" The plot is intriguing and the movie keeps you on your feet as you experience what it's like to live thru the eyes of \\"Henry\\" and feel like a real life mob guy.  This is just an excellent movie and a must have!!
0385736002|5.0|Nicholas Flamel was originally introduced to me in Harry Potter.  I now have found him in many books and was curious on how this one would play out(and some of the other characters here also). I loved this book and am continuing to read the series.  This is not your ordinary use of mythological beasts, gods, people, and fictional folks.  It is a well written rollercoaster ride that you don't want to get off.
B00192IV0O|5.0|This review is short and simple. The Black Eyed Peas are back with their most amazing cd!! Some songs are just fun with no deep lyrics and some others are deep and accompanied by some slammin beats!! All in all the cd is a must have!!  This is perfect for motivating yourself to clean your house and also as a soundtrack to your elliptical machine workout!!  Buy it now!
B001EN71DG|4.0|The Star Wars Trilogy DVD set is a fairly cheap, very effective compilation of the Original Trilogy films. If you're looking to simply own the films so that you can watch them (both Remastered and Theatrical Versions) at will, then this is a great set to buy. However, the set lacks any really good special features or bonuses, other than some interesting commentaries on all the films and a Lego Star Wars II demo. It all really depends on what you want to own.
B0000797IO|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A successful but ultimately rather forgettable independent film which wisely dials down the \\"quirky\\" factor in order to focus on characters rather than contrived situations, The Good Girl is a decent movie, nothing more: watch it if you like the actors in it.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I don't know how they come up with this stuff, seriously! I have been wondering for the first 3 seasons how come Heaven doesn't lend a hand in the fight, then along comes the angels for season 4. Castiel appears to be a truly good angel, but some of his higher-ups may not be. And I KNEW there was a reason I never trusted Ruby! Dean was right, demons are evil, period. She only helped the boys to serve her own agenda.<br />Just two of the highlights of this season are Dean screaming like a scared little girl at a kitten, (he'd been infected with a virus) and Jensen Ackle's performance in the scene where he tearfully tells Sam about what he went through in Hell. I was glad to see Bobby back again. Basically all of the cast knocked it out of the park this season, as well as the writers and other crew on the show.<br />So as for season 5, I have no idea how they will top Lucifer rising up from Hell, but I know they will! At the end of each season I always say they will never top this, but they always do. I'd have to say right now this is my favorite show on tv; it has the most imagination and the wildest plot twists and turns, but it's still easy to follow along. I'm glad their ratings have increased this year, they really deserve it. This is one of the most unfairly underrated shows on tv. If you like the show as much as me, it's your duty to get someone else hooked on it! That shouldn't be too hard.
0767812166|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Something of a poor man's E.T., Starman has a convincingly alien performance by Jeff Bridges and is reasonably entertaining for the majority of its running length without ever being especially good; it's a fine rental if you're a scifi fan but not a great offering by Carpenter.
0762434279|2.0|I was recomended this book, and saw great reviews on it, so I decided to buy it, and hope I could get some really useful information out of it.  yeah, not so much....  this is like an overview, I made the mistake of not noticing it is an abridged version.  Bad on my part!  I usually only buy childrens books and would've never expected this!  Well, I know better now!!  I'd just say, buy the full version.. this one doesn't seem to have that much useful info.  I think my 4 yr old would like more than me...
0792833279|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A sharp satire of the movie industry on one hand and a completely engrossing story on the other, Get Shorty is fun, funny, fast-moving, and the type of movie that you want to watch again within days of seeing it the first time: see it if you haven't.
0440246016|4.0|Lee Child infuses this well-written thriller with mini dramas along with an exciting revenge packed ending for his hero, Jack Reacher. He takes time to carefully lay out the plot,  filling the story with Reacher's credible sidekicks and evil doers.  One is reminded of Fredrick Forsyth's famously plotted  \\"The Day of the Jackal.\\" His action scenes are descriptive, paced and carefully researched. Fortunately, a slew of Reacher's novels awaits.
B000FZETIO|3.0|The Bottom Line:    It's a John Hughes teen film starring Molly Ringwald, so you know what you're getting before you walk in: there'll be some drama, some overacting, some unmanipulative and interesting material undermined by attempts at broad humor, and an ending designed to make everyone leave with a smile on his or her face, regardless of the logical contortions required to make it happen: watch it if that appeals to you.

B001DTPZNY|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Indiana Jones 4 hits the wrong notes from the start (kids driving while listening to rock music? In this franchise?) and never fixes itself; as a fan of the first three I found myself sinking into my seat, realizing with dawning horror that the movie kept finding ways to get worse--terrible CGI, an awful performance by Cate Blanchett, completely wasting John Hurt--and when it was over I couldn't believe that I had enjoyed National Treasure 2 more than an Indiana Jones movie.
B001TH16DI|5.0|When I pre-oredered this item I wondered if it would meet my expectations. I was concerned due to some of the negative reviews it received. Well, I can report not only did it meet my expectations, but surpassed them. I am very much satisfied with both picture and sound quality. A vast improvement in sight and sound over the DVD versions of these movies. Highly recommended to anyone, but best enjoyed with a 60\\"-73\\" large screen DLP HDTV and 7.1 sound system. Live long and prosper.
B000022TSY|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A deserved classic, Easy Rider functions so well as a capsule of its time that it should be used in history classes; that said, it's also a nearly-great motion picture that admittedly lags a bit in its first half hour but hits the ground running once Jack Nicholson comes aboard and never stops for breath.
037582913X|5.0|When a student in my pre-K class brought this book i remembered how much i liked it as a child.  So i had the children sit down and I read it to them.  Normally my class, 16 five year olds, wwould not sit still while i am reading a book, but this one they were hooked.  After i finished they had me read it 2 more times, I would recommend this book to anyone with children, its great
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A movie unlike any you've seen, with several of its most fascinating shots alone being worth the price of admission--no CGI was used in the film--and with a fascinating story to boot, The Fall was easily one of the best movies of 2008, even if the Academy thought otherwise; it's not a perfect film, but its memory and images will linger in your mind far longer than scenes from The Reader or Milk will.      3.5/4
1416955070|5.0|This book is a very good story that stays well paced throughout all pages with many twists, turns, surprises, and revalations. Overall, this book is very worth the purchase
B000BYA5GO|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Not only is Lord of War utterly fascinating, with good performances by Cage and Hawke, but unlike other movies that feature a protagonist making his living through things that kill people (like, say, Blow), Lord of War manages to both make us sympathize with the main character and yet realize how much he's helping evil to thrive; it's a film you'll remember and a film you should see.
B001GQACGE|1.0|Now many may call me a hater because I am so negative about this cd, but hey...I am stating the truth. Lets state the facts before anything....Beyonce is a BEAUTIFUL female with such a wonderful voice, but she has become so famous that she can make a BOGUS cd like this one, and everyone will like it. I was a HUGE Destiny's Child fan back in the day; the image of 4 beautiful girls with nice voices appealed to me! Every since Beyonce has decided to go solo, I find myself becoming more disappointed with her music! \\"Dangerously in Love\\" was actually not a bad album, however, her choice in what she calls music has went downhill from there. In my personal opinion, I feel as if Beyonce has become arrogant, self-absorbed, and down right cocky...and her lyrics reflect that! I actually had \\"I Am..Sasha Fierce\\" a month before it was released and I never really listened to it because of how \\"stuck on herself\\" Beyonce has become, and secondly, I was just down right tired of seeing/hearing her EVERYWHERE! When I finally got around to listening to the album, I have to admit, it took me all of 5 minutes to realize I hated it! Beyonce has a nice voice that can really be useful for the r&b genre, but the collection of songs on this album is MESS!  Dont get me wrong, \\"Single Ladies\\" grew on me and I found myself doing the dance every time I heard the song, but that was the only song that really appealed to me. Songs that made me cringe included \\"Video Phone, Diva, Radio, Sweet Dreams, and Ego.\\" Other songs are just so BORING you cant help but skip them! In my opinion, Beyonce has survived in the music business because of her beauty, sass, independence, and singing abilities, however, her music is not of QUALITY! Between the media and the mass of people who cannot recognize what MUSIC really is, they have completely turned me off from artists who try to be \\"unique\\" (because they can make MESS and get away with it! Sorry Beyonce, but you fit under this description! You have a talent that many would kill for! Use it for something other than the trash that takes 2 minutes to write! Thats why I say it over and over again...because music isnt what it used to be, I WILL STICK TO MY OLDIES!
B0013ND30M|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Yeah yeah it's a \\"classic\\" Disney film and therefore we're all supposed to wallow in its wake, but the fact remains that Sleeping Beauty is only a middling product from Walt & Co. whose momentum gets zapped once the Princess falls asleep and whose lead characters are really kinda boring; Cinderella this ain't.
0756405890|5.0|First let me start by saying that I am well versed in the fantasy genre.  Some of my favorites include GRRM's Song of Ice and Fire Series, Robin Hobbs (Farseer and Tawny Man Series), the Mists of Avalon, the Harry Potter Books, and All of Tolkien but particularly The Hobbit.  Others I have read and enjoyed but would not group in with the first batch are Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, David Farland, Anne Bishop, Raymond Feist and Lynn Flewelling.    In terms of books I recommend to others - both Fantasy readers and first timers - The Name of the Wind is at the top of my list.  One of the main reasons for these recommendations is the quality of the writing.  There is a heartbreaking beauty and lyricism to his writing that is evident from the very first page. It is a book teeming with genuine emotion, melodic imagination and compelling characters. Rothfuss can take something common place and find nuances that not only bring the object or situation to life but give it a vivid new life.  I enjoyed the language of this book so much that I have re-read it several times.  I find that even people who do not read fantasy books as a rule enjoy this one because of the writing.    Secondly, I found the characters in this book to be intriguing and exciting.  The main character is type of hero I love - a flawed overachiever struggling to make his way in the world.  But I also loved reading about Ben, Kvothe's Parents, Auri (a personal favorite), Elodin, Bast, and Fela.  In fact, with only one exception (Kvothe's love interest) I found that the writing gave excellent insight into the minds and motives of the characters.      I also found the concept of magic in this book very intriguing.  The idea of naming (knowing something so completely that you understand its secret core name) as a powerful magic source felt different and exciting to me.  I also enjoyed the acknowledgment that much of the \\"magic\\" perceived by the uneducated is actually a study of chemistry or physics in Kvothe's world as well as ours.  A well educated mind is the key to magic in this world rather than an inborn talent or a magic wand.      Some reviews have criticized the pace or plot of this novel.  I found both to be just fine for me.  I felt that both the sense of a driving emotional force present throughout the book and the sequence of the plot events kept things moving at a great pace.  For me this book was a page turner that I did not want to put down.  The book also contains a number of universal themes such as loss and coming of age which help add to it's appeal.    All in all - this is one of my favorite books and I am greatly looking forward to book two.  I hope others enjoy it as much as I have.  All of the people I have gifted copies to certainly have enjoyed it.     (I would also like to state for the record that I am in no way affiliated with the author, publisher, or anyone else who makes money off this book.  I am just a fantasy reader who found a book she loved.  Thanks!)
B00003CXBH|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Joffe, who was a pretty good director before he completely fell off the wagon, DeNiro (ditto, but substitute actor for director) and Irons certainly throw themselves into the film, and the cinematography is really pretty impressive, but the film doesn't offer much of interest below its pretty surface and I spent most of it wishing I was rewatching Aguirre the Wrath of God; I admired a lot about The Mission but I never felt I was drawn in.
0393324818|5.0|I read the whole thing at once!!!!! I could not stop.  It is a great real story and great insight into what baseball is all about.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  Compared to most of the comedies that have come out lately, it's really rather amazing.  I love the characters and the actors all did a really great job.  If you like British comedies, then you'll love Death at a Funeral. Recommended very highly by both me and my boyfriend.
0385736002|5.0|THIS BOOK AND THE TWO OTHERS THAT FOLLOW IT HAD ME SPELL BOUND. I READ ALL THREE IN THREE WEEKS. THE LAST ONE, \\"THE SORCERESS\\" HAD ME SO CAPTAVATED I READ IT IN THREE DAYS! THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT I CAN SAY WITH OUT GIVING A WAY THE THE WHOLE STORY. THERE ISN'T ANY THING I COULD SAY TO DO IT JUSTICE. JUST READ IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B00103584Y|5.0|Using the 'Multiple lives' concept, 'Run Lola Run' tells the story of Lola, who has 20 minutes to find the money needed to save his boyfriend's live if he does not pay it. The movie shows 3 alternate realities (or 'runs') which all start with Lola receiving a phone call from Manni (his boyfriend) asking for help, she leaves her house and start running to help him. Each 'run' while following the same path presents different situations according to Lola's timing while running with different results each time.<br /><br />The transfer to BD is simply stunning, featuring video 1080p HD/1:85:1, the colors are vibrant and Lola's hair never looked better, the video quality is such that details not noticeable in the DVD can easily be spotted on Bluray. For example, there is a scene where Lola is laying down on a street, in that scene is quite visible that the color of her hair was achieved by coloring over the film as you can see areas of her hair not colored equally. There are also some scenes that were recorded with a grainy filter (like the scenes at Lola's father's office). The detail and the grain was not that noticeable in the DVD compared to the rest of the film not using that filter.<br /><br />If you have seen this movie before you should know about how great the soundtrack is and how well it fits with the story being told, well, the German Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track included does justice to the incredible soundtrack. Portuguese and Spanish 5.1 are also included, though even with the small annoyance of subtitles, I rather watch the film in its original language.<br /><br />Same as the DVD counterpart, this release does not include many extras but the movie alone and its excellent transfer are very well worth the upgrade.
B002AR9YPI|5.0|This type of album is typically what I used to detest or very much dislike a few years back, and definitely in the 80's or 90's.  I have to say that my taste in modern times have changed in some areas drastically, but that is a good swing, so to speak.      Grizzly Bear's past albums are decent, but this one drowns with icing on the ultimate cake.  Each song seems to be produced articulately with precise fickleness, but definitely in a good form, if you ask me.    On the first two tracks \\"Southern Point\\" and \\"Two Weeks\\" seem to breathe the other fabulous group Animal Collective, which are one of my favorites as well.  Not that I'm saying Grizzly Bear or Animal Collective have copied one or the other.  At any perspective, they are both top notch groups with a head of gold.  Grizzly Bear's latest outing 'Veckatimest' is one of my top 10 albums of 2009 so far, and I hope they continue on this path of combining acoustics with dense clouds of modern keyboarding.  Cheers to GB!
B001FB55YE|3.0|I found it a little bit difficult to finally decide to watch this movie after Guy Ritchie's last films. I am a big fan of 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels', so when a friend of mine told me this movie was on that same line I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />'RocknRolla' tells the story of a Russian businessman who asks a London mobster for help in closing a real estate deal. In between we will see the story of all the characters involved in trying to make the deal happen, those trying to make the deal not to happen, and... you get the idea. While I have to admit I found the movie quite enjoyable and funny, I couldn't help to be reminded of 'Snatch\\", there is even a sequence in which Gerard Butler's character, 'One Two' and accomplices try to steal a briefcase with money that reminded me of the bookies sequence in 'Snatch'<br /><br />The movie takes places in the same universe as'Snatch', so if you liked that movie you will certainly like 'RocknRolla'. This is an elaborated crime story with funny moments and a great soundtrack, a classic Guy Ritchie film.<br /><br />Video quality (1080p HD 16x9 2:4:1) is superb, the night scenes look stunning on HD (take the night scene at Uri's boat for example) and the sound does not disappoint either, Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital in English, 5.1 for French, Spanish and Portuguese.<br /><br />Extras included are a commentary by Guy Ritchie and Mark Strong (who narrates the movie and plays 'Archy') Some additional scenes are included as well but they are not that relevant and is easy for you to tell why they were not included in the movie. Two short documentaries are also included, 'Inside RocknRolla' and 'Guy's town'
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is the best nature series that I've ever seen. The HD brings it to life, and the photography is just astounding. The series has concentrated on flora and fauna rarely seen and some never before filmed. This is a must for any nature lover!
1932100660|5.0|I would recommend this book for anyone interested in improving overall health and control weight.
0394818237|5.0|This was one of my favorite books as a child and is now my son's favorite.  Very entertaining and the cut-out sections showing the reader what is \\"going on underground\\" is fascinating for a four year.  Great book.
0553103547|5.0|Excellent book inspired by the War of the Roses in England. It set in Westeros, a fantastic continent which is featured by seasons that longs for years. There, lots of characters lived and died in a passionate game to conquest power while a terrible shadow spread over the North that threatened the human life in all the continent.<br /><br />A very good book that can compete with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and that has set up the new paradigm of the fantastic novel.
B000YABYLA|4.0|I didn't want to write \\"treatment of teen pregnancy\\" because that makes it seem like a sociological treatise  and this is definitely not that. What makes this film so good is that it is fresh, like life, and doesn't attempt to preach about anything. Yes, a teenage girl gets pregnant accidentally and the story is about what she does about it. I liked the unexpected turns the film takes.  I liked the way most of the characters are portrayed as humans, with good and not-so-good qualities.  The dad is maybe the most saintly but he is sufficiently scruffy to still be likeable.  The step-mom is interesting because she's initially presented as someone very uncool --she loves dogs and in a manicurist--but she turns out to be incredibly strong and supportive of Juno, even as she keeps her own sharp tongue.  It was the most likeable character I've seen Allison Janney portray in a while--usually she's stuck with really unpleasant, uptight types.      My only problem was with Juno.  As many others have mentioned (check the reviews giving the lower scores) she is so excessively smart-mouthed that I actually gave up caring about her about halfway through the film.  She is 16, going on 38, and every word out of her mouth is so clever that it really is annoying.  I loved her boyfriend, Paulie, though. He is her opposite, a real dorky, awkward, sincere, not terribly cute kid.  Her girlfriend is great too--not nearly as clever but with a lot of enthusiasm.     The married couple who seek to adopt Juno's baby are very well written and played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.  Each of them has flaws and some viewers will side with one or the other.  I think the genius of the film is that they are both shown completely realistically.  I felt a lot of affection for both of them.  The relationship between Mark (Bateman) and Juno has struck some as inappropriate but it seemed very natural to me, and again, that's how life can happen.      I loved the ending...it was not what I expectedand it seemed very true and hearwarming.     All in all, it's a very good film...I give it four and a half stars.
0312370849|2.0|This book is an example of story that had lots of potential but was poorly written. Sarah's story was tragic and compelling, and though fictional, it was a good representation of the many tragic and very real stories that actually happened at the time. The intertwining story of modern day journalist Julia Jarmond, however, I found to be quite dull and a distraction from Sarah's story. Overall, the book was predictable and thus a little boring. After Sarah's story ended, I found the continuation/conclusion of Julia's story to be uninteresting and quite cliche.     In summary, I wouldn't recommend this book. You can learn more about the events that took place in Paris in 1942 from other sources. But if you're looking for a fictional account of moral dilemma and the psychological impact of the Holocaust on survivors, I would strongly recommend [[ASIN:0679602895 Sophie's Choice (Modern Library)]] over this book.
0810994739|5.0|Another great book about Greg and his many adventures. Though, I didn't like this one as well as I liked the first, it doesn't mean Kinney shouldn't deserve great praise. These illustrated books about the funniest parts of being a kid are well worth the read for kids and nostalgic adults alike. I will be reading the third book as soon as I can get my hands on it.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I have been a fan of Clint Eastwood the actor and the   producer-director for most of my life and this man very rarely   leaves his audience disappointed!--He is a master storyteller   and embodies his characters wholly and completely!--This movie,   about a gruff, bigoted man who's neighborhood is changing in ways   that he doesn't like is classic Eastwood contridiction with   an undercurrent of humanity and a message about the   values of tolerance without being all \\"afterschool special\\" on us!  And of course, there's plenty of Clint Eastwood at his   butt-kicking best! I don't like to give scene by scene rundowns   in my reviews because I want you all to see and judge it   for yourselves. But this is a brilliantly acted and directed film   and a definite MUST HAVE for your DVD collection.
0307383415|4.0|There are many more reviews of this book than even the most careful buyer would want to read. So why add one more? Well, I was struck by the strong relationship in many of the existing reviews between the reviewer's opinion of the book and his/her apparent political leanings. Understandable, certainly, since it is not only style but content that satisfies a reader, and many of these reader/reviewers take the content of this book to be Barack Obama's life and political philosophy.    If, however, one is interested in learning, not what, but HOW the man thinks - the workings of his mind - the book acquires far greater value. Love him or despise him, Obama is currently the most powerful leader in the world, and he is likely to be one of the most prominent figures of this historical period. The book is a quick and pleasant read but, more important, it was written entirely by Obama himself, and the reader can watch his mind at work, thinking through the challenges he sees before him. If I was considering whether to buy the book, I'd ask myself: How could I not read it?
B001SMC91M|4.0|I have to say that \\"Tell `em What Your Name Is\\" will not wow the critical crowd who like to sift through nuances and name drop comparisons with the great soul and R&B singers who preceded Black Joe Lewis. Although he may not a great vocalist in the technical sense, good lord, the man breathes plenty of life into these songs, sometimes noted to be garage soul or punk soul. (I cannot understand half of what he is singing either, but I like the way he sings it.)<br /><br />Whatever genre one wants to tack on to this band, Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears lay down a mean groove and then rummage through a host of \\"influences\\" to churn out a tasty blend of funk, blues, soul, and rock in no particular order.<br /><br />The Honeybears add plenty of wallop and punch, nailing the hooks, and locking in with a tight rhythm driven sound burnished by horns, keyboards, and guitars on this short set of tunes (just over half an hour). I would just advise folks not to over think this music, sneak it on when your friends are not paying attention, and count how many folks ask \\"who is that?\\" before you tell `em what its name is.
0575082372|3.0|House of Suns is an enjoyable read. But I can't help but feel various earlier works exceed it (Revelation Space, Chasm City, The Prefect, etc...). I suppose it is always hardest to compete against yourself.    (spoilers)    I have a few points in mind. The whole Palacial backstory that fills pages and pages.  I kept waiting for it to somehow be integrated into the main story in some meaningful way.  It never happened.  Why was it there? And then the whole point that one of the shatterlings is indeed not a clone at all.  But... we never hear which one. And as some reviewers pointed out, there are moments where you get the impression that the author is trying to engender some feeling of awe and grandeur and... doesn't.  All is not mediocre though.  I enjoyed the whole meeting with Hesperus, and the ambush and all that.

But it's been so worth it!  I already had strong legs from running a couple miles a few times a week, but now my legs are pretty diesel.  The fat around my upper thighs is slowly thinning out, as is the fat around my midsection.  I fit into a size four jean today!  This is simply an amazing work out.  If you can push it through the first few days of intensely sore muscles, you will definitely see results.

0743270754|5.0|If you read only one book about Lincoln and the Civil War, or even if, like me, you have read many, read this one.  By quoting extensively from the letters and diaries of those who knew Lincoln, Kearns is able to recreate the man, quoting exactly what he said, not just the big speeches, but what he said to Mary, to his colleagues, to his generals, to Frederick Douglass, to an injred soldier. She even notes his body language, how he clasped someone's hand or put an arm around his shoulder.  The first two chapters, as she sets the scene and introduces us to the characters, are very slow going, but then it reads like an absorbing novel and, for the duration of 700+ pages, you are transported back to the 1860's into the White House and traveling on boats with Lincoln, riding horseback with him, even sharing his fried oyster supper at the telegraph office when he got the 1864 election results.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is a excellent vampire film.  Not a simple slasher horror film, you can almost consider this a film about people who just happen to be vampires as opposed to a Vampire horror film.  From the opening credits to the ending credits it develops a mood, a dark mood, and vampirism is handled with subltety as opposed to the regular Holly Wood vampire movie.  There's no fangs, no religious priests holding up crosses, no driving stakes in hearts, it avoids all of those vampire cliches and breathes fresh air into a worn out genre.  But I must caution those with American sensibilities, who might find some of the sexuality in the film disturbing since this is a Swedish film with a European take on sexuality.    Some complain about the subtitles I haven't seen the original theatrical realease and I doubt most have, so I don't know what I'm missing if anything, becasue I doubt this film could be much better.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great book and great series. I'm always on the lookout for boy-friendly books, and these are great ones.    Strangely, there is a minor difference between the Kindle and Hardcover versions of this book. Near the end, in the book, a signal is sent using blue lights. On the Kindle, the signal is sent with a blue flag. I'm not sure why there would be a difference--perhaps different drafts of the manuscript.
1433503794|5.0|I bought my ESV Study Bible because I like the ESV version and I wanted a study Bible. I have been very pleased with it. The information & notes help to understand how the culture and events of the time the passage was written give insight into the passage you are reading. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good study Bible.
B001HYX3IY|2.0|I loved listening to this book on tape.  It was like attending an Anthro.101 class taught by a brilliant instructor.  Unfortunately, the vendor from whom I ordered this book as a gift for friend who spends much time in the car, sent a print version instead of the audio version he listed.  In print, the book is more difficult - I never made it past the third chapter.  I highly recommend the audio book, just beware of getting the wrong format.

B00005JM0B|3.0|This week's Sid the Elf feature is Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This film was just another step along our path to review every movie Arnold ever made. Well, except for the awful Conan movies. This one followed the ridiculously successful [[ASIN:B00008PC2O Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)]]. By conventional wisdom, this film failed miserably when compared to its predessor. But, by B standards it might have been just a touch better even though it lacked the same awesomeness that caused us to give T2 5 stars.<br /><br />The B-ness of this flick was almost overwhelming. There's Arnold and his snare drum tight face. There's the fact that they needed to replace the extremely popular(in T2) Edward Furlong for Nick Stahl due to a substance abuse problem. Oh yeah! Also, they supposedly recycled a bunch of ideas that didn't make the cut for T2 such as the female Terminator. Arnold is still protecting John Connor against Skynet and their female Terminator. Arnold also has to protect Claire Daines(John's future wife), a tough job for anyone to get motivated for. Sophia Bush was originally slated for this role. That would have added a star at least. O well. The big wrinkle in this one is that we find out that the T-X is back in good old 2004 from the future to not only kill John Connor, but his lieutenants too. Why? Because she kills John Connor in 2032. But we've already seen that history can be rewritten once because Judgment Day didn't occur in 1997 as predicted in Da Terminator. The question is: Can history be rewritten again?<br /><br />Sadly, this movie fell short. Maybe it was the lack of Arnold lines none of which we would find on a soundboard. Also, the appeal of the indestructability of the T-X was a bit old as we saw that already in T2. Aside from a few cool plot points this one just felt rehashed from the previous films. Sid says its a stay-away. We would NOT have enjoyed this one back in the glory days.

B001WCBPCW|5.0|First off, Kasabian has got to be the most underrated band in the United States. This being their third release and could possibly be the best one yet. The songs are very strong, catchy beats, and great lyrics. With 60's psych, electronic, and 90's rock all blended together, what you get is a fantastic mix of songs that all come together very nice and tight. The boys from Leicester have done it again with another brilliant release. This is a must have cd of the year that will keep you moving and grooving  for the ages. Stop what you are doing and buy this release along with Kasabian's first two releases.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|In Funhouse, Pink continues to ask the listener to go on a journey within.  Her soulful, gritty vocals and sense of 'right now' are on beautiful display in this album.  Even in the more 'fun' songs like the title track and \\"So What,\\" there is an undercurrent of holding true to yourself through whatever life or hol.ywood or the media throw at you.  Like Madonna, Pink slips deep and powerful meaning into even her most 'commercial' songs.  A journey of absolute meaning, concealed in some really danceable music. Well done!

While the writing was beautifully descriptive, the action well-executed and aspects of the world inventive, the story itself went nowhere.  When I finished, it was like I just read a really over-written prologue, as opposed to the first volume in an epic.  The best parts for me were the present-day scenes; they bode well for more action to come.  I may read the next one, but unfortunately, I don't feel like I need to, and that's what my inner fantasy geek craves: a compelling story that I can't stop reading.
0930289234|4.0|A couple of months ago, I developed an interest in comics, so I took a trip to Barnes and Noble and bought this. I started reading it at home right away, making sure it was not a waste of $20 (which is HIGHWAY ROBBERY for a paperback!). Luckily, it was worth every cent. Telling by the first sentence in 'Watchmen\\", I could tell it would not be a book where a superhero in a neon costume and tights would be saving a woman from falling out of a building. There are a couple of \\"classic comic book rescues\\", but for the most part, the story and dialogue is actually quite dark. For example, (spoiler alert!) a man shoots a pregnant woman in the chest, killing her. \\"Watchmen\\" also has elements of science fiction, for fans of that particular genre. It also often has extremely intense action. This book is so literary and filled with great quality writing, that you forget it is a graphic novel. I would not reccomend \\"Watchmen\\" to young children who might be somewhat frightened bacause of all the blood and gore. Actually, this book is not FOR little kids, so do not get tricked into thinking it is a graphic novel like Batman or Superman. but I would reccomend it for anyone who is looking for a comic book with depth, and for those who are just lloking for a good read.
B001P3SA8U|5.0|If you love rock and roll music and you appreciate it's history, you will love this movie. Great sound, great music, great performances and solid acting.  This movie confirms in my mind who the ultimate father of rock and roll really is and how the Rolling Stones came up with the name for their band. Very interesting.
B0017R5UAA|2.0|I cannot believe the hype that goes into the perpetual search for the next big thing.  Iron and Wine is so much better, this is just lame and boring.  Fleet Foxes obviously put a lot of effort into this album, but UHHGGGGG!  I don't like the Arcade Fire, I don't like Vampire Weekend, and I don't like Fleet Foxes.
B001VS46DC|3.0|Oh Diana.................. where did you go so badly wrong, were you missing the kids, head cold? I buy your albums for a refreshing buzzz Here in Brazil it should have swarmed with magical opertunity..............but no boring reflections of past music, great music performed  badly  Sorry I would like my money back    6/9/2009. You know I just might have been wrong. After a lot of playing Its growing I suspect it might have been the transfer of English to a Brazilian audence? I would have liked more Brazilian guests and more latern composers!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0790742780|1.0|as I am reviewing the product I am giving only one star because Amazon has wrong information for this DVD; according with the product details this movie has spanish audio, however I bought it and audio and subtitles are only in english and french.    I can't understand why Amazon gives wrong information for users.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This movie is about alot of things but one things for sure, it will make you love it and maybe even make you cry.
B002BI4Y06|3.0|Wonder why the 2-disc CD of this same release is $4 cheaper... Amazing band with heavy metal expert musicianship. Highly recommend purchasing this title - only on CD. Why not save money?
0425166805|5.0|This book is absolutely fascinating. It is extremely well researched and full of interesting details, facts and a critical analysis by the author of world mysteries that would make even the most skeptical wonder \\"what if\\". What is especially nice is that the author leaves us with a series of questions on which to ponder rather than trying to force his own view on the reader. It is no wonder that this book has maintained its appeal throughout the years. The only negative in my view, is the photos. Being in black and white they are a little difficult to view but this may be so because that was what was available when the book was first published. Moreover excellent copies of the similar images can be viewed on the internet.
B001W63DX2|3.0|I don't understand why the people that make the maiden dvds can't focus in on something for more than 1 or 2 seconds. That older Rio DVD gave me a headache watching it from all the flipping around. This one flips around alot but not quite as much. I also don't really care to see so many shots of the crowd. Yes I know they are excited and jumping around, but when I got to a concert I go to see the performers, not other people.    Edit to my review below.  Also notable, the audio on this dvd is lacking depth that was on the Rio dvd. I compared the audio between the two. The Rio DVD audio was significantly better with much more bottom end in the dvd. To be fair I was using the DTS tracks from both dvds.
B000000H5K|5.0|Stop what your doing right now and buy this album...anyone who doesnt have this album should be smacked by law. Nuff said.
B001GQACGO|5.0|If you havent purchased this album by now, youve been missing out on some great music.  You will love the slow songs like Halo, Broken Hearted Girl, Disappear, and Smash Into You. They are all beautiful love songs to relax.  Now, the other side of the CD has amazing dance songs like the 5-week #1 single: Single Ladies, as well as Radio, Diva, and Video Phone, and my fave: Sweet Dreams.  It gives ya the best of both worlds.  The price is worth it, even if the other version is cheaper, dont get the other one--get this Deluxe Edition.  you wont stop listening to it for a long long while
0439882826|5.0|Any child with even a passing interest in Star Wars will love this incredible book.
0810970686|5.0|I've not read this series, however, my \\"just turned\\" 9yr old son absolutely loves it. I'm very glad this is out there and helps him to enjoy reading. Slowly we are moving him to the classics. These type of books help! Thank you.
B001HN697M|5.0|Rise of the Lycans is a fantastic movie.  It is true to the story line set by the first 2 movies released.  I like how it ties together all the loose ends and questions that arise from watching the first 2 movies.  This is a must see!
0446310786|5.0|This book is delicately contrived and each character and scene is portrayed beautifully.  A wonderful book - touching, memorable and utterly enduring; a treasure for every reader of every age over 10.
0307408833|4.0|I think this book is great so far.  I made some cookies which were delicious.  They remained soft, which is a bonus for a \\"healthy\\" cookie.  I put healthy in quotations because the chocolate chip cookie recipe does use quite a bit of sugar, but most recipes use Agave Nectar instead of sugar.  The coconut oil left a mild coconut flavor which really complimented the cookies.  Coconut oil is used often so if you hate that flavor I would not buy this book.
B00144VBBS|5.0|If your a Toby fan make sure you have this one in your collection. It's got em all!!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE for any Leonard Cohen fan.  I witnessed his live concert in Detroit and this DVD certainly captures the flavor and intensity of the show.  To see Mr. Cohen's passion as a performer and to hear his meaningful songs is an experience not soon forgotten. I love this DVD and I love the music and essence of Leonard Cohen.  And to see him at age 74 shows us that age is not a limit.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Needed to have the completed season and this was the best way to go about it. Love it
0316017922|3.0|The book is a great read. It seems realistic if Publishers Clearing House had you waiting at the door on weekends. Gladwell gives facts about how individuals are different and what sets them apart, but it doesn't apply to the masses. I kept wondering about other Outliers. I really don't care about Gate's and Job's, I want to know about the people who have lived with terminal cancer for 48 years. His research (if you call it research) only dealt with well known people. I needed some umph. I didn't get it.
B00002DEGZ|5.0|These are all the concerto's as played on the fortepiano, the instrument for which Mozart composed them.  They are worth hearing because one can hear the fleet passage work on the lighter instrument.  However, on my stereo the orchestra sounded much louder than the soloist so I had to adjust the volume a lot. This would not be the case with a modern piano.
B0026UV77C|4.0|Is this Bush?  Sure sounds like Bush.  At least the lyrics make sense.  Doesn't sound all that origional, more like Meds outakes.  Oh well, their outakes are probably better than most bands' best of. Seriously,  another very good album from a really good band.
B001UE27X8|3.0|Regarding my copy of The Complete Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Recordings....Disc two is great and I have enjoyed listening to it.  Disc one had no information recorded on it.... no sound.  It is the first time this has happened to me.  I tried to contact Amazon.com, but was unsuccessful. I would very much like to have a new copy of disc one and would gladly return the defective one. I have been unable to figure out how to contact you in this matter.  Thank you.    John Schairer
0393974650|5.0|This is a really nice edition of this book. The indexes in the back provide a lot of insight into the author and the times.
B000002J7U|5.0|If you like Vangelis than this will be a purchase worth taking. Best track; Ask the Mountains which has the vocals & lyrics by Stina Nordenstam, Awesome!. Don't miss-out on this one.
B0024RID6U|5.0|\\"Tatto You\\",released in 1981,was the band's last undisputed classic album,containing their signature song \\"Start Me Up\\" along with other standouts as \\"Hang Fire\\",the reggage-funk workout \\"Slave\\",Keith's raunchy rocker \\"Little T&A\\",the sweetly soul \\"Worried About You\\",and the gentle \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" complete with jazz legend Sonny Rollins's solo.The 1994 Virgin remaster was a big improvment over the dull 80's CBS disc,so while this 2009 UMG remaster isn't a night-and-day experience like the other UMG Stones remasters,it is a bit improved in terms of clarity(especially in the guitars and vocals)and warmth.It would be quite awhile before the Rolling Stones got this good after this album.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|I haven't viewed the actual DVD's yet, but the goodies that come with this special package are of the highest quality and I am very pleased and satisfied. This is not a cheap paper box with a couple of cheesy promotional items. (Ok, there's some cheesiness, but isn't that the point?)    The outer covering of the box, made to look like a fringe leather jacket or vest,  seems to be actual leather or something close enough to it. There's an iron-on patch affixed to the outside, I like it right where it is and will keep it with the rest of the goodie-box. The lucite paperweight with Woodstock photo images is pretty cool, better than most album swag. The Life magazine reprint is most definitely worth owning and reading, and the printing and papers used for all of the DVD cases, reprints, photography and otherwise are of a very high quality. There's even a ticket repro and some reproductions of the paper plates and such that were used for the message board (very reminiscent of the hotel receipt repros in the Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\").     So, I like what I see so far. I'll watch the DVD's at some point this summer. Maybe 10 years from now I'll have Blu-Ray and will get the 50th-anniversary edition in that format.

B000TGCR38|4.0|loosely based on truth,a fine film with SUB TITLES...and a dame who  steps out and up to the plate to make a difference.  You can quickly pinpoint a villain or two,recognize the heroine but there is a twist so watch out...and watch it
B001KYJA6K|5.0|I have become obsessed with this disc.  After one hearing, I decided it was great iPod material and imported it right away, and I just keep listening.  These performers understand that Monteverdi was one of the great songwriters and most popular composers of his time, and that it was a time that valued improvisation and imagination in the performance of music.  They supply the imagination in spades!  They even provide some \\"swing\\" to a few of the songs, with no announcement in the booklet that this will be happening.  When I played this for a friend whose sole exposure to Monteverdi so far was the 1610 Vespers, he said \\"No way, that's not Monteverdi.\\"  But it IS Monteverdi.  I especially enjoyed Philippe Jaroussky's work in two solo songs and two excerpts from The Coronation of Poppea. Nuria Rial is splendid in selections from the late madrigal books.  Pluhar and her ensemble play Monteverdi like the popular composer that he was. The imaginative accompaniments are faithful to the originals but take off in delightful directions.  I wish they would record a follow-up - there is so much great Monteverdi material of this type, and they've but scratched the surface!
B001EO748M|5.0|take a bit of history,add a few beautiful actors and a dash of sex and what do you have but a great program that leave you wanting for more and hardly  able to wait for the next season...poetic license has been use a bit but a great watch.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|We've only used it once, but it's a really nice size, and doesn't get too deep for the little ones.  The slide, yes, as others have said, is not sturdy enough to actually ride on, but my son pushes his toys down it and likes to see them just slide themselves.  Easy to inflate.
044661758X|4.0|I love this story.  And it is a great piece of writing.  As a lawyer, though, I have to downgrade a star because Connelly seems out of his element in the courtroom aspect.  No judge, especially the by the book judge here, would allow a \\"police shooting case\\" to devolve into the guilt or innocence of the victim.  It is simply irrelevant to the trial whether the guy Bosch shot was the Dollmaker or not.  The issue is whether his move for the pillow justified the shooting.  I just don't get that most of the trial is about the guile or innocence of the guy that got shot.  98% of the \\"evidence\\" at the trial would never have been admitted, or -- at a minimum -- the case would have been bifurcated as between liability (whether it was a good shooting) and damages (how much loss is associated with a shooting if it were adjudicated \\"bad\\").  No way the jury would have heard all of those arguments at the liability stage.

B001F12J0C|5.0|GREAT DEAL FOR THREE GREAT MOVIES. GETTING ALL THREE AT ONCE IS ALWAYS A DEAL
0765316897|3.0|EDIT (03/16/2014):  Upon re-reading this book (almost 5 years from my first reading), I'm updating my review just a bit.  In general, I'm now happy with the depth of the characterizations:  the characters now seem properly developed for their roles in the book.  On the other side of the ledger, I still feel that the book is too drawn out and padded.  The rest of my original comments, below, still stand.<br /><br />___ ORIGINAL REVIEW ___<br /><br />\\"The Hero of Ages\\" is the third in Brandon Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" series. It pretty much exhibits the same traits as the previous two volumes (amazingly creative universe and magic system, good technical writing, not-so-great character development, and TOO MANY WORDS). So, if you liked those books, you should be pretty happy with this one. But, if you were hoping the series would get better as it progressed, well, you'll probably be disappointed. From my capitalized phrase, above, you can guess that my biggest complaint is that, just like the second book, fully the first two thirds of the book is just filler (it's a bit better than what's in the earlier book since the filler at least has some action occurring, even if it's busy work). And, once again, the last third is the very good part where everything happens. Again, if Sanderson had just condensed those first 400 pages down to 100 pages, the book would have been great.  So, unfortunately, the best I can rate this book is merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels currently in Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" series are:<br /><br />1, 2, and 3.  [[ASIN:B004H1TQBW Mistborn Trilogy]] <== Get this omnibus edition -- it's cheaper than the three separate books<br />4.  [[ASIN:B00540QR7Q The Alloy of Law: A Mistborn Novel]]
B001NZVS8E|5.0|With Blink-182 making their highly anticipated reunion, it's easy to see the effect that they've had on an entire generation, which changed their musical habits forever. When most of the world was in the unfortunate grip of bad pop and hip-hop, this group of guys clearly didn't care, and did their own thing. It was simple, at times immature, but at all times fun, and the band clearly knew their audience. Unfortunately, it's in reviewing an album like this it's hard to separate the legend from the quality. Is it classic rock, or immature crap? That'd all depend on your demographic.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />Dumpweed<br />Aliens Exist<br />What's My Age Again?<br />All The Small Things<br />Anthem<br /><br />For someone who grew up with this, it's classic rock at some of it's finest. It really birthed the pop-punk genre, it rocked from start to finish, the music and the lyrics were classic, and the album had a nice flow to it, so it also made for a nice overall project. It's almost revolutionary in this sense and even though I've grown up since the release of the album, the other day somebody asked me to act my age, and I said, \\"What's my age again?\\" Yeah, this album is/was pretty awesome.<br /><br />From a legend point, it's pretty legendary and influential. From quality point, it clearly did something right to bring a genre to the mainstream, and rocket it on the path it followed for the rest of the decade. In fact, most of the new pop-punk bands of the past 5 years had at least some influence from Blink.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|it was fast getting to the house and it was in good shape very happy with the product would do it again
0930289234|3.0|And I am glad that I did, although I wouldn't call it one of the 100 top best novels of all time.<br /><br />I have read comics and graphic novels before, the genre is not totally new to me, so the style didn't really affect my view of the book.  I did find the novel confusing at points, with the main story being interupted by flashbacks and the \\"reading\\" of the Pirate comic.  It did wrap itself up though nicely at the end and it all made sense.<br /><br />I thought the setting was precise, having grown up in Cool War years that the novel presents.  I also like the Rorschach character (looking forward now to see how that works out in the movie).<br /><br />Maybe I had too much expectation for it, reading the critical reviews that are quoted on the back. It was a different read, I will give it that.

1845767055|5.0|WOW! Paul Bonner is just amazing. Book was in brand new condition and arrived within stated time frame.  It was a present so I couldn't wait to get it. If you enjoy art of the 'Rings or Warcraft variety you won't be disappointed.
0739328468|5.0|An excellent read about events of recent times.  Although,it was not at my request it arrived in LARGE PRINT.  This was ideal as I placed the book on my treadmill and read it for an hour a day whilst exercising.  I had to discipline myself not to continue reading when I was off the treadmill. This was difficult as it is such a gripping yarn.  Enjoy the read and I am sure that you will agree with me.

0375836675|5.0|If this book does not stir your emotions and cause you to analyze your life, you really should give up reading.  I'm not sure why this is considered a Young Adult novel, because I'm an old one and it is without a doubt the best book I've ever read.  I don't want to spoil the ending for potential readers, but I suggest to all the reviewers who don't understand it to reread the last five pages(paperback version), to include the information that follows the conclusion of the actual story.  It's a who-dunnit that YOU have to figure out and all the clues are right there...you just have to SEE it.  Marcus Zusack is a genius!!!
