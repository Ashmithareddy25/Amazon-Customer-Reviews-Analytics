B000002UAU|5.0|By 1967 The Beatles had become a studio band only as they had stopped touring the previous year,and so began in late 1966 the 129 days session of what would become the \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" album.At the time of release the band didn`t know what reaction from fans to expect as this was a make it or break it album for them,they had lost some fans previously and the future was uncertain.All that stress for nothing,Sgt Peppers turned out to be an incredible album that was exeptionnal at the time of release in the summer of love in 1967.This was actually a concept album and an idea of Paul McCartney`s truly,who wanted The Beatles to be a totaly different band for this particular release and the rest of the band went along with it.It made them experiment with things and do some different stuff like George Harrison did on \\"Whithin You Without You\\" in wich he experimented with nearly indian music and diverse instruments.<br /><br />That is not to say everybody agreed,Ringo said it was his least favourite Beatles album,but even they(The Beatles)didn`t realize how much of a masterpiece it was and it became one of the most praised rock albums of all time.It is ranked first on many lists of top albums(including the rock`n`roll hall of fame`s)so there is definatly something good about it.The album`s cover is what most people think of when you talk about the album,it was truly iconic at the time with all the celebrities on it,its impressive.For Sgt Pepper,what The Beatles did is say `hey why don`t we become a different band for this one?`and that`s what they did,for this album they were \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".There was supposed to a chronological oder for the songs on the album according to Paul and `All the songs were already written and they just fitted in`,he said.Whatever the concept was or the order of the songs are,or were supposed to be its still a great album from beggening to end.<br /><br />As one could expect the songwritting remains excellent as it was troughout most of The Beatles`s albums and singles.They always kept it simple on that point,but still great wich is better than a lousy song with brilliant writting.Only they could do a song about fixing a hole and still make a good song out of it,wich they did on this album,yet they can make songs with a meaning and a message in it like they can do just a fun song with no meaning at all.That`s the magic of The Beatles,everything they do seems to work,at least for them.Sgt Peppers has great songs like the classic \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\"(often said to be about LSD tought John Lennon said it wasn`t),or \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" sung by Ringo Starr(who does a great job on it!),\\"Getting Better\\" is a great song as well and so is \\"For The Benefit Of Mr.Kite!\\".I don`t really need to go trough each song to tell you how amazing this album really is,you probably already knew it anyway!<br /><br />Before this album,no one really considered rock`n`roll as art but with \\"Sgt Peppers\\" it all changed and it turned a few people`s head to see what was happening.This albums gets a lot of credit and its well deserved.Being a concept record it allowed them to be creative wich they certainly did,as some said those might be the most creative 129 days in the history of rock.In fact even the album`s sleeve was revolutionary!It changed the way other album sleeves were being made. The band had an unmatched impact on music and for the time it was Sgt Peppers was very important and put simply,this is a masterpiece,there is no denying it.Even if you like other Beatles albums more or you don`t even like them you have to understand that in the first place.I am conviced you will like Sgt Peppers and its definatly a must to any rock listener`s collection,you have to have this!All that can be said is that this album is truly great and it might not be The Beatles`s best but its certainly a masterpiece.5 stars at least!was troughout most of The Beatles`s albums and singles.They always kept it simple on that point,but still great wich is better than a lousy song with brilliant writting.Only they could do a song about fixing a hole and still make a good song out of it,wich they did on this album,yet they can make songs with a meaning and a message in it like they can do just a fun song with no meaning at all.That`s the magic of The Beatles,everything they do seems to work,at least for them.Sgt Peppers has great songs like the classic \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\"(often said to be about LSD tought John Lennon said it wasn`t),or \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" sung by Ringo Starr(who does a great job on it!),\\"Getting Better\\" is a great song as well and so is \\"For The Benefit Of Mr.Kite!\\".I don`t really need to go trough each song to tell you how amazing this album really is,you probably already knew it anyway!

B0010KHOS0|5.0|On March 25th, 2008, Fox Home Entertainment released Walk The Line 2-Disc Extended Cut. The DVD features the following...    Disc 1:    Extended Cut (153 mins.)

They range from featurettes about the movies production such as the music, casting...etc.    Unless you really enjoyed Walk The Line, I seriouslly doubt you will double or even triple dip for this release. But if you really enjoyed it then an upgrade is warranted.
B000IU3XTW|3.0|I say \\"disappointing\\" but that's really unfair because I'm a hard-core Foo Fighters fan.  There is very little in this CD that makes me want to go back and listen to it day in and day out (as I did with One by One and the Color and the Shape).  In short, pass unless you want to round out your collection.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope gets another DVD release. A lot of people have complained about the 1997 and 2004 versions of the film however, I find this one in particular better with the CGI enhancements. It is nostalgic to go back and watch the 1977 verison on disc 2, however it is not presented in anamorphic widescreen, and only presented in Dolby 2.0. That is fine with me, since I prefer to watch the updated version of the film which is presented in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 ex sound. Yes, I agree Greedo shooting first was a bad idea, but I'm over it. I love Star Wars, and this film is the one that started it all. I can't wait until the film is updated for digital 3-D, so I can hear all the new complaints by purists who feel that a film should not be tampered with after it's initial release.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|OH, you guys.  What complete fun.  I am a newcomer to the Atlantis series, and I 'm not quite finished with Season 3, but I love it already.  So often we think that we want characters that are cool, tough, trendy, etc.  Of course, Atlantis does have characters that are cool, trendy, smart, etc.  But what also want unpredictability.  I love Rodney McKay's character because he isn't the typical character, but underneath he's loves, he feels, and he is evolving.  He is also unpredictable, and we cheer when he finally \\"sees\\" something.  I just finished the \\"Tao of Rodney.\\" Absolutely loved it.  Loved \\"McKay and Mrs. Miller.\\"  I must say I also enjoy it when they show the other character's oddities, eccentricities, etc.  It makes it fun.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B00003CX5P|4.0|When Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was released in theaters in May of 1999, I was one of those crazed fans camping out for the midnight showing. Having grown up with the original trilogy (episodes IV-VI), I had very high expectations for the first film in the prequels. The visual effects did not disappoint, however, the film was not without its problems. The main villian in the film, Darth Maul, promised to be the ultimate bad guy of the Star Wars saga. Although the character, played by Ray Park, was very menacing, I felt the movie spent too much time on the hated Jar Jar Binks, and not nearly enough screen time was given to Darth Maul, making Jar Jar the most hated character in Star Wars history. The film does, however, do a good job of setting up the rest of the series, giving you an introduction to key characters, and leads to the better movies in the franchise. For me, Star Wars is told like a loaf of bread. The end pieces (Episode I and Episode VI) are the weekest parts. The best Star Wars films are everything in the middle (Episodes II-V).
1597371416|3.0|I enjoyed this audiobook overall, but found the reader's voice a bit annoying.  I often found it difficult to focus on what it was that she was saying.  The other thing that I did not like was how many tracts were on a CD.  Each CD is divided into 100 tracks.  Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player.
B0011NVCO8|4.0|I liked this movie, it was a little on the long side and there were some things that just didnt make sense...I'm not sure I'll ever watch it again but its def worth having in your library.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|As a Xbox 360 HD DVD drive fanboy owner, Casino Royale was one of the few HD films I was envious for that was Blu Ray exclusive. After hearing that Sony pretty much bought off the majority of the movie studios and thus the HD format war was over, I gave in and bought the best BD player worth the money, a PS3. Casino Royale was my first BD film I played on my PS3 and boy was I happy with my purchase. I had seen Casino Royale on standard DVD and loved the movie, the only Bond film I really, really loved. It reminded me of what they did with Batman Begins, in other words start fresh with a more realistic and gritty feel. But don't get me wrong, all the good things that make a Bond film great are still there, beautiful, exotic locations with equally beautiful and exotic women. The image quality in BD looked stunning, especially during the tropical beach and jungle enviroments. I thought I would hate Daniel Craig as 007 but quite the contrary, he's the best Bond ever. I read somewhere that Craig might be this generation's Steve McQueen, I can totally see that. I am looking forward to the next Bond film.
B000QUEQBI|4.0|I really liked this movie, Mark seems to get better with each movie he does and that fact that..well I dont want to spoil it but it has a good ending. Packed with action and has decent replay value..Gotta love Hi Def
B000UJ48VI|5.0|As the theatrical trailer reminds us, making a movie of Lolita in the early 60s was a well-nigh impossible gesture. Nabokov's novel, with all its byzantine word games, centers on the ultimate taboo: Child  rape. It's a tribute to Nabokov's genius that his point-of-view character, chief protagonist Humbert  Humbert (the unnatural redundancy of the name suggests incest, among other things) can court our  sympathies with  any degree of success. He's a pathetic, cowardly monster who kidnaps and rapes his own stepdaughter and holds her hostage to his desires until she escapes from him. Yet his ardor  for the beloved 'nymphet,' with all its accompanying jealousy, possessiveness and the downright terror of her falling into the hands of teenage boys, says something  profound about the irrational  nature of love. When Lolita finally slips from his clutches, it's the body following the illusion Humbert has created; he never legitimately had her/owned her, but neither does any  lover, ultimately.    Stanley Kubrick's film of Lolita is not the novel, as the most helpful positive reviewer points out. It simply couldn't have been done at the time, but neither does Adrian  Lynne's  1998 adaptation do it justice (I  suspect that no  one, not even a latter-day Luis Bunuel, could make the \\"real\\" Lolita, with  all of its hall-of-mirrors splendor intact). But  considering the limitations involved, Kubrick's is a marvelous work. Using a sublime cast--Peter Sellers steals the show as Quilty, James Mason is wonderfully Humbertian, and Sue Lyons is a convincingly vulgar childish  enticement--and working from Nabokov's  own  script, Kubrick delicately cuts  the outline of monstrosity from symbolism, clues  and  cues to the actual evil at hand that range from the subtle to the hilariously overt (Lolita attends something called  Camp Climax; Humbert  refers to the Dairy Queen  as the Frigid Queen, with all the Freudian matter  that conveys). For all the  talk of Kubrick's formalism  he can bevery funny, and his film of Lolita has slapstick qualities to rival Buster Keaton, along  with  all the droll suggestions of naughtiness  indicated above. A very enjoyable film and one that bears repeated viewing.
B000EWBKK8|4.0|This is a phenominal movie.  I am a huge Cage fan so I picked it up without having seen the film before.  I was very happy with it.  Unfortunately it is JUST the movie on this disk and it is remeniscient of the early days of DVD where you only got the movie, then later you would be prompted to buy the special edition with special features.  It would have been nice to have had some special features on this disk, it really could have been an interesting bit of extra.<br /><br />Overall, a great purchase, especially if you don't care about special features.
B0000067L4|3.0|I picked this up because it was the last of the original four of Cream's albums, and was dissappointed. I loved the mixture of studio and live music on Wheels of Fire (my favorite), and so I thought this would be wholly worthwhile. To my dismay, I found that the live recordings were uninspired, boring, and unimaginative. The vocals aren't powerful and the jams don't go anywhere. That's where the live material differs from that of Wheels.  Also, the studio material was far from spectacular. Badge is very good, but the others are so-so. I got the version with Anyone for Tennis, and it's pretty good also; it's along the lines of Coffee Song and Wrapping Paper.  All in all, I have no clue as to the reason this album exists. The live material is so much worse than that of Wheels (which I find outstanding) and the studio songs should be outtakes for Wheels at best (whether or not they were recorded in this era). Badge is the only exception. I gave this three stars because it's still Cream, but compared to their other releases, it deserves a two at best. If you don't have Fresh Cream, Disraeli Gears, and/or Wheels of Fire, get those first. If you have all three, you'll probably get this anyway, and you'll see what I mean...

B000GTJT16|4.0|Sleepy Hollow has been my 2nd all time favorite move since its release.  I have always wanted the DVD and finally purchased it a couple weeks ago.  However, I just learned as of today that HD DVD's do not play in regular dvd players.  All these years I have watched movies and I never knew this.  Just wanted to give those who are interested in buying it a heads up! However, I did order a regular disc today so I will be able to enjoy it in a few days!!
B000I0RNV6|1.0|I have attempted to watch this twice. In each case the disc gets \\"hung up/caught\\" somewhere in the middle of the viewing and won't move on. I don't know quite how to describe it. I have watched other movies just to be sure it wasn't my DVD player.  Sorry

B00132D808|1.0|While I love Panic's music a great deal, I found this CD to be an extreme disappointment. The music is such a departure from their first CD that I find it difficult to connect the two. The fun, spunky music that had you tapping your feet and jamming in the car is now slow, and in my opinion, boring. You guys are in your 20's, not your 60's!  I feel like I'm going back in time to some Beatles music that my grandparents would listen to. I'm glad other bands (The Academy Is, Cute is What We Aim For) are keeping this type of music alive. Panic, what happened?
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|For me this was a pretty good movie but compared to the first two I took off one star.<br /><br />I think it pushed the limits of believability to a very high level.<br /><br />Jason somehow breaks into CIA headquarters and calls the CIA guy before opening the safe.  This puts everyone on his trail which was a completely unnecessary risk.  Then again maybe he did this on purpose and I missed something who knows.<br /><br />Everything was for me just a little bit too unbelievable and went too perfectly.  I guess with any great movie concept it gets harder to come up with new ideas with the sequels.<br /><br />Still we learn a lot about Jason and the important choice he made.  Three movies later he is finally beginning to break free of the evil force that he sold his soul to at the beginning.<br /><br />In part one Jason used a pen as a weapon.  Now in part three he uses a book.<br /><br />What is this telling us ?<br /><br />It's a secret message.<br /><br />People shouldn't write evil things or read evil books.  It's very dangerous.<br /><br />These are scary movies because those security agencies like the CIA and KGB really exist.  If they really want to kill someone Jason Bourne won't be able to save them.<br /><br />They probably really have programs like this but we will never find out.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00009N80R Clint Eastwood Collection: Where Eagles Dare]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000M53GNG Thunderball]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TBYA06 The Truth About The Philadelphia Experiment]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00079HZT8 Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000A6T1J0 Hogan's Heroes - The Complete 2nd Season]]
0786838655|5.0|Fabulous Greek Mythology Reading! While I realize my home schooled 11 year old may be a rarity in the speed from which he reads. These books by Rick Riordan have inspired within our son the keen interest in Greek Mythology and he will just be entering into 5th grade (by public school standards) this fall!  Now this is the same kid who read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7) in less than 3 days!  While his interests are in fantasy these mythology books by Rick Riordan have ventured him out into a new realm of wanting to know all about Greek Mythology and have made my work harder as I now need to find teachings on the subject for the classroom.  Obviously Rick Riordan knows how to entice our young readers into learning and for that he gets HIGH PRAISE from this teacher/mom!  And he can't publish the books fast enough for our avid reader!
0452289963|5.0|This book is fabulous!  It truly is life altering.  If everyone that reads this book applies just a few of the principles offered we would absolutely change the world.  Civilizations may become civil.
0375424474|3.0|If you have an interest in evolution and genetics, this is a book I would recommend. I would probably rate this as three and a half stars rather than three. I found it quite absorbing and easy to read.    The author looks at how our various body parts evolved. We also learn some fine points of paleontology, biology and genetics. It probably isn't a book for the Intelligent Design adherent or creationist but only because it is decidely about evolution; religion doesn't enter into it.    I was led to this book after acquiring a thirst for human evolution upon reading Bill Bryson's \\"[[ASIN:B0011SSUSE A Short History of Nearly Everything: Special Illustrated Edition]]\\" I found I was constantly comparing it to Bryson's book. Bryson wins hands down in the literary stakes: he is a much more entertaining writer. Shubin appears to attempt to match Bryson's wit at times without really succeeding. However, the biggest distinction is that Shubin is an expert in his field so can write from his own vast knowledge and experience in human biology and paleontology. At the end of the book is an excellent 'bibliography' that invites the reader to pursue further research.    Shubin doesn't dig too deep into the subject and I believe has presented the material in a comprehensive way without being overwhelming or boring. I don't think you will put this book down at the end feeling disappointed. Like me, you are likely to want to learn more.
B00005JLFC|2.0|YENTL is a classic example of Star Ego run amok.  The quirky and fine piece of literature from which it is taken, I.B. Singer's short story, \\"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\\", is the story of a transgendered young woman from a shtetl in Eastern Europe, who, at the end of the story, chooses to live the rest of her life in the male persona of Anshel.    Singer himself was furious at what Streisand did to his story and wrote a stinging rebuke to her in the New York TIMES when the film premiered, ending by congratulating Streisand on turning it into such a terrific vehicle for herself.    The film has more holes than a wedge of Swiss cheese, but no matter, Streisand appears in just about every single frame, and despite the fact that her co-star, Mandy Patinkin, was possessed of a beautiful dark tenor voice and could sing as well as she, no one, but NO ONE, in here gets to sing a note but Streisand (unless you count Amy Irving humming quietly to herself as she sews by the fireside).  I guess Streisand couldn't bear the thought of competition for two minutes of the audience's time.  Or, God forbid, Patinkin winning praise for more nuanced, less over the top delivery than she.    In Streisand's mangling of Singer's original work, Yentl is actually a heterosexual girl who is merely an Oppressed Early Feminist.  She hates housework and cooking and every other aspect of the female role to which Orthodox shtetl women were constrained in the early 20th century.  However, as her widowed rabbi-father's only child, she is stuck with all of it. Her father rewards Yentl by indulging her thirst for learning and teaching her Torah, after dark, when the shutters are closed and the neighbors can't see.  When her father dies, Yentl sees her chance to escape her inevitable fate of marriage, child-bearing, housework, and, without her father, no Torah study.  She cuts off her hair, dons male clothing, and runs away, adopting the name of her dead brother, \\"Anshel\\".    In classic Hollywood fashion, wefirst see Yentl hacking awkwardly at her long locks with a big scissor, and next see her with a perfect, beautifully textured and layered haircut that could have come straight out of a fashionable Fifth Avenue salon.  Streisand's slight stature, delicate hands, smooth throat, light voice, and powder-fresh complexion (she always did have nice skin) wouldn't have fooled a blind man, but apparently she fools everyone else in this rigidly gender-separated world.    Almost immediately, Yentl/Anshel meets up with and is taken under the wing of Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin), the prize student in the yeshiva of a small town.  Avigdor gets Yentl/Anshel into the yeshiva where, after an interview with the Rabbi, s/he is accepted as a student.  Y/A's dream is fulfilled: she can now study Torah from dawn till dark with the other boys.    There's just one catch: she's fallen madly in love with the tall, handsome, and considerably more adult Avigdor, who seems to be about ten years older than every other boy in the yeshiva.  The moment of revelation occurs at a lakeside where the yeshiva boys are swimming together.  Naturally, Y/A refuses to join them, since she would have to disrobe.  Avigdor comes out of the lake and, stark naked and gleaming with moisture, stands in front of Y/A with his genitalia about a foot from Y/A's face as he tries to persuade Y/A to go swimming.  The idea that any Orthodox man would have behaved so immodestly even before another man is ludicrous (in fact, I can't think of ANY men of my acquaintence who would have done so), but artistic verisimilitude never interferes with Streisand's heavy-handed absurdities.  Y/A runs back to her room in the boarding house, overcome with lust for the robust Avigdor.    Alas, Avigdor is engaged to Hadass (Amy Irving), the only daughter of the very well off Reb Vishkauer.  Hadass is everything a well brought up young Orthodox girl should be, and everything Yentl was not and never will be.  Hadass is adorably pretty and feminine, already a good cook, innocent, demure, non-confrontational, and uninterested in anything except pleasing Avigdor, marrying Avigdor, keeping Avigdor's home, making Avigdor a perfect wife, and bearing Avigdor's sons.  And Avigdor can't wait to marry Hadass, because she embodies his absolute ideal of a wife, for exactly those reasons.    Having seen Y/A run away from home rather than face a lifetime of exactly these wifely duties, we are now asked to sympathize with her/his envious resentment of how effortlessly Hadass inhabits this role, and the love it garners her.  \\"No wonder he loves her/What else could he do?/If I were a man, I would, too.\\"  This song hovers around the question of whether Y/A is jealous of Hadass for attaching Avigdor, or Avigdor for attaching Hadass, which would at least have been more in line with the dilemma faced by the Y/A of Singer's original story - it is Hadass whom the original Y/A longs for, not Avigdor.    Another hole in the story is that we never, at any time, figure out how Y/A and Avigdor pay for their rooms at the boarding house or even their food on the six nights a week that they don't eat at the Vishkauer's.  They don't appear to earn a kopek between them with which to feed and keep themselves.  Avigdor looks about 30 years old and does nothing but go to yeshiva to study every day.    And then, suddenly, Hadass's father finds out that Avigdor's younger brother committed suicide, and breaks off his daughter's engagement (suicide apparently invites the attention of the Evil Eye - a quaint euphemism for fear of passing on Bad Blood).  The heartbroken Hadass is inconsolable, as is Avigdor - until he hits on the brilliant idea that Y/A should marry Hadass (a rapid marriage is customary to \\"save face\\" after a broken engagement and old men from distant towns are already parading in and out of Reb Vishkauer's study).  Y/A and he are, Avigdor argues, already like brothers, and It Is Written that when a man's brother dies (and as far as Hadass goes, Avigdor might as well be dead) that man is obligated to marry his brother's wife (it probably happened once in Abraham's time and never again).  Y/A, naturally, at first refuses, but when Avigdor threatens to leave town rather than see Hadass married to anyone else, the putatitve \\"Anshel\\" caves in.  Hadass's parents are more than willing, as \\"Anshel\\" is, next to Avigdor, the best student in the yeshiva.    The fact that \\"Anshel\\" looks about 14, has cheeks as dewey as Hadass's own, no Adams' apple, has a voice that apparently hasn't broken yet, and no trade or visible means of support, doesn't seem to phase the parents.  The marriage takes place, and Y/A handles the wedding night by getting the bride tipsy and spilling wine on the sheets so the elders will think the marriage has been consummated.  Y/A handles the bride's bewilderment at not yet being deflowered day after day, by telling Hadass that as she is obviously still in love with Avigdor, it would be wrong to Do It until Hadass gets over him.  Remarkably, the uneasy Hadass never confides in her mother about this ongoing non-consummation, as any other bride would have, especially given that Hadass and \\"Anshel\\" are living with the Vishkauers.    Hadass quickly loses patience with this scenario and forces the issue. For one thing, she is rather getting to like the undemanding \\"Anshel\\", and for another, she knows that her primary duty, above all others, is to bear sons, and she won't be able to if they go on as they are.  She wants to be a full wife.  Y/A realizes that the deception can't go on, and s/he plans a trip out of town with Avigdor.  As soon as they are safely inside an inn, Y/A tells Avigdor her real name and who she is.  When Avigdor refuses to believe her, Y/A opens her shirt and shows him her bosom.    Avidgor goes into a titanic rage, screaming at poor Yentl that she has spit on the Torah and spit on Hadass, and only calming down when it penetrates his eardrums that Yentl did it because she loved him and couldn't bear to part with him.  Suddenly he sees the fresh cheeks, smooth neck, pretty hair, and delicate hands that we've all been staring at for two hours, wondering how people could be so stupid.  Within a few minutes, Avigdor is talking about going away somewhere where no one knows them, where they'll get married and start life over again.  Now that he knows she's a woman, Avigdor doesn't even bother to discuss the matter with Yentl, he turns into Man the Decider.  When Yentl reminds him that she doesn't want just to darn his socks, Avidgor grudgingly says, all right, she can go on studying - after dark, when the shutters are closed and the neighbors can't see.  Yentl realizes then that much as she loves Avigdor, Hadass is, after all, the woman he belongs with.  She gives Avigdor two letters, one for the rabbi stating that the marriage was never consummated, and one for Hadass explaining the full truth.  Yentl tells Avigdor that she doesn't think Hadass will listen to her parents any more, and to go home and marry her.    Avigdor takes Yentl's advice.  A few months later, we see that Avigdor and Hadass are finally and happily married, and reading a letter from Yentl telling them that she is going someplace, \\"Where I hear things are different.\\"  The \\"someplace\\", of course, is America, and perhaps it escaped scriptwriter Streisand's notice that the early 20th century Orthodox community in America would no more have welcomed Yentl the Yeshiva Girl than her shtetl in Poland did - in fact, it wouldn't welcome her NOW.  As far as Orthodox Judaism was and is concerned, things weren't different then and still aren't.  It would be at least another half-century before the rise of Reform Judaism made possible the admittance of women to Torah and rabbinical studies.  One could only imagine poor Yentl's disappointment when she arrives on the Lower East Side after her long journey.  Now, who could have told the beknighted Yentl that in America girls could to to yeshiva and study Torah?!      At the end of the movie we see Yentl on an immigrant ship bound for America, striding from one end of it to the other while every other other human being on that ship is forced to remain completely motionless and silent as Yentl bawls her signature song, \\"Papa can you see/hear me!?\\" at the tops of her lungs.    For sheer magnitude of oversentimentalized, overblown, tasteless, maudlin, nonsense this film cannot be beat. As scriptwriter, producer, director, and star, the blame for this offensive piece of claptrap belongs squarely on Streisand's mighty shoulders.    For the record, the rest of the cast do heroically well, given that they are almost always in solely reactive mode.  Amy Irving is charming as the demure Hadass; Patinkin is manly and stalwart as the passionate Avigdor; the supporting cast of friends, parents, tailors, are all fine.  As mentioned above, despite the fact that Patinkin had a terrific voice (he made his name in the original \\"Evita\\" on Broadway and his rendition of \\"Younger than Springtime\\" in the version of \\"South Pacific\\" that he recorded in the 1980s is just gorgeous), this is a one-voice \\"musical\\".    The film won an Academy Award for Best Score, and the sobbing, shmaltzed-up bathos of Michel Legrand's and Marilyn and Alan Bergman's music suits the tawdry essence of the film perfectly.  Audiences adored it (just take a look at all those gushing reviews below) for all the reasons I loathed it: the distortion of Singer's original story/play, its maudlin sentimentality, its pseudo-feminist posturing, its utter inability to make sense even within its own conceit, and, most of all, its manifestly sole reason for existing at all: to serve as a vehicle for the monstrous, out-of-control, legendary ego of Barbra  Streisand, at the expense of any semblance of artistic taste or integrity.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Thanks to Spielberg, Frankel and Hanks for bringing to life an enduring story of bravery, heroism and brotherhood!  The series is a first rate production from casting, acting, directing, sets, even packaging. It also has the power to teach by way of the 'extras', interviews, maps.  A wonderful tribute to the greatest generation!
0452286751|5.0|My top 10 favorite books of all time... once you start, you can't put it down.  It took me about 3 days to read it and there were times when I spent an hour just thinking about one paragraph... very eloquently written.  It's one of those HAVE TO read books in your lifetime.  Highly recommended!
B00000I41J|4.0|I ordered the RVG Remaster without realizing I had the previous edition (remastered by Ron McMaster) in my collection.  An A-B comparison reveals that the previous edition has depth, subtlety, dynamic nuance, with the opening rhythmic figure by Hank Jones followed by the sustained pianissimo whole notes of Cannonball and Miles establishing an inviting mystique, then building on this mood right up to the first chorus of what is probably the most celebrated recorded version of \\"Autumn Leaves\\" in jazz.  The RVG remaster starts with \\"hot\\" mics on the piano, then on both horns, with little difference in dynamic extremes.  In fact, dynamics, ensemble textures, and stereo separation become meaningless as Rudy seems intent simply on making whatever instrument is temporarily featured as loud as possible.  Having been spoiled by the previous edition, not to mention Miles' sound on his classic Columbia sessions, I can't stay with the RVG remaster, though admittedly some listeners attracted to the 1950s hard bop Blue Note sound may react differently.<br /><br />The bonus track on the previous edition is titled \\"Alison's Uncle\\"; on the new edition, it's \\"Bangoon.\\"<br /><br />I have hundreds of Van Gelder-engineered sessions past and present and have yet to hear a remaster that is a dramatic improvement (in the case of \\"Somethin' Else\\" the opposite seems true).  Apparently Blue Note had second thoughts about the project and has passed it on to Concord, though the majors are increasingly pushing downloaded tracks and the bigger profit margins they bring (no packaging costs, no need to pay writers for liner notes).  The RVG reissues were at least welcome for assuring the continued circulation of vital music and for the updated, frequently informative and insightful liner notes.  Unfortunately, we've reached yet another stage in the digital revolution.  It's exceedingly rare now to find domestic jazz releases, whether new or reissues, of any sort.  Like other collectors, I've had to look to Spain, Japan, Italy, Germany, Holland, etc. for reissues (and first-time releases) of historically significant, indispensable American music.  (I'm left to wonder if Ken Burns' absorbing PBS series on jazz merely provoked complacency or, worse, a backlash against the music.)Japan, Italy, Germany, Holland, etc. for reissues (and first-time releases) of historically significant, indispensable American music.

032147404X|5.0|So, after reading a few books, it was amazingly refreshing to read a book, JUST FOR digital photography.  I noticed int he corner it says it works well for P&S cameras as well, and I have to question that.  There is a lot of the concepts in the book that carry over, but not very well.      While I am currently using a P&S, I plan to rectify THAT situation in the coming month, so I am reading this book with the future in mind.      I really like how he explains concepts simply, like a buddy telling you how to do something, instead of having a book that tells you WHY... he just tells you WHAT.  (with a few whys tossed in).  I think this is a GREAT way for the absolute newbie to get their feet wet.  It also has a LOT of wonderful tips for amatures and above.      I think the BIGGEST weakness, is how much Photoshop is shown throughout the book.  I am an elements user, and really felt left out, except for a few spots.  I don't know that his book is \\"high end\\" enough, to be discussing a $650 program, that he seems to base most things on.  I think a heavier emphasis on elements would have been better.    I want to point out, overall, this book IS a 5... but I do have a few issues with it... I don't believe any are worth knocking the book down to a 4.
B00006I53S|5.0|Super price and super fast shipping. Well packaged. Also the Canon Lens is excellent in quality. The image stabilizer is incredible, as well as the zoom ability. Note: w/ the 28-135mm macro and short distance picture taking is limited (slightly) but the zoom and quality of images from this lens, by far, make up for it!    very pleased.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Wow, this is an outstanding DVD.  The extras were wonderful, the movie itself was extremely well done. I could have done without a lot of the puppet/mask work in the movie, but the songs were incredibly well done, the choreography was outstanding, the acting top-notch. Every single song gave me goosebumps, or tears.  I knew these songs, who doesn't? but they were done in such a way that made me listen again, and say, wow, that is an amazing song. wow. just plain wow. The extras explained how they decided to do the music and it was fascinating. i LOVED it.
B00008RWB3|5.0|This is a repost of my 1999 review that became anonymous when I changed email addresses.    There are some very good descriptions of Infinite Jest on this page. It fills my heart to know that there are writers willing to write huge tomes, and readers willing to read them. That said...IJ is a postmodern, almost post-postmodern (to use Wallace's own joke) joy/despair ride of literary strength and will seldom seen anymore (if you think reading it is a challenge, imagine writing it!) with a bit of dalliance and self-indulgence that ultimately fit in with the hilarity. Although absolutely hilarious in some places (one mere description of a handshake still makes me giggle) it is a testament to sadness, obssession, addiction, and even though some characters seem to recover, I think Walace's ultimate point is that there's no recovering from being human. Humanity carries with it sadness for the sake of sadness sometimes, and addiction to addiction. Everyone in the book (like everyone in life) is seeking happiness even when they can't define it for themselves, don't recognize it, and can think they're happy when they're not, or worse, force themselves into lying to themselves about their true sadness. Several characters come to the conlcusion stated by one minor, weepy character that we all come to eventually, \\"nothing is true.\\" The question to be asked of Infinite Jest, and the core of its genius in formal construction and philosophical conclusion is not \\"how does it end?\\" but \\"how does it begin?\\"
B00008DDSC|4.0|I never thought I'd like this movie by the previews when if first came out.  I happened to catch it on TV about a year ago and was hooked.  It's different from your typical love story but it's a love story nonetheless.  It's unusual and not for everyong but it shows you that there is a love out there for everyone, you just have to find it.  Not for the younger set though so be cautious.
B000001BZT|5.0|Right up there with other Steve Earle CDs. Would recommend to anyone who remotely likes his music!
B00132D808|5.0|So I must admit, I have been a fan of panic since right around when they released their first album...three years ago. So i was expecting this album to be quite different. And of course, I've been a fan for three years, so obviously I'm going to have a bias towards them. I mean seriously, this band can do no wrong in my eyes. But on with the review.<br /><br />I've been waiting verrrry patiently since the announcement of the release date to listen to these songs. I hadn't heard anything but obviously the single \\"Nine in the Afternoon,\\" (because its INESCAPABLE! ITS EVERYWHERE.) and just a live version of \\"When the Day Met the Night.\\" So i wasn't really sure to expect. But ever since I bought the album around 4 this afternoon, its been playing on a loop, and it's now 9:30 at night. So needless to say... I love it.. a lot. I must admit it's very different! Not a synth to be heard, but quite the abundance of a clean little brass band.<br /><br />And the album WAS recorded at Abbey Road. And I will admit I can hear the Beatle's vibe in the songs. But they are themselves and this is a totally different feel. And i love it. I don't feel like I'm trapped in a Chuck Palahniuk novel, and it's just a really happy sound.<br /><br />Go out and buy Pretty.Odd. if you've been a long time panic fan, or you just want an album with good lyrics, new melodies, and happy summery feels.

B000MRA5EM|5.0|\\"Deep Sea\\" is a wonderful look at the one world that Man has no domain. As intelligent and resourceful as we are, we still cannot plumb the depths with the ease that the Ocean's creatures can. Instead, we plunder and pollute this wonderous world that we cannot conquer.    This film regretfully, may stand, like others that display the world's beautiful places, as the only record of what it was like before we destroyed it. There are many reviews that are critical of the the narration, or the Director. This film is not about them. \\"Deep Sea\\" gives us a look at some of the Ocean's most unique creatures, and how they, more than we, have areas where predator and prey call a truce, and do things for one another for the betterment of both species! It also brings to the screen creatures that many may not have seen before (the Sunfish comes to mind, because I, myself had never seen one).  \\"Deep Sea\\" is a feast for the eyes, as there is no trace of our intrusion (yet). Our children must see this film, and others like it, so that maybe, one day, they will be more responsible in preserving something that has fed, clothed and provided many things in our present lives, for our benefit.
B00104W8T6|4.0|After seeing this movie I just had to have the sound track. The only disapointment I had was due to my own lack of knowlage. The song I liked the best was not recorded in it's entirity, because, it was not used in the movie in it's entirity. This is a fun CD with catchy songs.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|An exquisite film with splendid photography, a beautiful and haunting score, and a stupendous cast. Edward Norton delivered a veritably mesrmerizing and unforgettable performance, Paul Giamatti was equally compelling, and Rufus Sewell, in the shoes of the bad guy, was outstanding. Even though the story is told in such a way that you don't know what really happened till the very end, it is the kind of film you'd want to see more than once, knowledge of its ending notwithstanding.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are naturals in this film and they feed off of each other nicely. You get to really like them by the ending and that makes the ending even more shocking. Great direction by Fincher who brought us such films as Fight Club and Zodiac. Definitley a must see for all movie fans!!
B00005MP58|5.0|I have read the book and seen this mini series adaptation. I am usually pretty critical about movies that are made of books but this version of Pride and Prejudice was done well. I highly recommend it. Colin Firth is the best Mr. Darcy, I really couldn't see any other actor playing him. The actress who plays Mrs. Bennet was excellent as well.
0792164903|5.0|I saw this film in the theatre when it was released in the late nineties and I was blown away. Not since the first Batman does a film rely so heavily on atmosphere and actually deliver that atmosphere with tact and quality. Taking the journey to sleepy hollow is like traveling through a dream. All of the performances are great but Johnny Depp gives one of the best of his career as the constable/scientist Icahbod Crane. Ricci is also convincing as the lovely Katrina Van Tassel. Some great scares and great action await you in Sleepy Hollow so snuggle up and enjoy the supernatural thrill ride!!
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Loved the movie, love the album. Not happy that it's missing a few songs though, mainly 'I Want You' from the enlistment office scene. Having that ONE song on the album would've earned this purchase 5 stars.

B000ZBEOF6|5.0|what a refreshing, emotionally moving experience.  I was one of those old hippies who lived through the times and this movie was a wonderful flashback of so many experiences.  the music is new and crisp.  the interweaving of the story with the music is just too good.  if you like the depth of the old Beatle's music and the passion of the 60's, this film is for you.

0385341067|4.0|'Mister Pip' is a well thought-out and sympathetically-written story about a young girl, Matilda, caught up in civil war on the South Pacific tropical island where she has lived all her life.     War threatens the everyday lives of people from Matilda's village. The young men have already gone off to war, and the villagers live under constant threat of attack and other war atrocities. There is one white man left, Mr. Watts, who has been married to villager Grace for some years. Grace, however, doesn't seem to be quite of right mind and she and Mr. Watts have been mostly ignored or ostracised by the rest of the village. They live in a big house on the village outskirts and lead quite separate lives. As the war progresses Mr. Watts soon takes on the responsibility of Teacher at the little one-room school, using as his textbook Dickens's 'Great Expectations'. He reads the book aloud to the children, until the story takes on meaning and becomes something of an obsession, especially to Matilda, and Mr. Pip becomes a very real character in this war-torn community.     The book is lyrically written, often hinting at meaning rather than overtly stating it, with a simplicity that suits the story being told. Touching and heartbreaking; but I have given 4 stars instead of 5 as I didn't quite warm to the characters as much as I wanted to, especially Matilda and Mr. Watts. Winner of the 2007 Comonwealth Writers' Prize and shortlisted for the 2007 Man Booker, the book seems sure to become a modern classic and I wouldn't be surprised to see it one day as a school text. Reminiscent of, although quite different from, William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies'.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I have watched this DVD at least three times and see new stuff each time.  Filming is great and the story line is superb. Finally there is closure.  I hope that every SG-1 fan buys a copy of this so they will make more.  I know that they are coming out with SG-1 Continuum but haven't set a release date for it yet.  I only wish they would put it in Blue Ray format.

B000HEVZ6W|5.0|I loved Gattaca from the day I first saw in theaters.  I was very excited to see it's release announced for blu-ray, and now am happy to say that this blu-ray release is truly an upgrade.  If you've already bought this on DVD, it's worth buying again on blu-ray.    Video quality is top notch in every single scene.  This movie has a subtle color palate that casts a warm orange hue in day scenes, and a cool blue hue in darker shots.  Some people may complain that this type of cinematography is overly processed, but regardless of what your feelingss are on the look of the film, you can't argue with this blu-rays amazing image quality.  I can't stress this enough, the movie just looks perfect.    Special features are as bad as they were on the DVD release, including a handful of scenes and a brief documentary.  The documentary is rather interesting, although most of the material discussed is common knowledge by now.  Sadly the bonus content didn't get the HD treatment, understandable since the documentary was shot on video and the deleted scenes never made it past dailies.  Oh yeah, watching the deleted scenes is painful, so just skip those ... trust me.    What else is there to say, it's perfect.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|Dear god....... How was this film allowed to be made?  Is therea theme?  A point, perhaps?  Noooooooooo.... 9/10ths of this excrement is pseudo-intelligent dialogue (Quentin's writings BLEED through the actresses voices. That's all I could hear, was Quentin Taratino talking through them).  The film's contents have very little to do with the title (except for Kurt Russell's brief explanation of his deathmobile, which we rarely see).  Basically, it's over 110 minutes of listening to the girls exchange their soap-operaish mediocre conversation.  This even falls short of B-movie status.  I beg you to save your time and money!!
0783230079|4.0|This is one of those thought provoking movies.  Everyone faces a crossroads in his or her lives that is a turning point.  Four people at those crossroads die prematurely before they are able to make a decision, and are fated to roam the earth until they resolve unfinished business.

B0009OL876|5.0|This tremendously entertaining spy film from director Alfred Hitchcock's British period set the standard for all man-on-the-run films. Based on John Buchan's novel of an innocent Canadian tourist in Britain thrust unexpectedly into the world of spies, it's hard to find a better one than this.<br /><br />Robert Donat is the Canadian, Richard Hanney, who gets more than he's bargained for when a woman named Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim) in fear for her life is killed in his flat after revealing to Hanney that she is a Secret Agent protecting the secrets of her country from a dangerous network of spies known only as the 39 Steps.<br /><br />With a murder charge hanging over his head he must heed her words and make his way to Scotland and get to the bottom of the 39 Steps in order to clear his name. But when a misguided guess leads him right into the hands of the dangerous head of the network, Professor Gordon (Godfrey Tearle), the hunter now becomes the hunted.<br /><br />He is helped along the way by a few kind souls who believe in his innocence. Peggy Ashcroft is memorable as a lonely farmer's wife who risks everything to help him escape. A kiss given by Hanney for her kindness is a poignant moment in a film both enjoyable and exciting. When he and a much more reluctant young woman named Pamela (Madeleine Carroll) are hancuffed together there is a shift in the film's tone as romance enters into the story.<br /><br />The classy Carroll was a perfect match for Donat and the back and forth between the two is still enjoyable today. Sneaking off into the night while he is sleeping she overhears the men after him and comes back to help him, finally believing his colorful story of murder and spies. A tune stuck in Hanney's head will finally lead him to the \\"Memory Man\\" and a grand finale.<br /><br />This is most definitely a film classic. Another good screenplay from Charles Bennet and good work from photographer Bernard Knowles, who always made the most of the sometimes meager budgets given he and Hitchcock in Britain, enhance a story with both tension and a dash of romance. Other than the Criterion Collection DVD, prints are less than grandiose but still watchable. A must see film.ck in Britain, enhance a story with both tension and a dash of romance.

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I didn't catch this movie when it was in the theaters but have meant to see it for a long time.  I finally did this past Easter season... Good Friday to be precise.     Those of the Roman Catholic faith would be familiar with the \\"sorrowful mysteries\\"...specifically the agony in the garden, scourging at the pillar, crowning with thorns, carrying of the cross and the crucifixion.  It's one thing to imagine them and yet another to witness them in gruesome detail - as presented in this movie.    My wife and I reflected on the movie afterward and she found it's graphic intensity to be a bit much.  It was hard to watch.  That's what I found particulary poignant.  Witnessing it in gorey detail on screen is one thing.  Imagine actually being there for real.  You can see why St. Peter denied Christ three times... wouldn't you?    Some non-Catholics don't understand the special role Mary has in our faith.  Maybe it's lost on some but to me, her very significance in the eyes of God, and the Catholic tradition is underscored in this movie.      In any event, if you've ever wondered what \\"scourging at the pillar\\" really means or shrugged off the significance of Jesus's life, death and resurrection, this movie will provide some prospective.    I'd put it in the same category as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  Not a movie I'd care to watch over and over but one that should certainly be watched when the topic of reducing Veterans rights is presented.    This movie should be seen by those who struggle with their own crosses and need a booster shot in their faith.

This amazing polymath is incredibly well-informed, resourceful, and will lend an ear to various opinions on different issues without compromising his convictions based on his experience and research.  Most people have read his \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", but fewer people I know have read \\"Collapse\\" or \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\", both of which are highly informative for knowledge-thirsty readers like myself.  All of his books display an amazing breadth of knowledge and interest that it is hard to imagine that this guy used to be a physiologist.  Now he seems to have found his permanent niche in geography.<br /><br />Jared's resourcefulness and absorption for the subject of why past societies collapsed and his case against \\"environmental determinism\\" are laudable.  Many parts of the book read like they were written late at night, when the author is deep in analytical thoughts.  Some parts were extremely fluent and readable, for example, the chapter on Montana and the chapters on Hispaniola, New Guinea, Rwanda, and Japan.  You could curl up with these chapters, enjoying every paragraph.<br /><br />Other parts, however, read like a dry textbook, or seemed like inscribed from a lecture in his UCLA classroom.  The degree to which he enumerates reasons or factors (again and again) for societal collapses can be tiresome.  Or, in confronting our current environmental problems, he yet again reminds us of what transpired on Easter Island, Pitcairn Islands, Mayan and Anasazi societies, New Guinea, Greenland, Australia, etc.  You get the feeling that he is injecting his points right into your head.  Sometimes he tries to add a funny, if not geeky, remark that is unworthy of what should be a serious book in geography and history.  Chapters on  Norse settlements in Greenland and the white settlement of Australia were written at great lengths that could use some editing.<br /><br />Jared is a decent, but not an elegant, writer.  If I was going to read another comprehensive treatment of a similar subject, I would be more excited if it was written more succintly--and much more elegantly.  Perhaps he could take up the writing styles of Richard Dawkins, Thomas Friedman, Stanley Karnow, Stephen Ambrose, Pater Hopkirk, and Oliver Sacks, to name a few.  I give him credit nonetheless for writing  about an important subject that is relevant for modern-day societies.  With improved technology, globalization, and the availability of knowledge and understanding of which societies collapsed, including how and why, we have the choice not to repeat the hard lessons of history.I was going to read another comprehensive treatment of a similar subject, I would be more excited if it was written more succintly--and much more elegantly.

B000AJIF4E|2.0|These are great headphones for the money. This model is what a lot of pros use in recording studios and on movie locations, etc. But the earpads are totally faulty; they don't last very long and will just split open, which is really annoying. I had to replace them at least once a year, at additional cost and frustration. While you can buy replacement ear pads it is really a pain to install them. Sony simply needs to make more durable ear pads.<br /><br />These headphones look cool and provide fairly good isolation and good sound quality over the entire frequency range.<br /><br />For the price, these headphones are fairly comfortable (but not the most comfy headphones available), and they sound pretty good although I've certainly heard better. There is little to no sound leakage and they provide good isolation in a foldable design that looks cooler than most other headphones. I would say these are good entry-level monitoring headphones (for audio engineers, DJs, etc.). For music lovers, they are certainly usable but you won't get that 'tickle me ears' type of 'Wow!' feeling from the sound out of these like with some other higher end headphones.  Also, these aren't that comfortable especially for long periods of time because the ear pads are a bit too small and press my earlobes and since they are a closed design, my ears get hot and sweaty after a while of wearing them; not a good thing.<br /><br />I've moved on to other more comfy headphones and am in general a lot happier now although I didn't have any complaints with the sound out of these Sonys.
0316113506|4.0|John J. Ratey's book is important and a great addition to exercise science. But I was concerned by some insufficient stats in his research.  For example, I am very familiar with Naperville, Illinois, which he cites as the area in the U.S. where high school students academically fair as well or better than Asian students in Japan, China, India, etc.      Ratey attributes Naperville's academic excellence to exercise, and not to ethnicity.  However, Ratey does not indicate the ethnic distribution of students in Naperville.  I happen to know that Naperville is peppered with industries like Lucent Technologies, etc. that hire larger than average numbers of Asian employees in computer science, engineering, etc.  Naperville has a \\"huge\\" Asian population, and Ratey's book left me asking the begging question, \\"Is Ratey really comparing non-Asian American high schoolers to Asian high schoolers, or is he comparing American Asian high schoolers to native-born Asians?\\"      If the latter, then Naperville academic success amounts to very smart Asians in the U.S. outpacing less exercised Asians abroad.  In short, although exercise might be part of the reason for Naperville's academic success, another hidden reason might be the genetic argument that Asians simply score better in school.      Take a look at piano competitions, where it is a well known fact that Asians seem to dominate in recent years in competitions at all age groups (e.g. see Veda Kablinsky's comment on Asian piano superiority in the Van Cliburn Competition DVD, \\"In the Heart.\\")      Statistical omissions in Ratey's book as that mentioned aboved dampens it's convincing power.  Still, SPARK is a very good book and a valuable contribution to exercise science.  It should be purchased and read by all (on a treadmill)!
B000NVT0RU|3.0|I had big expectations for this movie according to the reviews received.  It was not a very powerful drama and as a war movie it was light in the action, I consider it slow moving and very talky.  As stating a case for returning the retirement benefits for the North African soldiers that fought for France in World War II that were suspended after the Independence of Morocco and Algiers from France it makes a point.<br /><br />It did not shock me the mistreatment and contempt the French authorities provided the North African soldiers as they were considered second class citizens of the colonies (the first class citizens were the French living in the colonies calles Pied Noir) and not even French nationals.  The North African soldiers were fighting for their oppressors in reality.  It is ironic that while Americans, Canadians, Brits, Poles and scores of people from different nationalities and continents were fighting for the freedom of France against Nazi Germany at the same time France was keeping a sizable number of their military keeping tha French colonies in North Africa and Asia in line. In this situation of double moral standards using people considered inferior as cannon fodder I believe was only expected.  The North African volunteers or Indigenes were not fighting for freedom, equality or brotherhood and specially not for France, each had motivations other than love of country as we can attest in the movie most went to Europe for plunder and payment, as mercenary soldiers.  It is well known fact that during the Italian campaign around Monte Cassino that by the way was won using French colonial troopers lead by General Juin where Brit, New Zealander, American, Pole and Indian troops had already failed the most hated soldiers by the Italian populace were the North African Goums because of their wide spread looting and raping.  Knowing these facts I am not very well inclined to feel weepy for these men.<br /><br />About the movie, the battle in Italy is well choreographed could have been more informative if we knew what battle we are talking about, is it the taking of the hills sorrounding the german positions at Monte Cassino ?  It is only referred as Italy 1944.  We see few germans a couple of machine gun nests and a mortar pit composing the obstacles the Indigenes have to surmount for their first victory, but was it an important victory, did it accomplish something in the full scope of the Italian campaign?  Maybe if we knew this was a mile stone or something important was accomplished we would be more inclined to support the claims of the North Africans for their justs pensions and benefits from the French Goverment.<br /><br />The battle in France is too talky, we are mostly presented with the injustices of white non coms being promoted ahead of the Ber Bers but we don't know if the Indigenes were really deserving of faster promotion, the French Sargeant Martinez and the Corporal are very good leaders of men as  they are presented and certainly demonstrated better judgement and authority than the Indigene coprporal so this case is not well presented.  We see an unconvincing romance between an Indigene soldier and a French lady and somehow we are led to believe that a one night stand is so significant in the life of the soldier called Mahmmoud that he is willing to desert his post and face the possibility of imprisonment and maybe death just to return to Marseilles and see her, I did not see enough chemistry or even emphaty between these characters to believe this.  As for the authorities trying to keep the Senegalese and North African soldiers away from the population by denying them home leave or even the privilege of getting uncensored letters was probably to be expected as I already said these were considered only cannon fodder and a little better than lootists and thiefs.  Yes, they were fighting for France but still were treated as dangerous foreigners.  But we have to consider the position of the French authorities that dreamed with returning France to its former glory retining its prestige and of course its colonies it was not in their best interest to provide equality for their colonial nationals.  Remember that many of these authorities have openly cooperated with the nazis during the occupation and the Vichy free government.<br /><br />The last battle in Alsace was the main point and we can see at last courage and determination in the North African soldiers as they defend a position against a german attack with greater numbers and equipment than thay had even when they have their French officers killed and rendered unfit to fight.  This is a nice small action a la Saving Private Ryan and probably saves the film from being boring and tedious.<br /><br />I believe that France should repay its veterans no matter the ancestry for their contributions during the war and that the pensions should be returned, maybe this is the whole point of the movie but could have been presented in a more convincing fashion.h returning France to its former glory retining its prestige and of course its colonies it was not in their best interest to provide equality for their colonial nationals.

0452289963|1.0|We read this for our book club, and were very disappointed in it.  We were really looking forward to it, but it doesn't seem to \\"awaken\\" anything.  We followed what Mr. Tolle is saying, but the repetitive nature of his writing made it difficult to get excited about surging forward.  Most of us wouldn't have read it in its entirety if it wasn't for the book club.  During the discussion, we all agreed that we shouldn't shoot the messenger when the message is a good one.  However, it was unanimous that his writing style was pompous and difficult to engage with.  He turned a lot of us off when he said that if you didn't get it, you weren't ready for it, i.e. smart enough or enlightened enough.  Given the level of education and professional achievement in our book club (engineers, lawyers, doctors, published author, business owners and professors), we didn't think that his book was \\"above\\" our ability.  It was just poorly written.
B00132D808|4.0|The album starts out with a declaration of \\"You don't have to worry, because we're still the same band.\\" But it really should have started out with a phrase from song #5 That Green Gentleman:  \\"Things have changed for me and that's okay.\\"<br /><br />I admit, when I first put the CD in I was wondering what the.....?? Who are these guys and where is Panic! at the Disco? I skipped through the songs, trying to find anything that sounded remotely like \\"I Write Sins\\" or \\"But it's Better if You Do\\". Well, I didn't find anything and wasn't sure that I cared for the album.<br /><br />But after having listened to it a few more times, I have to say I am impressed. It's definitely not \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\", but it's good in its own right. I've seen a few reviews talk about how it's `cookie cutter pop' and `just like everything else on the radio'. This is COMPLETELY false. This album doesn't sound anything like the music on the radio, pop or otherwise. I am forced to listen to the local pop station at work all day, and I've never heard anything remotely like this album being played. It has a Beatles-esque feel to it, but it's definitely not a carbon copy of Sgt Peppers.<br /><br />The songs are pretty mellow, but many of them have a peppy beat that got me hooked. There are a few songs I don't care for, but that's to be expected. Most albums have a few songs that aren't as good as the rest. Namely #12, which seemed to come out of nowhere with a country sound to it, and #13, which I just didn't care for. #14 is okay, but a bit too blah for me. I much prefer the peppier upbeat songs like their first radio song `Nine in the Afternoon', or the catchy `Mad as Rabbits'. `Do You Know What I'm Seeing' is another favorite.<br /><br />All in all, the album didn't catch me at first listen, which probably had more to do with the fact that I was expecting another `A Fever You Can't Sweat Out', and this album is far from it. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Different is good, and I admire them for trying something new instead of making a carbon copy of their first album. I read that they wanted to do something different and they succeeded.<br /><br />On that note, I think they could alienate a good portion of their younger listeners, and those who were expecting and only want a carbon copy of their last album. I'm interested to see if they continue to make the music that they want to make, or if their next album ends up like their first. I for one like both albums, and can appreciate the band exploring different sounds.thing new instead of making a carbon copy of their first album.

Lots of action too and keeps your interest but it's a bit weaker in   plot and big budget effects than the first two movies.    Zombies in the desert..lots of it seems similar to a Romero film..  maybe Day of the Dead?  It's still fun but has all been seen before..

B000WMEAKC|4.0|Ryan Tedder is the hottest thing in the music world right now. Everything he seems to touch either turns to gold, or mush. Whether it's the current #1 \\"Bleeding Love,\\" Ashley Tisdale, or even Blake Lewis. And if that wasn't enough, his own band has been the phenomenon on the phenomenon MySpace. But due to all that success, Tedder still wasn't ready to put out an album for the band. But then came \\"Apologize\\" remixed by Timbaland, and even though they didn't have a big credit for the phenomenon, they took the cover of Rolling Stone, and became the biggest thing in music. Then they realized they didn't have an album out. The result, is the best pop/rock CD of the year, and certainly the surprise album of the year.<br /><br />The album starts off amazing with, \\"Say (All I Need)\\" which takes on an epic feel all its own, and immediately gets you drawn into the album. \\"Mercy\\" could be considered extremely radio-friendly, and standard pop/rock fare, but as a album song, not on radio, the song actually works quite well But if the song ever did cross the line, than love with the song would quickly sink.<br /><br />Their current phenomenon, \\"Stop and Stare\\" which seems like it's fixing to crack the top 10 of the carts, and for good reason. The song has a very nice structure, starting off slow, before building up to, and taking off at the chorus in an unexpectedly amazing effort, that could be the highlight of the CD.<br /><br />The original version of \\"Apologize\\" is next, which starts off with violins, and a soft piano, with a slow clapping in the background. The only thing really different between this and the remix is Timbaland. I personally don't care for this version, reminding me more of Fort Minor's \\"Remember the Name,\\" without the rap. This version is also somewhat less emotional, as it seems pretty straight-up.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Apathy\\" is also pretty straight-up, and the structure stays relatively the same throughout the song, without really ever taking off. \\"All Fall Down\\" continues the trend, and ends up seeming overdrawn and rather boring. \\"Tyrant\\" starts off good, starts to fall apart towards the end, as again, it's too drawn out. But it a shortened version could be good for rock radio.<br /><br />\\"Prodigal\\" could again be better on structure, and somewhere towards the beginning of the song, it takes some elements from, \\"Across the Universe,\\" which may sound strange, but it's there. \\"Won't Stop\\" gets the album back on its feet again with an upbeat, poppy tune that is again one of the highlights of the CD. \\"All We Are\\" hints at some country pop elements in its verses, but jumping to its chorus, which feels uneven, but still winds up good.<br /><br />\\"Someone to Save You\\" actually continues another bad trend of bad song titles that are again, overdrawn. The song would have been better if it was titled, 'Honesty'. But for the song itself, yet another highlight that is well-done from verses to chorus, to bridge, and back again. And at the last minutes of the song, it has with an amazing ending, that takes elements of The Beatles, The Afters, and mixes in themselves for good measure, making for an amazing song.<br /><br />\\"Come Home\\" is a piano driven track that is exactly what type of song as its amazingly accurate title says. An emotional song that some may criticize for being unoriginal, but it's still good with its rather impressive chorus. And for the 13th track, we have the song that started the phenomenon, the remixed version of, \\"Apologize.\\" Simply put, no apologies needed with this song.<br /><br />Overall, a great debut, and probably the best thing to come out of MySpace. An impressive band that is still searching for their sound, which makes for many a hit, but just as many a miss. The best pop/rock album of 2007, and I'll be looking forward for the follow-up album, and the continued success of OneRepublic.<br /><br />But wait! That's not all! If this review wasn't long enough, there's bonus tracks that you'll find if you get the album from venues such as Target. I imagine you could also find them on their MySpace also. Since there's so many, here's the best of them.<br /><br />Dreaming Out Loud: Surprisingly, the title track isn't part of the actual album, but still a very good song that has more of a darker tone in its verses, before breaking into a rather impressive chorus that doesn't fail to impress, before going back to its verses that don't seem to fit the song.<br /><br />Hearing Voices: Another impressive track that is actually better than most of the songs on the actual album. The verses are great, and the chorus is soft but powerful, making for a great listen overall. And again, this song has a great structure.find them on their MySpace also.

That evening he had read half the book already and the next day when I picked him up from school I think he had 20 pages left.  He can't wait to read the 3rd book.  I would definatly recommend this to any child boy or girl.    Oh yeah my son is 9.  But I think all kids in elementary school would enjoy this book.

B000XA5K48|5.0|Shoot 'Em Up is a new to DVD release that absolutely blew my mind!  This was truly the best action film I have seen in years and is what the movie Crank wanted to be. Clive Owen was absolutely genius!  His character was awesome!  Paul Giamatti is a freakin' GOD!  There is nothing bad to say about this film. It's just straight forward bloody action, filled with just enough T&A and one liners that will have you rolling on the floor.  This will be enjoyed by anyone with a penis.  It doesn't matter what age you are, this film just rocks from beginning to end.  I'm not even going to get into the plot or any of that, because it's not even that important.  Just go buy this one!

The book chronicles Herr's many in-the-line-of-fire experiences there, as well as his conversations with American soldiers.<br /><br />At first, it appears that Herr is not writing chronologically, but jumping around with little rhyme or reason. Eventually, though, it becomes clear that things are relatively chronological. From there, the book settles into something of a pattern whereby Herr chats with combat-tested young grunts, does some drugs, listens to some rock music and quotes some song lyrics. This repeats, countless times, until the end of the book.<br /><br />One of the most excellent things Herr has done here is capture the dehumanizing, personality- and behavior-changing aspects of war. Many of the soldiers Herr talked with had developed eccentricities or mental illness from their experiences. The overall effect is that the reader is left with a profound sense of the many crazy things that people did in Vietnam.<br /><br />Dispatches is a piece of New Journalism, which was en vogue in the 1960s and 1970s. In this style, people write nonfiction using devices from literary fiction, including using scenes rather than historical narrative and using conversational dialogue. Herr does this and more, writing in a \\"cool\\", scattered, borderline incoherent style.<br /><br />Herr was either not well-acquainted with the semicolon, or he eschewed its use in an attempt to strike another blow for New Journalism. He often strung complete and independent sentences together with commas, sometimes three and four at a time. Somewhat distracting also is Herr's constant use of the word \\"spade\\" to describe black people, which is at the very least mildly derogatory, and at worst overtly racist.<br /><br />It is rather obvious to draw the parallel between Herr's writing style and the nature of the Vietnam War: both were disorganized, scattered, and lacking a coherent flow. On the one hand, this purposeful stylistic selection on Herr's part helps to underscore to the reader what Vietnam was really like. On the other hand, it is used as an unchecked license not to write according to any accepted guidelines, and even to use words like \\"spade\\" needlessly.<br /><br />Herr's book was well received upon its release, but it does not hold up so well now. Herr used songs, lyrics and drugs to try to stretch the boundaries of what writing can be, but it does not quite work. Stephen King is another writer fond of frequently inserting song lyrics into his writing. The problem with this is, the songs and lyrics that have special meaning to the author may not have any significance whatsoever to the reader. So while the author may be accurately recreating even the background details of his experiences, as far as drugs and music are concerned, the reader typically cannot fully relate, if at all.<br /><br />Herr certainly got plenty of mileage out of his Vietnam experiences - he also contributed to the screenplays for the films Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />Certainly, Dispatches is not as good as the gushing reviewers on the jacket would have us believe; at least, not any more. If, at the time it was published, it truly did offer revelatory insight into American culture, it has not held up so well. Yet Dispatches remains valuable and interesting, particularly as a journal of American culture in wartime Vietnam, but less so as a piece of New Journalism.<br /><br />RECOMMENDEDtylistic selection on Herr's part helps to underscore to the reader what Vietnam was really like.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is a great movie with an excellent soundtrack by talented artists. First look at the DVD case photo made me think, Oh great it's a love story (not my favorite theme). But this is an excellent look at the 60's with many of the great Beatle's songs to back it up.
0385522401|4.0|A striking portrait of a young couple on their wedding night in 1960s England.  What makes this short book exceptional is the way McEwan structures the relationship between the two.  In essence, it is a study of communication failure and through the narrator, we know much more about each character than they do about each other.  The reader gets an in depth look into the thoughts, needs and desires of the young man and woman, but they struggle to express these sentiments (blame it on the era or the inherent nature of female-male relationships) and this complete failure culminates in a rather intense ending.  Well-written and deeply emotional, this little novel will linger for awhile after you've finished.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Its impossible to stress how incredible this series is. I am an avid nature film lover so I know I am biased.  But even my finance who is a little tired of me saying to our guests \\"Hey have you seen planet earth, there are these caves...\\"  She admits the visuals of it are breathtaking.  I will say that this review is of the standard DVD edition. And it looks great, but having seen the HD versions I realize what I am missing.  Unlike most HDDVD's you are likely to see, this was entirely filmed in Digital HD from the start so the picture is so amazing at full resolution.  So if you are a blue ray or HDDVD adopter, you should probably grab that one.<br /><br />Oh and the other caveat, make sure whatever format you buy, get the BBC version it is narrated by David Attenbourough (sp?)  The guy is an incredible narrator of Nature Documentaries and the Aliens chick just cant beat him on getting you excited about what your seeing.<br /><br />CLICK BUY NOW!!!!

B000JJRIN4|2.0|Gwen has talent, but she's not showing it anymore.  Maybe she does only have once face, but I would like to see her gain a new inspiration.  She's not a singer, let's establish that right now.  But she is an artist, and a very creative one when she's inspired.  But this album is not all that impressive.  She can make great music when the chips are stacked in her favor, but seems to be running out of luck now...
0689853491|5.0|Quite simply a children's classic. My 2.5year old loves this book. We also recommend checking out the Michael Rosen reading of this book on You Tube.
B00005R2M3|4.0|...but unfortunately, Shakira will not be around for the long-haul.  She simply is unable to get outside of her niche and find a new voice.  Her market was established with her unique break between her vocal registers, and since that is the only sound she is able to sing with, her popularity is virtually dead.<br /><br />Even if she were to change her style, there would be little hope for her, since her voice is not outstanding.  However, she will be remembered as one that helped to open the doors of American music to the music of the world.  She did a wonderful job, and will remain an icon for it.  Her best bet now is to come out with clothing and cologne lines to make her money... or start producing!<br /><br />Best advice... keep those song licenses close to you, girl.  Covers are gonna bring you a lot of cash!
B000YAA68C|5.0|I saw this movie with a friend when it was out in the theater and - I kid you not - we spent the entire movie vacillating between sobbing and laughing, often both in the same scene.  This is by far the best romance movie I've seen in recent memory, and one that touches a very tender place for those who are married or in a long-term relationship with someone they absolutely adore.  I wanted to make my husband go in for a complete physical after I left the theater out of fear of losing HIM way too soon.  And the man's healthy!    Anyway, I give this movie two huge thumbs up.  Gerard Butler is incredibly sexy, sweet and romantic in the movie, Hilary Swank is absolutely perfect in her portrayal of the young widow, and the supporting cast was nothing short of brilliant.  This is definitely a must-see movie in my humble opinion.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|after waiting for so long at last we have a masterpiece with good sound and a very good picture.  a dvd you must own.
0679720200|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I got really into existentialism back in highschool before reading this (and it helps to know a little about that) and I just fell in love with the book. Not much happens really, plot wise. And, its almost impossible to view the main character in a good light, so it's really not like many books out there. But because of these facts, and not in spite of them, the book is able to hold your entire attention for its terribly short duration.
0525948023|5.0|I AM REALLY ENJOYING THIS BOOK.  I HAD MY DOUBTS AT FIRST, PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT IT WAS HARD TO READ.  I AM FASCINATED WITH THIS THOUGHT PROVOKING AND SPIRTUALLY ENLIGHTENING BOOK.

B000BKJ78K|1.0|Why does everything need to be changed?  Why are things being added to a trilogy that was perfect the way that it was?  George Lucas is litterally smashing my childhood into a million pieces with his \\"Improved trilogy.\\"  As I was watchng this \\"new\\" trilogy, I was willing to make peace with all the little added bullcrap that he added until the end of Return of the Jedi...why?  Why did he think it was a good idea to add hayden christianson as a replacement to the original anakin skywalker?  Why George?  Why?
B000PMGNK4|5.0|Expresses a good quick story arc from the SAC series.  Not as representative of the strengths of the anime, however.
0385338724|5.0|Sophia Kinsella's books are usually very entertaining.  Her books under this name are funny, touching, and make you want to read them all in a day.  Which, I've done.  Remember me?  is no exception.  It's a wonderful story that once you've finished, you'll want to pick it up and read it again.      It's funny because the books she write under her own name, Madeline Wickham, are usually so different from the ones she write under her pen name, more dramatic and more serious in nature.  However, Kinsella's latest is effort feels like she's finally merging two different styles of writing into something everyone can enjoy.  There are serious issues to be dealt with - love, death, marriage, adultery, but they can be dealt with in a humorous and touching way.  I could see her revisiting the characters in this book without the problems she encountered in the Shopaholic books, which let's face it were amusing but dull after a while.  It's a bit boring when the heroine never changes.      Overall, great book, definitely worth buying in hardcover.
B00132D808|5.0|When I first listened to Pretty. Odd., I was a little disappointed. The songs are so different than the ones on their first album that it was like listening a completely different band. However, I kept listening to the songs, and MAN these songs really grow on you! I really like them now! Give the album a chance. It's not what everyone expected, but it's still good. Listen to this album with an open mind, and most importantly know that it's not going to sound like their last album.
B00004W510|2.0|I just never really got these guys. I remember when they hit the scene and everybody when banannas about the purity of the music and the \\"back to basics\\" stuff. Yeah I know that Dylan loved them and that is where the world first saw Robbie Robertson and the rest, but I just never could get excited about it all. I also own Stage Fright and several of Robertson's solo efforts. Nothing from these guys ever struck me as anything other than mediocre and never creative or artistic. They are just a band, The Band, they got that name. Oh well.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|In watching this version of Jane Austen's classic novel of love, marriage, and class distinctions of Regency England, all I could think of was that, while pleasing to the eye, Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen were less playing Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet than versions of Heathcliff and Catherine in Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\".<br /><br />Knightley's Elizabeth struck me as self important, dramatic, and smug rather than intelligent and full of life. Why was she always snarling, smiling, or generally baring her teeth? MacFadyen's Darcy, rather than proud, alternating between shyness and simply looking like he wanted to cry. Where was the pomposity? The disdain for others around him? I saw none of that.<br /><br />This is not even touching the appalling additions of such things as pigs in the living room and the generally unkempt appearance of the Bennets and their living situation. Mr. Bennet was a bookkeeper, a gentleman. The book states that the Bennets were \\"not too poor\\" and still managed to appear well mannered and well groomed despite the lack of funds. So the dirt and the farm animals were unneeded and had no point relevant to the \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" I have read. If they were that poor, what would be the point of the fuss made over Lizzie getting her skirt inches in mud on the way to visit Jane? There'd be nothing to remark on, because it would be the norm. And it is not.<br /><br />But back to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" meets \\"Wuthering Heights\\". I get the idea was likely to appeal to the greater masses. But the Harlequinesque declarations and outright lack of propriety shown in the film - the flowing hair, the over the top emotion, the schmaltz - is counterproductive to the novel. I could buy the sap in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" because Heathcliff and Catherine were both so dramatic on their own that their romance and doom were highlighted by such actions. Mr. Darcy and Lizzie were more circumspect. No less passionate, but their passion lay in their mannerisms and their verbal sparring, not walking around in bare feet, nightgowns, or half-done shirts. No, no, no. Leave that to Emily Bronte, not Jane Austen.<br /><br />As for the rest, no way would single men visit sick single women when they are alone. Reputation, as was one point of the novel, meant everything. Such an action would be scandalous back in the day. A woman would NOT be seen with her hair down. Lizzie would not giggle endlessly and lick her fingers and act as silly as Lydia. No way would Mr. Darcy EVER deliver that letter in the way he did. And the first proposal: the book mentioned Charlotte's parlor. It should have been left at that. The rain was, again, more dramatic, but it did not fit for these characters, especially not at that juncture of their acquaintance. And no way would Lady Catherine go to Longbourn in the dead of night to have it out with Lizzie over her intentions for her nephew. It's all wrong.<br /><br />I am glad for those who enjoy this version, but if the filmmaker wanted over the top romance, he should have left Jane Austen alone and gone with the more lushly romantic aforementioned Emily Bronte. The Bronte-ization of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" left me cold and diluted Jane Austen's observations about love, marriage, society, and money and turned the story into just another romance flick. Give me the A&E miniseries, please.
B00001OH7P|3.0|I remember when this came out I hated it. My one buddy who owned his own car from whom I always got a ride, told me to shut up, listen to what he wanted to play in his car, or walk. So I listened to this a lot and eventually grasped the value of this music. The guitarwork was seemingly unique and suited to the spaced out nature of the songs and I loved the concept. If you simply look at this CD as a well recorded grouping of songs with a theme which brings them together, it is a good listen. I am still not a diehard Bowie fan and never will be. I have never liked his deliberate chameleonisms and the fact that so much of his talent is contrived showmanship instead of musicianship. Certainly, I feel that Ziggy was his best and is still great to listen to. I have always just forgotten about the crappy bi-sexual nonsense and got off on the rockin tracks for what they are.
0385338724|4.0|I love sophie kinsella and this book did not disappoint.  While I still love the shopoholic books the most, this book kept my interest and made me smile.  It's a very lighthearted book that deals with the issue of having the life you may think you want but finding out when you live that life that it's not all it's cracked up to be.
B000002OX7|5.0|If just for \\"Goin Mobile\\" this is a five star. Power, class, cool they had it all. Not enough can be said about the Who. This is the one must have if you don't have any of the other great stuff from them. A massive attack from one of the top 4 groups of all time.
1400079594|5.0|While this book was quite enjoyable, it is not a thriller, filled with twists and conspiracies and secret societies, along the lines of the Da Vinci code, which starred Tom Hanks.  In fact, there is no code-breaking at all.  Read this book for its comedy, not for its code.
B000EHSVS2|1.0|I purchased the DVD movie, Patton, because it is one of my favorite films. It came as a two-disc set. The first disc was the movie, but not the complete version of the movie. It only showed the first half. The Normandy section and the ending was completely left out, although it did show the credits.<br /><br />The second disc was only the bonus features, which showed a documentary and clips of the movie.<br /><br />I'm am very disappointed in this purchase.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I suppose it could be said it was my misfortune to be introduced to Pride and Prejudice by the 1983 BBC adaption by Fay Weldon directed by Cyril Coke and starring Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul. Not the 1940 Leonard version with Oliver and Greer Garson, nor the later BBC adaptation with Colin Firth, and not, alas, this 2005 version measure up in tone or historical accuracy. The beauty and faithfulness of Weldon's script, the spot-on casting and attention to historical detail more than make up for the lesser production values.      Keira Kneightly fails completely to project the moral character of Jane, conveying little more than a sort of morose petulance with her vacant, glazed-over expressions, colossus of a jaw and toothy mouth. Spoiled and resentful instead of spirited and principled, her emotionally constipated delivery of lines seems forced and pugnacious rather than courageous. Nothing about her invites us in--she is too stiff and self-conscious, too virginal. Sentimental music by the yard and grand landscapes are no substitute for emotional resonance with the protagonist. The thread-bear script is in part to blame for the failure to convincingly embody the moral- and class-conflicts that drive the novel. Jane is never allowed to manifest as the outspoken, head-strong, shrewd yet empathic young woman that she is. Perhaps her character was dumbed-down out of a fear that a modern-day audience, with its egalitarian prejudices (the taboo against distinguishing oneself intellectually) and despite its enlightened feminism, might be put-off by such a characterization. Elizabeth Garvey, on the other hand, managed to be alluringly feminine (warm) and intriguingly articulate--the ideal balance of head and heart.     The film fails to convey the mores or the class- and sex distinctions of the period with any conviction. The minds behind this adaptation seem younger (more beholden to youth-culture) and older (wan and worn-out) at once. Judi Dench does raise the octane level with her caricature of Lady Catherine De Bourg's demonic fury. But Brenda Blithyn as Mrs. Bennett is not irritating or shrewish enough by half, and Donald Sutherland, emasculated and mumbling his way through in one continuous aside, is completely wasted. Only in the 1983 BBC adaptation has the character of the father been allowed to assert his patriarchal prerogative and provide an effective check to the over-bearing and histrionic mother, who was meant to be insufferable. Matthew MacFaydean makes a sleepy, crestfallen and disengaged Darcy, where Rintoul is authentically haughty with hidden depths. A lot was sacrificed in the characterizations of both Darcy and Jane to make them `likable' to modern day hipsters. The result is a confection of a film, hollow and without integrity, content to be a historical spectacle.     By the time Darcy and Jane come together in Cyril Coke's 1983 adaptation--without as much as a kiss, just a couple strolling through a park--it's quite overwhelming. I'm hard-pressed to think of another reconciliation in all of film that could compete for impact. And it's all done with spoken dialogue--the sublimely beautiful language of Jane Austen faithfully rendered by Fay Weldon--and silence. There is an element of cosmic tragedy as the camera sweeps up over the trees, even as they emerge at long last from all their pretenses and misunderstandings (\\"pride and prejudice!\\") to bear their souls, happily surrendering to one another. It is the archtypal situation of love supervening upon hatred (envy).     Kneightly and MacFaydean, by contrast, seem more like teen-agers who suddenly stop playing hard to get and find they have the house to themselves. Had they consummated their passion before our very eyes to sweeping violins we could not have cared any less. So if you want to be transported to another time and mind-set, to a pre-modern world at once more rigid and more genteel, try the Coke adaptation. It is as close as you will get to readingthe novel without actually reading it.

B0015T7Q98|5.0|OK, so its completely different than \\"A Fever\\" however, if it was the same, it would receive harsh reviews of expectations of lightning striking twice.  This album is refreshing, clean, interestingly melodic, and delightful.  The boys grew up.  I always believed they were daring, but the fact they would put this out, proves it.  Yes, they may lose their younger fans, however, they have definitely gained my respect with their poetic gamble.  Bravo Panic.
B0010AN7Y0|3.0|Being a big fan of Mr. Laurie, I've been getting everything that he has been in...(have \\"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\\" sketch comedies so wanted to continue watching S Fry and him act together)as well as K Branaugh. Pretty good story line with good interplay of characters (clever way of showing time passing) but glad I saw it at home and not in theater. Feel good friend movie.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I thought this was the one from the Jane Austin series shown recently on PBS, but it is not!  Althought it is ok, I doubt I will watch it again,  I'll most likely put in in our annual Spring Garage Sale!
0143038419|5.0|Yesterday I received two copies I ordered from Amazon, for two friends.  One in English and one in Spanish.  The book is funny, and fun to read.  It make me laugh and at the same time make me think a lot about myself.  Every woman could feel identified at one point or another with the writer.  I read the book so fast that I want to read it again, but this time stopping to think more about parts that should be giving more time.  A good mix of spirituality, meditation and humor.

B0010X745K|1.0|Despite cool visualization for the creatures, this has to be the worst movie that I have ever seen.  One could try to say that this was a story of \\"what would you do in a situation like this?\\", but that explaination is hardly plausable.  No character reacted smartly or realistcally, even Thomas Jane's character is not excused.  Also, I am really tired of Hollywood portraying belief in God as something meant for extremists and radical zealots.  I'm also no fan of twisting the Bible to fit the storyline.  The characters and dialogue moved at a snail's pace.  Two hours was way too long to sit through a movie with an ending like that.  The omninous \\"MIST\\" dissapates in seconds?  The giant creatures taken down so simply?  It all just doesn't add up.  Either the screen writer changed some things or Stephen King has definitely lost something.  As you can guess...I will never recommend this movie to anyone.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Having been the quirky lead singer of No Doubt ever since the late eighties, Gwen Stefani (and her fellow band members) have evolved over the years.  When it was decided that she would take a break from the band to pursue a solo career, she unleashed Love. Angel. Music. Baby., which was an exhilerating odyssey of catchy retro tunes.  Unfortunately, her second stab at solo work does not fair quite as well.  With The Sweet Escape, Gwen ditches the electro-pop of L.A.M.B. for an R&B approach.  Although lyrically her wit is as sharp as ever in \\"Yummy\\" and \\"Breakin' Up,\\" the music isn't always as good as it should be . Ranging from the synth-rich rock of \\"Wonderful Life\\" to the emotionally-tinged pop of \\"4 In The Morning,\\" most of the other songs sound like standard R&B tunes that have played on the airwaves constantly for the past ten years.  The main thing that keeps this album together is the undeniable talent with words that Gwen possesses.  Although this is nothing close to the masterpiece that L.A.M.B. was, this album isn't particularly terrible.  It is merely aggravating that someone with so much talent delivered something that is mostly mediocre.
B000SX8BXC|5.0|Thanks for the linux downloader.  From now on I'll only buy music through Amazon.  Norah Jones is the best female artist in the world.
B00132D808|1.0|Whereas A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was consistently clever, catchy, and fun, Panic At The Disco's latest venture fails to impress.  Entitled Pretty. Odd., the album fails in all categories.  They have totally abandoned the electronically-charged rock that defined them with their previous release, vying for a more serious Beatles-like approach.  On top of that, the sexual undertones and tongue-in-cheek humor of their lyrics is now long gone.  Now all of the songs are about a lot nonsense, with about a dozen references to the moon for some reason or another.  Although this album might appeal to fans of the Beatles, fans of Panic At The Disco will likely find it a terrible disappointment, made even worse by the fact that A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was so much fun.  Granted, the single \\"Nine In The Afternoon\\" is mildly good, but the rest of the songs are simply not up to par.
B0011Z3DAC|5.0|Thanks for the Linux downloader.  I'm only buying music through you guys from now on.

B000056N8X|4.0|Highlander: Endgame seems to pick up not long after the ending of the television series, with Duncan seeking his mentor and fellow clansman Connor, who has grown tired of the Game and gone into \\"Sanctuary\\" (I'll not give away any more of the plot....watch it to see what happens..).    One thing though...any die-hard Highlander fan knows that Duncan was never married (see season 2, episode 4, \\"The Darkness\\", in which Tessa dies), yet in Endgame, his \\"wife\\" reappears....whats up with that?
B00102FELM|5.0|As a die-hard Scorpions fan, I am thrilled with this DVD. How fantastic is it to see 60,000 fans rocking to one of the most long lived bands ever?  The sound is great, the video is great, and it is cool to see ex-band members joining in the \\"reunion\\", playing old hits, going back over three decades.  The packaging is a bit cheesy, but other than that, I highly recommend it!
0316001821|5.0|This book is by far one of the best books I've ever read.  It's up there in my top 5 for sure.  From the very beginning I was hooked.  I read this in 18 hours - I couldn't put it down.  After I WAS finished I thought about it for days afterwards.  Makes me think Alice Sebold has some secret insight into the hereafter or something.  Is she right?  It all make sense to me now if she is right.  That the loved ones that passed do stick around a while until they know we've \\"moved on\\", then they themselves can \\"move on\\" to the real heaven.  This book comforts me almost.  Alice is brilliant.  As a new author myself, I feel words the same as she does.
B00122M2QU|5.0|DANG!  (Or some other except deleted comment that Amazon won't post) I was hoping to be the first to post the first review for this CD. The day that all `Metal' fans have been waiting for has been delivered, finally! Cavalera Conspiracy - INFLiKTED has been released. This is not Soulfy, this is not Nailbomb, not Sepultura w/Derrick Green or any other combination of a projects since Max Cavalera parted from Sepultura. This is the 'Cavalera Conspiracy' and it sounds like a CD that should have been the next Sepultura CD after `Roots!' Sorry, `Against' didn't quite cut it! This is SPEED, THRASH, HEAVY, AGGRESSIVE, and FREAKIN `IN YOUR FACE' Metal! I know all of us Sepultura fans were waiting for a Max / Sepultura reunion, but guess what... INFLiKTED is what you need to cure that! This just goes to show that these two brothers are what made the `real music!'
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Like many, I've seen the theatrical release and though : \\"Good movie...but...\\" It left me lukewarm, and there are too many elements that not quite make sens in the theatrical version. In an effort to get rated as PG-13 lots of the best this movie has to offer went down the drain, making for a badly butchered one-dimensional version of it.     The director's cut is finally solving this injustice and this make for a whole new movie, with a very exiting plot, and a whole new sub-plot that actually bring a LOT to the movie. No more wishy-washy morale and illogical sex scene in this one. And all the elements of the theatrical releases are actually put in the right order as well, so that you aren't left wondering why on Earth did Matt wear a grey suit in the morning and is shown later in the evening in a black one when he leaves office.    And for those who like me felt that Jon Favreau's role as Foggy got really truncated and should have been more, well the director's cut deliver, he is brilliant in his comical relief role and will have you laugh all through that otherwise dark and intense movie.    If you have to pruchase Daredevil on DVD, this is the only buy worth your money, give the  other edition a big miss.

0452289963|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I found myself reading the chapters more than once because I wanted to make certain I fully understood Dr. Tolle's message and how it applied to my life.  I highly recommend it; especially to people who find themselves constantly on the go and trying to get so many things done without taking the time to appreciate how important it is to live \\"in the moment\\".
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This is an awsome concert. I just can't watch it enough. It's one of my most prize DVD's. I recomend it to everyone.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I just adore this movie. EVER AFTER with Drew Barrymore is one of the most romantic films I've ever seen. Drew shines and endears as Danielle De Barbarac aka Cinderella.  Dougray Scott is Prince Henry and he fits this role perfectly. The rest of the supporting cast (Anjelica Huston, et al) compliment the leads in fine ways.      This is what I would expect a modern (sort of) take on our beloved fairy tale to be. It's not trying to be the Disney version, nor is it trying to be the fairy tale. EVER AFTER holds it's own.  The characters and the story are developed in ways that fit their apparent personalities and not just the plot.  For example, it's clear from the beginning that the Baroness (stepmother Anjelica) has no use for Danielle, and her treatment of her up til the very end is nothing but contempt.  Stepsis Marguerite is a spoiled brat who will do whatever to get what she wants.  Danielle is a free spirit (I usually hate describing someone that way) who is full of dreams but makes room for others in those dreams.  Henry is a caged bird trying to break out of the mold expected of him in order to forge his own way in life.  Each of the characters provides depth to the story, including the gypsies (very funny scenes).  EVER AFTER fleshes out the story of Cinderella by giving Henry and Danielle a chance to get to know each other.      At the risk of sounding super cheesy, I must say that I can watch this movie over and over and feel like I'm watching it for the first time. The direction is perfect, the visuals are great, and the acting choices are superb.      Definitely rent this or watch on TV, but you might find yourself running out to buy it.  Enjoy.

0374280967|5.0|This little novella was a total delight to read, from first page to last. I have recommended it to everyone I know!<br /><br />Bennett had a clever and unusual premise for this book...seemingly light,  yet he managed to write about reading, writing, and how they affect us....and open our eyes.<br /><br />I must admit to wondering how in the heck he could possibly end this story, and was totally delighted at the ending!!!<br /><br />Bravo!
B000F2C87Q|5.0|When I read the album notes for Chulahoma, I discovered that Dan Auerbach shared exactly the same revelatory astonishment I experienced when I first heard and saw Junior Kimbrough. I will never forget the first time I heard him, on Robert Mugge's amazing documentary, Deep Blues. At the time Mugge filmed him in 1990 there was no such thing as a Junior Kimbrough album, although Junior was already 60 at the time. I could not understand how this unique genius had been overlooked for so long. I had never heard the term before, but I started calling Junior Kimbrough's music \\"Trance Blues.\\" That's what it did to me: put me in a trance. That's what it did to Dan, and that's what this album will do to you if you let it. With Junior as his muse, it must have taken considerable courage for Dan to do this album, but the Black Keys pull it off. They take the completely original Kimbrough sound and feeling, and carry it forward musically into the present, adding to and modernizing the sound a bit, but carrying this brilliant musician's ideas forward. They do it with their own songs and God bless 'em, they do it with Junior's stuff too. Thankfully, the Black Keys will not have to wait until they are 62 before they are discovered. They are on the way to huge popularity with their own songs, but if you really want to understand where they come from, listen to Chulahoma. And listen to Junior too, All Night Long.
B0015HS5TA|4.0|Nothing but fun from beginning to end. We left the theater feeling happy, a rarity with all the doom and gloom, bloody shoot-'em-up movies that are being made today. Great acting, good writing, beautiful sets...and lots of laughs. Where else can you get all that for under $10?<br /><br />Amy Adams is AMAZING. Is there anything she cannot do?
B000S0GYRU|5.0|This is The Kind OF Movie That You Really Have To Have All The Lights Out In The Middle Of The Night To Really Get The Good Feel Of This Movie I Love This Movie, I Remember Seeing This In The Movies Back In The Late 70's And Early 80's It Was Really Scarey Then This And Other Horror Movies Me And My Friends Used To Go And See On A Saturday Afternoon When I Was A Kid, (Damn Them Was The Good Ole Days)
B0011HOEYY|5.0|This is a very fabulous epic movie.  It is very exciting and intense.  Compare to others, this is a very good movie.  For the story, it is good true story to inspire to this movie.  For the acting, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe were the man to make it all worked in this movie.  Also, Lymari Nadal also acted well as she played as Denzel's wife.  For the direction, it is all good with no doubts.  Finally for the visuals, it suits the movie itself because dark visuals will suit the movie because it is about gangster.  Overall, it is a good movie.<br /><br />For the DVD itself, I loved it because the extended edition was excellent.  Maybe, I felt that I shouldn't see this on the theater too soon.  It was all worth it to wait for a while.  When this DVD came, boy, it rocked for the extended edition that I watched.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have been watching this series as it is released.  It is very powerful stuff.  I got chills all the way down my spine when they read the Declaration of Independence for the first time.  It has a great soundtrack of really moving theme music.  Giamatti seems to whine a bit too much but I've always thought that watching his stuff.  Overall I am really excited about this series and my wife is pretty into it as well.
B00005ASOI|2.0|I had wanted to see this movie forever, none of the local video stores carried it. The reviews and Bravo's reccommendations made me sure I would love this. I did not. The color and sets were amazing. The story and acting were not. There were many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. I understand why some people would like this, but there are many horror film buffs that find this out of place in cannon, and I 'm one of them.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|The movie was fairly good overall but the ending tanks I mean seriously if they had just waited 5 - 10 minutes. I give the ending a -5 but threst was ok I'll give it a 3.
B000068IEU|4.0|I was one of those kids whose mom let them watch anything they wanted, and I remember renting this. I remember thinking 70's, eww bad, turn it off, which was a good thing since I was 10 years old. I watched it last week, and it scared me deeply. This is a movie that I doubt I will watch again, but I'm so glad I did see the whole thing once. The violence from both sides was sickening, but the story made it's point. I'm not sure that I agree, being a parent myself, but it did make it. I didn't like the cheesy movies and the way they made the police look like clowns, but those are my only things that I don't \\"like\\" about this movie. I put like in quotes because who can really like such brutal rapes and murders?
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this movie. I thought I would watch one segment a night but couldn't stop watching. Stayed up late and watch the entire movie in one night.
B000OV170W|5.0|This was my favorite Picoult book to date.  It was an emotionally charged narrative focusing on a difficult choice.  Anna was born specifically to be a genetic match for her sister, Kate, who suffers from a form of leukemia.  But as the girls get older and Kate remains sick, more is demanded of Anna.  She is expected to contribute more of herself to save her sister beyond just the initial umbilical cord blood.  By the time Anna is 13 and Kate is 16, their parents have \\"asked\\" Anna to donate a kidney in a last-ditch effort to save Kate.  This prompts Anna to hire lawyer Campbell Alexander to defend her request to be medically emancipated.  What follows is a moral and ethical courtroom debate regarding the choices that have been made on behalf of Anna.<br /><br />Told from multiple perspectives, the story gives the reader a look into the minds of everyone who is affected by these difficult choices.  Of course, there's Anna, whose 13-year-old voice is mature for her age, but still confused and youthful.  Her mother, Sarah, provides the flashbacks to Kate's illness, Anna's conception, and their childhood.  Brian, their firefighter father, is battling an arsonist while dealing with his family's crisis, while his 18-year-old delinquent son Jesse isn't making things easier for Brian on both fronts.  Then you have the lawyer Campbell Alexander and Julia, the court appointed guardian ad litem, who have been reunited by this case fifteen years after a bad high school break-up.<br /><br />This was a great read that I couldn't put down for two days until I reached the last page.  Be sure to have tissues on hand for the conclusion, which both shocked and amazed me.  Bravo!
B000TSIK14|4.0|Bought this as a present for my wife (big Scorpions fan) and I hadn't heard much Scorpions since Love At First Sting. She slapped the CD in the player and I was bowled over. This is a really really good disc. Heavier than expected, but a good melodic sense. Klaus is in amazing form. After many repeated listenings, there are a couple of weaker tracks, but Hour 1, 321 and Love Is War are standouts. An excellent listen.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had read about North & South for some time but I did not think it would be my cup of tea but it is by far my favorite movie now. The acting is top notch and the story is excellent. What chemistry the two main actors have! Just can't say enough good things about it. I had never seen Richard Armitage in anything before now I want to see everything he has been in. He is an excellent actor! I also want to read the book now. Daniella Denby-Ashe as Margaret was wonderful! Buy it! You won't regrete it!!
B00009P1O2|4.0|The only thing that really stops me from giving maximum praise to this dvd is that at least one of the cameras that was used to record this footage was apparently either poor quality, malfunctioning, or maladjusted. It leaves ugly streaks on the image from the sensor being over saturated by bright lights. Most all of the other cameras didn't appear to produce that artifact. Also, Freddie's voice cracks a couple times but that's understandable given the context of the concert, and he deals with it like the professional he was. Overall sound quality of the DVD is excellent. This is by far the best DVD of Queen live. I'd rank the Montreal DVD just below this one too. Get both!
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Another reviewer captured it by saying, this is a love it or leave it movie.  I didn't have high hopes, mainly because most of the 100% CGI adult oriented films have been lackluster at best.  But being a huge fan of the epic poem of Beowulf, how could I not watch it.<br /><br />I have found myself amongst the \\"leave it\\" crew.  The CGI was very good, but like all CGI, everyone moved just a hair too slowly, everyone appears to be \\"creeping\\" about.  All of the CGI characters were made to look exactly like the actors who voiced them so they might as well have just used real actors.  My main issue with this isn't the film itself, but rather that they turned the epic hero into such a louse that I was thrilled to death when he met his demise (if you didn't know he died, go back to 8th grade and read the poem)<br /><br />Certainly the true Beowulf, had he existed, would have been a flawed character, but they made him a loud mouthed, lying, bragging, womanizing buffoon of a man, easily duped and with little loyalty or ability to love.  He was so despicable to me that I almost didn't watch the end of the film.  Then the change in the story in regards to Grendal's mother and the Dragon... I know it was to tie everything in together but I would have been much happier had they stayed a little closer to the story that managed to survive for over a thousand or so years.  I know, let's remake the Odyssey and make Odysseus a pedophile! I know that's a bit extreme but that is how I felt after watching this travesty.  Had it not bore the name of Beowulf then I might have been able to tolerate this film.  But even then I would have had a hard time rooting for the main character.  3 of 5 stars, mainly for the CGI, they did a pretty good job on that end of the movie.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|The cd arrived very quickly. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Beatles music. If you have seen Across the Universe and liked it you need to buy this cd. It has extended versions of the songs you love from the movie, including Eddie Izzards version of \\"Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite.\\"
B00007KWHG|5.0|I bought this after seeing the Jersey Boys.  They are awesome!  I never realized how many songs they had, or how many I recognize.
B00005JPTK|3.0|I guess I have to agree with other reviews I've read in print and online - this movie was good for the first hour, and then the ending was kind of a deflation of the mood that was set in the start. The nature of the zombie/vampires was not well explored, particularly the clear demonstration of their vestigial intelligence and apparent social organization. The film just kind of gallumphs to a close.  I would also have to agree with criticisms of the sometimes-chunky CGI; thi sis the first film I've ever saw that I actually thought, gee, it wouldn't be so bad if at some future date they went back and retouched some of the computer graphics. Much of it was surprisingly cheesy.  Will Smith does a good job in his role -- loved the dog, as well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue)
0345472322|5.0|For several months now I've been enjoying and at the same time agonizing over the book, MINDSET, The New Psychology of Success, by Carol S. Dweck, PH.D., a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. The book presents the results of over 20 years of research into the question of why some experience more success than others.        \\"For 20 years, my research has shown that the view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life. It can determine whether you become the person you want to be and whether you accomplish the things you value.\\"    The views she is talking about are our old friends, nature versus nurture, genes versus environment, I.Q. versus effort. She doesn't really get into the the issue of whether some people are naturally more intelligent or talented than others, that's all besides the point. What her research shows is that people with a fixed mindset, i.e. they believe that their intelligence, creativity, abilities and talents are fixed and cannot be increased, cannot be grown, tend to be less successful than people with a growth mindset, who believe that their intelligence, creativity etc. can be developed. The interesting thing is that it doesn't matter if your fixed mindset is high or low, that is if you're a positive thinker or a negative thinker; either way a fixed mindset will impeded your success.    The book is filled with examples of the two types from the world of sports and business and sketches of her tests of the theory with elementary school children and college students.    After thinking about it for several months, here's my take on what Prof. Dweck has discovered. The definition of success for a person with a growth mindset is growth and improvement. Have I improved? Am I doing better today than yesterday? These are the questions a person with a growth mindset uses to evaluate performance. If I have improved then I am succeeding. If I have not improved then I need to change the way I'm studying, or practicing or preparing so I can be more successful.    On the other hand a  person with a fixed mindset asks, What is my I.Q.? Am I smarter than the others? Am I better than everyone else? Am I worse than everyone else? Am I talented or untalented? Do I have musical abiilty or not? Do I have the talent to be a writer or do I not? I think that being discovered is one definition of fixed mindset success. If the fixed mindset person's talent  hasn't been discovered he concludes that it's because he is not talented, or people are against him or no one will help him.    The growth mindset person sees the trophy, the medal, the promotion, as a mere byproduct of the growth that he has experienced. For the fixed mindset person the trophy, the medal, the promotion, is the point, they are the outward manifestations of his inward superiority.    The irony is that the fixed mindset person ends up sabotaging himself because his fixed mindset world view also makes it difficult for him to take risks, or to develop his abilities, in other words, to grow. The fixed mindset person doesn't, after all, believe in growth. As a result fixed mindset people become quite frustrated.    Prof. Dweck's studies give a scientific basis for something that Coach Wooden, of UCLA Basketball fame, discovered long ago: Focus on effort not winning. The factors which determine whether you will win or loose are not all within your control, but the effort you put in to developing and executing your game is.    I don't believe that I can overstate the importance of this book. I've been reading self help, positive thinking, motivational books since at 10 years of age I picked up a Norman Vincent Peale book that my mom had checked out of the library. Those books, all good, are trying to deal with the problem by attacking the fruit of an individuals mindset. Prof. Dweck is attacking the problem at the root.     This book was for me a very uncomfortable read and forced me to analyze my own mindset and much to the chagrin of this basically fixed mindset person I've discovered that I am in many areas a fixed mindset person. OUCH! But what's worse is realizing that many of the things which I have said and done, thinking I was encouraging others and building them up to achieve success, were in fact helping them to fail. OUCH! OUCH! Well the good news is that you can change your mindset.    Greg Marquez  goyomarquez@earthlink.net
B000TGELLY|3.0|For me this was an attempt to remake Gladiator on a grander scale. The same sort of etheral music is used. It has a very impressive cast list and uses a director who has made some excellent films in his time.<br /><br />That it succeeds partially is a tribute to most of the cast. Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole both give fine performances as the respective Kings of Greece and Troy. Eric Bana is pretty good as Hector and even Brad Pitt is reasonable as Achilles. The battle scenes are well done, although the over reliance on CGI effects is painfully obvious in places.<br /><br />However, Brad Pitt is not Russell Crowe (who when it matters is a really good actor), and for that matter Wolfgang Peterson is not as consistently a good filmmaker as Ridley Scott. In Gladiator I sympathised with Russell Crowe's character, and I hated Commodous. In Troy Hector was the most likable character but his future in the film was blatently obvious after a short period of time. Achilles was not a sympathetic character and sometimes I found Pitt a bit robotic. In fairness some of his fight scenes are very well done.<br /><br />So its well worth watching, and at the right price I might buy it to watch again in five years time. BTW forget completely about any historical accuracy, its just a film.
0307276902|4.0|For all of the controversy surrounding this book, it is and remains a great read.  I don't know of any, any memoir that has the whole truth in it.  And I don't care.  What I do care about is the quality of the story and the writing.  The writing is cumbersome but the quality of the story is superb.  You start out not feeling what he's feeling, then you start to, then you are immersed in his miserable life, pulling for him to live.  It's a good read and one you won't forget.
0393327345|5.0|Fight Club makes such a clear point about today's society. The apathetic nature of our generation allows us to search for something better without us being willing to actually create something better for ourselves. So instead of creation we are drawn to destruction- the new form of creation. Fight Club is a beautifully written satire that intrigues the reader from the very start.
630522885X|4.0|Lola was a wildly creative woman who kept reinventing herself to meet her ever-changing needs.  Passionate, headstrong, opportunistic, shameless, amoral, she essentially flipped a not-so-ladylike finger at a repressive society and lived a fascinating life that today would garner headlines but lift few eyebrows.  Her life story might even seem somewhat inspiring today -- how in the world did she have the strength? The nerve?     This gorgeous movie made in the fifties has little shock and awe factor now but back then we would have viewed it from behind our (figurative) fans. Oh my wasn't she naughty, wink wink--an attitude younger viewers probably won't understand.   Today the film is definitely worth a look as a stylized piece of art. Martine Carrol, who was many times more beautiful than Lola was,  did all she could do with the script, seductive and calculating early on, and later, when she became a circus act, playing the part as if she were a Ziegfeld girl, silent behind her glorious figure and feathers . Lola is presented as an object of shame, a circus act to titillate the worst and derive  pity from the best, while Peter Ustinov's ringmaster acts as a mirror reflecting the hypocrisy of society.       I was delighted to see a very young Oskar Werner -- one of the great actors of all time, known for his starring roles in Ship of Fools and the wonderful Jules and Jim. Here he plays a pivotal role as the schoolboy seducee who rallies to save his beloved though she had cast him aside in favor of the king.     Yes, the disc has its problems, but not so many that the beauty of the film is lost.  It was nominated for an academy award for art direction, well deserved.  The .film's exaggerated lushness means that I won't watch it often, but yes, again and perhaps then again.    To get a more objective look at the life of Lola Montez, I highly recommend Bruce Seymour's excellent biography, \\"Lola Montez\\" available at Amazon:    http://www.amazon.com/Lola-Montez-Life-Bruce-Seymour/dp/0300074395/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206650278&sr=1-1

0321544080|5.0|Although I will probably never photograph a movie star or an Olympic Athlete on top of the Empire State building, McNally's lighting how-to's have already helped me in my photography.  The photos alone are worth the price of the book, but the stories that go along with each photo and the \\"How to get this type of shot\\" make the book a valuable learning tool for most photographers.
B0010X745K|1.0|A:Hey lets a make a movie full of murder and suicide!    B:No, that's so common, everyone does that.    A:Yeah, you're right.  Let's add a sadistic scene of wanton child murder by his dad.  Oh, and for a great effect let's have that same dad promise to protect his child.    B:You are so right.  That's insane; everyone will love that and its at least a little different.  But what do they call that?    As the suicide pact began to form, I started to squirm.  Once all in the car were dead and dear old dad was looking for his personal vehicle to destruction, I was enraged.  How could I have watched this so-so sci-fi action flick for over an hour and find myself ready to cry.  It was horrible and I had trouble enjoying the rest of the night.    Here's another under the radar meaning that I took from this team (and I honestly don't know whose viewpoint we were living through but here it is); they find the value and power of a human life insignificant.  From the swinging soldiers to the murdered son, when times get tough, \\"hey you can always kill yourself or someone else\\".      Maybe the folks that wrote, produced and directed this film have never been exposed to severe depression or mental disease/disorder.  Maybe that would explain their cruelty and lack of consideration for the audiences potential reaction.  Naw, I'm actually, pretty sure its all about dollars and no form of consideration, care or compassion ever came to their way of thinking or obviously into the picture.    Suicide and murder are never the answer.  There is purpose for your life!  Each of us is an awesome created human being.  Your life was planned and purposed.  You can overcome your present trouble.
B000002KKD|5.0|I remember buying this album in high school when it came out and loved it, it was so good being reunited with it some 30 years later.  It still sounds as fresh as it did then, with it's main message \\"If you're in outer space, don't feel out of place, 'cause there are thousands of others like you.\\"  A true new wave classic.
0345452577|1.0|I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman's other books (3-5 stars, the lot), but this book would get 0 if it was an option.  The underlying plot makes no sense - a club of do-gooders who somehow identifies a serial killer (it is never explained how), but instead of doing the obvious they guide our hero to solve it - whilst the killer is carrying on killing other victims!  Almost needless to say, when our hero eventually does identify the killer, he decides to take matters into his own hands (a poorly motivated distrust of the police is to blame) and gets saved in a typical Kellerman last minute shoot-out (my only serious issue with the Alex Delaware series...)  Turns out his mistrust of the cops was misplaced - they end up saving his life.<br /><br />Altogether a poor read - slow paced and a plot that is utterly devoid of logic.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|Considering I have always been a big Eryka Badu fan, I am writing this revue to save you money!  I wondered why one of my friends was willing to just give me this cd.  Once I played it though, I knew why.  Honey is the only saving grace on this cd.  Otherwise, it is weird and simply not good music.  Many of the tracks are catchy, but the lyrics are terrible and take away from any slight hope I had for the song when it started.  Eryka, I am sorry but you are better than this!
0452289963|5.0|As I read Eckhart Tolle's book A NEW EARTH Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, I see parallels with Dr. Abraham Low's book, MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH WILL TRAINING, which is the text for a multitude of self-help groups associated with Recovery, Inc.  I thought also of THE RELAXATION RESPONSE by Herbert Benson, M.D.  Tolle's book approaches the subject from the point of ego psychology and the spiritual insights of great religious teachers including Jesus.  So timeless truths about peace and health, within ourselves, with others and world-wide make this a must read.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Mr. Shannon: You are the one engaging in revisionism history!  Farmers were burned out by Indians, young girls were taken captive, and the Noble Indian was not always so noble in his deeds. Study a little more deeply and you'll see that Western Civilization and war-like Indian tribes were never going to live side-by-side.  Heck, the more war-like tribes didn't even live in peace between themselves. Mr. Ford's movie stands as a beautifully-filmed tribute to the courage of the American Western pioneers.  'Nuff said.
0763627410|5.0|I bought this for my daughter when she was 10 months old. This is by far her favorite book (and we have tons). On every page I ask her, \\"Where's Little Fish?\\" and she points to him! Now that she's one, she usually sits through the whole book. \\"Fish\\" was one of her first words because of this book, only she pronounces it \\"shish\\" So cute! Also, it's beautifully illustrated.
B0015QT78O|5.0|Starman was one of my favorite tv shows of the mid 1980's.  The story takes place about 14 years after the movie of the same name that starred Jeff Bridges.  Young teenager, Scott Hayden, is confronted by the father he never knew (Robert Hays) who also happens to be an alien (space).  Obviously freaked out by this news, it takes awhile for Scott to accept his alien father and the fact that he is part alien himself.  I remember it was touching to watch their relationship develop as the two learn to trust and care about each other, and amusing to see the father learn about humans.    The series premise was that the pair traveled while looking for Scott's mom (Karen Allen in the movie, Erin Gray in the tv show), and along the way they help people in need of help, while outrunning a government agent who suspects they are aliens and has menacing plans for them.  Yes, tv has shown us this on-the-run format before - The Incredible Hulk, The Fugutive - but I liked the inclusion of the father/son relationship in that format, it adds an element unseen in those other shows.     I became a big fan of Christopher Daniel Barnes in the role of Scott, and the fact that he is my age of course helped.   Robert Hays is more well known for the Airplane! movies, but he does an effective job here as the gentle, caring alien.        I would love to have this show available on DVD, I would buy it ASAP!
B000AMJC2K|2.0|To stop the monitor from drooping and suddenly dropping during use, I've had to tighten the bolts so tight with the allen wrench that theyre beginning to strip.  I'm assuming they're going to need further adjustment as time goes by, from the monitor weight and rotation use.  It's probably only a matter of time before they're stripped beyond usability, and I'll have to exchange it for another one.    It also didn't come with long enough screws to fit the back of my monitor, so I had to buy some longer ones.  Not that big of a deal in itself, but overall this product doesn't work as well as I'd hoped.
0393061310|4.0|From a biology point of view, this book was fascinating. Jared Diamond explained plant and animal domestication and the movement of human populations in a very clear way. His exploration of how different societies developed at different rates was also very interesting in that he claims that this difference is based only on geography. This even involves the east-west and north-south axes of the continents and obstacles to communication. And I use the word claims intentionally. Although he makes a good case for his theory, he does not present any alternatives. Just because his theory seems logical, it does not mean that it is the only possible explanation; it might be one of several. Yet Diamond presented his thesis as a proven fact. Indeed, the only shortcoming of this book was that the author got preachy at times, which annoys me even if he is \\"preaching to the choir.\\" In other words, even if I agree with the thesis, I don't like being beaten about the head with it. But if you don't mind the dogmatic tone, then this book is well worth the time.

0618918248|3.0|I think this book is a worthwhile read, thought provoking, but ultimately not terribly satisfying.  I won't list my credentials because it will bias your opinion of my review; they aren't that great anyway.  However, having been a student of religion and philosophy I have to suggest that his retort to the cosmological argument is quite weak; he imposes the \\"big bang\\" as the singularity that stops infinite regress.  Hmmmm.... one is left wondering \\"well, what the heck created that?!\\"  There are no answers for that, that he should admit.  Then invokes later another regress of statistical improbability; that the existence of our world is highly unlikely, therefore the being who created it would be much more complex, and much more unlikely the more unlikely the created events that which he created became - thus statistically God should not exist.  This too, is unsatisfying and \\"proves\\" nothing as the assembly of silicone, plastic and wire into a laptop on which I type is a very unlikely invention (probably deemed impossible by some manic intellectual in the 1950's) and yes, its creator is statistically, a far less likely assembly of organic matter.  (I didn't know they could stack --- that high.... heh-heh)    So, at page 189 I have quit reading as that is the end of his argument.  Now, I have just scanned the chapters and sections leading to the end of the book and I will make a guess as to where this goes.  He will explain the biological makeup of our brains and how we are programmed for religion and how religion fills \\"gaps\\" in our mind to help ease the pain of reality.  Then we will cite specific occurrences of evils inflicted around the world in God's name.  From what I see here, we may go so far as to suggest children are brainwashed and thus abused by religion, etc.... That is fine to have  radical opinions, but I have to wonder if it is valid considering the argument he proposes in chapter 4 is unsatisfying/invalid.  Thus the following opinion becomes conjecture, and is just as dangerous as holding the opposite opinion of \\"absolute God\\" and \\"absolute heaven and hell\\".  That is why I quit reading.    If the world took him seriously, I fear he may be in position to do just as much damage as he hopes to do good.  I do believe the cosmological argument, I do believe humans are \\"arrogantly subjective\\" in their view of themselves and their role in the universe, I do believe the best we can do is \\"hope\\" there is a God and afterlife and such, and \\"hope\\" that this being is benevolent (which I do believe or we wouldn't be here).  We have to awcknoledge there is a good chance there is no God, but we must never say \\"there is no God\\" which Mr. Dawkins concedes in the title of chapter 4.   It is very simple writing really and a mildy interesting read.     Mr. Dawkins makes much ado about what he deems is \\"nothing\\".  Why?  He sure is making a lot of money acting like the 4rth grader who goes around telling every 3rd grader Santa doesn't exist.... not very responsible of you Mr. Dawkins... you are not advancing your cause very well.
B000BCE918|3.0|I ordered this great collection, thinking that I was going to receive the elaborate tri-fold cardboard case (as shown in all the customer images).  Instead I received (twice--because I returned it) a cheesy paper slipsleeve.  One of the main reasons why I bought the DVD set was because of the case, as it folds out as if to resemble the actual gates of jurassic park.  This is a great movie trilogy and should be owned by all movie lovers, but I am very displeased with Amazon's service and false advertising (in a sense)...
B00164FLB2|5.0|\\"Twin Peaks\\" was the ultimate cult TV show -- suspenseful, complex, hilariously written and with hidden layers that casual channel-flippers might not catch.<br /><br />And though it's only eight episodes, the first season of David Lynch and Mark Frost's \\"Twin Peaks\\" is a brilliant piece of television, with a dozen subplots all somehow linked to the mysterious death of the beautiful, troubled Laura Palmer. Brilliant writing, quirky acting, and great cherry pie are all mixed up in the darkly eerie season.<br /><br />For the record, it doesn't contain the pilot episode, where Laura is found \\"wrapped in plastic,\\" and Special Agent Dale Cooper(Kyle McLachlan) is called in to investigate. Nope, the first season starts with the episode after that: Cooper continues to enjoy the comforts of the hotel, while continuing the investigation -- and getting some surprising results from the autopsy.<br /><br />What's more, the question of who killed Laura is getting more complex, due to a bloody shirt, a drug deal, a secret affair and a heart necklace. People catch glimpses of a one-armed man and a grey-haired killer -- and Cooper has a prophetic dream with both men, as well as a red room, a double of Laura Palmer, and a tiny man who dances to jazz music.<br /><br />While Cooper tries to sort out his evidence and dreams, he finds that Twin Peaks is not the small-town idyll he thought it was, and Laura Cooper was enmeshed in its darkness. There are secret love affairs, town crazies, drug smuggling, corporate devilry about a mill, and an evil presence that lurks in the woods nearby...<br /><br />\\"Twin Peaks\\" is hard to even describe, because the plots were a perfect balance of the surreal and mundane. It starts off as a basic murder mystery that allows us to the see the underbelly of rural America. But starting in the second episode, it becomes something much, much more.<br /><br />Lynch loads the storyline down with eerie symbolism, creepy visions and inscrutable (but important) lines (\\"Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....\\"). But he and Frost also spun up some wonderfully quirky scenarios, such as Cooper throwing stones to determine who killed Laura, or his famous dream of a dancing midget and a strange Laura double, both talking in a weird \\"backwards\\" manner.<br /><br />And the dialogue has that brilliace that most series cannot keep going for long (\\"Fellas, don't drink that coffee! You'd never guess... there was a fish in the percolator\\"). Considering how strange the characters are -- including Cooper -- it's not too surprising that it's crammed with quotables (\\"Black as midnight on a moonless night....\\" \\"Pretty black\\").<br /><br />And the characters are VERY strange. Cooper himself is played with quirky brilliance by McLachlan -- he's a bright, lovable, friendly kind of guy who loves Tibetan mysticism, tape recorders and a \\"damn fine cup of coffee.\\" He's not your average hard-nosed FBI agent.<br /><br />And Cooper flanked by a number of talented actors playing two basic varieties of characters: the relatively normal ones with a slight quirk, such as abusive truckers, the sheriff, teen lovers, obnoxious FBI agents. And the REALLY strange ones, like the weird Log Lady, the one-armed man, the spacey Lolita, and the eerie spirits that haunt Twin Peaks.<br /><br />Quirky and surreal TV is currently in vogue, but they all stem from the little town of \\"Twin Peaks,\\" and the first season is an entrancing experience.he magician longs to see....\\").

B0010X73ZG|5.0|This film reminds me of the old fashioned horror films that Universal churned out back in the day. The effects are great but the thing i love most about the film is the way a small town's community are all trapped together in a supermarket and start to slowly turn on one another.    If you're going to buy the film, buy the 2 disc version. Aside from the various featurettes, all of which are highly entertaining, the 'extra' that is the real selling point is you get the film in black and white (don't panic. the colour version is included as well). Watching the film in black and white is like watching a completely different movie. It's definetely more atmospheric.     If you like movies like 'The Fog' then you'll have great fun with this. Highly recommended.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|Just when I was about ready to consign them to the thumping, dance club slag heap, they double back and uncork a great one.  Terrific pop music, with dashes of the Beatles, St. Etienne and Stereolab.  A & E is a perfect pop song. It takes off, swoops and soars and stops on a dime.  Lush, gorgeous and addictive, this one's been in heavy rotation in my house since its release. Bravo.
0345452585|4.0|I was really enjoying my first read of a Kellerman novel about someone OTHER than Alex Delaware and his constant companion Detective Milo when, just as I got to the climax, I got a real shock:  \\"Hey, I've READ this book before!\\"  Sure enough, I distinctly remembered one small part of that scene and knew what would happen right after that.  And nothing else.  Not a single thing.  And I'm still scratching my head about when I read it the first time.  Still, it was quite a good read the second time, and that's a pretty good recommendation by itself . . . isn't it?<br /><br />At any rate, this book was good enough to make me want to read more of Kellerman's non-Alex Delaware novels, such as \\"Butcher's Theater\\" and \\"Twisted\\" . . . if only to discover that I've read those books before, too.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is my favorite Buble CD, so far. I really like all of his CD's. But, this one is my favorite. Excellent buy!
B000003489|3.0|The music has been with me for 3 or 4 decades; originally on lp and then CD reissues. This particular reissue is vastly inferior in terms of sound quality compared to an earlier CD reissue I have (the one with only 5 bonus selections added to the original release). Here, the piano sounds like it's played through a cheap amp, the sax is edgy but not clearer, the bass is loud but shapeless. Obviously classic music in a nice package but if you are at all sensitive about how music sounds, this particular reissue is one to avoid. This is the first review i've written for Amazon, so i feel strongly abut this.   Addendum: i wrote the above review in regard to a particular reissue that had a grey cover with the a small picture of the original cover in the corner. I've just purchased another copy; this one with 15 tracks and the entire original cover. It doesn't have the same sound problems described above. It sounds a bit better than my old copy but not drastically so. It is nice getting the bonus tracks added to the end of the original tracks  so one does not have to listen to many versions of the same song one after another.

B00008DDXC|4.0|The first two movies in the Harry Potter series are worth having. They both seem to keep that youthful curiosity that the books project. No matter your age the story is enjoyable and entertaining. Harry's family is part of the story not the consumming overtone of the whole wizardy thing like movies three and beyond are.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|There's a big difference between being edgy because that what you are and being edgy because that's what you want people to BELIEVE you are.  Erykah has moved from the former category to the latter with this disjointed and musically uninspired offering.  With the exception of Honey (which is o-kay---but sounds like something that should have been on her first album)), everything on New Amerykah just falls flat.  If you're an Erykah fan, skip this one.  Otherwise, you'll be just as disappointed as I was.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My daughter (an aspiring chef) and I found this story a magically inspirational tale. Chock full of life wisdom that one day I may just have to use in leadership development training.

B000VD5I94|5.0|Robocop is over 20 years old and even today many people will profess to loving this film, no matter what their age. This is one of the only films that I can sincerely say I can watch over and over again from start to finish and never get bored.<br /><br />The OCP (Omni Consumer Products) have been handed control of the local law enforcement of Detroit and their aim is to eradicate gang crime before construction begins on Delta City. A mega city that is set to bring Detroit into the present and make it a bustling metropolis. A presentation takes place at an OCP board meeting of a new crime fighting prototype, ED-209. The presentation goes horribly wrong as it executes a member of the board. Seeing this crisis, the young brash executive Bob Morton seizes his opportunity and pitches to the CEO the idea of Robocop for which the CEO accepts his proposal.<br />A newly assigned officer to the West Metro Precinct, Alex Murphy is sent out on his first assignment with his partner Anne. The pair are called to follow a van that is believed to have been involved in an armed robbery. The pair end up following the van to an old, abandoned steel mill and they discover it's the holdout for the most ruthless gang Detroit has seen. Murphy ends up alone in this steel mill with guns pointed at him and the leader of the gang, Clarence Boddicker wants him blown to pieces. They unload shots in to his chest and blow off one of his arms and ultimately leave him for dead.<br />In the hospital Murphy is pronounced dead and that gives Bob Morton his volunteer for the Robocop prototype. When Robocop is first introduced to the criminals, he makes an impact as he becomes simply unstoppable. Through flashbacks from his previous life as Murphy, Robocop goes looking for the people that killed him and tore apart his family. This leads him to untangle a web of corruption and deceit that is something that becomes quite emotional.<br /><br />This film is definitely something special and the cast for each role are perfect in every way. Peter Weller at the time was a relatively unknown actor but this is the type of career where one movie can be a man's biggest triumph. To some this would seem like a failed career, but to others Robocop being your biggest movie and becoming remembered through time as the actor who played Robocop that's something to be proud of. The real gem of a character in this film is Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. He plays the typical hard arsed individual who shows no remorse and no compassion, even for those who are part of his own gang. This is something that Kurtwood should be proud of and he gives us a character that I found to be truly menacing.<br /><br />All in all this is a spectacular film that I will always love and will always play a part in my Blu-Ray collection.very way.

B000002ITM|3.0|I had not been listening to testament for long, but this cd was such a let down from souls.  What we see here is a cd devoid of any emotion and trapped in a time where the band felt neglected and unappreciated in its own scene.  This is the one and only time Testament tried to apeal to the general masses.  My first listen to a video, electric crown and I was like wow this is interesting between all the grundge coming out but when the face of testament was behind this music it felt so uninspiring compared to their usual work.  Many fans claim that return to serinity was a great song, I call blasphamy...listen to the legacy and find where the heart and soul is.  This is by far the most disappointting LP that testament has ever released.  Go buy the gathering and feel where the band should be.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I really enjoyed this film as art, however I have my doubt on whether or not I enjoyed this film as a film.    The visuals were incredibly delectable, just look at the pictures on the Amazon page and other film websites and you'll have some feel for this.  Colors were swirling throughout the entire film and the composition of each and every scene were so perfectly thought out.  As a fan of the Beatles, the   choice of songs were terrific.  While many online would complain and argue that this song is missing or another should be taken away, generally the songs selected were from each era and nearly every album of the Beatles' oeuvre (that is the Beatles not the individual members after the break-up). The Director of this movie, Julie Taymor, did an amazing job at weaving these songs into a story about the love between two people, Jude and Lucy. While it is not a perfect weave, it is certainly, a heck of a feat. I also give her credit that she had the courage to even try it. I am not familiar with Taymor's work, however two of her films (Titus and Frida) have been on my \\"To Watch\\" list for a long time. I have heard these films are also visually stimulating.    Another point:  My girlfriend, who is not American and whose native language is not English, did not particularly like this film. She told me that it was \\"all over the place\\" and she could not follow it very well. I realized that where her \\"all over the place\\" was simply cultural references that she may not have known so much about. Such as the when Bono and the \\"Merry Pranksters\\" roll through Manhattan on their way to \\"Dr. Geary\\".  For people who know what all of this means, you too may have gotten all excited the moment you saw that swirling colored bus drive through the streets. I did. There was also scenes from Vietnam and references to dodging the draft. While, I did enjoy all this, I now believe that my girlfriend's thoughts are quite accurate, as Julie Taymor may have tried to put too much into this movieLast to think about, as I thought about the movie some more, I also realized and agreed with something else my girlfriend said. About half way through the movie, all I felt like I was really doing was waiting for the next song. \\"Which one will be next? Oh, this is great, but what will be next?\\" In this respect, and not surprisingly, the music of the Beatles outweighed the film itself.
B00000IIXH|5.0|I love Bruce and this CD is alot of old stuff that he has re-done but it ROCKS!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This DVD package is well worth the money to anyone that is interested in how we got to the Moon. I recommend it for young people because they were not here when the Apollo program was going on. I can remember watching Apollo 11 land, and Neil Armstrong's historic first step. I got this set so that I could send it on to my nephew. I gave it the maximum star rating, even though there are a few slow spots in some of the episodes. You won't be bored watching this DVD set.
B000Z1LOBI|4.0|This cd from the first track just catches you off guard...Chuck takes a different turn on the vocals and really pushes how heavy the band can be.  Low comes out to suprise you with who the band was.  While this coems out with an explosion with who the band could really be.  We read reviews of how good Alex Skolnick really is.  He is an amazing guitarist but james has really placed a mark on the band behind some of their hardest and heaviest hitting cds.  While the sheer talent and skill may not be their the heart is and I will listen to James any day over Alex.  The cd has all the riffs, power and heaviness of low, but brings a new element, chuck is now pushing his vox beyond the norm.  A large death metal aspect is added to this thrash metal band that adds pounds per pounds and punch for punch heavieness.  While still not my all time fav this lies near low and just under The Gathering.  Testament is a force to be dealt with and these are the cds that have made their mark.
B000BZ99WY|5.0|Another unfortunate reminder of a holocaust allowed to take place because of our Western-world's refusal to act; blatantly ignoring the fate of a people because of their 'lesser-than-us' status according to our 'civilized' mindset. \\"Never again.\\" How many more times will we hollowly say that? Romeo Dallaire's account of his harrowing uphill battle against international bureaucracy for a people he made it a moral duty to protect, is an example we can all truly learn from and live by. He bares all, opening the door for us to see into his post-war, tortured mind and soul. His humble question: \\"Did I do enough?\\" resonates deeply throughout this must-read.
B0010V4TZU|1.0|This sounds like Paul Simon. \\"Mansard Roof,\\" I'm talking about. Remember that song where Chevy Chase and Paul Simon are sitting together and Chevy is pretending to dance and sing the song? That is what I get from this album. It sounds like maybe one of the kids in the band has heard of Lord Invader, or has a general knowledge of some calypso melodies, but maybe was too afraid to push the song fully in that direction. In the end it winds up being a generally boring, album.    \\"Oxford Comma\\" is embarrassingly bad. Imagine if Belle and Sebastian had a different singer (that's a good thing, by the way), but he felt the need to sing about grammar, buildings in India and Lamas. Already this album is way too precious for its own good. I'd make a joke about a guy in \\"skinny jeans\\" and a sweater penning these lyrics during class, but I don't want to fall into the habit of repeatedly insulting the party responsible for this music so early on in our listening adventure. By the way, when did the lite synthesizer overtake the Smiths-style jangle-guitar in the battle for gayest sounding instrument?    Oh wait, here's that Smiths guitar sound. This number, \\"A-Punk\\" is really upbeat. Paul Simon is back singing his pretty heart out, but he might be trying to sing through a mouthful of food. Actually, it sounds like a too-hard attempt to meld Richie Valens with Rita Lee, but he's referencing the Hudson, the subway and Washington Heights. The punk-ish yelps that signal the song's coda are fragile enough to warrant plenty of unjust laughter. Here's the thing about these songs so far. They remind me of Orange Juice. I tried really hard to get into Orange Juice, but I wound up hating it. I'd much rather listen to Orange Juice than Vampire Weekend.    The Smiths guitar begins \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\", which instantly reminds me of these frat parties they used to have at Muhlenberg where dudes would wear Panama shorts and stupid collared t-shirts, and have Jimmy Buffet blaring through PA speakers outside their house. As I watched them playing beach volleyball on a makeshift beach and drinking Malibu rum straight from the bottle, I wondered if they thought they were accurately portraying life on foreign shores. That's the same feeling I get listening to this song. Maybe Vampire Weekend naively imagines \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" to sound like pure Afrobeat or Reggae. It doesn't. More dumb lyrical references to Louis Vuitton, Bennetton, and Peter Gabriel make me think these boys watch a lot of Family Guy.    \\"M79\\" is supposed to be, what, Mozart? \\"Campus\\" reminds me nothing of my own college experience (although maybe it would if I was the type of emo kid who dragged his feet and silently cursed passersby), and the Afro-pop-new-wave whatever you want to call it reeks of Spandau Ballet or one of those other early-'80s ultra-accessible new-wave band. The rest of the album doesn't really waver. \\"One\\" might be the worst song on this generally sub-par album.    Okay, so easily-digestible pop music isn't my preferred style of music. Still, it shouldn't be that difficult to see through the Vampire Weekend sheen to the ugly truth that this simply isn't good. Beat Happening were pretty weak and twee, but compared to Vampire Weekend they're a balls-to-the-wall rock band. This music is too slick, too studied, too affected. There are plenty of bands who tastefully borrow from world music without inserting it into otherwise preening collegiate pop songs. Antibalas and Cex Fucx do it better. I'd rather listen to those acts.    The Strokes were from New York, garnered a lot of buzz, and wore their influences on their sleeves, too...
076790382X|5.0|I am a big fan of Bill Bryson, and this book did not disappoint. It's full of his trademark witty observations and often outrageous, pee-your-pants funny humor.    The book is a collection of essays Bryson wrote for a newspaper after he had returned to the US after 20 years of living abroad. Each essay (2 to 4 pages) tackles a different topic of modern American life: the post office, television, holidays, airplane travel, to name just a few. He has such a unique view of things and events that we take for granted or consider mundane, especially when he compares life in the US to life in England. His style of writing is informal and conversational, which makes you feel like you're talking to an old friend.     A wonderful, sharp, insightful, and hilarious book, sure to keep you reading, laughing, and thinking for hours!

Release the album once, meter your audience, remix the album and more than double your sales. Big Machine Records is turning every stone!    Take a listen. Taylor's two biggest songs hit the 12 to 25 year old demographic with a bull's eye arrow. \\"Our Song\\" is catchy but pushes the sugar-is-sweet button really hard. The third time Taylor flips her voice singing `and you talk real slow, `cause it's late and your mama don't know...' you really want to reach for the `way too cute' switch. Want to really overdose? Watch the video. Get ready because here it comes!     \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" is just slightly more palatable. I don't know who Drew is, but he really should re-think his dating choices. Taylor and her friend Liz Rose nailed this one. It's all here in one song: Everything a teenage girl can lament to and relate to. You have to admit it is brilliant, but is it genuine? My standards may be really high, but when I listen to a song I have to buy the fact that the performer feels something about what they are singing. Just a little. C'mon!    I'm looking forward to Taylor's brand new fall release. She is teaming up with ultra-hot Colbie Caillat and Big and Rich's John Rich to write the songs. You know the production will be first rate. Let's hope she can mature and season her act to compliment her potential. I don't want Wonder Bread. I want the real thing. Let's hope Nashville's oven bakes Taylor's next one well. They're making me really hungry for something good.
B00132D808|2.0|Let me start by saying that the music itself in this album is very good, if you forget this is Panic at the disco. I was extremely disappointed to hear such an original band go out of their way to sound completely UNoriginal. This is a totally different direction for them, however it is not a different direction from anything else out there, hence my disappointment. I do not suggest buying this album if you expect that energy and original sound from their debut album. I do suggest buying this album if you need a substitute for sleep medication.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Actors Thomas Jane, Toby Jones, Laurie Holden and Andre Braugher all topline this moody and exceptionally well-crafted staging of one of Stephen King's most time-honored tales. Having read the short novel a great many years ago, I initially approached this film with brimming trepidation. But, thankfully, all my fears were quickly allayed. Finally, we have a horror film that isn't a remake or an assembly-line style sequel! With that said, I cannot nor will I ever fully understand the scattershot negativity this is receiving. Aside from the film's closing moments, which I quite honestly do not abhor, this sterling adaptation follows King's original story almost perfectly.    We begin the movie with aspiring artist, David Drayton. He, his young son, and all his neighbors and friends soon find themselves trapped within a bustling supermarket the very day following a vicious thunderstorm that has collapsed trees and power lines throughout Castle Rock. With this natural catastrophe comes another that is not all that natural or, for that matter, hospitable. A thick impenetrable mist has engulfed the once inviting landscape, concealing nightmarish monstrosities beyond imagination that live only to maim, dismember, and murder. The frightened townspeople rally together to fend off this unearthly onslaught, completely unaware of the human monster, brilliantly portrayed by Marcia Gay Harden, who is subsequently corrupting and dividing their rapidly dwindling number from within.    That colorful breakdown basically represents the main outline to King's story. Everything else, by now, has unfortunately become the widely-disputed stuff of common knowledge. Varying shades of disgruntled fans have already voiced their harsh disapproval of Director Frank Darabont's new and darker ending while others, like me, found it brilliant and altogether daring. But what should be noted is that King, himself, enthusiastically preferred the film's ending far and above his own written one. \\"The Mist,\\" incidentally, had been Darabont's pet-project for countless years, long before he even brought \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" before cameras. It was an obvious labor of love that he meticulously addresses within the 2-Disc Collector's Edition's expansive supplementals. And that particular edition, let me just say, is a certifiable must-own! Aside from the feature film on Disc One and the diverse plethora of behind-the-scenes extras, the viewer is also treated to a complete black and white alternate transfer on Disc Two that Darabont maintains the studio discouraged him from releasing. Younger people these days, as Darabont reflects in his monologue, do not often award black and white its proper due. That may certainly remain a matter of contention for some. But for me, personally, experiencing this movie in black and white is tantamount to reliving all the classic monster movies I grew up watching every Saturday afternoon. It gives King's narrative a whole new feel and adds even more atmosphere to what was already there.    I couldn't possibly be any happier with this film. It was ever so much the faithful adaptation I had long hoped it would be and proves beyond any doubt, at least to me, that Stephen King still has what it takes to illicit a genuine scare from his fans.
B00005N6KG|5.0|In my opinion this is what headphones should be.  They do not fall out when you are jogging, they are comfortable, and they sound good.  Thanks sony for  an excellent product.  I will buy these again!

B0010X73ZG|5.0|Frank Darabont, the man who brought The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile to the big screen, adapts Stephen King once again with The Mist; which ranks as one of the very best adaptations of the horror author's works.  Thomas Jane (The Punisher, Deep Blue Sea) stars as David Drayton, a movie poster artist living in Maine who, along with his young son (Nathan Gamble) is trapped with other survivors in a supermarket when a mysterious, deadly mist rolls into town; with something even deadlier lurking inside the fog.  Making matters even worse are the biblical ramblings of Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes this is a sign from God, and soon demands that sacrifices be made.  Combining old school horror, social commentary, monster-flavored shocks, and more commentary elements of religious fanatiscism; Frank Darabont has managed to craft a modern day horror classic that does not disappoint.  Jane gives one of the best performances of his career, and though Marcia Gay Harden's character doesn't get much sympathy, she is very effective in her role regardless.  With wonderful CGI creature, monster, and makeup effects from the good folks at KNB, a great cast that also includes Silent Hill's Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, Andre Braugher, William Sadler, Alexa Davalos, and Jeffrey DeMunn, and one of the most unforgettable and unsettling endings in a mainstream movie in recent memory; The Mist isn't only one of the best King adaptations ever filmed, but one of the best horror movies released in quite some time.  All in all, whether you are a King fan or just a horror fan in general, you should definitely see The Mist.  You will not regret it.

The proof they say, is in the pudding, and the taste is all there. I made the peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips for my daughter's kindergarten class. The children loved them. The chocolate cake is fantastic. No eggs, no dairy. It is amazing that you can make such moist, decadent desserts without the traditional ingredients we all grew up with and never miss a thing. AND in these tight economic times, it is great to know that one box of egg-replacer equals about 114 eggs! Not only do her recipes deliver, but her tips are very useful. It is like she is standing in the kitchen with you. Patrick-Goudreau also helps you stock your pantry, and plainly demystifies \\"vegan\\" labels. What does it really mean? By switching to egg and dairy alternatives, you are being more compassionate toward animals, you can save money, and you could be eating a healthier dessert! Back to the main point: These recipes are delicious. Your tastebuds will love every morsel. Patrick-Goudreau has created the right desserts that prove you do not need eggs and cow's milk for a sweet treat.  This is baking for the 21st century and beyond. Give this cookbook a try. It will be a star in your culinary library. Happy baking!
B00005JM02|5.0|Got this used DVD, it works great! Good delivery time, would definitely do business here again.
0452289963|5.0|I am reading this with another friend and it has brought us both to two different places within ourselves.  It gently guides you into areas of your mind that you have not given much thought to before, and you'll come out a better person for reading it, no matter what your personal religious beliefs.<br /><br />It is definitely not for those who cannot suspend their personal religious dogma long enough to read it though.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I heard Like a Star and loved it and decided to check out the CD. I had never heard of the artist before so I was still on the fence. After listening to some of the tracks on her myspace page, I went out and brought the CD. I love EVERY Song on it. From start to finish and then repeat it again. I cant list my favorites because they all are.
0751529818|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a \\"final thesis\\" between a young man and his old, beloved college professor who is diagnosed with a deadly, unforgiving illness called ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.      This book made Morrie's death much more valuable by making it a life lesson for people. People fear death and let it take over them instead of preparing for it and cherishing the moments they have to live. Morrie is only human, and he must have had his fears as well, but Morrie was strong, and he used his death to teach one more class, to share the experience to the public and give others the message of life and death.        Morrie died painfully, but he didn't die lonely. He was a great teacher, husband, father, and friend. He had many loved ones who watched over him. He didn't die without meaning either. He left the world a better place.             After reading this book, I was deeply moved, and I've thought a lot about life and death. I'm still young and I don't really know much about the two broad subjects. After reading the book twice, I truly believe this book is the answer to life.            Life is a long, tiring trip and death is like your last stop to home sweet home and knowing that you've been there before.              No matter how busy or how much your life is filled with earthly activities, this book reminds us of the simple gifts we have in life and to cherish the loved ones. After I finished the book, I've been able to appreciate the little things in life, such as the color of leaves, the sounds of birds chirping, the laughter of loved ones, and the simple daily activities that I am able to do.             This is the type of book that can be read over and over and you'll still find more valuable hidden meanings and lessons in the text. It is beautifully written and simple, yet contains much complex lessons. This book touches your heart and soul and gets your mind thinking about the values of life. This is a book that never leaves your soul after you read it. Trust me on that.     **I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT**
140120306X|5.0|I've been a fan of Alan Moore's work since the 80's.  It was so much fun  reading Miracleman, Swamp Thing, Watchmen etc. as they came out new each month.    I have recently re-introduced myself to comics and have enjoyed a lot of great work that has been produced over the past 20 years or so.  I have read the first two volumes of 'League' and must say that this third volume is not only the best one - but one of the best comic-reading experiences I've ever had.    It's different.  It's new - it invites the reader to explore a story from several different angles/mediums and thus enjoy a story in a new way.  And really, it's a celebration of fantasy, science fiction and anything in literature that has pushed the envelope, from a thematic or story-telling perspective.  The final poem at the end is a declaration of this celebration, and I defy you to not read it and smile.    Alan Moore, Kevin O'Neill and Ben Dimagmaliw (who is the wonderful colorist and deserves his share in credits for this book) have continued on with the adventures of Mina, Quartermain and company in comic book fashion.    They also include a serialized comic that was popular in England, sort of a picture-book approach (The Life of Orlando, which is a highlight and is intended as a reference to be used throughout the novel), a 'new' play by Shakespeare (Alan knocks it out of the park here, lots of fun), Beatnik style writing ala Ginsberg and Kerouac, and a merry-making ending that is in 3-D (this is the League in the Fabulous Fifties, after all!) and features an inspired and heartfelt poem at the end.  In fact, I would say the poem is as heartfelt as anything I've ever read from Moore - and all you fans out there know that 'heartfelt' is a word not often used to describe his writing.    This is a story to read in several sittings, like a long novel.  It's to be savored .. you can go back, look at something hinted at earlier, etc.  Like Watchmen, there are a number of 'easter eggs' throughout this work, as and allusions abound.  It's a graphic novel for folks who love reading! Especially if you love reading classic Science Fiction and Fantasy.    I applaud Alan Moore for making this and hopes he keeps stretching the medium and possibilities even farther.  Alan - if you're reading this - good job!  Keep going!
B00132D808|2.0|When I was at a store once, I heard \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\" playing over their radio.  I went home, figured out it was by a group called Panic! At the Disco, then went back out and bought their debut album, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\"  And it was good.  They managed to set themselves apart from other bands in their genre with witty, sarcastic lyrics and a sound that was like a mix of rock and vaudeville.    We've waited a while for their second album, \\"Pretty. Odd.\\"  Was it worth the wait?  Not particularly.  It might not be a bad album if it was a debut effort from some other band, but it's not, so you can't help but be disappointed that it's not on the same level as \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\"  I'm not sure if it's even the same genre.    Gone are the clever lyrics, replaced by tripe about the weather and summer.  And the sound?  They threw their old sound out the window, and decided to replace it with a sound that's less homage to the Beatles and more rip-off.  The Beatles are certainly a worthwhile band to be inspired by, if you can do it well.  PATD, apparently, can't.  \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" couldn't be cheesier if it was a recording of the songs from groups that go to elementary schools and sing about how it's cool not to do drugs.  Albums like this make you want to roll up a newspaper, whack the band member on their noses, and say, \\"No!  That's a bad Panic at the Disco!\\" it the hopes that they won't do anything like that ever again.
0375805613|5.0|This book allows the reader to have fun with the story too.<br />A great book.
0807126071|4.0|First of all I want to say that it's definitely recommendable.   Somehow the knowledge of the premature death of the author (before the book was published) gives this book an eerie dimension. It is a comedy, a very good one at that, but behind this facade lingers the notion that the author couldn't accept society the way it was. Perhaps even the reason he committed suicide.   But it could be my imagination, and just be an all out comedy.. Either way, definitely a book worth reading. Superbly written, with a main character you will never forget. Oh, and for those who care about such things (like me): the limited edition is lovely, with some B&W pictures of the author, and the places described in the book in the middle.
6304765231|3.0|I love the Crow, great movie and the like.  But when I bought it, it said that the condition was \\"Very Good.\\"  They couldn't be further from the truth.  The DVD is so scratched that I can't watch past the first 3 minutes.  Even skipping chapters doesn't help!<br />Again, I recommend the movie, but find a different distributor.
B00132D808|2.0|I do not think this band is very talented but I will admit that the first time I heard their first album, shortly after it was released, I was hooked.  It is very catchy and I could not stop listening to it.  I was hoping the new album would be the same, more catchy songs which is what they seem to be best at but they ended up trying too hard to be something they are not.  As I was listening to the album I kept waiting to get hooked but it never happened.  A couple of good songs but overall, nothing like the first album (in a bad way).
0061122416|4.0|I finished The Alchemist in two sittings - it's that short. But there's a lot of good stuff packed into this story that makes it an excellent read.    The book is about a Spanish shepherd boy who has a dream of finding treasure buried beside the Great Pyramids. He sets out on his journey by crossing into Africa and traveling with several different companions. I personally love the setting of the desert, with the camels and the Arabian marketplace and all, so this book has some great imagery. The plot is intriguing and the characters are by far the high point: they are all very unique and interesting. And the ending had a turn that I thought was well executed.    The tale is designed so to present the author's ideas about the nature of the Universe, and how all things are connected, etc. I wouldn't call it profound or anything, but I liked the way it was woven into the story. I'd much prefer to read a narrative about the Laws of the Universe than, say, The Secret (which presents many of the same ideas but reads like a how-to guide), so this was well done. Even if you aren't big on some of the philosophy there is a lot presented here and I think there is something for everyone to take away.    My only complaints: this book was translated from Portuguese and so the variety in word choice is a little lacking. I think it could have been more poetic either in the native language, or if the translation was handled by someone else. Also, if you don't really buy into the philosophy presented, it gets very blatant at some points and interferes with the plot. Still, I think for such a short read it's a very good book and I'd definitely recommend it.
B00068TJM6|4.0|I am writing this after using the watch for over an year. This is a steal for the price I paid(235$).  Pros :   excellent build(shining steel, scratch proof glass)  real good water resistant  excellent stopwatch  Cons :  heavy and fat(thickness is 12mms)  Other than the above Seiko watches are always very well known for their technology, craftmanship and build quality. So highly reccommended
0761944524|5.0|The book is excellent in all ways: easy to read, fun to read, easy to understand.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I rented this on a whim, I didn't even know there was a book first, so I watched it without prejudice.  I ended up loving it.  Emile Hirsch did a fantastic job as the real life character, \\"Alexander Supertramp\\". He embodied the character and carried the movie.  I think he reason why I loved the movie so much is because I identify with Alexander Supertramp's belief system, except not to the extreme. I go through stages of wanting to give up on people and \\"soceity\\", but I'm not willing to isolate and rebel against something that is stronger than the powers that be.  Point in case, he died for his beiefs and it seemed he regreted some of the core of what he was trying to prove to himself with the scribble of a quote he enscribed in one of his novels \\"happiness only real when shared\\".  I think he realized when he was near death that isolation is not the answer.  But his journey was a self chosen path that I'm sure was his destiny, and in fact inspired many people he came in contact with.  In hindsight, I believe that in his mind and soul, his beilief was worth dying for.  It's rare to find that quality in human beings, so I commend him for that, but I disagree with some of his bizarre actions that led to his death.  There were also some contridictions to his core belief system in regards to \\"money\\".  The practical side of me asked questions like \\"if you are so against the money system, why did you rely on other people's money that you came into contact with, which is borderline \\"using people\\" in my mind.  You can't escape the fact we all need money to survive in the end.  Aside from all the philosophical aspects of the film, I thought Sean Penn did a fantastic job directing. I also loved the music by Eddie Veder. On the weird front, there were some bizarre moments like the \\"apple scene\\" and the danish couple encounter and the MC Hammer song?  I was like \\"whoa, ok....\\".  Overall I felt like I was on the journey with him, it was an incredible but tedious ride.
B00132D808|3.0|I honestly wouldn't waste my time writing a helpful review, when \\"Matthew W. Paradise 'nutmegs'\\" stole the words out of my mouth.  Every point that was made in that review, I strongly would like to emphasize.  The old style was more suited for me, I suppose.  If only they had kept some constancy, instead of implementing this new method.
1932100385|5.0|I've always heard great things about this book and the more I read the more I can see my life changing.  The research they have done on animal protien and it's link to disease is facinating and a real wake-up call. I have reevaluated my views on what a healthy diet actually is.  If you're the type of person that wants to lead a healthy and happy life and help others to do so as well, then you will thoroughly enjoy this book.
B000000H4A|5.0|10 stars all the way!!!! Man, this is a great album!!  A perfect answer to Mercyful Fate's untimely demise.  Only to be re-UN-born in this eloquent, masterful, brilliantly produced collection of searing and haunting tracks.  A new line-up, a new look, tighter sound, better production, man, it's all here.  Every track is great-- 'Dressed in White' may be the only filler on here, and it's still very well done.  But from the minute you put it on, you discover that inner primal darkness coming alive through operatic wailing vocals, and fearsome, leather winged guitars.  After Mercyful Fate, this was definitely King's best, it's follow up- 'Abigail' was good, but nothing could even come close in the years to come... It's as if this album was already written eons ago, like some ancient tome waiting to be discovered once again...If you like Dark and Heavy, then come see what you've been missing.
B00005NKK8|2.0|What a mistake.  I heard the Forest Gump Suite and it was pretty.  The CD is a compilation of old radio music,  My fault, should have paid attention to the listed contents
B000065BPB|5.0|I am loving the quality of these headphones... I used to have some sony ones that were similarly priced... they are NO comparison to these. professional build and quality. I love the sound output and you can feel the bass as well.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I absolutely loved this two disc CD set! I listen to it all the time and when I first got it home it was the only music I listened to for about 3 weeks straight. After watching the movie the music is so much more meaningful and when you listen through the soundtrack you feel as if you are watching the movie even if you are just on your way to work in your car. I really enjoyed all the renditions of the Beatles songs and it successfully whetted my appetite for more Beatles music.
B00132D808|5.0|Let me be the first to say when I listened to Pretty Odd I thought it was just that, odd... Being so different from `Fever' caught me off guard. But after another listen I was hooked. Its true I miss the pace and beats from the first cd, but when a band can evolve its sound in a positive way you have to respect that. And who can complain about Ryan's amazing voice? He should have been on the first cd...  So if your going to buy this cd realize the band is heading in a new direction and don't hate them for it. I read one review that said 99% of Panic fans won't like this album. Let me be the first to assure you that's not correct. And I'm excited to see where they go from here...

0767817478|5.0|I enjoyed Godzilla 1998 during it's initial movie theater run. Yeah, I too was a little surprised by the new look of the creature, but I was sure glad it didn't look like a guy in an overstuffed rubber suit using the tail to rock back and forth on his heels...I'll leave that to the Godzilla purists who are much better at suspending disbelief. Don't get me wrong, I thought the original Godzilla movie was great, but I was five years old at the time!    Godzilla 1998 was scheduled for a late March 2008 release on Blu-ray, and then Sony postponed it with a TBA. I think it will look fantastic in High-Def...if or when it ever gets here.
630460291X|5.0|This is an awesome movie. I owned it on VHS, but have been trying to replace all my VHS tapes for DVDs. The VCR has been gone for over 2 years now.
B00132D808|4.0|Very different move for the band.  While the last album was amazing-- but produced to sound ... synthetic. It was a surreal sound; appealing to the listeners that felt the music of the current time was not quite reaching out to them. Comparisons to Fall Out Boy are ridiculous in my opinion, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is a unique album that reached unprecedented, while not extraordinary, levels in music.    With that in mind, \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" is a strange step of the band to take. All this talk of true fans, first album hits, and sophomore slumps are a bit overdone-- this is a step in the direction these artists desired to move. While all the songs are not stellar, very few albums contain a complete set of brilliant songs. The beat is definitely slower and the tone is far more optimistic... they aren't straying from their roots, they are simply expanding their horizons in music.    It comes down to this. As an album, you mustn't buy this if you want \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\" But then again, you mustn't expect \\"Slippery When Wet\\" from Bon Jovi's latest album. Each album defines itself, not the artist. At the end of Panic at the Disco's career-- that's when the evaluation of what kind of genre they should be placed in will be assessed.     On a personal note, I found it amusing that I found that a lot of people who claimed the original album was a waste of time and money thoroughly enjoyed this \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" whereas die-hard Panic! at the Disco fans were more interested in how they dropped the \\"!\\" from their name instead of recognizing how evident the change from their cynicism of society to an introverted analysis of how much their friendship and band means to them is witnessed in this album.     Not only is the band avoided using lead singer Brendan Urie as a frontman as more contemporary bands have, but each band member is clearly more involved in this project.     And as a side note. Watch the \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" music video if you can't see how much these recording artists are enjoying their music and each other.
0345494768|5.0|I got this for my 14 year old son and myself. I can't get over how cool this book is !! So much behind the scenes info. I worked at a theater for the initial release of Star Wars and this book gives me information about a movie that I thought I already knew everything about.  Buy it !!!
B0000027RL|5.0|The great things about this album have already been said by the other 728 reviewers.  What I'd like to add is the relevance of this album almost 17 years later.  Go and listen to \\"Evenflow\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Jeremy\\", and \\"Why Go\\".  It's as if Pearl Jam foresaw the world as it is now.  Columbine, Virginia Tech, and many other school shootings happened well after \\"Jeremy\\" was released.  That song long foretold of the consequences of alienating your children and classmates.  \\"Why Go\\" and \\"Evenflow\\" - teenage mental illness is on the rise in epidemic proportions, and it's often not discussed openly.  \\"Alive\\" - families splintered by violence and divorce are certainly just as relevant today as they were in 1991.  Ten's thematic elements blend together beautifully to illustrate the world we live in now.  The message is even more relevant today - when we don't listen to our youth and alienate them, we are the ones that pay price.
B00004XONN|3.0|Almost everyone has heard the story of how Radiohead shocked the world with this album. After releasing the hugely successful rock album OK COMPUTER in 1997, the band went on a massive world tour and then a long creative hiatus. When KID A appeared in 2000, their sound had moved away from straight-up rock to a peculiar mix of their previous style and electronic music. The sounds of the traditional quartet are expanded with sequencers, vocoders, and a brass troupe, and even an ondes martenot.<br /><br />Lyrically the album continues to some extent the theme of the alienation and existential crises that our modern technological society produce. \\"The National Anthem\\" treats the pressure of urban population, and \\"Idioteque\\" alludes to the cruelty of global capitalism. Indeed, both musically and in terms of the album art KID A could be said to be OK COMPUTER's dark side. However, the cohesiveness of this theme is weakened by several instrumentals, which are little more than electronic noodling, and the final \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\", an out of place ballad.<br /><br />Of all their albums with OK COMPUTER and after, KID A may have dated badly. The electronic sounds of Aphex Twin, Autechre and Boards of Canada which inspired this change in style were being touted as the future of music a decade ago, but IDM has faded and rock music is still standing strong. I get much less out of the album today than I did back in the day. Nonetheless, there are worthy moments in KID A, and a maturity in the songwriting and performances that, if lesser than the most part of their late albums, is still preferable to PABLO HONEY or THE BENDS.
0345333853|5.0|This book is a wonderful telling of the tale of King Arthur and his knights from the perspective of the women in this classic. MZB totally \\"did it\\" for me and I ran through this book twice. I had heard many tell of this books' marvels and so I had to get it for myself in order to believe it. I would definately reccomend this book to any woman who is open spiritually (as this book does have some Pagan themes and can be somewhat against Christianity) and to anyone who is a lover of Arthurian tales but needs a new or different prespective of this story.<br /><br />As I stated before, this book is told from the prespective of women, however there is so much going on throughout the story, that the prespective sometimes switches to the male characters as well. MZB includes all aspects of this legend by telling of the beginings of Morgain, how she came to be reared in Avalon, how she fell in love with Lancelet and how lancelet fell for his best friend's wife and queen, Gwenyifar. There are many other tangles and some characters who are new yet centrally important to the story, however this is not a complication to the storyline. It is more like added spice! There is the memorable Merlin and of course Morgain's mother and sister. We get to know and care for each of the characters in Morgain's life as well as most in Arthur's circle as well. This story does end somewhat sadly, however that is also life. There are a great many lessons learned at the end that you find yourself wishing all throughout the story many of the characters would have learned at the beginning.<br /><br />This is a long story, but it's pace is perfect and not at all slow. MZB has a gift for writing and has crafted a masterpiece that enables one to be completely soaked into the story and become \\"involved\\" with the characters welfare. This is a MUST for the bookshelf.<br /><br />*I am aware that the spelling of the character's names are wrong however I don't even have my copy with me as it is on loan at the moment... which shows just how much this book is loved.*s just how much this book is loved.*
0393057240|5.0|Sure the movie is fantastic, pretty much everyone will agree on that, but to really get the full story one has to read the book. Yes, as alot of people will say, it is hard to understand at first because of the dialect, but Welsh is a master at the Scottish dialect, and to truly be absorbed \\"intae\\" the story, you have to have that key component.<br /><br />Welsh brilliantly combines all emotions here over a rollercoaster ride through the drug scene in Scotland.  An absolute must read for any book lover.  Read \\"Filth\\" also.  Welsh is flippin great.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|The start is good, the middle keeps you in there, the ending will jolt your soul.....That's all I got.  Unbelievable....    Oh yeah, good effects and pretty dang good acting.  A must see and one of the most thought provoking horrors I've seen in a long time.....Just see this for God's sake.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I came to Firefly late, and it's probably just as well. Considering how much I enjoyed this, I'd have been crushed if I'd got hooked and then they killed it.  I went into my first viewing of Firefly knowing that this was it.<br /><br />God's how I wish it wasn't!<br /><br />I'm a big sci-fi fan, got hooked on Star Trek back in the sixties, then all the spin-offs and movies.  Moved on to BSG (Old and new) and love them both, as well as Stargate SG1, and many more.<br /><br />I own exactly none of the Trek shows at this moment, none of the Stargate seasons (Atlantis or SG1), and most of the new BSG.  Firefly I had to have.<br /><br />Joss Whedon sure knows how to write!  \\"Burn the land, boil the seas, you can't take my sky from me!\\"  or my Firefly!!!<br /><br />I'm a confirmed Browncoat now...  Just wish there was more!
0066620996|4.0|This book is a must-have but only because it is a concise summary of a much more detailed work by Peter Drucker.
1582701709|5.0|I have read the book about three times over, while it has helped me with self improvement in the areas of health and mind. Before I have to admit that I was depressed over things, while taking drugs to help cope. It was Rhonda who has helped me realize that negativity is a real force in this realm we live in and the only way to combat it is to be positive. The author is an angel and I highly recommend anyone to read this because it has saved me from myself.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|I am a big fan of Denzel Washington but don't like to go to the movies. So I order them online. This was a gripping and thrilling movie. Very well produced and directed!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Very fantastique story .  It was with a great pleasure than I saw this movie.  And the most for me, there are french language and in my country, this DVD doesn't exist.  Donc pour ceux que cela interesse, le DVD est en français (non signalé lors de l'achat)il faut juste dézonner son lecteur pour le voir en france
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Don't let the title fool you. This gal has one powerfull voice and I love her style. I had never heard of her until I saw her on the Today Show. I ordered the CD the next day and was not disappointed. Play it at least once a day!

B000UAE7RW|5.0|its a timeless classic and must for movie buffs! it also arrived in great condition and a very timely manner.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I loved this musical so much that I had to buy a CD. This musical was one of the funniest musicals I've ever seen.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|This film vaguely reminded me of the 1957 production \\"Abandon Ship\\" with Tyrone Power. Totally different locale and genre, but still a character study of people in distress.    The irony is that the ending was changed from the original story by  Stephen King.    Not good.    You don't put the audience through 2 hours of suspense and end it all with pure drek. Unless, of course, you wish to emulate a Hitchcockian twist which in this case is severely lacking in style and format.    Sir Alfred had a knack of dividing the good guys and the bad guys  with \\"just dues\\" set accordingly.    Sorry, this is a waste of time.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I would say that in most cases remakes are not as good as the original but in this case I have seen them both and must say that Julia and Harrison make a great pair!
B000Y7U98C|4.0|This movie was very amazing!!! completely went under the radar when it was in theatres. the plot is pretty fast movie and it is def exciting. my only gripe is that the villian in the movie is a little too over-the-top. asides from that, this movie has everything that a very good sci-fi needs. do yourself a favor (if your a sci-fi movie buff) and watch this, rent it if you have to!
B00132D808|5.0|I love this album. It is unique and interesting. I listen to it while studying or reading and it is perfect. The songs are cmplex and interesting too so they should have good repeat listen appeal. It should be noted that I would only give their first album 2 1/2 stars as I found nothing too interesting with all the techno dacne beats they mixed in there. I suppose if you love AFYCSO you might not enjoy this album but other music fans may just love it. Also everyone quit saying they ripped off the beatles, I can hear a few similarities but I dont feel like I am listening to a beatles album at all and that would be the sign of an effective rip-off. If that is your opinion you might as well goo around reveiwing every band that uses power chords and distortion as Nirvana rip-offs. Anyways its pretty good and I would certainly recomend it to most.
B0015KO52S|5.0|When I first heard the opening riffs of \\"Consolers to the Lonely\\",  I thought, \\"definitely a Jack White (or White Stripes with a full band) record.\\" While this is definitely not a bad thing, I was not necessarily looking forward to another Stripes record. I'd probably consider myself more of a Brenden Benson fan, and since there's not lots of him out there, I want every bit that I can get. As a fan of either, or both,  you will not be disappointed. It may not be immediately evident, but the record is a White Stripes record with the pop grandeur of Brendon Benson (circa The Alternative to Love, maybe One Mississippi), combining both in the best possible way. A true collaboration, with artists this talented (including Patrick Keeler and Jack Lawrence, of course), we are very lucky. No track to track run down, if you are a fan of any or all, get it, give it some time if you need it, you will not be disappointed.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This is perhaps Ryan Adams' greatest album so far. It showcases his ability to write and perform a wide variety of music. Some reviewers here say that \\"New York, New York\\" and \\"Firecracker\\" are great, but then he \\"loses focus.\\"  They obviously expected the entire album to be rocking and upbeat. With Ryan Adams, that is a mistake. Some of the best tracks on here are the slow ones. The best thing about this album is that there are songs on it for every kind of mood.
B000002KKD|5.0|The B-52's *****<br /><br />The fact that an album by The B-52's was the most shocking album of 1979, at a time when Punk bands like The Damned and The Sex Pistols were king is shocking in it's self. But you have to realize it was either the lour angst of punk, the mellow sounds of soft rock, or the dance-able grooves of disco, and then The B-52's....a band unlike any other.<br /><br />The still to this day infectiousness of 'Rock Lobster' with it's killer guitar riff to the club friendly '52 Girls' and could have been a Cramps song 'lava' alone make this album worth while.<br /><br />From Schinders' signature nasally voice and the jangly guitar, to the patent bee-hive hairdo's The B-52's were the greatest rock gimmick that never meant to happen and this, their debut album is a testament to that.
1416550518|5.0|The House at Riverton is the story of Grace Bradley, who was once a servant at Riverton Manor and who became privy to some of its secrets.  Now a resident in a nursing home, Grace reflects on her life at Riverton, prompted by letter and visits from a movie producer.<br /><br />The House at Riverton is a compelling story, with elements of Bronte's Jane Eyre, Du Maurier's Rebecca, McEwan's Atonement and Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.  I could not put it down and looked forward to coming home from work so I could read more of the story.  It's a rich story, well-written and with well-developed characters.
B00122M2QU|4.0|'Inflikted'is part punk,part thrash, part groove album with a very raw (yet polished) production thanks in part to ex-Soulflier Logan Mader behind the board. Unfortunatly 'Inflikted' comes off more like Soulfly instead of Sepultura. With most of the tracks written by Max and to some degree Joe from Gorjira this album just sounds like the next incarnation of Soulfly. Sure there are some thrashy elements and great solos(way to g o Mark) but between these spots the album drags and begins to sound the same as we've heard from Max for the past several years....yawn. Rex Brown even makes an appearance on one track as well as Ritchie Cavalera on another. Iggor's drumming is very solid as it is simplistic. You can feel the vibe from the brothers Cavalera as it is evident on such tracks as 'Sanctuary', 'Dark Ark','Hex'and the punked out title track 'Inflikted' all of which are solid. But the one thing that continues to hold Max back is his very limited vocabulary. He has the same vocal delivery as Soulfly's S/T. So you are kind of hearing the same thing over and over. His same lyrics just keep getting regurgitated over and over again....this fact is undenyable. And Max can't create an album without counting off in at least one song....1..2..3..4.  sure I support them and I think it's great that the founders of Brasil's greatest export are reunited but to think that this is a return to form for them is a stretch.
B0000DD79B|5.0|The product arrived at the specified time that was given to me when I ordered the CD. There was No damage to the CD as it was well packaged and the songs are great to listen to and bring back good memories.

B0013N8VWW|5.0|there is little to add for a die-hard fan .. always great to see another album release.  This one is more like the older style, which I loooooove.  Thanks Bryan for all the music and Happy Birthday to your mom!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Words can't explain how amazing this album is. I just got the new Pretty Odd cd Panic put out today. It pales in comparison to this album. This is what Panic AT THE Disco should still be, a fast paced, insane, weird, crazy band! Here's the songs on the album: They're all great, but the 5 out of 5 ones are the best no doubt-    1. Introduction-3/5    2. The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage-5/5    3. London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines-4/5    4. Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks-4/5    5. Camisado-5/5    6. Time to Dance-5/5    7. Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off-4/5    8. Intermission-3/5    9. But It's Better If You Do-4/5    10. I Write Sins Not Tragedies-5 million/5    11. I Constantly Thank God for Esteban-5/5    12. There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of It Yet-5/5    13. Build God, Then We'll Talk-5/5
B000RG1NW6|5.0|A brief, but life-changing interlude between a newly married couple  dealing with the disparity between the unspoken assumptions, expectations, and naive perceptions held by each spouse, and the reality and frightening intimacy of marriage. The characters are sharply drawn and we feel that we know them better than they know each other. The powerful impact of repressed and hypocritical societal norms at the cusp of the sexual \\"revolution\\" creates a context that underscores and intensifies the emotions and behaviors of the couple. Mcewan is a gifted and skilled writer, and a personal favorite. Life can change in a moment in Mcewan's world and the consequences ripple and unfold in amazing ways.
B00012FXB8|5.0|It would seem that some \\"fans\\" of the Alien series would have preferred it if Hicks, Newt, and Ripley had ended up becoming one big, happy Alien-killing Brady Bunch.    Thankfully, Alien 3 ended any possibility of that nonsense.      Released in 1992, Alien 3 was an international success, but a critical failure, mainly because it was a dark, downbeat, and nihilistic horror film as opposed to a fun blow-em-up.  The exciting and simplistic approach of James Cameron in Aliens is replaced by a gothic, methodical, and apocalyptic approach by David Fincher, who is much more of an visual artist than Cameron ever was or will be.    The fact is, Alien 3 restores the horror, cynicism, and hopelessness of Ridley Scott's Alien, all of which which was lost in Aliens; don't get me wrong, Aliens is an incredible film, but it was very much an action film that disregarded the subtext of Alien.  Cameron dumbed down the Alien design considerably, turning them from psychosexual nightmarish beings (from the mind of H.R. Giger) into basically big insects who work for a Queen.    The acting by Charles Dance, Charles S. Dutton, Brian Glover, and Danny Webb is superior to anyone in Aliens.  Alien 3 is populated by complex, flawed individuals, not the cliched (but very likable) grunts of Aliens.  Weaver delivers another fantastic performance as Ripley, the lone female who is tasked with turning a prison full of (deeply religious) murderers, criminals, and deviants into fighters willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.  That alone makes Alien 3 a much deeper film than Aliens.    Alien 3 is rife with subtext, like Alien.  Themes of religion, self-sacrifice, corporate dominance, fatalism, and objectification of humans is prevalent in every frame.  No, the characters are not likable, but they are surely fascinating.      The camerawork, visuals, sounds, and action sequences are innovative and top-of-the-line.  The first-person perspective of the Alien as it chases down the inmates in the film's climax is astounding.  This is truly an art film designed as a slasher movie, like the first Alien.    Alien 3 is not without flaws, but thankfully- much like Blade Runner- the film is finally getting the respect it deserves.  It's a shame that there are still some close-minded \\"fans\\" who hate Alien 3 for killing off two needless characters (yes, admit it, Hicks and Newt were fun in Aliens, but they weren't necessary in the long run), but in the end, Alien 3 is a gutsy and very non-Hollywood horror movie, one that will stand the test of time.
B000NA2776|5.0|i love this. it is such a feel good album. he is remarkably talented.    the woman in the background talking about her blindness due to a bomb is depressing, but it also makes you feel like you understand where he is coming from. the pain he has seen, and the joy he still finds in life and music.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I am quite a fan of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\".  This movie does a good job of telling the story and the music is excellent.  The only disappointing thing was you could easily tell that the singing voices were dubbed over the actors.  Otherwise it was a great show.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|The idea, conceived by producer J.J. Abrams, is brilliant, and the story told here is exciting, riveting stuff. It's tense and, at times, genuinely scary. If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br /><br />The problem is in the presentation. And it's a biggie.<br /><br />Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, \\"Queasy-Cam\\"). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit.<br /><br />No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very, very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater.<br /><br />by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor
B000OT6V00|2.0|I really like this movie.  I enjoy every Del Toro film there is, he can do no wrong by me.  This blu-ray is o.k.  The picture quality is not the best, there was some color banding.  Features weren't impressive at all, especially if you've already owned the special special edition of the DVD.  Considering the capacity of these discs, I would of really liked to have seen the original cut of the film on there as well as the Gerald Mc Boing Boing shorts from the first DVD release.  At the end of the day, if you don't mind the premium cost of owning a Blu-Ray, it is worth owning to watch any Del Toro film in HD.  However, that's no excuse for a lazy, substandard, and costly product.
B0002I831S|4.0|The first season of this much-loved, ground-breaking series is superbly presented in this eight disk box set. The transfers onto DVD are excellent and one could hardly imagine how this could be better presented.<br /><br />The 29 episodes range from average (\\"Shore Leave\\", \\"Miri\\") to great (\\"The Devil in the Dark\\", \\"Balance of Terror\\", \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\"). Many of the episodes are commentary on the concerns of our own times and on the human condition generally, which is one of the reasons why they still resonate with us today while just about all other TV series are mere time capsules.<br /><br />Much of the appeal of Star Trek lies in the well defined lead characters of Captain Kirk and Spock. Their interplay is a highlight of the series and so, to a lesser degree, is the playful sniping between Spock and Dr McCoy - and one can only admire the absolute commitment that all the actors bring to their roles.<br /><br />There are so many nice touches such as the use of sound, music, and costumes, and often imaginative direction, which overcome the primitive visual effects and low-budget sets. This series is still well-worth watching - especially for fans - over forty years since it first aired.

B0013FXWVU|4.0|Horton (Carrey) is an elephant who one day discovers a talking speck of dust.  Of course, it is not really the speck that is talking, but the people living on it.  He catches the speck on a clover and manages to talk to the Mayor of Whoville (Carell).  The mayor begs Horton to find a safe place for the speck so his world isn't destroyed.  Horton agrees, but must deal with the Kangaroo (Burnett) who does not believe in anything she cannot see.<br /><br />\\"Horton\\" is the best motion picture adaptation of Dr. Seuss' work.  Better than \\"Granch\\" and far better than \\"Cat in the Hat\\".  The computer animation better suits the characters created in childrens' books many years ago.  Carrey and Carell do solid jobs as the two leads, and the rest of the voice talents are good as well.  This is a movie geared more towards kids, but adults will find enjoyment in it as well.  Son't be surprised if we see Horton again in a few years, trying to hatch an egg.  I recommend this film.
0452289963|4.0|This is an excellent book, very deep and what Oprah and the Author are doing is unprecedented.  Very good at holding a mirror up to your life and if you are present and open, you can take a very good look at yourself, and if necessary...change who you are...for the better of course.
6305907145|5.0|This is by far the best film version of Mansfield Park, and is a million times better than the saccharine version starring Billie Piper that has recently been shown on PBS.  This is a far more skillfully executed, with the civilized zingers that are so prevalent in Jane Austen novels delivered with panache, instead of the clumsy woodiness so often seen in other productions of Austen.  The sensual undertone of sexuality is much more believable than the chaste handling of other directors - I can't believe that the young people of any age tied up their hormones, regardless of the 'rules' of the day.  In short, this is a magnificent version, and one which you will pass on to any friends to introduce them to the joy that is Jane Austen.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|can't wait to see the new INDY movie!  Great to see it back on the big screen.  Of course LeBouf is playing indy's son.  why else would he be called mutt.  remember, as Sean Connery shouted, \\"we named the dog indiana\\".  great to see karen allen back as ravenwood.  would love to see a flashback to see some of abner ravenwood's past.  who would you cast as abner ravenwood?
B000XCZGVI|5.0|The feature on the disc is the most compelling story yet told of the Zodiac case.  I love the point of view that the story is told from, that of the detectives that were unlucky enough to have worked the case and how these murders changed their lives and the lives of that part of the country.<br /><br />Even more compelling are the supplemental features which include interviews with not only some of the real life law enforcement and ancillary personnel involved with the case, but two of the surviving victims.  Watching these videos and hearing the often contradictory statements leaves no wonder why the case remains unsolved.<br /><br />If you have any interest in this genre of film, you owe it to yourself to pick this up pronto.  I'd highly recommend the HD-DVD version which I own and consider to be the superior version, but we all know why I can't do that :)
B00132D808|5.0|The only people who are saying that this  is a bad album are the ones who are comparing it to their first album.  I must say that I apsolutaly hated the singles of the first album, they were very terrible.  I think this is one of my favorite albums I have, I watched the video for Nine In the Afternoon once and wanted this album, compared to hearing the Fever songs many times and hating them.  THis is a melow album compared to the stuff on the first.  If you never liked the first Panic at the Disco album, get this one, it is completly different sound that I really like and doesn't sound as horrible as their first sound.  Now im curious to get their first album considering that people think its better than Pretty Odd, i really doubt it.  Check it out
1400049628|5.0|This book is very entertaining in a dark and messed up way.  I like off color humor and there is plenty of it to be had in this book.  Mr. Brooks spells out survival of Armageddon and the walking dead in a really nice, twisted, and direct way.  He brings up many things the everyday person doesn't think about, like for instance, should I use a machete or handgun to clear a path to safety?  This book is a nice departure from some of the other zombie fiction I've read.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|Say Never Again Sean Connery on making a Bond movie without the right directors. It was most crappy Bond movie I ever seen. And I love Sean Connery as James Bond . 'Never Say Never Again ', is 2 thumbs down . Sorry Sir James.
6305910189|5.0|Here, we have the cast of the original Star Trek Series on yet another adventure into the universe. This is a very focused and tight story with lots of action and a shrewd approach to expanding the story of an older, original Star Trek episode, \\"Space Seed\\".<br /><br />[[ASIN:0792160959 Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 12, Episodes 23 & 24: A Taste of Armageddon/ Space Seed]]<br /><br />It's all about a clan of genetically superior super-humans, led by a man with a Bonepartist attitude, (Kahn), who were once placed on a planet by Captain Kirk, to resolve the takeover of the Starship Enterprise by that group. There, they were expected to survive and create a new civilization.<br /><br />However, no one checked on their progress and things didn't go precisely as planned!<br /><br />The second plot is that a former lover of Captain Kirk's, (Kirk's illegitimate son is introduced to us!), a brilliant scientist, who has invented a device for \\"creating life\\" on barren planets, \\"The Genesis Project\\". The problem is, this device can also be used for planentary destruction because it obliterates any existing life where it is utilized.<br /><br />Kahn seizes upon a chance to escape the torment of his now barren world and seeks to steal the Genesis device and to get even with Kirk in the process. I'll have to stop there to avoid any major spoilers but, for fans of the original series, there is one heckuva MAJOR INCIDENT near the end.<br /><br />This is a superb family, sci-fi film that will stand the test of time. Don't miss it!
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Yeah, it ends differently than the story.But it sure gives you something to think about. Should we never give up? Suffer a horrifying end? Or do as the movie characters do? Choices have consequences, this shows one. Credit a brave choice by the director.
B00004YC2F|4.0|Volodos clearly is a very talented pianist with superhuman finger agility. This being the sixth recording of Rach 3 I own, I did not find Volodos' rendition exceptionally engaging. Other folks might have a different opinion, but I found that I return to this record for only the amazing technical sections, rather than for a full listen. I prefer Horowitz 1951 and Ashkenazy/Previn for the full experience.    The other works on the CD are good, but are not as emotionally engaging as other recordings for me. For example, compare Grimaud's etude Op. 33/9 to Volodos'. Again, I'm mainly expressing personal preference. The music and sound quality on this CD is still great, hence the four stars.
B00132D808|3.0|What is Panic (bye bye extremely original exclamation point) doing putting out an album where even if told it was Panic i still wouldn't be able to recognize them. Everything that made them unique is gone. If youre looking for an all around average CD by a no-name band, might as well get this one because thats exactly how it sounds. I'm dissapointed.
B000YGIIQI|5.0|. . .but I loved it!  I love to watch all his tv shows, and this book was very interesting.  Not the type of background I would have imagined him to have.  He is very inspiring.  He shows that with hard work and determination, you can do anything.  I always hated people who used their troubled childhoods as an excuse for their own miserable lives.  Gordon is a great example of how you can use your rough childhood as a guide for 'what not to do' when you are an adult.  We either repeat our parents mistakes, or learn from them.
B0013FBS20|5.0|The story and the script were amazing.  But like all movies acting can make it or kill it in the end.  That being said, something happened to Will Smith between I Robot and The Pursuit of Happyness where he went from being a snotty so so actor to becoming a flippin amazing actor.  I have no idea what it was.  Maybe it was having a child.  I have no idea but this is the second film he has been in where he blew me away.  Like I robot he was working within a fictional future world which is why I am comparing the films.  I think the challenge of all actors is to make the unreal, real.  This is really really really hard in a film like this one that is so far from reality yet Will did it and I think it is a crowning achievement for him as an actor.  It was nothing short of brilliance.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This album has really inspired me to successfully recover from my addictions...I am thankful and forever grateful to Nikki Sixx for making such great music about overcoming major obstacles in the life of an addict, and now a recovered addit. This Album will be my favorite forever.

B00005JPTK|2.0|This movie strays way too far from the book.  My son read the book (and told me about it along the way) then bought the movie.  Big disappointment.  If I had not known what the story was actually about, I would have been completely lost watching the movie (as it is, I was lost even knowing what the story was about).  When the movie was finished, I told my son I wanted to read the book.  EXCELLENT!  You won't want to put it down.  This book has such potential to make a really great movie; unfortunately, this movie does not fit the bill.  I have no idea what they were thinking about when they made this movie, but it definitely was not the book.  Characters are nothing as portrayed in the book, which makes for a very disappointing movie.  READ THE BOOK, you won't be disappointed.

1591391105|3.0|This book is in a long tradition of 'expanded' magazine articles.  There's more than enough content for an outstanding journal article, but when the concept is turned into a book, it's a bit thin.  A least this example of the genre hasn't been hopelessly padded, so it gets one star for having some good ideas, a star for not wasting its readers' time (presumably more valuable in this context than the few dollars they spend on the book), a half star for not pretending to be more than it is (i.e., no claim to being the 30 second solution to all the problems any executive has ever had or will have) and a half star for being a fair value proposition.  Incidentally, I gave a copy of this book to my son (he's a couple of years out of college and had just received his first promotion at a General Electric subsidiary) and his reaction was that its really intended for managers a few years further into their careers. I think he's right.

B0015KO52S|3.0|I'll start off by saying I'm a huge White Stripes fan and an even bigger Greenhornes fan.  I think the Greenhornes trump all of the garage rock bands from the recent years.  Not a huge Benson fan but he's okay.  Anyway, the new Raconteurs album is decent but it's not great.  It's far more ambitious and layered than Broken Boy Soldiers.  They definitely sound like a more polished band and the weight of the sound seems to be more reliant on Jack White than Benson this time around, which is good or bad depending on your views.  The only problem is the songs just aren't that good.  I've listened to this all the way through probably around 15 times now and it just isn't growing on me.  The only tracks that really strike me as outstanding are Consoler of the Lonely, Salute Your Solution and Carolina Drama.  There are several okay songs: The Switch and the Spur, Five on the Five and Attention.  But the rest just don't do it for me.  Overall Broken Boy Soldiers is more pop and easier to listen to but Consolers is more ambitious and creative - it just isn't that good.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|An excellent motion picture that shows not only that it's possible to love more than one person at a time, but also how people grow and change their values and perspectives over time.  Buy it.  You'll like it.
0030565812|5.0|Full of humanity, integrity, sacrifice, humility, and character. This is an uplifting book about the power of the human spirit to overcome great adversity. I loved it and I do agree that this book should be required reading for everyone. Parts of this book brought tears to my eyes. It illuminates a great man and the struggle people had to endure to overcome a great blight. To think that the U.S. did not place sanctions on South Africa until the mid 1980's, when men like Mandela were fighting and dying for the right to be considered human. I read recently that Pat Roberston, the great American evangelical, was a supporter of apartheid. How incredibly inhuman. If you know anything about South Africa, you will know that by the end of his long incarceration, even Mandela's captors had acquired great respect for this man. A must read...in many ways, this is a life changing, life affirming book. Powerful.

B00008PX8P|4.0|Since their Dec '07 concert I've been on a Led Zeppelin renaissance.  That concert planted a craving for classic footage and this DVD certainly does that.    The first DVD, with their concert at the Royal Albert Hall is fantastic.  It's easily one of the best of their \\"early\\" concerts.  John Bonham's Moby Dick is incredible!  Versions of 'Dazed and Confused' and 'White Summer/Black Mountain Side' particularly stand out.  The concert itself is very raw, young Zeppelin.  Jimmy Page in his humble vest sweater, white sneakers and blue jeans contrasted the sheer muscle of his performance.  The first DVD is worth the price of the package alone.    The second DVD is also excellent, but I do have some reservations about it.  Full marks for superimposing an L.A '72 version of 'Immigrant Sont' over the Sydney Australia '72 footage.  It's very creative.  The four selections from the band's NYC concert in 1973 are taken from footage compiled for 'The Song Remains The Same'.  Sadly, I remember going to the theatre to see this movie with versions of 'Black Dog' and 'Since I've Been Loving You' - so there's nothing new there.  The version of 'The Ocean' is a treat.    Before the internet and file sharing, Zep fans used to swap LP or cassette bootlegs of their concerts, and I was one of them.  I had a portion of the Earls Court 1975 concert and was dying to see what the DVD had to offer.  The footage is spectacular considering the original condition of the film.  Mind you, I have to admit, I've heard better sound quality on some bootlegs when it comes to Page's guitar in the mix.  Is it me, or do you really have to strain to hear his accoustic guitar during the intimate accoustic set?  'In My Time of Dying' is nothing short of stellar as is the version of 'Trampled Underfoot'; but the sad reality is Jimmy's guitar is lost in the mix of heavy drums and Jones' keyboards.  Page does one heck of a solo (one of the best I've heard) but you can barely hear him, and that's disappointing for an \\"official\\" release.  Don't get me wrong though, the Earls Court Concert (one of 4) is easily one of Zeppelin's best concerts period.  'Stairway To Heaven' is also great.    Also on the second DVD is the 1979 Knebworth concert - another Zep bootleg I had!  This time, the sound quality equals the footage.  Knebworth is simply another phenominal Zeppelin concert.      Though my review focuses on the major attractions of this DVD, the other clips and side treats this package offers is very cool, especially a couple of very young versions of 'Dazed'.    Alas, I'd give this DVD a five star rating if it had at least SOME footage from their '77 tour - which was a collosal tour.  There must have been footage out there somewhere which director's Page and Carruthers could have spinned their digital enhancement magic.  Apparently this collection is hailed as the best of the best and ultimately who am I to question Jimmy Page?!
B00110K62U|5.0|I'm so glad that it's the 10th Anniversary of the Dream Cast in Concert because I have not been able to find this DVD before this. This concert is so amazing and moving, it's a joy to watch everytime. Especially poignant is the finale when the Valjeans from around the world sing and come up on stage. It's simply fantastic.

B00005JPCF|5.0|\\"Happy Feet\\" is a children's movie centering around cute animals who can walk, talk, sing and dance. If one is upset by the notion of anthropomorphism, then one should avoid this movie at all costs, as well as all children's programming in general. (Bugs Bunny? A rabbit that poisons itself by eating carrots, walks upright and talks?! Big Bird?? A giant bird that sings and recites the alphabet?!! ARRRGGGHHH!!! Beatrix Potter, A. A. Milne, PBS, Warner Brothers, all must be destroyed!!!!)<br /><br />Another point I've seen repeatedly brought up in reviews is that of source-less music and alien lyrics/tempo/rhythm/beat. Again, I beg you to stop and think. We take for granted that music will reach a crescendo at climactic moments in all movies, as well as the fact of music setting the mood for television and movies. Did Celine Dion's voice really stretch completely across the ocean when Titanic voyagers were dying? Of course not, but the moment was made more poignant by the addition of haunting music. Analyzing where such music comes from when no instruments are visible, or why Walt Disney introduced singing animals (who taught them how to talk, let alone how to sing?? and how do they know what they're saying??!!) is akin to driving one's head into a wall.<br /><br />Most children's movies begin with a few basic assumptions, among which are: 1) suspension of disbelief is easy as long as characters are understandable, 2) music makes it fun. Given these premises, the music, singing, dancing and talking found in \\"Happy Feet\\" are perfect for the movie's intended audience: the young, and the young-at-heart.<br /><br />As for the plot, a dropped egg survives to become an adorable emperor penguin chick named Mumble. Mumble enters the world with happy tap-dancing feet, is chided by his father and shunned by other chicks emulating the attitudes of adults around them. Growing tougher in the face of adversity, Mumble is ultimately banished from his home by the ignorance of the elders--rather than learning about differences, they fear them. Nothing new here except the updated way in which the story is told. Every generation must learn the same truths; this movie teaches its generation as \\"Dumbo\\" spoke to children in 1941 when first released.<br /><br />Trying to prove that dancing doesn't causing the colony's drought, Mumble embarks on a quest, accompanied by his amiable, witty little friends, the amigos--a group of adelie penguins. Along the way, he picks up Lovelace, a rockhopper penguin who also narrates the tale. Mumble does eventually find the cause of the food shortage: overfishing. How to let the humans know what the cost of indifference is? And will Mumble ever see his family again?<br /><br />Yes, there is an environmental message in this movie; it was made in Australia, what did you expect? However, this isn't some doomsday do-you-know-where-that-meat-came-from message, nor is it traumatizing like \\"Watership Down.\\" Rather, it's told in the same tone that \\"Free Willy\\" or \\"Finding Nemo\\" was--matter of factly.<br /><br />Coming from Chicago and San Francisco, I found the adelie penguins, with their enormous capacity for joy, latino cadences, and taste for dancing and togetherness spot on, and hilarious--like being in high school all over again. I also found the little touches, like mama penguins feeding their babies by regurgitating food into their throats, excellent as the characters are made more real. (Tweens especially love that part.) This is no different than a talking fish scrubbing himself in an anemone prior to swimming off to school.<br /><br />As far as how to differentiate characters in a movie full of identical-looking penguins, the creators did a decent job. Mumble was dropped as an egg; that doesn't affect his beautiful blue eyes, but does account for the fact that as an adolescent-to-young-adult penguin, his baby fluff still hasn't been fully shed. The females have larger busts and something resembling hips as a way to differentiate them from the flock, just as the frightened, sanctimonious old fart who leads the colony is crooked with uneven feathers, looking as an aged penguin should look. Norma Jean, Mumble's mother, has a beauty mark on her breast to distinguish her. Memphis, Mumble's father, is larger than most of the penguins, and is purposely modeled on Elvis, (or rather, on Johnny Cash modeling himself after Elvis.) To be honest, I had a harder time keeping the puppies in 101 Dalmatians straight.<br /><br />Taken overall, this movie is an enjoyable ride. My toddler and her older cousins could happily watch it daily if they were allowed, (all that dancing is *so much fun!*)htened, sanctimonious old fart who leads the colony is crooked with uneven feathers, looking as an aged penguin should look.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|We've always been brainwashed into believing that \\"socialized medicine\\" are dirty words and that if we had it here in the U.S., the quality of medical care would be far worse than it is now.  (I don't know how much worse it could be than almost killing Dennis Quaid's twin babies.)  Not so.  Wait till you see this film!  It'll make you want to move to France or Canada or England, or even Cuba, on the first plane out.  The medical care that is offered in these countries is not only FREE, but also excellent, and apparently the doctors are not living on meager salaries like we've been told.  One English doctor's salary has afforded him a comfortable lifestyle, with a million dollar home and a luxury automobile.  And the cost of medication in Cuba will raise the hairs on the back of your neck.  5 pesos for the same medication that costs $150 in this country!  If you haven't seen this film, do so quickly.  It's excellent and a real eye-opener.

Whereas if he thinks negatively he will attract negative objects and reations. This book he me significantly.    A MUST BUY FOR ALL OPTIMISTS!!!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is nowhere near being a bad director. He is a brilliant man with a great passion for the type of movies that he wants to create, and he does it with great skill. This shows through even with his clear film cutting \\"mistakes\\" and purposefully prolonged filming of uninteresting objects, or of characters who may talk for extended periods of time without feeling the need to cut the majority of these parts into the \\"deleted scenes\\" on DVD.   Not just any filmmaker can make a movie with the intention of it being poorly crafted without succeeding on levels where they weren't trying.   That concept makes a perfect analogy with Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Martyr Patricio Clito Ruiz y Picasso - commonly referred to as Pablo Picasso; that an artist should actually know how to paint and draw human forms and anatomy correctly before intentionally doing it wrong. Quentin knows all of the anatomy.     I absolutely loved Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms in this movie. Their acting was somewhat a contrast from the other; where Tracie seemed often forceful and aggressive (hence her being the driver), Zoe was extremely lighthearted in her personality and was going along for the ride while still being on the edge.     I honestly never thought of Mr. Tarantino pulling off a movie with such a large vehicle chase sequence. He finished the film by executing it with top notch speed and precision, and the result had me cheering in excitement for all of the girls in the film. It was pure satisfaction.

B000FVBLEI|2.0|What a great band but the singing hooks are so boring.  Don't get me wrong I love singing and screaming together but why be so predicable.  This is another attempt to be Killswitch.  Let KSG be KSG!!!!!!!!!!  The Weak Willed is the best song for me because the clean singing came out of nowhere.  That's what's up.  Rest of the album is just KSG with a different singer.  Great musicians but (follow the leader/cliche) driven.

Zoey Redbird has just become a vampire in this first book and it shows the struggles that she has to go through in order to get use to everything and the way that they live at the new school. Her family does not support her at all and practically disownes her. Her grandmother is the only one of her family who is proud and supports her. I really gre to love the grandma and wished that she was mine. She meets some great friends.     This is a great read for all ages.

B000GY729M|5.0|I bought this album 2 weeks ago and have probably listend to it 6 or 8 times and I like it more each time. The album just makes you feel good when you listen to it, and there are a couple of songs that are really great. I typically fast forward in most albums to get to the tracks I like, but I find I do not do that in this album because even the lesser songs are enjoyable.     I had not heard The Killers before this album so I did not come in with expectations of what they should sound like, so I can not compare how this album is compared to their prior work, but I do think that all bands evolve and it would be a shame if they always kept giving us the same material.    Overall, a great album that I think I will be coming back to again and again.
1416550518|4.0|I wouldn't call The House at Riverton page-turning--but it is a novel that creates believable, human, authentic characters whose follies form the backstory of a life set in the Victorian era of England.     I enjoyed the story. Its a wonderful, if not a tad plodding read. The story takes a while to develop, but the themes are very rich. The contrast betwee the two different lives--that of the paid staff and that of the royal class--are very well-developed. Its almost as if the servant class was considered sub-human. And yet, as often happens in these stories, the two worlds collide. Royals forget their protocol and engage with the servant class.     When you've finished a literary novel, you feel you've accomplished something beyond a cheap thrill. This is a fun read and a well-written book that not only entertains, but also educates about much of the history of the period.
0553582038|3.0|George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series is one of the more popular contemporary works of fantasy out there.  And definitely one of the better ones, thanks to the earlier tomes in the series.  Books 2 and 3 were downright entertaining.  However, this last book, A Feast for Crows, is a definite disappointment.<br /><br />The land of Westeros is recovering from the War of the Five Kings.  The list of pretenders and contenders have narrowed down.  The young King Tommen now sits the Iron Throne, supported by the powerful houses of the Lannisters and the Tyrells.  The self-styled king of the north, Balon Greyjoy is dead and replaced by the pirate Euron Crow's Eye.  Meanwhile, Brienne has left King's Landing in search of Sansa Stark.  Unbeknownst to her, Sansa has now become a part of Littlefinger's plot in the Eyrie.  The Kingslayer, having found some measure of honor, is travelling west, to take Riverrun from the Blackfish.  Samwell Tarly and his wildling woman, Gilly, have finally made it to Oldtown.  Unfortunately, the elderly Maester, Aemon Targaryen, perished during the long voyage.<br /><br />You will not find POVs from Daenerys, Jon Snow, or Tyrion in this latest installment.  A pity, since they tend to have the more entertaining POVs.<br /><br />Yes, detail and minutae can make a novel more realistic and compelling.  However, such overly-elaborate descriptives should be leading somewhere.  Details and minutae, for their own sake, only serve as fillers.  Everything in a novel has to move the story and plot forward.  George Martin, I believe, spun his wheels on this one.  That's one of the problems in a long series.  The late Robert Jordan has been guilty of the same thing with his epic Wheel of Time.<br /><br />I agree with my fellow reviewers.  This is a novel in search of a story, and an editor. George Martin dropped the ball on this one.
B0010X745K|2.0|Tried to like it, but this movie lost me pretty early on with a totally unrealistic scenario. The townsfolk are trapped in a supermarket, with some unknown killer mist outside. One woman wants to go out to find her kids who she left at home. Others respond that the mist might be poison gas. She self-righteously asks if anyone will escort her. The men silently refuse - and the film makes it clear that they're to be ashamed of themselves!<br /><br />Not only that, THEY LET HER OPEN THE DOOR AND LEAVE! That's right, she might be dooming them all to poison gas, but not only is she \\"the good mother\\" in this movie, they don't even try to stop her from possibly killing them all! Now that's not normal human behavior.<br /><br />There are many other scenes that just don't make sense at all. Some men cut off a tentacle and later try to convince the others that there's a horrible monster outside ... without showing them the tentacle. Why not just BRING IT AND SHOW THEM? I was getting really annoyed by this time. And there are many other scenes where people just STAND STILL to be killed, rather than running away.<br /><br />There is the stereotypical religious (Christian, what else?) nut calling for human sacrifice and spewing vulgarities and hatred, but that's OK, because, you know, Christian viewers are not going to bomb your building or anything, so it's totally OK to offend them. And it's \\"brave\\" and \\"edgy\\", too. And everyone knows that's what they're really like, right? But Christophobes will be totally satisfied, if you know what I mean, wink wink. (There is a mention that she is \\"unstable\\", but the whole religious-people-are-scum aspect will make a big impression upon ignorant viewers.)<br /><br />The ending was somewhat disgusting (not visually, but logically). You could see it coming a mile off. Again, a scenario where people are not behaving like real people at all, just to score a cheap ... something.<br /><br />Most of the monster effects are neat, especially a behemoth near the end - a real H.P. Lovecraft vibe.t vibe.
0143034901|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I almost couldn't put it down (much like the character in the book with his find).  Filled with a little mystery, a bit period piece and a bit romantic all rolled into a book that engrossed me to the very end.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Soundtracks are the next natural step for a fan of a movie, especially a musical.  This particular recording is evocative and entertaining. I've been a fan of Baz Luhrmann for ages.  He has a big quirky sense of humor but still packs emotion into his work.  The movie itself is a fast paced fun romp and the music completely inspired.  Some may be thrown by the use of familiar songs in the movie but they all fit beautifully.  The soundtrack uses the familiar to set the mood well.  Songs are used in quick succession, in tandem and often paired in medleys with new compositions.  Enjoyable, mood provoking and nostalgic all at once.  All the musical numbers are fun but some took me by surprise.  I especially was taken by the tango number using The Police's \\"Roxanne.\\"  The performances are wonderful.  I really enjoyed Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman and the rest of the cast. Well done!  Heck, it's a great CD to get you moving while doing housework.  How many soundtracks can you say this about?
0374105235|5.0|Regardless of what people say is true and false, no doubt this story could be true for hundreds of thousands of young children fighting in war. This wasnt written to give you half the story or 3 quarters. Ishmael Beah explains everything in this disturbing but inspiring story of a childs view of war while taking part in it. Whats so inspiring is how a great person can enter war, kill, come out so messed up, yet still find hope for his past feeling of happiness afterwards. A great read, a great person, and a great story.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I truely enjoyed this version, and think it is a very plesant way to spend some time.  Very well done by all involved.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I had no idea that I liked punk!<br /><br />Now that I know this, I'm quite pleased, and I've got Rise Against to thank for that. So thanks, Rise Against, finding you guys is almost as good as when I found Stage a year ago; or learning to make French Toast; or hiring a maid service to clean my apartment (they're much cheaper than you think, and they clean WAY better than I could ever hope to).<br /><br />Like most people, I found them through the radio. Since it's a rare thing for me to actually listen to the radio, it was shear luck that I caught \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" when I did, and all I could remember from the song were the lyrics \\"We are the angry and desperate...\\". Thankfully, Texas invented the internet a few years back, so all I had to do was Google it, up came \\"The Sufferer and the Witness\\", and I haven't looked back since.<br /><br />Prior to this, the only punk I've really listened to were the Ramones, so I made the faulty assumption that all punk was disjointed and over simplified. Not so with Rise Against, folks. They're loud, rhythmic, and damn awesome!<br /><br />The album is best listened to as a whole. Instead of being a collection of songs, it's more like an extended story with varying measures of timbre. It flows similar to how '90s indie hip-hop albums did; every proceeding track complements the preceding track, and one song will occasionally flow right into the next one with out skipping a beat.<br /><br />There isn't a single miss on here, and the album's organization is top notch. My favorite track is still probably \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\", but I'm starting to lean more toward \\"Survive\\". I love the way it slowly builds, and then just explodes all over the place!<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy any of the singles, I guarantee you'll love the album!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I love this product!     The swivel sweeper is basically a broom and dustpan put together in one nice package. It works wonderfully on my laminate floors and it also works on the area rugs that we have. I would not recommend that it replace your vacuum, as it does not have any actual suction power. But it is a great product, much better than the Swiffer models, this one does not need to be plugged in to charge and it holds a charge for a much longer time, I can clean the entire house (all laminate flooring throughout) with one charge (plus, it will pick up some things on your area rugs whereas the Swiffer model does not).    As a mother of 3 boys I can attest that it is super easy to use and durable.  My 6 year old loves helping me with the chores and it lasted for a year before my 2 year old ripped the wire out of the battery pack (something that only my child would be able to do).     I have other neighbors and friends that have had their swivel sweeper for 2-3 years with the only problem of needing to replace the battery as they left it charging for more than the manufacture recommended 24 hours.    I am going to buy another one as I can sweep the floor and hold my 4 month old baby at the same time.     A great little gadget, I highly recommend it!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The movie is so deceptively simple, but the music and the emotional resonance really stay with you. The soundtrack here really gives you a chance to hear the music all the way through, and to appreciate the songwriting power of the two main characters/real-life musicians.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I am going to start with a disclaimer, aimed towards fans of Matheson's book: This is not what you would call a \\"faithful\\" adaptation.  Matheson's novel was more of a social commentary (as was most of his work, including his several \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes and movie screenplays), with an ending that left readers no doubt that he was reaching beyond the realm of science fiction and horror.  This movie...not so much.<br /><br />The film must be judged on its own merits.  Fortunately, it holds up.  I was skeptical--as soon as I heard they were putting Will Smith in a production of \\"I Am Legend,\\" I balked.  Vincent Price pulled it off in \\"The Last Man on Earth;\\" I've never seen the Charlton Heston version (\\"The Omega Man\\"), so I can't judge it.  But Will Smith?  Don't get me wrong, he's a great action hero.  But this isn't--or, rather, wasn't--an action story.  So...again...Will Smith?<br /><br />Well, he pulls it off.  He probably could even have pulled off a faithful adaptation; the first half shows so much potential, I think he could've gone all the way.  As is, as soon as the cheesy computer-animated monsters come in, it becomes something more of a shoot-em-up.  In fact, I'm willing to bet you that there are two good reasons for watching this movie: the scenery (my God, it'll take your breath away), and Will Smith.  Well, also the dog.  And, if you've heard about the scene that's not good for dog lovers...well, you're right.  I didn't think it would shake me much, but it did.  Kudos to the film-makers; that's probably the one scene in here that SHOULD'VE been in the Matheson novel.<br /><br />So, for those doubters out there, I suggest watching the film.  If you're a Richard Matheson fan, go into it with a grain or two of salt, please, and judge the film on its own merits.  It still isn't a GREAT movie, no; it could've been, I think, had they stuck to the novel.  They digressed, however, and what we have here is a slightly-better-than-average popcorn flick, with vampire/zombie hybrid things.  And Bob Marley.ings.  And Bob Marley.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This is one of Dream Theater's greatest.  Disc one is more of a Train of Thought type metal sound. (I know, Train of Thought came after) Disc two is my favorite.  The songs blend seamlessly together and it listening to one track is impossible. You will want to hear them all in a row after hearing one. Just a great album all around!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This album was a pleasure to listen to and it was even better to watch live. It is full of energy, which comes across stronger in some songs like \\"Mama\\" and \\"The Sharpest Lives.\\" When these songs come on, they just make you want to go to a concert and mosh or jump around your room. Plus, it shows that they didn't lose their ability to make the album fun, which is a great balance for the tone of the album.    Furthermore, the lyrics to this album are a lot darker and a lot more intense than the previous two albums. A touching and heart-wrenching song is \\"Cancer\\" because even though it was one of the shortest songs, it packed an incredible punch that affects anyone whether they are personally affected by cancer or not. The singles from the album showed a pretty good representation of the lyrics within the album. \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" showed the dark yet hopeful lyrics that a listener can find took on a different sound in \\"Famous Last Words.\\" Then \\"Teenagers\\" is their fun and full of energy song, that reminds me a lot of \\"I'm Not Okay.\\"     All in all, I think this album has a lot to offer to a new MCR listener and to someone who has been a fan since the first album. Also, I know that this spring is the last leg of the tour, but if you get a chance, definitely check them out live, because it is the best way to hear the album. Enjoy!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I watched the first season of Tudors but knew that I would want to watch it over and over again. The actors, costumes, everything was just the best. I am patiently waiting for the second season to start. It may not be historicaly factual but then again, who knows?
B000F8DB4O|5.0|I have owned this record for about 10 years now and it is STILL getting better and better.    I am a 31 year old Jazz guitarist. I enjoy it all, from contemporary smooth jazz to vintage chord melody to gypsy to bebop, I love it all.    My favorite artists include GEORGE BENSON, JOHNNY SMITH, NORMAN BROWN, PAT METHENY, WES MONTGOMERY, CHARLIE CHRISTIAN, BARNEY KESSEL, JOE PASS, TAL FARLOW, etc. - The list goes on and on.    If I had to choose four, Benson and Metheny would be in there, as well as Norman Brown and Johnny Smith.  As for George Benson, Breezin' is my favorite record - NOT because of the reason that most people love it (masquerade, breezin', etc), but because of the other wonderful songs that don't get the same attention.    My whole point of what you just read is to give some background on what I like, for you to see if this review holds any water with you, or contains ANY kind of merit.  I tend to like the songs and records that the masses don't like. NO, I don't do this out of practice and I am not trying to be different, but I have always found that the material I naturally gravitate to winds up being underrated tossed aside by majority.     WE LIVE HERE is a record with material that is VERY accessible, yet there is still a technical element.    When it comes to Pat Metheny, I LOVE his guitar tone. I am referring to his 'electric' guitar tone.   I once read a quote about an all acoustic Metheny album where the reviewer stated that it would be the perfect marriage for Metheny fans.  I DISAGREE.  I have no interest in hearing Pat Metheny (or any other players for that matter) play an 'acoustic' record.   Of course I am referring to my dislike for actual ACOUSTIC guitar with BRONZE strings - Yuck. When I think of Jazz guitar, I think of the city, not some stinky country, rolling meadows and hayseeds.  Nothing wrong with it, but it's not for me...and I don't think it fits well in jazz, sorry, but I think bronze strings and soundholes should stay with folk, rock, pop, and country.    I want to hear these guys play Archtop guitars through amps...period.    Sure, this record has it's share of guitar synth, but that's a big part of Pat's playing. Even more important to me, it features a boat-load of his ibanez clean tone, which is top notch, simple, and extremely satisfying for my ears.  The songwriting is wonderful. The songs are very catchy, but as I said, they retain a technical element which should satisfy the fans who love to see him rip.    If my review resembles your tastes, go for this record and GIVE IT SOME TIME, as it takes a bit to grow on you. That's the best in my book, that way you won't get burned out on it fast.    If my review is the opposite of your tastes, I would STILL check it out.     I can't stress how wonderful WE LIVE HERE is
B0015KO52S|5.0|Without reservation, I think COTL will be among the best reviewed albums of the year, and appear on many top ten lists....    JWIII, BB, LJ, and PK are back with a vengeance performing their sophomore effort.For all those 'agent provocateurs' who thought the band's strategy of a quick release without preview, hype, fanfare to the media et al was an attempt to circumvent the sophomore jinx, y'all are so wrong.Every review I've read since release date puts this album among the best of the year - and it's only March!!!     Consolers of the Lonely is everything that Broken Boy Soldiers wasn't:A ballsy, brash, in your face collection of tunes encompassing different genres and tempos,while taking chances that pay off handsomely. The Teurs have really amped up the energy level as well.While BBS was often criticized for being slightly anemic and tentative, which was only reinforced by how the songs, when performed live sounded far superior (check out the video shoot for 'Level' in that NY warehouse session and I'm sure you'll agree), COTL just kills and thrills, start to finish...    This album is, however, challenging to the listener. A good 4-5 listens beginning to end with quality headphones are needed to even form a cursory opinion about this album.Vocals, piano, screaming guitar riffs, bass, drums fly at you in all directions. It takes those few listens to start to really figure everything out....    Early favorites include:    Title Track - Infectious and a straight forward rocker    Old Enough - BB, if you weren't a 'Teur, you'd be a hell of a jingle                 writer    The Switch and the Spur - This tune, with it's well placed, yet devastating horns, would be right at home during the opening credits of a Sergio Leone western, or perhaps a Tarantino 'Someone done me wrong and I aims to fix it' flick    These Stones Will Shout - JWIII perfection....    Buy this album, as it will provide endless hours of listening enjoyment.Albeit challenging ones.....
B000WMFZNS|5.0|This was well worth waiting for.  The color and audio track are superb.  I only regard that is not in blu-ray high def.
B00005Y1UX|5.0|amazingly objective... love is the greatest wealth on earth and poor is the man who is in lack of it... this experience had to be eternized...
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I must admit, I was apprehensive about this movie.  I absolutely ADORE Neil Gaiman's books, from 'Neverwhere' to his 'Sandman' series and including the hilarious 'Good Omens'.  I could go on and on!  But cast and crew came thru on this one, capturing the sweetness and fantasy of Gaiman's fairy tale.  Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer in particular seemed to have a terrific time with their characters.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is a sick cd that is just as great as the bends and ok computer.  And I received it immediately.
B0012Q94QW|1.0|What can I say about this movie. It is just bad on every level. Sabre-tooth tigers in Africa??? Wooly mammoths in Egypt, impossible!!! They would have died from the heat. No remains of a wooly mammoth have been found anywhere other than North America, north Russia and Siberia. Modern day African elephants have never been domesticated as beasts of burden, only Asian elephants and even they can be somewhat troublesome from time to time. And iron weapons, oh please. No indication of any iron metal-working has been found from that time period. If this movie was supposed to be fantasy, o.k., but it didn't work on that level either, as the storyline and action scenes have all been done and seen before. Nothing new for us. Roland Emmerich should be ashamed of himself. I wish there were a way he could be banned from film-making after this giant turkey. that's what those things were in the jungle scene, weren't they?
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have been struggling to find words to describe my reaction to this DVD.  Everything I've come up with so far has sounded trite and cliche.  So, instead of gushing about it - as I could easily do, I'll keep it simple.  I found the story powerful and, at times, haunting.  The acting was superb.  The overall cinematography was stunning.  And Richard Armitage was perfection.
1416523359|2.0|Rarely if ever does King disappoint his readers. I read 200 pages of this novel until I finally couldn't take anymore of the eternally repetitous cutesy baby talk of Lisey's dead husband. It's just too drawn out and there is very little to grab this reader 200 pages into the book.  I think this is only Stephen King book I did not want to finish. He still remains my favorite writer however. It is also too much of a Romance novel for me. Give me chills and blood, not sappy sentimentalism. Your time will be better spent reading instead his (Richard Bachman)book \\"Blaze\\", which is as good as King gets(and that's pretty damn good). Blaze is a page-turner that will keep you up at night, in the grand King tradition.
B0000009SY|2.0|Look, Im a Zappa fan who has listened to most of the man's entire output. I'm in agreement, that Zappa was a unique figure in American music.    BUT  This is his weakest effort, shamelessly pandering to the same people he seems to parody.  It's truly air-head rock, not much different than AOL rock, with little Zappa humor and flourishes. The humor is either dated, or aimed at pre-teens.  This period of Zappa (early 80's)I enjoy the least.    Zappa was brave.  Zappa was brilliant.  But Zappa was not occasionaly without fault.  Im sure there are more meaningful performances in the Vault, than this mash-up of psuedo-reggae, glam-rock and purile humor.
0525948023|5.0|First of all, I loved this book. And yes, as many other reviewers have pointed out; there are numerous books that deal with similar subject matter: often in different ways or with different terminology.   I enjoyed Tolle's book and have enjoyed many other books on similar subject matters because the more I read different perspectives and viewpoints (often from different spiritual or philisophical standpoints) it helps me to really understand how to improve my quality of life on the earth. So, I would absolutely recommend this book to someone interested in enriching their life by raising their level of consciousness, but there are numerous other books that are also fantastic too. I don't think any one book is a 'cure all', but I believe that this book does have the power to help and touch people and bring them closer to living a life of peace and happiness and personal power.    The only thing I think is important to mention about this book that seems a little confusing or contradictory is this: Tolle doesn't ever really 'lay out' in a succint and straightforward way really how to bring this work into a day to day context. He does say that it is important to 'be in the moment', but of course many reviewers (and others I know) have asked the question: but what about planning? How do you plan effectively for the future?  From his book, and others I have read on the subject; they seem to be saying that it is simply important that you embrace stillness and 'being in the moment' as much as possible in your life so that you are as connected to your 'inner self' or 'soul' as much as you choose to be.   For example: if you are working in a high stress environment and despite reading this book and other spritual books, you decide you love your job and want to stay in it, I think thats fine: there is no doubt that you could use this thinking and many of these techniques not only to be healthier and happier in your overall life, but also be more succesful in your job by truly 'being' in the moment in whatever position you have.  I don't think Tolle ever advocates not planning ahead or not reflecting back on the past; he just suggests that we make a shift from living our life totally in the past/future to much more in the present. And advocates having a level of consciousness and I would argue, with a level of non-attachment that prevents you from being anchored to past/future and 'forms' with which you have attached yourself.    A number of reviwers I noticed, critised the book for making it too sound too simple; and I do understand that criticism fully. I personally really loved the way he kept it really simple. For me (and I believe that we are all different and tools that we can use to make us happier/more peaceful are different), I find that the tools in this book are absolutely making my life better, more alive and more present. And I also find that I am more accepting of life the way it is.  And if thats what Tolle's book could do for me, then I am deeply grateful that it found its way into my life.  I hope others find it helpful too.
0143143492|5.0|This is the best book I have read for total and complete understanding of our purpose on this earth.  Not only does he explain why we do what we do but why  other people act and react the way they do. But the very best thing of all, is being given the skills to pursue our peace of mind and our spiritual being.  Mr Tolle explains in such layman terms that anyone can understand how to achieve this goal and live peacefully and happily the rest  of their lives.    Thank you so much for I have experienced this awakening. It is hard to speak this to friends and family in a way they can understand
1878424505|5.0|I absolutely adored this book!  Don't be decieved by the simplicity of the wisdom presented in this book; when a friend first introuced me to his teachings - the 4 rules seemed too simple...but once I started working with them and trying to apply one a day, or one at work..etc. I really started to realise the power of the four agreements.   This book is a must-read for anyone who has realised that they have certain beliefs or 'agreements', in their head that they feel no longer serve them or limit them in some way.  As an artist, I have long held onto many self limiting ideas about my potential as an artist as a by-product of having a non-artistic and conservative family. I believe that many people, indeed most people, have probably taken on other peoples beliefs that have limited them similarly. I'm not saying that its easy to let go of these beliefs, but I promise that if you try it does get easier. I also realised that choosing your own beliefs and thoughts in life, doesn't mean giving up relationships or hurting people you love.     It hurts to realise that the critical voice in your head that has encouraged you to take things personally and make assumptions your whole life (that you have trusted) has not been a trust worthy voice, but it is worth it, to let go and become free.  I'm not saying that this book is for everyone, but I do believe that it has the power to help many!!
1559408855|1.0|Set aside all that plastic artsy-fartsy intellectually enlightened critical dialog you've been reading, and you end up with a movie illustrating the sick fantasies of de Sade's criminally insane brain cells on celluloid. Blood, feces, and torture - that's it. That's the subject matter. I watched it out of curiosity, and regret it. The imagery of the two men french-kissing with excrement on their mouths has been difficult to erase, not to mention the child rapes, the scenes of mutilation, and total absence of responsibility for the creation of such an otherwise gross and boring film.

B000002H6C|4.0|If memory serves, this was actually the first album I bought on CD. I was saddened by Cliff Burton's passing, but hopeful that Metallica could keep it together and produce yet another great album. And they really did! From the opening bars of \\"Blackened\\", you could tell that this was a new sound, new attitude, and a new level of intensity for their existing lyrical obsessions (war, politics, and social inequality). It was power speed metal that made me want to pick up a lead pipe and go smash an effigy of Lady Justice, douse the pieces in gasoline, torch them, and go read Marx until daybreak.     But then, this album also marked the transition point for Metallica. All of a sudden, they weren't \\"underground\\" any more. The song \\"One\\" was a major hit on MTV and the radio stations...and they were nominated for a Grammy. Jethro Tull ended up winning that year and in the ensuing controversy, it occurred to me that \\"what's this...a brouhaha over Metallica not winning a Grammy Award?! The Metal Militia tweaked over an insipid, commercial accolade? Lame...\\"     Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the supposed anti-establishment bands being indoctrinated into the establishment if they want. It's all good and I want to see talented bands succeed and make money. But if you then go on to release a legion of dog albums afterwards and sell out so completely that you become tough guys for the RIAA crusade against mp3 copyright infringement, your credibility tanks a bit. There's a slight disparity between the early and \\"mature\\" Metallica, to say the least.     In any case, I don't mean this to be a rant. Regardless of the road these gents traveled after \\"...And Justice for All\\", this album is quite good and - along with \\"Master of Puppets\\", of course - represents the Metallica I knew and loved.

B000YABYLA|5.0|I saw this movie at a medical convention. In the discussion afterwards, there was a wondrous tendency on the part of all these very serious souls to treat this movie as if it were either a depiction of real behavior or a prescription for appropriate behavior.<br />I notice a similar tendency in some of the negative reviews. This is a movie-it 'moves' in a world of story-telling in which the most rational behavior or the most humane attitudes don't always make for the best story.<br />It's curious that this critique-by-morality is brought out for a movie that has to do with teen sex, but never seems to arise about a film like [[ASIN:B000XR9L50 3:10 to Yuma (Widescreen Edition)]] in which dozens of people are blown away by gunfire. Finding the lead character's emotions or speech or choices offensive is not the same as critiquing a movie.<br />That said, this is a witty burlesque of adolescent life. The dialog is relentlessly clever and the depiction of the longing for parenthood all too poignant and real.<br />An excellent piece of screen-writing that takes very little very seriously, Juno is oddly uplifting if you remember \\"it's only a movie\\".<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of the equally uplifting [[ASIN:1601640005 bang BANG: A Novel]]
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This album will have you groovin' from start to finish. My personal favorite - \\"Woo\\" -  is a great example of the creativity and variety on this album. Just press \\"play\\" and let the music move you. If you don't have it, go get it. It's an R&B/NEO-SOUL lovers' must-have!
B0013D8LOK|3.0|When watching Tim Burton's adaptation of Sweeny Todd for film, one cannot help but compare it to the Broadway production with Len Cariou and Angela Landsbury, and the fact is that, despite some great camerawork, impressive scenery, and outstanding performances from the supporting cast, Depp and Bonham-Carter were poor choices to play the leading roles.  Let me say from the outset that both Depp and Bonham-Carter possess considerable acting talents, and both have done some fine work with Burton.  Considering the earlier success that these two performers have had with Burton projects, they are a let down here.    Starting with Depp, one cannot deny the fact that Sweeny Todd is a baritone role, not a tenor role.  Depp's voice only rarely achieves the level of darkness and bitterness that one expects from Todd.  While on one hand we have to credit Depp for not trying to distort his natural tenor voice into an artificial baritone, one other hand he insists upon recreating his annoying effeminate faux-English accent that he used in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  When one hears his voice one imagines a young fop looking for mischief, not a wronged man returned from the penal colony seeking bloody revenge.  Although his voice and accent appear inappropriate for the part, one has to give Depp credit for making the most of what he has to work with.  He steals every scene he is in and clearly relishes the role.  Moving on to Bonham-Carter, her voice is also inadequate for the role.  Granted, it is a bit unfair to compare here to Angela Landsbury, who really made this role her own in the early eighties, but even without comparing her to Landsbury, you cannot look at Bonham-Carter or listen to her sing and imagine that she is the clever gritty widow that we know as Mrs. Lovette.  There is no combination of the matronly love that we are supposed to see in her interactions with  Todd and Tobey and the bitter jealousy and longing for revenge that are supposed to occasionallypeep their heads.  Furthermore, unlike Depp, Bonham-Carter seems to take no joy in her role.  Her lines have no flair; her witticisms have no spark to them.  To me Mrs. Lovette was always there to provide a bit of comic relief - granted it is a gallows humor, but humor nonetheless.  We don't see this from Ms. Bonham-Carter.    The above criticism aside, this is still a film well worth watching.  The supporting cast does a fantastic job.  Both Jamie Bower and Jayne Wisener have fine voices, and Ed Sanders does a remarkable job as Tobey.  Sacha Baron Cohen was perfectly cast as Adolfo Pirelli.  Special credit needs to be given, however, to Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall as Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford respectively.  Rickman plays the epitome of legal self-righteous hypocrisy, and, although his role is fairly small, Spall is flawless in is portrayal of the sycophant to Rickman and the pompous official to everyone else.    The best part of the film, however, is the music.  I am not a fan of Broadway, but do enjoy opera, and this is by far the most operatic of Soundheim's works.  I do not envy the editors who had to trim away several numbers from the original score in order to find the film into the standard movie length.  Given the onerousness of their task, I think they did an admirable job, eliminating most of the play's weaker musical moments.  I do regret that the duet between Anthony and Johanna was not there to show off Bower and Wisener's talents, and I also think they could have left in the opening number - Attend the Tale of Sweeny Todd.  To me the highlight of this film was Lovette's number \\"Down by the Sea\\".  It combined the music with some of Burton's surreal camera work and a masterful job by Depp virtually sleepwalking through Mrs. Lovette's idyllic dream.  Also memorable was Depp singing \\"These are My Friends,\\" where we get a hint of what goes on deep inside Todd's head.  On the whole, this is an admirable film, well worth watching, I would argue thatDepp's merits outweigh his deficiencies.  The only bad performance is by Bonham-Carter, and her performance would best be described as unremarkable rather than awful.  That said,  if you are a fan of the musical, particularly the performances by Len Cariou and Angela Landsbury, than you can't help but be a bit disappointed by this.
B000GALEOU|5.0|a product of the jazz fusion era that became an instant hit and over time a classic. can't get much better than that, should not be missed in any serious jazz archive.
B000QQFKYE|2.0|Truly the most challenging movie I've ever seen. I was baffled and confused. Why couldn't I understand what was going on? Where was the plot? WHAT was the plot? The movie seemed to be about something, and then it wasn't. It was moody, atomospheric, dreamlike, surreal, and extemely disturbing. I was intrigued at first, and then finally, in the end, just angry for wasting so much of my time and energy on it. I searched for the meaning of it, and read some things that helped me, although not much. But seriously if one has to go through all that trouble to make any sense of a film they just watched---well, then this is the perfect film for you! Good luck and don't say you weren't warned.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a great movie. I own it and bought one for one of my best friends. We laughed and teared a bit. Hilarious and so cute.
B0010X745K|1.0|I'm an old-school fan of some of Steven King's old-school work. I was terrified by \\"The Shining.\\" In fact, I could not shower with my eyes closed for about 5 years after I saw that movie. I kept seeing that rotted old lady in my scary involuntary fantasies for years. This movie, however  was absolutely terrible in every sense, It was  poorly acted, predictable, and ultimately disappointing. The movie never gets to the origin of the problem, and when we kinda get a feeling for what happened, it continues to it's inevitable terrible ending. If I thought raising a fuss at the video store would make a diff. I would certainly try to get my money back. This movie Sucks!
B000ZK4466|5.0|`The Mars Volta' return with their 4th album, `The Bedlam in Goliath'.  Like their previous releases there is a story behind the album and if you have a spare hour, and I do mean an hour, you can read the full thing on their website.  Basically its all about a oogi (check spelling) board Omar bought in Israel.  Bad things began to happen and they all thought the board was cursed and in order to get rid of the curse they had to bury it.  The question is did this make or break the output on the record?  Well here is my take on things...    The general feel of the album is a kind of heavy punky prog.  Think back to all the heaviest parts from previous albums.  Those parts make up the majority of the record this time round.  Therefore I would say compared to previous albums where they covered a wide range of sounds, mixing quiet and loud parts creating and also having different styles of songs.  This album focuses more on the one style and that style is predominantly loud. The irony of about this is that Cedric and Omar left `At the drive-in' because the other members wanted to go down the punk/rock/pop route while Omar and Cedric wanted go in a more progressive/experimental direction. With `Bedlam', it's like they made it to show how far they have come musically since `At the Drive-in'.  They can still do the punkier rock songs, but now they are a lot more polished and expansive than before.  Even though it's a heavier record, Cedric does no resort to his old At the Drive-in days where he shouted the lyrics.  The vocals are brilliant because the bursts occur a lot more often throughout this album. I just wait with great anticipation for the next vocal explosion to occur.      I would go as far as saying this is MV's most accessible album to date.  A big statement I know and one in which would lead many of my friends to laugh a lot as they really don't think they are capable of making an accessible album! But the way I look at it is all the tracks have the same feel tothem and relatively speaking it is easier listening than many of the songs on previous albums.  Moreover, on each of the previous albums there have always been parts which are weird and take a long time to make any sense.  However there are not really any parts like that on `Bedlam'. While I don't think this album will bring in any new fans as it still has `The Mars Volta' sound all over it; I think it may actually put off older fans who fell in love with the band  due to the experimentation (weirdness) and pushing the boundaries of their music through the variety in their sound.  The other albums usually took me at least 20 listens to understand and I use to relish the challenge of `getting it'.  This album took me about 5 listens and if it was a computer game this would be MV on easy mode.  I think the album would have been received brilliantly if this was their debut as compared to ATDI it's a big step up and would have acted as a great transitional record between the two bands.  But when you compare `Bedlam' to the previous 3 albums the quality is there, but in terms of progression and experimentation it feels like a step back.  In saying that it is just that even though it was easier `to get'; you will find yourself listening to it just as much, if not more than the other albums.    The main highlights of the album for me are tracks `Metatron', `Goliath', `Agadez', and bonus track; `Candy and a current bun'. `Metatron' feels like a continuation from track 1; Aberinkula which acts as a great builder/introduction.  Cedric instantly kicks off `Meta' screeching the vocals \\"Maybe I'll break down\\" oozing passion and charisma.  `Goliath' has got my favourite riff on the album. Furthermore Omar's solos on this track are edgy and frantic which really does some up the song.  Most notably around the 4 minute 30 seconds mark and again at 6 minutes 40 seconds where the track seems to go into orbit as Cedric's vocals go into hyper mode. `Agadez' is underpinned by a funky bass line delivered by the one and only Juan Alderete. When I first heard `Candy and a current bun' I thought it sounded like a proper old school punk track.    Funnily enough I later found out it actually was!  It is a cover of the early Pink Floyd song. Cedric changes his vocal style here to one I can't recall him doing before.  Each lyric is delivered purposely and precisely with a swagger attached.  There is a funky keyboard part which acts as great closer to the album.  I have since listened to the original and have to say that TMV make the original seem very ordinary and pedestrian. `Ilyena' and `Tourniquet Man' are the slow chill out songs on the album.  However someone didn't tell that to new drummer Thomas Pridgen as he still drums at the same ferocity as the other tracks.  This was clearly deliberate though as it does work a treat.     Overall, `Bedlam' is a great album.  How a band can make an album with 13 tracks on it lasting 78 minutes feel like mainstream punk/rock/pop/prog record; only TMV know.  They are genius, they are not going to go away and they are not capable of rehashing the same three chords on every album.  These are extremely talented musicians with the creative force that make them one of the most fresh and exciting prog bands on the planet. I'm looking forward to their next album already...    PS. - Just a warning for people who return to listening to this album after a break from it.  Do not say `I m going `Back to Bedlam'', as people may laugh at you and you may lose all music credibility you ever had as `Back to Bedlam is an album by James Blunt.  Don't say I didn't warn you!
B000R7I3LY|2.0|How many times has this happened to us all?  We love the song we've heard and hope the whole album will inspire similiar feelings... but alas... Sara has a lovely voice, and her lyrics are cute and catchy, but I just can't seem to hold on to this album... I've listened to the whole thing several times now hoping to warm to it... ah me... just buy the one track as an mp3 is my advice.
B000MV90IU|5.0|Just a great movie. Good acting and plenty of action. Wish Steve was still around.
0452289963|5.0|I bought this book in order to follow along with Oprah - but found myself reading to the end. I am now so conscious of when I am becoming angry or frustrated - and with what? It is not generally with anything but thoughts. I hope we are indeed moving to becoming an enlightended society.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I listened to this CD out of curiosity after hearing \\"Love Song\\". There is not one miss on the whole album. The lyrics are intelligent, and the melodies/hooks are consistently captivating. It's one of the year's best, and I'll be buying it, even though I already have unlimited access to it via Rhapsody To Go.
B00000G3I2|3.0|This DVD version of The Big Chill, has the same problems that I find on most of my discs and that is POOR audio.  This is especially true with a DVD Movie that uses Music as a large part of the experience, such as The Big Chill.  When the background music comes up, I have to turn DOWN my volume because it becomes so Loud and when the Music stops, I have to turn UP my volume in order to hear the actors and what they are saying.  This is a good movie with the same old problem that the Studios have not corrected on most of the older DVD's.  I have even experienced this with some of the newer ones.  I would think this is correctable, if a little time and money were spent on it.

B000UX6THK|5.0|We are about halfway through the series at this point.  We love it.  I canceled our dish network last June so we have no television at our house.  Twin Peaks has helped to keep us entertained.  Love it.
B0000CBHOI|2.0|Save your money and instead borrow this set from your local public library.  There is nothing about any of these DVDs that you'd want in your permanent collection.  I guess I was hoping for more of a well organized documentary and less \\"filler\\".  I mean, how many shots of BB King staring quietly out of his bus window do we need to see?  This whole series is a collection of disconnected, rambling pieces that could have been better organized.  All the parts are probably there, but it's like handing the viewer a pile of jigsaw puzzle pieces and saying \\"here's a nice oil painting\\".    This mess has Scorsese's name on it for marketing reasons only.  It's clear that, other than the single DVD that he directed, the only message the other directors got was \\"put something together about the blues\\".    Out of the 900+ minutes of video here, I'd estimate that there are about 240 minutes worth of interesting material for the blues aficionado (I'm not talking just music here; for example the thread about Rosco Gordon was touching and worthwhile).  The majority is senseless filler.  Who cares about a rap musician's interpretation of a blues classic?  Who cares about Clint Eastwood playing his piano?    A much better approach to this would have been to start with the roots of this wonderful music, and then highlight notable musicians and performances in chronological order.  Connections of \\"who influenced whom\\" and \\"who worked with whom\\" would help tie it together.  Sometimes presenting something in a simple, organized manner is the answer, rather than lathering every trick in the director's book on top of the project.
0810993139|3.0|While the story was mildly amusing I took issue with some of the attitudes of the main character.  He mistreats his friend, expects him to take it without question, and even gets angry with his friend for not taking the fall for him at one point.<br /><br />I understand that a lot of people cannot stomach potty humor, but at least the kids in Captain Underpants are not as bad as Greg.<br /><br />I am considering getting the sequel just to see if Greg redeems himself at all, but I think I will put it lower on my list of books.
0452286751|4.0|amazing work of philosophy wrapped in a novel.  ayn rand is standard reading for any new intellectual or objectivist.  The book is a great read for those looking to branch into something new.  I came from Dellilo, Vonnegut, Palahniuk, and most recently ayn rand's Anthem.  This was the next step, followed by Atlas Shrugged.  I recommend it to anyone looking to expand their horizons on what it is to be an individual living in such a large, homogenized world.
0805047905|5.0|I bought this when my son was about 4 months old.  Ever since, it has become my son's absolute favorite!!!  He is now 12 months old and still loves it!!  He will sit and flip through the pages by himself, or bring it to me, for me to read (all be it, not necessarily in order if he is turning the pages).  Highly recommended!!
0452289963|5.0|I am very happy I ordered this book.  I have found that I now have a better understanding of who I really am and the changes I need to make to live a more complete life.  I have also been attending Oprah's weekly ongoing, online book club meetings with Eckhart Tolle, which has been an enlightening, and awesome experience.

0316776963|3.0|True to his other works, 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is a collection of short stories chronicling various moments in his life.  However unlike his other books, most of 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' does not involve members of his family but rather focuses on his life in France.  Yes, the author struggles somewhat with the French people and, especially, the French language.  But unfortunately these stories, while not exactly boring, are too predictable to be really funny.  Somehow Dave Sedaris battling Dave Sedaris in France is not as interesting as adolescent Dave Sedaris fighting adolescence and his delightfully dysfunctional family.  And so I hope the author recalls or invents more stories involving his family, or I suggest he retire young and keep studying French.      Bottom line: David Sedaris deviates from his proven theme, must to the disappointment of this reader.  Not recommended.

B00132D808|4.0|and will probably take a few more listens for me to really get the gist of their new release.  But i can't compare it to their last cd, because its not the same.  They aren't the same artists or writers as when \\"A Fever..\\" was released.  Different life experiences and other things i am sure influenced Pretty. Odd.  While it hasnt totally taken hold of me and shoke me up.  I know that i'm already liking a few songs on this including \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" and \\"Just Folkin Around\\".  Give the cd a chance it's a departure from their previous work but i didnt look for this one to be like that.<br /><br />So do the same and just listen to this cd as a first effort from the Panic At The Disco guys and go from their.  i think you'll enjoy a bit more, maybe or maybe not.  But give Pretty. Odd. a chance at the very least.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|\\"Babel\\", outside of it's Biblical connection, is also a severe example of \\"what comes around, goes around\\". Or, you could look at it as an example of the \\"Butterfly Effect\\". However you do it, this is a good film!It is an example (to me) of how one mindless act, reverberates around the world, and affects so many people. There are the most tenuous of threads connecting these people to one another. It is also the decisions they make in the wake of this act, that fuels the story.    We first meet an American couple, vacationing in Morocco (?). As their bus begins climbing a small grade, the wife is shot. the wound is not serious, but in this part of the world, medical help is somewhat hard to come by, and that fact makes it serious. Meanwhile, in San Diego, California, a nanny/housekeeper is trying to make arrangements to go to a wedding, south of the border. Unfortunately, no one seems willing to relieve her of her two charges, a boy and a girl, who belong to the vacationing couple. Next we see a young, and somewhat bitter Japanese girl who is deaf, playing volleyball. She is somewhat estranged from her father, resulting from her Mother's death. Last, but by no means the least, are a family in Morocco, whose Father/Husband has recently purchased a rifle for a handful of cash and a goat, from a man who was gifted the rifle by a Japanese hunter.    It is from here that things begins in earnest, and we are witness to a series of bad judgements that fuel the tale. This could be any of us. How would YOU fare?     This film boasts some of the best actors of our time, Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Gael Garcia Bernal. This film will make you think about how anything you do, could affect people you don't know, and the consequences that follow. A very good film!!

0595440096|5.0|Rarely am I emotionally impacted by a novel to the degree I was with this one...  Still Alice by Lisa Genova.  It's a novel about a highly respected Harvard PhD professor and researcher named Alice Howland who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  It follows her from the first panic attacks of \\"where am I\\" and \\"what's the word I'm looking for\\" through the diagnosis of the disease to the time when nothing makes sense and she can barely interact with her environment.  You watch her husband's struggle to come to grips with the fact he's losing his wife and fellow researcher, as well as how much he should plan for his future measured against spending time with her knowing she'll not remember any of it.  Her three children are also pulled into the struggle, as two of the three choose to be tested for the mutant gene.  The third child, Lydia, is the one who didn't do things the way mom wanted (she wanted to be an actress rather than a college graduate), and they usually ended up getting in raging fights when they would visit.  But Lydia is the only one who really comes to grips with her mom's illness and makes peace with her towards the end of her lucid times.<br /><br />The author obviously did her research well, as there are many accolades from people intimately connected with the disease.  The characters are so real, and you could truly exchange places with Alice and experience what it would be like to know you were losing touch with everything you were, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.  And while you may not necessarily agree with her husband's choices, you can't help but wonder how much different you'd be if you were in his position.  And then there's always the \\"I forgot so-and-so's name today...  Am I going down the road that Alice traveled?\\"...<br /><br />I started this book last night, and finished it this afternoon at lunch.  I really couldn't put it down (or wait to get back to it).  With Alzheimer's so prevalent these days, it's likely that you will be impacted by it at some time with someone you know (or yourself).  This book should be your first step towards starting to understand how life is completely changed by EoAD...e impacted by it at some time with someone you know (or yourself).

B000VL9XE2|4.0|This album is really good many people talk about this album like if they slow down or something i mean it's pretty heavy but songs like black bubblegum and mouth of ghosts are on the down side,black bubblegum is a pretty good song tough the first time i heard it i was like na not that good but the more you listen to it it gets better.Miss machine was better than this one but ire works is a good album if you like dep than get this altough the last song is not that good.Dillinger escape plan is just a metal band from the future their older stuff might have been heavier but this still rocks.This is just crazy metal heavy,futuristic,wild,insane,and just COOL!

B00111YM5G|1.0|Like Skin Walkers, this movie is just another low brow turf war flick with a super natural element added in so it'll sell. The big angel demon special effect is....

I probably paid more to buy it, then they did to make it.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root were to me the quintessional Jane Austen couple; He was restrained,somewhat stern as a ship's captain would be,she becoming the ultimate spinster,certain to finish her life as a nurse-maid aunt. Her two sisters as annoying and vain as her father. Other versions have been made,but,to me this was the best.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I get really sick of the reviews for DVDs on Amazon, because all I see are a lot of Roger Ebert wannabes posting their opinion of the movie as it was shown in theaters. Sometimes, it looks as if these people are dropping reviews all over Amazon in some vain hope that the New York Times editor-in-chief, in their search for the newest film critic, will browse Amazon and say, \\"Gosh! Look at that great review, right there! I want that person on my staff, pronto!\\"<br /><br />I digress. My point is that reviews here on Amazon have taken on a life outside of actually reviewing the product being offered, like this movie on DVD. A lot of us saw \\"The Mist\\" in theaters when it was released and there were scads of reviews offered at that time. Adding to those seems ridiculous, when the product at hand is a different thing altogether.<br /><br />A tip for my fellow DVD reviewers: People come here wanting to know about the DVD's quality, the extra features, the additional footage, and the alternate version on the disc. They don't come here wanting to know what all you mini-Eberts thought of the movie. Please, for the love of all things decent, review the DVD on the page, NOT the movie you saw in the theater!<br /><br />That being said, this is a nice DVD set and it offers quite a few reasons why you want to go with the 2-disc set over getting the cheaper 1-disc version. The primary bonus is getting the film that Frank Darabont wanted to release in the first place: A black-and-white version of the movie. This isn't just a \\"turned off the color\\" version, either, but a well-made, contrast-balanced, tweaked and specially designed for black-and-white version of the film. The effect this has on the movie is astounding. The monsters are more frightening- Probably because you really can't tell they're CGI when they're not in color. Something about computer color makes CGI look \\"more fake\\" than it is, and this version of the movie makes a strong argument for releasing more CGI effects-heavy movies in black-and-white. Perhaps if \\"I Am Legend\\" had been designed for black-and-white, it wouldn't have ended up with such cheesy-looking monsters.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD is excellent. Both versions of the film look great when upscaled for HDTVs, and they hold up well in the absence of a Blu-Ray or other HD version. The special features are pretty standard fare, but they're done well if you're into that sort of thing. The \\"controversial\\" ending (which I loved) remains intact, and I applaud them for not wimping out. Not all movies need to be happy-happy at the end.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked it in the theater, then this is the (current) definitive version to own on DVD. If you haven't seen it yet, and you're not one of those losers who \\"won't watch black-and-white movies\\", then I recommend watching the black-and-white version of this FIRST. It's what the director wanted in the first place, and the studio talked him out of it, but it really does make the movie all the more frightening and effective.white.

B00004TJWE|5.0|I never heard of these guys until recently, and listening to the album makes me wonder why.  This is a great album - I mean the whole thing is great, and it's meant to be listened to as an album. If you like the British psychedelic rock of this era such as Pink Floyd: Piper At the Gates Of Dawn, Tomorrow's Self-titled album, Beatles Sgt. Peppers, The Move, The Kinks, etc. you will love this. At times they actually have a little harder edge to them than the aforementioned bands. There are some pretty heavy (for that time ands place) guitar licks on here amongst the pretty vocal harmonies. The whole album flows nicely and there are some cool effects used, although always tastefully and skillfully.  Goood stuff!

B000IOM1Z0|5.0|THE TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD is Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson's treatise on people's addiction to gambling, as well as on the general tendency among people to take too many risks in their daily lives. This domestic remastered version should be purchased with with the reissues of EYE IN THE SKY and I ROBOT. Those three albums, easily the most cautionary in the APP catalog, warn against the dangers of acting without thinking and jumping on unhealthy trends, and have inspired me to hang up pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent to such unhealthy behaviors. This CD is a must-own both for fans of high-quality, well-recorded rock music and for people who tend to end up in too deep from their own poor choices.
B000UW8596|5.0|\\"SALO\\" is the most controversial film ever made, after \\"Deep Throat.\\" Children are kidnapped and taken to a mansion where they are subjected to S&M cruelties. They eat feces and are raped and killed. Of course what you see isn't real. But it is enought to make many people sick to their stomach. Well, it's a movie, that's all. Just keep thinking to yourself, it's not real, it's not real. For mature adults only.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I have owned Blackbird for quite some time, and can honestly say, in my opinion, it is the greatest Rock album of the last 10 years, and that is a bold statement considering some of the quality albums that are out there from some outstanding bands.     On Blackbird, Come to Life, Rise Today, Blackbird (one of top five rock songs ever written), One by One, Watch Over You, are Hard rock anthems for the ages.  Just brilliant.  The rest of the songs are excellent as well, like Buried Alive and Brand New Start, and the Ties that Bind.      Miles Kennedy's vocals are outstanding, soulful, and lift you out of your seat.  Tremonti's work, is well, Tremonti- Is there a better guitarist playing today? The solo in Blackbird is one of the greatest solos in the history of rock and roll, and needs it's own review from an experienced guitar player, I think.     Their management and label need to sink some serious money into marketing.  Not enough people know about these guys, I don't care what anyone says.  This album shoud be a multi million seller.
0307341550|5.0|This book is powerful. The book is dark and disturbing, I almost hated turning the pages because I never knew what was waiting ahead. I couldn't help myself from turning the pages though, because this story is very addicting. Gillian Flynn makes you feel the pain of the characters, which is often a difficult task for authors to accomplish. I enjoyed this book in a sick and twisted kind of way. I definately will buy future books from Gillian Flynn.

B0013FBS20|1.0|The primary question is why? Why make a third adaptation of a truly horrifically boring movie? (Face it, when Vincent Price's $17 production is more compelling than Will Smith's 63 GAZILLION dollar special effects extravaganza, something stinks.)    Great, so you're the last human in New York City. There's 10 million zombipires, you, your dog and some bacon you were saving for later. Wonder how this will turn out?    Don't bother.    And \\"one of the best movies of the year?\\" Step away from the bottle please! This is a legendarily BAD MOVIE. Nothing to see here. Move along.

B000ZN802W|5.0|The reason why I seldom write movie reviews is two-fold.  One, I seldom have time for movies.  Two, I seldom find movies worth writing about.    INTO THE WILD is not only worth seeing, it is worth writing about.      A recently graduate top university student and athlete, Chris McCandless, has a thirst for meaning, truth, adventure, and exploration.  Upon graduation, he donates all of his money and sets off into the wild.  His ultimate and final destination: Alaska.  During the course of his journey to Alaska, you experience his many pains, pleasures, and pitfalls.    Most interesting is the many colorful individuals that Chris McCandless meets and befriends in his journies.  I somewhat envy him because I would love to explore the United States more and get to know my fellow citizens much better, each with different, unique, and fascinating stories.  Americans are good, decent, and interesting people.       The movie will impact you emotionally and intellectually; it will inspire you to question, to think, and perhaps even to love more.  You will taste a bit of Chris McCandless's sense of exploration and adventure.      The only problem? I must now read the book.  I was going to not write this movie review until I read the book, but I decided that I did not want the book to impact my movie review, as I would compare and contrast the two.        The movie is worth seeing.  It is worth talking about.  It is worth thinking about.  It is worth writing about.  HIGHLY recommended.      I hope the above was useful for you.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|The trailers for \\"The Mist\\" made me shudder for all the wrong reasons - I thought, \\"here's Just Another Horror\\". But now, having seen it, I can report that \\"The Mist\\" is - in places, at least, pleasantly surprising, and overall, isn't half as bad as you might think.    The plot isn't anything out of the ordinary, and you could be forgiven for assuming that Steven King and screenplay writer Frank Darabont copied and pasted scenes from \\"The Fog\\" and \\"The Birds\\" to come up with this : Freak storm gives birth to a thick mist blanketing the town, and spews out numerous beasties that corral a group of people in a local supermarket - including David Drayton (Jane) and his son Billy (Gamble), their neighbour Brent Norton (Braugher) and local religious zealot Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). Escape seems hopeless and the locals become more and more restless as their numbers slowly decline. Et cetera et cetera. But \\"The Mist\\" wisely goes more for a Hitchcock-style suspense feel than a Carpenter all-out-horror motif, and this, frankly, saves the movie from itself.    The acting's pretty average, with some good performances (Thomas Jane, Frances Sternhagen and Andre Braugher), some great performances (Marcia Gay Harden, Nathan Gamble) and - of course - some truly lousy performances by histrionic extras (\\"There's something in the mist!\\", \\"It's in the mist!\\", \\"No wire hangers ever!\\", and so forth. Well, maybe not that last one, but you get the picture....). The screenplay (by Frank Darabont) is competent and nicely paced - within fifteen minutes we're in the thick of the action (although this does cause somewhat of a drag around the midway point, but hey, by then you've been watching for an hour, and another hour won't kill you...) - and, histrionic extras' dialogue notwithstanding, the script provides a functional, utilitarian dialogue that forwards a well-made, suspenseful movie. The ending is unexpected and very, very unsettling - and definitely contributes a great deal to my three-star rating.    Direction is very good, there's one supermarket-in-chaos sequence just before the movie's mid-point that is very nicely done, and the special effects, surprisingly, are absolutely fantastic. CGI is well-animated and unpretentiously showcased, and while there are one or two points where the beasties look fake, the mist itself is convincing, and the creatures, for the most part, look plausible.    The biggest problem with \\"The Mist\\" is that it's not very original. I haven't read the story that spawned it, but this movie version doesn't really do anything new. It retreads some very familiar waters with competent polish, though, and if you're in the mood for an undemanding suspense/horror movie with plenty of decent elements to it, this might be just what you're looking for.    Recommended for rental - unless you're a huge King fan, in which case this two-disc version is your best bet.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|I really did not expect this quality of sound compared to all Queen concerts I have listened. I was afraid of buying another Queen concert with poor quality in sound. Probably you might not find ever another one that is better.  So if you are a Queen fan, this is a MUST.  Actually the video also it's the Queen's best.... you will not be disapointed..
B00102F5WK|1.0|\\"Rendition\\" is a very odd movie experience. It's got a cast of A-list reliables, a multi-award winning director and a provocative topic as its central plot. It should have been a fantastic, thought-provoking look at the U.S. Government's treatment of terrorism, but instead, it's an unfortunate blend of three insipid storylines tied together with one of those horrible Pulp Fiction-style chronology twists, and it doesn't manage to do anything interesting or say anything original.    Egyptian-born Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Metwally) is apprehended by the C.I.A. upon his return to the United States. CIA bigwig Corrine Whitman (Streep) believes him to be responsible for a terrorist attack in Africa which killed a U.S. Government official and, despite the lack of any evidence, she returns him for torturous interrogation to the country of the attack. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., his pregnant wife (Witherspoon) mounts a missing persons campaign that reaches all the way to Washington, and in Northern Africa, reluctant CIA operative Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) does his best to assist Anwar's plight.    Performances are full of gusto all-round - it's particularly nice to see Reece Witherspoon actually acting (albeit not brilliantly), in a film whose plot doesn't centre on how lovely-girls-attract-lovely-men, and Metwally and Gyllenhaal give decent turns in their respective captive/captor roles. Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor are good as Fatima and Abasi - even if the strained nature of their daughter vs.father / left vs. right relationship is left largely unexplored. Unfortunately, Streep is surprisingly underused, and what's there of her performance is unconvincing and one-dimensional, and Moa Khouas as would-be terrorist operative Khalid is childish and annoying.     \\"Rendition\\" has an appalling script. The badly-written dialogue splits into three distinct threads: the bleeding-heart pleading of Witherspoon versus the crusty flintiness of Streep and her officials, the \\"Why-did-you-do-it?\\" repetitive torture of Gyllenhaal's scenes with Metwally, and the foreign language dialogue - which, reading the subtitles, is as lukewarm as the rest of the film, but, since it's not in English, one could be forgiven for thinking it more impressive than it actually is. Unfortunately, the wishy-washiness of the script mirrors the blandness of these three plot threads, and none of them is resolved with any kind of spirit or originality - nor does any of them manage to make you really care about the characters or events they're describing.    The characters are not developed well - if at all: the only one who seems to go on any sort of emotional journey is Douglas Freeman - and Gavin Hood's direction, particularly during the torture or terrorist activity scenes, is insipid and unoriginal.     This is a movie made for previews: in a two-minute synopsis it looks an awful lot more impressive than it actually is. What is actually is, is a fairly bog-standard political message movie, and one that doesn't have the drama and entertainment of \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" or the excellent characterisation of \\"The Valley of Elah\\". Whatever your political stance on the perception of terror, this isn't a film that will either make you think or force you to engage with its protagonists.     Not recommended.

0385336810|4.0|I like every book of Sophie Kinsella I've read so far. They are highly entertaining, funny, easy reading and relaxing. Unfortunately \\"Can you keep a secret\\" is not an original book. Its protagonist, Emma Corrigan, could easily be Rebecca Bloomwood's twin sister. They look the same, think the same, act the same, work in similar environments and fall in love with the \\"same\\" man (highly succesful businessman from their work enviroment, who laughs with their antics). So this book is more or less a variation of the \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" (to be honest, I think I liked this version better than COAS's!).<br /><br />If you put the similarity aside, and the fact of course that these books aren't meant as studies on english literature, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a light read and busy moms like me who want to relax and have a good laugh. Romantic, Cinderella type story, this is not a book for cynics or down to earth persons. Kinsella is the best chick lit author right now and thus entertainment is guaranteed whatever book of hers you read. I certainly plan to read more of her books asap. Until now, \\"The undomestic goddess\\" is my fave followed by \\"Can you keep a secret\\".
0679882820|5.0|Review by Sherry North, Author, [[ASIN:0810994828 Because You Are My Baby]]<br /><br />This is the rare kind of read-aloud book that transforms the child from passive listener into active participant. As Mr. Brown makes his wide variety of animal noises and other sound effects, both parent and child can't resist joining in. My 4-year-old and I enjoy competing to see who can sound more like an owl, a clock or thunder.
B000GBEWHA|3.0|Well of course Grease is a great movie, so no probs there... But when it gets to a song, it sounds like a bad studio recorded version-- so you're somewhat taken out of the moment/magic of the movie.  Maybe it was hard to convert to a DVD??
0060775858|4.0|Review by Sherry North, Author, [[ASIN:0810994828 Because You Are My Baby]]<br /><br />Goodnight Moon is a classic with good reason. The poetic text has a gentle, soothing rhythm that truly can lull young kids to sleep. The artwork seems a bit dated though. Every other spread is in B&W, and the color spreads have a very limited palette featuring a lot of orange and green. This simple art may appeal to very young children, even if moms find it lacking.
0375842381|3.0|Disclaimer - All reviews, this one included, are subjective.     Having said that, I came away from these three books disappointed. I was not familiar with Pullman's writing. All the hype around the recently released \\"Golden Compass\\" movie supposedly promoting atheism, prompted me to buy the trilogy. I had great expectations that were soon dashed. The movie, I might add, does not stay faithful to the ending of the first book. I will be surprised if the sequels don't wander considerably from the books as well.      Atheists will laugh at all the hoopla and tell you, point blank, Pullman's trilogy hardly rings true to the core beliefs of genuine atheists. Pullman is far too moderate, allowing much in his books to suggest spiritual and metaphysical ideals. Many, if not most Gnostics will find much here they are in agreement with. Agnostics would be confused and probably find these books too spiritual for their tastes.    I find it interesting that Christians appear to be highly offended by the much touted \\"killing of god\\" but the consensual sex between a 15 year old boy and a twelve year old girl (main characters in the trilogy) doesn't even earn a footnote?!     I suspect that much of the \\"bad\\" pre-publicity the movie received may have  been cleverly conceived by the financial backers of the movie. People are drawn to controversy. I was looking forward to more controversy. I found it to be rather bland in that respect.     I am a recovering Christian so I have some bias in Pullman's favor but I think he reined himself in, perhaps not wanting to be overly controversial. This too depends on your perspective. If questioning your long held religious beliefs is new territory for you then Pullman's writing might seem highly polemic to you.     One has to give Pullman credit for attempting to make the Church and even \\"god\\" the antagonists. Still, Pullman's \\"god\\" was amazingly benign after a slow build-up that ended in what I felt was a disappointing anti-climax.     If thisbook is supposed to be for children, I don't get it and neither will they. I suppose they are entranced by fighting polar bears, animal daemons, and good witches. Adults will probably not attempt to explain the deeper implications about \\"The Church\\" to anyone under the age of 14.  It doesn't take an atheist to recognize the truth's embedded here, sometimes hinted at, sometimes direct. Most of the \\"controversial\\" stuff (a thimbleful) comes in the final book and is pretty much a direct slap at the Catholic church. More than a few protestants would agree with Pullman's premise but that doesn't make them, or Pullman atheists.     I don't read a lot of fiction. I just so happened to be reading Follett's Pillars of the Earth at the same time. Though fiction of different genre, Follett is clearly a better writer. Honestly I got bored in several places in the Pullman and had to struggle to finish the books. Pullman wanders about at times, including things that seem somewhat irrelevant, the elimination of which might condense the trilogy into a more manageable size.     I feel the over-all climax takes far too long to develop and will probably leave some people feeling left up in the air. Pullman has his moments (arguably just enough) perhaps and there are some nice visuals (what the movie people saw) but otherwise the book just wasn't consistently gripping enough to hold my attention and completely pull me in. In my opinion this trilogy is over-rated. The 3 ranking is because 2.5 wasn't an option.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|i always applaud Michael Moore for going where so few other directors dare venture to. this Documentary focuses on the Subject of Health care and how the United States is Selective about sharing it whereas europe and other parts of the world are fair and reward there doctors,etc... on the subject matter and welcome all patients and everything is balanced. i enjoyed the depths and lengths that Moore went to. I dug the 9/11 tie in and the fireman being acknowledged. so many powerful moments in this film which were needed. a Good film and a must see.
B00104QSOM|5.0|People keep writing reviews about how nothing \\"happened\\" during the movie and how the movie led up to nothing.  To these people, take note of the fact that directors, at least directors who have the slightest artistic vision, try not to be so obvious.  If you were waiting for some action packed ending to this movie, which I don't really understand why anyone would want this, you missed the point, and the subtly of the movie.  Yes, the music was not subtle, but you should view the movie as it's own character.  I honestly thought the music in correlation with the movement of the movie was excellent.  It created a tension that was beyond anything I have ever expected from this movie.    Paul Thomas Anderson is a director who prides himself in underlying, subtle themes in his movies.  I think this is apparent from \\"Magnolia\\" which was the next to most ambiguous movie of 99', right after Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut.\\"  The fact of the matter is that if you want a straight-forward action flick, or a straight forward drama, PT Anderson is not your guy.  This is the same guy who did \\"Punch-Drunk Love\\", which I dare not try to analyze.    I often find that movies need a second go around.  I go into a movie with one notion and then I am, for a lack of a better word, \\"disappointed\\" with the movie.  I am not disappointed because it is a bad movie, but because I braced myself to see one thing, but saw something completely different.   I think the best example of this was seeing \\"No Country For Old Men.\\"  I was expecting \\"Fargo\\" and clearly this was not the case.  But after seeing it a second time around...well, you get the picture.      The point I am trying to make is that you should never judge a movie after only seeing it once.  This movie is really excellent.  I pride myself in seeing many, many movies in my lifetime (I am also pretty young), and I can honestly say that \\"Blood\\" falls into my top 10 favorite movies easily, maybe even top 5.      Don't be judgmental because the movie did not involve a shoot-out, or a car chase...I don't think Jerry Bruckheimer is in the business of producing artistic, thought-compelling films.  This is what many critics claim as being the \\"Citizen Kane\\" of the 2lst century.    Highly, highly recommended
0452289963|3.0|I don't get what the big hype is, however, I have read only the first 3 chapters.  Reminds me of a college psycology class.  Yikes!  I vow to finish the book and take the course on Podcast at Itunes.
1416955070|3.0|I'm about 250 pages into this book.  I have never written a book review, so bear with me on this.  Anyway, I picked up this book after finishing Holly Black's books; Ironside, Valiant and Tithe.  The author Clare references the characters in these books at least once.  Clary peers out a carraige window and sees Val and Luis.  Unbelievable!  However, at another point, Clare seems to use Black's words almost exactly, saying \\"people don't cry when they're upset or angry, but rather when they're frustrated.\\"  I know I saw that somewhere in Black's book, I just finished them a few days ago.  Looking at the acknowledgements, its clear that Black helped Clare a lot on this book, and perhaps Black enjoyed the references as compliments or praise.  However, the 'glamour' is also a steal from Black's book, and after a while, all the references seem to just demonstrate a lack of creativity.  The plot is dragging, the characters are a little plain, and not much has happened.  Some of the syntax and descriptions also seem a little odd.  Despite this, it has been interesting to read a book which also references a book I just finished, and while this particular book in the series is lacking, there is potential for a great story.  Hopefully City of Ashes will amount to that.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|First I would like to say that the production value of this movie is pretty high. If you loved the TV series you will love this DVD movie. Everyone (all of SG-1 heroes) have their parts perfectly played out in the usual style. My only disappointment is that Adria (played by Morena Baccarin) the main villain has very little screen time. I think out of the whole 102 minutes of the movie she has probably around less than 5 minutes of screen time. The plot is somewhat simplistic but it worked as the movie is on a time constraint and puts an inevitable closure to the chapters in the Ori storyline arc. Can't wait for Stargate: Continuum as it will be interesting how SG-1 will outwit and survive Ba'al's trickeries. One thing I have always wondered is what happened to the people of the various planets that were converted to Origin and now having their faith/beliefs literally yanked away from under their feet?
B000002JKS|5.0|When your resume is \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and \\"Kashmir\\", what do you do?<br /><br />And when your legacy is that of having been the front man to perhaps the greatest rock and roll/hard blues band in history, what's next? For Robert Plant coming off of the Zeppelin era, it began with \\"Pictures at Eleven\\", a nice radio-friendly transition with Zeppelinesque tracks fused with Robbie Blunt's roadhouse blues-based driving guitar work. It moved onto the peculiar Principle of Moments which swayed back and forth between AOR rock and atmospheric textures and ballads. Having played it safe for two records (along with the able assistance of Phil Collins on percussion), Plant broke loose with Shaken 'N Stirred.<br /><br />At first listen, I was devastated by how radically he had departed from normalcy and everyone's expectations. But as is always my rule, every record I purchase gets three listens in three different settings at three different times of day. After that, I love it or hate it. And for Shaken 'N Stirred, it must've been that third listen where things fell into place. (OK... maybe the fourth.)<br /><br />Yes, Little by Little is the commercial favorite with stunning guitar work by Blunt. The recording is largely stimulated by master keysmith Jezz Woodroofe and the delightfully surprising counter-voice of Toni Halliday on a number of tracks. Little Feet's Ritchie Hayward is shockingly out of his element and even more shockingly delivering some of the finest percussion ever heard on any rock record from the 80s (Peart would likely agree). Paul Martinez even involves himself more in the writing process, and his bass work is solid, not stale.<br /><br />\\"Hip to Hoo\\" playfully nods to brassy bands of the day like Asia and twists our ankles as we try to tap to its clever 6/4 rhythm. Meanwhile \\"Kallalou Kallalou\\" indulges in a rollicking Caribbean swing - it's the first \\"fun\\" song from Plant's solo work - who expected a dance number? And in the midst of it all, Blunt's guitar work exudes some Pagean swagger. \\"Too Loud\\" is a weaker stab at the emerging hip-hop sound of the mid-80s, while the ethereal \\"Trouble Your Money\\" delivers a sweet compliment to the \\"ska-gae\\" of the Police and others of the era. \\"Pink and Black\\" unloads a tour de force of drums and guitar with bursts of retro-sounding organ and closes with a very cool guitar solo influenced by old spy shows (Get Smart, anyone?).<br /><br />\\"That Side\\" (as the LP was labeled) begins with \\"Little by Little\\" which is rich in wailing echos and emotive textures as Plant (supposedly) speaks to his early post-Zep emotions. \\"Doo Doo a Do Do\\" takes us back to the Caribbean with the moodiness of dark discotheques and their pulsing hypnotic rhythms. \\"Easily Lead\\" easily wasn't Led Zep, but the energy and intent of the song is reminiscent if the overall sound is not. The chords in the refrain at first listen are unexpected - a nice twist (did you notice the vocal rif on 'Sea of Love' at the end?) Finally, we come to \\"Sixes and Sevens\\" which is musically gorgeous though lyrically ambiguous or, as Plant might say, \\"deep and meaningless.\\" The convergence of all the band on this song demonstrates exceptional writing and composition, despite Plant's coy lyrics.<br /><br />The reasons why people have a distaste for the record are tied to the presence of strong keyboards, the contrast of Toni's vocals to Plant's, the understated guitar and the abject lack of choruses - something Plant considered to be something of a creative sell-out in song writing (at the time, anyway). But this is more than Plant being 'experimental.' This record is about Plant being honest - musically and lyrically - about himself. Really: Here's a man that could do anything. Phone any guitarist in the world and likely start a new super-group and take off on another mega-stadium tour.<br /><br />Instead, Plant reveals in this record that his radio was on during the 1980s, and that there was a lot to like and a lot missing all at once. He's also openly rebelling here against all attempts to type-cast him as \\"the Zep guy\\" whose only professional hope is to regurgitate insincere renderings of Zep's greatest hits. (It's worth noting that his return to Zep material in subsequent tours was rooted more in his personal favorites than radio classics.) What happens on Shaken 'N Stirred is collectively mysterious and exciting. Going directly from Led Zeppelin 4 to this could hurt someone, sure. But in the larger context of all his creative works (even from You Better Run and Our Song), Plant has achieved something unapologetically amazing here. Yes, it has weaknesses, but they're compensated for in the spirit of adventure and the emotions and colors in this collection.<br /><br />That said, I invite the critics and low-score folks to dust off that tape or CD and give this record three more listens, in three different settings at three different times of day within a week or so. (Or, maybe four.) Listen to different aspects of each performance, not just the whole sound. Give it another chance and you may discover why Shaken 'N Stirred is - quite possibly - still ahead of its time...
B000WC3A0S|1.0|I was delighted to see the complete Rocky saga available at such a reasonable price on Amazon because my two kids had seen the first two films and were hoping to watch the rest. However when we rented them from our local place , they were very badly damaged and to buy new I felt was a bit of a rip off. Everything went well with the order and I received the package without a hitch. We settled down to watch the whole lot , popcorn , duvets - the works - only to find that the discs were not compatible with our dvd player. The kids were very disappointed and I felt let down . Maybe this was something I should have been aware of ,  but being a bit of an \\" Amazon Virgin \\", I didn't realise. I have since found that the discs do work on my very small and cheap tv/dvd combo , but it isn't the same as watching on a wide screen.    I wish that I had known this fact before I purchased , but I am now wiser after the event.
B00132D808|3.0|After giving this CD a few listens, I've come to the conclusion that it's not a bad work of art. The music is unique, some of it catchy, and all of it a stark contrast from their previous album and sound. Some of my favorites are Nine in The Afternoon, She's A Handsome Woman, and Northern Downpour.     This has been my most anticipated album of the year since PATD was my favorite band and A Fever You Can't Sweat Out my favorite CD. Now to the obvious and depressing part...this isn't PATD. I understand that bands mature and change throughout their careers and I support and encourage that. However, most bands stay somewhat true to their original sound and grow and mature from there. This CD is a 180 degree turn from their previous one and I'm not saying that it's a terrible thing but it has let down thousands if not millions of their diehard fans. If I wanted to listen to the Beatles or a band from the 70s, I would do so. The reason I liked PATD was for their creative, completely refreshing and unique sound.     After listening to Pretty. Odd a few times, I put in A Fever You Can't Sweat out and I couldn't believe the two bands were the same. Bottom line: this band has changed and completely gotten rid of the elements I liked about them the most. The intensity, emotion, and upbeat music is gone, replaced by a sound popularized decades ago. It's not a horrible CD but with all the anticipation surrounding this amazing band, I can't help but admit they let me down.
0345337581|5.0|I first saw these two on public TV in Los Angeles (channel 28) in 1979. They gave a simple list of ten words and asked you to remember them. You can always remember the first and last word and strange ones in the middle, but that was it. And then they wanted you to remember it in order -- backwards order! Then they gave their technique and had us remember the list again. It was so easy!  The list is actually glass, ceiling, Eiffel Tower, drapes, roses, door, tree, elephant, street, ashtray. I had not recalled that list since about 1982 yet I pulled it out of my head just now and will remember it forever, just like pi to a few thousand places, every phone number every person I know ever had, every address, every car license plate, you name it. They make it so very fun.  I only wish losing weight was so easy!
B0016CQCMQ|4.0|So many albums these days fall into the \\"nostalgia rock\\" category, and this new one by the Raconteurs is no exception, but they are much better at it than average, and they throw in enough creativity and originality to make them seem far more than another ACDC cover band. Sometimes Jack White sound more like Jack Black imitating his 70's heroes in a movie, but that's ok. It's a fun album.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Well, yes, that's true.  This is one of the great classics ever produced.  I already own the original version in full frame on DVD.  The reason that I gave this 4 stars is simply because they cropped the movie from top and bottom to make it widescreen.  It's not true that you won't see the characters heads.  Yes, you lose a little from the picture, but then so you do if you play the full frame version on a widescreen TV and you set the TV to \\"widezoom\\" instead of 16:9, because if you set the TV to 16:9 you will see everything \\"flat\\".  So you need to set it to a more normal aspect ratio, which in the Sony case it's called \\"widezoom\\", Philips has the \\"Zoom 16:9\\" and \\"Zoom 14:9\\", others have other names for that setting.  When you watch the movie like that, in order to fill the entire screen, you will lose from top and bottom on a full frame movie.  However, with this movie, they didn't simply just cut the movie from top and bottom.  They did an entire re-working of the film, where they take it frame by frame and they cut from top and bottom where there's unimportant stuff on the screen.  In other words, if you have a scene where the character is shown more on the top of the screen, and you have a rock or grass, or something else on the bottom, then they will cut only from the bottom enough so that it fits on a widescreen frame.  In other scenes, they will cut accordingly, so that you won't lose essential stuff that must be seen.  Therefore, if you're trying to make a decision whether or not you should replace your original, full-frame DVD of this movie with this new widescreen version, I guess it all comes down to how much of a movie buff you are.  If you really really love a classic, an original, then you will stick to the original full frame if you already have it.  If you just want to own a copy of this movie, and you own a widescreen TV and you adore new technology, then I suggest that you buy this new version.  They made it to fit just that profile.  Me - I already own the original full-frame DVD.  I've watched it on my widescreen TV and it looks fine.  For more info and an outstanding review before you buy this version, check out:  [...]
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Eclipsing the first \\"Die Hard\\" and easily breezing past its first two, good-but-not-spectacular, follow-ups, \\"Live Free Or Die Hard\\" is one of the most exciting, most fun, and overall best action films to come down the pike in a long time.  This one takes quite a different tract than the first two, which confined their action to a skyscaper and an airport, respectively, and shoots, chases and slams its way over much of the northeastern U.S. seaboard.  When a series of precisely co-ordinated computer attacks start bringing down systems and power grids all over the country, Bruce Willis (returning as John McClane once again) finds himself drawn into the thick of it - largely by coincidence as usual - and in his best race-against-the-clock yet.  Sidekick role this time goes to Justin Long, a small-time hacker initially arrested by McClane and subsequently helping to piece together all the clues as to the villains's identities and ultimate intentions, Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's daughter Lucy and is as great as always, and Kevin Smith has a couple of brief but scene-stealing appearances as cyber-wizard 'Warlock'.  The whole cast does great in this and makes a few scenes that might have otherwise been just Too unbelievable manage to work.    Speaking of brushes with the unbelievable though, those who like their action movies as realistic as possible might find that the forth Die Hard goes overboard a couple of times.  There are some darn close calls even for McClane in this one, and probably nearly as many as in all three previous Die Hards put together!  Most times, this kind of thing, with disaster constantly being averted by uncanny combinations of sheer coincidence and plain luck, will send an action movie skidding right off the tracks.  Live Free Or Die Hard was one of the few where it didn't, and may have actually turned out to be a boon, adding to the fun and larger-than-life feel of the movie.  At times it's reminiscent of the 2003 Denzel Washingtonmovie [[ASIN:B0000VJG72 Out of Time]], although that one is more dark and intense, and Live Free Or Die Hard more of a grand rollercoaster ride.    Overall, unless you just dislike action/adventure movies altogether, Live Free Or Die Hard is one of the safest bets out there.  Those who find it a bit too over the top are still likely to enjoy it for the most parts, while those who don't think it went too far will just be blown away.  Before they did this one I thought it would be a bad idea to do another Die Hard.  After this I hope they go ahead and do a fifth.  When you can deliver this kind of a winner nineteen years after the first one you've got something really good going.  Scores around 9 or 9.5 on a ten point scale.
0452289963|5.0|This book is a real transformation, it's the best book to put ego under spotlights & allowed for an indepth self examination which is the first step into awareness & consciousness.  This is better than \\"The power of now\\" which gives less focus on ego games & role plays, where ego is the clearly the greatest enemy to being in the NOW.  I advice not to miss the opportunity to go into TRANCE by listening to the audiobook (read by Tollee himself), where you experience his calm, wise voice & convincing tune, a persuasive tune that takes you to many moments of AWE ! far better & more elighting that reading.

B000003BD3|5.0|This is a great CD, I really enjoy The Who's performace of 'A Quick one While He's Away' Taj Mahal's 'Aint That A Lot Of Love.'  I play this CD over and over again.
B000PC1N54|5.0|Alagna is superb . The rest of the cast stands tall with him in this magnificent production.  The final scene leaves the audience fully satisfied and pleased that they have experienced something very special!
0060763280|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  Mr. Eker spells out the power of production and manifestation in easy to understand language.  His principles, whether he is aware of it or not, closely mirror many of the spiritual premises that can be found in [[ASIN:1432720805 The Spoken Words of Spirit: Lessons From The Other Side]].  I've recommended this book to many of my friends, family and more.
0307277887|4.0|Dexter is a serial killer mostly likely to bring you donuts. Blending in with the rest of the world is not difficult for him any more since he has been practicing all his life. With his camo in place and his other skills sharpened he is ready to take on Miami.<br />I liked the book better than the recent TV show. Dexter has a great personality... a fake one anyway. The story is fast paced and hard to put down at times. The ending is well written although a bit telegraphed. I enjoyed it enough to buy the second in the series to see where it all leads.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|This CD is for everyone.  Glen and Marqueta are the perfect duet, sometimes humerous, sometimes conpassionate; their music is not just \\"another song\\" but an emotional experience.  You will be laughing or crying when the music ends.
B00110K62U|5.0|All I can really say is that you MUST get this dvd.  It's wonderful to come back to this music again.  I had forgotten how amazing it is(of course, we community theatre peeps were going to kill ourselves if we heard yet another \\"On My Own\\" or \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" for auditions).    Now my daughter is singing \\"Castle On a Cloud\\" like I did when I was young.  It warms my heart to share this musical with her.  It opens up many life conversations and opportunites to be close.    Buy it now, you won't regret it.  To hear and see this music performed the way it was intended is an experience like no other.    Philip Quast as Javert wins my vote for best performer.  I could watch him sing \\"Stars\\" and \\"Javert's Suicide\\" over and over again!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|\\"Once\\".... a great movie, with an \\"addicting\\" sound track. Every song on this CD is meant to be played over and over again.  There is a song for every occasion - from romantic to party.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|Another Wes Anderson movie, unfortunately they get worse one by one.  This movie is basically Royal Tennenbaums II, except set in India.  Owen Wilson is the same pretentious, faux-humility character as always.  The scenes sputter along, with a lot of dead air, and dialogue about nothing imparticular.  There is a vague gloom and sense of failure, again,  and a screenplay that could be written over a bottle of $6 chenin blanc.  Also, the intro \\"short film\\" was utterly dreadful and pointless.  I'm sorry, but this is vapid garbage.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|A great movie.  How long would it take you to realize that a zombie invasion was taking place in your community/life?  I think we all walk around in this same haze throughout our lives.  But social commentary aside, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" rivals all of the other zombie flicks out there.  It truly stands alone as a satire/horror movie. When it needs to be funny, it delivers.  When it needs to be gruesome, it also delivers.  One of the few horror films that takes the time to develop the characters in the film.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|I love clapton and this cd has it's moments, It needs to rock a little more.
B0015KO52S|5.0|If this doesn't end up as the best album of the year, then this is a very very good year.  The Raconteurs deliver an cohesive, polished but not overproduced, joyous experience.  This time around the band has clearly gelled.  Rock, blues, country and folk elements abound.  The singers are in excellent voice.  The band is clearly having a good time and it's great that they invited us to the party.    Every song is good in its own way -- they are not all singles but there are no tracks that you will want to skip.  Truly a treat.  Hope I get to see them live this time around.
B00122M2QU|4.0|This is the best album to come out of the Soulfly/Sep crews since the first Soulfly and Roorback.Some of Max's guitar parts are a bit repetitive like the most the Soulfly stuff(let the reigns loose on Rizzo),but Iggor's drums are great and the sound is like an updated Nailbomb/Soulfly with a very slight hint of early 90's Sep.Nothing groundbreaking but a solid metal album that any Cavalera fan should get.<br /><br />*Update 6/8/09:After living with this album for a while the excitement has worn off and I think I can add something more.this is really just a 3 star album.Everything on it's good but,like so many Soulfly albums,it gets boring because of a lack of lyrical substance and songs that aren't very memorable.It's like Max is trying way too hard to appeal to the younger metal crowd with lyrics that are angsty and not very deep and music that isn't very challenging to listen to--if that's seriously where he's at and that's his thing,cool,but come out with an album that has more substance and staying power occasionally.Some of us old school adults from the 90s have jumped ship in favor of contemporary rock radio,but I still think we're you're core fan base guys!They ought to write some lyrics from the heart about things that matter to them in their lives rather than worrying about conforming the lyrics to metal standards.The urgency and honesty in the lyrics just doesn't seem to be there and while the usual \\"metal song topics\\" were well-suited for Sepultura in the early years...some of these guys are pushing 40 years now.I'm not saying \\"grow up\\";I just wish that they(of maybe the label)wouldn't pigeon-hole themselves into the extreme(but conventional)metal scene,left to make album after album which become increasingly void of honesty and filled with more music that doesn't have much staying power.I expected that the addition of Gorija's bassist would lend a more technical,epic,or focused hand to the table on this album but,while there are slight elements here-n-there of Gorija's sound,I can tell that Max wouldn't allow for much straying from the Soulfly formula.That's pretty much what this album is--Soulfly minus all the add-ons(electronica,world music influences,etc.).If they wanted to make a straight-up hardcore/metal album(which is what it seems like from the Black Flag-inspired logo)they should've made it meaner and more serious.<br /><br />Pantera,Sepultura,and Slayer were probably the biggest 3 bands that layed the foundation for the extreme metal scene in the 90s,but in the 2000s these bands' sounds have become more and more diluted and seem increasingly forced.Take Pantera's \\"Re-inventing..\\":awesome songs on it but in tracks like \\"I'll cast a shadow\\",\\"We'll grind that axe\\",etc.I can feel the lack of the same enthusiasm as in earlier albums.The spark faded.Slayer's \\"GHUA\\" and...wow,I really can't even remember the name of their last one;those had 3-4 tracks with awesome music but the lyrics are plain and seem like they were written in a single afternoon.Sepultura actually did their best to avoid this by getting a new frontman after Max who could sing AND scream,but up until \\"Dante\\" and \\"A-Lex\\" their albums had decent lyrics that were more insightful/personal,but the music was usually uninspired for a good 1/2 the album at least.Seems like the key for the Seps has been to start doing concept albums because it doesn't require as much focus on coming up with lyrics that are often doomed to become re-tread of the last few decades;they can focus more on the music because the lyrics come from the source material.<br /><br />Anyway,in a nutshell I think what CC should try to do is jump ship on the conventional route that metal has taken in favor of a more free approach.I'd MUCH rather have Max and Iggor make an album that might have reggae,electronica,and some lyrics that most \\"fans\\" would ignorantly label \\"lame\\" or \\"wussy\\" than yet another extreme metal album that's sounds awesome for the first few weeks you have it until the \\"new factor\\" wears off and you're stuck with another OK metal album that you might listen to a few times a year.They don't need to totally puss out but,honestly,I bet that most of us who are out of high school can sense that their music is being held back by conventional limitations.Unless those limitations change or are ignored I don't see stuff like \\"Inflikted\\" being marketable in the future to anyone over the age of 18 who has more expectations than \\"scream about the same topics and make music that i can learn in a few days\\".I'm done with predictable metal.f and you're stuck with another OK metal album that you might listen to a few times a year.They don't need to totally puss

0767817664|5.0|I really love this movie and I been wanting it on Blu-ray for awhile now the price was alittle steep but it was worth it for me I really love the picture and sound quality too they did a very good job and the extras are good also, no complaints from me
0307276902|4.0|I was referred to this book by an old friend of mine who got into doing drugs until they finally overcame his life. I had just gone through a bad phase myself and was now cleaning up. He was not. He told me 2 things: 1. you need get your life together. and 2. if you want to understand how i feel and what my life is like read this book. And told me about James Frey and a million little pieces.     The script is very monotone and dry and the writing is very different than anything else I have read. It was refreshing. Frey has a great way of explaining exactly what he was thinking.     I don't care if people don't believe in what he says and all the controversy. I read it before that all went down and didn't pay any attention to it. When you get off drugs your memory isn't going to be perfect and you just relay it the best way you know how.
B000I0RR76|4.0|The 3 strip technicolor is glorious; it looks good on the SD DVD and better here. The resolution is so good you can clearly see the house on the hill behind the archery field! Ripping good story. A real classic; the kind you will watch several times.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I must say when I first bought this CD I was disappointed. I only listened to two songs on it(Almost Easy and Scream) then skipped through the rest of them. I then however went to the Rockstar Energy Taste of Chaos show featuring Avenged Sevenfold and was blown away by their performance! They performed every song from this CD and it gave me a different perspective of it. After leaving the concert I listened to the CD again all the way through and realized that the entire CD is great. If you're one of the people that is disappointed with this CD then go see them live in concert and I guarantee you'll leave with a different opinion of it.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the last 5 years.    Ignore people who gave this one star, this is a fictional movie, yet very powerful.  I saw it in the theater and then rented it from Blockbuster and it had been edited.    Watch for the scenes of torture, with the people with black bags over their heads.    This and the Usual Suspects are the two non comedy movies that I could watch more than once.    Amazing movie.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The scenery and costumes were extravagance and rightly so,  nothing else would have worked.    Mr. Butler did   an excellent job as the phantom with a overwhelming presence .  Emmy Rossum was perfect in her part as Christine.  The music has a tendency to stay with you long after the movie has ended.  I am not the biggest of opera fan,  but  this is one that I will watch many times over.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|I am sort of a Ryan Gosling fan but I had not gotten around to seeing Half Nelson for some reason.  I think that I am often reticent to watch movies that are so dark because they can effect me more than I would like.    I am, however, glad that I was able to get over that and watch this film.  It was rough.  I have never had the urge to do cocaine or smoke crack but this movie would have killed even the slightest curiosity for me.  After watching this, I realized that drugs are glamorized more than I had been aware of because few movies were as uncomfortable to watch as this one.  Candy might be the only other one that comes to mind right now and even there the love story softened some of the hard edges that were left all over Half Nelson.    In addition to the discomfort imparted by Dan's drug use, there was an uneasiness I felt about his relationship with Drey.  The tension was perfectly done.  The possibility of the friendship between them becoming something unacceptably inappropriate was an undercurrent that kept it from feeling saccharine.  This was my favorite aspect of this film and I think that both Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps did a fantastic job at maintaining that tension.    The movie had some really funny moments, too, which I appreciated.  I think that Ryan Gosling was just amazing.  He managed to do some pretty despicable things and be a pretty pathetic character without alienating the audience.  When he does something positive, he is so conflicted that it seems believable and genuine.      Really, just a great film.  I think that Gosling creates Dan and gives him life and the rest of the cast of the film create the world that he lives in very convincingly.

1416550518|4.0|The House at Riverton by Kate Morton is a leisurely, well-crafted book that is told in alternating centuries. It is 1999 and Grace Bradley is ninety-eight years old. She is living in a nursing home and is approached by a historian who is interested in making a film about something tied to her past.<br /><br />As a young girl Grace worked as a servant at Riverton House and she was immersed in the lives of the family she worked for, particularly, the daughters Hannah and Emmeline. During the early years there was a death, a reported suicide that has been a mystery for decades. However, in 1999 the only one left who can tell the true story is Grace. She is taken back to Riverton House to relive and remember what occurred on that fateful night.<br /><br />The House at Riverton is told in flashback sequences that allows the reader to relive the days that Grace spent in that home. We are also given vivid historical descriptions of those early days of the 20th century. I recommend this work to all readers interested in a well-told story filled with history and family secrets. Reading The House at Riverton is a wonderful way to spend a leisurely weekend at home.<br /><br />Angelia Menchan<br />Author, Reviewer, Publisher
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is one of my favorite old movies.  Of course, by today's standards it is quite corny, but for its time it was outstanding.  The music is wonderful, and the story is timeless.  Watching it again so many years later is a pleasure.[[ASIN:B000AYEL1A A Star Is Born]]
B000ZN802W|5.0|I have read so many negative reviews of this movie, and they all say the same thing. They all rant on about how stupid Chris was and who would do what he did, etc. Well you know what, we all have been reckless or idealistic in our lives and most of us did not have the courage to act on our impulses. Chris did. The end of a character assasination.  Now let's get on to the movie. Brilliant directing, excellent acting, beautiful cinematography, very close to the book, believable, very real characters in a real world, and a very interesting story. This movie has everything going for it. If you are sitting on the fence about something you read, just take a chance and watch it. Get over the opinions about the person right or wrong and look at the story. Here is something to think about while you watch:  \\"If you have a highway on Everest, you don't meet the mountain. If everything is prepared, and you have a guide who is responsible for your security, you cannot meet the mountain. Meeting the mountain is only possible if...you are out there in self sufficiency\\"- Reinhold Messner.   Some of us \\"get it\\" and if you do, you will think it is one of the best films you have ever seen.
0143038419|1.0|Fond as I am of a good travel memoir, and fonder still of Italy, Indonesia (Bali, specifically) and India; I was induced to buy this book on the recommendation of someone in a favorite book store.  I would like to find that person again, and shake them until they tell me just what about this book was enjoyable.  I learned nothing about Italy, Indonesia or India, and way, way too much about Ms. Gilbert and her orgasms.  Perhaps that's what people like...the hope that you can be incredibly self-absorbed and insensitive, and yet you still will find someone to love you!
0143038419|1.0|I tried, I really tried to get through this boring, self-absorbed thing, but somewhere at mid-point I just said to myself 'enough already!'There are too many good books out there to waste my time! Don't waste yours. I could go on, but even a more detailed review is not time well spent. The book is just not worth it.
B000GUJYRE|4.0|I am not a classical music expert, but even a novice has heard at least portions of the 5th an 9th symphonies in their lives.  This recording doesn't have have the embellishments that the typical listener might be used to.  And that isn't necessarily a bad thing; the toned down approach used by Haitink allows the listener to pick up the nuances of the compositions that would get buried under more dramatic interpretations. This is best exemplified in the 9th symphony: during the Allegro Ma No Troppo, the dramatic, emotional strings and horns commonly heard are absent, putting the chorus and the orchestra on a level field and allowing the listener to choose which one to turn the ear to.  So if you are looking for loud, melodramatic versions of these symphonies, this is not the disc for you.  If you want a more \\"by-the-book\\" treatment, this set is a good pickup.

B00133KFGW|5.0|It is a rare movie that can be predictable and sentimental, but still be heartwarming and touching, but that is exactly what August Rush is.  August Rush has an amazing cast including Freddie Highmore from \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", whom has proven to be one of the most intriguing young actors of this generation.  He has yet to degrade himself as other young actors like Dakota Fanning have, he sees no need to prove his artistic credibility, because he is just great as he is.  It is his performance as the orphaned child August Rush that elevates this film to a whole new level that it would not be at with an actor of lesser capabilities.<br /><br />  The story story takes cues from Oliver Twist, but don't expect a straight-ahead modern adaptation, but the elements of Oliver Twist are to pick out if you have read the book or are familiar with the story, but it is not a direct adaptation.  In August Rush, a young cellist named Lyla, whose father keeps her on a short leash, falls in love with an Irish musician Louis, and has a one-night stand.  Through events that neither of the characters wanted they are separated, but Lyla has become pregnant from the encounter, and loses the child.<br /><br />  The bulk of the story revolves around Evan Taylor AKA August Rush, who is on a quest to find his parents by following the music.  The movie is rich with excellent music, it is a rare film that can utilize music in such a poignant way.  Music is a universal language, and this music shows us how music speaks to us and is used to communicate.  As a musician, I found this movie absolutely enthralling, but even my tone-deaf buddies loved the music and the story and heart behind the movie.<br /><br />  Don't be turned off of this movie because of its lack of promotion or critical hype, it is one of the best movies to come out in the last year and is a welcome departure from the confusing art house movies and bloody horror movies that litter the market today.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyhe market today.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had never purchased a Jillian Michaels DVD before b/c of the hit or miss reviews. So when I heard raves about this one, I decided to give it a shot and I am so glad I did. This is an absolute butt-kicker workout. I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser (I work out 5-6 days a week) so I figured I could see what Level 1 was all about and move onto Level 2 right away. Listen to me folks--these workouts are HARD. Level 2 was VERY difficult--a good difficult though, very challenging. When Jillian tells you to start at level 1, listen to her she knows what she's doing. I've been at this for about 5 days, and I already feel a difference in my body.  Jillian is tough--absolutely NO rest in this workout (not even for a sip of water) but that's what makes it go by so quickly, and it makes your body change, according to Jillian. You're done before you know it--but by the end you've gotten a kick butt workout and feel like you've really done something. She bases her workout on the 3-2-1 method: 3 mins strength, 2 mins cardio, 1 min abs. Her strength circuits remind me of Jari Love--compound exercises that work the upper and lower body simultaneously. The cardio is good as well: a lot of jumping, so watch those knees (she has a modifier for beginner and lower impact) And the abs is straight up ab work--a variety of crunches and twists on the floor.  This is a great workout and I find Jillian to be tough but she's pretty likeable. Be warned though: she's no-nonsense. I think it's funny when during the stretch she admits she's not flexible and struggles to reach her legs on the floor. I thought \\"Ha, Ha, finally something I'm better at than Jillian!\\" lol  If you really want to get a good workout and to jumpstart your weight loss get this DVD you will not be disappointed. It's great for those who are short on time too and want to try something new; every workout is just under 30 mins!
B0002JP4L4|4.0|Good movie overall, in my opinion.  The way it was made is most of the appeal (music written for the plot), but the plot resonates too.  There are a lot of religious people who act like the people in this town, trying to keep bad things from ever happening.  But being straight-laced comes way too close to straight-jacketed here, and in a fairly stereotypical way.  They could've used a little more balance in the religious things, but for the purposes of the story it isn't that far from usual.    The kids don't realize it in the movie, but the reason parents are hesitant to allow complete freedom such as teens desire is proved by their own actions here.  In the movie dumb things happen and no one gets hurt, but in reality it is much less certain.    Nevertheless there is much to like about Footloose.  The special features are nice to watch and very instructive also, with an interesting back story.

6305127646|5.0|\\"The Saint\\" starring Val Kilmer, is perhaps Hollywood's best effort yet to produce an action film that is of interest to someone other than just 16 year old males.  The story is witty and engaging with plenty of twists and turns to keep the viewer interest.  The great disguises that were created for Val Kilmer's character and his techno gagetry add to the films \\"bond-esque\\" feel, while the romance with Elizabeth Shue's character is both engaging and central to the story, rather than an \\"eye candy\\" afterthought.  It is the perfect date movie - something for both, car chases, suspense, things blowing up, and romance, humor and witty dialogue!  Plus the movie features a KILLER soundtrack that both adds to the film and is a good listen on it's own.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|If you haven't seen Dirty Dancing, don't read my review because it contains spoilers.      I like this movie, in spite of the stupidity of sex outside marriage by one girl right after another girl almost dies from an abortion.  (Gee, it couldn't happen to me, could it?)  The lead female gets 'exposed' to a lot of immorality, finding her 'true love;' along the way learning to lie, cheat, and steal but still winding up happily ever after?  Typical Hollyweird.    The dancing leaves something to be desired also, unless you count sex standing up clothed as dancing.  They do better with some of the standard ballroom stuff, which looks classier and less like hookers advertising on the boulevard.  There are decent resolutions to some of the plot lines, and overall it is an enjoyable if cautionary tale of youth with just enough knowledge to get themselves in real trouble.  The music is pretty decent too.    If parents and kids watch it together then at least this fable could be used for teaching lessons such as why passion is not enough on which to build solid relationships or the terror of abortion.    The special features of the ultimate edition are very interesting and instructive, except for the slobbering over the gay director who died of AIDS at 50.  I like to watch interviews and 'making of' specials with my kids and grandkids because I want them to know just how much fantasy goes into a film, and there is a great deal in this one.

B00005JPUN|1.0|For the most part, I detest hollywood doing remakes of classic films. They almost always lose something in translation, as does this version of The Body Snatchers.  They completely lost the mark here. The camera trickery did not add to the tension, it disarmed it. The flash forwards and flashbacks didn't help to keep the story in line. The opening flashback, we find out later in the film, was not a THE critical moment. For this version I think THE critical moment would have been when Nicold Kidman walks into her son's bedroom and pauses, waiting to discover if he's changed or not. The two face each other for minutes before disclosing anything. Now that would have been the critical moment.  And the ending!!!! Please! Sappy sappy sappy. In each and every other version of this paranoid, claustraphobic thriller the main character ends up succumbing to the force greater than it. What could they have been thinking here?? It's actually an insult to the story.  The original is the best. The third version, with Meg Tilly, is actually quite the thrilling interpretation of the story. The second version was a bit on the lame side, but kept the story. This one lost everything.  I found it interesting that they brought in an actor from the second film to be the wife of an early victim here, but it didn't help.  Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time. See the original or the third version. Those are the best.
0618918248|5.0|If there is an atheist trinity, I would put Richard Dawkins as the patri, Sam Harris starring as filio, and Holy (Christopher) Hitchens is cast as spiritu sancti. They through their various books formulate the most cogent and compelling arguments against a belief in the supernatural, which includes, a belief in God. Dawkins, in \\"The God Delusion\\" poses the tough question, of why do we give such respect for religious ideas? Few serious scientists would take seriously the myths of Greek Gods, Zeus and Appollo, but because people actually believe in the just as improbable myths, why do we by default give respect to \\"men of faith?\\" A fair question.<br /><br />Dawkins goes through all the reasons why people have articulated why there must be a God, and he pretty much shot down all those reasons, atleast within the paradigm of scientific reasoning. He spends alot of time talking about the Abrahamic religions and their God, Allah and Jehovah in great detail, and I think, soundly diagnoses the angry tribal God of the Old Testament as someone who shouldn't be worshipped, but thrown into solitary confinement. He also takes on the New Testament and the Quoran, showing that the deities presented in these holy books is not that much better than the Old Testament lunatic.<br /><br />Particularly, he mentions that scholars of Islam, just like Christians do, have the problem of contradicting scriptures. In Islam, they solve the problem by putting greater weight on the later scriptures and less on the earlier ones. The result is, that those who teach Islam today give only passing attention to Mohammad's early career, when he talked of peace and unity, and focus on his later writings which were more dogmatic and militaristic.<br /><br />Dawkins also does a good job of explaining the fundamental differences there are between a scientific intellectual paradigm, and one based upon faith. Unlike some scholars (Stephen Jay Gould comes to mind), Dawkins argues convincingly, that a truly rational person, can't think rationally in one context, and then think superstitiously in a different one. Notwithstanding the large number of great scientists who were men of faith, Dawkins paints a picture that these scientists succeed despite their faith, not because of it.<br /><br />Dawkins in discussing the two paradigms, also points out the different roles criticism plays in science and faith.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I purchased this album soon after the song \\"Gravity\\" was released on the radio. I have always been a John Mayer fan, but I never realized the talent behind the face until I got this album. This man is truely one of a kind. The way his mind works just amazes me. I know every word, to every song on the album and love every single one of them. I could not recommend this enough to someone who enjoys letting themselves get lost in the music they listen to. Bravo!
032147404X|4.0|[[ASIN:032147404X The Digital Photography Book, Volume 1]]    I have been an enthusiast of the digital camera for the last three years.  Although I am self taught I decided that it is time to slow down investing my money into the photo equipment and start to invest into the post processing and knowledge in general.    I decided to get this book based on the reputation of Scott Kelby.   My overall feeling is that this is an excellent book for a novice wanting to know more about digital photography.   I found that just about 80% of information in this book I already poses and use every day when shooting. I did find a couple of gems in this book and will keep it as a recipe book for future reference. For instance there was a simple guide to making a nice background glow for a wedding photo portrait. That was very useful. Just the thing that I needed and also the reason why I decided to buy the The Adobe Photoshop CS3 Book for Digital Photographers by Scott Kelby.    I am one of these unfortunate souls that do not identify with Scott's sense of humor but it is easily overcome by skipping a page or so every now and then.    In conclusion, get this book if you are new to digital photography. Get this book if you want to have a recipe book and want to reconfirm your knowledge on things like framing your photos, choosing subjects, overcoming common problems, choosing the right accessories etc. Do not get this book if you are a seasoned photo enthusiast or professional as there will be no value in it for you    Regards    Peter    PS I am currently reading Volume 2 of this book and find that there is more stuff in it for me... more on this will be in the review to of Volume 2 book
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Five stars isn't enough for this fantastic DVD (except for the talking interludes on the first disk. We aren't into all those extras that are on so many DVD's. Just give us the upfront stuff!) We weren't really that much into Garth before this set. But now we listen to several of the disks at least once a week. The photography and audio are great! And we don't know if the Irish are better at karaoke than Americans, but the audience singing on the Ireland disk is superb.     We could go on and on, but instead of that: If you're a Garth fan, you have got to have this set! If you aren't a complete Garth fan, you will be after you watch this collection!
0790729725|3.0|\\"Good Fellas,\\" I think, is the definitive movie about the Mafia in the U.S. It's beautifully done; the acting and direction superb. The settings and the mise-en-scene were brilliantly prepared. Unfortunately, the subject is so repellant that watching it is about as satisfying  as watching a cat torture a bird to death.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|I ordered this in HD but received it in Blue Ray. So I returned it and hoping that it will be returned in HD
0143038419|5.0|This is a book that I could personal relate to and completely and utterly enjoy. It is not just that you get a description of what it is like to break up with a guy (a husband and a guy), that you read through tons of arguments, why you should get a treatment against depression and why you should not, get to share all the intimate moments of this brilliant writer, in her greatest despair, funniest travelling incidents, most wonderful and outwordly experiencing of sheer joy and happiness.  You travel with her. It so happened that I do think like Liz Gilbert does, but could probably never write it down the way she does, with thousands of witty metaphors and giggling examples, always being earnest to the bone! Imagine a woman in her mid-thirties, that does not fulfill the ideal of a woman in wester patriarchy, that is stay married and have kids in the suburbs, but instead wants to find out what the world means to her. And of course.. find true happiness! She ends up becoming the husband and the father she would want to have, developing all these qualities she would need and adore in another person and gets to the bottom of what and where God is! Because she does find God and true happiness! After eating her way through Italy and psychographing everything there, from the language to men and society, she moves to an Ashram and explains all the traditional ways of devotional practice, complete with Sanskrit names and vivid descriptions of the energy forces in your body and the universe and all the theories of Hinduism, Yoga and Buddhism, just by the side. And does not hesitate to add her very personal experience of the divine, like you will never find, in any meditation course or book, not so vividly, not so truthful and deeply touching. She heals herself and her divorce by meditating and sweating it away and it is a lot of work too.  Only to find countless soul \\"mates\\" on her way, that will support her and play the part of an objective and sound consciousness and help move to Bali, the final destination, which is described in fine details, as a wishful thinking of paradise on earth, which can actually work, since she does practice balance between enjoyment and devotional practice. Oh, and she does find the partner of a lifetime, real love, only the moment she gave up on that and was totally content with herself!  Countless encounters and messages, arguments and \\"events\\" keep you awake and accompany, yes indeed guide you on your way to your very individual enlightenment.  I knew most of these things, but never have I found them all together in a such a brilliant cosmotheory that encompasses all religions and so many aspects of human life.  After this humorous and exquisite narrative style, I 've become addicted to Liz Gilbert's writing. What kind of book should I read next? Will it be even in the slightest as exciting as Eat Pray Love?? I can only pray to have such Kundalini experience and I will continue praying for the best!!!  Thank's Liz!
B0000033J9|5.0|If you are a hopeless romantic, love beautiful scenery, have an interest in history and enjoy good musical scores you must see this movie.
B000O599WG|5.0|Very good, very fun, the very best. This movie is realy brilient. If you are a fan of westerns than you have to see this. It is funny, It has good action, it has good romanse and there are alot of cool gun fights. Every thing a western needs is in this movie. It also has very good acting.
0316067598|3.0|Marcus is a brave dude.  No doubt.  He and his fallen comrades are heroes: the finest warriors in the world.  BUT this book carries an undertone of paranoia that is stunning.  It seems the insane Taliban and wicked Al Quida terrorists are not as much to blame for his ordeal as the \\"liberal media\\", a term he uses repeatedly and in the most cynical and naive fashion.  Again, the man is a hero and his story is an epic struggle of survival.  My issue is that the America he's fighting and willing to die for is not the same America that I live in.  He sees the \\"liberal media' as another invader to be repelled, another hater of the American to be overcome.    I find that kind of writing incendiary and it takes away from the story he's telling making his epic somehow less heroic.  In a world where FOX NEWS, the Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch control much of the \\"media\\" we consume, it's just wrong to make the \\"liberal media\\" a boogie man equal to the lunatics we must fight for our very survival.    Plenty of \\"liberals\\" have died fighting for America, many died in 9/11.. we are all Americans united by our love of our country and our willingness to die defending her.  just as marcus and his comarades did.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Everyone must see this - it should be required viewing in every classroom. Renews respect for our planet.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I was really blown away by this film. The concept of a hand-held camera filming the whole thing was well concieved and well executed. It really made the film come across on a more personal level, yet it wasn't excessive.<br /><br />The creatures were truly terrifying and realistic. I hope that the Academy will recognize this with some sort of SFX award come Oscar season.<br /><br />The acting was what really impressed me, though. Unlike normal movies where the cast pretends the camera isn't there, these actors recognized the camera, and came across as real people in that situation. Very impressive ensemble.<br /><br />I know a lot of people hated it, particularly the way it ended. At the risk of sounding very corny; I found that one way to appreciate it more is to look at it as a sort of love story. If you think of the main plot line as the Rob/Beth relationship, with the monster attack supporting it, it really is a very good movie.<br /><br />Four and a half stars.
B0013K1ALO|4.0|This is great remaster  Previous released version \\"Dazed and Confused\\" \\"Moby Dick\\" was song cut and combined , that's uncomfortable  This restoration is good and no problem these songs  But one thing  \\"Rain Song\\" is alomost unchange although restored , why ?

0618918248|4.0|This book has not been a surprise for me since I have been following all that Richard Dawkins has published. I fully agree with the book's thesis and the arguments used but mostly with the idea that we atheist must show ourselves as an opinion force. It seems as if we do not exist. But we do. And we must get out of the wardrobe as other collectives have done.<br />Ramon Gomez de la Serna affirmed that to have faith is to chew without teeth. It is time to chew with the teeth that science has provided to us.<br /><br />Let me finish with a couple of curious anecdotes about God:<br /><br />A) In an occasion a professor told to the Spanish writer Pio Baroja:<br />- Consider the talent of V&aacute;zquez de Mella, who have found the seventeenth mathematical proof of the existence of God<br />Don Pio replied:<br />- Bah, the Jesuit Atanasio Kircher found exactly 6561 proofs; however, Laplace, who was not precisely unskilled in mathematics, could found none.<br /><br />B) All the animals spoke of God, though no one has seen it. The vultures imagined Him as somebody with black wings and the turtles imagined Him as somebody with a shell on his back. Only the horse imagined Him as somebody on a horse.<br />(German Sanchez Espeso)<br /><br />All my support to Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />Lamberto Garc&iacute;a del Cid<br />Zaragoza, Spain

B0010X73ZG|4.0|I'd bet this movie gets watched thru to the end more than most any other...the circumstances of the characters and their situation have the most to due with that, but the characters were interesting enough to get you invested in their fates. Great suspense thruout. Like some  other King books , this is another fascinating insight into human nature and tendencies when it appears your back is to the wall. King has such a knack for portraying peoples inner self and the dynamics of personalities in a very dire, very tense group setting. You do find yourself wondering, 'where would I find myself in this situation?', when one bad thing after another starts happening to the group and different personalities start rising to the fore,  etc...The monsters were fairly convincing, though we've seen better, they do the trick. Of the few critiques you could make, was that the overall production felt very slightly like a 'made for tv' movie, but that may just be because 90% of it took place in a single location, maybe something more, not sure...  The ending that so many seemed to dislike so much, worked for me, and just added an exclamation point to the movie. A tragedy yes, but tragedies happen every day in real life. Definitely recommend.
1596680296|5.0|I tried several other sock knitting books (with terrible results and frustration!) before I stumbled upon this gem.  This was the book that FINALLY made sock knitting make sense to me!<br /><br />The book begins with an in-depth explanation of the anatomy of a sock as well as all the skills that you'll need to knit one.  From there, it gives you several \\"recipes\\" to knit socks based on stitches-per-inch.  In the back of the book, there are also some nice patterns.  The book also gives you some different stitch patterns (different ribs, cables, etc) to mix in to your basic socks when you are ready to try something new.<br /><br />I read the entire introduction to this book to begin with, and then I made a swatch from some yarn I had laying around.  Based on the stitches per inch that I got, I went to the page of the book for the \\"X Stitches Per Inch\\" sock, and it walked me through my first top-down sock!  It was as easy as pie.  After many failed attempts with other books, I couldn't believe how easy this book made it.<br /><br />Note that all the patterns in this book are knitted top-down.  If you want to learn to knit toe-up socks, you'll want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to get started in sock knitting.  It's a great jumping off place.  This book helps you truly understand the shapes and techniques of sock knitting -- and once you have a firm grasp on those, the sky is the limit!
B0013XS8A2|5.0|After more than a decade of electronic music, Mike Oldfield does something \\"classical\\". The melodies in the album are niecely blended by Karl Jenkins, the voice of Hayley Westenra is simply amazing. To all the fans \\"Harbinger\\" will take them back to the beginning. A good all around album, closer to instrumental work than a classical one. Enjoy it
B0002IQEHI|1.0|While North By Northwest is supposedly a fantastic film, I would not know.     You see, I have purchased and returned three copies of the exact DVD being sold above.    All of them manage to play right up until the climax, and then they stop working entirely, pixilating and skipping to death.    Seeing as this has happened with all three... I can only assume there is a problem with this batch.    To avoid such heartbreak yourself, simply wait until the inevitable super-deluxe edition comes out; or, if you're desperate, rent the video.
B000003BF4|5.0|I am astounded by those so called \\"experts\\" reviewing this masterpiece who claim to have some sort of preternatural insight into its recording.  OK, maybe a vocal or two was/were overdubbed.  Big deal.  The inportant thing to remember is that THE GREATEST LIVE GUITAR SOLO(s) existant, the alchemy of Keef and Mick T on \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" is just as it was heard by those at MSG.  Somewhere down the list here, several \\"reviewers\\" comment that the Oakland boot, \\"Liver Than You'll Ever Be\\" is superior to \\"Ya Yas.\\"  It ain't (I OWN \\"Liver\\"), and mayber \\"liver\\" is the operative term there.  You know how this album/CD stands up next to \\"Still Borne\\" or \\"Stripped,\\" and I'm not going to make a pun about that last one typifying R Woods' ineptitude. This CD is all you'll ever really need, to know how the Stones once were...
0595440096|5.0|It's almost eerie how well this book draws you into the life, mind and heart of someone at the very early stages of Alzheimer's. Still Alice is the only book I've read cover to cover in one sitting since my first child was born 2 1/2 years ago! Lisa Genova weaves a tale of horror and, at the same time, humor and hope, as she describes how Alzheimer's wreaks havoc on a family yet also draws them closer in unimaginable ways. With a doctorate in neuroscience from Harvard, Genova is able to blend healthy doses of science (e.g. what sorts of symptoms appear first, how Alzheimer's is diagnosed, what drugs are currently used) with fine storytelling. An educational and heartwarming read that puts a human face on a devastating disease.
0061547832|1.0|The worst book I have ever read in my life. I can not understand how derogative he talks about people. I could not read the book to the end because it is garbage and this guy is sick. I regret every penny I spent on this book and I am sorry this guy wants to be an ideal for us!
0143038419|5.0|The sharing is a big part because when I purchased this I thought it was going to be another of those how-to-help-yourself books.  Instead, it was Elizabeth Gilbert's personal story.  I loved it and it made me want to abandon everything and follow in her footsteps! I liked it so much I purchased additional copies for both of my daughters hoping to inspire them to have the courage to recognize what she did.
0743486285|2.0|Nikki Sixx's struggle with heroin addiction in the 80's and temporary death in '87 is well known and documented. Now the Motley Crue bass player has come out with The Heroin Diaries: A Year In The Life Of A Shattered Rock Star, a revealing memoir documenting that one fateful year during the height of Sixx's addiction, supposedly culled from his own diaries and inserted with retrospectives of those around him during this time. There's even a soundtrack of original music composed by Sixx and friends coinciding with the release. Sound familiar yet? That's because it is.     Former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro came out with a book in the exact same format three years ago. Don't Try This At Home: A Year In The Life Of Dave Navarro documented....well, a year in the life of Dave Navarro during his peak heroin/cocaine addiction, through the pen of both Navarro and writer Neil Strauss (who witnessed most of the events documented in the book). Like Sixx's memoir of a similar title, pages from Navarro's own diary and essays are examined, and events are documented on a linear timeline with interjected retrospectives from friends, family, and Navarro himself for corroboration and perspective. The similarities don't end there. Both books share the same style artwork because they share the same designer: P.R. Brown. If that weren't enough, Navarro's solo album Trust No One was meant to serve as an accompaniment to Don't Try This At Home in 2001 before Navarro pulled the book off shelves just three weeks prior to it's release. At the time, Navarro had relapsed and felt it inappropriate to release the book considering the circumstances. Though the solo record came out as planned in the summer of 2001 and the book finally hit shelves in late 2004. By sheer coincidence, Nikki Sixx also has a solo album as an accompaniment to The Heroin Diaries. Both authors also donated a portion of their books proceeds to charities that help musicians struggling with addiction.    While The Heroin Diaries is certainly an interesting - and often frightening read; Don't Try This At Home comes across as more genuine, honest, and even artistic. Snapshot photobooth strips serve to illustrate the types of people that came in and out of Navarro's life during that time, as well as document his rapid physical and mental deterioration. Unfortunately, Sixx's memoir comes across more as a shallow opportunity to sell himself and his infamous past, yet again. Aside from the numerous songs and documentaries that covered Sixx's addiction and experience with death, that year in his life had already been documented by Sixx himself in another book: Motley Crue's 2001 rock n roll memoir, The Dirt. The journal entries Sixx had supposedly found in his attic last year that were included in The Heroin Diaries seem to be derived right out of The Dirt itself.     With all this in mind, it makes one wonder how much of the book is genuinely from 20 year old journal entries as claimed, or if it was written by Sixx and a ghostwriter more recently in an attempt to cash in on the success and format of Navarro's book. Also, considering the heavy amount of marketing and mass media promotion that went into all this, one can't help but wonder if Sixx's solo album - sorry, \\"soundtrack\\" -  would garner nearly as much attention were it not attached to the book.     Don't be mistaken - addiction is a horrible disease and anyone willing to open up personal wounds for public consumption in hopes of helping others is admirable. But it seems more like Nikki Sixx is interested in helping himself by ripping off Dave Navarro and his book.    Like just about everything he's done with his career in the past decade, this seems like yet another attempt by Nikki Sixx to rely on the past for success in the present.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I decided to go ahead and buy this movie because I thought it looked like kind of a fun movie from the previews.  Honestly it exceeded my expectations.  I really enjoyed it.  I really was swept up in the story and the romance between the two couples.  A suprisingly great movie!
B00132D808|5.0|Disappointed.  What can I say.  The youthful exuberance is gone.  The energy is gone.  The Dance element is gone.  Everything that made Panic! At The Disco unique is gone.    I should have gotten the hint when a Press review said \\"Forget everything you know about PATD.\\"  Then I was confused, didnt' their name have an ! in it before?    I don't blame the band, (hence the 5 star rating and I haven't even gotten to the music yet), I blame the Producer.  I have seen this before; that what made the band special stripped away, sanitized by the Producer's vision (agenda) for the band (Remember the Simpson's Poochie episode, \\"We need to Rastify it 25(?)% ..\\").    A band has every right to do what they desire with their sound and take on a new direction.  However, it is a betrayal of the fans to take such a 180 degree turn from the sound that raised them to near Rock Star status in such a short amount of time.  This should have been their 5th album, not their second.      In reading the other reviews, I see that I am not alone.  This band created such a special place in each of their fans hearts that no one dare be very harsh, but the disappointment is palpable.  I too, am a fan, but not the fan I was before Pretty. Odd. came out.    The album is not bad, just not exciting or engaging.  It reminds me of a Monkeys cover album or \\"A Very Brady..\\" rock album.  It is clear that they were striving to emulate a 60's retro sound (think the Beatles quirkiness as you can sense from the other reviews).  However, given that it was PATD, I would expect the most quirkiness of all time, lathered in clever lyrics, which it is not.      To be honest, had I known that this album sounded like a Beatles knock-off (among others), I simply would not have bought it, because we already have the Beatles.  I buy PATD because I like (the old) P!ATD, I like Dance music, I like the poppy punk element and I like their clever lyrics.  THAT IS ALL GONE, DADDY GONE, THE LOVE IS ALL GONE!    I hope that theband listens to their fans, and listens to their hearts and decides which direction that they want to go.  Who knows, maybe I will buy another P!ATD album again, but for now, I'm already selling Pretty. Odd.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|I purchased this item after seeing the movie, \\"Across the Universe\\", which I loved. To be honest, I never paid much attention to Beatles songs until I heard this soundtrack and fell in love with them.The way these talented artists perform each song is unique and thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys Beatles music and enjoys discovering new talent. The artists have beautiful voices and truly make this a \\"must have\\" addition to any music collection.
0679746048|2.0|This memoir, I must admit is quite a boring read. I watched the movie first, which some say is a travesty, but honestly, I believe if I had read the book first, I would not have wanted to watch the movie. The book is dull and lifeless and jumps around too much.    Although, this is a mimick of the illness she faced during her stay, it can be annoying to the reader. There is no indication of how close she was to any of the girls she befriended during her stay, although at the end you witness some closeness between Susanna and one of the girls that managed to get out, there is not a powerful pull here.    This is not a very englightening read. I suggest you skip reading this book and read something like Prozac Nation instead. Or, just watch the movie for this book, it's definitely better even if the events are not true.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|What a let down this movie was.  There is no dialogue for the first 20 mins or so.  The music score is overdone in this movie.  Often times its so loud it is distracting, other times it doesn't even match the scene that is taking place.  The movie goes no where for nearly 3 hours.  Yes the guy is obsessed with oil..so what?  I kept waiting for something more to happen and for there to be a point to this movie.  There wasn't.  The ending is terrible as well.  After 3 hrs of dragging a meaningless story along, there is an abrupt ending.  Glad I didn't pay for this dud.
B000002LCE|4.0|So why am i giving it 4 stars?  Sunset Superman and All the Fools Sailed away.  Sunset Superman is kind of tiresome.  Sunset superman is overly repetitive.  All the Fools Sailed Away is a really cool song if only they would delete the keyboard solo from the middle.  Otherwise, this is a very enjoyable listen.  Not on par with Holy Diver, but what is?

B0007DAZW8|3.0|I really did try to love this album, but it never happened. Now there is some really good songs on here and i really do love the simplicity of the instruments they used, and i really enjoy the the simple construction of the songs, but when its just the same thing over and over for 5 mins you kinda get temporary ADD. Human after all to me is the only perfect song, its infectious, its simple, but the song is good enough and changes up enough to make its a great simple sounding song. Prime time of your life i love to, it builds and builds but after 2:40 it builds to nothing! which to me is a rip off, but i still love it. Robot rock is really good to, but after awhile of hearing the same riffs and beats and nothing changes i say to myself \\"hey why does this song feel like 30 mins long\\"? Television rules the nation is another song thats really good but goes no where. Emotion, same thing as television, good but doesnt go anywhere after awhile, though I still like it. Technologic i didnt really like the \\"buy it use it integrate it\\" part, i would of liked it better with out. Steam machine starts off all right, but then gets hella annoying. Make love isnt half bad. The Brainwasher makes me want to kill something in a video game.    Overall i do like this album better than i did 2 yrs ago, sadly i sold it. Like i said I actually do love the simplicity of instruments and simplicity in the songs. I dont need 500 different sounds in one song or 20 different change ups, but when its just the same thing over and over again, something that sounded good for first 2 mins doesnt sounds so good after 5, and most of the songs arent good enough to be the same over and over again. Another thing i like is the darkness to everything, everything seems so metallic and far far away from being human which is nice cause you really gotta build your own connection to the songs. Sadly theres only 9 songs, i think ppl buying this album deserve alittle more.    In the end im in the middle with this album.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|What an amazing program.  The writing is brilliant as is the acting.  But more importantly the over all quality of this series is something you NEVER see anymore.  The thoughtful insightful details that went into this show, from the always present water theme to the overlapping and mirroring of the main character's issues is unheard of these days.  What a gem of forethought artistic endeavor and outstanding acting.  The actors are all a notch above anything I would have expected, even from HBO.  These are some of the most memorable performances I've seen on the small screen in a long long time if not ever.  So worth what ever it costs to have this in your library.

B000002VFW|4.0|Lisa Stansfield's solo debut pretty much showed that she was the UK's answer to Teena Marie; a Caucasian woman with vocals so soulful that you would swear up and down that she was black if you weren't looking straight at her.     The album is fantastic, and while it hasn't aged extremely well, that is okay. Standout tracks include the midtempo R&B smash, \\"All Around The World,\\" the thumping neo-disco cut \\"This Is The Right Time,\\" and the soulful house gem \\"The Love In Me.\\" That isn't to say that there aren't missteps on the album. \\"Mighty Love\\" is happy forgettable filler and the new jack swing-influenced \\"Poison\\" seems like a song that is too hard-edged for a sophisticated girl like Lisa and as a result, doesn't quite pull it off. Despite those minor faults, Affection is still worth listening to over and over again.
B00005MP58|4.0|This one is very very good, but the BBC 1980's version, with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, is better.  While I would give Colin Firth a slight - very slight- edge over David Rintoul, each is effective in his own way.  Elizabeth Garvie wins hands down over Jennifer Ehle, however charming she might be, and Fay Weldon, herself a Jane Austen fan and scholar, gave us the definitive Pride and Prejudice screen play in the 1980's version.
B000VBJEFK|4.0|Since this film was first released it's had nothing but rave reviews from most professional critics and Amazon critics alike. This is certainly a good film that has its entertaining moments and is quite memorable; however, it's nothing groundbreaking and certainly not a film that's worthy of 5 star status.<br />Remy is a sewer rat who's told by his family and friends that he must live off scraps of any food he can find. His family and friends can live this way without a problem, but Remy has a problem, he has an excelled sense of smell which means he can't bare to try the scraps that he's taught he must eat to survive. Remy, against the wishes of his Father, Remy endeavours to find new flavours by smelling and mixing different foods, but to do this he must enter the humans territory. He constantly enters the home of an elderly woman to borrow some flavourings, On his numerous trips there he reads a recipe book by a nationally famous French Chef, Gusteau. Gusteau inspires Remy to keep trying new mixtures of flavourings and ingredients. During one of his regular trips to the humans home, Remy brings his brother along and the woman wakes up to spot the rats rummaging through her cupboards. She brings out a gun and starts shooting at them both, which leads to her ceiling collapsing revealing hundred of rats who have been living in her attic. While all the rats are running, Remy is left behind and goes the wrong way down a sewer which leads him to Paris, right outside Gusteau's restaurant.<br />Gusteau's restaurant is in trouble as due to a recent negative review from a really tough critic the restaurant is bumped from 5 stars down to 3 which leads to the death of Gusteau. Remy finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's fixing a soup that was accidentally ruined by the Garbage Boy Linguini who's the nephew of Gusteau. The soup becomes a success and Linguini takes the credit as the minute Remy was spotted he was taken away by Linguini to prevent him being killed. They form an unlikely bond that leads them down a slippery slope filled with comedy, love and revenge.<br /><br />Now, like I said this film is a pretty good movie but it's nowhere nears the greatness that it's been described as by many critics. To be honest it's the typical Disney plot line sugar coated in a new story and new characters; to some this may be fine and you may still enjoy the whole \\"facing tragedy we all come together and make it work\\" story, but quite frankly I'm finding it dull. Unlike others I didn't buy this right away as I knew what to expect, I knew I would only get a new storyline, but before I'd even bought it I had worked out the ending. I love the Disney/Pixar films and I'm a big fan of The Incredibles, Cars and Monsters Inc. But this film, I just didn't see the magic that I felt from the three aforementioned movies.<br /><br />My little niece watched this film with me, and naturally she loved it, but I felt robbed. I know it's a kids movie, but I still expected to like this film as much as I did the other 3 Disney/Pixar movies especially considering how good some of the reviews were.<br />If you're thinking of buying this for a young relative then I would highly recommend it, but if you're looking for an innocent film that's going to recapture the magic of any previous Disney/Pixar collaborations than this is something that you should stay away fromikely bond that leads them down a slippery slope filled with comedy, love and revenge.

B000ZLFALI|1.0|I didn't know this was a freakin musical. And with slow lame Beatles covers to boot. Yuk! I didn't last more than a half hour which only took about ten mins because I FF'ed through all the musical numbers. I realize that thousands will love this stuff. Just not me. I'll take my Beatles by the Beatles.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is fantastic! There have been many comparisons between this and Pride and Prejudice -- and there are indeed many parallels -- however North and South is more gritty and raw then the refined P&P. I love Jane Austen and worship all her works, but I was captivated by this story. Richard Armitage plays a tempered, passionate John Thorton, whose outward cruelty towards his mill-workers softens as he begins to fall in love with the indomniable Margaret Hale, who is kind and gives her opinions as freely as her cares. Where Thorton is ruled by a strong sense of reason, Margaret is guided by her firm moral compass; both, like Darcy and Elizabeth, are proud and prejudiced. The viewer will be frustrated as every opportune moment for the characters to reveal their feelings are cut short by an interruption or a distraction -- be it Thorton's sister, the death of close family members or a mill-strike. Touching too, is the chemistry between the leads and the absolute ardent innocence of them -- Thorton's face softens and glows when he encounters Margaret; Margaret becomes coy and moved by Thorton. Set against a gritty class-struggle, industrial might, and the change of times (brilliantly metaphored by the Exhibition scene), North and South is perfect, in its portrayal of a deep romance between two very different -- but very good -- people as they overcome the impedances of assumption, spurned love, priorities, death, life, the pride of regionalism, and the prejudice of the heart, to fall into one of the greatest love stories ever told.     Outstanding preformances by all the leads, particularily the malicious but oddly-endearing Mrs. Thorton played by Sinead Cusack. I found this and bought it on a whim because I love the composer (Martin Phipps) and wanted to hear more of his music. The score absolutely elevates this film and I loathe that it has not been released. What a wonderful whim that I bought it! I highly recommend that anyone see this.    *****/***** for North and South.
0596007124|5.0|It's really wonderfull. Not only funny to read, the most important thing: you learn a lot with it.  If you know very much about patterns and object oriented design you may find it useless... but even then you'll admit it's a great book for beginners and for people (not only beginners) who's been working with Java (or other OOLanguage) but haven't learnt subtle details. It makes you realize how many things can be always done better. It takes enough time to explain everything well. And finally, it doesn't only teach patterns but a bit of OODesign in general.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|When I first watched this I chose to view the longer version - a review of segments from certain episodes featured in the TV show leading up to the beginning of this movie - that caught me up on some things that I had not yet seen and helped me understand where the story in the movie takes off from......<br /><br />I found it very entertaining, and a good story line, answered a lot of questions but still left the story open for continuing movies.  After 10 years of being on TV - the show has a good following and we all hope they keep on making these movies with the characters from the shows....<br /><br />I recommend this to all SG1 fans!
B000UZ4EP2|4.0|\\"Harry's Game\\" was my first exposure to Clannad, but not my last.  I've followed Moya Brennan's career from Clannad to her first solo CDs under the name Maire and now Moya, which is a more phonetic spelling of her Irish name.     \\"Signature\\" is a slightly different sound for Moya.  It's less layered atmospheric with a stronger pop rhythm than her earlier slower folk music works.  Vocals are still the signature chantlike beauty with an accompanying underpinning of Irish harp, bodhran, flutes, and uillean pipes. What I like better is the sound is engineered so the vocals are clearer and up-front of the orchestration.     If you're expecting Jimi Hendrix' rock standard from the opening title, \\"Purple Haze,\\" you'll be disappointed. Moya's \\"Purple Haze\\" is a strong opener that will conjure up images of the Irish landscape.     \\"Hear my Prayer\\" is a reflection of Moya's faith and a rededication:    Angels walk with me  Guard me to the waters edge  Wash away my doubts, my fear  Lord, strengthen me and bring me back to you    Fans of her Gaelic singing will be disappointed there's only one non-English song, \\"Pill a Run O\\". But do no not despair, this one very spare song with just Moya, light strings, and the Irish harp is possibly one of the most beautiful I've ever heard her sing.     \\"Signature\\" is a great introduction to Moya's sound if you're more a fan of pop than folk.  If like me, you've loved Moya since Clannad, it's still a good addition to your music collection, particularly if you want a mix that spotlights Moya's amazing, hauntingly beautiful voice.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie was fantastic...visually stunning and the parts were so well cast.  I had read the original STARDUST when it first came out some years ago, and didn't realize this was based on those comics/graphic novels until the movie was 10 minutes underway...what a pleasure to see a movie honor the original text and artist vision so well.  I highly recommend this charming movie to anyone...except for the very young, as there is some violence and scenes that could be frightening for those under 10 years of age.
B0010X73ZG|2.0|Horror and humor walk a very thin and blurry line, don't they?   There are so many unintentionally humorous moments in this film that it's hard to pick just one.   The acting is substandard, the people do stupid things, and the characters are one-dimensional.      The ending is also unsatisfying because it is not made clear that the military is wiping out the creatures and saving everyone everywhere, and we don't know just how far the mist spread.    It did get two things right:  1)  when civilization and technology are taken away, people go \\"Lord of the Flies\\" on each other--taking sides, choosing scapegoats, and letting fear get the best of them.  2)  the existential horror at the very end, when the man discovers that waiting a few more minutes could have saved several lives, is quite disturbing.
B000CC3SDW|5.0|If you are a Ennio Morricone's fan or not, you can't get wrong with this SACD. The performance of Yo Yo Ma is just wonderful and bring a new life, new ideas into Morricone's fine music ... You can compare the original scores and this performance, it is never the same or steril, it's a new point of view for all those magical moments, that comes up with Morricone's music. For example the legendary Ecstasy of gold - what a little miracle Ma made with this song. Marco Polo's Theme, Casualties of war, OUATIA, Cinema Paradiso and more & more. And the sound is just on hifi level. My collection of Morricone's scores on CD is over 100, but without this one it will be never the same again...

0783229364|5.0|This is one of my favorite 80's movies (amongist others). It has it all: great actors (Richard Jordan, Michael J. Fox, Margaret Whitton, Fred Gwynne and Helen Slater), comedy, romance, action, and a great soundtrack.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox plays Brantley Foster who lives on a farm with his parents in Kansas. Brantley looks to succeed and starts right at the top of the difficulty scale...Manhattan. You know the old saying, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. Same thing goes for teaching, within the suburbs they tell you to get expierence in the NYC schools first. But don't believe what you hear, it's definately not bad at all. Anyway, Brantley gets fired on the first day he reports to his job and follows that up with rejections when he applies for others. He then goes as a last resort to his Uncle Howard who is CEO of Pembroke. Brantley starts in the mailroom and cooks up a plan to reach as high as he can...so he can be able to fly back to his parents house in the corporate jet and be able to afford that lovely penthouse he has, just kidding. You have to see and \\"hear\\" his apartment for yourself. It's hillarious!<br /><br />Trouble arises: Enter Donald Davenport (Fred Gwynne) and a hostile company takeover. Brantley who goes by the name of Carlton Whitfield when he's a \\"suit\\" also finds the girl of his dreams in Christy (Helen Slater, who also is not related to Christian Slater FYI); a whiz kid on money matters. Brantley's boss in the mailroom is also suspecting something is up and have an evil eye on him. Carlton/Brantley also have to look out for Uncle Howard but his biggest challenge is to tame his Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton from Major League) who has taken a 'special liking\\" to him.<br /><br />All of this adds to tremendous laughs almost every minute. The ending at Uncle Howard's house is great fun and non-stop laughs along with that famous song (So beautiful--with the great sound effects) from Feris Bueller's Day Off (great movie also). The soundtrack includes Night Ranger's The Secret of My Success and Roger Daltrey's The Price of Love. If you like the music from the 80's, you'll like these songs as well as the soundtrack. It would be nice to have a DVD that has the soundtrack included. For example, the James Bond movies have the music video for that particular movie. Don't mind my minor knit-picking; this is a great movie and for anyone who enjoys comedies then this is a definate for your movie collection.<br /><br />To sum it up, can Carlton/Brantley outwit his Uncle Howard, tame the wild beast aka his Aunt, and make it to the top?Ranger's The Secret of My Success and Roger Daltrey's The Price of Love.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout has brought me closer to religion because I have faith that it works, and I thought the Lord was going to take me while I was try to complete level one. The moves are basic, so clumsy people like myself can perform them, but it is extremely challenging! There are three levels, so you can slowly work your way through each level. There is no cheesy music and the production is one that won't appear dated after a period of time. After just finishing level one, my arms feel like lead weights. I could barely stand raising them above my head when I took a shower after this workout. Usually, things that say lose \\"x\\" amount of weight in \\"x\\" amount of days leaves me feeling skeptical, but I have never felt this worked out after exercising, so I believe the claim will deliver. Obviously, Jillian knows her stuff as witnessed by the transformations she produces on The Biggest Loser.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|If you didn't like this movie, which it looks like a lot of people didn't, then I can pretty much guarantee that you probably liked Godzilla, ID4, Starship Troopers, War of the Worlds, Jackass, Superbad, Knocked Up and other MIND-NUMBINGLY stupid movies like those!!! Every character in Cloverfield represents someone YOU know...The hero who won't let the love of his life die alone, the best friend who copes by cracking jokes, the girl who is paralyzed with fear and her friend who doesn't want to be left alone (and ends up surviving)... Each of these characters do EXACTLY what REAL people would do when the most horrifying disaster we've ever seen starts to unfold.... Why does everything have to be explained to you people??? Oh, that's why, because you don't understand anything that isn't spelled out for you and force-fed down your throats... Everything is there on film even the hope filled ending... The tape WAS FOUND, WASN'T IT? The most honest, real, & emotional horror movie since 1979's Alien!!  AND Give it a rest with the way it was filmed with the camera all over the place.... yeah it was obnoxious for the first 15 minutes while you got used to it.  For a movie we have all seen a thousand times before, Cloverfield \\"roars\\" its way along side some of the greats!!!

B000X1R4S2|2.0|I write this review primarily to dispute the idea that this book is an epic. Time and again are people constantly labeling this book as an 'epic'. Rest assured folks, I am here to dispute that claim!<br /><br />I mean people, let's be reasonable! We cannot go around labeling books epics just because they are over a-thousand pages in length can we? Epics are stories which involve a bunch of people, places, and things. This story is mainly about nothing much more than seven kids battling with some creature out of a Star Trek episode--at most to save a small town! Not even a whole country or planet or course of history either. Most of all I, as a reader, get little out of it!<br /><br />Now [The Stand], that can be considered as more of an epic, as it involves a lot of characters and happenings--a plague hitting the earth and its consequences, which are mostly relatable.<br /><br />[It] however, is mostly unrelatable due to simple logic!--I've never in my life seen a statue of Paul Bunyon move; nor did I ever see a silly girl running hysterical in the streets because of blood coming out of her sink that nobody else can see. And really people, if no one else can see it, then just what is she so worried about anyway? Then there's the moving polariod snapshots--what's that all about? Home videos on photographs!!? Don't make me laugh! This is supposed to be 1958 not 2058!<br /><br />Now friends, I'm just as much a fan of Horror/Sci-Fi as the next guy, but I DO have my dignity to think about. Although most horror stories may be based on things we never really do see, a good one should have some sense of suspending ones disbelief or at least being so engaging that a few insults to intelligence would be forgivable.<br /><br />This novel does neither, as it is often much too silly and full of silly occurances. (Mummy floating over water?) Often it reads like a drunk depressed man bitching his woes over a typewriter wrote it more than it really reads like a professionally written novel. Example--toward the end  of the book when the town is collapsing: is it really so necessary for the narration of that whole occurance to occupy more than a couple pages?  (Rhetorical Question.) Then there's the business with Bill Denbourough's stuttering. Is a man really going to start stuttering again just because of some stupid phone call? And don't men stutter a bit more maturely than children? I sometimes had trouble even differentiating between the adult Bill Denburough (forgive my spelling, if incorrect)in contrast to the child one, because the dialogue written for the adult version was NO DIFFERENT in style. Nor did the characters in general behave much differently than their child selves as adults!<br /><br />At any rate, this novel still may be good for minor educational aspects, such as 1950's life in a small town, including the topic of racism. But, in truth, it reads much like a really long comic book that could've been more enjoyable if shorter.<br /><br />Yet, who knows? Perhaps my view of this book may change the day my kid brother is murdered by a clown in a sewer, or the decapitated head of a childhood acquaintance of mine appears inside of a refrigerator. Who knows... maybe then...<br /><br />--Rick Jonese book when the town is collapsing: is it really so necessary for the narration of that whole occurance to occupy more than a couple pages?

B000068FY0|5.0|Crime of the Century is probably the best album Supertramp ever made.  Starting here the songwriting became top notch and memorable, and the mysteriously quiet vibe the band had throughout most of the 70's is most noticeable on this album.    The title song truly amazes me every time I hear it.  It starts off quiet and eerie, like a detective snooping around through the rain in a dark city.  Then it surprises you by shifting gears and throwing in an atmospheric and VERY spooky piano melody.  The piano work builds into a jazzy jam while still maintaining the eerie vibe that really amazes me.  Wow, what a song.    \\"Bloody Well Right\\" is probably one of their most well-known songs (yes, even more popular than the hits from Breakfast in America).  I love the rocking verse melody and the poppy chorus.  \\"Dreamer\\" will probably sound familar from the popular TV commercial it's been appearing on lately.  Very good chorus, and a good way to figure out whether you'll like the lead singer or not (well, one of the two lead singers).    \\"School\\" has a brilliant jam in the middle that's catchy and melodic, and a good uplifting verse melody to make it a great song overall.  \\"Asylum\\" shows signs of the songwriting style Supertramp would continue with all through the 70's.    A great early album from a band that would soon become even bigger.
B000Y179KO|4.0|If you bought the CD then you're probably already an Eagles fan, so most reviewers will give this 4 or 5 stars.  But what you're going to find here is something that is a departure from anything they've ever done - and I liked it.  The second CD was a real bonus and I paid 15 Euros for the set and definitely got my money's worth.  The title song and a few others are exceptional, but what really carries this one is the way the music will carry you through an afternoon break on the couch.  Lyrics - top notch.  Arrangement of the tunes - excellent.  Price - worth it, but I wish it had been on iTunes.
B000000HTM|5.0|Pawn Hearts is considered Van Der Graaf Generator's masterpiece for a reason- it consists of three lengthy multi-part suites and each one of them maintains an interesting series of vocal melodies and lyrics.    Besides some saxophone parts here and there along with some drumming, this is mainly a progressive rock album for fans of vocal melodies and interesting lyrics (and some atmosphere too- in fact, a rather odd atmosphere that never makes you feel comfortable.  I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it feels like the Matrix or something).  The entire album gives off a vibe of bring trapped in a dream.    These are truly some of the best lyrics you will ever hear on a progressive rock album from the 70's, except for maybe Genesis (Peter Gabriel was really freakin' awesome).    My only complaint is that some of the rocking/speedy sections of their suites end up sounding cheesy.  It has something to do with the way the band tries to progress one of their suites from quiet and soothing to loud and heavy.  They weren't the best at it, that's for sure.  It's never a comfortable progression, it's always somewhat sloppy and awkward.  Not to mention some of the heavier parts sound like the cheesier moments of a band like Kiss or someone similar.  Maybe the singer just isn't a good screamer, I don't know.      Despite that, I love the music anyway and really, you only need one Van Der Graaf Generator album in your collection because all of them sound exactly the same, so it mine as well be this one.

B00005A0V0|5.0|This is supposed to be the ultimate Caravan album, but you know, the previous one \\"If I Could...\\" is probably *slightly* better.  Probably because this album has some weak songwriting moments such as the pleasant, but ultimately passable title song.  Yes, I realize most people love it, and you probably will to.      For me though, the highlight is clearly the 20+ minute jam that appears at the very end.  It's truly mind-boggling awesome.  Yes, we've ALL heard how adventurous music can be, but my goodness, THAT is a jam guaranteed to take your brain places!  There's also a few scattered vocal melodies and just some good atmosphere in there as well.  The jam consists mainly of that instrument that sounds like a keyboard but most people say it's a guitar so, whatever that thing is, it sounds VERY cool.    I find it cool I'm about to submit a review for an old and somewhat forgotten progressive rock album from the 70's only HOURS after someone else posted a review of their own, haha.

B00005NKKY|5.0|Whilst the duo's previous masterwork (1966's Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme) showcased both Paul Simon's supremely literary lyricism and Art Garfunkel's gorgeously elegiac vocals at the height of their powers, 1968's Bookends transcends its predecessor in terms of its understated ambition.<br /><br />Whilst it is possible to view Bookends as something of a parody of all that S&G and their contemporaries were (rightly or wrongly) associated with (be it folk rock, 60s counter-culture, the ever-widening disparity between age and youth), the wryness of many of the its tracks belies the top-to-bottom subversive nature of a record conventionally viewed as one of transition.<br /><br />Traditional production values and classic song structure in particular are each flagrantly disavowed by Simon's lithe song writing and Garfunkel's atypical vocal arrangements - most notably Simon's almost zeugmatic lyrical stream on `Save the Life of My Child' or Garfunkel's beautiful interlude on `Overs' - on the album where each of the duo's customary roles are least apparently delineated, rendering Bookends their most diplomatic work.<br /><br />Themes of age and existence pervade the record with many tracks calling into question many sacrosanct inter-/intra-generational ideals yet refusing to divulge any definitive answers. Indeed it is the tracks that most apparently partake this ambiguous stance - `America', `Old Friends', `Bookends', `A Hazy Shade of Winter' and perhaps the duo's most famous work, `Mrs Robinson' - that have become amongst the most beloved in S&G's canon.<br /><br />For much of it's overt seriousness and underlying caveat however, there is still an infectious sense of exuberance to Bookends with some memorably ornate touches here and there (`Fakin' It' and `Punky's Dilemma' in particular) - and it would take a heart of stone not to raise a smile at Garfunkel's outrageous falsetto-counter to Simon's vocal on the line \\"'he must be high on something,' someone said!\\" during `Save the Life of My Child'.

B0011U8NZ2|4.0|This is perhaps the best starting point for The Doors' Bright Midnight Archives releases as it's affordable compared to the rest of the catalog and you are getting very good (arguably the best) renditions of many songs in the live vein from these tours.    Back Door Man, Love Hides and Five to One are no strangers to the set list with BMA releases and these are good renditions.     Moving along to Roadhouse Blues - it rocks, Morrison reprises his \\"scat\\" vocal  with great enthusiasm; the best live rendition I've heard.     Moving on to the Mystery Train, Away in India and Crossroads Blues jam; Ray plays with an energy on these that is not entirely unheard before, but just a little bit more \\"on.\\" Or perhaps it's just he's louder in the mix. Ray's keyboards are upfront on this release; his bass runs are at equal volume with his other keyboard parts and this is unique. We are talking subtleties here, you can here the whole band, but you can really hear Ray leading the band on this one.    Universal Mind and Someday Soon are ok songs (Someday Soon being particular to this release) and I'll leave it at that.    Now we get to the interesting part of the release. When the Music's Over features some guttural shouts, screams and feedback loops that lead to the very awesome Soft Parade Vamp. This is the \\"... callin' on the dogs ... you gotta' meet me ... at the crossroads ...\\" part of the song which is distinctly different from the recorded version. It rocks and makes one wish there were more live renditions of The Soft Parade out there to hear.     Light My Fire, well the first 1:44 of the song is from Live in Philadelphia patched on to the Pittsburgh version. You can see Bruce Botnick's liner notes for the explanation, it's barely noticeable.      Another excellent entry for the Bright Midnight Archives, check it out if you are a die hard Doors' fan.
0553296981|4.0|A classic that we all should read when we are young, and again when we are older. It emphasizes the fact that evil does exist in our world, and that evil often comes from a government. It belongs in all of our libraries.

B0012GVKVY|5.0|First than anything, I am reviewing the movie as a Blu-Ray and not as a movie itself.  The movie is all right...Will Smith is a great actor. However, the Blu-Ray version of this particular movie makes it a must have for any Blu-ray player owner. The reason Why I believe it's so great is because for the following reasons:  1. Vizio VW42L 42 HDTV (1080i) (less than $1000)  2. Playstation 3  3. Home Theater Sony HT-DDW790 ($150.00)  If I have cheap equipment, and I still get to experience such a great High definition experience, then it must really means that the Disc itself is awesome!!!   This movie is worth paying more than $30, trust me!
B000002KOO|5.0|A beatiful record despite the sound quality (cd). After more than 250 plays (both vinyl and cd)it´s still is a magical album. Where is the re-mastered version?
B00136NXCC|5.0|I like the weirdest artists, but most often I like people who, regardless of ability or whatever, transcend themselves to make a good pop song. And that means Billie Holiday (who made bad songs into good ones) and glam rockers and whatever. And Britney holds her own, I think. You'll see.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw this sleeper hit movie and the music haunts you until you get the music on CD and then all is right with the world....just wonderful music.
B000UW8596|4.0|Evil.  Pure evil.<br />This movie has every intention of figuratively bending your mind over and pounding repulsive images deep into your psyche.  Round after round of shocking, horrid, repulsive, disheartnening violence.  Brutally explicit raping and torturing of young teens.  The horror depicted in this film is way too gruesome and real for most people to even fathom.<br />This is also an abhorrent display of power along with the depravity.  Aristocratic leaders collect the youth and totally corrupt them--both physically, mentally, and sexually.  It's a prison camp of torture and molestation.  And it's all shown in explicit fashion.  Seriously, it's so graphic you'll be begging for a break in the abuse.  An extremely hard film to watch.<br /><br />All the hype you've heard about this movie is true.  This version is much cheaper than the Criterion, but the shots are somewhat grainy and probably need some restoring.  Not that you'll want a better view.  Even if you're a certified gore hound, this film will have you tucking your tail between your legs and whimpering for salvation.  Proceed with the utmost caution.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|We thought they had lost the plot a bit at the end of the second season, but were pleasently surprised by Season Three. It definitely got better again and we are really into watching this one. Can't wait for Season Four to come out on DVD.
0375424474|3.0|This could have been a fascinatingly informative book if it stuck to the finding of the fossil itself and its unique mosaic of features, like the present-day platypus and its mosaic of features. What kills this book's getting a better rating is that it is yet one more Nova/Nat'l Geographic type sermon praising the theory of evolution. \\"This means that and thus it is so\\" mentality that so many evolutionists pummel us with ruins the best impact of fossil data in letting it speak for itself. Tiktaalik roseae doesn't scream evolution nor does it dance the transitional fossil hype shuffle. It just is one heck of a unique critter that lived a LONNNNNGGGGGGG time ago before man walked the earth. Because it is a mosaic lifeform of features evolutionist went looking for with a paradigm in tow doesn't make it what they say it appears to be. In the final analysis -- it is a weird critter and no more. What Tiktaalik roseae definitely \\"gave rise to\\" was yet another evolutionist \\"happy dance\\" and no more. Wow! What a glorious diversity of life this planet has held & still offers! (researcher at Duke University)
B0002BO0HG|5.0|The depth Antony conveys in this CD via tone, vibrato, vulnerability and lyrics and/or whatever intangibles that are simply his soul coming through is simply breathtaking!
055358894X|5.0|I should preface this by saying that I love con-man stories, and heist stories and the like. Harry Harrison's \\"Slippery Jim\\" DiGriz and Spider Robinson's \\"Professor\\" are two of my favorite characters in SF. On the fantasy side the list, I will very happily add Locke Lamora.     This book is simply great fun. Don't look for deep soul searching or life-changing hipster-pretentious prose. What the book has is a fascinating world, and incredibly fun and audacious characters. It has its tragedies and heavy moments, but they're neither overly melodramatic or jarring to the plot.  Locke's plans, if looked at objectively, might be a bit far-fetched, but the book pulls you along and draws you in so well that you won't mind straining your suspension-of-disbelief muscles a bit.

0307237699|4.0|Barack Obama, what a name, so many are scared of just that, his name.  Sad, I think.  This book was well written and left me with a feeling that Obama could possible truly understand what is happening in our Country.  Still not convinced that he knows how to fix the problems, but knowing the issues is better than most.  Great book and great opportunity to look into the beliefs of this presidential candidate.
0452289963|5.0|Excellently written book by Eckhardt Tolle.  He does a great job of making you more aware and also cognizant of how the ego operates in our lives to keep us down and only by being present in everything that we do, can we kick the ego aside and make our lives richer and more meaningful.  I found so very many \\"Aha\\" moments as Oprah would say!  Anyone reading this book would benefit if they are open and objective.
B00133MKVK|5.0|As I write this, Dame Shirley is at no. 3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play and deserves to reach the top coveted spot with the amazing title track.

1401211909|2.0|Again, I must apologize for my Gaiman-antipathy.  I know in part it's personal, and I encourage you to look beyond that.  The simple fact of the matter is that Neil Gaiman and I are *never* on the same page, no matter what book I have open.<br /><br />_Stardust_ is okay.  It's a quick yarn, got some cute references to fairy tales, and the occasional decent pun.  But there's nothing remarkable upon it.  No actually interesting characters or situations or turns of phrase.  It's forgettable.

It is life altering for those who get it, and for those who do not-put it away for awhile and come back to it in the future , it will all make sense to you when you are ready for it. If everyone could put this in to practice, the world would change and wars, hatred, and everything else that separates us from peace would vanish.
0375424474|5.0|What a pity there is no Nobel for palaeontology.  Some sort of award should be given to Neil Shubin for finding \\"Tiktaalik\\" in the Canadian Arctic.  It wasn't a chance find - he relates the detailed planning steps leading to its discovery.  An extra ribbon should grace the medal for explaining that fossil's significance in this book.  There have been recent accounts  on the evolutionary path of animals emerging from the sea to take up the role of landlubber.  Carl Zimmer's \\"At The Water's Edge\\" and Jenny Clack's \\"Gaining Ground\\" are examples.  Both preceded the \\"Tiktaalik\\" find, but more to the point here is that while both are excellent writers, Shubin demonstrates communicative skills bordering on the superb.  This is truly a book for everybody.  Especially if you want to know why you develop hiccups.<br /><br />A great fuss was made over the \\"Tiktaalik\\" discovery.  What is its significance?  For starters, it was flat-headed [\\"So what?  I know lots of people who are flat . . .\\"].  While we may consider flat heads in derogatory terms, for life emerging from the sea, it was a vital step.  That the head could move independent of the rest of the body was even more significant.  Fish cannot do this, and except for bottom dwellers, don't have flat heads.  Further, \\"Tiktaalik's\\" eye structure gave it forward vision.  In a creature 375 million years old, these characteristics are significant.  They offer clues to how you and I are put together and why.  Shubin offers a meaningful example of this when he showed \\"Tiktaalik\\" to his daughter's preschool class and they declared it to be both fish and reptile - which is the key to the value of his work here.<br /><br />Land dwelling, Shubin reminds us, requires major changes in body plan.  Instead of fins propelling the body through the water, limbs capable of supporting that body must develop.  Those limbs must have flexible contact points, leading to the formation of fingers from fin bones.  Lifting the body reformed the bones' arrangement leading to our wrist and hand structures.  Air breathing shifts the location of oxygen-capturing equipment and distribution.  Predation techniques change, which might render some bones superfluous.  The author's description of how the former jaw bones of fish relocated over time to become the delicate transmitters of sound in our inner ears.  Making sound turns out to be derived from other fish.  The ancestors of sharks left a string of arches as part of our bodybuilding mechanisms.  One of those arches nestles in your throat as the hyoid bone, essential in making speech.  Another of those arches evolved into the diaphragm separating our lungs from other internal organs.  Hiccuping, Shubin says, \\"has its roots in fish and tadpoles\\" because the pattern set in our brain that controls breathing has been \\"jury-rigged\\" in the steps to becoming human.  In fish, the distance from the brain to the gills is short, but in mammals, the convoluted path those nerves take allows for signal disruptions - hence, hiccups.<br /><br />Shubin spends much time explaining the development of embryo studies.  Watching the progress of a fertilised egg in becoming a finished organism gave researchers insight in how to look for signs of how today's life is assembled.  In Freshman Biology, we are still told of \\"ontology recapitulates phylogeny\\" - the idea that a human embryo goes through fish, reptile and mammal stages during development.  Karl von Baer had already discovered this was incorrect, but it took modern genetic analysis to overturn Ernst Haekel's enduring axiom. Embryos, von Baer observed, form in triple layers, and depending on the signals from the genome, enable one of the layers to begin dominating to produce the appropriate body plan.  Shubin uses these studies to further explain the rise in understanding leading to the appropriate HOX genes triggering the chosen layer.  As he notes, his work area is braced by two seemingly irrelevant facilities - a fossil preparation facility at one side, and a genetics laboratory at the other.  This book brings the two disciplines together with seamless effectiveness.  Graced with some photographs, but many fine line drawings to enhance the text, the book is a prize addition to everybody's library.

B000MX7V5M|5.0|Very fine copy of an all time classic.  The lead actors are stunning and the writing is outstanding.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I don't like musicals. I think most are incredibly cheesey, so I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. I'm also a huge Beatles fan, so I had high hopes. The first time I watched it, I was extremely critical, picking out every flaw I saw. But after watching it, I found myself wanting to watch the performance pieces again. Jim Sturgess (Jude) has a beautiful voice and sounds natural singing Beatle songs. One of my favorite cover's was of Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite! It's all improv. I've watched Across the Universe again and again, and found something unique and interesting everytime I watch it. The imagery is spectacular and all songs are redone in good taste. Really a beautiful movie.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Start anywhere. I like \\"The Wolf\\" as a starting track. It sets the mood of \\"Into the Wild\\" perfectly - foreboding, yet expansive. All the tracks on this soundtrack set a mood, usually contemplative (Society), sometimes resigned (End of the Road), occasionally joyful and brash (Setting Forth) and always philosophical without being preachy (Hard Sun). Some here have complained that the songs are \\"too short\\" or that there is other music in the film that is not represented here. Since when did the length of a song determine its impact? Since when was there a law that says all music in a film must appear in a soundtrack CD? This CD is only the music Eddie created and played (all instruments - like back in the good old days with Stevie Wonder's Innervisions - which this CD somehow seems to vibe with pretty well), and as such it is a wonderfully cohesive whole.<br /><br />\\"Guaranteed\\" perfectly captures the life of Chris McCandless... \\"Don't come closer or I'll have to go\\"... \\"Got my indignation but I'm pure in all my thoughts... I'm alive...\\" Eddie nailed it. Yes, I read the book years ago when it was published. I saw the movie, but I didn't expect to be so moved by the soundtrack. Not only does this music sound and feel great on the CD, it was perfectly woven through the movie. I'm no fan of Sean Penn, but his talent is unmistakable. Tapping Eddie for this music was a stroke of genius. As for no Oscar nominations... well, the Academy of Self Indulgent Paid Off Sold Out So Called Experts lost my respect decades ago.
B00132D808|2.0|I was so excited to buy this cd. I have been waiting for MONTHS!!! So I buy this cd expecting the cool techno sound and i was surprised to find that this album turned into a beatles wannabe cliche album. If i wanted to listen to the beatle sound, i would BUY the beatles cd. I wanted to buy a techno/rock  album and i was thoroughly disappointed. The only good songs are nine in the afternnon and that green gentleman. The rest is boring. I want a refund....Also, the lead guitarist and lyricist (Ryan ross) desperately wanted to sing in this album, and he totally sucks. Brendon's voice gives Panic its unique sound. This CD is just disappointing. If you REALLY want it, just burn it. I dont recommend buying it. They definitely dont deserve money for creating this. This is reminiscent of the killer's disastrous album sam's town. Once they abandon their old sound, they ruin it for the fans.
0441003257|3.0|I just finished reading this and I have to say I'm surprised how many reviewers here say they've never laughed so much. Maybe they enjoyed a few pints while they read it. While I found it funny, I never broke out into laughter.    Overall I'd say this was funny and intriguing enough that you'll be glad you read it, but you may find, like I did, that the climax & ending is a bit of a disappointment.
0767020308|1.0|I thought this version was awful compared to the theatrical one with Paltrow. Beckinsale was so bland and I thought the acting seemed forced throughout. Knightly's character lacked any charm, which made me wonder why any woman would fall for him. The version piled on the foreshadowing so that you didn't even need to guess what was going on between the characters and this aspect particularly disappointed me and did not seem true to Austen.
B001152TL6|3.0|i love this movie.  i had no problem following it when i first saw it in the  theater and still love it today.  i am extremely bummed out by the fact that the features that were to accompany this disc were omitted.  the multi angle featurette with lynch is clearly not here. i haven't checked out the transfer quality yet but my guess is that it is a high compression transfer, around 5 gb or so.  buy it for the movie if you don't have a region 2 player .  if you do, buy the german release.
B00132D808|5.0|Almost all of my friends LOVE My Chemical Romance, Dashboard Confessional, Mindless Self-Indulgence, etc. But I never liked their music (not the \\"emo\\" type).   My sister had bought I Write Sins Not Tragedies when it came out...too much like all the other bands my friends listened too.    I wasn't too excited about Panics new CD, but when my best friend made me listen to it, I was just like \\"WHOA! I love this!\\"  It's different, and its a GREAT thing! Lately artists are heading back to what was good about music in the past. Even Christina Aguilara converted her bad girl image for a more jazz inspired attitude.   This new CD reminds me a bit of The Shins, The Beatles, everything good.  I can't stop listening to it. I usually don't ever buy CD's, but right now I just want to go out to the store and buy Pretty Odd.   It is seriously has the best lyrics, catchy rhythms and harmony's, AAAHHH! I just love it!  If you love oldies (a guilty pleasure for EVERYONE), then this CD is seriously a must for the new and old generation.

0374280967|4.0|This short and sweet novella is many things:  humorous, witty, insightful, linguistic, intelligent, and even mysterious.  We follow Queen Elizabeth II of England as she discovers a love for reading late in life; her thirst for books is one many a bibliophile can relate to.  Those of us who have friends and relatives who occasionally insist that we need to set aside books to \\"interact\\" or \\"try something else\\" will recognize a kindred spirit in Her Majesty as the queen hides books nearby in order to snatch a few blessed words when she can.<br /><br />Alan Bennett's delightful novella has many phrases that will have you nodding in agreement, and his rather sly way with words will have you smiling.  While I was not quite as enamored of the ending as some, I did find this book to be a wonderful read and can highly recommend it.  All voracious readers will doubtless devour it in one sitting and then return to its pages for further insight later.

B00111L0MY|5.0|This film will literally knock you over.  Controversial police proceedure aside, this film focuses on a private detective who beats the streets of boston with his whip-smart girlfriend.  The two of them were hired to find a missing girl whose mother is a deadbeat drug addict.  How is this a good movie?  Ignore some of the technical flaws in this film, what it captures is a moral controversy between what is morally correct and what is correct in the eyes of the law.  This is really tough stuff and it will keep you debating long after the film.  Actually, when a decision is made towards the end, you might go back and change your mind after watching the final scene.  How flawed is our system?  Why is it that we license dog owners but not parents?  What constitutes neglect?      There is one more star to this movie which is not credited...the city of Boston.  Affleck, being a Bostonian, went to great lengths to secure authenticity in his film.  He captures the blue collar personas which make this city so great.  This film actually rivals \\"the Departed\\" and \\"Mystic River\\" in the portrayl of this town.  All in all it is a very promising start for Ben.  I hope that he can bring the same love and dedication to future films or even to films that don't take place in his home town.
0679809015|4.0|I purchased this book for my 18 month old son. He loves to open the special doors. Open the barn door is a sweet book and stands up to my son's not so gentle approach to reading. The doors are a little tough to open for him alone as they stick. But it holds up quite well.
B0010X745K|3.0|Am a big fan of the story, which I read years ago.  So waiting for the movie to come out on DvD, the day that it did I ran out and picked it up.  Great movie, all the way up until the end.  Then the director really screwed it up, at least in my humble opinion.  There was so many ways for this movie to end, hell leave it the way King did.  This is a movie that I will probably not watch again, just because of that.  (SPOILER ALERT) It just wasn't the way they did it, but it was so out of character.  I mean, they survive and fight, then bam thats it, were done.

This band takes a good song base and destroys it everytime with either a la,la la la or a change that just doesn't go anywhere.  I don't doubt they can play their instruments, I just think that perhaps they should change places and try again.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|I was excited at the prospect of a Doctor Who spin off but this show far exceeded my high hopes. I was hooked from the very first episode. Torchwood is a slick, smart, more adult show. The flawless casting enhances every excellent script with emotion and reality (even in the face of the unreal) getting the viewer involved with each individual story and more especially the lives and interactions of the Torchwood members. The characters grow with each episode and their chemistry pops off the screen.    I recommend this show even to people who claim they don't like sci-fi because this show is so much more. It's simply amazing entertainment.    For those of you who aren't up on the current season of Torchwood (season 2) just let me say OMG! This show just keeps getting better.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you really want to experience Blu Ray in all its glory, nothing is better than Planet Earth on Blu Ray. I have the DVD version and I CAN tell the difference. Get this version if you have the Blu Ray capabilities. In fact, get this first if you get a Blu Ray player.
0375507256|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  It is a very complex book, which simply adds to its charm, since I didn't have any trouble following the storyline and interconnections that make up the novel.  It is like a puzzle - you have to get well into the book to even slightly understand where it's going.  But the manner in which it keeps you guessing I found absolutely intriguing.  It has a very poignant, uplifting ending as well.  Highly recommend it.
B0016LTNL4|5.0|Death at a Funeral is quintessential British humor. There are a lot of characters, but each is so different from the others that there is no confusion about identity. The basic premise is a staid, English manor house funeral with the requisite widow, two slightly estranged brothers, and a bevy of friends and family coming to pay their last respects to the recently deceased (and highly respectable)lord of the manor. You begin to see the film's evolution from the moment the funeral home delivers the wrong casket to the manor house! My husband and I both enjoyed this movie very much. There is something here for most ages although it is not suitable for children under 13 and some of the humor might be subtle enough to escape some older teens as well. There is some language and a bit of nudity but nothing highly offensive. Just very funny.[[ASIN:B0011KQSZ4 Death at a Funeral]]
0810994739|5.0|any book i can buy to excite my children to read i'm all for it. I had bought part 1 of this book & my son read it in 3 hours. I went online to see if there was anymore in the series & found part 2. It was not in the stores (I wanted to get it fast for my son to read). I did not get it over night but i did get it before my son came over for the weekend. I let him open up the package. He loved it. I saw him reading it right away. He read the book so fast that the next time i saw him his finger was in the book. I asked him how he is liking the book? He told me he liked it so much that he is already reading it again. WOW!! By the way he just turned 11 & the pages are over 200. Not too bad I thought.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|The film of \\"The Mist\\" is a solid, very well made, character driven horror film. However, as a color film, it resonates solely as a newly made great b movie. In the black and white version, located on disc 2, the film is absolutely stunning. Stunning in its imagery, which literally pops out in black and white, and stunning in its implications. What adapter/director, Frank Darabont has done here is completely transform his film from a drive in (type of) film, to a piece of art that contrasts dark shadows with the light showing through the Mist. In color, the people in the supermarket come across as regular people that one needs to look through their fascades to see the real people underneath. Though in black and white, within these two colors, within these two extremes, one can not help but watch as the two camps in the supermarket form in not only a highly literal, but also a theatrical way. It's clear in black and white that these characters are not just people, but archtypes for the human condition and in my opinion, the film benefits immensely from not only seeing the horror in black and white, but also feeling the horror, sometimes as bleak as possible.<br />The ending reminded me of other powerful films, like \\"The Rapture.\\"<br />The two disc dvd version is the only way to go with this release. All the featurettes are of quality, the commentary is informative and one gets both versions of this highly entertaining and enthralling film.

184195425X|4.0|My initial reaction after finishing was that this was a good story.    After thinking about it a bit further, the ending seemed to spoil the book.  And that's what I was going to write when I sat down at my computer; however, after half-writing this review, I found myself thinking that the book might have been good after all.    I have serious problems with Martel's line of thinking, but he really delivers in giving us food for thought, and I've now thought more about the themes in this book than I have of some of the recent literature I've read.    Martel really executes this book to perfection, if you consider his message.  I believe the reason why there are negative reviews of this book is that those are people who have read it as a story, rather than as a work of literature.    This book is better considered as an expression of a thematic idea, rather than as a story.  In that sense the book is successful, even if it is not exactly persuasive.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I heard this at a local book/music store two days in a row, and by the 2nd day, I was intrigued.  Bought the cd, shared it with a few people, and have generally really enjoyed it.  Style seems to be a mix of Modest Mouse, The Pixies and David Bowie.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Once again, it is truly amazing how 43 extra footage can change your perception of a story. And, it is truly unfortunate that directors are inclined (read: forced) to edit films to appeal to a 'broader' audience. 'The Lord of The Rings : The Two Towers Extended Edition' is a much more complete and meaty version of the film and easily makes the theatrical version obsolete.     I've read the books (about 3 times), and I was one of those 'purists' who was a little frustrated with all of the edits and changes Peter Jackson and co. made to Tolkien's works. Eventually I came around and realized that its not easy translating a massive epic into three two and a half hour long films and I enjoyed the theatrical versions for what they were; an amazing epic fantasy drama of the highest order. Then the Extended Editions came out...    'The Two Towers' Extended Edition features 43 minutes of extra film footage, and once you have watched it you will never understand why these extra 43 minutes were shaved from the film. It may not seem like much in the grand scheme of things (especially when the theatrical cut was almost 3 hours long), but 43 minutes adds so much more to the film. Characters on both sides of this story are properly fleshed out and given more depth, and I cannot stress how important this 43 minutes of extra footage is to the overall story. I've always had an issue with the theatrical 'abridged' version, so the Extended Edition is a breath of fresh air.    For fans of the trilogy, fantasy buffs and movie lovers...
0446401307|5.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly's novels and do believe I've read all the Harry Bosch thrillers.  The phone rings at midnight.  Harry is awake.  He's waiting.  I like way Connelly puts us on the case immediately.  Not a lot of messing around.  The writing is bare bones, spare, with no unnecessary scenery or dialog.  As a reader I get the feeling that Connelly knows the ins and outs of the LAPD.  He's got the Police Procedural down.  He's the best at that, but what I really love is the writer's characterization.<br /><br />When a murder comes in with any sort of political, celebrity or media attachment, a case that is particularly time consuming and threatens to stay active like a hobby, the precinct will take it initially, but it will be soon shuttled over to Homicide Special. This is Harry's first call out since his transfer from Cold Cases to his new outfit, Homicide Special.  This one is anything but routine, and contains a threat to National Security and so has attracted the FBI, and who should be the agent but his old flame, Rachel Walling (Echo Park) who tries to take over his case.  Is Bosch going to let that happen?  What do you think?<br /><br />\\"The Overlook\\" while more compact than other Connelly novels, still has that Harry Bosch, nothing-but-the-truth attitude, that don't-bother-me-with-that-supervision crap, that we love from our guy.  Harry Bosch is a relentless bulldog, and even though we are screaming at the page, \\"No, Harry, play by the rules this time!\\"  Harry will always be Harry.  Meet his new partner/mentee Ignacio Ferras who tries in vain to keep the 30-year veteran of the department from recklessly taking them both down.  By now, with a dozen Harry Bosch novels under my belt, I realize that my boy is going to pull it off.  Somehow.<br /><br />\\"The Overlook\\" has all the direction/misdirection, the red herrings, all the elements needed to keep us guessing.  This one is particular good on that count, so when Harry's at the scene and gets that instinctual feeling that he's missing something, you better believe that what he has missed, he will eventually be figured out, and it'll come back later and clear itself up.<br /><br />A great read.  Highly recommended.t he's missing something, you better believe that what he has missed, he will eventually be figured out, and it'll come back later and clear itself up.    A great read.  Highly recommended.
0143039504|5.0|This is an excellent book of Jane Austin's novels. The editor has done a fine job of discussing the novels as well as the person of Austin. The book itself is sturdy even though a paperback. If you are an Austin fan for the stories themselves, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a valuable copy of any of her novels, this is not the book for you.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|For the Evanescence fans from their CD \\"Fallen\\" you'll only be slightly dissapointed. I could listen to every song on \\"Fallen\\" but there is only a few where I don't really want to hear. Overall it's a nice cd.
0553382179|5.0|This book is very helpful if  you deal with any kind of clutter in your life, and you dont know where to start.   It teaches you to approach clutter in your home 15 minutes at a time.  Baby steps is the key.  You didnt make the mess in a day, and its going to take longer than that to get the clutter out of your life.  Key here is to jump in and start someplace.  Love this book :)
B0010V4TZU|5.0|Not crazy about many contemporary bands, I heard one song of VW on radio & chased it down. It's one of my favorites....bright, melodic, rhythmic. It's hard to sit still listening to it.I can hear the lyrics, but I don't understand them & I don't care. I've bought extra albums for friends & every one has said, \\"I adore this!\\"even though they have no clue about the NY references. I would advise the band not to label itself (self-described as \\"Upper West Side Soweto\\") because that will limit it in people's minds.
B00026WUBE|4.0|Don't be put off by the awful cover art - \\"Planet Waves\\" (1974) is a must for Dylan admirers. It contains some of his greatest, most heartfelt music - \\"Forever Young\\" (slow version) and \\"Dirge\\" are classics. Dylan was is in good form around this time and would follow this up one year later with the brilliant \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" (1975).
0141439661|4.0|Two sisters have come of marrying age.  One loves rashly and deeply, the other cautiously and with no little reserve - the sense and the sensibility.  The contrast set up, Jane Austen takes the two young women through nearly the same set of events.  Through love's introduction, intervening conflict and ultimate disappointment, we observe the impacts and the results of these two disparate manners of dealing with the opposite sex.  This being a Jane Austen comedy, don't be surprised if things work out for someone in the end.<br /><br />While obviously very well written and full of interesting characters and insights, this, like most of Jane Austen's work, simply \\"doesn't do it for me.\\"  Certainly Ms. Austen is not without her modern relevance, but many of the important ideas running through her novels, including this one, are foreign and even offensive.  For example, her casual indifference toward the unmoneyed, her obvious belief in the natural limitations of the female sex and the importance she sets on formality set my teeth a-grinding.  She writes, as they say, of a different time.  Similarly, her writing style is often, including in this book, tedious and opaque.  Economy of words and clarity are not so important as obeisance to formality and avoidance of perceived impropriety.  As I said, writing of a different time.  As one can likely see, my complaints about Jane Austen are more due to my own predilections than any shortcomings of the famed authoress.<br /><br />That said, I do believe that reading this book is good for a person - it will make you more informed and provide material worth thinking on.  Several of the characters will stick with you.  Ms. Austen has a way of making her characters very distinct despite the smallness of her authorial world.  The characters are not Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but the Dashwood girls are worth remembering.  Furthermore, the major themes, while not \\"big ideas\\" are relevant to most everyone and persuasivelyresolved.  Sense and sensibility was for me, however, less enjoyable reading than I would prefer.  The plot line moved slowly, the ideas seemed dated and the language obscured rather than revealed.
1401216676|3.0|This is a review for the deluxe version of The Killing Joke released on March 19th 2008, not the differently colored version originally released in 1988 that went on to be a sequential art classic.    It's nice to see The Killing Joke in hardcover and in a bigger page format.  The crisp line work of Brian Bolland shines even more on a wider, longer page.  His legendary hatching and feathering technique deserves the industry version of \\"widescreen\\".  This is where my compliments on this edition mainly lie.  The recoloring brings out a very different response in me.     The recoloring by penciller Brian Bolland for this edition was a mistake.  Gone are the atmospheric tints and lighting effects from John Higgins.  Gone are great effects like raindrops on The Joker's shoulder when he appears in the story for the first time.  Gone is an important component of the story that stood along Moore's script and Bolland's fine penciling as something that made The Killing Joke a visual tale to be remembered by Batman and comic book fans alike.     Bolland's recoloring job for the most part looks like he turned white lights onto every scene set in the story's present narrative and therefore effectively kills the disturbing mood that Higgins colors had substantially helped inject into the story.  Instead of the original presence of emotion and horror, this version takes on some visual blandness.  The scene between Alfred and Batman in the Batcave loses its somber tone.  The attack on Barbara Gordon loses some of the terror of the original.  Where has the strong mood of this story gone DC?  I can see adjusting the intensity of Higgins original color palette to some degree like the method they chose with his coloring when they released an Absolute Version of Watchmen.  It sophisticated his coloring job without changing the tone of the original.  Production services at DC Comics should have just ignored Bolland's plea to recolor it altogether and let John Higgins go back and tweak his original job.  I could even see Bolland and Higgins collaborating on a new recoloring but not Bolland by himself.    The flashbacks in the \\"possible\\" Joker origin have been changed to black and white with emphasis certain objects that are colored.  This seems to work in a foreshadowing sense and it is disquieting to see what is chosen to be labled crimson.  However, the flashback's black and white could have used more grays or a darker tint overall on these sequences (with the exception of the red objects).  The Killing Joke is a very dark tale and a nice retro feel should not take the place of overall atmospheric disposition.  If it was originally done as a play or film a good lighting designer or cinematographer would acknowledge the original intention through the lighting methods, but not dilute the story being told.     I loved the back up 8-pager, \\"An Innocent Man\\" when originally printed as a black and white tale for the 1996 Batman: Black and White anthology.  However, I don't believe stories originally intended to be printed in black and white should get colored reprintings and vice versa.  The only reason it seems to be included it because it is another Batman story by the same artist as The Killing Joke.  I would much rather have seen more Joker sketches and covers that Bolland has done for fanzines, conventions, commisons and DC over the years--after all this book is supposed to focus on the Joker.      Alan Moore would not have approved of reprinting any script excerpts but that hasn't stopped DC Comics from going against his wishes as they have in the past.  Fans would have loved reading the original script--even just one or two pages!  This collection is aimed at fans of the Killing Joke.  Give them a decent amount of extras DC!   I realize that most of the original penciled and inked pages from the Killing Joke are hard to track down. Still, DC has plenty of Joker covers and art from Bolland that could have filled out the extras section very nicely.Batman: Year One, Dark Knight Returns, Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth have all had satisfying deluxe reprintings but it seems Killing Joke, a story that is certainly in the same league as those others, has gotten inferior anniversary treatment.    Before buying this edition, one should seek out examples online of side-by-side comparisons of pages from the original and recolored editions of the Killing Joke.  Compare the examples and see which version you think you would like best.  Normally, I'd give this The Killing Joke five stars but this deluxe edition could have been so much better.  All the previous printings are worth hunting down.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|As a die hard SG1 fan,  I knew I was going to buy this movie  I know I am also going to buy Continium.    With that said, I think the movie was good,  but definitely not the best.  I think my main complaint is I miss Richard Dean Anderson.  I missed that wise cracking swash buckling role.  His just tell me where to shoot \\"Carter\\" personality helped balance the acadamic DR Jackson and Col Carter and his \\"MacGyver ( for lack of better term )\\" persona helped balance that muscle man named Telk.    I love Ben Bowder in Farscape,  but his character in SG1 is too much like a comic book super hero.      With that said,  I thought the story was good.  I felt the time the replicator story line took could have been better spent with the Odyssey battling the ORI fleet (arguably though we have seen enough of Odyssey/Daedalus space battles in SG1 and Atlantis).  The entire replicator story line was the movies main weakness.    I love Claudia Black.  Her character in SG1 is perfect for the show and makes up a \\"little\\" bit of what was missing from the Jack O'Neil character.    I was disappointed in not seeing much of Amanda Tapping.  Is her goal now to move behind the camera,  because you don't see her much in Atlantis also.    Overall this movie does a nice job wrapping up the ORI arc,  but despite its bigger budget and longer runs,  I felt that creators of SG1 did better jobs in previous episodes (Lost City 1 and 2, New Order 1 and 2 etc) with a lot less.    I hope RDA is back for the next movie !!!!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Though I'm not a big fan of musicals, this one definitely exceeded all expectations! Firstly, I happen to love the Beatles, so I was excited to watch this movie. Secondly, not only is the music phenomenal, but the actors actually sing the lyrics themselves and they do an extraordinary job. They do a great job of tying in the story line with the songs, or tying in the songs with the story line; regardless, the writers/producers/singers are spot on with this movie! I don't watch movies more than once often...but this I couldn't help but watch it again and again!
B000B9J4EI|5.0|Contrary to common belief, I Am Legend is not a vampire novel. What this book is in reality is a series a short horror stories written by Richard Matheson that range from the 160 page long story I Am Legend from which the book gets its name to a three page story called The Near Departed. Although I must admit that I Am Legend, the first and longest of the stories, is far and away the best, only talking about that one part does a disservice to the other ten incredible stories that are collected here. I will do a short review on each story in this book.<br /><br />I Am Legend, 5/5, 160 pages. WAY better then the movie.<br /><br />The new movie I Am Legend, staring Will Smith, takes place in New York City after a \\"cure\\" for cancer mutates and turns the worlds population into flesh eating zombie/vampire mutts that can only come out at night. the movie was unimpressive, the book is outstanding.<br /><br />Everyone knows the basic plot of this story, there is only one man left alive in a world full of vampires, but despite what you might expect from a plot like that this isn't an action novel. In fact there is very little in the way of action or suspense and for the most part in moves a slower pace. What makes this book amazing is the attention to detail that author Richard Matheson put into his post apocalyptic tale. Main character Robert Neville starts out about 3 months after last seeing another human being, held up in his house at night as thousands of undead vampires call for him to come out. every day is a rigid routine, fix the houses defenses, throw the dead corpses he finds on his lawn every morning into a fire, hunt for vampires, make stakes to hunt more vampires, and then back inside before nightfall and drink himself to death. As time goes by he starts to learn how to deal with the vampires, how they live and how they die; what they are and why the act the way they do. He conducts experiments, for instance why do vampires fear crosses? Why does garlic repel them? Why do only stakes kill them? Does said stake need to go though the heart to kill? These are all fascinating questions and we get answers to them all.<br /><br />But what makes this story a true masterpiece is the ending. I will not spoil it for you who haven't read the book yet (and I encourage you to do so as soon as possible) but lets just say that it is truly amazing. If you've seen the movie, brace yourself for a shock. I am very confused as to why any writer would want to tamper with such an amazing ending, why would anyone touch this gold?<br /><br />I Am Legend has been made into three motion pictures from the original The Last Man on Earth to The Omega Man to this years blockbuster I Am Legend. Not only that, but horror master George Romero said it was the inspiration for his horror classic Night of the Living Dead. Truly I Am Legend is one of the most influential horror stories in history.<br /><br />Buried Talents, 4/5, 8 pages. An interesting story.<br /><br />Right off the bat I expected another short story that takes place in the I Am Legend universe, but the rest of the stories are completely independent and have nothing to do with one another. Do not go into this story expecting to read more about Vampires and garlic.<br /><br />Buried Talents is a curies piece indeed. At only 8 pages this story brings up a lot of questions but never answers them, allowing the reader to come up with their own conclusions. In this short, a carnival man runs a booth where players try to throw ping pong balls into a fishing bowl to win a prize. No one seems to be able to do it, until a mysterious man walks up and lays down his quarters. He hits every shot, making the balls go into the bowl without so much as bouncing on the bottom, and then makes the two others land right next to them in the same fashion. He keeps this up for the whole story until the very end when the carnival man tells him to leave. Doesn't sound interesting right? Sound stupid? You'd be wrong. Once again, the ending is what makes this story good. Until the very last paragraph this story isn't anything special, but the last two lines make this a story to remember.<br /><br />The Near Departed, 3 pages, 5/5. Short and to the point.<br /><br />There really isn't a lot I can say about this gem of a story, not without giving away any spoilers. Think of this story as a joke, a three page joke and nothing more. Once again, the last paragraph of this story is simply amazing.<br /><br />Prey, 15 pages, 5/5. Chuckey's inspiration?<br /><br />Its inconceivable that one book, or rather a collection of short stories, could not only be the inspiration for Night of the Living Dead, but also for a little film called Child's Play this that might just be the case. Prey is a nail biting thriller about an African doll called \\"This is he who hunts\\" comes to life and starts attacking its owner. Although I don't know for sure whether or not this story inspired Childs Play, it is very safe to bet that the director of that film must have read this book and used it in some way. Although there are parts in this story that just don't make much sense (how can a doll overpower a full grown woman?) it is none the less a very entertaining read. If you liked Childs Play, you'll love this gem.<br /><br />With War, 7 pages, 3/5. Huh?<br /><br />Now this is a strange one indeed. Matheson goes for the surreal and the supernatural in this story even more so then previously, but in the end this story is just too off the wall to be taken seriously. set in an alternate world (or possibly WWI, its hard to tell) Witch War starts off with seven cute little girls talking happily with each other about, well, girl stuff. Gossip, cloths, hairstyles, stuff like that. Then a soldier enters the room and informs them of an upcoming attack.<br />\\"Oh my, here we go again,\\" one of them says.<br /><br />Outside in the rain a group of soldiers, supported by trucks and tanks, are attempting to attack the city the girls are supposedly in. Out of nowhere lightning starts to strike, lions and tigers jump out of the rain, the tanks blow up in huge fireballs and the mud starts to consume the troops as they run; you know, friendly stuff like that. Although this is an interesting story, I can hardly say it's up to the high standard set by previous entries.<br /><br />Dance of the Dead, 19 pages, 3/5. Leaves too many questions unanswered.<br /><br />I know I know, I said the same thing about Buried Talents and still gave that story a 4, so why not this one? Well, because this story tries to be a little more ambitious. For one thing it's longer and has room to expand and answer some of the questions it raises, and for another it creates a whole different world that is never explained or elaborated on. Set, I guess, some time in the not so distant future, the government is in a weakened state in the aftermath of a devastating war. four teenagers go on a trip to the city to see what they call the \\"Loopy Dance.\\" a Loopy, apparently, is a dead corpse that reanimates because of some chemical and does a strange kind of dance. Although the dystopian future intrigued me, nothing really happens of interest during this story, and that's the main reason for the lower rating.<br /><br />Dress of White Silk, 6 pages, 4.5/5. What just happened?<br /><br />That was my immediate reaction after reading Dress of White Silk. What happened? What did that ending mean? Although I have my guesses, there really is no way to know for sure that I'm right or wrong (don't worry, I won't spoil it for you). Written in the head of a young girl, maybe 7 years old give or take, this story is very simply written to say the least. Here's an example of the kind of writing you can expect.<br /><br />Pg , 213. \\"When I pretend I brush my hair long. But I only use my own brush from my room. I didn't never use mommas brush.\\"<br /><br />Although this kind of writing can be a little hard to get though, it is very appropriatefor the kind of story being told. It's told though the mind of a very little girl after all, so this incomplete writing is very nice to see and shows the versatility of Matheson. The ending is what truly got me hooked on this. It seems that almost every ending in this book is brilliant.<br /><br />Mad house, 72 pages, 5/5. Inspiration for Monster House?<br /><br />Yes, once again, Matheson delivers another inspiration for another movie, this time the kids film Monster House (Widescreen Edition), although the book itself is anything but kid friendly. Mad House is about struggling writer/professor whose life is leaving him and can't seem to control his anger. The angrier he gets, the more accidents he starts to have around the house. A rug slips out from under his feet, a pencil points break off and sticks into his finger, his chair falls down, ect. His friend warns him that he's afraid that if he doesn't control his anger, his house might actually turn on him, which of course is exactly what happens.<br /><br />This is one of the longer stories in this book, and also one of the best. The story makes the main character is sole focus, diving into he mind and fleshing out what kind of person he really is. Along with Robert Neville from I Am Legend, the main character from this story (I can't remember his name right now) is probably one of the best characters in this book. The story really is about him, at least up until Matheson gives us yet ANOTHER killer ending. My God, how many can be pull off?<br /><br />The Funeral, 10 pages, 3/5. My least favorite.<br /><br />Why is that? Well, because it's a not so funny comedy about vampires and goblins and such. a man tries to run a funeral home when a vampire walks in and say he wants a funeral because the one he had in real life wasn't that great and now he wants to make up for it. What follows is a somewhat humorous tale as all his vampire friends come for the ceremony and try to eat the poor owner. Overall a nice story but nothing great.<br /><br />From Shadowed Places, 25 pages, 4/5. Warning, graphic content ahead.<br /><br />This is, far and away, the most graphic of all the stories in this book. Naked people galore, African voodoo, more naked people, lots and lots of sexual content so if that's not your cup of tea stay away. The story itself really isn't half bad. A man is being tortured by some African witch doctor and is slowly dieing a horrible death. When his fianc&eacute; calls for help, they get their friend Dr. Howl, a woman who just happens to have been taught all about African voodoo while on a trip to the Dark Continent. But the only way she can get the voodoo out of him is to, uhh, get naked and pretend to be having sex with him, no kidding. Still a very good read.<br /><br />Person to Person, 23 pages, 5/5. The second best.<br /><br />After I Am Legend, Person to Person is my favorite story here. When a man starts hearing a phone in his head, he tries to find a way to make it stop, but to no avail. When he gets the bright idea to answer the phone (in his head of course) a mysterious stranger starts talking to him on the other end. Who is this man? A government agent testing a new way of communication? An inventor using him as a guinea pig? His long dead father? His uncounsis mind? Every time he \\"answers\\" the phone, he gets a different story. Little does he know that this voice in his mind has sinister plans for him. This story also has one heck of an ending. I'm surprised no one has made this story into a movie or something.<br /><br />OVERVIEW.<br /><br />You must read this book, whether or not you are a fan of the movies. This horror classic inspired so many movies and books it's not even funny. It inspired Romero's Night of the Living Dead, which inspired every other zombie movie every made, enough said. No horror fan can afford to be without this classic book. Do yourself a favor and buy it now.<br /><br />Re-read value; high.he tanks blow up in huge fireballs and the mud starts to consume the troops as they run; you know, friendly stuff like that.

I'm surprised no one has made this story into a movie or something.     OVERVIEW.     You must read this book, whether or not you are a fan of the movies. This horror classic inspired so many movies and books it's not even funny. It inspired Romero's Night of the Living Dead, which inspired every other zombie movie every made, enough said. No horror fan can afford to be without this classic book. Do yourself a favor and buy it now.     Re-read value; high.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Do not buy the abridged version of this.  You must get the Deluxe Edition.  It has all the songs from the entire movie, not just the highlights.  It's an amazing compilation of artists and songs from Beatles history.  I have it in my CD player at work, in my car, and at home...and I love it.  I can't get enough of it, and you shouldn't either.  By this CD...I humbly recommend it!

0743289692|4.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is undoubtedly a very controversial figure.  Her position as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a neoconservative think tank, often results in some on the left dismissing or not taking seriously her criticisms of Islam and the way women are treated in Islamic societies.  However, to dismiss her or her real-life accounts would be a huge mistake and there is something to be learned in her memoir \\"Infidel\\" no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.  At the same time, when reading this book, one should be aware that she gets more support from people who are anti-Islam than she does from Muslims or even Muslim women.    This book excels in providing a personal description and perspective on growing up in Somalia.  Her descriptions of her family and clan relationships as well as her discussion of school and significant events in her life, such as the forced circumcision of herself as well as her brother and sister can be difficult to read, but are important to understand that these types of relationships and events are common in far too many places.  It is also interesting from the perspective of learning about the different countries in which she lived and how things differed from a cultural and religious perspective.    The book is split into two sections: the first one covers her time as a willing participant in her family.  This is her early life, as she moved from Somalia to Saudi Arabia to Ethiopia to Kenya and so forth.  She provides an interesting and personal look at her family's life in each of those countries and the problems they faced in each of them.  In addition to the horrible account of her and her siblings forced circumcision, she also covers her first marriage/non-marriage and her forced marriage to a Somalian man who lived in Canada and her trip to Germany to await clearance to proceed on to Canada.  It was there that she decided to take control of her own life and that is where this section ends.    In the second section, she discusses her initial reaction and adjusting attitude to living in the west.  She talks about why she felt she had to lie to try to get asylum in the Netherlands as she was trying to avoid being found by her husband and their clan.  Her husband and clan do eventually catch up with her, but after they state the reasons why she should go with her husband, she is still allowed to say no, but this does sever her ties with her clan, and ultimately her father as well as he replies to her note asking for forgiveness and understanding with a very hurtful reply in which he cuts off communications with her and tells her to \\"Go to Hell!\\"    In this section, she is increasingly drawn towards learning about western society, yet fears that it may be compromising her own faith.  She struggles with both her family and her friends, especially her sister whose tragic story does at least serve to reunite Ayaan with her father.  Ayaan makes a return trip to Kenya under difficult circumstances, but decides it is her last.  She starts to make real decisions in her life, including to pursue a political science degree against the advice of others and to become a citizen of the Netherlands.  After 9/11 the conflicts between her upbringing and experiences in the west result in her leaving Islam behind and becoming an atheist.    The second section also covers her emergence as a public figure.  At first, working at a think tank for the labor party, and then speaking on television she enraged part of the Muslim community and found it necessary to come for a while to the United States.  She then found herself recruited by the Liberal party to return to the Netherlands and to be one of their candidates and ultimately be elected.  Her outspoken criticisms of Islam resulted in her being targeted by radicals, and her making of a short film \\"Submission: Part One\\" would result in the murder of its director Theo van Gogh.  The other key part in this section involves her near loss of Dutchcitizenship, which was initially revoked, and then restored.  Although, she was already looking to come to the United States at the time, the loss of her citizenship in the Netherlands could have caused her a great deal of difficulty in coming to America, and also could have put her life at risk.    Ayaan Hirsi Ali's story is a very interesting one, and this book is definitely one which is worth reading.  Many of the events are horrible, but they need to be discussed as it is important to know that these types of events still take place regularly outside the West, or in the case of honor killings even in the west.  While you may or may not agree with her position on Islam, it is certainly isn't a subject which should be taboo or which people should be afraid to discuss.
B000026OW3|5.0|This is the collection  for the ages. It has the best repertoire I had ever wished, and the quality of sound is excellent, knowing that the recordings were made in the 55's-65's period. I am fully satisfied with this product, for Rubinstein's interpretations are superb and the reference for all the pianists and audiences in general: They are emotive, harmonic, delicate and masterful. --USEFUL--: The last disc is Mono (recorded 1946), so it has  poor quality sound. The disc is the one of the Préludes Op. 28, and as an annex it contains the repeated and older recordings  of the Barcarole Op. 60, the Berceuse Op. 57, and the Sonata Op. 35 (these pieces come in the Stereo  discs too; i.e. repeated recordings). I do not miss the Préludes, so for me it is OK. Also this collection does not have the Études Op. 10 or the Op. 25. So if you want the Préludes and the Études to be in your colection, think buying this product twice. But if you do not care that much, buy it.
B00004BZ16|4.0|After an enthralling introduction to the Clash via their first album (albeit the U.S. version), I hooked onto this band.  They currently reside in the top spot on most of my High Fidelity-esque lists of \\"bests,\\" and I consider them my favorite band ever.  Even as a die-hard fan, Sandanista! perplexed me.  I heard such mixed reviews from band members, critics, and other fans, and I skeptically put it in my player.  I had heard tracks like \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and \\"The Call Up\\" before, since they frequently made it on \\"best ofs\\" and the singles CD, but I virtually knew none of the others.  I decided that, since I did not (and still do not) like \\"Hitsville U.K.,\\" I would move on to the second disc first.  I pressed play and experienced pure, exciting rock'n'roll in \\"Police on My Back.\\"  It continued with \\"Midnight Log,\\" and each track contained nuggets of sheer magic.  I'm still not finished listening.  I listen in bits and pieces, slowly hooking on to a song and playing it to death until I've fully assimilated it into my system.  Some favorite of mine include \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\" (The Clash's attempt at quasi-surf music), \\"The Equaliser,\\" \\"Junkie Slip,\\" \\"Up in Heaven (Not Only Here),\\" and \\"The Leader,\\" just to name a few.  This album rewards.  Sit through the whole thing a few times (not just once), then make a decision.  Ultimately, this experimental album pushes the borders of punk and redefines the Clash's view of music.  It exemplifies all the reasons I love the Clash: their experimentation, their music, melodies, and messages.  They stretch their musical muscles and we gain a new perspective on punk, life, and ourselves.

B00132D808|2.0|I LOVED their first album.  I am literally writing these notes as I listen to this new album for the first time ever.  I will rate it as I hear it.  I hope my buying this album without having heard any of it, based solely on the strength of their last album, won't end up burning me.<br /><br />__________________________________________<br />Track Number.) rating out of/5. Notes.<br />__________________________________________<br />01.) 3/5.  Cute opening, catchy, poppy.<br />02.) 4/5.  Their best song on the whole album.  Catchy, is lead into from the first track.  This song sounds very close to the sound of their old album.  I have a feeling it may end up being their first single, if it isn't already.<br />03.) 2/5.  Not digging this one.  Slow start, crooning.  Decent melody though.<br />04.) 3/5.  Meh.  Slow start, good melody, nice lyrics, but a little too ... meh ... 1 minute into it, it picks up slightly, but it is still kind of ... meh.  1:30 into it, it starts sounding more like their older stuff, which is better, finishes stronger.<br />05.) 4/5.  Starting out very good, fast paced, good melody, catchy lyrics.  So far my favorite, besides #2, which was pretty good too, ends strong.<br />06.) 1/5.  Gah, they are doing something weird with this one.  Twangy ukulele intro, and scratchy/radio sounding vocals, like an old recording.  Not liking this one at all so far.  1 minute in to this 2 minute \\"song\\" and it hasn't changed from the intro, so I guess this is the whole \\"song.\\"  Worst one on the album so far.  Maybe it was meant to be like an 'act break' or something?<br />07.) 2/5.  Slow guitar intro.  Unaccompanied vocal intro.  Decent, but not really rockin'.  Okay, accompaniment has started in, I think they are building up to something.  1 minute in, a duet has started -- not great -- not objectionable, 1:30 in, and drums and backup guitar have started.  Song is kind of stuck half way between a build up.  2:30 into the song now, it hasn't changed pace yet, or completed the build up.<br />08.) 3/5.  Slow violin start, guitars adding in.  Building up, cello added in now, vocals started.  Gah, they are slow again, okay, the pace is picking up, the back tempo is very good paced, the vocals are matching.  Horns added now.  Building up to something great, it sounds like.  Hitting the chorus now, seems pretty good.  2 minutes in now, not bad<br />09.) 3/5.  Good start, fast paced, interesting lyrics, simple song.  Not bad.<br />10.) 1/5.  Slow start, flutes, melancholy.  I am starting to regret buying the whole album on the strength of the last album.  Their most popular song on their last album was track #10, \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies.\\"  That song was fast paced, catchy, and poppy.  So far, we are 10 songs into this album, and none of the songs have even approached that level of a song.  This song, #10 on the new album, \\"The Piano Knows Something I Don't Know,\\" is a simple, and grating song.<br />11.) 1/5.  Slow, Beatles like (think yellow Submarine).  hate it.<br />12.) 2/5.  Country like, twangy, plain vocals.  Neither good nor bad<br />13.) 2/5.  Slow start, okay lyrics, okay vocals.  Pace never picks up, sort of a Irish song with a blend of old court type music, like something that sounds like a harpsichord?  Bleh.<br />14.) 1/5.  Sounds like county fair/circus performance music.  Okay vocals, okay melody.  Slow, plodding, there is even whistling in this song.  Gah, what the hell were they thinking with this album?!  None of the songs so far have come even CLOSE to the brilliance of \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies.\\"<br />15.) 3/5.  Last song.  Good beat, okay vocals, okay supporting guitar (and tambourine for no reason), drums added in now.  They are clearly going for a very Beatles-like sound in this album, that much is clear.  Now there is a melody back-up voice backup on the chorus.  The beat is still pretty good, but not catchy.  This song reminds me of songs from the 1960's/70's middle period.  You can't not make thecomparison to the Beatles.  Not great, but not bad.<br /><br />And there you have it, not a single 5 star song on the entire album.  How disappointing.  Overall, i rate the whole album 2.5 stars, if that.  There were a few 3 star songs, but mostly 2-ish songs, with a few 1 star songs.  I will not buy the next Panic album, without listening to it first.  How disappointing.  I hate it when bands do this.t, not a single 5 star song on the entire album.  How disappointing.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I checked this movie out from the local library. I liked it so much that I watched it three times and then bought it. It is a lovely story with very engaging acting. After the movie I had to read the novel. BBC did a wonderful job of adapting the story. The last line of the first hour, \\"I've seen the color of hell and it is white,\\" really stuck with me. The last 15 or 20 minutes of the movie are so romantic that I have watched it a dozen times. The music is not complex, but it is very effective.

B000YDOOU0|3.0|I've more a less a fan of Pat Metheny's early work..I saw him seven times between 1979-1987. His early work was innovative, inspired, and fresh. I lost touch with the 1990-2003 work, but have listened to The Way Up, which I found a bit less focused, but within the context of the Metheny Group(i.e, with Lyle Mays) he doesn't disappoint. Day Trip seems to be off the cuff, spontaneous noodling. Not a bad thing, and his supporting players are excellent, but nothing really memorable here. If you're a die hard fan, get this. If not, stick with American Garage-Travels, his best stuff.
B000PTYP5C|1.0|You would have to search the world to find a bigger DT fan than me.  I didn't want to rush this review, as there have been a few of their albums (TOT and FII leap to mind) that took a while to grow on me.    But unfortunately, time is NOT making this album any better.      Musically, it's not bad.  It's nothing we haven't heard from DT before.  Although the arrangements have more of the DT complexity than the (By their standards) simplicity of \\"Train of Thought\\", it didn't really blaze any new ground musically.     That in and of itself is not enough to get a bad DT CD review out of me though.  They  can keep hammering away at what they're doing, and I'm still happy.    No, the problem with this CD is that the lyrical content is so utterly juvenile that it distracts from the overall listening experience.  With the exception of \\"Prophets of War\\", which reminds us for the fourth time \\"The Great Debate\\", \\"In the Name of God\\", and \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" making up the first three) that DT should stay away from political songs, the lyrics sound precisely like the kind of drivel I wrote at age 13 when I was listening to too much Iron Maiden.    There are good spots on the album.  Nothing I would go so far as to describe as a good song, although \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" had the lyrical content sounded a little less like 12 year olds trying to scare one another around a campfire.  Even \\"Forsaken\\", a musical high spot, was ruined for me when I listened to it the first time and said \\"Dear lord, please tell me this isn't a song about a female vampire\\".    I love the band.  These are truly the four most gifted musicians on the face of the earth.  And James LaBrie's voice is in outstanding shape, improving with every album while he is at an age where mortal vocalists are watching their range and skill set decline.    But I'm truly sorry to say that this is their worst album ever.  The second worst (Falling Into Infinity, IMO) is so much better that if I had it to do over again, I would have bought a second copy of it instead of one of this.    The sad part is that a new fan might hear this and think this is what the band is usually like.  I would BEG them to check out \\"Scenes From a Memory\\", \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\", \\"Awake\\", Images and Words\\", and \\"Train of Thought\\".  If you like what you hear (And you will), and you're curious enough to check this one out, please take it with a grain of salt and try not to judge a band by its worst album.  Dream Theater deserves better.
B000M341QE|1.0|American movies have moved so far in the direction of unconscious self-mockery (think of \\"big-time\\" wrestling) that they and most of their viewers are not aware of just how far they have moved.<br /><br />My first attempt at a review of this film used so many asterisked expletives, simply to describe the verbal content, that it did not pass the Amazon censors.  Therefore, in this review I will simply say it is so replete with the expletive that describes the act of human procreation that, well, it is boring and embarrassing.<br /><br />The plot can be satirically summarized as four or five rat-like beings getting into a black van and trying to make a getaway while being shot at by ten or twenty of Boston's finest.<br /><br />The cops do NOT succeed in shooting out the tires, even though they fire off at least a hundred rounds of ammunition.  And that is the extent of  the \\"verisimilitude\\" of the film.<br /><br />There is a scene where Martin Sheen falls off a very tall building and lands at the feet of Leonard DiCaprio.  He lands on his back and still manages to look like Martin Sheen even though he has fallen at least ten stories. (His face is still recognizable.)<br /><br />I had the improbable thought that Sheen might simply have taken a few punches in the face from Ted Kennedy for a very bad imitation of Kennedy's Boston accent.<br /><br />The Departed is about as creative as Jack Nicholson's backside but has obviously pleased the video game crowd.  If you want social realism, avoid this film.  If you want adrenaline rushes from fantasy criminals and cops, buy it or pirate it.<br /><br />It was (un?)officially condemned by the Pope and the Boston Police Department so maybe it isn't as bad as I think it is.
0596009208|5.0|This book changed my life and the way I look at learning. After reading it, I wanted every \\"Beginning...\\" book to be written like this one. In my opinion, the whole Sierra & Bates  approach to learning styles is right-on. Thus, I enthusiatically read this work from cover-to-cover and in the end felt quite \\"satiated\\".     Only problem is, if you're already a well-versed programmer (like I was), you may find Kathy and Bert's approach frustrating.  Lots of pictures, lots of little notes, lots of (unnecessary) humor will tend to distract you from the goal of just learning Java and getting on with life.  Also, this book is not good as a later \\"reference\\" as the material is just not presented in such a way where all the relevant info is in one place.    Also, if you're studying for the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam, this book is NOT for you.  Kathy and Bert wrote another book targeted at that audience which is also quite excellent and enabled me to pass both the SCJP 5.0 and 6.0 effortlessly.
0596007124|5.0|I buy quite a bit of stuff from Amazon.  Don't we all. But all this while, I had never wrote a review.  Just never felt compelled to do so until getting this book.    Just awesome!    I'm a hobbyist programmer and never learned about design patterns in school. Understanding they're importance I tried learning. I really did.  But everything I read from articles to glances at different books just left me more clueless.      Except for a very small minority, this book will blow your mind (in a good way). I now understand why there are patterns, what the most popular ones are, and how to apply them.    Just get it.
0446401307|4.0|The Overlook is classic Michael Connelly.  Featuring Detective Harry Bosch, late of the LAPD's Homicide Special Squad, and his new partner Ignacio (Call me Iggy) Ferras it offers a mystery that contains all the excellent police procedural murder investigation elements that bears Connelly's signature coupled with an in depth look at the nasty little war that goes on between local and Federal government agencies when they are involved in the same case.<br /><br />It seems that the murder victim in this case is tied to the disappearance of radioactive material suitable for making a dirty bomb, so of course the FBI and Department of  Homeland Security come into the picture and proceed to play a nasty little game of hide and seek with a couple of witnesses thereby reeking havoc on Harry's investigation and thwarting him at every turn.<br /><br />Harry, of course, is not to be deterred in this cat and mouse game and author Connelly succeeds in providing  his readers with yet another story that is intricately plotted, filled with clever clues and misdirection and offers a read that is satisfying down to the very last page. 3 1/2 stars for this one

B000WMEAKC|4.0|It's not very often that a band from my home state of Colorado hits it big, but that's precisely what OneRepublic has done. With the help of Timbaland, the band scored one of the biggest hits of this decade to date with the remix of \\"Apologize\\", which spent 25 weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100, is one of only three songs to date to surpass three million in U.S. digital downloads, and spent 14 weeks at #1 on the United World Chart to name a few of its accomplishments. Needless to say I had to check out the band's debut album, especially considering how addicted I was to \\"Apologize.\\" The album is one of those \\"singles\\" albums in my opinion, where about 5 of the songs are great and sound like big hits, but a lot of the album is filler.     Unsurprisingly to me, I did not find another song I liked as much as the Apologize remix, which is a bonus track on the album. Although I dislike that the remix is credited to Timbaland featuring OneRepublic (it should be vice versa), I have to admit there's something about the remix that sends the song into that upper echelon of mega hit that only happens rarely, and the original version of the song just can't compete. The song is much more than just a hit though, as everything about the remix is the total package of lyrics, beat, hooks, and vocal performance that seamlessly meshes to make it one of those universally likable songs. Enough about that song though, the rest of the album has some other tracks that are worth talking about,  starting with second single \\"Stop and Stare.\\" The song seems to be about evaluating your life and questioning why it is the way it is. The song has a big chorus and is one of the most re-playable tracks on the album.  \\"Mercy\\" is a more rock tinged affair that first gained the band notice when they put it on their MySpace. It is somewhat reminiscent of a song U2 would do, and is well written and produced. My favorite track besides \\"Apologize\\" would have to be \\"Say (All I Need)\\" a song that crescendosfrom a gorgeous soft rock ballad into a soaring melodically layered piece of music. Most definitely a hit, but more importantly a superb song, and I have to also note that lead singer Ryan Tedder gives an exceptional vocal as well on it. The album isn't all good news though, as about exactly half of the tracks are filler that go in one ear and right out the other. Songs such as \\"Prodigal\\", \\"Tyrant\\", and \\"Won't Stop\\" to name a few just leave no real impression on me.    What saves \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" from being disappointing is that the good half of the album overshadows the unmemorable portion. It's been a while since I've heard tracks as overall well put together such as \\"Apologize\\", \\"Stop and Stare\\", and \\"Say (All I Need).\\" Other highlights are \\"All We Are\\" and Coldplay esque ballad \\"Come Home.\\" The band also seems to be talented lyrically as well, and Ryan Tedder might be quite the up and coming producer/songwriter already having huge production/writing hits for other artist such as Natasha Beddingfield's \\"Love Like This\\" and the mega worldwide smash \\"Bleeding Love\\" by Leona Lewis. \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" is a promising debut that is satisfying but leaves plenty of room for future growth. 4/5 Stars    My Top 5:  1. Apologize (Remix)  2. Say (All I Need)  3. Mercy  4. Stop and Stare  5. All We Are
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Despite the constant banter and bickering about the Motion Picture versions destroying the originals, these hold to their own soul, texture, and style. Jim Sturgess delivers smooth vocals that is fairly comparable to Paul McCartney but makes it his own. Evan Rachel Wood's haunting vocals breathe new life into songs like \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"If fell.\\" Joe Anderson redefines such classics like \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Hey, Jude.\\" With Dana Fuchs and Martin Luther's powerful vocals reigniting \\"Oh! Darlin\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" this album is a must for anyone who thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and for any Beatles fan willing to give it a chance. Taking it from a Beatles fan, you shouldn't be disappointed.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|This movie is really, really crazy. Not for the weak of heart or stomach. You will see lots of T&A and a few other things you did not sign up for. Many say this is a very accurate potrayl of Caligula's reign in Rome. Be that as it may it really just came across as a demented, disturbing soft/hard core porn.

B000002UAI|5.0|This is an album I first bought when it came out in 1964. Today it again shows the fine musicianship and arrangements of the songs, and shows what a great band the Beatles were.  Tracks like No Reply, Every Little Thing, Eight Days a Week are rarely featured songs in Beatles flashbacks, but are worthy of any reprise.  This is a very good album indeed.

B000ULQV0W|4.0|Worth the price. Vedder does a great job making the soundtrack for this movie. He actually created after the movie was made which is outstanding.  Glad I purchased it.
B0000714BP|5.0|This was a surprisingly good movie.  Sweet, a good message and you just have to see Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze & John Leguizamo in drag.
B000Y9Q59W|5.0|Great movie! Although better quality than a DVD but not that impressive for a blu ray.
B0007OCG56|5.0|This is a great story.  Adam Sandler does a great job of acting, not just being funny.  Great cast.
0452289963|5.0|This book is a bit of a hard read in the beginning, but it is certainly worth keeping with it.  Truly, light bulbs go off in your head!!
B000A59PMO|4.0|Veronica Mars was a great show, a refreshing change to see a realistic female character on TV who didn't have to kick literal butt like Buffy or Sydney to be assertive. Because that's one of the key things I like about Veronica - she's a great action character without all the action.    The show itself can be described as an amalgamation of The OC, Twin Peaks and maybe Nancy Drew (though I haven't had the pleasure). It's well constructed from the start, with an overarching story as well as weekly whodunnits. The balance between the storylines are maintained well, although one can feasibly put all the pieces of the overarching storyline together from the first 8 episodes.    All the characters are great, although I do sometimes find it unsettling watching something that is so close and yet so far from reality. The show manages to portray teen and adult situations with a better understanding than some shows like The OC, but the protagonist herself is an incredibly unrealistic character, always on the case. Although being the daughter of a PI gives her a better excuse than some, I guess.    1* deducted because of zero extras. Boo.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I don't know why anyone would give this move a poor rating. The plot was excelent, the FX were mind blowing, and the acting was superb. I really loved the realism of the dynamics of a group of people struggleing to survive in a small grocery store while under attack by creatures of another dimension.    If your looking for a good intellectual yet intense thrill ride, I recommend at least renting this movie.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|This is one of my favorite Stephen King stories. I have the radio play from ZBS Media, which is quite good. This film version is a huge disappointment. It was very good up until the ridiculous ending. The original version had an excellent conclusion, which kept things open-ended and mysterious. This director decided to tack on a ham-fisted attempt at irony, which sinks the entire concept.  Not only does he ruin the subtle sense of mystery and glimmer of hope in the original conclusion with an army-to-the-rescue scene; he puts the protagonist into a fate-worse-than-death scenario (that he didn't deserve), creating a \\"Dagwood sandwich\\" of jarring unpleasantness. It's also too bad that the fabulous music of Dead Can Dance was part of this dreadful sandwich-of-doom. Why do directors and screenwriters feel compelled to wreck decent source material?  A redeeming element to the disc is a brief overview of the poster artist.
B0000041XX|4.0|Arrived in fine time. Knew what I was getting, based on several viewings and listenings on PBS. Met my expectations. Good quality of used CD.
B00005JPTK|4.0|The two disc special edition with the digital copy of \\"I Am Legend\\" not only has the version seen in theatres but also an alternative ending - one that has a totally different conclusion than the theatrical release. But it too differs from what was written in the Richard Matheson short story of the same name, and it really isn't that much better, so be warned. The bonus features include four animated short films, all related to the movie. The digital copy (on the second disc with the alternate version) allows you to copy the film to your computer taking up less space on your hard drive than if you copied it from the DVD alone - that is, if you like to watch movies on your PC. There are also bonuses you can view BUT you can only access them by inserting the DVD into your computer - you can't do it with just a regular DVD player. Too much of a pain to deal with, IMO. If you can do without all of the extras included here, then I suggest you stick to the single disc version of this film - it's cheaper.<br /><br />As for this latest version of the famous Matheson post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller (there were two previous ones, \\"The Last Man On Earth\\" {with Vincent Price, 1964} and \\"The Omega Man\\" {with Charlton Heston, 1971}), it starts off strong, with Will Smith as the lone human survivor on earth of a virus that originally was developed as a cure for cancer, but went terribly awry, killing most of the world's population. Smith in his role as military scientist Robert Neville (who is immune from the virus) is intense, and his only companion is his dog Sam, a loyal german shepherd that he raised from a puppy. Sam is the only link to the lonely Neville's past and his family.<br /><br />For the first hour or so of the movie, you are totally transfixed by Smith's heartfelt solitary performance and the interaction with his canine companion. In this case, the dog is definitely Neville's best friend - and his only friend, as the two of them depend on and protect each other in a desolate world. We see flashbacks of just how Robert Neville ended up in this tragic and unenviable position. Will carries the film surprizingly well on his own, as he attempts to achieve some kind of normalcy by having conversations with his dog and mannequins he set up in a store, pretending that they are living and breathing beings like himself. He and Sam live life from day to day alone - listening to reggae legend Bob Marley's music for inspiration, send out messages with the hope there is someone else out there like them and fight to survive against violent, blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures (courtesy of CGI) that lurk in dark places during the day and roam free at night. These beings were once human, but they were infected by this virus and survived - and this is what they mutated into. Neville works tirelessly to find a cure before it's too late (\\"I can still fix this!\\") so perhaps these creatures can once again become human.<br /><br />The introduction of two other human characters into the story who have traveled to a decimated New York City where Neville is - this is the point where the movie begins to lose steam. This is unfortunate, because the first part of this film really showcases just how exceptionally good Smith has become as an actor. It certainly doesn't hurt that the guy is so appealing and likeable in nearly everything he does. This withstanding, it's the second hour of the movie that falls flat. Even with the action sequences, it doesn't captivate you like the first hour did, where there was relatively little of that. You don't really feel any emotional connection to the woman and the little boy she has with her; I cared more about the fates of Neville and his german shepherd. I found the ending to be a disappointment, and having read the Matheson novel, I felt that if the screenwriters had remained faithful to the ending of the book, it might have had ended better - not happier because it isn't that type of movie - but at least you wouldn't have felt cheated. The film itself, like the two that preceded it, differs greatly from the book, but some of the changes made here worked very well - and some not so well. But \\"I Am Legend\\" is worth watching, at least for the first hour and to see Will Smith's amazing performance.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 starsd. The film itself, like the two that preceded it, differs greatly from the book, but some of the changes made here worked very well - and some not so well.

1594489505|4.0|If I had read this book first, before \\"The Kite Runner,\\" I would have rated it a full 5 stars, but compared to Hosseini's first best seller, I found this one less compelling. It is a darker story and more depressing, but unfortunately, probably very true to life experiences of many Afghan women. An excellent window into the lives of many similar women. I appreciated the author's compassion to their plight. Book arrived on fine time, in good condition.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is an amazing movie, proving that makers of cinema do not have to alter historical facts to create compelling drama.<br />The acting is superb. Ioan Gryffudd presents a convincing hero in William Wilberforce.  He is supported by an excellent cast which includes Albert Finney and Michael Gambon who play their roles as convincingly as Gryffudd does his.<br />The storytelling itself can be a bit misleading as the story is told in flashbacks and if one is not paying attention one can lose track of which time period is being shown.  But it is a small distraction.<br />Amazingly accurate in its historical detail, amazingly engaging in its story, Amazing Grace is a must have for any DVD library.
0143143492|5.0|I was shocked at how much this cd made me go back to myself and check my own ideas and behaviors.  Truly made me look at myself and the world around me with new eyes.  I am not sure if I have awakened, but I do believe this has planted the seed.  Thank you Mr. Tolle.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Their voices and harmonies never sounded better. This is classic Eagles for the most part which means you're going to find yourself singing along after just hearing the songs a few times. While I can't say I'm a huge fan of Schmidt's songs - has a little too much \\"boy band\\" sound for me, even his songs are starting to win me over. Frye and Henley's vocals are superb - amazing how Henley has kept that sexy, slight laryngitis sounding voice for all these years! Joe is still Joe, singing Guilty of the Crime - just makes me feel good! I definitely prefer the 1st CD as it seems to be more classic Eagles sound. Rates up there as one of my favorites.
074356619X|5.0|The Secret on Audio CD is just a great buy especially for anyone who does a lot of driving -- or for us in California, doing a lot of sitting in traffic.  It's very inspirational, and I just can't recommend it enough.

All I can say is thank you Jillian for making such a great-fun-time friendly workout!
1416524800|3.0|Deception Point by Dan Brown<br /><br />Dan Brown, for many, has been the thriller writer for the past few years. The Da Vinci Code and its prequel Angels and Demons both did incredibly well and helped him eclipse even Stephen King and John Grisham for a time.<br /><br />This outing is similar to his other three books - a big conspiracy, a race to solve some problem with world-wide ramifications, and some sort of code-breaking/problem-solving component. Here, the plot revolves around NASA's discovery of life on other planets. A meteor found embedded in the Arctic is discovered by scientists with fossils of giant bugs that look to confirm life outside of Earth. Swirling around this discovery is an intense political confrontation between a president who has been hammered on excessive spending, especially on NASA, and an up-and-coming senator willing to do whatever it takes to be elected.<br /><br />I finished the book in two days, which gives you some sense of the sharp pacing of Brown's book. In many ways, I wished \\"literary\\" writers took a page from the Dan Brown's and John Grisham's of the world - literary fiction and beautiful writing/prose does not mean that the pace has to plod on and on and a plot has to be limited to the mundane, the every day.<br /><br />Overall, this book was entertaining up until the last 50 pages where Brown had to find a way to neatly wrap up his many plotlines. The tension is well-done and this is certainly the kind of book you can read between books that actually require you to think and engage with the text, which is what I did. Don't expect to be blown away, but enjoy being able to turn your brain off for a few hundred pages.

0307346609|1.0|Like most readers, I'm a zombie fan.  I went into it with fairly low expectations, figuring one takes what one can get from zombie fiction, but even those were disappointed.    The \\"oral history\\" layout with the story divided into short vignettes seemed like an interesting approach, but fell down in practice.  The voice of the stories did not change much from one to the next, with a few exceptions, which came off as overblown and unbelievable.  Instead, each story just sounded like Max Brooks.  I frequently found myself flipping back to the beginning of the story to see who I was supposedly listening to.    The \\"interviews\\" read like standard first-person fiction, if slightly more casual.  Combined with the failure to effectively change voice, the  style of the book felt like a crutch.  This made the lack of a continuous storyline frustrating, as it didn't really offer any value in its place.    Brooks is at his worst when he gets political.  Characters are portrayed either as selfless heroes or caricatures taking positions that only their most naive opponents would ascribe to them.  The attempt comes off as ham-handed and ignorant.      The inclusion of serious themes (if childishly presented) made it hard to overlook other errors or implausibilities in the book.  For example, the US West Coast as a safe zone in a plague that began in China, a gross misrepresentation of the effects of artillery on a standing-room-only crowd, and Chinese lamenting the (more famous in the West) Cultural Revolution rather than the Great Leap Forward, which killed 10-100 times as many people.
B0015T7Q98|3.0|For the record, I hated A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. I thought it was a joke of an album and sounded like it came straight from the circus.   That being said, when I heard the single \\"Nine In The Afternoon,\\" I was impressed. Panic(!) At The Disco managed to write a song that didn't sound like a cheesy theater production soundtrack. The single is promising, and there is a definite Beatles influence throughout the song and the rest of the album. That's not to say it's as good as the beatles. By the tenth track or so, I was bored of listening and wondering when it would end. This album is a step in the right direction of making good music for Panic, but it's still not good.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby's Digital Photography Book is an excellent guide to getting the most out of your digital camera.   As the new owner of a Nikon D40X DSLR, Scott's tips on how to shoot like a pro are already paying dividends for me.     I'm sure they will benefit anyone looking to improve their mastery of the digital medium.   I'm sending a copy to my father with a note to throw away all the other photo books he has and to focus on Scott's easy, step by step directions.     Want to shoot weddings like a pro?  It's in there.  Want to capture landscapes like a pro?  It's in there too.  Want to know the best time of day to get those postcard perfect wildflower shots?  Oh, yeah...in there.    Scott also gives you the low-down on equipment, detailing tripod and lens choices based on your budget, not his.    Scott concentrates on what the pros do to get \\"The Shot\\", without all the jargon and double speak of other books.     I'm re-reading it and will keep it in my camera bag for years to come!  Thanks Scott.

B000QQFKYE|2.0|Three solid hours of nonsensical, esoteric allusions to reincarnation. It grapples with the deep truth that our current lives can be likened to a needle stuck in a record groove as our dormant spirits go through life in a vulgar body entriely unaware that we are treading the same doomed path we have trod time and time before; only in this film Laura Dern seems to lose the comfort of that unawareness and all her lives start playing out at once.      It is so abstract and goes on for so long it gets nigh on impossible to enjoy. Also, much like Twin Peaks, it offers no hope or positive energy, only an overwhelming sense of the all-consuming, dark void over which we have no control, making for a very bleak and unforgiving experience.       Not one to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.
B000W07EKW|5.0|AWESOME!  I'd already seen them all but just had to get the movies and watch them back to back.  The author has great books too and the movie follows them quite well.  Great for Matt Damon fans too.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Having seen Celine Dion live at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, we were hoping the Blu-Ray disk of that concert would be worthy of that performance. Is it? Let's just say we were OVERWHELMED!!! The picture, the sound and the entire presentation was PHENOMENAL....we would highly recommend this disk to everyone, fans of Celine or just those who appreciate good \\"Theatre\\" and superlative performance. We viewed this on a SONY SXRD 1080P 60 inch screen, and it displayed the \\"State of the Art\\" Blu-Ray disk so spectacularly it was breathtaking!! Highly recommended!!
B0013D8LOU|2.0|Caveat: I still think nothing compares to the original Broadway performances of Sweeney Todd.  While I applaud Tim Burton for making Steven Sondheim's masterpiece accessible to a new generation, the musical performances here seem flat and limited in comparison.  Helena Carter lacks the cheery, bubbly desperation of Angela Landsbury's Mrs. Lovett; Johnny Depp's voice seems flat and even smarmy -- without the seething, powerful rage of George Hearn or Len Cariou (on the original cast album).  This is a slick Hollywood production and is only OK in its own right. Other productions (even Patti Lupone / George Hearn's concert performance) are far better musically.  This film/soundtrack demonstrates the superiority of true stage professionals -- sadly, the cast here does not deliver the full power, humor, and twisted beauty of this classic story of inhumanity and descent into madness.  This Hollywood production lacks a lot in comparison; Burton butchers it a bit -- omitting significant elements of the story, and goes overboard on over-the-top blood and gore, yielding a campy horror flick.  It lost the balance that a production of this masterpiece should have: humor/tragedy - hope/despair - beauty/darkness.  For the full story, check out the DVD/soundtracks of earlier productions.  You're in for a treat.
B0000844M8|5.0|What can I say, a real classic film that always brings tears to my eyes.  Kids will enjoy this film too.  If you haven't seen it, buy it!
B00004YX39|2.0|\\"Hey Ninteen\\" is a great track, and \\"Babylon Sisters\\" rocks, but the whole thing sounds like the Dan on auto-pilot and, though it is a bit tiresome to judge records this way, doesn't come close to mid-70's classics like Countdown to Ecstasy and Katy Leid.  The middle sction drags, and its a chore to listen straight through, even though the album only runs to 38 mintes.  Still, \\"Hey Nineteen\\" is one killer tune.  \\"The Cuervo Gold/ The fine columbian/ Make tonight a wonderful thing.\\"  Indeed, but read between the lines and this is as unsettling a song as the band ever wrote.  It belongs elsewhere, apart from the remainder of an insipid record.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|This CD rocks and is very inspiring. The lyrics make you think about life in general and all the things around you. Love it. Love it.Would recommend to buy.
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|How could a man so young be so bitter?  And how could it all sound so great, even so life-affirming?  Not a misstep on the record, every song here is written and exists; these are not just words set to music, they have the quality of folksongs transmitted orally over generations.  Some of the really world weary, misanthropic songs that would pervade 1975's Pour Down Like Silver, but there is a little bit more af a joyous atmosphere working here, despite songs like \\"The End of the Rainbow\\": \\"Life seems so rosy from the cradle/ but I'll be a friend, I'll tell you what's in store/ there's nothing at the end of the rainbow/ there's nothing to grow up for anymore.\\"      A true folksinger, Thompson is so at home in the genre that he is not even working within the genre, but has become it in a way... Linda Thompson has, in my opinon, one of the most affecting, if not strictly beautiful, voices I have ever heard.  Listen to her on \\"Has He Got a Friend\\" where she begs for a date: \\"If you know someone who's graceful and wise/ doesn't mind girls who are clumsy and shy/ I don't mind going with someone who I've never seen.\\"  Or on \\"Down Where the Drunkards Roll\\": \\"You could be a gambler who never drew a hand/ you could be Lord Jesus, all the world would understand/ down where the drunkards roll.\\" Her voice floors me, leaves me shaken with goosebumps.
B000FKO0Q0|2.0|2 stars because the movie itself, all though now old and dated, is still edge of the seat entertainment and very well produced.  However, on HD DVD, the audio and video quality is extremely poor, well below par and I think far worse than the original DVD.   I had friends around and was showing off my HD DVD player and was so embarrassed after watching the first 20 mins or so that I turned it off and played a DVD !   0 stars for the general movie quality, it is appalling!    \\"Don't waste your money on this horrible HD version.\\"
B00004Y6NT|2.0|Interesting to see so much love for this; I find it sluggish, derivative of the debut, inessential, a sophomore slump.  Still, it sounds pretty good and can be a pleasant listen if one doesn't concentrate too hard.  \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is a promising start, one of the better tracks, with Knopfler's sardonic writing in force, \\"Sitting on the fence, that's a dangerous course/ You could even catch a bullet from the peace-keeping force,\\" but \\"News\\" stutters and \\"Where Do You Think You're Going\\" gets going only in the last minute.  From \\"Communique\\", the album mellows a bit, and with a hint of flamenco and a hint of funk and the title track is a nice tune, though far from truly vital.  The single, \\"Lady Writer\\" is rehashed Sultans of Swing, but a catchy song for all that, and so on...the songs taken on their own are just fine, but the sum is considerably less than its parts.
1594489505|5.0|Powerful read, not for the faint of heart.  The brutal reality of life in Afganistan from decades in the past to today is at times shockingly brought into focus by Khaled Hosseini.  Your heart goes out to the suffering of thousands of innocent human beings. No amount of reading the newspaper or listening to talking heads can match this books picture of what has happened and continues to happen in this part of the world.
B000002KCI|4.0|More of a polished effort than the preceeding Tonight's the Night and On the Beach, but, paradoxically or not, a lesser album than either of these masterpieces.  \\"Don't Cry No Tears\\" is a fine, upbeat opener, and is followed by the accomplished but inessential Crazy Horse workout \\"Danger Bird.\\"  \\"Lookin' for a Love\\" is a pop song of the sort that Young has written reletively few, but has an edgier side, \\"I hope I treat her kind, and don't mess with her mind/ when she starts to see the darker side of me\\" that belies its pretty, poppy surface.  It's also a fine tune.  The album's center is \\"Barstool Blues\\" an excellent song which demonstrates clearly why Young is considered the godfather of grunge.  Thematically, \\"Barstool Blues\\" would nestle well into Tonight's the Night litany of strung-out drug songs, but with a slightly more produced sheen it here is fits perfectly, and, arranged as it is, seems to point to a way out of the bar and into the light of the street.  \\"Stupid Girl\\" is a bit low, but contains more notable guitar pyrotechnics that presage the late 70's goldern age of Crazy Horse with albums like Rust Never Sleeps and Live Rust.  Of course, the standout track is \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" a pivotal song in Young's career, and one of his very greatest.  While highly suspect as historical interpretation, the slow burn guitar buildup, Young's obvious sincerity, and the frenzied soloing combine to form a masterpiece of songwriting and musicianship.
0375842209|5.0|Outstanding read.  I had not previously read anything by Zusak.  This is one very gifted writer. Powerful story, great character development.  It has all that a book lover could ask for.
B00132D808|5.0|When I preordered this item I was pumped, especially since they said the Beatles were their inspiration.  This album was very different from their first, but I welcomed it.  The tunes definatlely sound like they were inspred by the Beatles but since nobody can ever outdo the Beatles it falls somewhat short.  Though this album is enjoyable, I prefer their first.  This album deserves to be heard.
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|No it's not a great movie. It's a fun movie. The action is great. Milla is just beautiful in every scene. The comic book atmosphere and the camera angels/shots are really terrific.<br /><br />I do like this version much better than the extended cut.
0385338724|5.0|The characters of Sophie Kinsella books always remind me a little of the Amelia Bedelia books I read when I was little.    This book was so fun and different that the Shopaholic books.  Lexi, the main character, was a regular girl living in London, enjoying life with a new job with her best girlfriends and an awful boyfriend.  The night before her dad's funeral she trips and hits her head, only to wake up 3 years later in a hospital bed with amnesia of the past three years.  It seems she was actually in a bad car accident that had taken her back to that night three years ago and erased her mind of the three years of the most major changes she had ever made in her life.    Over the next few weeks Lexi has to piece together her life, her new friends and family and find out what happen to her old friends.  How could everything have changed so dramatically in three years and how can she fix it?  It's such a fun story because you get to piece it together with her!
0060594896|3.0|I am not sure why this bothers me so much, but it really does: Jack, could you not have found a photo of yourself that shows you looking HEALTHY instead of SUNBURNT?  What is even more perplexing about this bothering me so much is that my \\"criticism\\" of the book is that the examples are rather \\"materialistic\\".  I know that that is how most people start to \\"design\\" their lives, but then SAY that!  Explain that the first \\"layer\\" is to be like a kid in a candy store with unlimited funds and indulgent parents, THEN go on to the next 2 steps of Stephen Covey's Have-Do-Be.  I find it interesting that the creator of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series should have stayed so much on the meterial plane, so to speak.  When I read the book for the first time, I thought that my \\"resistance\\" must be my \\"fault\\"; that I was just angry with the principles.  But I have read the book again-twice, in fact-and I realized that the principles are brilliant (I have even started implementing most of them in earnest), my \\"imaptience\\" and \\"irritation\\" would come when Canfield would manage to soundboth slick and sanctimonious in the same paragraph, if not the same sentence!<br /><br />To those who complain that ther is \\"nothing new\\" in this book, I say, true, AND CANFIELD NEVER PROMISED OTHERWISE.  As a matter of fact, he explains several times that this book came from  the distillation ofseveral years's worth of reading the success literature.  Good for him!  Why should such an undertaking be limited to the PH.d candidate?  For those who complain that no book can change you, that YOU have to do the work, again I say, TRUE, and SO DOES CANFIELD!<br /><br />In short, I would say that this is a good overview, but, as a few of the reviewrs have said, in so many words, you can't beat the classics and, to be fair to Canfield, he includes an extensive bibliography and \\"further reading\\" list in this volume.  So, by all means, start with this but do remember that this is not the be all and end all either.
B0012QE4QC|2.0|Have you ever noticed how Cliff Notes generally do a fair job telling the plot of a story and a poor one handling the characters. Then in the case of character driven pieces they do an even poorer job.<br /><br />Well watching this movie felt like the director sent an assistant to read the Cliff notes, then got the assistant drunk and then based the story on what the assistant told him<br /><br />Henry the VIII is not exactly praised in the book, but he's not a rapist.<br /><br />But Henry is not the only character mutilated in such a fashion. The books rich tapestry of feelings and sublety is shredded in a way that cannot simply be blamed on the change of format from book to movie.<br /><br />Almost every role is dreadfully miscast, especially William Stafford, who in any responsible adaptation should have been a man of clear ability, not doe-eyed innocence. The all important son is basically ignored and that's just the beginning.<br /><br />I don't know how the author is responding to this \\"version\\" of her work, but as a reader I went in to see a screen version of the Other Boleyn Girl and over two hours later I was still waiting. (Yes, that was a paraphrase of a review of Our Town, but unlike it's original use, this time the work deserves it.)
0618526412|5.0|This is one of my favorites!    This is the first McCullers' book that I have read and it has become one of my favourites. It felt like a timeless story that could have been written only yesterday instead of in the 1930's. It also could have been written by a much older, experienced person instead of a young girl of 23 years. It is a gentle, sad story that might have been typical of small town life. It was very refreshing to feel submerged in the slow pace and emotion of life in a long gone era. The story touched me in an unexpected way, and I know I will long remember the characters and their individual stories.   The story is about a deaf mute named John Singer, who after his best friend(also a deaf mute) Antonapoulos is sent to an asylum becomes lonely, four other characters also become lonely due to some result of isolation; Dr. Copeland is seperated by his family and his race because of his high education and viewpoint; Jake Blount is angry because the radical social viewpoints he has, won't be understood by anyone else in the town; Mick Kelly cannot communicate with her family because of they do not share her interests and ambitions; Biff Brannon becomes alone when his wife dies and ponders and struggles to resolve inner conflicts in life. The book isn't too long and the pace isn't too slow. The dialogue, pace, and tone is astonishing. It is a great book that I highly reccomend Another title that I suggest reading is [[ASIN:0060531045 One Hundred Years of Solitude]].
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This group of Irish women keeps getting better and better under the direction of David Downes...he has no equal in arranging and producing in this genre.  I love the castle setting of this second concert DVD and their Christmas DVD is wonderful also. I look forward to their next project and I'd love to see a combination of The High Kings and Celtic Woman - a full-blast, star-studded event!
B000P12LWY|2.0|I was hoping for some great commentary, what decisions they made, when and why they differed from history, the costumes and scenery. Instead only a 3 extremely short features are on the final disc, along with advertising for other Showtime series. Finally, the information on each disc about which episodes are on which discs is incorrect!<br /><br />Not only that but these discs featured DRM, so I could not play them on my laptop when travelling, I could only play them on a windows Vista machine that I happen to have an HDMI compliant videocard and monitor. But it would not play on any XP machine.<br /><br />All in all, an extremely poor set created for a tv series that I enjoyed.

B00003CXRM|5.0|This is probably my favorite of all the Coen Brothers productions.  I love the period, the music of the era, and the cinematography.  It is all very absurd, and there are references throughout to Ulysses.  The acting is great - over the top, and the cast of characters are somehow the perfect mix.  Seems like each time I watch this, I see something new. George Clooney is just perfect in the Ulysses role, with John Turturro and Tim Black Nelson as his stumbling and earnest sidekicks.  John Goodman is the cyclops, and Holly Hunter is a delight.  I recommend film this to anyone who delights in the absurdity of life.  It will make you laugh out loud, and the music will play in your mind for days.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I don't believe there's a movie role out there that Renee couldn't take on and bring her special charm to it...she is so believable and endearing as Miss Potter.  Ewan is like adding icing to the cake in this story - he's so handsome and lovable.

B0000027I6|3.0|This very lackluster effort by Roger Waters is not even close to being in the same league with his earlier solo efforts: Pros and Cons of Hitchiking and Radio K.A.O.S. Those albums are much more substantive, creative and original than ATD, which borrows every sound effect from them and earlier Waters/Floyd. I love PACOH and KAOS so much, was sure I'd love ATD, and after listening too many times, I have to say I'm done with anything new by Waters (Live in the Flesh DVD was horrible), and I'm going to check out the Gilmour side of things...<br /><br />UPDATE: OK, I've listened more and while my impression has improved somewhat, for me it's not nearly as enjoyable as his previous work. 3 and a half stars.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Equal parts 2001, Solaris, with a bit of Alien and, unfortunately, Event Horizon thrown in... The Event Horizon part, which rears its ugly head in the third act puts a slight damper on, what is otherwise, a stellar science fiction film. The premise places a crew of astronauts on a last ditch mission to reignite a dieing sun where an identical mission had failed without a clue as to why or how. This is their last chance so, if they fail, it is the end of mankind. The journey is on its last leg as their ship, The Icarus II, approaches Mercury for a final gravitational push towards the sun.<br /><br />This time is where we are introduced to the crew and the visual and aural language of the film. It is beautifully shot with the expected semi-sterile shipboard visuals interspersed with the warm oranges and yellows of the sun which is seen through a filtered viewing room as a contrast that seems all too attractive to some of the crew. The dramatic views from outside of the Icarus II shows a wondrous outer-space being invaded by this awkward looking flying antenna at the end of a huge bomb. The crew seems like they are really on a mission, which keeps the proceedings convincing. They aren't given too much personality, which is reasonably assumed a product of their circumstances and/or the film makers' need to reinforce that. The accompanying soundtrack is appropriately sparse and spooky. It's a perfect compliment to the visuals.<br /><br />The first wrinkle in the plot is introduced when the Icarus II receives a distress signal coming form the derelict Icarus I and this is what will become the driving force for the rest of the film. A fateful decision must be made whether to investigate or not.<br /><br />All of the ensuing story is dramatically and visually compelling. The immense weight of the mission is always evident and it helps create a connection to the characters and a nail-biting sense of dread for their potential failure. Then, the Event Horizon element is introduced and things trip up a bit. Not to give too much away, but the physical manifestation of the antagonist does not gel very well with the rest of the style of the film and causes it to step into the realm of run and chase slasher films. However, it is not enough to ruin Sunshine and, by all means, only reduces it from being excellent to very good.<br /><br />This is not an action film in the Armageddon sense of the word, but is very visceral and believable for those who do not need over-the-top explosions and meatheaded one-liners to get their action fix. The characters face and make difficult choices that are clearly worthy subjects past the simple \\"let's save the Earth!\\"a bit.

0810945797|5.0|Brian Froud, the creator of the Dark Crystal, is a Genius.    This book is a small Bible.    Well written, and with images so refined it makes you wonder if it is all \\"human\\" made.    All your questions about the Dark Crystal will be answered.  The information contained in the book seems almost sacred,   as for the capacity for the human mind to understand it all,  that is yet to be proven...

B000WS4QJG|5.0|It's not just the improved clarity on the reissue that makes this a must to own, it's how the bonus track collaborations with Fergie and others show clearly that 1980's Michael Jackson would rule over today's stars as well.  These Anniversary releases allow us to revisit a beautiful work of art - in this case the album of the 80s by the King of Pop.  It's a shame that musical genius must be one misstep from insanity, Jackson just another example of one who soared with eagles before crashing into the cliffside like Wile E. Coyote on an Acme rocket.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these for when I walk the dog or (I am still trying to convince myself) go for a jog.  They stay put in the ear, are comfortable, but don't block out external noise, which is exactly what I wanted.  I can hear any approaching vehicles on my country roads (and hold the dog so he doesn't chase them). Would buy again.

0312117337|5.0|This is my fifth purchase of a deck of the infamous TAROT. It's already my favorite. It doesn't conform to the usual four reigning families but it needn't. These are not fortune telling cards; they are meditational tools for those dealing with the Nowness of being. The illustrations are breaktakingly gorgeous on some while others -even negative cards like 'laziness'- reflect a quirky cartoon charm. This is a warm deck of cards where an student of the Buddha or just the  spiritually curious can look at different aspects of their lives with new sharpness and intensity.
B0015HS5TA|4.0|Bharat Nalluri's \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" is a fluffy romantic fairy tale with just enough grounding in harsh reality to make it memorable. The screenplay by David Magee and Simon Beaufoy presents Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances McDormand), a hapless London domestic who has just lost her umpteenth position as a governess and has been branded unemployable. Penniless and starving, she commits a slight, forgivable act of skulduggery to wangle her way into a job as \\"social secretary\\" for wide-eyed starlet Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams). Within minutes Miss Pettigrew discovers that being Delysia's social secretary consists largely of making sure Delysia's various lovers never enter the bedroom simultaneously. There are further entanglements involving Joe Blumfield (Ciaran Hinds), a likable fashion designer to whom Miss Pettigrew is drawn, and the catty Edythe Dubarry (Shirley Henderson), who knows Miss Pettigrew's secret and isn't above revealing it to claim Joe as her personal property.<br /><br />\\"Miss Pettigrew\\" is an enjoyable little fable about the triumph of true love and the possibility of a life turning around in one day. It's a treat to look at, thanks to the elegant photography of John de Borman and the opulent Art Deco stylings of production designer Sarah Greenwood and costume designer Michael O'Connor. All of the above-mentioned actors are perfect, as are Lee Pace, as the impoverished, just-out-of-jail pianist who is Delysia's true love, and Tom Payne as a Bertie-Woosterish playboy. The film's master stroke, however, is its setting on the verge of World War II. Not only does it bring home the movie's \\"Carpe Diem\\" message, but it also adds depth to the character of Miss Pettigrew, who remembers World War I all too well. Without revealing too much of the plot, Miss Pettigrew lost a great deal in the first war, and at one point she surveys the high-society fools around her, bent on throwing away true happiness for a moment's material gain, with withering contempt. It's that look--which McDormand gives with her usual, extraordinary expertise--that raises \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" above the status of pleasant forgettability. \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" makes an interesting and likable antidote to \\"Atonement,\\" that far greater, far sadder and far more dispiriting film about thwarted love during World War II.t's that look--which McDormand gives with her usual, extraordinary expertise--that raises \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" above the status of pleasant forgettability. \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" makes an interesting and likable antidote to \\"Atonement,\\" that far greater, far sadder and far more dispiriting film about thwarted love during World War II.
B00002817D|5.0|Wallace Collection had a major international hit with Daydream, a moody \\"Hey Jude\\" type number.  Their follow-up, Serenade, was perhaps too much of the same to make an impact. Unlike their contemporaries like Shocking Blue, Golden Earring, Sandy Coast, Outsiders, RoDys, the Motions, Earth & Fire, Tee Set among others, their two LPs did not make much of an impact outside their home country - more's the pity.  Inspired pop like Dear Beloved Secretary, Ragtime Lily and Fly Me To The Earth co-exist along side inspired rockers like Get That Girl.  This band ranks in my top 25 of all-time pop favorites.  Accomplished musicians writing light but entertaining songs that still seem fresh today.  Highly recommended.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I saw this movie twice while playing at the theaters and could not wait to purchase it on DVD. My best friend and I laughed and cried and really loved Gerard Butler in this part as well of the rest of the great casts' and funny and touching performances. Another friend saw it too and told the story about overhearing a 20ish male sitting behind her complaining to his girlfriend before the movie started about it being a \\"chick flick\\" which my friend overheard and commented back \\"yeah I guess it probably is a chick flick\\" At the end of the movie though, the 20ish male leaned forward and said to my friend \\"That was a great chick flick.\\"
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Ever since I heard that the Complete scores were going to be released I couldn't wait for the Return of the King. I fell in love with this movie ever since I saw it on the big screen and could never get it out of my head. Howard Shore is a genious and I don't know anyone else who could have done what he did with this music. All of my favorite music moments are on these cd's and I find myself listening to it over and over again. I place the cd's in my player and close my eyes and I can follow the movie cue by cue. Worth the money and worth the time.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|Across the Universe just made those timeless Beatles songs that much better.  I loved the remake of With a Little Help from my Friends with the Joe Cocker version blended into the end.  It's just a great movie with great music.  I highly recommend this to Beatles aficionados.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Definitely one of the best Metal albums of all time, and I mean it... Dave Mustaine wrote the book on how to make Metal and Thrash in particular into something more. In fact, without Dave Mustaine 99.9999999999% of metal as we know it... would SUCK! By far one of the best and most respected (and still not enough) guitar players in the metal community. Definitely one of my biggest influences as a guitar player. Out of the Remastered MEGADETH albums this one was the one that actually turned out better than the original. Dave Mustaine is the MAN!!!
B00005JMXX|4.0|Here we are with another love it or hate it film. \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" was done by the same crew who brought you \\"Independence Day\\".      Well, it's July 5th, and all h**l is breaking loose.  It all starts with the Larsen \\"B\\" ice shelf breaking up and falling into the Ocean (which was a real event, I might add). What happens from here, is best described as pure fiction (Science Fiction?).    Baseball-size hail in Japan, snow in India, tornadoes in Los Angeles, Helicopters freezing in flight above Scotland and a 100+feet storm surge in Manhattan. I think the only thing missing was fish and frogs raining from the sky in Kansas! All this leads up to three \\"superstorms\\" that signal the beginning of the new Ice Age.    Much time is given in the film to it's actors explaining away these occurrences, with Dennis Quaid leading the charge to think proactively, to protect the citizenry of the U.S. (it seems our government is only interested in money-WOW! big surprise, there!) The dramatization of the characters seems superfluous at times, with dialog that's just banal enough to put one to sleep. All the actors in this film make brave attempts to lend credibility to the story, but just can't get past the weather, which is the real star of this film.    The crazy weather IS interesting, though, especially when the choppers froze in mid air. The guy flash-freezing at the hatch of his helicopter is pretty good, and where better than Los Angeles, to get the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" treatment! Manhattan always seems to get the brunt of damage in disaster flicks, and one wonders why it's still standing!    It might seem that I'm bashing this film. On the contrary, there IS one thing that saves this film, and it happens to be my favorite part. It's when the \\"new\\" President of what's left of The United States gets in front of TV cameras and microphones, and ADMITS his fault in the handling of the disaster! I love it!!    The Scientific Community essentially dismissed this film outright, because of it's most glaring errors- The weather. Some said it was an \\"overly severe\\" example of the coming of the next Ice Age. Some even went so far as to say that many of the anomalies would not even occur! While I'm no scientist or meteorologist, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is a pretty good example of \\"Escapist Reality\\"!    Some of the extras are interesting. There is a breakdown of the sound elements of a specific scene in the film, the usual deleted scenes, and commentary tracks. The Making-of segment is accessed by DVD-ROM.
078322737X|5.0|This movie was created well before my time, but still held up when I was in my last semester of high school.  The whole film helped me to decide whether or not I should stay home for college.  I chose in the vain of Richard Dreyfus, and have never looked back.  High school is great then, but after it's over, how long can it last?  The answer is:  only the summer after graduation.  People have to grow and move on.  That's what this film has taught me about my life and hopefully someone else's, too.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The BBC hit one out of the ballpark with \\"Planet Earth\\" on HD DVD!    From the very first scene, you will know that this is no ordinary nature documentary. The production value and quality of the content and narration is very high, which makes it a good documentary on any video format, but the spectacular video quality and cinematography make for a fantastic combination that has no current equal!    Most nature documentary footage intended to show off HD is limited in its appeal because it usually consists of slow pans across vivid flowers, landscapes, or other such material. While pretty to look at, there is nothing more. Here, you get live action photography that seems to take advantage of all the great features of HDTV, and a compelling documentary to back it up.    If you plan on keeping your HD DVD player, you should purchase this box set. It alone justifies the presence of an HD player of any format in your system. I would expect the Blu-ray version to be equal in quality, so if you already have a Blu-ray player or are planning to get one, that's the version to get.    If you are capable of appreciating great visuals and an interesting story across a wide array of topics relating to nature, the environment, and the organisms and landscapes that make up the world we live in, this is an excellent buy!

If you're a true fan of Hitchcock, you'll enjoy this.

0688145078|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a friend's 2 year old who was about to become a big brother.  It is probably age appropriate for a 3-4 year old.  The simple story line is very positive and reviews what it will be like when baby comes home, and what babies do and need.  Helpful preparation for a young sibling to know what to expect with the new member of the family.  Cute book.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I purchased this series due to curiosity.  I had seen clips of this movie on a music video and was intrigued by the faces of the two principle characters.  I went online, researched it, purchased it and never looked back.  It is a breath taking, intriguing series that you want to see all the way through to the end.  If you are a Jane Austen fan, then you will enjoy North and South. If Pride & Prejudice was your favorite, you may want to make room for this one!  Margaret and Thorton's journey is one of discovery I would say.    The actors who portrait these caracters are brilliant and believable.    I was sad to see it end.  It's a purchase you will not regret!
B00005ASOI|5.0|After years of reading great reviews about Suspiria I just had to give in an see what the buzz was about. This film is a work by famed Italian film producer/director/screenwriter Dario Argento and seems to be considered his best or most known work. This guy is pretty much a hero in the horror community. It was his first work where he took a step into the side of the supernatural as part of a trilogy being followed by Inferno & The Mother of Tears. Luckily all the buzz I read was correct because this film was something else.<br /><br />Throughout the film Dario Argento uses lighting to capture the pure elements of horror. It just gives you a very uneasy feeling. This film is far beyond the typical horror you will find out there today. If you put this one up against todays films there really is no contest. It does move a little slow at times and does jump from scene to scene at certain points but not nearly enough to give it a bad rating. I thought it was great and would recommend it to any horror fan. It plays more on your mind then almost anything I've seen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|That's a bold statement, to be sure, but I have no problem standing by it.  The characters, the setting, the stories, the storytelling, the music... It's all fantastically done.      Although the generally used \\"Sci Fi Western\\" tag may seem a bit unusual, don't let it scare you away.  The crew of the ship is the focus, and they're so darn likable that it doesn't even matter where the show takes place.  Fortunately for us, the setting allows for some really cool action and intriguing sites.    If you listen to some of the audio commentaries, you can see just how much heart everyone put into this.  It shows on screen, and you'd be hard-pressed to find another ensemble cast with this much natural chemistry.  By the end of the first disc you should have a decent understanding of who these people are.  By the end of the last disc, you'll have a hard time seeing them go (hurrah for the Serenity movie picking up where this leaves off).       Honestly, I don't even like TV, but I loved this so much that I decided to buy the complete Buffy series on a whim (Joss Whedon's more well-known project).  That's pretty bold, too...

B0013FDM7E|3.0|The film looks beautiful.  The NY landscape is absolutely amazing.  Smith is actually perfect in this film.  This perfomance is, I think, his best. But, this is no action-packed, thrill-a-minute movie.  In fact is is sometimes dull and really quite depressing.  In fact, I think the film lets smith down as it becomes a bit clunky as it goes on.  Otherwise, he would have been considered award worthy.  And that german shepherd - wow!
B000002UB3|5.0|From the first cut, \\"Come Together,\\" to the last, \\"Her Majesty,\\" this is filled with songs, by turn, that are quirky, musical, emotional, amusing. . . . This is a classic \\"Late Beatles\\" album, even as the group was falling to pieces. There is a maturity to this work that belies their relative youth.<br /><br />\\"Come Together\\" starts this album off in fine style.  Nice guitar work is manifest here. This is followed by George Harrison's \\"Something,\\" starting off with distinctive and enjoyable guitar work. A couple key lines:<br /><br />\\"You're asking me will my love go?<br />I don't know, I don't know.\\"<br /><br />Then, the wild and weird \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer.\\"  A couple lines indicate why I choose those words:<br /><br />\\"But as she's getting ready to go,<br />Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer cam down on her head.<br />Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure she was dead.\\"<br /><br />Yikes!  What an ending to her putative date with Maxwell!<br /><br />\\"Here Comes the Sun\\" has a more pleasing sensibility and follows.  A wonderful song. . . .<br /><br />After that comes a series of songs interlinked with one another.  Let's look at a couple to illustrate.  \\"Mean Mister Mustard\\" segues into \\"Polythene Pam.\\"<br /><br />\\"You should see Polythene Pam,<br />She's good looking but she looks just like a man.\\"<br /><br />And on it goes.  To close, there is a brief, amusing ditty, \\"Her Majesty.\\"<br /><br />\\"Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,<br />But she doesn't have a lot to say.<br />. . . .<br />Someday I'm gonna make her mine.\\"<br /><br />And so ends this wonderful masterpiece from the Beatles' body of work.

B000850IHW|5.0|As my name implies: I was buying vinyl albums when Gentle Giant was having their heyday.  I was/am a HUGE fan of Progressive rock but somehow or another I missed these guys.  Well one of the benefits of being older is that I make more money than I did when I was 15; so, I was surfing around Amazon and stumbled on the reviews of Gentle Giant and I've been giving 'em a try.  Man-oh-man what a delight!!!  \\"Free Hand\\" is original,  quirky, complex and really, really good!  It's a great place to start if you're just trying them out.  The 35th Edition is a great audio presentation and I highly recommend it.
B0010358D0|5.0|My only beef with this was the \\"hand of god\\" scene in the end that reminded me too much of Matrix Revolutions.    That being said this is still a FANTASTIC adventure!    The story telling is done superbly.     The relationship between Briareos and Deunan is fleshed out very nicely.     The inner conflict that Briareos has between his humanity and cyborg chassis is played out very well as an external conflict with his genetic equal.     There is a lot of good to say about this film.   1) High action (you would expect from a John Woo film).  2) Close attention to details that make the world believable.  3) Story telling that compels you to watch.  4) High production quality.  5) And, a solid love story that displays integrity and loyalty for one partner. (Who could blame Deunan if she fell for Briareos's bioroid? But in the end she stayed true to what is left of the man she loves... that is a fine display of how relationships should be.)    The animation and overall production quality is even higher than the first of these done in 2004. I have to admit, I didn't realize the production quality could get better until I saw this one.    The characters have lost a bit of their \\"traditional anime\\" look but it really is an improvement.      I can't wait for the next installment of the \\"Appleseed Saga\\".
0143038583|5.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is this: what to eat and what not to eat.  Sounds easy, but as Michael Pollan shows this dilemma is at the heart of what both divides and joins people at the most visceral level.  The dilemma is sharp because the question of what to eat and what not to eat is moral as well as nutritional.  It is practical as well as esthetic.  It is a question that engages all people in all cultures.  It pits traditional values against modernity. There is the family that eats together a meal prepared by a family member or members, and the meal that is eaten on the run prepared by agribusiness and heated in a microwave.  There is fast food and the Slow Food movement.  There is the question of whether to eat meat or not, and if not, whether to be a vegetarian or a vegan or something in-between.  And if we do eat meat, should a distinction be made between free range flesh and the factory kind?  Should the suffering of animals spoil our appetite? We are omnivores, but in a world of so many of us, can we really continue to eat so high on the hog?<br /><br />Pollan addresses these questions and many others in a courageous and uncompromising way that should gain the respect of all readers, whether they agree with his conclusions or not.<br /><br />The book is in three parts, with four characteristic meals.<br /><br />Pollan begins with \\"Industrial Corn\\" (Part I) and a fast food meal from McDonald's in the car.  This part of the book, which could be an entire book itself--and a very good one--tells the story of corn and how it has come to dominate the American food industry.  Eating at McDonald's is appropriate since their menu is dominated by products made from corn including the beef in the burgers which comes from cows fattened on corn, the corn sugar in the sodas and shakes, and the corn oil in the sauces.  Eating while driving at 65 MPH is also apt since the car is running partially on ethanol made from corn.<br /><br />Part II, \\"Pastoral Grass\\" is about range cattle and how ruminants turn the grass that we cannot digest into flesh that we can.  It is also about the wholesale slaughter of animals in deplorable and disgusting conditions, and how these practices have redirected many people to food from sustainable and humane farming practices.  Pollan gets his hands dirty and bloodied as he spends a week on a farm in Virginia harvesting and slaughtering chickens and learning how \\"grass farmers\\" work.  There are two meals in this part of the book, one an organic industrial meal (from Whole Foods) and the other a grass-fed meal from Joel Salatin's Virginia farm.<br /><br />In Part III Pollan shoots a pig, forages for mushrooms and cooks a meal for ten from (mostly) products that he himself gathered, hunted or grew in his garden.  He calls it his \\"perfect meal.\\"  He takes a turn at being a vegetarian and faces head-on the ethical dilemma of eating animals.  He makes three strong arguments that allow him to go on eating meat.  First, there is the argument of the flexitarian, that eating food is a social and cultural event that is shared with family and friends and serves as a basis for bridging cultural divides.  Pollan writes, \\"What troubles me most about my vegetarianism is the subtle way it alienates me from other people and, odd as this might sound, from a whole dimension of human experience.\\"  He adds, \\"I'm inclined to agree with the French, who gaze upon any personal dietary prohibition as bad manners.\\" (pp. 313-314)<br /><br />Next there is the argument from evolutionary biology.  \\"To think of domestication as a form of slavery or even exploitation is to misconstrue...[the relationship between domestic animals and humans; it is] to project a human idea of power onto what is in fact an example of mutualism or symbiosis between species.\\"  Pollan explains, \\"Domestication is an evolutionary, rather than a political, development.  It is certainly not a regime humans somehow imposed on animals some ten thousand years ago.  Rather, domestication took place when a handful of especially opportunistic species discovered, through Darwinian trial and error, that they were more likely to survive and prosper in an alliance with humans than on their own.\\"  A chicken raised on a farm where it is allowed to roam free and then come to a quick and humane end is probably better off than a chicken living in a jungle or forest where its life may be shorter and more difficult.<br /><br />Finally, Pollan argues that while it is the individual in human society that is the basis of moral consideration, in nature it is the species itself.  He asks, \\"Is the individual the crucial moral entity in nature as we've decided it should be in human society?  We simply may require a different set of ethics to guide our dealings with the natural world...(where sentience counts for little)....\\" (p. 325)<br /><br />Pollan also confronts the food industry head on.  He writes that the industrial factory farm is a place \\"where the subtleties of moral philosophy and animal cognition mean less than nothing, indeed where everything we've learned about animals at least since Darwin has been simply...put aside.  To visit a modern Confined Animal Feeding Operation...is to enter a world...[where animals] are treated as machines--\\"production units\\"--incapable of feeling pain.\\" (p. 317)<br /><br />On next page he adds, \\"The industrial animal factory offers a nightmarish glimpse of what capitalism is capable of in the absence of any moral or regulatory constraint whatsoever.\\"<br /><br />What Pollan confronts in this fully lived, deeply researched, and beautifully written tour de force is what is perhaps the deepest existential contradiction of life, namely that in order to live we must eat the bodies of other living things.  Only fruits and nectars are given freely to us, and man cannot live on fruits and nectars alone.pecially opportunistic species discovered, through Darwinian trial and error, that they were more likely to survive and prosper in an alliance with humans than on their own.\\"  A chicken raised on a farm where it is allowed to roam free and then come to a quick and humane end is probably better off than a chicken living in a jungle or forest where its life may be shorter and more difficult.

B0010358CG|4.0|Animation - Prior to Ex Machina, the previous Appleseed anime (2004) was the best Appleseed anime yet.  Unfortunately it suffered from awkward animation.  The motion capture CG looked nice until the characters began moving around.  Ex Machina fixes that for the most part.  The movements are almost as smooth as those in FFVII Advent Children.  There are still some awkward movements in this film, but only on a couple of minor parts.  John Woo's influence can be seen in the fight sequences, as well as some Matrix-type moments, but they aren't overdone.  If you are an old school John Woo fan, you'll like the small touches (doves!)...brings back memories of \\"The Killer.\\"      Character design - The characters are very well designed and still retain an anime feel to them, not being made too realistic.  Deunan's design has changed a bit from the \\"orthodox\\" look, which 2004 had kept.  She has a younger and softer appearance, but it's not bad.  I like how they gave a lot of focus on Briareos, especially on his cyborg body.  His body seems more human-like like in the manga.  This is especially emphasized in his combat with other characters and his clothing.  I noticed his eyes were a different color from the 2004 anime, but that's fine...he's a cyborg; it shouldn't difficult to change the color of his \\"eyes.\\"  Other characters, such as Hitomi, are also done very well.  The outfits, overall, were very nice.      Story elements - The story is very good.  The two main elements are: 1) relational, between Deunan and Briareos, and 2) conflict, against an antagonist who threatens the genetically-altered peace (Bioroid led world).  The relational theme is the most well done, and runs throughout the movie, bringing in a new character to help it along.  More history was given about the relationship b/n Deunan and Briareos, and explained their love for one another, which was kind of ambiguous in the past.  Briareos's character is deeper in Ex Machina, which I really appreciated.  Theyalso did a good job of tying it in with the world crisis theme, which actually seemed to be there just to support the relational theme.  The world crisis theme was not as deep or developed, and seems to end somewhat abruptly, which is why I feel like it was just a support for the relational theme.      Overall, this is a great anime.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in Appleseed.
B000BCE918|5.0|This is definitely a collector's item, especially for Dinosaur fans, large or small! Great value for money.
0143143492|5.0|This is more of a textbook or series of thought provoking considerations, not something to just read through and be done with.  Not everyone will be at the stage of their life to slow down enough and consider life's meaning, but if they are ready and mature enough to delve into this deep subject, then this book is worth the read.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This movie seems to be very under-rated considering that it is one of Robin Williams' best performance.    An outstanding cast comes together in this movie. Each character is interesting and in my opinion the acting was should have been recognized at the Academy Awards.    What Dreams May Come did take the Academy Award (1998) for Visual Effects.  You will see why in the first half hour of the movie and it only gets better.    Music: The late great Michal Kamen (April 15, 1948 - November 18, 2003)  did his usual fantastic job. His music is a perfect compliment to the acting and the visuals.    Concept: A very nice concept of what happens after life. It really does  end up showing us a bit of heaven.    This is a movie that will take you from sad to joy, so be prepared.    5-Stars
0439813786|5.0|The Inventions of Hugo Cabret<br />By Brian Selznick<br />A Masterpiece!<br />This book is a masterpiece of art and words.<br />It has been a long time since a book has touched me like this one.<br />I usually read until I fall asleep.  This book kept me awake, until I finished.<br /><br />Hugo Cabret is a twelve-years-old boy, with the whole world on his shoulders. He has no parents, no school, no money, no friends but he does have huge dreams.  He works hard to keep all the clocks running in the Paris train station.  This is a big and important job, for a boy.  The clocks keep the whole city of Paris running as it should.  This story is woven with the loss of Hugo's father, and the lives of a toy maker, and his goddaughter. It also tells of Hugo's determination to save a magical machine that may contain a secret message from his father.<br /><br />If you pick up a book with 540 pages, it can seem a little overwhelming.  When you see that half of the pages are filled with cleaver, detailed drawings, the book becomes much more fascinating.  The details in Brian Selznick's book are so clever. The pictures make the story run as it should; telling Hugo Cabret's story in a way that mere words could not achieve.<br /><br />I am even more fascinated with Hugo and his clocks, because my father and grandfather were watchmakers.  I used to watch my father take apart a watch or clock, fix and clean it and put it back together with his intricate parts and small tools.<br /><br />I think adults and children of all ages will love this book.<br /><br />Jill Ammon Vanderwood, Author<br />[[ASIN:142591098X Through the Rug]]<br />[[ASIN:0979845548 Through The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)]]

B000055ZDT|5.0|Dopethrone should be held high as the pinnacle of stoner-doom. It's one of those albums that many,many bands will try to surpass and come no where close to the actual thing. Now, I know there's some critics of Electric Wizard and stoner doom in general that say that these guys are nothing more than Sabbath rip-offs. Well, I personally think it shouldn't matter. These guys are taking a style that has been done before and adding their own touch to it, so who cares if Electric Wizard sounds like Sabbath, as long as you can tell the difference between Electric Wizard, Black Sabbath, Bongzilla, Yob, Weedeater etc. it doesn't matter.     With this album, Electric Wizard have taken stoner-metal and given it a much,much heavier tone than most bands of the genre are willing to do. Everything sounds like it's being run through fuzz distortion, even the vocals. Actually, I'd like to address the production on this record. In this world, there are tons and tons of albums that suffer from muddy, raw, unpolished production and never realize their full potential because of it. I am happy to say that Dopethrone is one of those few albums where gritty,dirty production is actually a plus, rather than taking away from the experience. The bass frequencies are put up in the mix, causing your speakers to rumble and shake in terror. At loud volumes  you can feel the bass pulse through the room. The guitars are sludgy and distorted and extremely fuzzed out and create kind of a cloudy feeling, making the rest of the band sound like they're pushing through the fog (which was probably intended, based on the album cover). Occasionally the guitar will be run through some kind of effect,like delays and flangers, to give the album a psychedelic quality. The drums seem a little buried, but again it helps retain it's foggy feel. The vocals are distorted, which makes the lyrics hard to understand, and again they're given less attention than the bass and guitar, making it sound like a man buried and calling for help. The album runs together almost as one piece, with few breaks in between, giving the whole procession an oppressive feel. The songs are all groovy, longrunning jams, with instrumental parts,improvisation, and samples all figuring into the equation. There also is quite a bit of repetition and occasional tension building throughout most of the tracks, giving it a pleasing hypnotic feel. All in all the tracks are of consistent quality and rarely let up, and when it does, it's always to build up into another pot-fuelled riff session. Again, this album is pretty much everything Stoner Metal should be. If you're a black sabbath fan there's definitely something here for you or if you're first getting into stoner metal you'll do yourself a great favor by picking this up. If you're a huge doom and/or stoner metal fan you should probably have this by now. For fans of Eyehategod,Down, Weedeater, Goatsnake etc.
038073186X|5.0|Dennis Lehane's Shutter Island was one of the best suspense, thriller stories I've ever read . . . every spare moment was spent in reading this book until finished. The ending was so surprising and so abrupt that I had to turn the page back to make sure I read it right!<br /><br />Can't believe those readers who have called this book boring . . . it's everything but that. It's a great read and you won't be disappointed. In my opinion, this is Lehane's best book, though I liked Mystic River tremendously.<br /><br />I'm very excited that the book will be made into a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Scorsese (same pairing as in The Departed) . . . now if I can only wait until October 2009 when the film is scheduled to be shown!

0143038583|4.0|I've yet to finish Michael Pollan's latest, but I fully intend to.  I find it the type of book that requires some \\"time off\\" before getting back to finishing it.  It's chock full of neat stuff, but sometimes the prose bogs down and so does this reader's brain. I have not picked it up for a week, but I want to get back to it soon....with that said, this book is a must for serious foodies...if just to have in your library for when the whim hits to pick it up and read a chapter or two...Michael Pollan is a wonderful scholar and writer...and heck! he knows Alice Waters!!
B000002JPA|4.0|I think this album was very good but the band was still looking for their refined sound. Pull me under was one that was successful when compared to later albums. I always felt it sounded much like Rush, Queensryche, Pink Floyd, with Kansas and Queen all rolled into a group with a few members of Dream Theater mixed in.
B0013FBS20|5.0|Another excellent Will Smith movie. The only thing I would complain about is the ending. The blu-ray version is a great picture and sound smorgesboard. It has an different ending that is a little better than the theatrical version.

B000002LPD|5.0|In 1991 rock & roll was about to undergo a massive turnaround, gone would be hair-metal, which ooozed out California sunshine and sex while letting us know we did'nt need anything but a good time and keeping us entertained for the better part of a decade. In would be the meloncholy sounds of grunge, which hammered despair and nothingness as if to pound a hypothetic nail in the coffin of pop-metal. Looking back at the early 1990's from a 2008 point of view I have absolutely no idea why or how grunge killed pop-metal? I mean come on who wants despair and a glance at everyday life when you can stand up and shout to the sounds of Girls, Girls, Girls? By this time in 1991 most hair-metal bands had seen their flame start to fizzle, bands like Poison, Motley Crue, Cinderella and Def Leppard had ruled the relms of Mtv for the last decade and now a new generation was ready to sweep the old aside and bring in the new, well hold on just a minute cause in early 1991 when all seemed lost for 80's metal fans, here came Van Halen slamming onto the charts like nobody's business. \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" was Van Halen's ninth album and in my mind is their third best with Sammy Hagar, following 5150 and Balance. For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, was also a reckoning of sorts for the band, they dropped the over the top synth rock of the first 2 Sammy albums for a more straight ahead rock sound, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge also has some of the most memorable Van Halen tunes that the guys ever churned out.<br /><br />1. Poundcake 10-10  Van Halen starts For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge off with an arena rock anthem, complete with Eddie motoring a drill up the neck of his guitar, catchy lyrics and sing along chorus.<br /><br />2. Judgement Day 10-10  Good solid rocker that keeps the pace of the album flowing, catchy chorus and good lyrics by Hagar, I think most people underestimate Sammy's ability to write clever songs.<br /><br />3.  Spanked 10-10  This song is pretty impressing, this is probably why most people don't respect Hagar the song writer, because of the really cheesy lyrics and chorus, but Eddie plays a rocking riff, and this song gets in your head and stays forever. It almost reminds you of some S&M song you'd hear on a porn...All you bad bad boys...call her up on the spank line!!<br /><br />4.  Runaround 10-10  Runaround is one of my favorite Van Halen songs ever, its one of the first tracks I liked from the band, it has an amazing catchy chorus and the riff and solo from Eddie is totally wailin'.<br /><br />5. Pleasure Dome 8-10  Interesting song here, I have heard this song pertains to masturbation, I myself cannot validate those claims, but listening to the lyrics one could not find it to hard to assimalate the two. Good song though just kinda long for my taste.<br /><br />6. In 'n' Out 10-10  This song sort of lays the groundwork for a sexxed up party tune, but I think maybe the guys were going for something a little different here than just another romp in the hay song, good track though.<br /><br />7. Man On A Mission 10-10  My absolute favorite track off the album, this song is pretty generic late 80's early 90's rock song, but I love it anyway, really catchy and Eddie just kills this riff with an awesome solo just to ice the cake.<br /><br />8. The Dream Is Over 10-10  Another very catchy rock and roll song here from the guys, and another faavorite of mine the chorus gets stuck in your head and man it takes forever to get out.<br /><br />9. Right Now 10-10  Well here it is the big hit off the record, and surprisingly its a piano driven power ballad of sorts. This is the song everyone notifies with For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, and for good reason its an awesome song. I also think this song was used in some cola commercials back in the early 90's.<br /><br />10. 316 10-10  Anyone who has ever read one of my reviews knows I do not particularly like instrumentals, but this is sort of a guitar lullaby to Eddies son Wolfgang, its ok.<br /><br />11.  Top Of The World 10-10 The last song on the album is another single, and was pretty big on rock radio as well, really catchy and had a kickin' video to boot. great great song.<br /><br />For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, maybe not Van Halen's finest work with Sammy Hagar, but its a great listen and is probably right beside 5150 and just below Balance. Eddie's guitar work is top notch as usual, I mean what would you expect from the man most rockers consider ZEUS of the six string, and Alex's drumming is one of a kind, nobody pounds the skins like AVH, and last but not least Michael Anthony the un-hearalded one of the band plays his bass like somebody told him his life depended on it, and his backing vocals are always a contributing factor to Van Halen's sound. If you've lived under a rock the last 17 years and have not heard anything off this record go buy it right now, if your already a Van Halen fan, well, then I am just preaching to the choir.gle, and was pretty big on rock radio as well, really catchy and had a kickin' video to boot. great great song.

B00003CXTG|5.0|I don't understand why people trash this movie, If you want to experience the horror of that fateful day, then watch this, my Grandfather who died in 2006, at 84,  told me that the attack scenes were the most realistic scenes he had seen in a film about Pearl Harbor, he was there & said that the attack scenes were just as he remembered them, he did however have issues with Ben Affleck & Josh Hartnett flying in planes with shirts without breathing gear, that he said would not have been possible because of air altitudes, At first I did'nt like this film, but listening to him talk about it got me interested in watching it again, & I must say this film captures the Pearl Harbor attack the same way \\"Titanic\\" captures that fateful ship's demise, yes, Hollywood may up the ante for entertainment sake, but any smart viewer gets the general idea, Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR is faithful at best, it is clear he watched old footage of FDR to study his mannerism, & Ben Affleck is good in this too, why people pick at him is beyond me, Kate Beckinsale is also good as his love interest, I don't think it is fair to compare them to Kate & Leo from \\"Titanic, however this film works & the special features make you realize that Michael Bay & Jerry Bruckheimer was intent on making a realistic film, so much they consulted survivors of that fateful day for accuracy, my grandfather lived it & liked this film a lot, if it was good enough for him, then it is good enough for me to appreciate the sacrifices that many gave their lives for to their country.
006135323X|5.0|I almost did not buy this book as I sought to explore the new literature on behavioral and cognitive science.  The negative review are too negative.  You get from this book what you bring to it in open mindedness, in my opinion.<br /><br />My truth-teller, off-setting the reality that this is a double-spaced book that inflates 120 pages of thought into 240 pages of easy to digest presentation, is the author's unique provision in the end-notes of both direct references to seminal works that each chapter is based on, with additional references suggested, AND his recognition of 17 collaborators, each with a long paragraph of biographic information.  This is in short a worthy work, it was worthy of my time, and I do not agree with those who are dismissive or cavalier about this book.<br /><br />As with [[ASIN:0300122233 Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]] and other works of this ilk, they seem to be blessed with an immaculate conception that fails to recognize the work of the 1960's and 1970's (e.g. Herbert Simon, \\"satisficing,\\" but I no longer mark this down--this is a new generation thinking new thoughts, and I have decided it is too much to expect them to go back more than 20 years.<br /><br />The opening of the book is impressive.  The author was burned on 70% of his body by a magnesium flare, and his probing of his own pain and how the nurse's had settled on fast painful ripping off of the bandages (with no medication.<br /><br />Key point early in the book: most people don't know what they want until they see it in context.  This is one reason I am planning an edited work in 2009 on Cultural Intelligence.

B0013527I4|5.0|This is the Muppets DVD I've been waiting all along for.  This one features the episode guest starring Roger Miller, who was a fairly forgetable country singer.  But the running gag of this particular episode is probably the best one that was ever done on the Muppets.  Through most of the episode, the Muppets contract something called Cluckitis and one by one sneeze and turn into chickens.  Kermit is one of the last to transform, but he is definitely the funniest looking chicken of the lot.  In the end, the only ones who aren't chickens are Gonzo (it would be hard to make him look any sillier) and Statler and Waldorf (who turn into DOGS!)  Also on this volume are perhaps the two most legendary country singers in history, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|The first and second seasons of Veronica Mars are beyond compare good. The third season, while still worth the watching, is not as wonderful. This is due to the fact that the shows new network for the third season made them get rid of their whole season mystery story arc and instead do two little story arcs and then for the last few episodes, no story arc or climax at all. Kristen Bell, and the other cast members are still superb, the dialoge witty, the characterization amazing, it's only the stories that don't live up. Oh how I'll miss this show (and Everwood). How can such good television get canceled when crap like One Tree Hill continues to air?

B0011KQSZ4|4.0|\\"With a circus parade of mourning Brits and enough appalling circumstances to set proper Englishness back to the Dark Ages, \\"Death at a Funeral\\" pits decorum against sex, drugs and dysfunction. The winners? Auds who know you laugh hardest when you're not supposed to, and who appreciate the humorous qualities of embarrassment, blackmail and the twitting of the upper classes.\\" John Anderson<br /><br />This is decidedly a British humour film. The distance between pretension and crazy humour is not too far apart.  The upper crust with their stiff upper lips seem to crack a bit. The patriarch of the house has gone and died. His British gentry friends and his family gather to say good-bye. The stoic older son who with his wife have been living in the family stead, is set to bring off this funeral with dignity. The anxiety he feels is palpable and then his younger brother, the famed novelist from the US arrives and upsets his world again. Into the mix arrives his cousin Martha with her fiancee who has unknowingly ingested a hallucinogen and goes mildly mad. The old debilitated uncle arrives via his wheel chair with two friends one gay and one well, just nerdy. And, one of the little people arrives whom it appears has a secret to sell. Needless to say the funeral goes berserk- a naked wild man on the roof, the little person bound and gagged, the minister who must leave urgently and the family dispositions come undone.  It is all serious to the family and guests but to those of us looking on it is a hilarious romp- I found myself laughing out loud through much of the film.<br /><br />The performances were superb. The staid son, Daniel is played by Matthew Macfadyen with perfection. His wife, Keeley Hawes, who wants a promise that they will put a down payment on the promised flat, plays her role with subtlety. The bereaved mother and wife, Jane Asher, wants no one to upstage her. Rupert Graves, the novelist is a supercilious brat. Martha, Daisy Donovan, steals the movie with her ability to be seriously funny while trying to convince her fiancee, Simon, Alan Tudyk to put his clothes on. Martha's father, Victor played by Peter Egan, is the epitome of the English gentry, a snob.<br /><br />As a farce this often goes over the top, but we forgive the writer and director because we have tears rolling down our cheeks from laughter.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-29-08<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FL7CBY Almost Strangers]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000I2J6WI Where Angels Fear to Tread]]be seriously funny while trying to convince her fiancee, Simon, Alan Tudyk to put his clothes on.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|Call Me Irresponsible was bound to hit the charts when Michael Bubl&eacute; released this fine album. Michael's work is outstanding and he easily can match any crooner of the entire twentieth century! The sound quality is excellent and I love that artwork, too!<br /><br />The album starts with Michael singing \\"The Best Is Yet To Come;\\" this number sounds fresh with its big band style arrangement and Michael never sings a superfluous note! Michael's voice is in excellent form and the music complements his vocals perfectly. \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" has a Latin flavor that works wonders for this ballad; and the brass helps the melody along, too. Michael sings this love song with energy and enthusiasm and this truly amazes me! It's a very strong number that Michael easily aces.<br /><br />\\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\" is a fine cover by Michael Bubl&eacute; who sings this passionately with all his heart and soul. His voice is smoother than silk and you'll want to slow dance with your sweetheart to this tune. \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" is a fine duet between Michael and Boyz II Men; they harmonize and sing this number wonderfully! The piano arrangement really shines and this number is easily a major highlight of this CD.<br /><br />\\"Call Me Irresponsible,\\" the title track of this album, places Michael front and center--and he sings this marvelously. The musical arrangement makes good use of the brass and it all works very well. \\"Everything\\" is yet another fine tune that Michael Bubl&eacute; sings to perfection, listen for \\"Everything;\\" it's a beautiful ballad.<br /><br />\\"I've Got The World On A String,\\" a Harold Arlen number, sounds fresh and new--Arlen would be proud! The backup vocalists do a great job and I really like \\"I've Got The World On A String.\\" This number benefits from a fine, brassy musical arrangement. \\"That's Life,\\" a number Frank Sinatra liked to sing, has Michael singing this very well; and it's just as enjoyable as when Frank sang it. The background vocalists are OK; but Michael didn't really need them for this number. I think \\"That's Life\\" would have sounded even better without the background chorus.<br /><br />The album ends with Michael Bubl&eacute; performing \\"Dream.\\" \\"Dream\\" is a classic pop tune that Michael does with heart and soul every step of the way. \\"Dream\\" gets a solid treatment from Michael and it makes a good ending for this album.<br /><br />Michael Bubl&eacute; fans will, naturally, want this in their collections.

No wonder it features in French comic recommendation lists and catalogues.    If you browsed to this page and you don't have this book, you should probably buy it. In my (and others') experience, the book will subsequently travel through your circle of friends because its appeal is universal, making it hard to put down.

0452284392|4.0|This well-written, easy book is a good way to start learning about network theory. It discusses the history, some basics, and the broad application (or presence?) of networks in the world around us.<br />However, it skims only the surface of what the research is all about, and leaves one thirsty for more, making it a good introduction to further studying (in my case, neural networks).<br /><br />The writing style is close to story-telling at times, and this got a bit on my nerves. Apart from that I really cannot say anything bad about this book, I am glad I purchased it.

B0011U8NZ2|1.0|I was there and what a disappointment this concert was! Morrison had recently been busted in Miami and the lizard king was mo more. This concert was not the hearty macho poetic youthful self assertion one associates with Morrison, but an exhibition of drunken self indulgence that failed to impress even my 16 year old self, who was looking to be impressed. It began with an already somewhat drunken Morrison clumsily sauntering onstage with a bottle of brown liquor which he continually quaffed in a swinish manner.  The concert proceded to spiral downward from there. The band tried to hold the show together but there was no stopping Morrison fom his progressive degeneration.  I believe this concert is where my perception of rock heros being driven by tragic character flaws codified. We were young, we were high and we deserved better! I'd be interested in listening to this CD for the sake of recollection and review of my perceptions of the time, but certainly not as nostalgia or enjoyed memories. This concert was the last act before the epilogue: the hero of a greek tragedy after his fall.
0060989157|5.0|This book is a classic. I have read it countless times, and still find it to be one of the best rock autobiographies around. Motley Crue: Iconic, Complex, Tragic. These guys are so human, and that is why I love this book. I personally dislike their music greatly: always did, always will.  However, the four amazing people who talk about themselves in this book are worthy of their status.     Nikki Sixx is the total geek, low self esteem-having, \\"make myself over into an icon\\" leader; Tommy is the comic foil to Nikki's serious tone; the stereotypical drummer: childlike, inarticulate, very physical. Vince is the classic vocalist: brash, self absorbed, but in truth the most sensitive of the members. The perrson I respect the most in the band is definitely Mick Mars: schizophrenic for sure, but he knows the members of the band better than they know themselves. He is the most down to earth, and the least self-pitying.     This book is very enjoyable because these four men are very bit the comic-book characters they portrayed onstage, and unbelievably human, and real in spite of that.

B000E1NWJQ|5.0|I am a brass person by nature, so sorry to all of you woodwind and string players who may find your sections left out of this review.    Simply put, this recording is astounding. The world renowed CSO brass section clearly displays its unmatched power and breadth in this recording. Fritz Reiner also did an excellent job in helping the orchestra render this work so beautifully. The highlight of this recording is the brilliant finale -- Pines of the Appian Way -- where the CSO brass give one of the most incredible performances I have ever heard in my life.    If you are a fan of Respighi and/or brass istruments, this recording is a must have.

006054094X|1.0|It can only be an indictment of our currrent, media-addled culture that anyone would take this book as serious history. Menzies research is so flawed, and his reasoning so ignorant, that a junior high school class should be able to take it apart in an afternoon. If you are inclined to take any of this book as fact, take a quick look at Menzies footnotes. Many of his references are to scientific and historical notes from the 19th century and many of his \\"finds\\" were \\"unfortunatley destroyed before they could be confirmed.\\" Menzies apparently hasn't had much of an education; if he had, he would be embarrassed to make so many claims based on willful ignorance and the last centry or two of effort by real historians and archaeologists. His disgrace is only matched by those who promote its claims.

B0007KS7D0|5.0|I bought this lense in a package that came with both the Raynox DCR-150 and the Raynox DCR-250.  Both lenses are excellent when snapped on the front of my Panasonic FZ8.  Really any camera with a decent zoom should perform well.    Having both the Raynox 150 and 250 allows for some comparison.  To be honest, I like the 150 better.  I use it exclusively when I'm out in nature, the 250 has a much shallower depth of field, and is too hard to use handheld.  The 150 gets a great macro, as you can see if you look at the customer images above, and the depth of field is much more forgiving.  I have had far greater luck using my 150 in real world situations than my 250.    The lense takes a bit of getting used to.  Some people will only shoot on  manual focus, but I find this frustrating.  Most cameras focus fast enough, I know my FZ8 does, and I have no problems at all.  In general you just have to get into the right range (about 6\\" or so), and your camera will focus just fine.    In all I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have a nice super zoom camera like the Panasonic FZ8.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Last scene where Samantha brings Cam (Ben Browder) macaroons in the infirmary, notice the BIG baby bump as she is walking out the door.  How come we never heard of this \\"bump\\" on TMZ?    I am sorry the series ended but glad they did the movie to tie up some loose ends.  Vala is wonderful as the new \\"Smart-A\\" replacing Jack's personality.      Actually, the best part of the whole DVD is to watch one of the features called Stargate at Comic-Con.  An interview in front of the public with Teal'c, Samantha and the producers.  Teal'c is hysterically funny, especially when he does his Randy Jackson impersonation from American Idol.  Samantha joins right in as Paula, and of course, a Simon comment.  After seeing Teal'c stiff as a board for so many years, I nearly died laughing.  He should be a comedian.  Teal'c calls Daniel on his cell phone.... hold on to your cheeks!    Kudos to the crew.  Sorry to see it end.  Shame on you Sci-Fi Channel!
0743496736|3.0|I have read several of Ms Picoult's books. This one was too long, there were times I could skim several pages and not miss anything. The only thing that kept me going was trying to find out why Peter did what he did and why Josie had no self esteem.   Ok so this is probably based on some of the shootings in our schools. My question is why?  What makes a student that upset by bullying? We were all bullied. Is society that much different than it was 30 years ago when I was in high school?   If I could talk to Josie I would tell her that nothing, nothing is worth a friendship.  And those kids were not her friends anyhow.  And that boyfriend? If he hurts you once he will hurt you again.  I don't know why she had such a need to fit in and she knew she was hurting Peter.  She is just as guilty as the other kids in the school; her actions probably hurt Peter more than their outright bullying and being mean.   Who is raising these children? What kind of parent allows violent video games in their homes? Aren't children being monitored as to where, when, why and who they are with?   It is an ok book; but I have read better.
0767836286|3.0|This movie keeps the tension fairly high throughout, but the final half-hour gets unrealistically wacky.  Although the very surprising ending is dramatic and then.. well, you may find it terriboy unsatisfying.  But, I think the whole movie was overdone.  I think the actors acted like they were on steroids, especially Jeff Bridges.  At the end, you see why they had him acting so hyper, but still, it wasn't realistic.  Also, there was more than a whiff of political B.S. -- as you might expect from any movie Tim Robbins is in -- particularly when it comes to painting the FBI as bad guys and the fanatics as right-wingers.  This is one of those movies you'll forget about ten minutes after it ends.
014240165X|4.0|I was looking at combining some of my reading groups with a mixture of high ability students and my reluctant readers, and I came across Stormbreaker and I knew that it was perfect.  What better way to pull in a couple of non-reading boys as well as keep some advanced readers engaged and get hooked on a series?    Stormbreaker may not be the best book out there in regards to character development in regards to its main character of Alex Rider, but it does lay the foundation for a good series.  I anticipate that in the future novels (I am aware that there are many already published) will elaborate more on Alex and develop his character more with each novel.  One aspect of Alex that I enjoy is that he does have the attitude of a typical teenager.  He oftentimes pushes the limits of authority and does what he thinks is best.  He disregards advice on occasion and thinks that he can accomplish things although they are filled with danger.  This, honestly, is true of many teenage boys.  Oftentimes in novels for youngsters, faults are not so easy to see in a main character as they were here.    I do think that the plot of the story was a little weak.  Sayer's terroristic plan was a little far fetched, but even more so was his reasoning for revenge.  But in defense of this flaw, realize that the book is meant for upper elementary and early middleschool students.  Sayer's drive for revenge can easily hit home for many students this age, and therefore will easily wrap up the story in their minds.      All in all, it was an exciting read with a few flaws.  I anticipate reading more of the Alex Rider saga in the future and see how the author delves into the personality of Alex within the series.
0345477618|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the making of Star Wars. The author covers all aspects of the movie and is chock full of paintings, photos, manuscript pages, and poster art.  The story unfolds chronologically and after each chapter the author lists the new elements of each draft of the screenplay as it progresses toward the final version. Lots of great trivia and insight into the epic struggle to make Star Wars.
B00004XONN|4.0|...well it happened in the end didn't it? Radiohead wanted to change their sound and I really don't blame them...they are a really talented bunch of musicians (yes not just Greenwood and Yorke) and I find this change in direction very refreshing...although there are some issues I have with the complainers of this album...    ...\\"Ooh it's just electronic and static noise...how does anyone listen to this?\\" You really need to listen to some real static noise then...bands like Wolf Eyes and Merzbow make their living out of this kind of noise...now spot the diference...what is it? Yes this is melodic and listenable...so please stop complaining...    ...the plus sides of this album I'd have to say is the new use of synths and new instruments...for the most part the electric guitar is left in the cupboard to gather dust as they try synthed voices in the song \\"Kid A\\" mixed with the Xylophone on the keyboard...combining a hypnotic bassline with a brass ensemble in \\"National Anthem\\"...and electronic drums with a synth in the (in)famous \\"Idioteque\\"...these ideas prosper within the album as long as you have an open mind (within reason)...    ...and the downside...well...the problem is it's completely overshadowed...if they started with this as their debut instead of \\"Pablo Honey\\" they probably would have had more prestige success instead of being known as the band that played \\"Creep\\" and annoyed half of the population...but because \\"OK Computer\\" came first the die hard fans will always say it's not good enough and push it aside...    ...my advice? Give this album a chance...it's not as abstract as everyone says it is...merely in contrast to their other albums...and if you don't enjoy it...fine...just don't call it abstract...because it isn't...oh yeah and the rumour that the whole record company lost their christmas bonus after the manager heard this...not true...
B000244FDW|5.0|This is the Masterpiece Theater version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudic, originally aired in '80 or '81. Might be the best ever. A two hour movie version will never ever do the book justice. This version is faithful to the book and wonderful. Beautifully filmed and very well cast. Enjoy!!
1416960953|3.0|My son was a little disappointed because the outside is actually a book cover.  Not as detailed as he thought.  But the pictures and the writings are very pretty and it held his interest for atleast a day which is pretty good for a 7 year old boy.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  Self-indulgent, boring, all in all, an idiotic trifle  Watch something else.
B000UGS97U|5.0|Yeah...just look at it!!! If you like starwars at all, you will just love to see your little ones hugging one of these while you watch the movies together.  It is just so cute you can't help but to pet the thing.
B000J10ER4|5.0|Sci-Fi, Superman, a long time favorite is back. Lex Luthor is insane as usual. The story is great. We are left wondering and hoping for a sequal, with Lois Lain and superbaby.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! I live in Germany so I miss out on the Walmart $5.50 bin and all the discount movies so this was an exceptional purchase. It came in a timely matter and was in pristine condition. Thanks a  bunch!!!
B0011NVC9I|1.0|This movie is not worth the cost of a rental, and we are glad we didn't buy it.  When we heard it was in the works, we were delighted to think this venerable tale would be put on film -- but our disappointment in the treatment of the characters with this cheesy animation and the liberties they took with the original story are simply unacceptable.  The so-called \\"special effects,\\" monsters were simply laughable. Jolie looked hot in her body capture suit, but that wasn't why we rented this awful, awful, film.  We didn't bother watching the final scenes unroll -- by then, the whole thing had become just a huge waste of time.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|Three American brothers (Brody, Wilson and Schwartzman) meet in India to take a train trip aboard the Darjeeling Limited.  Their ostensible purpose is to re-bond after the death of their father, to seek enlightenment and pursue a spiritual journey.  Later, it develops that the ulterior motive for one of the brothers (Owen Wilson) organizing the trip is to connect with their mother (Angelica Huston), who currently lives as a nun in an isolated Indian monastery.      They encounter their mother, who was reluctant to receive them.  Yet, they do not find the closure that they were seeking and that they hoped for.  At the movie's end, they sprint with their luggage to catch their departing train, eventually jumping aboard after tossing their baggage.  Maybe they had baggage they were carrying around about the death of their father and their relationship with their mother.    The movie is flagged as a comedy.  I'm not sure I laughed once in 90 minutes.  It is on the verge of being funny, on the verge of being profound.      Instead, I give it two stars and three NO-DOZ, to help you stay awake while watching it.
B000FA57N0|5.0|As many of you, might already know Blu-ray Disc has won the \\"High Def\\" format war.  That being said, I don't know what Universal Studios Blu-ray Disc plans are other then saying they are going to back Blu-ray Disc.  With that being said, the quality of this HD-DVD is fantastic and that is partly due to Jack Green who was the Cinematographer on such films as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.  The colors and the definition of the video quality is almost painting perfect as well as the sound quality.  Joss Whedon who by the way is the reason I wanted to become a screenwriter and a filmmaker to begin with; wrote a fitting ending to his \\"Browncoats journey\\".  Now, to expand on what I wrote in my title.  Please buy the series Firefly before watching this film.  For a couple of reasons, I watched this film before I watched the series and I have to say, I was very confused about what was going on.  Second, if you watch the series you already have a complete idea of who each character is and what part they play.  Firefly and Serenity a great time even if you are not a Science Fiction fan or a Western fan.
0920668372|1.0|This book has always been disturbing to me.  Talk about not knowing how to let go of your kids.  The mother in this book is, frankly, nuts, and the son needs to get a restraining order against her.        What does his wife think about the fact that his mom sneaks in his room and rocks him in the middle of the night?  Is nobody else disturbed by that image?    And the people who think this book is sweet--I fear for your children and the relationships you will have with them as adults.  Seriously, I understand, as a parent, how you will cherish your relationship with your kids for the rest of your life.  But your relationship HAS to change and mature, otherwise...    Well...you'll be like creepy mom.  (I will give points for the end where the son loves his mom back, that's kinda sweet...but only if you forget about all the mom-stalking during his adult years.)    DO NOT GIVE THIS BOOK TO ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT.  As they used to say about nuclear weapons: NOT HEALTHY FOR CHILDREN AND OTHER LIVING BEINGS.
B000066744|5.0|This is a movie everyone should enjoy. There are enough good reviews here with wonderful explainations of the story, so if those dont help i dont know what will. I'm a big fan of Tim Roth and this is by far his best performance. I also love the piano; there are many wonderful songs here as well. I only wonder if he actually played it himself, it sure looks like it, and if he did it would be that much more impressive. Trust me and the rest of these reviews and GET THIS MOVIE!!
B00003CX8N|5.0|I loved the film, love Bancroft and Sir Anthony and Dame Judi, love what the reviewers have said about this marvelous little film.  But I will add that if you love the time period (the setting begins in 1949), you will appreciate that set after set is tirelessly and lovingly dressed with the details of the late '40's through the '50's to the '60's.  The costuming alone could be praised, and I generally don't focus on fashion in films. Backgrounds, even if they appear briefly, were carefully created to transport us back in time, just as we are transported into the separate worlds and lives of these two correspondents.  Brilliantly done.
B000084HAJ|5.0|This is the most incredible piece of classical music that I own or have ever seen or heard.  I've spent more than 25 years of my life searching for this heavenly music and have found my salvation in this performance.  While the video covers most of the actual concert, the audio performance is a personal treasure.  I have both the DVD and CD.  Buy it from Amazon, rent it from Blockbuster, or borrow it from a friend, but you must see this peformance before you pass from this life.  It is truely one of the great wonders of the classical world.
B0013N8VWW|1.0|Bryan Adams has been around for 28 years, sold millions of albums, and is now 48 years of age. He's managed to stay around for almost 30 years while others have faded away. He's managed to remain a celebrity enigma as well, since I can't think in all of these years too many interviews with him, nor interviews revealing much about himself.<br /><br />\\"11\\" is his eleventh studio album in 28 years, but I have many issues to take Mr. Adams to task about.<br /><br />Does \\"11\\" have any memorable melodies? No. Does \\"11\\" have interesting lyrics? No. Does \\"11\\" have anything to offer in terms of entertainment value? No. Could you, in effect, play \\"11\\" in the background of some party and no one would remember it? Yes.<br /><br />There are no melodies like \\"Cuts Like A Knife\\", \\"This Time\\", \\"Straight From The Heart\\", \\"Summer Of '69\\", \\"Somebody\\", \\"Run To You\\", \\"One Night Love Affair\\", \\"It's Only Love\\", \\"Heaven\\", \\"In The Heat Of The Night\\", \\"Victim Of Love\\", \\"Hearts On Fire\\", \\"Everything I Do, I Do It For You\\", \\"All For One\\", \\"Please Forgive Me\\", \\"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman\\", \\"On A Day Like Today\\" etc., etc.<br /><br />Let's be frank. Bryan Adams has never been a brilliant lyricist, and \\"11\\" is no food for thought. Just look at the titles...\\"Broken Wings\\"--isn't that a Mr. Mister song? \\"She's Got A Way\\"--isn't that a Billy Joel song? \\"Mysterious Ways\\"--isn't that a U2 song? \\"The Way Of The World\\"--isn't that a Genesis song? \\"I Thought I'd Seen Everything\\"--wait a minute isn't  that a Bryan Adams song? Oh right, \\"Thought I'd Died And Gone To Heaven\\", that's it.<br /><br />What is so annoying about Bryan Adams is that he has never taken a musical risk in 28 years. It's always the same. It's like a fast food. You think it might taste good, so you buy it. Only to find that it was truly unsatisfying and you wish you could take back your money. There's nothing nutritious, and a day later you've forgotten you even ate it.<br /><br />This might sound like harsh criticism, but come on! You Bryan Adams fans are really going to get behind \\"11\\"? You're going to give it five stars? It's better than \\"Reckless\\"? Or better than \\"Waking Up The Neigbours\\". Are you really going to say that \\"11\\" is the best thing Adams has done? At 48, is Adams really writing great songs like he used to? Some of the lyrics are downright childish and adolescent.<br /><br />Let's go to the numbers. After \\"Waking Up The Neighbours\\" in 1991, every album Adams has released in the states has been diminishing financial returns. I mean \\"18 'Til I Die\\" (1996), \\"On A Day Like Today\\" (1998) and \\"Room Service\\" (2004) combined haven't sold as much as \\"Reckless\\" sold in 1984/1985. Yet, he still manages to woo the Europeans for some reason, and THEY think WE have bad taste in music?<br /><br />\\"18 'Til I Die\\" was the last Adams album that had an American hit on it, and it was tacked on from a movie soundtrack, meaning it wasn't originally intended for the album. \\"On A Day Like Today\\" didn't have a hit, and \\"Room Service\\" didn't have a hit. Why is this? Could it be, that like \\"11\\", they don't have that old Bryan Adams magic?<br /><br />Believe it or not, I have stuck with Adams for the past 25 years, but I'm not going to gush about the atrophied state of his musical career. I dare Bryan Adams to do something unexpected and interesting. I dare him after 28 years to come up with something so unique and original that he wins back the millions of fans who have fallen asleep and forgotten about him in America. Even my wife can't remember the last time she heard something from him, and she has trouble remembering a song from Bryan Adams because it has been so long since he made good music.<br /><br />So there you have it. Give me the negative votes for being honest, but \\"11\\" is the worst. I listened to it every day this week, and I couldn't wait to get it out of my player, which is not how I felt about \\"Reckless\\".t behind \\"11\\"? You're going to give it five stars? It's better than \\"Reckless\\"? Or better than \\"Waking Up The Neigbours\\". Are you really going to say that \\"11\\" is the best thing Adams has done?

B000E1MTY0|5.0|Now to be clear on my title. There was nothing wrong with this HD-DVD. The sound was fantastic, the picture was awesome. But as I am speaking Warner Bros. has decided as of May 31st. 2008 to stop all HD-DVD production so if you have to decide watch HD Format to back the industry has already done it for you.  With that being said, Christopher Nolan, did a fantastic job with this film.  For my money, this is the best Batman film I have ever seen.  This film goes more deeply into Bruce's past.  His relationship with his father and his life before all the tragedy.  It also goes more deeply into Gotham City itself and how the criminals and the corrupt more or less run the city.  And there is an underlying theme of what is  the right way about and wrong way with fighting crime.  Props to all these actors, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cane, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, and Gary Oldman.  These guys did such a fantastic with their respective DC characters.  A movie I wasn't disappointed in.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I'm glad I got this one instead of 'The Song Remains The Same'. The Earl's Court section is increadible! Great qaulity and sound all around. You won't be dissapointed.
0767821629|3.0|I love the movie, but was really disappointed in this DVD!  When I purchased it, I didn't notice that it was only the full screen version.  Coming back to check on Amazon, it seems this movie is not even available in wide screen!  (At least not in region one.)  So many of the special effects shots are wasted in a full screen version.  You don't really get the full effect. If they ever do a widescreen version I would buy it but this DVD does not do the movie justice.      Another disappointment in this DVD is the lack of special features.  This DVD is listed as a \\"Special Edition.\\"  Seeing that, I was expecting some good special features, but all it had was the trailer, a few still shots, and a VERY brief one-screen bio on the actors.  That is not what I would expect from a special edition!    I get the impression the DVD version was rushed together with very little thought.  Sony, you can do better than this!!!
0441013597|5.0|I read it recently when one of my high school students loved it and said, \\"You have to read it!\\"  So I did--and loved it.  (Thanks, Orion!) Don't know why I didn't just jump on the band wagon decades ago when my friends were reading it, but I'm glad to have read it now.  A truly satisfying sci-fi read.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|the Album is great and the animation is great.  very recomended!   if you have the CD you really need to get this.   - and also if you don't!
B000BBOUCW|5.0|I got this for my son and he seemed to like it alot. I haven't watched it so all I can say is that 13 year old boys seem to like it
B000V7O0H6|5.0|Now to be clear on my title.  There was nothing wrong with this HD-DVD.  The sound was fantastic, the picture was awesome.  But as I am speaking Warner Bros. has decided as of May 31st. 2008 to stop all HD-DVD production so if you have to decide watch HD Format to back the industry has already done it for you.  The movie itself is not so much a sequel or a prequal it is more homage movie to the original 1978 Superman The Movie.  Now a lot of people have voiced their displeasure for this movie.  Even hardcore Superman fans have voiced their displeasure of this film.  I, on the other hand really enjoyed this film.  Brandon Routh really embodies the dual role of Superman and Clark Kent.  He really reminds me of Christopher Reeve in a lot of ways.  If you listen he changes his octave of his voice when he is speaking as Superman similar to Reeve in Superman The Movie.  Kate Bosworth got so much crap for her protrayal of Lois Lane.  She is not as over the top as Margot Kidder but she still has that sex appeal and the same steely delivery that has made Lois Lane such an attractive character.  Lastly, Kevin Spacey did a fantastic job as Lex Luthor.  Again, he did not try to copy any Lex Luthor's before him (I.e. Gene Hackman (Superman The Movie) or John Shea (Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman)  I found that his Lex is a combination of the two.  Funny, when he wants to be but very cold and evil when he chooses too.  Lastly, Bryan Signer, Dan Harris, and Michael Daughtry the creative team who also did the first two X-men films did a fantastic job with this movie.  Bringing back the spirit of Superman to movie screens was a challenge but they did it very well.
006135323X|2.0|Sometimes, after reading a book describing a scientific field, like  Dawkins' Ancestors' Tale, or Pais' Inward Bound, I come away with  enormous respect for richness of the subject, the depth of insight, and  sublety of the reasonning.  Above all, one realises how far human  understanding has come from commonplace perceptions.  But not with this  book.  There seems to me to be nothing very deep about the insight that  people are not always rational or honest in their economic transactions,  or that their irrational behavior is amenable to simple psychological  explanation.  Are economists really surprised to learn that the world is  not populated with completely rational actors?    The experiments reported are often amusing, but they hardly appear to be  the product of giant intellects: many of them aren't far removed from  high-school science projects, enacted on a large scale, plus a bit of  statistical analysis.  There is a certain irony in the fact that the  author is concerned about the erosion of ethical standards, while he  himself in some of his work deceives or even lies to his human subjects.    Dr Ariely is a cheerful fellow, who writes with a light, engaging tone.  His stories and anecdotes keep us interested, but despite his clear  intention to do so, he fails to impress.  He has brillant colleagues,  tenured professors at MIT, Harvard, Stanford and Columbia, as he  constantly reminds us.  But this is not rocket science: rather it is, to  quote Richard Wagner, an abyss of superficiality.
0440241413|3.0|However goofy and silly you have thought these books are, well...they probably are. But, I choose to read it because my good friend becky recommended it to me and lent it to me. It didn't start out strong with me, I seemed to be mostly annoyed at the Shopoholic for the beginning of the book, but I am not entirely unsure that the author did not mean to do this. Not to far into the book, it gained that addictive quality for me, meaning whenever I got a second it was what I would go to grab.<br /><br />The book is worth reading, it is really naive, and obnoxious, and sometimes you just want to grab the shopaholic and strangle her so that she will learn to make better choices...but she does learn some things that make her much more likable after the first bit. She definitely grew on me, and now, even though I have filled my craving for chick-lit for a little while, when I need a brainless break I will definately pick up the next one! Like I mentioned about it earlier, for what it is it is good. It is fun to read, it has that brainlessness of watching tv...but you are reading! Give it a try, let me know what you think.
B00005BAIQ|4.0|I must be in the class that loves it, because this is a funny movie - lots of chuckles from the understated performances of David Niven as Bond, especially in the Scottish castles with the 19 daughters.      Enter Woody Allen as Bond's long lost son, Jimmy Bond: \\"I have a very low threshhold of death.  My doctor says I can't have bullets enter my body at any time.\\"  If you don't find this quote amusing or funny, that's because it's not!  And neither is Woody - as usual!  Quite fortunately, his first slot only lasts a minute.  His second appearance, later in the movie is much better, largely due to the fact that he doesn't speak much.  But back to main characters.    In order to confuse his enemies, the original Bond (Niven) has a new 'James Bond' trained - this time one that can resist beautiful women, as threats to the life of Bond usually come in the guise of beautiful women.  Some great scenes of these gorgeous girls coming out to kiss the new Bond, only to have him Judo throw them to the ground - hilarious!     There are as many funny scenes in this film as there are beautiful girls. It reaches levels of absurdity that are almost profound!  Of course you know not to expect a real Bond movie.  Look at the cover of the zone 2 Casino Royale - here's a test.  If you think there's something humorous just looking at this guy's face (and remember - he's Bond!), then you'll probably like this movie.  There is one scene however where Sellers suddenly becomes Bond - like out of the blue - I didn't quite catch the logic there first time around..  First he's Evelyn Tremble trying to reach some unknown objective and next thing he's Bond!  What?!  HOLD ON JUST A SECOND.  I went back and watched it again! ---- Evelyn Tremble (Sellars) wrote a book on winning at gambling.  After being seduced (and given $100,000 to gamble with), he agrees to take on evil SMERSH representitive Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) at the Baccarat table - under the guise of *James Bond* (so as not to be recognized as the famous author Evelyn Tremble!).  His chance of putting LeChiffre out of commission comes in winning against LeChiffre at high stakes Baccarrat.      Later, the daughter of the David Niven James Bond and Mata Hari, is brought into play.  Her job is to stop LeChiffre's art auction from being able to raise enough enough money to help him cover gambling debts, thus forcing him back to the table (where Evelyn Tremble, aka James Bond, will play against him).    Thumbing their noses to \\"What's New Pussycat?\\" (1965, which I saw recently and loathed), young Mata Hari is escaping her mother's East German headquarters where she'd been sent to foil the auction and as she and her taxi driver are running away, she considers going down a sewer grate in the road - as she opens the man-hole cover, the theme song from \\"What's New Pussycat?\\" comes wafting out!  \\"Better not go down there!\\" says her cab driver.  Fortunately, this movie never does, though both movies were made around the same time.      Actually, I thought this movie was great even when I was getting lost in the story the first time - that much more reason to watch it the second time - you notice a lot more jokes, and start catching the twisted logic in the plot.    At one point later in the movie, a certain Miss Goodthighs puts some 'LSD' in the form of alka-seltzer in Sellar's drink and a mock Beatles song comes on as they sink into a fantasy.      When things start getting even more splicy and psychedelic later on (and they do!), don't give up!  Consider it a challenge! Or just 'go with the flow'..  It's pure audacity. And rest assured, after the flying saucer comes, things start to resume the thread of logic again - logic, that is, for this wacked out 1967 made James Bond spoof...  ;)

B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. My copy had a few scratches on it, especially after seeing them in concert December 2007 in Las Vegas. They played all the songs off this album and brought back a lot of great memories of the original David Lee Roth when Van Halen was in their prime. The cd was purchased recently (Feb 2008) at amazon and sent in a timely manner.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I don't understand all the reviews saying \\"Oh they're not Sabbath or Zep, don't bother\\". Thats like saying \\"they're not the greatest rock band of this decade, so they suck\\". Stockdales vocals are on par with any you can find in modern rock today, and the creative riffs cover up a lack of talent in the musicianship here (ala Jet). If these guys could tear out an ear-bleeding solo or two, they'd be rock gods. Sadly, I can play almost everything on the album and I suck at guitar. But thats the only thing you can take away from these guys. They incorporate lots of organs and symphonic sounds and heavy-as-hell riffs into what is at least an entertaining album. The mystical lyrics and stylistic variations push it over the top into the \\"must listen\\" category, even if its not, as has been stated ad naseum, one of the best rock albums in the history of the world.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|A very good space ship story in the very hottest part of the solar system.<br />Some religious overtones, but all in all pretty much an hard science effort.<br />The kind of bomb that could ignite or reignite the sun really<br />isn't possible with our technology. The gravity on the space ship<br />is also not explained ( they really should be weightless in most of this).<br />I liked it even with the faults and the acting , sets and directing were very good; they just needed a better technical adviser?
0743454529|5.0|I have not yet read all of Picoult's novels. I only just discovered this amazing writer in 2007! As an avid reader I can't believe I did not know of her novels before. I am currently starting on reading my 5th Picoult novel and have so far loved all of them. However,\\" My Sister's Keeper\\" is my favorite and has made my personal top 20 list of all time fav novels. Picoult created characters you truly care about. The ending is like nothing I have ever experienced before in a novel.
0790737345|1.0|An angel of death (Nicolas Cage) falls in love with a surgeon (Meg Ryan) and wishes he were a real man.<br /><br />I like love stories, but this was just too corny for me.  Meg overdoes her perky-girl-next-door persona.  When she flashes her big trademark grin or lets a single tear trickle ever-so-slowly down her beautiful face, it feels like she's just posing.  I didn't buy her as a real person; there's too much staring thoughtfully into the camera and spouting trite dialogue.  And who races downhill on a bike at the edge of a cliff with no hands and eyes closed?  I'm still wondering why Nic Cage is a star.  He plays the same gosh-gee-whiz angel that Brad Pitt did in [[ASIN:B00005JCAA Meet Joe Black]] minus Brad's good looks, charm, and sex appeal.  His unwavering nobility is way too precious and those lingering close-ups - please!<br /><br />The movie is burdened with a clich&eacute;d script that constantly implores us to Appreciate Life! Dare to Love! Reach Out and Touch Someone!  Eat a Pear While There's Still Time!  There is nothing to balance the sticky sentimentality except for Dennis Franz as an annoying ex-angel.  I liked the use of the beautiful song, \\"In the Arms of an Angel,\\" but can't recommend this movie.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|I've read some of the other reviews here and disagree with a lot of them. I have never read the book and I saw the Vincent Price version of this movie when I was very young. So, I came to this version with basically a clean slate. And I liked it.<br />There are so many things I liked about it I don't know where to begin. The special effects were great, although a number of people dissed the CGI, I thought it worked well. The story follows a logical line for the situation, I liked that a lot too. Will Smith.... 'nuff said there.<br />The first half and the second half of the movie did, for me at least, fit together. In his travels one day, Will Smith notices one of his mannequins where he did not place it. He is distraught and investigates. While he is investigating, he's pulled into a trap similar to one he used on one of the vampires. As evening closes in, his watch beeps and wakes him up. A battle ensues between him, his dog and the 'night seekers'. During the battle he's rescued by a stranger who takes him to his home unaware that the 'night seekers' watched and now know where he and she are. They come back later that evening for the final confrontation.<br />So, there is a transition that takes place. It takes the movie from a peaceful but lonely route into a dangerous one. The vampires that Will Smith had been able to avoid can now locate him.<br />The moral and ethical implications this film stirs up are tremendous. Scientific experimentation to cure cancer seems to have been the cause of the transformation in this story. That in itself brings up endless wagers and exhaustive arguments over right and wrong. Will Smith's character states 'God didn't do this. We did.' Placing the blame for the destruction of mankind onto mankind in a way that's different from other similar movies.<br />Although this is not really a classic film, it is indeed a fine film and well worth watching. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or movies that can be debatable afterwards.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|I enjoyed this flic immensely.  I went into it thinking that only parts of the movie were CG, and it bothered me initially that it was 100% that way... but the movie was good, and I got used to the graphical view.  The clarity was amazing and the sounds were intense.  Overall, a must have - even if you buy the standard DVD (I think)... but I would go HD.  They should eventually release on Blu-ray, so if you are holding out, keep holding - it is worth it!
B0015KO52S|5.0|I bought this album on it's release date and after listening to it at least a dozen times it still grows on me every time I listen to it.  The first play thru I wasn't sure how I felt about it so I gave it another listen.  There are at least 6 or 7 really rocking tracks on this album and the rest isn't to shabby either.  All in all its a hell of a lot different than there first album but I think that they hit it out of the park with this album.  Buy it now and give it several listens if you haven't already.  Consolers of the Lonely is one of the better albums in it's  entirety that I have heard to date.  Jack White is truly one of god's gifts to great music and he puts that on display in this album.  Kudos to a job well done!
B00005JMCW|4.0|In this case, the remake is somewhat of an improvement on the original. I have been a Disney fan for more than 60 years. As an old timer, I tend to prefer the classics. However, this particular movie has a better story line and much better acting.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job as usual; and Lindsay Lohan is far better in this role than any of her other efforts to this point. I was pleased to see than the original, slapstick father has been replaced by a believable boyfriend, played by Mark Harmon.<br /><br />This 'happily ever after' ending leaves room for a sequel, but I hope that Disney won't go there. It is time to stop making Part 2 for every Disney movie. Part 1 is just fine with me.

0307237702|3.0|I gave Mr. Barak Obama's book, The Audacity of Hope three stars hoping that people from both sides of the isle would possibly read this review.  If you are of a liberal mindset I believe you will find the book to be at least four stars and likely five stars.  It is well written and gives some specifics as to how Mr. Obama views the world and how government and its citizens should interact.      For conservative minded people like myself I highly recommend investing the time to read the book.  Mr. Obama is likely to be the Democratic candidate for the presidency and stands a decent chance of winning the oval office.  It's for this reason that I encourage conservative minded people to read and study what Mr. Obama's views are.  The adage of know your adversary is applicable.    The book is broken out by chapters which discuss different topics such as, Faith, Optimism, Foreign Policy and experience, Race, The Constitution, Family as well as several others.   Below are several different ideas from throughout the book that I found interesting.    - \\"Money does matter in education. But there is no denying that the way many public schools are managed poses at least as big a problem as how well they're funded.\\" (pg. 161)  I find this argument to be disingenuous.  Take for example my home city of St. Louis.  The city school system is a disaster. However, the per pupil expenditure is $12,500, which is higher than most of the surrounding suburb systems.  More money will not solve this ultra important issue.  We already spend more on educating our children than any other country and yet our results are less than encouraging.    -  \\"Business groups may argue that a more unionized workforce will rob the U.S. economy of flexibility and its competitive edge.  But it's precisely because of a more competitive global environment that we can expect unionized workers to want to cooperate with employers - so long as they are getting their fair share of higher productivity.\\" (pg. 182)  Ifind this simply either naïve or a bold face lie.  Either way, this isn't the mentality I want from my president.  All we have to do is look to the auto unions to see that this statement is not a realistic view.  The auto unions, even as the US auto industry is being handed its lunch by the Japanese, refuse to accept meaningful changes to keep our auto companies competitive.  - On page 239-240 he talks about how Robert, a person he was on the campaign trail with in Cairo, Illinois, got up and left an event when he realized that the club they were in did not allow blacks.  Mr. Obama says on page 240, \\"But I don't want to confer on such bigotry a power it no longer possesses.  I choose to think about Robert, instead, and the small but difficult gesture he made...\\".  This seams in stark contrast to the fact that we now know his pastor's views and what appears to be the views of Mr. Obama's overall church membership.  Yet he continued to stay in this racist church for twenty two years and still refuses to leave.    - \\"I believe in keeping guns out of our inner cities, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers\\" lobby. (pg. 215)    To conclude, I believe Mr. Obama is going to be a worthy adversary for the Republican Party due to his likeability and good communication skills.  My view of his strength has been somewhat diminished over the last couple of weeks due to the Reverend Wright controversy but I am not willing to count him out from being a formidable contender and future player in American politics.

B001683T8U|5.0|Of all the Jane Austen movies, the 1996 miniseries \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is arguably the best and most detailed, as well as the most beloved.<br /><br />And even for newbies, this lush, gradual adaptation will unfold in a suitably interesting way, while remaining faithful to the original comedy of manners. It's graced with outstanding acting, Austen's sly wit intact, and a romantic story that never follows the ordinary mold -- sort of a thinking-girl's romance movie.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter) moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to eldest Jane (Susannah Harker). But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie (Jennifer Ehle) immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), who scorns the rural village and its inhabitants.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships arrive, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham (Adrian Lukis), who claims to have been horribly wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals the shocking secrets that Wickham won't tell her about his past behavior. Needless to say, her opinions of both men change instantly.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia (Julia Sawalha) elopes with Wickham, and lives with him without being married. For the time, very shocking. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie.<br /><br />It's obvious from the very first scenes -- when Lizzie jokingly comments that \\"a man of good fortune MUST be in want of a wife\\" -- that this is an adaptation that was done with love. The subplots, characters and atmosphere of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" are all here, and there are no attempts at modernizing or changing a classic story.<br /><br />The plot unfolds slowly, one piece at a time, but with several subplots that twine together as the story progresses, like ivy vines on the side of an old country house. For a miniseries, it's actually rather spare and lacking in filler. And the dialogue -- based on Austen's -- is wonderfully well-written, with lots of sly humor woven in (\\"Beauty is not the only virtue. She has just inherited a fortune of ten thousand pounds, I understand...\\" \\"Now THAT is a definite virtue!\\")<br /><br />The time period is recreated with loving detail, from the muddy roads to the sweeping mansions with elaborate grounds and gardens, and the gorgeously manicured exteriors of Pemberly. Even the hairstyles are recreated, unflattering as they sometimes are. And the entire plot is steeped in the mores of 19th-century England, with the attitudes toward marriage, love, and propriety that bound everyone ... especially all women.<br /><br />And the casting of the leads is absolutely perfect for this movie: Ehle and Firth are nothing short of astounding as Darcy and Lizzie Bennett. Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways. Firth's Darcy is a selfish, chilly man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Ehle's Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way, but too blinded by appearances. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />They're also backed by an excellent supporting cast, with slimy clergy, screeching moms, sly seducers, sardonic fathers, innocent sisters and aristocratic old harpies adding colour to it all. Sawalha is especially good as the 19th-century Valley Girl, and Alison Steadman gives a grating but suitable performance as the whiny, marriage-obsessed Mrs. Bennett.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the cream of the Austen crop, and an understatedly romantic movie as well.

B000RPSVE0|5.0|\\"CD of the year\\" is what Jessica Duchen called this stunningly beautiful recording at her blog on Dec. 21, 2007: [...].  She wrote, in full:<br /><br />\\"CD of the year: Terezin, recorded by Anne Sofie von Otter with Bengt Forsberg, Daniel Hope and friends. This is one of the most extraordinary discs that's ever come my way, and the most devastating. Ilse Weber, a young nurse, volunteered to go with the sick children of Terezin to death at Auschwitz so that she could take care of them en route; her songs are the heart of this recording. It's said she sang 'Wiegala' with the children in the gas chamber. The CD also features music by Pavel Haas, Hans Krasa and the solo violin sonata by Erwin Schulhoff, plus some amazing, black-humoured cabaret songs.\\"<br /><br />I will add that some of the songs are about being at Terezin (or leaving it to be murdered at Auschwitz), and some of these are unbearably sad, but others are sprightly.  Some of the songs are poems unrelated to the Holocaust that composers set to music while at Terezin.  The songs are sung in Czech or German, with the booklet containing translations into English and French as well.  Some leave melodies running through your head, while others are more challenging, but all are wonderful.  This CD is beautiful beyond words -- at least any words that I can come up with.<br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about this music and its composers and performances, I recommend Music In Terezin: 1941-1945, by Joza Karas.  It is not much as literature, but it contains the facts about the music at this concentration camp.
0975991477|5.0|This is a must-read book for people like me, non-scientists who might hope there is something more to life than the material world but are baffled (if not downright disheartened) by the atheistic assertions espoused by people like Richard Dawkins.  The problem with issues like the existence of the soul beyond the chemical functions of the brain, or of mankind having a purpose on earth, is that while these are fascinating topics to discuss, you can never really get anywhere as they inevitably end up being purely philosophical.  No matter how eloquently one might speak on man's higher consciousness, the proofs of Aquinas blah blah blah, there will always be a Richard Dawkins in the room sniggering at you and saying \\"Prove it\\".  This book really does change that.  In easy, clear, but evidential science, Bruce Lipton takes you with contagious enthusiasm through his own discoveries as a PhD researching in cell biology -- which unexpectedly for him, resulted in his discovery of the energy field holding us all in being.  We don't exist; we are 'existed'.  Furthermore, Lipton proposes that the survival-of-the-fittest model of evolution is, on evidence, flawed; that life evolved because of cooperation between cells, not as a battle for dominance, and that these same principles of cooperation between cells and communities of cells are vital for the health of each individual body.    This is a book I plan to read again, because it has given me enormous confidence to know that there is more and more evidence in science that reveals what I always hoped was not just a silly emotional instinct - that there is a God, even if we don't quite know what that means, and that we are all part of a universal spirit.  In fact, after reading this book, the rantings of the scientific materialists seem silly and old-fashioned.  They won't be able to dishearten me any more.

B00005JPKE|5.0|I have been watching it on AMC, and am purchasing this film.    I highly recommend this film, even though the subject matter is painful to watch, it deals with the letters written home, and the experiences of  Japanese soldiers trapped on Iwo Jima, from the personal viewpoints of them.  You see the madness of a fanatic Leiutenant, the humanity of regular guys, trapped in something way over their heads.  You see how fanaticism warped ancient tradition, turning what was once a matter of honor into an insane disregard for basic humanity.    When you see an Olympic equine jumper try to maintain a shred of normal  life-it crashes in around him after a strafing run kills his beloved horse.    Not all of the men trapped inside the caves bought into the official line  of madness, one poor soul grabs family photos while sobbing, only to pull  the grenade pin-because everyone else has bought into this warped idea  of honor.    It's no honor, especially when one thinks of the utterly futile waste of  good men, men who could have contributed so very much to the rebuilding  and economic boom of the post-war era.  Maybe because I think from a fem-  inine horror of waste-but these men would have been wonderful assets to  their families and nation after the war-if they hadn't been trapped into  an utterly futile and stupid death.    What a waste-and shame on the people who blithely proclaimed such bull,  without realizing the stupid, stupid futile madness of it all.    It's hard not to cry about such a terrible waste of life.
006135323X|4.0|As a student in university, Dan Ariely had a professor who would encourage him to propose theories and then to devise experiments that would be able to identify the veracity of his theories. As such, he has approached psychology with the rigor of an experimental scientist, and the resume of his experiences is this enjoyable book that documents several of the fallacies of the human brain. Dan Ariely's main thesis is that people don't always act the way they do for rational reasons, and then goes to show how in a dozen series of experiements.     The experiments range from analytic mistakes (why do people overvalue free goods as opposed to 1-penny goods?) to the power of suggestion (does thinking about the Ten Commandments reduce the incidence of cheating?), and most of us will recognize mistakes we ourselves make on a daily basis. He also exposes fundamental truths that go against traditional economics, such as why we will do things for free in social contexts that we would charge exorbitant amounts for under market situations.     The book is well-written and, at under 250 pages, it's a breeze to read. If Ariely has one weakness, it's when he recommends solutions to the behaviors he seems, which mostly seem to involve government. One of his biggest whoppers: \\"If you accept the premise that market forces and free markets will not always regulate the market for the best, then you may find yourself among those who believe that the government (we hope a reasonable and thoughtful government) must play a larger role in regulating some market activities, even if this limits free enterprise.\\" Ariely himself finds the flaw in his prescription, yet still recommends it!     Predictably Irrational can be enjoyed by almost anyone; it's not so much economics as sociology and psychology, and requires no real background in any of these fields. Ariely is a thoughtful analyst of the human condition, and rarely will a book be able to discuss masturbating college students, the healingpower of European kings and British negotiations with the IRA with a common thread.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is an epic performance of the most epic of operas.  The Met brings all of its awesome technical capabilities to bear in creating a splendid, if traditional, visual presentation, very nearly matched by sumptuous and passionate vocal and theatrical performances.  James Morris is one of the best Wotans of the past generation.  Siegfried Jerusalem is a thrilling Siegfried (and a surprisingly good Loge).  Hildegarde Behrens does not fit the usual physical type for a Walkure and is not Birgit Nilssen, but still sings and acts a vital and exciting Brunnhilde.  Christa Ludwig and Jessye Norman both are perhaps a little past their primes, but do very well in filling their rolls as Fricka and Sieglinde.  Etc., etc. all the way through the impressive and large cast.  Levine's conducting is never boring and often electrifying.  I was very pleased with this DVD set, especially after being very disappointed in the Met's static and boring Tristan.

0684865130|4.0|When I first picked up Catch-22, I expected to be bored to death by yet another long and dull novel about war. Within the first chapter, I was surprised to find that the book was funny in a darker and satirical way.     At first I thought that this book was about the insanity of war and it's crazy bureaucracy, but upon further reflection I have found this novel to be more about moral decisions and ethics. Sure, Yossarian wanted to be sent home from the war, but he would not okay General Peckem's and Cathcart's theory that it is acceptable to continually raise the number of flight missions, which would endanger the lives of others in the squadron. This huge moral dilemma is the climax of the book, and when Yossarian makes the ethical choice and sacrifices his guaranteed safety for the overall good, the reader is left with a contented feeling.    I am glad that I got the opportunity to read Catch-22. I strongly recommend the book to anyone and everyone who has the time to read and enjoy it.

B0010X745K|2.0|THE MIST has the full panorama of responses, from those who find it 'the best of the Stephen King story adaptations' to those who find it a feeble attempt to wed science fiction with biblical predictions. Frank Darabont  has consistently brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success.  For this film he's gathered a substantial cast, used computer generated graphics well, but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures.<br /><br />David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake.  Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town: could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains?  The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling, and while brave David tries to fix it (mind you, in this town with no electricity, the lights in the main store remain on....), he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise.  Returning to the storefront, David informs the crowd of his findings, but his descriptions are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations, and the pessimistic out-of-towner Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who has a running disagreement with David. But gradually David gathers some sensible folk (Toby Jones, Chris Owen, et al) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning, the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad. Thus we have two factions: those who side with Mrs. Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape.  The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father/son devotion, mass hysteria, mob rule, revenge on the military for loosing these 'other world monsters' on the public,  and 'what do we do if this is the end of the earth'.  How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others.<br /><br />So why rate this film with two stars instead of one?  Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs. Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him. Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane, and for an action hero, he seems to melt with the circumstances.  The movie is long, silly, not scary, and suffers from a weak script.  For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile.  For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters, pass on this film.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|\\"Stardust\\" has become a classic fantasy film in a remarkably short period of time.  For people who haven't had a chance to see this wonderful film, by all means buy \\"Stardust.\\"  It's a wonderful tale about growing up and becoming an adult.  And, in my opinion, Michelle Pfeiffer is the sexiest Celtic witch I've ever seen. But, with that said, the BIGGEST disappointment is that \\"Stardust\\" isn't on Blu-ray yet.  Paramount opted for the now defunct HD-format.  I also own an HD-format copy of \\"Stardust\\" and it is indeed quite awesome, and is way better than this conventional DVD...but since HD is now gone the way of the dinosaur, this won't do people much good to buy it since it will end up in the bin with all the Lazer discs (remember those?)  I also have a Blu-ray player which upscans (i.e. it takes conventional DVD's and makes them look better.)  Most of my up-scanned DVD's look great...but for some strange reason up-scanned \\"Stardust\\" just doesn't look that good. It would be a shame if this new classic film ended up being preserved only in conventional DVD format.  It deserves to be on Blu-ray.  So, go ahead and buy this conventional DVD and also write Paramount to urge them to put \\"Stardust\\" on Blu-ray for future generations to enjoy.

Gilbert's not a bad writer, which kept me plugging along, hoping for more. I kept waiting for this whiny, self-absorbed woman to grow from her worldly experiences, but, alas, she never did. In the end, I'm sorry I bothered to finish the book.
B00005JKED|5.0|I just finished watching it. I always thought Washington was the good man's good actor lacking that nerve and that bulge of testosterone. I thought American Gangster was the first time he did something with a shade of grey. How wrong was I? TRAINING DAY is truly one of the most absorbing, relentless, gutsy, powerful, powerful, upfront and non-boring action/drama movies I've seen.<br /><br />This film truly edges on it's morality. It is in it's own hemisphere. LA or Los Angeles is stunning. I'm tempted to think this is what is like or maybe it's just a film. I know in it's 2 hours - Training Day tried to show a certain half of a cop's life. Maybe all cops are this way and maybe they are not but I'm just left quite speechless at the perfromances.<br /><br />When the film started and the restaraunt scene hit me, I thought OK, This is interesting but soon just about every scene hits you when you're expecting. If someone falls asleep while watching this film, they must be nuts or on McDonalds.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is brilliant. I don't know what happened to the man.<br /><br />The director is someone I've never heard of and I just searched the internet and found he's the same guy who did King Arthur and Tears of the sun. The latter I have not seen and the former's forgettable but I must get around to watching more films featuring the actor, the director and the same genre.<br /><br />I can clearly remember that the last film that shook me up just like training day did was a 2006 film that you clearly remember. And that was called \\"RUNNING SCARED\\"<br /><br />I'm not quite sure which one I liked more but that is the magic of the best films. It becomes difficult to compare.<br /><br />To those of you who haven't seen this film as of yet, guys and girls, men and madams......this is it. Look no further.<br /><br />MY Respect.
B00111L0MY|2.0|Aside from the fact that I had to turn on the subtitles because I couldn't understand half of what the Casey Affleck character saying, the movie was well-made and very well-acted. In this respect, I would give it 4 stars. But I am giving it 2 stars because of the way I felt after watching it. Most of my friends thought this was a great movie. I would tend to agree. But the end just left me drained and disappointed.
0761944524|5.0|When I study my MBA classes, this book helps me a lot. The book provides essential review of all Statistic knowledge in the beginning of each chaper, and then lead readers use SPSS step by step.  Especially the practical examples and funny illustration, I will say the book is the only one interesting and powerful Statistic book I can find. I highly recommand it for readers work for Marketing, Medical , Engineering , Finance, and MBA classes. The book can lead you to resolve many \\"real\\" problems.
0812550706|4.0|This book was recommended to me as a good science fiction novel for non-science-fiction types.  The story is gripping, and while it draws nicely from imaginative \\"sci-fi\\" concepts, it doesn't rely on them; the story stands on its own.  It focuses on themes of leadership and power that are fairly easy to relate to and get excited about.<br /><br />In a nutshell: It's a great story, and you don't have to be wild about spaceships and aliens to enjoy it.  It didn't change my life, so it doesn't get a fifth star, but it's great entertainment.

Will give you a heads up on the story and the words to the songs to make it more enjoyable.  If you do not plan on seeing the musical, get this to see what you are missing.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am a fitness video fanatic and I own Ms. Michaels other DVD's-The Biggest Winner and the cardio Biggest Loser DVD---she is featured.    This DVD had MANY of the same moves from her other programs. In fact it was a bit repetitve-the moves in the three work-outs overlap and the DVD offers almost identical moves as in her other DVD's.    While this is a super challenging set of three work-outs...the moves feel a bit tired after three times-jumping jacks, arm circles, plank moves,  bent over rows. Again and again. I believe this program would get you in shape but eventually boredom will set in. More creativity would make this a phenomenal DVD.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|Now, as a dutiful boyfriend, I've had to sit through my share of reeking romantic comedies, and some I've found more than merely tolerable. The plot is going to stink, that's a given - but maybe there'll be a laugh here or there, like in \\"Something about Mary.\\" Not this time. By the standards of the genre, this one is boring. Even my girlfriend, who drags me to these things without shame, suggested halfway through that we nuke this one and put on something else. So, fair warning: this one is as corny as a regular romantic comedy, but without any entertainment value. Dull as it gets. Cameron Diaz was atrocious, worst actress in the world, capable of only one character (and it's not cute any more.)    By the way, was I supposed to laugh when she punches her boyfriend in the face twice? Why is domestic violence funny when the woman is the attacker? This actually happens in reality, by the way. Imagine a guy beating his girl being played off as slapstick. There'd be an uproar.
1594489505|4.0|The language in this book is simple - a little too simple for my taste. Other than that the story is fascinating to the end, telling of the lives and destinies of different women (and men) in Afghanistan. It brings the culture of this country a little closer to home and the reader roots for the characters. I highly recommend it!
B000EDWKXI|5.0|The minute he died, I knew there would be a run on this film.  He is wonderful in it.  I had to own it!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen book at this time in my life and this movie represents it beautifully. They met. They fell in love. She broke it off. She regrets it. He comes back. Can they have a second chance? What more can you ask for? This is a British period piece, so the accents can be strong at times...be prepared. Also, it is not exactly like the book, a good reproduction, but not the same page for page. That shouldn't turn you off of the movie though. Nothing is ever as good as the original, but this movie does a decent job trying. Finally, don't expect twenty-somethings acting in this movie. If you want a younger cast, find the PBS/BBC version of Persausion. This movie is acted in by seasoned actors who also played the roles on stage. They know their characters and are very good at bringing them to life.
B000000OPQ|4.0|Okay, the movie was a bit over the top. It was about wrestling. I love this compact disc and I even had the audio cassette prior. I love the cover with Linda Fiorentino and Matthew Modine. The music like \\"Only the Young\\" Journey is truly classic with Steve Perry's great voice. There are other songs on this disc like Madonna's \\"The Gambler\\" and \\"Crazy for You\\" which was the alternate title for the movie. I play this disc in the car and it brings back so many great memories of that decade. I wished Linda Fiorentino would act again and do more now. It's hard to believe that the two stars are now 50 years old but great music is timeless!
B000003TSP|5.0|I can't think of an instance since Elvis Costello's brilliant This Year's Model that an artist or group so thoroughly obliterated the sophomore jinx in the face of high expectations as Portishead did on this one. And Portishead did so in the same way: by ratcheting up the intensity to a severe level just hinted at in their excellent, but comparatively tame debut.    By taking their distinctive, eerie sound to a new level, Portishead created a nightmarish, heart-wrenchingly emotional, yet catchy groove quite unlike anything before or since.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|One of the best Sci Fi movies ever. It wraps around your mind and cinematography lets you see things as if you were there.<br /><br />Of course, it looks way better in HD DVD
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you have any interest in the ark of truth, which is an excellent book, I would also highly recommend Diagnosing the Destruction of Young Men. Check it out on amazon.
B000002BHE|5.0|This is Celine's best album to date. Filled with powerful ballads and amazing lyrics, this is an album that after 12 years I still like to play like I just bought it yesterday.   My favorite song is \\"If that's what it takes\\" which is the English version of the French \\"Pour que tu m'aimes encore\\" released in 1995, one of Celine's signature songs. The English lyrics are a breathtaking declaration of love and a promise to fight and even die for love of that special someone(I will risk everything, I will fight, I will bleed  I will lay down my life, if that's what you need  Ev'ry second I live, that's the promise I make  Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes)    This is album is Celine's masterpiece.
B000HIVIOW|4.0|I first saw this video with my daughter on a pay-channel when she was about five. We were both charmed by the wordless story, and the pretty little boy-soprano song as they fly over the winter landscape. But I was always puzzled about the David Bowie reference, until I saw the youtube video with Bowie's sweet and sappy, very English introduction. It would be five stars to me if they put Bowie back in; as it is, this is still a great video. My daughter is 20 now, and I recently bought it for her, to remind her of what a fine human being I am. The jury's still out of my fineness, but the Snowman was a hit.
B000X6XHEW|5.0|I'd been looking for a really amazing version of Malaguena Salerosa, then I saw Kill Bill and saw that they'd done an amazing job covering a great classic.<br />What a great band!
B0016CQCMQ|5.0|Don't know who this Krumm guy is, but this ain't his normal Songs of Innocence....    This is easily one of the, if not THE, best album of the year so far.  It will be hard for another album to come along in the next 279 days to knock it off that pedestal.  Jack White's Detroit blues style meets the throwback style of Lawrence and Benson.  White's influence is predominate on most tracks, with definite White Stripes undertones abounding.  Normally this would be entertaining, but disappointing.  Instead, bass strummer Lawrence and drummer Keeler find a voice on this album distinctly lacking on Broken Boy Soldiers.  Combining the writing with the overtly pleasurable drumming and bass play along with the mix of style and instrumentation brings you to one of the best overall albums of the year.      Highlights of the album:    (1)Consoler of the Lonely, (3)You Don't Understand Me, (4)Old Enough, (5)The Switch and the Spur, (12)Rich Kid Blues, (14)Carolina Drama    Dig the trumpet work, fiddles.  See em live, it'll do you good!
B000NJLNPO|3.0|Not one of those blow you away albums, but still good and worth adding to your collection.
0140431179|5.0|This book includes three of Robert Louis Stevenson's best novellas.  Most people are familiar with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but without revealing too much I'll just say that Jekyll conducts experiments on personality.  Hyde shows up as a friend of the doctor, but he offends anyone in his presence with his nasty personality.  It's a thoughtful perspective on what people may be hiding from their social personalities and worth reading even if you're familiar with the story.<br /><br />The Beach of Falesa is the best of this collection.  In this little known tale, a British trader gets stationed on a small island in the South Pacific, but he immediately has trouble establishing his trade with the natives even though any foreigner, be he white, black, or Asian, holds higher social status than the natives. Such relations between races on an isolated island were normal during imperialism but are still surprising now. For example, the main character has free choice of any native girl to be his wife.  Stevenson honestly portrays imperialism's influence on the island while also exploring the beliefs of the natives and how they can be easily manipulated. This was a great page-turner, one of those rare ones that left me thinking about it months later.<br /><br />The Ebb Tide, the last and longest story in this collection, recounts the tale of three white men on an island in the Pacific, all stuck there because they're committed crimes or ruined their reputations in their home countries.  With all three broke, they come upon a discovery that will allow them to leave the island and make some money in the process.  However, as the darker side of these criminals come out at sea, events take a dark turn.  This is another tale that analyzes race relations in the South Pacific during imperialism, but focuses more on the abusive personalities of white criminals who end up stuck there.  Still, it has it's merits like Stevenson's good characterizations and is worth reading.<br /><br />All in all, this is an outstanding threesome of Stevenson's best short novels.  Although the story of Jekyll and Hyde is easily found, The Beach of Falesa and The Ebb Tide are extrememly difficult to find, making this in invaluable collection.  I was thrilled to come across some of Stevenson's rarer stories in this collection and highly recommend checking it out.outstanding threesome of Stevenson's best short novels.

0440238153|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot, though it was my least favorite of the trilogy.  THis is the most blatantly atheistic of the three books, which did make me someone uncomfortable.  However the writing is good and I could not stop reading until I was done.  I am lookoing forward to reading Lyra's Oxford, too, which continues the story.
B000H2MTUA|2.0|I was required to read this book for a school projet, and I took my teachers advice and came to the book with an open mind and high expectations based upon his praise. The first chapters are interesting and fun, as you feel for the character and his life struggles. But as time trudges on, I began to realise that this book was written by either a mentally challanged person or someone who is just plain dumb. While the lack of conventional grammar and punctuation is sometimes regarded as 'genious' I found it annoying and childish. I heard in his other book he became an English teacher? I hope not. That's embarrasing to be an English teacher and write like that.   Call me what you will for insulting one of the 'best written books of our century', as my English professor called it, but I found it childish, immature, and highly unbelievable from the point of a allegeded memior.

080701429X|4.0|This book offers a very insightful look into the human mind through circumstances so dire its almost difficult to contemplate. Fortunately, most of us will never likely come within reach of such dreadful circumstances; however, by means of this book we are able to ascertain meaning by vicariously viewing the experiences of Dr. Frankl and learning from his own thoughts and perceptions about the matter.<br /><br />This book rates high in its ability to help the reader search for meaning, define purpose, and gain an incredible sense of relativity.  I give four stars only as a result of its propensity to read like a psychology text book.  I admit, however, that may speak more to my weaknesses and lack of pursuit on such subjects than the quality of the writing.  As such, this is certainly not meant as a major detriment as the substance presented is excellent.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Most excellent, this 4 disc set has all 3 versions of Blade Runner. I especially love the 1st disc with the original theatrical version, with the voice over Ala Sam Spade by Harrison Ford.
0736063684|5.0|Excellent resource for budding fitness instructors.  Practical and clear.  Easy to follow and understand.
B0010X745K|4.0|Okay, I need to take a breath.  I just finished watching \\"The Mist,\\" and it was on point.  At first I was disappointed with the initial creature in the Mist.  I didn't want to see just yet what was in the Mist.  I thought, \\"oh no, not another  monster movie.\\" Luckily, thankfully, it wasn't, and I was more than satisfied when I began to see the other creatures in the Mist.  As the movie unfolded it began to get, and keep, my attention.  In this instance, (rare for most movies) questions that came to mind were answered: like why didn't they ask the soldier boys what was going on- answered; why didn't they make a flame thrower from a lighter and an aerosol can (yes, that was my question, hey they're in a supermarket and I have an Anarchist Cookbook mind)- answered.  I was wondering if and when the heretic would get hers- answered.  I actually became invested in a few characters, like Ollie, poor Ollie, I knew him well.  But all this didn't compare to the ending, I was hoping for a closer, but I didn't expect jaw dropping.  I kept mumbling to myself, \\"that's f**ked up, that's f**cked up.\\" If only they'd waited. . . In the end, I liked the film as a whole, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a horror/ psychological/ thriller, not necessarily in that order.  It is a great film that can leave me devastated.
0143038419|5.0|If you're traveling through Italy, *definitely* bring along EAT PRAY LOVE by Elizabeth Gilbert. Even if you only read the first third of the book, you will have enhanced your travels 10-fold. The book is the (non-overbearing and non-arduous) telling of one woman's journey to learn to experience the best in life and marry that with a spiritual peace. Her goal in Italy? Experience pleasure! Her anecdotes will not only provide for a fun read while you're on a long train ride or before going to bed, but they'll also provide fun facts, recommendations, and another person's view (non-guidebook view, that is) of some of the best aspects of Italy. In the book she lives in Rome so a lot of her focus is there, but her travels also take you to Venice, Florence, and Naples.
B000UPSKO8|5.0|This is one of the best music DVD's I've seen.  The soloists are terrific, the technical production is well done and all of the live performance excitement comes though.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This, pretty much, is our of my favorite movies. Great for most of the family, but I still don't recommend for small kids. Excellent story line, with a super blend of characters. What would make this a perfect 10? It should have a release for wide screen in 16x9, as there's not much worse than to having a $$$ wide screen plasma and being forced to see black bars top and bottom. Should be released in a 1.8 aspect ratio. Other than that, a very good movie.
1572815108|4.0|Very detailed and precise deck by notable occult scholar Aleister Crowley.      The complicated symbolism on some of the cards may make it overwhelming for beginners but there is nothing inherently more difficult or dangerous about using this deck over any other.      The artwork is still some of the best in publication as well.  Very fine deck in all ways.  Quite the classic.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|Once is an appropriate name for a movie that only inspires the viewer to watch this film ONLY ONCE. I would actually recommend this movie less than Once. And this movie did require 4 attempts by me to sit through this entire movie in \\"ONE\\" sitting, making ONCE an unmemorable experience. If asked my opinion about \\"ONCE\\" I would respond by first suggesting other \\"B\\" movies, or at the very least I would suggest that they not operate any heavy equipment or drive a car if you can avoid those activities after watching this show. I do; however, have the ability to respond to those who might ask, and my answer will be...Yes, I did view this movie \\"ONCE\\", and I feel I received very little in return.     g.bob
1932100660|5.0|If you want to know how diet links to serious disease such as cancer etc, this is a must have.

A truely remarkable book, it can save your life.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I'll leave it short and sweet - this is what I show to my friends and family when I want to show off the fact that I have a 1080p TV and Blu-Ray.  It looks absolutely stunning, and the quality and care that went into making Planet Earth is completely unparalleled.
B000YOGWAY|5.0|My daughter and her 8-year-old-friends who are reading the Harry Potter series love the Marauder's Map.  It unfolds wider than an adult's arm spread and shows secret passages, as well as the more conventional halls, stairs, and towers at Hogwarts.    The kids can see various levels within Hogwarts which helps them understand the spacial relationships of the floorplan.    Of all the Harry Potter toys at FAO Schwarz on a recent trip into NYC, this was the item selected by my daughter.  In fact, it was the item she selected from all the toys at FAO Schwarz within a reasonable price limit!    Because it is made out of a strong paper printed to look like parchment, it looks old to begin with.  When I warned my daughter to treat it gently, she said the more worn out it looks, the more real it will seem.  I have the feeling we'll be taping it together frequently over time but that will only make it more real in her mind.    It is a big price (we paid approx. $35) for a printed piece of paper but it has tremendous imagination and play value.
0321344758|3.0|i bought the book based on lot of those positive responses in amazon, also another books was referring to it. well, if you are totally new to web design and usability - maybe this is a good place to look at - but, most of things are little too common, you can work them out yourself. Annoying are also those comics & cartoon styles inside the book - reminds me a schoolbooks for a foreign language study. Too basic. really. and the amazon also changed a design, but a one section of a book is totally devoted on that :(. no more such tabs at amazon....as he writes in a book
0316001821|4.0|This book had me thinking about death and those left behind in a detached and thoughtful way. nice book.
B00132D808|5.0|I gotta say the tittle suits the music. I was a little disappointed at first that it didn't sound like \\"A fever you can't sweat out\\", but after listening to it all the way through I liked it. It's weird at first, but before you know it you got one of the songs stuck in your head. I suggest you get this cd if you like the other one.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|'The Mist' has to be one of the greatest films I've ever seen.  First, I watched it in color, and, second, I watched it in black and white.  I must say that the black and white version worked just as well.  Contrary to what a few people say about the ending, I think the ending worked exceptionally. This movie goes beyond horror. It touches on the subject that we, as a species, are weaker than we think.      Did 'The Mist' instill fear?  Yes.  Were there a few scenes that made me laugh?  Yes.  Did all of that work?  Absolutely!  No movie is perfect, but great filmmaking overshadows imperfections.  The Mist is that type of film.      I don't care what any basher of this movie says.  This movie is great, and it motivated me to buy Stephen King's 'Skeleton Crew'.      You don't have to take my word for it; watch it for yourself.  The question that comes up is:  Who are the monsters?  The creatures from another dimension?  Or us?
1881273377|5.0|I'm a great fan of both the cds and the book.  This is a perfect gift to give to any adult or high school graduate to help prepare them to have a successful married relationship or to help someone who is trying to improve their existing relationship. It also gives insight on what motivates people  which would be helpful in understanding coworkers and friends.
0307237702|4.0|I like the guy, but I was kind of disappointed in the book - not that there's anything wrong with it, for it's truly better than most others in its genre.  It's just that after hearing him speak and getting a dose of that extraordinary inspiration, charisma, and \\"it\\" factor that he exudes and captivates his audience with, the book just didn't come close to doing that for me.      'Audacity of Hope' is pretty much the well Obama draws on for his speeches: yeah, we're on the wrong track as a country, yeah, it's gonna take a lot of work to get back where we were and head where we want to go, but we can do it if we believe in ourselves, roll up our sleeves and get to it, instead of allowing cynicism and cumulative disappointments to lull us into do-nothing apathy.  You can boil the Obama message down to: \\"optimism is good, cynicism is bad, America is about optimism and can-do spirit, we're Americans, let's do it.\\"    And he tosses in some policy suggestions, some good, some not, some blah - while emphasizing he isn't necessarily wed to the details of any of them and is open to suggestions about how to improve them, but that they'd make a good starting point in the discussion for turning things around.      No real surprises in his policy prescriptions - I've come across versions of most of them someplace or other before.  Then again, the guy never promoted himself as a radical but as a species of idealistic pragmatist, so it stands to reason that his policy prescriptions would be in the mainstream/ slightly left of center range.    The disappointment of the book is that the same message that comes across so uplifting and inspiring when he orates it from the podium, just doesn't do the same when read in a book.  Maybe it's because I've read a lot of good books in my life, so an author has to be out and out extraordinary to impress me with his/her writing, but like most Americans of my generation (X) I haven't heard that many good speeches, what w/ public oratory seemingto be a dying art in this country and all.    Long and short of it, it's a good book on par with many other good political biographies, so if you enjoy that genre you'll enjoy 'Audacity of Hope' as well.  But if you've read a bunch of political autobiographies odds are you'll rank this one in the \\"pretty good but not exceptional\\" category.    Which is probably unfair to Obama - his extraordinary speechifying skills set the bar a tad too high for what I should've reasonably expected from his book.  It's a good, solid, read (which is why I went ahead and gave it four stars despite the disappointment), just nowhere near as electrifying and moving as one of his better speeches.    I recommend this book - at the time of this writing odds are pretty high that its author is gonna be our next Prez.  Unlike Dubya's ghostwritten autobiography that sheds no light on what (if anything) is in his noggin, 'Audacity of Hope' was definitely written by Obama, and is a decent window on how his train of thought gathers steam and moves (if you want a similar window into what makes him tick as a person, try the book he wrote 10 or so years before this one).
B000ZLFALI|4.0|This movie is great.  My order arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition.  I would recommend it for those of you that like this style of movie.
1891252089|5.0|Excellent book with pictures of poses for ashtanga yoga. Great detail including variations of poses.
B0010X745K|5.0|The cover of this DVD gives credence to the shocking ending. I was enticed by the trailer and gave this film a go while believing that I had been exposed to every kind of ending ever captured on film. I've seen gore, blood, mystery, blah, blah, blah. Nothing surprises me anymore. My hope was merely to be entertained. The movie boasts a depth of character, so-so special effects and an alluring story. A few good jumps, but not entirely 'scary'. Still, it held my interest. The ending lived up to the hype. I was expecting pretty much anything except for what happened, and I sat stunned through the end-credits while asking myself, \\"Did they really do that?\\" The ending is so shocking that I literally do not have the proper words. I dig that in a film. Show me something that hasn't been done before. Give me something to think about, and I'm sold.<br /><br />Mr. Darabont and Mr. King sold me.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|I adored The Royal Tenenbaums, and usually I find Wes Anderson's films fun and inventive. But sadly, TDL seemed like a misfire to me. The spritual journal of three brothers by train is a great concept, but this film seemed to lack the emotion necessary for me to care for the brothers, or to make me feel like they cared for each other. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vivid colors, beautiful turbans, and gorgeous settings. True, clever lines are scattered here and there, but overall I found the story too scattered, possibly in need some fine tuning, to care.
032147404X|5.0|I strongly recommend this book for anybody who wants to learn digital photography. The author gives a lot a tips and hints to get a grasp of what photographs should watch out when taking pictures, retouching them or buying gear.    Sure, this book is not a digital photography bible, and the author's humor is quite annoying. But his down to earth, straight to the point explanations are very helpful.     If you are looking for a book to start exploring the world of digital photography, this is the book to get.
1931559317|5.0|Things I like:  Spiral bound (can be opened flat for one or two page viewing)  Paper is sturdy & semi-glossy (dew resistant)  Convenient size (not too small or big)  Very good/clear charts (lots of detail)  Layout is easy to use (sky sections & order make sense)  Color coded details (easier to quickly identify what each item is)  Most items are labeled (M, NGC, IC, etc)  Index is very handy/complete (gives page #(s) for cataloged items)  Inexpensive    Things I didn't like:  Smaller size means flipping pages a lot  Although better than most, paper still suffers when dew is heavy  In crowded parts of the sky, labeling is hard to discern    Conclusion:  This Atlas is a tie for my favorite. I compare it to my S & T Sky Atlas 2000 (laminated). What it lacks in detail, it more than makes up for in portability. If S & T would make a laminated version of this (hint-hint) it would be a best seller.
B000UD08HW|5.0|there is nothing wrong with the concert. it is awesome. david gilmour rocks. the problem is that the video quality is only about standard dvd quality. if you are a david gilmour fan, by all means get this concert, but you will probably be just as happy with the dvd version vs. the extra cost of the blu-ray version. on my ps3, with the dvd up-convert, i bet a standard dvd would have looked just as good as the blu-ray of this concert. either way i highly recommend you get one version or the other of this concert. it is well worth it.
0307237702|2.0|Plenty of ideas but nothing to back it up with and the hope message wears thin when you realize how little this man has actually done in his lifetime.  Obama is the perfect candidate for the \\"Entitlement Generation\\" who earned nothing but wants it all right now.  I left a Vertigo U2 concert in 2005 feeling that Bono is a much more substantial individual and much more inspiration.  Yes, Bush has been a 87% failure and a destroyer of many things America but that doesn't mean this Pied Piper's message will lead anywhere but further destruction for a host of different reasons.  Let's \\"Hope\\" that we can do better than this empty soul.
0761925538|5.0|This book is an excellant resource for qualitative research.  It is written logically and is easy to follow.  In particular, the sections on case study design, how to address validity and reliability, and justification of methods are very helpful.  But it and plan to keep it as a reference.
B0010AN7Y0|2.0|Without including any spoilers to the film:    Just as the title to this review states, it was just simply painful to watch.  The movie is about a group of friends who have lost touch over the years and are invited out to the English countryside by one mate from the group for a New Years celebration reunion.  As things in life go, they find themselves having grown apart over the years, each 'friend' pursuing their seperate life and each friend having their own set of burdoning problems to deal with.    It's painful to watch because this movie is about a reunion, and we are met with awkward scene after awkward scene of each character battling their own demons that have plagued their after-we-all-lost-touch life.  And it's even more difficult to watch when things would get heated and characters would yell things \\"they didn't mean to say\\" about other characters while in their presence.    What's even more painful about watching the movie is listening to it.  The movie has one of the most annoying and predictable soundtracks making me wonder if the script was actually written around the songs themselves.  Every fresh scene we are met with a cliche \\"reminiscent\\" song that sums up the previous scene and can pretty much sum up any sort of 80's teen movie.    However, despite my unusually harsh review, the acting in the movie is absolutely brilliant.  Those who are a fan of Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, and the rest of that class's Cambridge Footlights cast will be pleased to see old favourites reuniting in this movie.  Being strictly familiar with Hugh Laurie's comic career, I was immensely impressed with his big scene (each character in the movie has their own poignant scene where they deal openly with whatever their particular conflict is), that showscases his ability in dramatic roles.  You sympathise with Emma Thompson's character and the way she is gets treated by her \\"friends\\" in a couple scenes.  Tony Slattery, while his character is completely annoying at first, he ends up giving a great performance.  And of course, Stephen Fry is simply great (and you really feel for him during those awkward scenes I mentioned earlier), but the conflict that his character is battling within this film is simply predictable; not to mention, once he does reveal his secret to the group, his speech on the topic becomes predictable, as if it was lifted from one of those after-school specials.    While I know this review will be met with rolling eyes, it is simply what I thought about the movie itself, not the actors (some of them which I'm a huge fan of).    It's just one of those movies I would have been better off Netflixing, as it doesn't even have any bonus material making it a worthwhile buy.
0739334085|2.0|I bought this book because of Obama's rise onto the National scene.  As a point of clarification, I am a centrist Republican.  I put that up front because I know that many Liberals will discount everything else I say & many hard-core Conservatives will ask why I even let Obama into my home?  At least that is the impression that I got from some of my friends whom I told that I read the book.  I believe when we close our minds, we become close-minded; profound, I know.    Obama is a great writer and speech maker.  This is evident in his book, 'Audacity OF Hope,' the title of which was borrowed from his Pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright who had a sermon named, 'Audacity TO Hope.'  I did not read Obama's previous book, 'Dreams from my Father.'  I presume this picks up where that left off.  In any case, it basically starts with his unsuccessful bid for a Illinois political seat and the humbling experience that it was, then goes through successful bids for local, state and then national office, ending in the middle of his 1st year as a US Senator from Illinois.    The book chronicles domestic political policy since the Reagan years; there is a paucity of foreign policy insight.  Obama paints nice pictures of why both sides of the many arguments that have ensued are right.  Reagan was right on this, but Clinton was right on that.  He even finds some correctness with the current President Bush's policies.  The only time I heard him definitively come down on one side or the other is when he was talking about \\"special interests\\" ruining Washington & how he was not taking any of their money!  But then the caveat came when he declared that unions represent the people therefore he did not consider that \\"special interest\\" money!  Hypocritical!    This is the feel good book of the year.  In his book, it almost seems as though everybody is right and everybody has good ideas.  I was really trying to get a sense of where Barak thought the country should be heading by what he thought of the past, but as I read the book, I kept on thinking of Rodney King's infamous line, \\"Can't we all just get along?\\"  Maybe that was the point of the book?  Maybe he is saying that it is time to heal and unite?  I hope so & I hope he is not just paying us lip service!
B000R7I3LY|3.0|It's probably not a fair comparison, but it is a favorable one, Sara Bereilles kind of reminds me of Fiona Apple on her breakout and breakthrough album \\"TIDAL.\\"  Lyrically, she's actually saying something.  Not as much, but she's saying something.  She draws a beautiful, complicated picture and holds your hand as she leads you through it.  The Fiona-Lite comparison comes in as she is a much easier, more upbeat, poppier pill to swallow, for now at least.  Where Fiona was certainly not holding your hand through her journey but wanted you to feel the pain she felt every step of the way.  You feel \\"Little Voice\\" in your toes and finger tips, and \\"Tidal\\" was a punch to the stomach.  Can't help but think the next time out the gate she'll have more to say and more freedom to say it.  But with all that, it's still good material and it's delivered with personality.  It makes you want more exploration.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|Private detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) becomes embroiled in L.A. water politics and falls for the daughter (Faye Dunaway) of a powerful but evil (you have no idea how evil unless you've seen the movie) developer (John Huston).  This is 70s nihilism at its best.  Roman Polanski shows us why he's worthy of being regarded as a great director no matter how much sub-standard product he turns out, and Nicholson shines in his physical prime.  Robert Townes demonstrates why he is regarded as a superlative screenwriter, although it is important to note that Polanski is responsible for the film's devastating conclusion.    Gittes operates in a world where it is essentially impossible to do good.  No matter how much he seems to be in command of a situation, there are always factors beyond his understanding and control that fundamentally alter the intended outcome of all his efforts.  Knowing this, is he a fool or a hero for acting as he does?  Or perhaps he is just a decent human being who tries to help when he can, trusting to the Fates that he will not cause too much harm.  For much of this film, you may wonder why it is called \\"Chinatown,\\" but when the final scene reveals the suitability of the title, it is a disturbing comment on the human condition.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|Have owned the Invicta Speedway for a while. In short, it is more about style than actual functionality:     1. The hours subdial is not part of timer, it only shows the 24-hr version of the actual time. Say, if it is 9:35pm, then the hand in the hours subdial will point to 21. So it doesn't keep track of the time elapsed and there is no way you can \\"reset\\" it.    2. As usual the Invicta watch suffers from misalignment in the dial and subdials. So the minute subdial is almost useless: There is no way you can exactly tell between like 3 and 4 minute or between 12 and 13 minutes.    If you really want a chronograph combined with style, choose the Seiko Men's Tachymeter, the blue one for eye-catching, while the black one for masculine.

B00132D808|5.0|I know people have been crapping a brick about this CD, and at first I kinda did too, but as I keep listening to it it is growing on me.  The musical elements are great. It isn't as hard as their first CD, but let's be honest here, if you think their first CD is \\"hard\\" you're terribly mistaken. If you want hard music then buy Slayer. They aren't the Beatles, nor are they completely different, but this is a good effort. I would recommended this CD. Specifically check out:    Track 6, 12, and 13    Don't PANIC everyone!!! Geez laweez . . .
B000UGG39Q|3.0|WHAT A WASTE of one of THE best vocalists of all time - they have the talent, and the right idea, BUT, they HAVE to either replace the sound mixer, producer, or WHOEVER let this out of the studio the way it is. It sounds as if it were recorded in a garbage can or cardboard box!! There is no clarity, no definition - sounds like 12 year olds put it together. I LOVE Phil Anselmo - when I can clearly tell when he is singing. I have heard some pretty poor recordings in my lifetime - as far as I am concerned, there is NO excuse for it any more. I PRAY they digitally remaster this and their first CD - THEN they might just get the following they need. PHIL!! COME BACK TO ME!!!
B00005JPLW|5.0|I don't know where this movie came from all of the sudden, but it is surprisingly good. I found out about it after it was out of the theaters and already on DVD. The action is fantastic and the special effects as well. The story sounds like a great fantasy epics that was made up by somebody just to make a movie out of it.<br /><br />I was curious though and did some checking to learn to my amazement that this movie is actually based on real historic events that happened millenniums ago in Ancient Greece.<br /><br />You won't like it, if you hate violence and bloodshed, because the movie has plenty of it. But then also, it wasn't pretty when the events actually happened in the real world.
B00000I8BX|5.0|Fear Factory is one of my favorite bands - and I am 52! I cannot go more than a few days without listening to one of their awesome CDs - this one is just as awesome as all the previous ones!! What I like more than anything, is that they are truly unique, and no other existing band is as smooth and together as this one. I met the drummer awhile back, and was amazed that he was FAR from a pompous jerk like some great musicians can be...very funny, interesting,and polite!!    I especially recommend FF for those who are just breaking in to this genre of music - they will not scare you off like some....
B0012Q94QW|4.0|You probably noticed by reading some of the other reviews that this movie is not very accurate in regards to history. So if you plan to go to the movie to learn something, do yourself the favor and do not go. You will be disappointed. The action is nice, but not spectacular. If you like the two things that I mentioned, you will be better off with the movie \\"300\\", which is a great movie and actually based on real historic events.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JPLW 300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />If you look at the movie at what it is, entertainment for the sake of entertainment, you will probably enjoy the movie. I did enjoy it and will also buy the DVD when it comes out. The story is about love and has a considerable amount of fantasy flair to it. People would probably have given better ratings, if the setting of the events would have been fictitious (other planet, millions of years ago etc.), because then there would it have been clear that the movie does not even attempt to reflect real history in any way.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|the show is good .The only thing i did not like was packaging  the dvds come in .        The button that hold the dvds in broke and i cant replace it or the box therefore i will try not to buy dvds in this type of box
B0000019PA|5.0|I finally bought the full In the Aeroplane Over The Sea album by Neutral Milk Hotel. I can't believe I waited so long to complete it. I mean, I've had a few of their songs, but I was afraid that the album in its entirety would come off as pretentious. After all, they are an indie-rock band of the nineties. Isn't pretention required? Thankfully not. I now see why many call it best album of the nineties. It's a sonic masterpiece. Bittersweet and heart wrenchingly beautiful. All eleven songs feed seamlessly into one another, connecting like a wonderful symphony. And together, each song takes on a wonderful new meaning and flavour that it loses on its own. Everyone should own this album, with the disclaimer that NMH's music is very similar to Elvis Costello: it can take multiple hearings to appreciate, or even like. A musical assault of the ears that grows on you to the point where it changes something deep inside.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|After reading the promo about this movie, I did not want to see it.  I figured it was another Catholic-bashing movie, and I am pretty tired of those.  I reluctantly watched it because there was nothing else on TV. For the next two hours, I was completely enthralled in this dynamic, intelligent, spectacularly thrilling movie!  When it was over, I wanted to watch it again, and again! The cast was perfect! The movie was positively spell-binding! The script was poetry! What a story!!  I have never been so utterly entertained in all my movie-going life!  I just learned about the comic book connection, but I don't really care about the comic books; I loved this movie.  This has to be the greatest sci-fi action thriller of all times! If you are on the fence about buying this film, I'm telling you that you will not be disappointed!  When this movie ended, all I could muster was a very loud, \\"WOW!\\" Awesome film!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutly a great DVD collection for the si-fi fan.  I purchased two copies, one for my grandson and one for me.  I have watched it twice and expect to watch is many more times.  Always seem to see something new each time.  Great series, too bad they only made one season.
0307387178|5.0|this was an incredible read. I think it's a plus for high schoolers to read as well as those who have a bit of open mindedness.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I suppose if you've never read Pride and Prejudice this may be a fine film (that's why I gave it two stars instead of just one), but it in NO way does any justice to Jane Austen's novel. Perhaps it's impossible to build the depth of character the way Austen does in a 2 hour movie, but it's because it was only 2 hours long that I was able to even sit through this movie. From the start I was sceptical of Kiera Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett, but in the end it wasn't her performance that disappointed - the whole movie was seriously lacking. Maybe Austen just can't be satisfied in 2 hours, but I was left thinking, That's it? What a sorry tribute to a classic.    This version is FAR inferior to the A&E miniseries (about 5 hours of Eliza and Mr. Darcy) which aired on Masterpiece Theatre and, I felt, illustrated the novel as beautifully as an on-screen adaptation can. If you'd like to see this classic on the screen, make time for the A&E version and forget this one.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|I bought this dvd to add to my collection of Owen Wilson films, and I had mixed expectations that I would like it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I did enjoy it, and I watched it 3 times consecutively before I picked anything else to watch.  I enjoyed the dynamic of the relationship of the brothers, the quest and the conclusion.  I don't want to reveal to much of the story for those who have not yet watched it, but I found the visuals breathtaking and the story uplifting.  Writing about it makes me want to watch it again.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|A bona-fide spectacle. Director Anthony Mann, better known at the time for his well-regarded Westerns with James Stewart ('Winchester '73', 1950; 'The Naked Spur', 1952; 'Bend of the River', 1953; 'The Far Country', 1954), Henry Fonda ('The Tin Star', 1957) and Gary Cooper ('Man of the West', 1958), put his best foot forward in this 1961 telling of the unification of Spain in the XIth Century, with Charlton Heston (lost half of my audience right there) at his heroic best in the title role, with Sohia Loren as Ximene, at her most enticing. The factual elements may be glossed over - what historic movie doesn't? But, to paraphrase William Randolph Hearst: \\"...publish the legend,\\" especially when it serves as good entertainment. Indeed not quite as masterful as director David Lean's two ('The Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'), but Ridley Scott - whose 'Kingdom of Heaven' in the Director's edition merits consideration as a contender - and others can well aspire to a similar degree of accomplishment as this.
159102594X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Joe Abercrombie takes the new trend of \\"epic\\" fantasy with thousands of characters, hundreds of viewpoints, and flat characterizations...and throws it right out the window.    If you enjoy cynical, humorous, character-driven stories, this book is for you. This book had me laughing out loud consistently with the clever ironies that Joe weaves into the point of views. Would recommend for anyone, especially those wanting a change of pace or witty, cynical fantasy.
0316067598|4.0|Absolutely amazing!  I could not be prouder to say that I am a natralized American.  I felt Marcas Latrells pain and anguish.  I only hope that he can find peace in his survival, knowing how important it was that the truth be told and not screwed up by the media.  I only hope Hollywood doesn't sensantionalize this in the movie version.
B000LPS4BG|4.0|Everyone knows this movie is a classic. Absolutely true. What i want to get into is the Blu-Ray transfer. To sum it up in one word: grainy. It's obvious that the transfer was straight from the original film negative. You see all the lines and pops that would have been present on screen when the movie originally came out in theaters. I'm positive there will eventually be a remastered version coming out but who knows when that will happen. It definitely needs a good digital clean up. Audio quality is also lacking. It is just standard Dolby 5.1. They could've at least made it PCM. Really, if you get this at a good price, there is no reason NOT to buy it. The picture isn't bad. It's just not up to par with other Blu's out there. Still a great addition to add to the collection.
0452289963|5.0|This book gives you the foundation to different ways of thinking.  It has opened my eyes to living in the now and forget about the past and do not focus your life on the future.  It is a wonderful book and it lifts my spirits up when I read it.

I liked it up to the last four quotes, \\"What are we going to do now?\\"                                    \\"Build\\"                                       \\"Build what?\\"                                        \\"The republic of Heaven!\\"    You would think from that they will have a forth book, showing how to build the Republic of Heaven. I wanted MORE!! I didn't get more! Phillip Pullman this is a cry for MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is an excellent movie, well worth anyone's time to watch it all.(about 6 hours) Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy is exceptionally handsome and convincing.  The only problem I have with the movie is that the eldest Miss Bennet is not at all beautiful as she is supposed to be.
B000O77RL4|4.0|Clearly Eastwood attempted to make an anti-war film equivalent to \\"All Quiet ON The Western Front\\" but he failed.  The film was intended to humanize the Japanese and was very politically correct since it showed the Japanese in a very positive light while showing the Americans as brutal.  The scene where the American soldiers shot the prisoners was totally out of context and clearly placed there to reinforce the usual Hollywood view of the American Military.  The film failed to show or even indicate any of the brutality or inhumanity shown by the Japanese to their prisoners or even civilians.  This was a sad film but very one-sided and even distorted since it failed to show the actual conduct of the Japanese outside of the futility of the Bushido code.  The Japanese soldiers were shown as reluctant soldiers who were actually being victimized by their leaders and the Bushido code, while the few views of the Americans showed them as murderers.<br /><br />I usually avoid all Hollywood films dealing with the military because they are always anti-military and anti-American military in particular and this film was no different.  It was well done from a techical viewpoint and for that reason I gave it four stars but if you have ever been in the American Military this is just another backhanded slap at soldiers.  It is an anti-war film but it never shows any context for the war or the consequences of not fighting.<br /><br />Actually this could be seen as an anti-anti-war film because it can be viewed as a lesson in siege warfare.  It is an excellent examination of the practical problems facing the commander of a fortress when put under siege.  It demonstrates that the commander can only last as long as his supplies and must be relieved from outside.  A failure to gain relief can only result in an erosion of morale and loss of effectiveness.  From the that perspective this was a good training film.<br /><br />But in the end this was just another Hollywood film that once agains shows that Hollywood believes war is an American invention and that all that is needed is talk and a few choruses of Kumbaya.believes war is an American invention and that all that is needed is talk and a few choruses of Kumbaya.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Since I'm not only a fraternity man, but I help start the chapter at my school, I totally relate to humor in this film.  We never did anything as extreme as what is presented in the film, but that's what Hollywood does.  They take things that are kinda interesting, beef them up, and entertain you for an hour and a half.  Will Ferrell is great, Vince Vaughn is hilarious, and Luke Wilson's subtle wit shines.  This is a must have for any movie collection!!!
B0010ZR160|5.0|I wanted to see this when it first began showing in the theater, but didn't get the chance.  So when it came out on dvd, I snatched it right away!  The story is amazing; you can picture the reality of each situation in your head.  It moves along at a great pace, surprises around every corner, and bravo to Casey Affleck!  I've already watched it 3 times and want to do so again!  Excellent!!!!

B00132D808|5.0|Panic's style has gone from a one liner, sarcastic tone to something more of everday stuff. Its really quite refreshing to hear a different side of them, or maybe its just the new side. Judging by some of the lyrics, the band is a little different, and they know that. In the end they are the same band, just with a little different style. Great album.

0586071113|4.0|\\"Prelude to Foundation\\" by Isaac Asimov     Prof. Asimov has a knack for telling a good story. The really interesting part of this is that it is written in 1980 or so, and talks a little about using computers. In some of his older stories, he mentions the 'slide rule guys' figuring stuff out. I suppose that my knowing what a slide rule is dates me some. It is also obvious that he did not write this for serial publication. He can put together a good book with some disparate magazine stories, but this is written differently. It would have been possible to serialize it, but it was not, that I know of.  In the end it turns out that robots are God.
B00132D808|3.0|I was very excited to hear that my beloved Panic! had been so eager to put out a new album so soon after I discovered the eccentric and refreshingly unique emo-esque band. I had been overjoyed about \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" right up until the moment when \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" was released as a single. Usually artists release a song as a single that can stand on its own and has enough \\"oomph\\" to take the rest of the album to the top of the sales charts regardless of its lackluster middle tracks.    Unfortunately, the luster that once made Panic! stand out is gone along with their exclamation point. I can enjoy music for the sake of its complexities and dexterity, but I miss the old Panic! more than I can acurrately portray. They had such a unique feel to them...a little bit crazy, a little bit emo, a little bit vaudville, a little bit techno, a little bit accoustic...a little goes a long way. However, in the case of their newest album, a little is not going to be enough to make me run out and buy it.    Instead, I plan to purchase the tracks individually, only harvesting the somewhat decent songs that I won't simply skip over if I went out to purchase the full album.    If it was any other band that already had a pop/rock/alternative feel to it, then fine. I'd love it. But they set the bar so high with their last album, they weren't able to reach those heights again.    I can only hope that they relocate some of that immature insanity that drove them to the top last time, and come up with a 3rd album that can deliver just a dash of Panic!
B000TUXL2A|5.0|So many negative reviews and comments about this CD.  Yes, it's different from earlier works of his.  But different doesn't necessarily mean bad.  If you're accepting only a similar sound to a previous work, you shouldn't buy this CD.  This CD definitely has its own sound.  It is not a \\"rocking - turn up the volume\\" CD.  It's a great CD simply to play.  Perhaps it is the slightly mellowing Knopfler that turns away the hard-core rockers.  Too bad if so.      I readily admit my first couple of plays through this CD were met with skepticism, as the songs and mood represented a change from earlier solo efforts.  Being a huge fan of Sailing to Philadelphia and Shangri-La, I was hoping for more of the same, and took a step back at first.  That said, I took the CD to my car to give it a solid week of listening while driving to/from work.  If I wasn't going to like it, a week's listening would prove the point.  That was months ago and it's still in the car.    I wouldn't expect anyone to stand up and claim to like every song on this CD, and indeed there are a few I don't care for.  But how many CD's can make a claim that every song is great?  Music strikes everyone in a unique way.  If you are one of the people who borrowed this for one listen or two and gave up on it, I recommend you try again.  Listen to it more than just a couple of times, and I would guess you'll come away with an appreciation for a lot of what's on this CD.  I found many songs that not only grew on me, I can listen to them again and again as with previous Knopfler works.  And there is plenty of excellent guitar work throughout this CD, both electric and acoustic.  My preferences:    Behind with the Rent - to me this is vintage Knopfler.  Outstanding music, great guitar, great story, and my personal favorite.      Punish the Monkey - the most rocking song on the CD, and worthy of increased volume.  A fun listen.  Possibly Enron's theme song (belated).    Madame Geneva's - a place we've all been, keepingdemons away.  The refrain will stick with you long after the song stops.    In the Sky - an acoustic gem.  I continue to like this song more as I hear it.  And a bit of sax adds an interesting sound to the ending.    True Love Will Never Fade - A bit of the \\"5:15 am\\" format from Shangri-La, as the song starts out quiet with not much more than Mark and his guitar and picks up from there.  It's another song that sticks with you.    There are some great new sounds on a few songs.  The Scaffolder's Wife has the unmistakable sound of Knopfler guitar, but adds a flute.  I realize this might seem like a strange combination, but it works well.  The Secondary Waltz is a sound all to itself, with an accordian waltz track throughout.  The words bring some of us older folks back to the days of our youth, hesitant to learn dancing in the gym where (gasp) we might have to touch girls.  Even my kids like to sing along with this song.    Overall, I've really grown to like this CD and am glad I have it.  Yes, it's somewhat different for Mark Knopfler music.  And yes, it's great.  Just give it a chance.
0316166685|5.0|This novel is written from the point of view of the victim of a rape and murder.  She looks down from heaven and watches how her family deals with her death.  The novel is unique in its perspective.  The story is very well written and amazingly touching.
B00005MP58|5.0|I really liked this film.  Believing and trusting,just because the person appears to have all the information,names and has a wholesome appears doesn't mean he is honest. The cunning manipulation of facts was interesting.  Things arn't always what they seem.   It is worth watching
006085880X|4.0|Two teenagers are linked from birth by their families.  When Emily decides she wants to die, Chris cannot say no because he wants her to be happy.  I love the way Picoult writes and it must be a good book because I am still thinking about it, but I have to say that it left me feeling...sad.  I knew what I was getting into and yet still, I am disappointed that it had to turn out that way.  I was frustrated with Emily because she was narrow-minded and practically obsessed with herself in an oblique way.  I would guess my problem is I really liked Chris and his mother and Emily's father and so I was sad to see it turn out the way life so often does: sadly.
B00005JPSM|5.0|This was a nice family film. Death is a reality and for some hard to explain or face. This film shared some of the difficulties of adjustment.  Both adult and child learned to give and take and forged a new family unit.

B0011NVC9I|5.0|It is fascinating to see how many viewers are still invested in this story. Having read the epic poem myself I was impressed by this cinematic retelling. I didn't see it in the theater, so my review is of the director's cut. It is funny how some reviewers write about the destruction, or dishonor that this version does to the classic. I disagree. This postmodern version of the story makes explicit everything that is implicit in the actual text. The sins of the father theme is elevated to the foreground of the narrative. The flawed character of the hero is very well defined and serves the purpose of the story, illuminating the actual text for me. The seductive qualities of Grendel's mother were well served by the figure of the very sexy Jolie. The pathetic and sympathetic portrayal of Grendel was the best part. The CGI was great except for the facial expressions. They were a bit restrained, almost wooden. It is very much like Miller's 300. I think it would have been better had there been live actors mixed in with the CGI like in 300. It reinvigorates an overblown folktale, breathing human frailty into its monolithic heroic frame - I loved it!
B000002UB6|5.0|Turning vinyl into compact discs - Thank You! All Beatles Albums are classics. Let It Be captures their finest sounds.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|This is not a typical Will Smith movie.  It has minimal action and Will Smith's \\"charm\\" and humor are not showcased.  Instead, the movie highlights Will's excellent acting abilities by focusing on a lonely man who has somewhat lost his mind but still clings to the hope of \\"fixing\\" things.    The movie is dark and focuses too much on Will Smith to carry the entire film.  There are a lot of unaswered questions and the plot moral is unclear.  I felt as though a lot seemed to be missing in the version I watched (the theatrical version).  You get the feeling that the movie was more of a highlight of some of the better scenes with the rest cut out, creating large gaps in the story progression.    \\"I Am Legend\\" is worth watching but I think that it's predecessor \\"The Omega Man\\" is a better movie.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Scheherazade is performed a LOT. Fritz Reiner was well-aware of this fact in 1960 when he conceived this historic recording. As a consequence, he fostered no desire to yield just another run-of-the-mill performance. Here's a blurp from the notes which explains his subsequent efforts more fully:<br /><br />\\"Some weeks before the actual recording was made, most of the existing recordings of the music were studied, re-studied, judged and re-judged. The best were very good, but short of that perfection for which all mortals strive. One version reveled in buttery sound and not always accurate execution; another proferred razor-sharp execution and equally ear-rending decibel content; still a third beckoned you from afar with a 'concert-hall' pickup, and so it went. To capture the Arabian temptress in all her glittering changes was not a simple task...<br /><br />Once each of the facets of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was heard [referring to the lengthy orchestra practice sessions], music making was in order. During the morning session the first two movements were recorded, the last two during the afternoon period. Throughout the six hours required, there was constant exhortation by Dr. Reiner to the men in the orchestra 'to play with glow, not perspiration'. The performance had to be supple and sensuous, the sound alternately to shimmer and stun, with clarity in its definition, sonority and intensity in its climaxes.\\"<br /><br />Folks, this is about as perfect as it's ever going to get.<br /><br />Just to follow up, the 1956 recording of Stravinsky's \\"Song of the Nightingale\\" is also quite good and is a piece that, in this level of quality, isn't all that easy to find. And it's also a perfect second, complementary piece to Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Scheherazade\\".<br /><br />This is an ADD recording/CD.<br /><br />A must-have for collectors and a superb choice for all others.
6304030983|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Some parts are extremely funny. But it's mostly serious in a cool way. It's a very fun movie to see.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|This is my personal opinion. I looked and looked when I was buying this film and never saw that it was not in other languages.     I bought it as a gift for somebody who wanted to see it in French. This person is a fan.     I would not say that the film details depicted on the web ad are misleading, but it does not have all the info.     I would have loved to know that before buying it...     So, only English... and not subtitles in other languages!    Add it to your details, please!
B000B8QG22|5.0|I have probably watched this movie more than 20 times, and still laugh as though it was the first time watchin it. A story about a disc jocky in VietNam doing his best to entertain soldiers throughout while walking a fine line of what is authorized by his command.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|As far as King-books-to-film-adaptations go this one wasn't so bad but wasn't so good, either.  I'm right in the middle of the fence on this one.  As I watched The Mist I was mostly entertained UNTIL the AWFULLY STUPID ending.  It has to rate among the MOST anticlimactic endings in film history.  But, maybe that was the point.  I, for one, HATED the ending as did my housemates.  I would have preferred a more ambiguous ending, as the novella had but I digress.  The creature design was adequately creepy and strange enough.  The characters overacted when they didn't need to.  They also did incredibly dumb things at times but I guess panic can cause people to do the dumbest things.  Aside from the end, another big gripe I had with the film was the lighting.  Everyone is trapped in a supermarket and there's no electricity at night yet the whole store is \\"lit up\\" by the studio set lights which REALLY killed the tension and atmosphere, in my opinion.  The director should have relied more on candlelight or flashlights to set the lighting mood, not GLARING overhead \\"light spots\\" shining down.  Also, harking back to the dumb things people do when they are scared, did it make any sense when the bugs started hitting the glass windows and, naturally, everyone freaks out about it BUT then they all just traipse on over to the glass holding up huge lanterns, large spotlights, all shining out the windows attracting more bugs and even larger flying creatures that feed on the smaller bugs and eventually break a large window, fly in and wreck the store.  Anyway, I'd like to see the B&W version but NOTHING can redeem the HORRIBLE ENDING.  It was just so shallow and insulting.  But, you be the judge.
B000002UB3|5.0|In 1969,without really knowing it The Beatles were about to split but before they released two albums \\"Abbey Road\\"that same year and \\"Let It Be\\" in 1970.Abbey Road was named after the recording studio were they recorded their albums and it was in fact recorded after the Let It Be sessions but it was released before that album came out,its awkward but that`s how it is.For this album they knew they weren`t a band like they used to,but unlike Let It Be for this album they putted their differents aside in order to make a great album,which they exactly did.Its not credited to be as good as it really is,but its a superior album(at least better than most band`s material that`s for sure)and some consider it the best.Its tricky to choose the best album as they have many unforgettable classics and great albums,but this one has each musicians focusing on the music and playing and writting very well(even Ringo wrote a song on this album and its great).<br /><br />If you compare Let It Be to Abbey Road there is a big difference between the two as anyone with sense will say Abbey is superior,but in fact Let It Be is often said to be the filming of the breakup of the band and it was recorded before Abbey Road.Yet for this album you can`t really tell that as they sound so great and they were focused to make of this a great album,and what a masterpiece did it become!Still after doing Let It Be,its impressive how they managed to work back as a unit again,or at least make it feel like,anyone who listened to Let It Be will understand me.If not then you learned something!Still for this one,each Beatles did their stuff as they wanted(unlike on Let It Be when Paul told George exactly what to play and pitty George doing what he had to)and the result is impressive while at this point of their career it probably shouldn`t have.<br /><br />There are many rock`n`roll songs on Abbey Road like the great opening track that is \\"Come Togheter\\" or George`s \\"I Want You(She`s So Heavy)\\" and its for the better,but there still are some of those fun pop songs such as \\"Maxwell`s Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Mean Mustard\\" that you can still enjoy.George has a more important presence on the album than on previous ones,his guitar playing is seemingly better and his songs and lyrics are great.Even Ringo wrote a song for the album,\\"Octopus`s Garden\\"(inspired by what someone told him,that octopuses decorate the front of their house,just like a garden)and its done really well,he did a very good song,not as good as the other three Beatles but still very good and worth being on the album.Trow in a couple of ballads such as the amazing \\"Here Comes The Sun\\"(wich is credited for being the best love some of all time,Elvis Presley himself said so along with a few others)and the excellent \\"Something\\"(both written by George!)which are two of the world`s best ballad,and you`ve got Abbey Road one of the greatest albums of all time(along with a few other Beatles album rightfully deserving so such as Rubber Soul,Revolver and others).<br /><br />See there is more about this album than the iconic cover it has!Actually speaking of the cover it was quite controversial as a DJ in the States(U.S)started rumours that Paul McCartney`s death.The thing is the cover had a few signs that pointing towards his death,tought it was not intended on purpose to.Those signs were Paul walking on the street(on the cover)without shoes on,which is appearently a mafia sign of death!There`s more the white car`s plate at the middle left of the cover reads \\"\\"28IF\\" wich meant to the belivers that Paul would be 28 if he wasn`t dead!Also Ringo wore a black suit wich meant he was the undertaker,you see all those kinds of things(those are the ones I know)and The Beatles knew it was all rumors but how to make them understand Paul was still alive?Anyway that is the dark story behind the cover with all those rumors,quite interresting but not true of course!<br /><br />The songs are pretty much all great,tought im not really a fanof Paul`s \\"Her Majesty\\" who at only 22 seconds is not exactly `The best thing ever`(its not bad but its way,way,WAY too short!To me the highlights of the album are \\"Come Togheter\\" a strong Lennon song and the impressive at 7:47 or so minutes(a Beatles epic!Might be the only one they did)\\"I Want You(She`s So Heavy)\\",\\"Here Comes The Sun\\",\\"Polythene Pam\\" and a few others.Really its a collection of great songs put togheter.I think what makes Abbey Road so great is that The Beatles have matured as persons and as artist wich allowed them to do terrific stuff .On the second half of the album it seems to be a medley and it surprisingly fits,I don`t know if that`s what it was supposed to be but that`s what many fans think anyway.\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" is in fact a direct reference to the record industry and how The Beatles felt about it,just tought I`d say that.There are other good songs I haven`t mentionned yet such as \\"Oh!Darling\\"(Paul does a good job but I think it might have fitted John`s style more) and \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\" but really each song are good and have something different,special and unique.Oh and Ringo even does a drum solo on \\"In The End\\" as he felt pressure from other drummers who did and didn`t take him too seriously as a drummer,well considering all I hear before of other drummers I don`t think that this little 10 second solo part will scare them but its certainly nice.<br /><br />What`s left to say?Well first this might be a little long review but had a lot to say about this great album and I couldn`t do it any shorter.This NEEDS to be in your collection,if you like The Beatles or rock then you need this,really.If you don`t trust or belive me there are plenty of reviewers who can say the same thing to you.Five stars the very least,its that good and you won`t regret it it has great songs,beautifull songs,rocking songs not to mantion great playing and absolutely terrific writtings.Its an essential album and one of The Beatles`s best album in my opinion no matter what you say it won`t make me change my opinion.I hope you will buy this album if you don`t already have it.at only 22 seconds is not exactly `The best thing ever`(its not bad

B00005NC66|3.0|I was actually looking forward to watching \\"Breathless\\" but it was certainly a disappointment for me.  This is the story of a man who is going nowhere and who doesn't seem to care too much about what happens along the way.  Yes, he had momentary interests and vague notions of where he would like to be tommorrow and maybe as far into the future as next week.  However, we are given 90 minutes to marvel at his chain-smoking, car-stealing, pick-pocketing self absorbed life.  He has friends in the underworld who show up on occassion and he has a string of girl friends for whom he shows up on occassion.  No one is immune to his manipulation; not even the poor cab driver who got stiffed for the fare.  I got tired of his pointless, hedonistic thievery (not to mention murder).      This movie is highly rated so the problem may well be me.  Maybe it's meant to portray a new Lost Generation in Europe but all the more reason to pity the once great continent.  It may be a brilliant look at a lone wolf's inability to exist in modern society but why empathize with a person who goes to excessive means to avoid assimulating?  This is one of those movies where the dialogue doesn't fit the action.  Murder, thievery, manipulation all takes place with a script that sounds like a college sophomore's intellectual efforts to seduce a coed.  I'm not sure I'm cut out for Godard.  I guess that's what I learned from \\"Breathless\\".
B00003CX9E|4.0|[[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />A Professor and movie buff at my place of work and I got into a conversation about Orson Welles. Asking me if I ever seen the movie Citizen Kane I replied although I knew of the movie I did'nt recall ever seeing it. So I purchased it. Considered by many as the greatest movie ever made it did not disappoint. The acting was terrific. The camera angles and shots were for the time in a league of their own. Making a movie based on the lastword of a dying man (rosebud) and keeping you the movie goer watching until the end just to find out what he meant was also amazing.<br />To bad we do not see Hollywood put more of these types of movies out.<br />To find the best that Hollywood has to offer I believe you must look to it's past.This movie is an shining example of that.<br />Well worth the purchase price and a fine addition to any movie collection.

It's organized by cookie type and has wonderful pictures that let you see what things are supposed to look like.  :-)      Some of the recipes I do recognize from magazines/holiday issues, but I love that they have been compiled into a solid book that I can keep at hand and not have to dig through a pile of magazines or papers to find.      So far, everything is delicious!

B000002Q7Y|2.0|If you listen to this album without knowing it is Kansas, it's an alright piece of 80's rock. However, it is one of the worst albums Kansas ever made (the two studio efforts that followed are the only ones worse).  1983's Drastic Measures (which wasn't particularly good either, but had some high points) was the last Kansas album before they disbanded. Walsh reformed the group in 1986 with a different lineup and, glaringly, without Livgren and his songs.  If you were to make a list of the top 15 best Kansas songs and the bottom 15 worst Kansas songs, very few, if any, Walsh written songs would make the top 15 and, likely, the bottom 15 would be filled with songs he penned. While Walsh did surprisingly well writing for Power, it's still not good enough to recapture the traditional Kansas sound. In other words, the album just doesn't sound like Kansas. And I think the concept of Kansas would have been better off had Walsh and company given their \\"new\\" band a different name.  Finally, the song Three Pretenders is a very low blow to Livgren, Hope and Elefante and completely unnecessary. I can't stand this song at all because Livgren and Hope are so important to the history of Kansas and to stab them in the back like this on an album with the name Kansas on the cover makes me sick.  Bottom line: not bad for the 80's, not good for Kansas.
0618680004|5.0|What do you need to know about this book? Richard Dawkins doesn't like religion, and he's good at saying it. He stays away from baseless rants, and he backs up everything he says, he's not at all apologetic, and he thinks indoctrinating children with religion is immoral. What's not to like? If your looking for a critical examination of religion then you probably know what you are getting into. He sticks pretty closely to the science while he examines \\"The God Hypothesis\\", but he more than manages to keep things interesting. He also plays the social consequences angle, and he does so pretty well. My description doesn't do it justice. Its a great book and a comprehensive disassembling of religion, read it!

1570628033|5.0|\\"Siddhartha\\" offers up numerous aphorisms for contemplation, and each reader takes away one or two nuggets that seem to drive home a point of particular relevance in that individual's life. Whether Easterner or Westerner, Buddhist or Christian, these aphorisms largely transcend particular organized religions and speak to the human condition generally. It is therefore irrelevant whether Hesse's Siddhartha was correctly modeled after Buddha.<br /><br />For this reader (Rosner translation), it's all about being \\"of the moment\\". The Chinese have a saying, paraphrased as \\"you can never set foot in the same stream twice.\\" Absolutely true. \\"Past\\" and \\"Future\\" are purely intellectual constructs, and \\"Time\\", even when defined as elegantly as by the likes of Einstein, remains the purely human invention of a particular species on a particular planet. While the sum total of Siddhartha's approach to living is the result of all of his life perceptions and actions, he asks us to stop fixating on the future (the material goals of the merchant, the potentially endless search for wisdom through others - an inherently flawed concept - even the fruitless attempt to hold onto offspring who have developed their own aspirations and value system) but rather, to slow down and use not just our body (as Siddartha did with Kamala) but also our mind and heart to totally connect with our surroundings - the person whose eyes we make contact with or whose voice we hear; the smell, colors and temperature around us; even the ugliness of the actions of others; and to stop fighting our desire to \\"move things along\\", for, like the river, they will move us along, if we let them, and we can savor the ride by being a force of less resistance.<br /><br />Be open to the moment as much as humanly possible, Siddhartha suggests, and you will feel the pulse of eternity and your minute role in it. Only then can you fathom the immateriality of the past and the folly of playing to the future. Connect with your fellow human being, being with him or her in the moment, and let your immersion in the river of humankind carry your earthly vessel to a more sublime destination. In this, all individual religions unite; in this, all human preoccupations must give way; in this, \\"progress\\" may be achieved through a radically different human definition.<br /><br />Not easily done by we humans, but genuinely worthy of consideration., being with him or her in the moment, and let your immersion in the river of humankind carry your earthly vessel to a more sublime destination.

Yet, when they come forward to solo, you are aware that each is a polished and creative performer! More! Please!   I save the best for last.   The new songs written by Kazuo Ishiguro and Jim Tomlinson are very special. They are not just the same old love songs. Yes, each one includes love as a component, but, with a humorous \\"twist\\". Artists create many mediocre pieces on the way to that ONE masterpiece, but to write FOUR superb songs for this album, is a creative blessing.  Turn down the lights; sit back; enjoy!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|One way that you can tell this movie is both and independent movie and a foreign film is that the songs are performed straight through, are not shortened and the camera stays on the performers. It creates an amazing intimacy and power and really allows one to see the energy between the two main characters. Glen Hansard's   passion while singing is wonderful. It's a quiet movie about love, loneliness and music. The two leads (non-actors both) give convincing performances. I believed they were the people they were playing. It's a happy, sad and touching movie.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I found the \\"clean-up\\" of the original series very well done. The new  images of the Enterprise really bring the series up to date. Im hoping  that someone continues with restoration of the remaing seasons in some form  or add the new images to standard DVD for season two and three.     I have the original first issue DVDs and still watch them. The added HD  special features are very informative and worth owning both versions. You  can still purchase an HD player at a very low price.  Get this combo before they are all sold out and you wont regret it.
B000XFVIMQ|2.0|I bought this just to have all three. James Cameron set the benchmark which has never been exceeded in sci-fi with Aliens, and T2 and T1 we're very well done too. This was made without the eye for detail and plot consistancy one unfortunately expects with the bulk of todays movies, and this one is no exception.
B0001I55OC|3.0|This 2003 silver screen take on Michael Crichton's book of the same name begins with the mysterious and sudden appearance of a man in medeival dress, literally from out of the Dark Ages into the modern Soutwestern US where he collapses on a desert highway and is driven to a hospital by a passerby named Baker(Richard Donner) where he dies, and his body is signed out of the hospital by co-worker Frank Gordon(Neal McDonough). In due time, we will find the answer to why the dead man's organs and bone structure fail to properly align in the X-Ray photos. We learn his name was Vincent Taub (Jayson Merrill).    Meanwhile, in an area of France known as Castlegard, archeology students and their Scottish professor, E.A. Johnston(Billy Connolly)are studying the ruins of a 14th century site. American-born Chris Johnston (Paul Walker) displays an occasional awkwardness in assisting his father as he teaches. We learn that the younger  Johnston is there not only to visit his father, but also to woo his father's pretty assistant, Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor)--an undertaking his father discourages because he knows from personal experience that relationships between people of dissimilar interests tend to fail.   What does hold Chris' interest is his friendship with the other Scottish academic, Andre Mareck (charismatically played by Gerard Butler).   When Professor Johnston mysteriously disappears, physicist Steven Kramer (Matt Craven) finds evidence that the Professor has traveled back in time and is trapped there, Chris, Kate, Andre, Steven, and Francois Dontalle (Rossif Sutherland), travel to the International Technical Center in New Mexico, where Chris, Kate,Andre, Frank, Francois, and two of Frank's fellow ex-marines (Patrick Sabongui, and Mike Chute), step on the lab's time machine after being adequately prepped for their journey, and courtesy of a physicist with rather dubious intentions named Robert Doniger (David Thewlis)who collaborated with Professor Johnston on various projects, are transported back to 1357 Castlegard.    Complications in bringing the time travelers home stem from their being plunked into the middle of the Hundred Years' War on one end, and because of the explosion of a modern weapon that should not have gone back in time causing damage to the machine on the other. The conflicts of interest between Doniger and Kramer add to the problems as well.   Two of the time travelers are killed within minutes of their arrival; another is lost during an encounter with the arrogant Lord Oliver(Michael Sheen).   Soon, they find the Professor, but Mareck's encounter with Lady Clare (Anna Friel), the sister of French General Lord Arnaut (Lambert Wilson), changes both his destiny and hers.    Another encounter with Sir William De Kere(Marton Csokas), who  is intriguingly familiar with the group's history, makes the journey even more perilous.   Chris is able to assist Kate when she uses her archeological skills to turn the tide of events on the night of the siege of Castlegard. For him, history has truly come alive, and happily, he is able to share this with the woman he loves.   However this film may be panned by others, I found it to be an intriguing bit of sci-fi which evokes questions about loyalty, how far we would go on behalf of those we care about, and what we would do to change the bleakest situations in our favor.
0452289963|5.0|This book is, at a bare minimum, potentially life changing in nature.  It is one of the best spiritual books that I have ever read.  The author writes in a way that brings spirituality to everyone in an understandable manner.  It is mandatory reading for anyone who wants and is ready for real spiritual enlightenment.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Although I found the first book of the series a little immature in both writing style and structure, it was an enthralling book nonetheless... the second book, Eldest, was in my opinion phenomenal.  So, as you can imagine, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this movie since the news came out (a couple years before) that Eragon would be adapted for the big screen.<br /><br />What a disappointment!  Unlike the mini series adaptation of Earthsea, this adaptation at least has more than a marginal resemblance to the book upon which it was based.  However, the acting is poor, the scripting is poor, and even the special effects are a disappointment (and would have been even ten years ago).  The plot, though in many ways it resembles that of the book, was different enough that the story had a very different vibe and message (well, if the film had a message at all); further, there were substantial enough changes (I will not get into them for the sake of those who have not yet read the book) that there is now no chance that there could be a sequel based even remotely closely on Eldest.<br /><br />I could list out all my specific complaints, but I won't, because there is no point to that.  Just know that if you enjoyed the books, as I have, that you will almost certainly find this movie not just disappointing, but saddening.  It has a different feel and theme, it is destroyed by bad acting, and the plot is different enough that the intrigue in Eldest will never make it to the big screen, even if they do produce a sequel.
B00006M183|5.0|Great album, great songs, very happy with purchase.
B00133KFGW|5.0|All I can say is wow, what an awesome film. Great acting all around, great music, great story. A movie you want to watch over and over again. The ending can seem a little open-ended like you want to see more of a conclusion, but at the same time it seems very appropriate when the main plot of the film is for August (Evan) to have his music bring his parents to him. This movie is almost a new take on Charles Dickens Oliver Twist and I can't highly reccommend this film enough. A great movie for the whole family.
B000003TA4|5.0|We all know this album is amazing we are still listening and talking about it today.  The songs are great and these days Nirvana is the only grunge rock band still worth listening to as Soundgarden and Pearl Jam went soft and release simply bad music now.  Hail Nirvana and Nevermind the rest.
0143038419|1.0|I really hesitate to write a review for this book, much less admit I read it.  I consider it sort of \\"slumming,\\" as if I was caught rubber-necking with all the others to see what the fuss was about...  When I run into people that talk about this book, and how much they enjoyed it, I feel a burst of superiority, a sort of self-righteous pride, and I secretly hold it against them for their high opinions.  I don't like feeling that way--but this is one of those books that is beyond awful.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|well.. what can watching a movie do? but this is a must. In order to change the world, the society we live in, we must know what the reality is.
0553805460|4.0|I think Jordan is sending all of us a message here.  Wall Street \\"people\\" are morons and there is absolutely no point in us investing our savings and \\"retirement\\" funds with these people.  They will, ultimately, be stolen by the greedy \\"stock experts\\" on the street.  I think this is a great book that reminds us that we are responsible for our own investing and that the brokers are merely salespeople looking out for their own hookers.  Beware anyone trying to sell you an investment.  I do wish he would have included some pictures of Nadine though.  Get it from the library and save your cash.
0143038419|5.0|Through this delectable stockpile of quality writing, Gilbert shares with us her one year journey across Italy, India, and Indonesia.  She leaves in hopes of collecting and re-connecting with herself after suffering through an agonizing divorce, a painful rebound relationship, and a devastating depression.  Along the way she meets the most intersting people and makes an abundance of unlikely friends.  Focusing on a different aspect of her nature in each country, (eating in Italy, praying in India, and learning to love again in Indonesia) we journey with her as she slowly but surely heals her wounds and finds herself again.<br /><br />The quality of her writing alone makes this book worth reading.  At times I laughed out loud so hard that I drew attention to myself.  Other times I was gripping the book with white knuckles, aching to find out what was going to happen next.  Gilbert ties a rope around your waist and lures you right into the story as if your trotting along the streets of Rome and the beaches of Indonesia right next to her.<br /><br />This is NOT a book about God.  This is NOT a book about depression.  And most importantly, this book is NOT self-absorbed and bratty like so many other reviewers unfortunately claim it to be.  This is a book that everyone can relate to on some level.  It is a book about struggling through one of the most difficult times in your life and somehow managing to find the strength to pick yourself up off the floor and heal.  I have passed this book along to countless people, all who thanked my profusely for sharing it with them.  You absolutely must read this book.  One of the best I've ever read.
B0009ML238|5.0|Is CM (Circus Maximus) a DT (Dream Theater) knock-off band? Definitely not! As Snow Leopard already pointed out: \\"However \\"dreamified\\" their sound might be, there is still a Norwegian backdrop of sheer metal mania in it that Dream Theater has not ever boasted of. As such, this album might be too \\"metal\\" for some Dream Theater fans.\\"  DT is more diverse with a lot more influences (for instance Jazz) than CM. Yes, there are DT influences, but I think this is rather positive than negative. After all, Petrucci and Co. (DT) are (still) the prog metal gods. And yes, there are even DT/SX (Symphony X) sounding riffs and soli, but they're not copies as some people here say, they're just influences. (R. Evans Martin, pick one riff out of Redemption's The Fullness of Time - which I like a lot myself, but they're not that innovative - and within an hour I will find you at least three bands that use a very similar to almost identical riff) I'm very familiar with both DT and SX. I own all of their albums and I can tell after one to three seconds of listening to a song which one it is. I haven't found an exact copy of any DT or SX riff or solo yet. If CM is a DT/SX rip-off, then most bands out there are much worse rip-offs of each other.  The similarities are mainly the excellent musicianship and the ability to create songs that are complex (with lots of virtuosic playing, non-repetitive, lots of time signature/key changes, etc.), innovative, diverse (mixture of different music styles) and beautiful at the same time, which is what prog metal should be...like an audible \\"Memento\\", a musical thriller that grabs you from the first moment and won't let go until the last note has faded away, an extremely suspenseful and complex story told by notes (one excellent example of prog metal as good as it gets: DT's [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]])...    And this leads me to another thing that bugs me a lot: Often times I hear people complaining about the alleged \\"wankery\\" of bands like DT. This so-called \\"wankery\\" is (if it's good \\"wankery\\") supposed to be part of any decent prog metal album (or any progressive music style album) because it constitutes the \\"complex/virtuosic playing\\" part of the definition of progressive metal. People who can't deal with the complexity shouldn't be listening to prog metal; they should try power metal instead...    And this - eventually...after all this prog philosophy - leads to my actual review of this album. I can't say much more than what Snow Leopard (who IMO wrote the best review) already mentioned, except for this: If you'd like to know about the band's potential, listen to any song but Glory Of The Empire, since this is not a prog metal song; it's nice, but it's power metal, not prog (except for the solo, not a lot of virtuoso playing and no complexity here). Alive wouldn't be a very good pick either. Instead, I suggest you try the opener Sin, the instrumental Biosfear and the title track The 1St Chapter.
0440237688|3.0|Ok, so I just finished the book, and have been reading all of the reviews on  here. Let me explain my take on it.    It seems like the majority of the people say it is very boring.  Really?  I read it in two days!  It opens up and is very exciting, she creates a sense of something is going on.  You don't know what it is, and then the story unfolds.  When at the Ceremony of Twelves he is skipped, my heart skipped a beat too!  Near the end when he realizes what must be done, I'm in there rooting for him!  Go Jonas!!  Now for the negative.  The middle did go slow, and was kind of weird how he receives the memories.  The emotions that come across are very real, but as far as action in the story, it does go slow.  Also, the whole stirrings thing could have been dealt with differently.  Actually, the whole stirrings thing was ok, I suppose, but getting to that point by washing naked people was completely inappropriate, and other ways could have been more effective in introducing puberty.   People complain about it being boring - deathly boring!!  THAT IS THE POINT!!  The author is trying to show us that being the same - sameness - is bad.  We are individuals, and God made us unique the way we are.  Of course, that reasoning can be taken to extreme too.  The theme of euthanasia  - I took it as a warning.  I don't know if you realize it or not, but our world is heading that way.  Was it worth a read - yes.  Worth a read for young kids or even middle school - uhh - parents you decide.
