B002MQYOFW|5.0|I became so emotionally involved in this book... i couldn't put it down. Also a huge bonus that my 13-year-old daughter and i could read it simultaneously on our kindles and discuss it. such a thought-provoking story! can't wait to begin book 2... right now!
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|looks great but caused my kindle to glitch up even when I wasn't using it please fix and then it would be great
B004SBX112|1.0|App worked just fine before this update. Now it wont even open. Now thats what I call ad free! Please fix or advise.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce is really hitting it home with this one... home everywhere. I can't think of a single person who isn't affected by some of the concepts in this album... economic hardships, unemployment, etc. He's taken his story-telling to a new level with this very real and very powerful album. I admire his poise in the poetry and lyrics, standing tall and saying what he truly feels. The music is also incredibly moving, a big sound that is a perfect background for the even bigger words.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|After latest update, app wont open. Paid for ad free. Guess I got that, and less. Worked before the update.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Once that I had got it, it kept locking up my tablet, it crashes, and sometimes i have to reset my tablet. Even if I do reset my tablet, it never works.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I don't know why people are complaining about the size. It moves to the SD card just fine and is less than 500kb.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This is the worst most poorly designed app! NO WIDGETS, HUGE 46MB SIZE! If you like bulky useless garbage you'll love this app. I was tired of having extra space on my SD card, and I was looking for a weather app that not only took a long time to open and refresh, but one that also didn't have all those annoying features and options that made it easy to use. This is complete crap, it's just what I needed to make my EVO 3D seem bulky and boring just like the old phones of the late 90s. Developer, you have officially created beautiful garbage, why don't you go back to developing jpg wallpapers for your own phone and leave app development to those with skills &amp; style. poser
B005C0DHEY|2.0|This documentary should have been no longer than 45 minutes. While the director was a very interesting person, the documentary just seemed to go on and on. This movie relies heavily on lighting tap water aflame, rather than interviews with scientists. While illuminating, this documentary seems to lean heavily toward Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt rather than scientific analysis. That said, there are some scary scenes in this film - but nothing that would surprise anyone with a basic 1-minute description of how the hydraulic fracturing process works.<br /><br />I was very surprised and disappointed that this film did not cover the relationship of hydraulic fracturing to earthquakes.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I loved that this game has so many puzzles to work on. Great graphics and so far I have found it easy, just find everything in the scenes.
0439023521|5.0|I just finished reading Collins' The Hunger Games for the second time in a few months, finding that I loved it even more the second time.  The first time, I was so fraught with worry for the characters that I couldn't fully appreciate the complexity of the character development and the details of the plotting.<br /><br />When a friend first described this book to me by saying \\"it's about a future world where the government forces 24 teenagers to travel to a huge arena and fight to the death,\\" I didn't even try to hide my eye rolling.  \\"That sounds terrible,\\" I groaned.  She finally convinced me to try it: \\"Just read a chapter or two and see what you think,\\" she urged.  Well, she couldn't have been more right . . . I only had to read a few pages of this book to get fully engrossed and hooked.<br /><br />Yes, the premise is brutal and repellant.<br /><br />Yes, the book contains a lot of graphic violence.<br /><br />Yes, you will be disgusted by the insensitivity and selfishness of the government in this dystopian society.<br /><br />And, yes, you won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Just read a chapter or two and see if I'm wrong!<br /><br />You can thank me later . . . and now if you'll excuse me, I have a friend that I need to thank.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|if you live in la this is perfect for you but if you live in Minnesota like me it wont.... it doesn't recognize the city I live in or Minneapolis which is dumb because its a big city in Minnesota ...

B0064NTZJO|5.0|I was shocked at the high number of 1-star reviews.  There are already thorough, on-point positive reviews, so I won't bother trying to cover any of the same points but I will try to set the right expectations for those who haven't seen it yet.  It's not a \\"fast and furious\\" clone, despite what the haters seem to have been expecting.  Don't watch any previews, don't assume anything, and you might just be as pleasantly surprised as I was to find that people who are passionate about movies are still taking risks and pushing the envelope for what movies could and should be.<br /><br />Side note: Ultraviolet has got the be the most disappointing digital format.  Why can't I just have an actual digital copy to keep on my devices?  I don't want to stream it!  How is one supposed to watch a movie on a plane this way?  Slow, unreliable, expensive, and scarcely available in-flight wi-fi is the only way.  Or if you're out of the country, forget about streaming it to your phone--international data rates are prohibitively expensive.  I have a love-hate relationship with Sony, and these days, with anti-consumer junk like this, the hate is far more powerful.  They completely missed the boat regarding many usage scenarios where a digital copy would be appealing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is very very very very fun. Its sometimes easy and sometimes hard. I love the variety of games. Don't get the update or you lose all your progress.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is so cool. I like the challenge of collecting the points. you can spend hours on this and not even know it. its that fun. I likeit a lot.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|here I am just in this app that says it's gonna make weather good (that's what the plus means). I downloaded it and as soon I downloaded it starts pouring down cats and dogs. please fix!!!
B000V39KDO|2.0|I realize this was fantasy, however, it was not necessary to make it rediculous.  People don't run around nude in the snow.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|As the title says this is my favorite potter movie. They pulled the whole thing together really well. Nothing but action. Just like part one, this movie is completely different than all the others. the blu ray looks amazing. I dont care anything about digital copies so I wont comment on that.
B005HSL626|3.0|its a cool game but it froze 2 Times in 1 minute and I had to shut my kindle down
B006MQRLSA|4.0|Great movie wish the ending was one of what we expect after obstacles are over come.  Over all  its a great story and one that can  be kept in your collection.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Given that I have an M.A. in both Theology and the Philosophy of Religion and Ethics, I love the Matrix films mostly because of the religious and philosophical issues raised concerning ontology, epistemology, and ethics. I am also a martial arts fan; indeed, I have to confess that, as a teenager, I spent a number of Saturday nights watching Black Belt Theater. This box set is a must have for any Matrix fan.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is sooo fun, it is great to pass the time, let a younger child play, or even an adult! Absolutely get this app!
B005721W9O|5.0|This is one of my favorite flicks. Great re-watch value. Finally watched it last week with our 4-year-old, 6-year-old, and 8-year-old, and they loved it. Aside from a couple \\"scary\\" parts it was mostly kid compatible. My kids still laugh about the part where \\"the animal is inside out... and it exploded\\".
B003YL4LYI|4.0|While I really enjoyed this novel, it's still significantly weaker than Martin's initial three. That said, ideally this series is culminating in some ridiculously awesome final two novels, and I think this book does a good job leading into that. Still, some of my favorite characters are at their worst in this book (Daenerys, Tyrion). Luckily, Jon Snow is at his best, and in spite of its problems, it's a great read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The many versions and search capabilities work very well and are quick. Particularly like the many devotionals and ease of use by going rift to the verse referenced. Once I loaded versions to my kindle I did not need to be connected to cloud. With some Bible versions with audio read it was the icing on the cake.
1450400957|5.0|The body renderings of the muscles are absolutely incredible.  It's one thing to have knowledge about weight training, but this book takes it to a new level.  It will show you exactly what you want to do, and--equally important--will show you how to avoid injuries during your workout.  There is a whole series of books (Stretching, Core, etc.) and they are all fabulous.  Frankly, I don't know how they can sell these beautifully illustrated books at such a reasonable price (about $14 per book), but I recommend that you get one (or more) and see for yourself.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|really fun a little slow at first but it picks up and get really fun thecustimization is great and money is easy to make
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|very nice app.  keep up the great work.  disagree with the negative comments herein.  the app is beautiful.  2 thumbs up for me.
031617615X|3.0|In which Stephenie Meyer ends the Twilight series in the most bizarre and confounding way possible. I'm not just talking about the plotting, although trying to list the number of truly weird plot points in this book would make for entertaining reading; suffice to say, Meyer goes for broke in this one, adding volumes onto her supernatural mythology and leaving the reader often a little confused as to just how far she's going to push this. (When a grown man falling in love with a baby isn't the strangest thing in your book, I think that says quite a bit.) No, what I'm more talking about is Meyer's unbelievably disastrous pacing, as well as her belief that what you need as you're bringing a multi-book series to an end is a massive influx of storylines, new characters, plot threads, and deus ex machinae that come out of nowhere to save the day. If there's one thing the Twilight books have had in common, it's been fairly leisurely pacing and plotting, with Meyer choosing to focus more on the Bella-Edward romance than anything else. But Breaking Dawn defies that, rocketing from plot point to plot point so quickly and without reason that the reader spends half the book wondering if she's actually planning on wrapping anything up. And by the time the book seems like it's about to end, Meyer starts a whole new storyline and starts expanding her world just in time to end it. It's an incredibly odd decision, and one that doesn't sit well with me; if you're ending a book, that's not the time to start world-building. All of that being said, Breaking Dawn certainly entertains, even if it's just from awe at just how gonzo everything is getting. And to give credit where it's due, the middle third of Breaking Dawn finds Meyer switching narrators, allowing Jacob Black to take over, and it turns out that Meyer can write a character with personality, engaging narration, and even character depth; it's just that she's never shown it for the rest of the series, and Bella's narration in the final third of the book doesn't show any of that either. Breaking Dawn is probably the most entertaining of the Twilight books, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it makes the book \\"good\\"; Meyer's writing and pacing are still all over the map, the characters still bewildering, and the plotting out of control. Still, there's imagination and excitement throughout, and that goes a long way, I'd say.e final third of the book doesn't show any of that either.

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I am so frustrated with this app!!  It comes with no instruction manual at all and I can't figure out how to simply change numbers in an Excel file that I made for grocery shopping.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|What a waste of space!! Any app that uses 46 megs ought to be really special, and this isn't at all special. There are many free apps that are much smaller and more functional. Try Weather Channel's app instead.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|At 46MB, this is a huge investment in space. It lacks a widget and seems to poll data from an inaccurate source.<br /><br />The size alone for a weather app is a deal-breaker for me.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|cool game, challenging yet tricky. check it out. it is cool and u will enjoy playing it as much as I do.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is very helpfull to me when I'm studding .<br />IT ALSO MAKE IT EASY TO LISTEN TO WHEN LOOKING FOR INFORMATION .AND EASY TO READ ALSO. THIS HAS BEEN THE EASYEST FOR ME.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|I had a vhs but I had to get a dvd of The Bodyguard.  It is a good movie and with Whitney's passing I had to add it to my collection.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|This game is ok to a good time waster but you have to keep buying games to get to the 101 games.  Also the quality is not that great.  It is free though
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Bought this flash primarily when using my wide-angle lenses so I won't get the dark crescent spot at the bottom of my pictures.  Works for what I need it.  The flash capacity is very similar to the built-in camera flash (I've used it on a Nikon D90 and D5100.) It's also small and convenient to carry.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|after lot of bad reviews I was hesitant to get this free app of the day. But I actually like it as a lot of international cities that I travel to and it has accurate information for the cities.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game you can get all those games in one is just pure awlsomeness sweet and you should get this game for wii.
0316066524|5.0|There are a lot of ignorant reviewers both praising and bashing it. And I'll say this: You can not read and understand this in a week. The slower you read it, the better. And you'll probably end up reading it twice! This book is the work of a genius and is really nothing like Pynchon. His prose is different; his goals were different, and his story's mystery and complexity has to be discovered. And on that note: If you felt that this book was banal, bloated, and lacked interesting content, he succeeded in manipulating you into believing what you were reading was normal. And yes, this was one of his goals. Simply put, he's a literary magician. This story has so much misdirection in it, that you'll wind up feeling humbled when you finally get a glimpse of what's actually going on.
0756407125|5.0|What this book does extraordinarily well is manage to keep the stakes engaging and suspenseful from cover to cover, without slamming you over the head with the overarching conflict from the outset.  You know the outcome is world changing, but the narrative of a boy becoming a man is not concerned with his obvious destiny so much as his simple struggle to survive and find a place in the world.<br /><br />I have rarely read a book so simple in scope, and so grand in execution.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|ok...<br />so all these reveiws say 'this is a great book' and 'must read' but why should you read this book and spend your money? Thats why this reveiw is like none other! If you have read the percy jackson books and\or any other Rick Riorden books then you will probably be keen to buy this but if you havn't already, i reconmend reading 'Heros of Olympus the lost hero' first otherwise you won't have a clue whats going on. There is lots of charectors to try and remember which might be a good thing as it was interesting hearing about them and there bavkround. This also sparked new love! lots of action and new enimies and heros! One of this things i like about these books is I actually learn about greek gods! so i'm now into all the 'so called' mythical stuff! In this book every chaptor is from a different charectors point of veiw. Percy is at the Roman camp and he has lost his memory, although he does remember one faint thing... Anabeth. Rick Riorden probably made Percy remember Annabeth so he wouldn't fall in love with someone else and spark a commotion 'nice thinking Riorden' im not going to give anymore of the story away cuase this would give it away but i have high expectations for Mark of Athena the next book in the series as this book was top notch and thrilling left me hanging. IF your still not sure about thi book then buy a sample! thanks for listening or reading for that matter my reveiw!
0312430000|4.0|A surgeon uses the narrative of his research and personal experience to give a good rundown of the value of the humble checklist in this age of information overload. It also elaborates on the right ways to use checklists and when they aren't appropriate. One ends up with the impression that checklists could be applied in almost any field however, giving this short book wide appeal. Perhaps the one drawback: in demonstrating the value of checklists toward the medical profession, he ends up drawing light on the prevalence of mistakes made in the field. It's hardly a muckraking expose to say that a small but preventable percentage of doctors skip standard procedures like hand washing occasionally, but I suspect the naturally paranoid will have their nerves triggered the next time they need an operation.<br /><br />A special mention needs to be made of Gawande's comment that we value the individual hero's ability to adapt, not without justification. But such reverence for 'horse by the reigns' culture can actually increase danger in the broad picture. The establishment and practice of otherwise mundane rules and standard procedures, when done correctly, saves lives. Recommended.

B002ZG97LK|2.0|I want to be clear the only reason this film is getting 2 stars is because I like the remake of some of the songs and willard danced better in this remake.<br /><br />I have never bothered to review a film before, but I felt after watching this film it was my duty to warn people.  the bad acting random lines from old movie, the dance off at a drive in movie theater were all the girls danced like they were swinging on poles ohh wait they did swing on poles.  This movie could have been so much better, the 15 people that gave it 5 stars must have been all men and had the film on mute.<br /><br />old movie 5 stars, new movie money better spent on mcdonalds cheese burger, both have fillers, but the burger at least tastes good!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Like everyone said it is not the beast amd claims it to be, but it runs a lot cooler than the 1055T and does not tax my power supply at all. The 1055T is overpriced and if it performs better it is only do to its power consumption. The 1055T nearly cooked my power supply, the fx-6100 goes easy on it. And they both perform about the same for what i was doing, games, winrar, internet.....the trick is to find a good video card as the video card and hard drive are what bottleneck my pc right now. thats right i used the same vid card and harddrive for both procoessors and saw that they did the same performance, but the 1055T seemed to give higher read outs for other components on the build. the 1055T works better with other components and that is really the only reasion why it is better and thats if it is at all ..... like i said the 1055T seems to perform slightly better but your power supply unit may not be safe from it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good and does what it says. Wish spider was included but nice time killer for price. Just filling up space now.

B007M6P01O|5.0|Seriously this episode was amazing.<br /><br />I haven't read the comics yet, but who ever that was that made an appearance at the end looks completely incredible. There's so many questions that I want to ask about her!<br /><br />It's episodes like this one that make getting through the slower ones worth it. This one and the mid-season finale were awesome.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This app is brilliant! I found out that this app shows up fine on my fire!<br />However, I made this review to counter the expected 1 star rating by Superman and his followers.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|OK, first off, there is no homescreen widget, secondly, its a huge app, and thirdly, not to many options available. dev needs to overhaul this app, do not buy until he does, uninstall.

0143119680|4.0|Diana Bishop is a hereditary witch, descended from a witch who was burned during the Salem Witch Trials. However, after Diana's parents were killed in Africa when she was seven, she has turned her back on her talents and devoted her life to academia, particularly historical science and its cousin, alchemy.<br /><br />When she calls up an old manuscript she recognizes as magic, she draws the attention of all the magical creatures in the vicinity: other witches and their natural enemies vampires and daemons. One vampire in particular, a fellow professor at Oxford, takes an interest in both Diana and the manuscript, and they throw in their lot together to solve the mystery. If their partnership takes a turn toward romance, all the better.<br /><br />I've often said my \\"shame reads\\" are classified on GoodReads on my \\"vampires\\" shelf, and A Discovery of Witches hits all the markers: vampires, witches, paranormal events, romance, and above all, book porn. One of the things I love about vampire books is how much of history creatures that old have seen, and when you add in things like first editions of Darwin's Origin of Species with annotations, I geek out to a pathetic level. This book has it all in spades, and I read it every spare second I had, and if the other two books in the trilogy were out already, I'm sure I would have read all three back to back.<br /><br />Even one glaring factual error wasn't enough to dissuade me from continuing to the end at breakneck speed. I'm an addict, and can't wait for my next hit.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app! It is very useful and easy to use. I like the fact that you can check Evermore across different platforms - phone, tablet,  computer.

B003WE9WRI|5.0|Max Brooks's 'The Zombie Survival Guide' is written as a non-fiction book, even though the topic of Zombies is a fictional/fantasy topic. Not if, but WHEN the apocalypse comes, I'll be the best equiped, having read this book 11 times in the past year. It is my bible, and the intricate detail of this book is absoloutely astonishing. This book single handedly made the most awesome writer in the world, Max Brooks, my favourite author almost four years ago, and I've purchased all of his books and never looked back since!
0439023521|5.0|This book...... Wow. I'm 12 and i love it. I have read the whole series 3 times and i can recite the first chapter. I love the mix of humor, action, suspende, romance, and violence. Dont listen to the dums azzez that say the books are horrible... Yes you need to be a certain age, i suggest 11-16 but Everyone i know that has read it loved it. I cant WAIT to see the movie. I think Katniss sets a good example for children, she takes matters into her own hands, helps others, thinks fast, and lightens the mood. For the 3rd movie im auditioning for Prim, because shes my favorite. But anyway, its a great great great book.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce Springsteen  \\"Wrecking Ball\\"  #1  (2012).<br /><br />Bruce's 17th album, \\"Wrecking Ball\\", just continues Springsteen's enveloping music career.  I see about 25% of the people here can't stand this disc, they want more \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"Darkness\\", i'm sorry, but Bruce has grown out of that, he was 25 when he did \\"Born\\" and 27 when he did \\"Darkness\\".  At 62 Bruce has grown both musically and spiritually.  I think most people have written everything about the tunes on this great album, so i'll just say, these were the songs that hit home for me.  \\"We Take Care Of Are Own\\", great lead single, this song  should of been kicking out all over classic rock radio, but that format is growing stale way to fast.  The Tom Morello guitar solo's on \\"Jack Of All Trades\\" and \\"This Depression\\", help these tunes.  I think that Bruce has been listening to the Dropkick Murphy's or something on \\"Death To My Hometown\\". good stuff.  \\"Shackled And Drawn\\", a song that should get radio play, it's that good!  The title track, a song we saw him play on his last tour, still has charm in the studio setting, nice trumpet by (native Kansan) Curt Ramm and violin by Suzi Tyrell.  \\"You've Got It\\", a nice paced song with a good guitar break.  \\"Rocky Ground\\", talk about a song that is getting blasted, but to my ears this is a great spiritual tune, nice vocals by Michelle Moore.  (I'm sensing there are lot of people that don't belief on this site), just a great tune and I don't really care for rap either. (Grow with Bruce people).  \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\", a song he has done also on recent tours, is another lift up your spirit songs, again with back-up vocals by Michelle Moore and sax by Clarence.  \\"We Are Alive\\", A nice Irish stomper with excellent horns, (has a Cash feel), you can rise from the dead!  \\"Swallowed Up (In The Belly Of The Whale)\\", great tune, very emotional song, read the words.  \\"American Land\\", another song that he has been performing on tour for the last 6 or 7 years, this version is a little different than the live version, still a great song!  You just gotta dance to this.  Overall a tremendous album.  (Oh hell, I rambled on).<br /><br />Nice moving comments by Bruce on the Big Man in the liners.<br /><br />Also listen to NPR, and listen to Springsteen's keynote speech at the SWSW music festival, great  50 minute talk.<br /><br />Also Eric Church has made a nice tribute to Bruce, on his recent album \\"Chief\\".
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Love the look and the options. For people having trouble setting widgets to home screens make sure the app is not installed on sd card. Not  battery hog either.
B0026MOVO6|5.0|This album is a masterpiece, definitely the best one in Whitney's catalog. It kicks off with the mega hit It's Not Right But It's Okay where we listen to a new amazing vocal style and a very modern R&B with smart lyrics and awesome production 5/5. Heartbreak Hotel is such a gem! The voices of the three ladies mix perfectly and the song is truly out of this world 5/5. I feel like I can't even go on because then the title track kicks in and it's a different kind of amazing; I only say that because the producer is Wyclef Jean but we can still feel the soul in each and every word that Whitney is singing 5/5. When You Believe, the duet with Mariah Carey is magical the first times you hear it, but I have listened to it so much that it's kind of washed out for me, I still think it's awesome 4.5/5. In If I Told You That we get Darkchild again doing an amazing production job and making Whitney deliver very great ad-libs over the whole song 5/5. In My Business with Missy Elliott is a little bit weaker and not so solid as one would expect, still 4/5. I Learned From The Best is so incredibly powerful, wow 5/5. Then Oh Yes gives us Houston in the most sexy moment of her career, it's sublime 5/5. Get It Back is 4/5, Until You Come Back 5/5, I Bow Out 5/5, You'll Never Stand Alone 5/5 and the hidden track I Was Made To Love Him, a faboulous Stevie Wonder cover 4/5
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I received this DVD set very fast. It took 2 days. I couldn't wait to see my fiancé face when I gave it to him. He really loved it!! It's a good item to own if your into war. I was very pleased.
1405509147|5.0|I don't know about other reviewers but I found this book really hard to get started. Its grim tone hits you hard in the face and it's no surprise that Steinbeck said of the book that \\"I've done my damndest to rip a reader's nerves to rags\\". But once you can adapt to the bleak tone of the book (and the narrator) it becomes deeply compelling, to the point where you will want your car journey to work to last just that little bit longer so you can listen to that little bit more.<br /><br />Anyhow, to let you know what the audio version of the book is like, it is first rate. Many audio books pick readers who have little to no versatility in conveying their charactors and read the book as if reading the football results. John Chancer is different as he really conveys well the 12 charactors of the family, so much so that you could swear that you've actually met the family and heard their voices!<br /><br />One limitation of the package is that it is a box with 16 CD's in 16 in fiddly thin sleeves. The CD case has a tendency to fall on the floor and chuck its contents all over the car, which is highly annoying when you are endeavouring to concentrate.<br /><br />But, aside from that, the story is excellent and the narrator creates a rich cast of voices to fit the landscape of the book.<br /><br />Incidentally, anyone who's a fan of the comedian Bill Hicks may be interested to know that this book was said to be his favourite. Hicks loved the book so much that he even based his 'famous last words' on Tom Joad's final speech \\"I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.\\"<br /><br />Although Tom Joad's final speech is actually different, the spirit is the same and it's easy to see why he picked that part as it is easily the most profound part of a deeply moving novel.

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|This Movie had the potential of being a Good Jane Erye Movie the one thing that I didnt like about it the most important scenes were left out which is what tells the love developing between Rochester and Jane when it is like that  the story isnt told it dont make a lot of since. If you want to see the best Get the dalton and clark  Stephens and wilson cant be beat!
0439023521|5.0|This book sorta reminds me of Stephen King's THE LONG WALK.  Love them both, can't wait to see the movie!
B0007R4TAS|3.0|After viewing I like this movie however it is not a true Jane Erye by the book It is a sweet love story!
B00417HV14|3.0|I read all the reviews on this and decided to take the Blu-Ray plunge, regardless.  Musically this is a great concert, if you are a JB fan, which of course I am - nothing more annoying than someone who goes out of their way to trash a DVD/Blu-Ray of a band in concert that they do not like.  It happens - go figure!<br />Anyway, back to the plot, from a video and audio perspective, this is a disappointing production.  Only some of the camera angles (particularly the distant shots) appear to be HD.  A lot of the close-up, front of stage work is kind of washed out and softened and has a strange blue/purple hue about it.  Having seen other bands filmed in HD (check out Certifiable - The Police, Kings of Leon, Live at The O2 Centre and The Foo Fighters, Live at Wembley Stadium) their productions, both visually and audibly are vastly superior.  The JB Blu-Ray is like watching a scaled up DVD.  This is my only reason for the 3 stars as musically it is a superb concert for JB and blues fans in general.  It is also very refreshing to hear, or should I say, not hear, the infuriating whoops and screams during the quieter moments, that younger/American audiences seem to feel obliged to fill the silence with rather than have a quiet, emotional passage in the music that requires them to actually listen and engage with the performer.<br />In summary, great performance, very disappointing quality Blu-Ray.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I am annoyingly enthusiastic about this film. I have never been so captivated and so engrossed in a film since I was a child. Others may tell you it's overrated, but behind all the hype, this movie truly delivers. All I could think upon my first viewing was, \\"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen.\\" I've thought about it over and over, and I cannot for the life of me think of one negative thing to say about this film. Christopher Nolan is a GENIUS.
B007M6P01O|2.0|(do I need to indicate if there are spoilers or is it just understood, oh well) This whole show for the most part seemed to depict a somewhat sense of \\"realism\\" to me with many aspects. There weren't any instances of magic guns with unlimited ammo, there weren't really illogical twists, there was emotion with the death of friends and loved ones, and there was a feeling of doing whatever it takes to survive. This episode wipes away all of that. How can anyone be truly satisfied with that episode? The last two episodes of the season was like taking 80 steps backwards, after the previous episodes starting mid-season began to revive this show a bit. Herschel only had to reload his shotgun once? And just when a walker happened to be sneaking up behind him? Come on director et al, we expect better than Hollywood movie stunts. This show is supposed to be one with substance. Darryl is able to magically find everyone cruising along despite all cars going to the four corners of the world? Rick runs out of gas despite the fact that the last I recall, Shane's car had like 4 gas cans in the back before the attack, AND they had just left a highway of cars? Siphon baby, siphon! No one is really phased by the deaths among Herschel's family, except the one daughter? Andrea is dead to them- shrug it off. Is there no one of any moral fiber in the group anymore other than Darryl, Herschel's family, and Glenn? Please kill Lori. This show has 2 or 3 episodes next season to convince me to stick around.
0790731940|5.0|Well, I haven't heard of \\"Maverick\\" in a couple decades, but there it was sitting on the DVD bargain rack at my nearby Ross Store. I had to have it, of course. It has a caste with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner in the starring roles. I didn't see it in the theaters, but I saw a few episodes of the old TV series shows long ago.<br /><br />\\"Maverick\\" is a western. Sorta. It's the story of a gambler working his way to a major poker event and trying to gather up funding along the way. None of his friends can be trusted with anything. Trust me.  It's a fine low-key comedy in a droll twisted sort of way. The entire movie is not only a primitive-travel adventure, but a journey that has a lot of comedic twists and turns. I found myself laughing all the way, but it's not that brash laugh-out-loud sort of thing. Most of the laughter is deeply internal, at least for me. What can I say? It's just a funny movie and very enjoyable to watch. The acting is good. The photography and scenery are excellent. The musical score is very good and is capped by an ending song by Randy Newman. It's just a fun movie!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I have seen this movie before and gave away my VCR copy so was excited to get a DVD of it...thanks
B005FITIK0|2.0|Too bad that the cast was wasted in this film.  The premise is silly:  a woman whose book series is faltering wants to go back to her hometown and try to take an old flame away from his wife and baby. Right.  Yeah.  She is so unsympathetic that it is hard to feel for her even when she finally comes to her senses, more or less.<br />Looks like Cody was being lazy this time around.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|has some good games and a good variety. fun to pass the time away. hope they add new games soon.
B007M6P01O|5.0|The season finale of \\"The Walking Dead\\" was fantastic and really beautifully photographed and choreographed at times. It was very reminiscent of the type of episodes we got to see in season 1. In fact, this was the best episode since the pilot.<br /><br />I couldn't care for most of the second season and its soap opera/love triangle/who is the father of my baby/the jilted ex lover going psycho/Days of Our zombie Lives stagy drama about basically two Alphas being engaged in a \\"who has the bigger man? hood\\" debate. Or that dumb kid Carl roaming around the farm during the zombie apocalypse unsupervised for no other reason than to move the plot along when convenient; or the trite, oftentimes idiotic and hollow dialogues apparently written by a bunch of college freshmen who still haven't taken a \\"Writing 140 for Freshman\\" class yet or read any literature or philosophy books other than comics it seems; or how the entire season was about those three above mentioned people and their petty problems while the other characters were grossly neglected and in fact were slowly moved to the background becoming mere props and scene fillers while Rick and Shane worked out the question of who exactly has ownership of Lori and Carl. I didn't care for any of that and most fans of the show didn't either. Season two was mostly slow and uneventful with boring episodes interspersed sparsely with real thought and engagement.<br /><br />But the finale almost made up for all those comatose episodes. This episode was intense, dark, scary, heart-breaking and terrifying - all at once. I was nailed to my chair the whole time, which I can't say of any of the other episodes in this season really.<br /><br />A few thoughts:<br /><br />- Lori has got to go. She is selfish, unreasonable and ungrateful. An overall unlikable character and actress. Totally miscast. She is a terrible mother, disloyal wife, lousy friend and she's always treating Rick like crap. Even in the pilot, when Rick talks about her and what she said to him in front of their son and when she herself, in flashbacks, talks about her marriage and what she said to Rick, it is evident that she treated him like crap all the time. She slept with Shane a couple of days after her husband was believed dead but without taking any responsibility for it afterwards and then hid behind Rick to fix it. A few episodes ago she pillow talked Rick into getting rid of Shane or doing something about him, Now that he did fix it - and that only to save his own life since Shane wanted to murder him - she is all upset and disgusted and looks at him like he was the worst human being. Urgh. This woman. I cant wait for her to turn into the zombie she really is at heart.<br /><br />- Carol is meek and annoying. I am tired of her victim, doormat mentality. She always complains, whines  and blames others for not doing stuff for her: whining to Rick, whining to Daryl. She never does anything but clean and cook and whine. Daryl was right \\"What do you want?\\" What does she want? She is stabbing Rick in the back for no apparent reason and questioning his dedication and leadership. Why? Rick only treated her with utmost kindness and respect, he never raised his voice on her. And it wasnt his fault Sophia got out from under the car and ran into the woods and then again moved even though he told her to stay put.<br /><br />And yeah so he lied about the virus thing. That doesnt make him someone \\"who is capable of anything.\\" I thought Carol's character was interesting at first but I don't see it going anywhere except for her just instigating hate and making people turn on each other. She strikes me as one of those people from the Salem Witch Trials who just screams \\"witch\\" and everyone listens to her because she is quiet and calm otherwise. I also dont get what the deal is with Daryl and her. What does Daryl see in her? And what does she want out of him? Love, romance, protection? What? I must say I don't see romance between the two.<br/><br />- I like Maggie. I didn't at first but she is cool and she finally grew up and she has integrity too.<br /><br />- I dont like that they are trying to make Rick sound mean or as some sort of a second Shane. They all looked at him like he was Ted Bundy when all he did was defend himself. I mean, the guy was being led to the woods to be murdered by his best friend who was after his wife and son. And people look at HIM like it was his fault. Rick gave everything for the group; he has character, integrity and loyalty - which is more than can be said of a lot of people here yet the first respite they get, they blame him.<br /><br /> - Andrea is a trooper. I love her. She is the only woman who doesn't act like a stereotype and like she couldn't take a step without a man telling her or ordering her to - like Lori and Carol and those farm girls (except for Maggie). Lori is an idiot who defines herself based on the men she sleeps with it. Carol is meek, but Andrea, she risked her life to rescue Carol and she made her way out of that terrifying chaos surrounded by Walkers; on foot no less. She kept running and running and the whole time I kept thinking \\"how does she do that, she is amazing.\\" She is a fighter to the last minute and she has character and is loyal. So it strikes me as bizarre that everyone is always interested in Lori and Carol and that throughout the whole decision making process she is never an integral part. They are totally underutilizing Andrea.<br /><br />She has great leadership capacity and is overall just a great character. They would be dead if it wasnt for her. If Rick takes his head out of Lori's ungrateful a-$$ for once and stops being hung up on making her happy, he will see that and actually work with Andrea as opposed to ordering her around. I think they are all taking her for granted but they know that if push comes to shove, their next best \\"man\\" is Andrea. Remember Rick entrusted her with keeping an eye on Shane. He knew he could count on her and if you noticed, he doesn't talk to her the way he talks to the other woman. He talks to her like she is one of the guys and knows whaz happening. She should go out there with Daryl too taking down Walkers - they'd make a great team.<br /><br />- Glenn is cool. I have always liked his character. He was made to be meek and weak halfway through season 2 but when it comes down to it, he is totally capable and just overall a great guy.<br /><br />- Hershel is cool too. I forgive him his references to christ and the bible. He is an old man set in his ways and he views the world from that angle. Although I think he actually has come to terms with the fact that all that christ stuff is nonsense at this juncture.<br /><br />I  sincerely hope the writers don't venture out into soap territory come season 3 and are able to keep a deft balance between character development and just the slow parts that then built up to something like we have seen in this episode. In fact, this episode is great because they have moved away from that petty party that was the farm and the love triangle. I understand that not all episodes can be about running away, but the focus of the show must shift from soap opera dram into survival and the walkers as another character, as opposed to the incidental backdrop for these characters to work out their petty quarrels. In other words, strike a nice balance.<br /><br />I also hope they actually use Daryl, Andrea and the other characters more during the next season, develop them and their friendships and roles in the group. It is a shame a lot of them were neglected so badly that the actors playing them felt the need to quit. There is a great canvas to work with here and I hope the writers will see that.<br /><br />So overall, cool episode. The best since the pilot. Really liked it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Where to begin....I heard about this novel on the Today Show, last week and decided to check it out and I am so thankful I did.  This book was AMAZING!  Erotic, Romantic, Psychological, Thrilling, and Addictive, just a few adjectives that describe this incredible book. It evokes so many different emotions as you turn the page, very rapidly, I might add.  This is a very fast read and one I couldn't put down to save my soul.  I stayed up late, woke up early and read every single second that I had available till book one of this trilogy had come to an end.  I cannot wait for some of my friends to read this delicious novel so we can discuss it.  On to Book Two - Fifty Shades Darker!
0307352145|5.0|I wish I had this book years ago. Every manager, teacher, HR staff member, you name it, should read this book. It's such a relief to know I'm not alone with wanting to be alone and needing that solitude to recharge. The modern world is just plain overstimulating for some people. Thank you, Susan, for validating what I suspected for quite some time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After finishing book one - Fifty Shades of Grey, I immediately began to read book two, Fifty Shades Darker.  This is such an amazing trilogy, that I cannot get anything done.  Not that I know, but I would compare it to a crack addiction.  No matter what I'm doing all I can think about is this story.  You MUST read Fifty Shades of Grey prior to reading this novel.  On to book three, and turning the page of  - Fifty Shades Freed.<br /><br />These are a few of my favorite things....a grand piano, an Audi, an elevator, a pool table and oh yes, those gray flannel pants.  :)

0545123267|5.0|Maggie Stiefvatar has taken a fairly simplistic plot and turned it into a beautiful and captivating story that I could not put down. The romance between Sam and Grace is at the forefront of this story, with only a few elements thrown in. But this is no problem for me. The relationship is so captivating, so sweet so perfect that I was hooked from page one.<br /><br />My heat broke for them, knowing that this was Sam's \\"last year\\" (which I hope desperately future books talk about why he was getting so few years comparatively) and that his romance with Grace would've short lived.<br /><br />The kissy/sexy times in Shiver were amazing! Stiefvatar writes so beautifully, so perfectly that it was just melt your heart amazing. Despite the insta-love feeling, it makes sense with these two, and it works.<br /><br />In the end, Shiver was a fascinating twist on one of my favorite supernatural creatures! The story was well paced and the paranormal creatures that Maggie Stiefvatar has created are believable. Sam and Grace are lovable and well developed characters.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sweet love story with a splash of paranormal than this is definitely the book for you!

I read it and I'm already reading the second book destiny of souls.  This book has made me see life in a different way.  It has explained many of the doubts I had about life, and has helped me take life easier and not be so tough on myself and others.  It has helped me understand why others are the way they are and is helping me to not judge others as I used to do before.  This book has sooo much great information that it will clear any doubts you may have about reincarnation and life after death.  I really recommend this wonderful book!!!

B007CGLRWA|5.0|DETACHMENT is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking. Written by first time writer Carl Lund and directed by the controversial Tony Kaye (one would never know, but he performs music and comedy at open mics around Los Angeles), and presented by one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable, this film should be required viewing for everyone from junior high to the elderly.  In one poignant story we are provided glimpses into the current status of our public education, the plight of burned out teachers attempting to repair the absent parent syndrome while reaching out to find a place beyond drugs, fighting, physical and mental abuse and the lethargy of responding to a chaotic world, and a dark view of the existentialism that allows each of us to forge ahead despite a sense of worth in a world gone crazy.<br /><br />Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody in a galvanizing performance) copes with life as a substitute teacher: he comes into schools for a specific stint then detaches and repeats the cycle of caring to provide hope for kids to become someone of significance, failing repeatedly.  He is assigned to a New York school headed by the soon to be fired Principal Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), meets a classroom of foul mouthed, disrespectful, angry students and attempts to teach them English. He is immediately challenged by a sassy kid whom he sends out of the room, a young angry black student with whom he connects by showing him parameters of interaction, a young obese, disturbed but gentle Meredith (Betty Kay, in a sterling performance) among others.  He also encounters the other teachers and staff - the beautiful Sarah Madison (Christina Hendricks), the school counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu), the burned out Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) and Ms Perkins (Blythe Danner) and Mr. Sarge Kepler (William Peterson), and only teacher who fights back with a sense of humor Mr. Charles Seaboldt (James Caan).  It is a grim situation and Henry takes his depression home.<br /><br />Henry encounters a young girl Erica (Sami Gayle, in a career making role) who despite her youth is a street hooker, beaten badly by her johns. He offers her protection in his meager home - a place to sleep and eat and recover form the street abuse of her profession.  A profound relationship develops - and while that satisfies Erica's desperate need for family, it frightens Henry enough to eventually call foster care to remove her.  Henry visits his elderly mentally challenged Grandpa (Louis Zorich) who lives in a assisted living home and his frustrations about his memories of his apparently alcoholic suicidal mother and the lack of care being given his Grandpa results in one of Henry's rare explosions of anger - a rage that extends to every aspect of his view of life. At school Henry gradually wins the hearts and minds of his class, showing them that education is the path to living a life of meaning.  His friendship with the beleaguered Meredith is supportive, but as Henry completes his three week assignment at the school tragedies surround him.  It seems that everyone in the story is in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.<br /><br />In addition to the actors mentioned there are shining little vignette roles by Celia Au, Ren&eacute;e Felice Smith, Kwoade Cross, and others - many appearing for the first time on film and each radiating talent.  But the film belongs to Adrien Brody who provides such a staggeringly real character that his message is felt in every cell of the viewer's mind.  This is a first rate film in every aspect. It should be seen by everyone who either shares the mental milieu of the characters depicted here or cares deeply about the sad chaotic situation we have created during these particular times.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|Many of the BIG shows get celebrations such as this 25th anniversary production of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and they are well deserved. The similar production of LES MISERABLES remains a popular item among lovers of musical theater. Recording such as this include the excitement and enchantment of audience reaction and that is a true showing of love. The production at Royal Albert Hall (huge though it is) is splendid - semi-staging, lighting, orchestral performance and singing. It just works very very well.<br /><br />One of the main reasons to purchase this DVD is to actually get to watch Ramin Karimloo weave his spell. Not only is his voice perfect for this role (and for the many other roles he is successfully adding to his repertoire) but his stage presence is completely within the concept of the original work. He has the audience spellbound with his acting, his physique, and his glorious singing. Much the same can be said for Sierra Boggess. She adds tremendously to the blending of voices that is so much a part of whether or not this wild tale works.<br /><br />Not only is this a fine tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber but it is also a tribute to the tenacity of fine musical theater. For all lovers of Webber's output this recording is a must. Grady Harp, March 12

B002GHIPYI|4.0|These are great budget cans. They are clear and crisp with nice midrange and decent bass response. I can only find two things worth complaining about with these: First, the treble is harsh. Very harsh. But manageable. Secondly, the bass is a little lacking for my taste. The midbass is good, but the deeper regions are pretty flat. All in all, great for the price.

But truthfully, Ana and Christian's antics reminded me how we've let things slip a bit.  Hearts and flowers.  Expecting romance.  Being patient and kind even when your other is being a little crazy.  Being honest about how you feel in a warm, heartfelt way - even if it isn't good news.  Doing little things for your mate - because you can.  Letting your inner goddess out (woo hoo)!<br /><br />Sure surprised the heck out of my husband!  But he's been going to work lately with a secret smile on his face...  :)

An animated background is nice but I'd happily trade that for a better use of the tablet real estate if that's what it took to have more features. No map/radar, no alerts, just three widgets that can't be customized, and the wind speed and direction don't seem to update live or in frequent intervals. For free its worth a download but I wouldn't pay for this. You could get a lot more from a few of the free ad supported weather apps out there.
0451209338|5.0|This first entry in the series starring art restorer/Israeli agent Gabriel Allon is a satisfying thriller in the grand tradition.  Subtle, informative, intense, and involving-- who could ask for more?  And for an art lover, there is the added bonus of the always disconcerting tension between aesthetic beauty and the brutality that arguably makes it possible.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a first note, beyond a few sparse comments I am not going to give the plot of The Hunger Games away at all. If you want to know more about it just pick it up and read it for yourself. Or wait and go see the movie, although I always advocate reading the books in a series before seeing the movie. Let's face it, film just never will have the capacity to capture all of the things that go on in a beloved character's head the way the printed page does. But I digress, so back to the review.<br /><br />I've seen numerous comparisons between Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games and Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. Even I made the mistake of assuming she'd likely  taken a similar premise. However when I picked up The Hunger Games and started reading it I realized there is little resemblance between the two books outside of fact that both are about teenagers forced into a fight to the death by a totalitarian government bent on reminding its citizens that they can and will do anything to anyone who rebels. If anything this book actually reminded me more of the Stephen King novel The Long Walk, which pitted teenage boys in a death march to the finish with the last boy standing declared the winner.<br /><br />But all three books essentially have little to do with each other beyond likely being inspired by real life events throughout history that we've seen repeated time and again. The brutal Roman gladiator games and the child soldiers of Sierra Leone are just two real life examples that come to mind, let alone the fact that public be-headings and hangings used to be considered fit entertainment for the whole family in this world's not distant enough past. Having read all three books mentioned here in this review I think it's safe to say no one got the idea for their books from anyone else. Just that three different writers came up with three very different and excellent ways to use the past and their vivid imaginations to give us a window into common themes everyone can identifywith: why bending to a totalitarian government is always a bad idea, preserving one's humanity in the moment when it seems least likely one can do that, loyalty, love, friendship, family and of course, how the human spirit can refuse to be broken even in the worst of times.<br /><br />The Hunger Games delivers on all of these themes and more in spades. I was captivated by its heroine Katniss Everdeen from the first page and Suzanne Collins does a wonderful job of making you care not only for Katniss and her fate, but the lives of everyone that she touches. So of course I am adding Suzanne Collins and her trilogy to my list of authors and books that not only give me entertainment on those chilly nights when insomnia strikes, but leave me to ponder the larger themes of life in general. And maybe once I'm done with her trilogy I'll go make a return trip to those other two books I mentioned in my review as well. Each one stands alone on its own merit although I like the fact that I get to follow Katniss further into her journey from the girl in the woods to leader of a very much needed rebellion.
B005HSL626|5.0|really like this game,i like this better than the ipad version, you can earn the blades/backgrounds without sharing on facebook or twitter. and you get arcade and zen mode. really cool
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but I decided to read the first book because my nieces and their friends were reading them and posting how good they were on Facebook. I am almost 60 years old and thought I might not enjoy them as I knew they were written for a younger audience. I read the first 20 page Sample on my iPad and bought the first book as soon as I finished the last sample page. I could not put this book down and bought the next two books immediately. I cannot believe the way these books captured my interest and I was sad when I finished the last page, I wanted more. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0072X2O66|5.0|too many fans when they will buy this album or just give it a listen they will either look for dream theater or symphony x .. when you want DT or SX you go and buy one of their albums this is a new band with guys well known in the rock n roll industry try to listen to this album without the pre-judgment it will help that you play this cd then judge the music even if they are famous for killer albums in the 90s or earlier in the 2000s still this is a new band and bands need time to have a chemistry and they have their own chemistry depending on whos in the band and the approach that they take when they are creating new music \m/ rock on
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Unique and very engrossing.  Was happy to hear there might be more! :0)  I highly reccommend that if you're on the fence, you read this book.  I'm not telling a bunch of details about this omnibus, because the surprises are soooooo worth it!
140053271X|5.0|The best e-reader on the market. Simple as it says. Great tool for education, and I highly recommend Nook for anyone. Despite the insistance of Barnes and Nobel to make us believe that the use of this product is restricted to the U.S. users, I have to say, It works world wide.<br />As for the interface, is very intuitive and as it's name says, its very simple to use. It supports traditional epub, pdf, jpeg and to my surprise, it reads MS Office doc and docx files without any issue. The screen is way better and more gentle with the eye, than any kindle device. It's the fastest reader so fast. The only limitations are: a) the fact you can only use wifi to buy from the barnes and noble sotre. b) despite the kindle, it reads no mp3, and has no text to speech function. Consider to buy an additional memory card to increase the capacity of this device and to buy it from BluProton seller, they have one of the finest and most efficient services worldwide.
B00579EL18|5.0|Sony has been so generous to produce so many Metropolitan Opera broadcasts from the past.<br />In this economic climate, not to mention the decline of CD sales for downloading and internet piracy, this is another welcome addition to the series<br />Some listeners may claim this is not the first time on CD but that hardly matters. Sony is major.<br />Don Carlo is my favorite Verdi from this period..It is so rich in melody and invention. It rarely goes astray considering it's length.<br />The characters I find clearly defined, focused and filled with passion.<br />Don Carlo deserves the best singers available (and budget) not always easy to pull together.<br />This recording offers up some of the strongest voices of 1964 especially the men.<br />Franco Corelli is simply  at his vocal best..he practically walks off with this performance.<br />I can't say enough about the opulence of his voice. It was golden. The rest of this strong cast works almost as well.<br />Nicolea Herlea certainly keeps Corelli on his toes. What a beautiful Rodrigo he was. His Met career seemed so short.<br />Giorgio Tozzi is Philip ll..excellently sung if too melodramatic for some..The grand inquisitor scene (Hermann Uhde) could have been stronger.<br />Irene Dalis another singer you can count on to deliver with passion and stage presence. Her voice wasn't always on target but her performance here is an exciting one.<br />Now I come to one of my very favorite sopranos of all time Leonie Rysanek. I could never have enough of her. In this case, however,I do not find the role of Elisabeth to sit in the best part of her voice.<br />I appreciate the performance but sometimes the crooning sounds a little excessive...Then there is the top of her voice and the volume of sound which is always breathtaking.<br />The conductor Kurt Adler was a Met favorite...I'll take Kurt Adler and Fausto Cleva anytime.
B000002KDO|5.0|When I was a young kid in the 80's, I had a terrific grandmother who used to take me to flea markets and yard sales every weekend.  One particularly special weekend, I think around the 4th grade, I came across two vinyl albums at one of these sales that intrigued me.  One was Paranoid, and the other was Master of Reality.  By then, I knew who Black Sabbath was from two sources; my older cousins, who I looked up to like heroes, and who loved Ozzy Osbourne, and my other grandma, who was also terrific but watched a lot of religious shows on TV.  On one of these, a preacher did a series about rock music in which he played samples of a few old Sabbath songs.  Not confused in the least by the disparate nature of my two sources of discovery, I knew I loved how the music sounded, so when I got the chance to own it for the first time, I jumped.  As it turned out, I had just bought two of the most important albums in rock history at around age 9.  Did I mention how great my grandmother was?<br /><br />Master of Reality shines in every way.  Tony Iommi's riffs are never-ending on this one, and the darker guitar tone than the first two albums adds a sinister touch to tracks with eerie qualities like Children of the Grave, Lord of This World, and Into the Void.  In the vocal department, Ozzy was at the peak of his abilities.  Forming melodies from the ingenious simplicity of Iommi's riffs, he wails out one eternally memorable line after another.  His voice is key to some of Black Sabbath's all-time classics from this album, beginning with the legendary Sweet Leaf and the relentless groove-fest of After Forever, then continuing on to the other songs mentioned above, all of which are staples in any Sabbath set list or best-of collection, and the ballad Solitude.  Additionally, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward underscore the proceedings with a thumping pulse worthy of any powerhouse blues band, providing the swing and the drive that helped the group create the genre of heavy metal with this and their two prior releases.  Combining these elements resulted in a timeless album that has directly influenced an infinite number of bands and musicians.  Master of Reality deserves immeasurable respect.this and their two prior releases.

Until about a week after I got it I started using it and had to make sure the cord was completely straight. Its like the wiring had already messed up and would only work a certain way. Its not my MacBook either because I tried someone else's and it worked perfectly. Long story short, works fine for a week, then you find out its not very durable.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Frankly, with the cost of the Amazon Kindle Fire I purchased, I couldn't justify spending even more money by getting a leather case or cover. However, with the price of the Kindle Fire, I definitely wanted to get it some proper protection. So, I opted for a [[ASIN:B005V2EVBQ Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Black]].<br /><br />I'm glad I made this purchase. It's not beautiful; neither is it an eyesore. It's very lightweight and yet suprizingly strong. The inside has a protective lining and the outside has a \\"rubberized feel\\" (so it doesn't slip out of your hands)<br /><br />The front cover folds back on itself and provides a well-angled stand for easy viewing.<br /><br />Getting a Kindle? Get a good cover, such as this one.

0385534639|5.0|It was love at first page when I began to read The Night Circus. Absolutely everything about the book was magical, from the characters to the vision of the circus to the long-term feud between illusionists to the uncommon friendships between people from all walks of life to the agonized but achingly sweet love story of Celia and Marco. I loved how the novel focuses on the beauty and intricacy of story and the creative process itself. And I luxuriated in all of the rich sensual details of costume, architecture, artwork, food, lighting, scent... All I can say in closing is that I now count myself among the reveurs and will follow the circus the world over if it one day appears in our humble realm!

B00783NPVI|5.0|I was very surprised by how fast this movie came to my house. I ordered it and the next day it was at my door. The quality of it is amazing, from reading the description by the seller I was already intrigued but once I actually received it it was everything the description said and then some. I am very satisfied with this item and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a Twilight fan. You won't be disappointed
B0062NAX1U|5.0|No doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. My brother sent this to my husband with a note to watch it and pass it on to another Dad. We both LOVED it. Definitely need tissues but as corny as it sounds this movie can change the way you live. I am buying a copy to keep and lend out (but be sure I get back) as I know we will want to watch this again as a reminder. Excellent movie with a message.
B003O86FMW|2.0|This seemed like a rough draft.  Fabulous story, great new characters introduced, but the majority of the book is a monologue of what is going on inside Katniss's head.  It goes on and on and on and on...There was no effort put into this book.  It had the potential to be every bit as good as the first book.

The quality of the book is excellent, even my boy is pritty rough to all his toys and books, it still in very good condition. Highly recommend. Must have for the kids who does not love to read very much.

B004EPZ00C|2.0|I LOVE Amazon reviews. That's why I'm going through the trouble of leaving MY review. YOU CAN'T TRUST MOVIE CRITICS! The absolute worst movies in the world can still find some critic somewhere that is either brain-dead or morally bankrupt - or FINANCIALLY bankrupt - that will put his/her name to a glowing review that is an utter, baseless LIE! AMAZON REVIEWS, by contrast are mostly just people giving their honest opinion, with no money being slid under the table.<br /><br />The critic for this movie called it \\"HYSTERICALLY FUNNY\\". No. What is hysterically funny is the fact that everyone now knows that you, movie critic, have no integrity. If I were a bit drunk, having a great day and were a tad more mentally confused, I MIGHT go so far as to say this movie was mildly, sporadically, childishly \\"amusing\\". No...that's going too far. Call it \\"NOT totally devoid of humor\\".<br /><br />I always liked Rowan Atkinson a bit. Just a bit. British humor - aside from Monty Python - always seemed to me to lag behind American humor by a few decades. (Maybe 'cause we get the shows 20 years after they're filmed.) This movie may show Atkinson at his prime. Unfortunately, I think his prime was about 1970, and he doesn't appear to have updated his material. I have seen every one of his slapsticky-type gags hundreds of times in hundreds of movies since then, and most were done hundreds of times better, fresher, more original and FUN NI ER. That's about it. Old, tired gags, lackluster-ly performed.<br /><br />I only watched the first half of the movie before I trashed it. Now, just think about those totally lame TV show \\"comedies\\" that are anything but, and think about how you will just sit there watching it, HOPING that something will soon strike your funny bone. Just HOW BAD does it have to be for you to totally give up and turn it off? This movie was THAT BAD.

B007JUWM64|2.0|This is one of the worst movies that i think has been produced in 2011. I mean what was going on! The script was boring and cheesy the acting sucked. I was very disappointed in Orlando bloom acting. He seemed like he was trying to imitate Johnny Depp in parts then this random mean gay guy in others. This move was a total waist of good money and time. Even the comedic relief wasn't even funny! Horrible DON'T WATCH!!
0316056863|2.0|Let me preface this by saying that I love Tina Fey.  I'm a conservative and I know there is give and take with the little jabs among parties.  I found her to be quite respectful of Sarah Palin in her book and as far as some of the insults people make about Tina Fey and how she answered them, classic!  She's obviously a gifted comedy writer and I find her to be one of the most attractive women out there (I like brunettes in glasses that are funny...it's rare).  I found the majority of the book and tone were all coming back to one major point: Tina Fey is pissed off at all men for everything we've done to hold women down or make them feel they have to conform to a certain point of view.  I get it...but to keep coming back to this point every chapter got so boring after a while that I lost interest in the jokes and finished the book out of obligation to not half-assing.  Also, the little snipes here and there (example: Clarence Thomas creating sexual harassment in the early 90's) seemed so dumb for an obviously intelligent woman.  I mean let's be real here: she was gushing over a phone call she got from Bill Clinton after she did a skit on the 2008 campaign.  Hey Tina, newsflash: Bill Clinton has been sexually harassing women for real since before you got a bowl haircut.  Things like this discredit her intelligence and frankly are a turnoff.  I appreciate how you represent you POV proudly but you don't have to make conservatives feel like crap for their beliefs.  At the very least, you could respect your parents and recognize that maybe you're not right about everything.  But then again, would that be a man holding a woman down?  Ooooh, that's a no-no.  I probably wouldn't recommend this book but I love 30 Rock.  Stick with that, Tina and don't lose the glasses.  You're perfect the way you are, I'll give you that :)
0385344228|5.0|I have always loved legal thrillers. But it's been a long, long time since I found one that excited me as much as this one. Many modern legal thrillers aren't really courtroom dramas; instead they get caught up into the investigation, and the protagonist becomes the next potential victim, yadda, yadda. This was an actual courtroom drama. A mother and father dealing with the fact that their son has been arrested for the murder of another boy. Some other reviews have complained about the courtroom scenes, but for me, they were some of the best parts of the book. If you like courtroom fiction, then get this book. The human side of the drama was also well drawn and extremly well written. The father refuses to consider that his son might be guilty even in the face of pretty compelling evidence. The mother is more prone to question her son's innocence, but has trouble getting the dad to talk about it. The dialogue was sharp and realistic, the plot exciting. The author keeps his readers wondering themselves . . . IS he guilty? You can see that the verdict could go either way. In addition to the main plot, there is the family secret that the father's father AND grandfather were both violent killers, a fact he kept from his wife. They grapple with the concept of a \\"murder gene\\" and wonder if their son has inherited it. Altogether a great read, and well worth the money and your time. Especially if you are a fan of well written, credible courtroom dramas.

1451683405|3.0|Let me start by saying I am a very big fan of Harris. I have read all his books, seen pretty much everything he's done on youtube and even got tickets to an event in Mexico because I was in the country at the time (I couldn't go-I had a last minute work issue come up) :(<br />Anyway I got the PDF book the day it came out. I tried reading it 3 or 4 times and although it started really well it quickly went downhill and I got bored. I bought the audio version and just finished listening to it. At 1 hour and 19 minutes it's very short-especially for $10. While listening I often winced and thought out loud during a part of the book talking about choosing water over OJ. \\"Mmmm well, you chose water because you didn't want orange juice because your body didn't need the citric taste, didn't want the sugar and calories of orange juice and that is because of a lifestyle you live/the exercise you may be doing at the time, the needs of the body based on the lifestyle you choose to live\\" or  \\"you just ate something sugary and more sugar would be too much for you\\"  OR etc...Not that deep.<br /><br />I did, however, thoroughly enjoy the parts about people not being able to make the decision(s) to do bad things and how that could be based on many things out of their control. The other one was when each of us has a eureka moment or gets out of our stupor and does something about it. Why did that happen then and not the day before? What triggered the \\"choice\\" to change? It's fascinating. It's also annoying that Harris brings it up but never gives any clues or ideas as to WHY/HOW it comes up which would have been very interesting.<br /><br />The book just didn't convince me. I guess I expected better but I don't know. Maybe I'll listen to it a couple more times but def not my fav.<br /><br />**Also about 15 minutes of the audiobook at the 50 minute mark is literally verbatim what is written in the Moral Landscape which was quite annoying.<br /><br />So, if you've read The Moral Landscape and want to get the gist of this book, read his blog and don't bother with the book.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Papa

B005PK1G76|5.0|This product is just what I was looking for that happened to come at a great price too!  I have a First Years Wave- Urban Life stroller that does not have a cup holder (which I knew before I purchased it) and so I was looking to buy one.  I wished the product offered the dimensions because I was concerned this Buggy Buddy may not stretch wide enough to fit the 20\\" bar on the stroller.  I bought it anyway and was so pleased that it fit.  The velcro straps overlap a little more than an inch on each side which is perfect, but if your stroller is wider than 20\\", it may not stay-- especially if you will have heavier items in there because you won't have a lot of slack in the velcro straps and it will sag if not come undone altogether.  Otherwise, the functionality is great and looks great.  I am very pleased with this product!

1932100385|5.0|As the sub-title suggests, this is truly is the most comprehensive review of hundreds of scientifically obtained results ever compiled in laymen's terms. Author T. Colin Campbell, himself a research scientist with impeccable creds, has put forth irrefutable evidence that diet has the greatest influence on health of any other factors by far. This is a very readable book, not a medical tomb, and it leads the reader down Campbell's own difficult path to these conclusions during a time when almost no one wanted to hear about it.<br />  I \\"tested the water\\", buying the eBook version first just to see if I could get my head around it and have since bought several paperbound and one hard cover to distribute to others.

B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Didn't seem to use that much space. Looks brilliant on my Fire! My old weather app looks pretty sad by comparison, and I never used the widgets anyway.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Of course if you know the songs they play you will recognize them.  It is a very good take on the originals specially if you like the cello.<br /><br />I saw the video on youtube and I liked it enough to purchase the cd.<br /><br />I do not regret it but I do like the cello a lot, if you do not you may not enjoy all the songs.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Thank God this was free, but there is no widget for the home screen...so what's the point? it looks nice but it should have a widget.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Except for a couple of weaker tracks toward the end, this is a highly listenable album. Funny, but I played this after a recent Jason Mraz album, a solo singer-songwriter about 40 years younger than Neil. It was just okay, though Mraz gets a lot more attention than old Neil these days because Mraz is trendy. But I found the songs lacking. Then, I slipped this 05 Neil Young effort into the car cd player and, wow, what a relief. First, the incomparable vocals of Neil Young are unlike anyone else. Then, the instrumentation: sparse and just right. Nothing artificial sounding. Then, the songs: memorable melodies. This is a master at work. Yes, this may be a minor work in the master's canon. But it is so much better than so much else of what is current today.
B007M6P01O|5.0|Outstanding!  This episode tied up some lose ends (like what did Dr. Jenner say?!) and got rid of some periphery characters while leaving the audience dying to see the next season.  The introduction of a new character, Michonne, beloved by comic book fans, and apparently, the only person who knows how to live with the walkers, should make for another awesome season.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Love the move Christine.  Since it is about a Plymouth<br />automoblile and I a member of the National Plymouth<br />Owner's Club the movie makes it more interesting and<br />exciting to watch.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really easy to play this version. I really like pplaying in Vegas mode. Wished I'd win more but other than that...great game!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|there is no reason for this app to be do big it isn't even the best weather app reduce the size and I might try it again
B002JCSRKC|1.0|I bought these because they looked normal. I didnt need rainboots that had silly designs on them. They looked real nice online but my order looked like plastic shoes, something a live barbie doll would wear. They were too big for my feet. I am returning them tomorrow.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|i first heard Mumford and sons on the Grammy awards show.  I bought their album the next day.  I find their music very enjoyable...there is something to be said for musicians playing instruments and being artists,  there are many different types of songs on this album and they deserve all the praise they have received.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|very beautiful graphics but info is so<br />off base....it doesn't even show the correct time of day...frustrating good thing j didn't pay for it of I would demand a refund!!!
B004HAG40O|5.0|i started listening to the decemberists after it was suggested to me after buying a Mumford and sons cd.  I have enjoyed their music sense.  this cd, along with the crane wife is my favorite.  it has for stand alone songs than their other albums.  worth a listen!
B000BBOV8U|3.0|Went t a Bryan Adams concert in January and had forgotten about all the songs Bryan has.<br />Inspired me t order this cd. Too syrupy. The concert was excellent. IMO. this album was over produced.<br />Check Bryan out live a very talented man.
B00065MDSG|5.0|Ever since being frightened by that screaming red face I've always been intrigued and drawn to this delightfully twisted band... LTIA, however, stands as the masterpiece of a band with a lineup that has always been my favorite...Wetton, Fripp, Bruford, Cross and Muir. The first three were all solid, but the addition of Muir and his whacky purcussive additions just complemented Bruford's already excellent chops (I wished Bruford could have played for BOTH Yes and KC - Yes was never the same after he left). Anyway, getting back to the album - won't say much more than what's already been said - this is an acid-trip album with eery, sleepy, disturbing and head-banging ferocity that showcases Fripp and his mates at their best.
0439023521|2.0|Either Katniss is a perpetual liar/unreliable narrator, or lobotomies were free for most characters.<br /><br />#1. The hungry ignore how she gets food. Katniss says she's one of few who hunt--the rest haven't learnt archery or spear-throwing or fishing. They aren't desperate enough to creep outside the fence, where it's brimming with food and life. \\"Roots to dig, greens to gather, fish...\\" And even a strawberry patch! If Katniss' father--a regular coal miner--became a good hunter, why didn't the starving masses copy him?<br /><br />#2. Katniss' dad would've made them rich. The food he'd fetched would have made him a lot wealthier than a miner, so WHY was he still mining, instead of hunting full-time?<br /><br />#3. Hunger doesn't drive these people to boldness? \\"Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife.\\" (Pg 6). But the Peacekeepers \\"protect\\" successful hunters instead of punishing (shooting) them, and Prehistoric men turned sharpened sticks into spears to hunt and defend against sabre-tooth tigers! Desperate people would hunt like this to feed their children, or even with pitchforks. It's 74 years since the Games started, and hunting/gathering outside is STILL rare?<br /><br />#4. Animals (meat) are safe inside D12? Katniss tells us there's a lot of livestock INSIDE District 12 and that all are apparently safe from being stolen and roasted. Pigs (Peeta's), goats (Prim's & Goat Man's herd), cattle (the soup lady will tell the Peacemakers her soup is beef), horses (to pull the wagons), sheep (Katniss trades for wool), and enough leather for shoes, jackets, etc. Yep, starved coal miners and orderly teens limp past Prim's goat on their way home to their starving families every night and ignore it!<br /><br />#5. Everyone's a lawbreaker, but they're terrified of breaking the law? The reason Katniss gives for the above is that it's against the law to steal, the punishment being death, which would be scary if they weren't being killed slowly, anyway. And she *also* says, \\"...and who hasn't broken the law?\\" Whiplash! Which is it? 200 years ago in England, the poor knew they'd be sentenced to death or shipped to hard labour in Australia for being caught stealing bread or hunting on private property, but hunger twisted their arms.<br /><br />#6. Starving people don't make their own veggie gardens? Outside the fence are potatoes, carrots, beets, parsnips, turnips (roots), berry bushes, leafy green veg, herbs and strawberries, all growing hardily without human nurturing, so the seeds/cuttings are right there to cultivate from! Pg.34 has Peeta's yard with a \\"garden bed, not yet planted for the spring\\" and Pg.42 K's hungry mother grows herbs, so growing food is legal in D.12 and no one is persecuted in any way for it. Why isn't the whole of D12 swollen in greenery from these hardy crops?<br /><br />#7. Katniss is well-fed but hungry, poor but sells what everyone wants? She says she still goes to bed hungry at times, so hungry she's needed to put her name in the Hunger Games hat extra times every year for grain and oil. Yet she *also* says their goat (her \\"gold mine\\"!) provides so much milk for them to drink that they occasionally have enough left over to make cheese, and that she brings food, including meat, home on a daily basis (Pg.377).<br /><br />#8. Miners that keep the Capital running on coal are so hungry they can't mine? If the above is true, then miners go to bed even HUNGRIER than Katniss, every SINGLE night, thus they're seriously frail, endangering D.12's ability to dig coal for their overlords = the main theme is a PLOT HOLE!<br /><br />#9. The Capitol doesn't care about production? A place of technology and comfort, they use electricity (from coal) to maintain that lifestyle. Understandable. The other districts would also be heavy electricity users for their different productions, so coal would be in VERY high demand since no other fuel is being produced. Wouldn't PRODUCTION be the overlords supreme goal? Fear of the Capitol is a done-deal already, since all children must have their names in the hat for the Hunger Games. So the Capitol doesn't have to shoot itself in the foot by having workers who can barely walk in order to maintain control.<br /><br />#10. Miners with serious illnesses keep the Capitol running? Living mostly on grains and oil would mean these precious workers are severely deficient in Vit.C = scurvy (weakness, anemia, bleeding organs, heart disease), folic acid (anemia, irritability, memory problems, manic depression, bone fractures, low libido, fetal problems) and iron (fatigue, difficulty maintaining body temperature, decreased immune function, anemia). HOW ARE THEY REPRODUCING, let alone working?<br /><br />11. Given the laws of supply and demand, Katniss would be wealthy. She is one of just a few who are selling the rarest and most desired product to eight thousand people (including the wealthier Peacekeepers) who are all desperate for her meat. However, she trades this commodity that's hundreds of times more valuable than the meat in our stores today, for shoelaces, wool, bread or salt. Lobotomy! Even the organs/heads/feet would fetch high prices! Her mother, being a supposed healer, should know that broth made from boiling fish-heads is an iodine-rich remedy for energy/illnesses, and boiled bones/hooves makes a gelatine and mineral rich broth that boosts the immune system, is an anti-inflammatory, a hormone regulator, and for skin and joint/tendon health. The people in D.12 would *greatly* need these remedies!<br /><br />#12. Where does she find the time? Every day, Katniss goes to school, hunts in the mountains, sells/trades her extra food in the Hob (where she \\"makes most of her money\\") and (I assume) guts and skins her kill for her mother to cook.<br /><br />#13. The overloads care about schooling the kids (up to 16, at least) they starve and deny futures to. The Capitol pay teachers and other staff while providing classrooms, \\"sports activities\\" (Pg.13), and \\"music assembly\\" (Pg.366) for children who could otherwise be mining. Poor kids as young as 4, in the Victorian era, were uneducated and mined coal under a MUCH less sinister government. \\"Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic reading and maths, most of our instruction is coal related.\\" Why do non-mining kids, like the Mayor's daughter & Peeta, have to know all about it? Why do future miners even need to know anything about coal that can't be taught on-the-job? Moreover, why do *they* need to be taught even basic reading and maths by their evil overlords?<br /><br />#14. Or ARE good futures produced from this schooling? Katniss lectures Prim about staying in school on page 42, as if it can improve Prim's future, as if it's a choice Prim has not to go. Yet this is supposed to be a place where mining coal is people's main avenue for income...after the age of 16/17.<br /><br />#14. Why didn't Katniss give Prim advice to help her life without her? \\"Prim, forget school that'll get your nowhere. Make and tend a big vegetable garden of berries, greens and roots. That'll be your carbs, so you don't need to enter the Hunger Games for grain rations! Mom, teach Prim reading and maths, and tend the garden with her. Gale, can you trap some baby rabbits for them to breed their own, easy meat in cages over grass?\\" (since no one would steal them). \\"With the money you get from selling extra food, buy more goats to sell milk and cheese, too.\\" In fact, why weren't they doing all this all along? Why weren't others? Ah, those darned lobotomies!<br /><br />#15. Did I miss a law for dark haired, grey-eyed people to mine, or else? What about all the other jobs needed in D12? The majority of D.12 are supposed to be coal miners who get paid very little for their hard, dangerous work, yet there's plenty of other jobs they could do (and that would NEED doing! So...each new generation of coal miners choose not to be meat-hunters, bakers, butchers, teachers, prostitutes, pub staff, Moonshine producers, grave-diggers, police/peacekeepers, staff of the Mayor, fruit growers & dryers (raisins on Pg. 37), hide-tanners (all that leather), fabric producers & dyers (for pretty dresses, \\"pink\\" ribbons, trousers, blouses, babies' diapers, sanitary pads, etc--What do they make it from? Cotton? Hemp?), cotton/hemp farmers (unless these starving people can afford to import all that in), animal farmers (pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, horses), wagon builders (pg.48), clothes washers, wool spinners, makers/importers of school & office supplies (paper, pencils, chalk, text books?), herbalists/healers (Katniss' mother), soap or toothbrush producers, black-market businesses, carpenters, plumbers, electricity company workers, electricians, electric bulb & wire & switch manufacturers, steel workers (knives, fences, pots, ovens, nails, sewing needles), guards for herds of livestock?, shoe/boot-makers, garbage men (rubbish bin's emptied on Pg.34), etc, etc.<br /><br />#16. The Capitol called the games \\"HUNGER\\" yet they don't want any of the hungry to believe any of them are so hungry they actually die from hunger. HUH? Pg. 33: \\"Starvation is never the cause of death officially. It's always the flu, or exposure to pneumonia. But that fools no one.\\"<br /><br />#17. Which district pumps oil? The amount of fuel to make and transport all these products of \\"industries\\" back and forth across the country means fuel needs are immense. They have hovercrafts, trucks, tractors and trains... I thought the trains, at least, must've been coal-produced-electric (given their high speeds), but then the train on page 540 stopped for \\"fuel\\"! Not even trains today do that (electric). Soooooooooo...?<br /><br />#18. THE WRITING.<br />So many adverbs. So many cliches (\\"silent as a stone\\" + \\"fresh as a raindrop\\" + \\"chilled to the bone\\" + \\"shaking like a leaf\\"). So may dialogue tags. If it's just two people in a conversation, we know who's speaking after the first dialogue tag/action beat! This drove me nuts:<br /><br />\\"Yes, there's usually some,\\" I say.<br />\\"Katniss, it's just hunting. You're the best hunter I know,\\" says Gale.<br />\\"It's not just hunting. They're armed. They think,\\" I say.<br />\\"So do you. And you've had more practice. Real practice,\\" he says. \\"You know how to kill.\\"<br />\\"Not people,\\" I say.<br />\\"How different can it be, really?\\" says Gale grimly.<br /><br />THE GOOD...................................<br /><br />Indeed, I thought there were a lot of good things in tHG, despite all the above. I really liked the author's prose and pacing. The \\"little duck\\" comments in the beginning with Prim were so cute and creative, I was drawn in right away. And the cat and her hating each other got my attention as well--very unique. I loved the creativity in how simply the author wrote, \\"Entrails. No hissing. It's the closest we'll come to love.\\" These are what spurred me to click \\"buy now\\" ASAP. Loved having a strong female lead who wasn't bitchy or whinny! I think this confuses a lot of writers who aim for strong, but Katniss was created with talent. The rare trope/pairing of \\"Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy\\" made the read more interesting, and I think that, too, took talent to pull off. The characters of Gale and Prim were my favourites, and I got teary just reading the Kindle sample where Katniss substituted herself in Prim's place. After the sample is where it went down-hill for me--leaving district 12 and the characters I was most invested in.<br /><br />Personally, I would have found it a fascinating read without the Hunger Games, but rather a story of how they cope in District 12 (minus lobotomies!), how their survival progresses and how their relationships grow and are challenged in that interesting setting.(up to 16, at least) they starve and deny futures to. The Capitol pay teachers and other staff while providing classrooms, \\"sports activities\\" (Pg.13), and \\"music assembly\\" (Pg.366) for children who could otherwise be mining.

B000F8O4DQ|5.0|My words won't really add to what's already been said here - this is ELO's best album... a rocking album, a melancholy album, kind of an eerie album too. It never gets old...it's a classic album and could be arguably a top 100 of all time albums if Billboard or Rolling Stone ever got their lists right. Probably a top 20 album of all time IMHO. Miss this lineup as well - Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan , Tandy and the strings guys...what a cool, odd mixture of musicians - but it really worked!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is one of the traditional christmas movies that we always watch and enjoy.  It is really fosters good will and shows the power of caring and kindness and faith.  Thanks Amazon.

0385534639|5.0|This was a lovely book. The characters were distant yet very real, and the mixed up timeline actually added to the way the story was told rather than distracted and confused as I had initially expected. The illusions were particularly spectacular: they seemed emotionally charged, beautiful, and somehow realistic all at the same time. The second person vignettes interspersed in the story brought out the way the circus was supposed to feel. I loved that.<br /><br />Despite being about magic, I thought the book grounded and relatable.<br /><br />Definitely one to reread.
0439023521|5.0|At first the idea of putting an arena full of children to fight each other until death seemed unfathomable, particularly as a book aimed as young adult reading.  But this book turned out to be much more than that.  It was a story of sacrifice, loyalty, determination, and love.  It wasn't all about the fighting and wasn't overly graphic and feel it would be liked by a variety of age groups.  It held my attention from the beginning and it was hard to put down.  I'm anxious to see the movie but I'm afraid some of the thoughts and emotions of the main character, Katniss, may be hard to portray through a movie.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Tubemate is one of my favorite apps and has been for a long time. I would be lost without it.

1400077915|5.0|This was my first foray into the world of Alice Munro's short stories and I am hooked, as they say, line and sinker, and I couldn't be more pleased. These beautiful stories are so well written and straight forward that I couldn't break away. Admittedly, I was confused by the format of the book at first since it is a collection of short stories but the second, third and fourth chapters were a continuation of the same story. Once I realized that I was reading short stories I was amazed. They stood alone so perfectly yet fit together wonderfully. I experienced love, joy, pain and regret in these stories that I had never felt so clearly before. I will be reading more from Alice Munro in the future with no doubt.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|very cute and mind snagging game....please make sure that u look back at the map frequently cause you'd ll be going thrum each season quite a bit!!!
0143119419|5.0|This book is enlightening and entertaining beyond my expectation. It is a book I have trouble putting down even on a sunny Sunday morning.... Very high quality. Worth every penny.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am an avid reader that happens to have a soft spot for erotica/BDSM novels.<br /><br />I knew going into this book, that it was erotica-lite, so keeping that in mind, I went at it.<br /><br />What can I say, I did like the relationship the characters developed, it was charming and kinda easy to get lost in the word play they have. As sappy, and unrealistic as the settings and circumstances are, it was easy to overlook.<br /><br />My only real issue with the book as a whole is I wish instead of following this loving/real relationship it goes into, where Christian has to compromise his life-style to accommodate and fit Anastasia into, they would have actually had a real BDSM. I kept hoping it would actual turn for the dark, and stop all the cheesy lovefest that develops. I get it, a girl wants to be swept away, be the all important cure for a broken guy.<br /><br />It ends up very watered down and I spent more time dealing with Anastasia's \\"Oh my\\" and inner goddess, then unleashing Christian's full potential, which is a shame, cause he would have made a hell of a dom to meet.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much after renting it \\"on demand\\", that I ordered the book for my e-reader, since it had been years that I'd read the book. After reading the book again, I ordered the movie. I'm sure I'll be enjoying this movie for years to come! Loved it!!!
B004SIFYYW|5.0|I am very happy with what i got. It was my first ever purchase and now im hooked. I would definitely recommend.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|I bought this because my husband really wanted to see it after watching the trailer.  I'm not a big fan of shoot-em-up movies...whether they are westerns, crime movies, or war movies...but I have to admit this one was good enough to keep even my attention through the end of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is supposedly based on a \\"real\\" story about aliens that attacked Los Angeles in the 1040s.  The first part of the movie sets up the storyline which explains that a platoon of marines are risking their lives to rescue some trapped civilians in Los Angeles during this alien invasion.  The remainder 95% is pure action.<br /><br />If you like action war movies, you will love this one.  Lots of fighting, lots of killing, happy ending.  What is really refreshing is that they managed to make a very realistic movie without all the blood and gore so many movies depend on these days.  Killings are not close up, and even the aliens are only seen at a distance. My husband watched it again the next night with my 11-year-old grandson who liked it as well.  He pointed out that this movie has nowhere near the amount of violence in it that our grandson's video games have.  There are a few swear words (which I'm never thrilled about), but they are very limited and nothing terribly offensive...no \\"F\\" word (which is where I draw the line).  There are a couple of human-interest stories about the characters, and the movie has just a hint of \\"Independence Day\\" flavor about it (without the humor).  I won't spoil the end, but you'll know what I mean when you watch it.<br /><br />All-in-all, it was well worth buying.  I'm not sure where we were when this came out in theaters, but I'm surprised we hadn't heard of the movie till recently.  I guess it didn't win any awards for story or acting, but the special effects make up for anything that might be lacking there.<br /><br />This set comes with both the regular DVD and the BluRay disks.
0553801473|1.0|I am an avid reader of historical, speculative, and fantasy fiction, and I'll check out any author who invites me into an alternate world. So please don't think I'm dissing the genre here.<br />As I read through the first four books in this series, I became increasingly resentful of abusive language about women, vicious violence & war, and, speaking plainly, just what the heck was going on. Characters are introduced as if we already know them, but they come out of anywhere without any context. Yes, 'sprawling epic' it is, but it just isn't Tolkein, so don't be fooled by the hype! Martin tried and failed.<br />It just doesn't seem possible, but this fifth book in the series is worse than the previous four, overburdened by eroticized violence and endless descriptions of what this or that character is wearing. If you want well-written and well-conceived fiction, this is not the series of books to pick up, and would definitely be a disappointing waste of your time and money.

0375869026|5.0|If I had one word to describe this book it would be \\"beautiful.\\" At the risk of sounding corny, this is a lovely book. I cried at the end, not from sadness, but from reading something so touching.<br /><br />August Pullman was born with severe facial deformity, the kind that causes people to turn away from the sight of him. The story begins when in the 5th grade he goes to his first school, having been home-schooled before this.<br /><br />His story is told through the points of view of several characters giving the reader insight into how August has affected their life.<br /><br />The only thing that took away from the believability of the story was how perfect his family was. There were no financial problems, no domestic problems, nothing troubling at all. I didn't mind this, though, because August's lot in life is the opposite of perfect therefore I found myself comforted in the fact that his home life was loving and protective.<br /><br />His teachers at school are also perfect, but again, as a reader, I liked knowing he had one less thing to worry about.<br /><br />The author is a master at weaving in plot points that tie up very nicely in the end. I will look for her future books and hope they are as beautiful as this one.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is truly a delight for both parents and kids. Both my kids love it, (ages 3 and 4). The soundtrack is awesome, and will make you want to get up off the couch and dance! I play the songs on youtube for the kids (and me) even when they're not watching the movie, we love them that much! If you're thinking of giving this as a gift, think no more!
B004EWEX9Y|4.0|Greatly appreciate the Apple Composite AV cable ZML and it works well.  We are now watching movies dowloaded to my ipad on our living room TV.  Wonderful!  The cable is long enought to allow the iPad to sit on a nearby table.  One point of dissapointment:  For some reason they would not send the cable to my home address on Guam.  Guam is a US Territory.  It is included in the US Postal System (a letter or package costs the same as it does to any other US location).  It is also included in the US numbering system.  Guam is a part of the US of A!  So, why not send it to my US Territory address?  Instead, I had the cable sent to my Dad in Virginia.  Then, he forwarded it to me via the US Postal Service.  Hey, be patriotic and include all of America!  Hope that was just an oversight and not a deliberate decision to cut out parts of the US.  Again, the cable is great.<br />-Mikel

B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie is a good syfy,action, adventure movie. That's all it tries to be and nothing else. And it is stunningly beautiful, and when I looked on imdb for the budget, it said like 237 million. There's no way that's true. If that were true, then spiderman 3 would've cost more, than this. A lot of movies would've been more expensive if that were true. Sam Worthington is convincing as an ex marine confined to a wheelchair. No one is perticulary great in this movie(no awards should've been given) but everyone keeps this movie int tact, and each person brings their own thing to the movie. I laugh when I think that Joel David Moore from Hatchet is one of the bigger characters in this movie. Michele Rodriguez delivers in this movie as the rouge pilot helping the Naive people. I didn't ever like Michele Rodrigeuz in Fast and the Furious(original, not the 9 year later remake,) but she starts to grow on ya. Her character in that movie, she tries to be so cool, and it doesn't work too well. And James Cameron brought in one of previous stars from Aliens, the great Sigourney Weaver. She's good in this movie, but not great. It almost seems like she's missing something. Like Jake(Sam Worthington) says that she's being nice to him, but she doesn't mean it. Later we see them acting like really good friends. But disregard any reviews about, missing footage, or no special features, or Dances with Wolves comparison. Yes the story is cliche' but when you're being entertained , does it really matter folks. But sit down, shut up, and marvel at James Cameron's beautiful blockbuster experience, Avatar.

B003Y5H5F6|1.0|This movie, by any reasonable standard, is a one- or two-star effort. The plot is a complete mess that jumps from one random scene to another and the ending feels like it was written by a group of preschoolers. It's far and away the weakest entry of the series (and to qualify that, in my view Rise of the Lycans is the best, followed by the original). I was really annoyed by just how awful and pointless this movie was.<br /><br />Now, as for these ridiculous 5-star reviews, you'll note that IMDB also gives this movie four to five stars, almost certainly by the same people that are writing these Amazon reviews. If you want to get a reality check, go to rotten tomatoes, which contains legitimate reviews by professional reviewers, and you'll see that the movie gets 1-2 stars.<br /><br />Cue the flabbergasted movie studio employees telling me that I'm wrong.

You are hooked from the first chapter by the characters Ana and Mr Grey's \\"relationship\\" I could not put the book down and read all three books in 5 days!!!!

I just can't wait to see if EL James will write additional books about these characters if so I'm sold!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of, if not the best post-apocalyptic stories I have ever read. It is not very often that I find a book that manages to maintain suspension of disbelief while keeping me completely enraptured. Wool does both of those things and so much more.<br /><br />There have been many fictional works in many mediums that have taken on the challenge of telling the story of life below ground after the end of things. They all pale in comparison to the telling that is Wool. If you have played games such as Fallout or Paranoia this story will at first seem very familiar to you, but you are in for some amazing surprises.<br /><br />I cannot encourage you enough to purchase this story. It doesn't matter if you are an old timer or totally new to the genre, buy this and enjoy some of best writing seen in decades.
0545305497|5.0|I bought this series for my Girlfriend. She literally can not put it down!<br />We ended up sending the first book to her brother, who lives in Texax, and he read it over the course of a day.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|No need for another overly intellectual movie review. Just want you all to know I personally loved this movie for all the emotion and sentimental scenes that teach us that love and hope endures forever. If not for Mr. Spielberg who then is making this kind of beautiful throwback movie to the good old days? I had to watch The Black Stallion as soon as I got home. War Horse is a wonderful film of heart, blood, sweat and the biggie-tears!!!! War Horse II anyone?

B005LAIGRS|4.0|You're in a position that requires very little of you and have been for some time. Then you hear your significant other is getting a new job nearly 6,000 miles away and begin angling for a transfer but before you can get it you are dropped in a situation unlike any you've ever been in. What do you do?<br /><br />  Matt Weston (played by Ryan Reynolds) is the guardian of a CIA safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. While he is required to conceal the true nature of his workplace and his employer, once he's entered the office, turned on the lights and locked the door behind him, he's done just about everything he needs to do that day. Meanwhile, the Agency's most wanted fugitive, CIA agent turned traitor Tobin Frost (played by Denzel Washington) has been arrested in a nearby embassy while trying to escape the men who'd already murdered his business contact. Senior management at the Agency is stunned and determined to find out what Frost (Washington) was running from in addition to ascertaining the true extent of the damage he's already done since going rogue more than ten years earlier. However, before Frost cooperates, hostile forces break through the facility's defenses and assassinate Frost's armed escorts. Soon Weston (Reynolds) is on the run with Frost in tow all while trying to keep them both alive and deliver Frost to the intended destination.<br /><br />  If you've seen Enemy of the State, Man on Fire, Unstoppable, or Spy Game, you'll no doubt recognize the directing style of Tony Scott in this latest film starring Denzel Washington. The problem being that the director of this film is a man by the name of Daniel Espinosa and while I am a fan of Scott and his films, it shows a considerable lack of imagination on Espinosa's part to direct his films in a near-identical manner. Putting that aside, Washington is exceptional as he often is, Reynolds is surprisingly good and spares us the sarcasm we've come to love and expect from him, and supporting players Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Sheppard make the sub-plot almost as interesting as the main story. I enjoyed it a lot.Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Sheppard make the sub-plot almost as interesting as the main story. I enjoyed it a lot.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged that a disappointing book by a beloved author is more depressing than a genuinely bad book by an unknown author.  Death Comes to Pemberley is such a disappointing book. Surprisingly disappointing given my love for P. D. James, especially her Adam Dalgliesh series, and my enjoyment of Jane Austen's books. Jane's suffered more than her share of exploitation of late between mash-ups, story extensions and a series depicting her as busy-body-mystery-solver, and while this latest re-purposing of her characters doesn't involve anything as nutty as sea monsters it is nonetheless a mystifying endeavor.<br /><br />I truly cannot understand why P. D. James felt the need to write this book but my bafflement there is miniscule compared to my total incomprehension of why she felt the need to publish it. I can't understand why, having committed to writing a book based on Pride and Prejudice she felt the need to retell the entire plot of that book in the first 10 pages of this one. Nor can I come up with a reasonable answer as to why an author with a finely honed style like James would want to play ventriloquist with another well-known style, only do to a so-so job at it anyway.<br /><br />What really left me staggered in this book is how dull, nay, boring it is. I don't mean slow-moving, I mean actively, aggressively dull. The book focuses on proud, shy and aloof Darcy, which cuts down on the conversational opportunities. The sisters Bennet are barely present and only two of them having anything approaching a conversation. Which made no sense - a murder happens at your sister's house and you don't want to chat it over? The murder isn't interesting and all the opportunities it gives Darcy to plumb the depths of his soul just proves that Darcy isn't all that deep. The absolute nadir, however, involves one character explaining the events of the murder while allowing that another person will probably want to tell their own version. And they do. Except it's pretty much the same version. Just told twice.<br /><br />To sum up, while this book does not feature zombies, it might as well have been written by zombie. Avoid this one.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|Could you stand to have the entire course of your life defined by one horrific act? If so, imagine said act being committed by someone else. In fact, not just someone else, but your own son.<br /><br />  The film opens on a dream sequence that I struggle to see the relevance of even now and, when it ends, we are introduced to a waking Eva Katchadourian (played by Tilda Swinton). Eva is living in a run-down house that has recently been vandalized along with her car. Rather than report it, Eva (Swinton) merely cleans the windshield and departs on a search for employment. She was once a successful travel writer but has experienced great difficulty finding work since her son Kevin (played by Ezra Miller) took it upon himself to carry out a massacre in his high school. Kevin was a difficult child from infancy, crying incessantly at all hours while Eva's husband Franklin (played by John C. Reilly) is out of the house working. As Kevin grows older, the difficulties only increase. He doesn't speak or appear to understand when others do as a toddler. When he finally does speak, he refuses to be toilet trained. This frustrates Eva till she throws Kevin against a wall, breaking his arm. It wasn't clear, at least to me, whether it was intentional or not, but Kevin claims he fell and returns home willing and able to use the toilet. Franklin (Reilly) is amazed and delighted while Eva is consumed by guilt. When their second child is born, things only get worse.<br /><br />  Swinton's character is far from perfect, but on some level, the audience sympathizes with her. Both as a mother whose son is clearly more disturbed than her husband is capable of realizing and as the widow being harassed on a nearly constant basis for a crime she didn't commit. Reilly's character is infuriating, but only viewing the problem from Eva's eyes makes it a lot easier to see than it would be for someone spending most of the day outside the home. Prior to watching this film, my only knowledge of Miller's acting was when he guest-starred as the precocious son of a wealthy, absentee father with substance abuse issues on the USA Network show Royal Pains. That character was highly likeable in addition to being entertaining and the total opposite of Kevin which he plays perfectly.'s acting was when he guest-starred as the precocious son of a wealthy, absentee father with substance abuse issues on the USA Network show Royal Pains.

B007AMMHSY|3.0|Antonio Banderas fans will love this movie. It is subtitled but still easy to follow along and most of the action, and movie sequences can be gathered without even focusing heavily on the sub-script. With that being said this movie was \\"HIT\\" and \\"MISS\\" for me. One moment you are saying \\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT\\" and the next you have to scratch your head as to where exactly was this movie driving to.<br /><br />Is it worth the rent?<br /><br />Yes, if you are not having to fork out more than say 4 bucks for it. There are interesting concepts subtly woven within the fabric of the movie. Such as love, and the loss of a loved one, and to what extremes one will go to, to re-capture what is lost.<br /><br />This movie definitely has a part where you are saying to yourself \\"NO WAY, HE DID NOT JUST DO THAT\\"? Yet, once you get past the initial thrill of that film sequence, the viewer is sorta left in limbo as to how it should tidy up it's loose ends, and bring the film to a nice tidy conclusion. On shock value alone this film is worth the rent, but the conclusion at the end of the film will leave many viewers scratching their head asking \\"is that it\\"?<br /><br />As for me, I would recommend it for your enjoyment, just do not expect it to knock your socks off. At best it will leave you a lasting impression into what can be done, and is done in the world of plastic surgery and the quest for love on a slightly obsessed and creepy level.<br /><br />-nuff said

B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Before I downloaded this I read the reviews claiming no widgets. This app doesn't install directly to your phone, so you have to move it and then the widgets will appear. Its not bad looking but that's not really a factor that seals the deal. I would like to have it find my location without typing it in all the time. My stock weather app does an excellent job of doing that. It seems a bit inaccurate, because its suppose to rain and have thunderstorms which I'm not seeing anytime soon. Looking outside confirmed my suspicion. With that I give three stars and the widgets ARE there. Manage your apps!

145162445X|3.0|When Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss, the writer of A Universe From Nothing, speaks of intelligence in the universe, we find him, on the one hand, asserting that no evidence exists in support of intelligence on a divine level, and, on the other, undertaking to promote his personal views and perceived intellect as if they were, somehow, divine in their own right. In college, we would have called him an old fudge (meaning a frustrated head-of-department Ph.D. who's been stuck too long to an academic chair).<br /><br />As to his current book, the author needs to step back from his limited perception of reality, take a good, healthy dose of Elixir Of Metaphysics, and try again. Granted, this book is filled with fascinating facts and ideas, but it lacks the perspective of someone who understands what human existence is all about and knows how to dream a bit. (One can only wonder at the level of enlightenment possessed by an author who boldly asserts that \\"A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality....\\" [! See p.139 of his text]. Alas, how out of balance his life must be, and how unfortunate it must have been to have experienced childhood without Peter Pan and Santa Claus.) Some of us on this planet have come to recognize that life is not all computer screens and equations, it is an ongoing experience of consciousness. And in that context, a truly open mind means an unfettered imagination, which is the direct antithesis of forcing ourselves to conform to reality! The author tacitly, indeed almost smugly, admits he is not a Christian. Thank God! If he were, he would likely be one of the overly fundamentalist types he complains about. Don't bother him with the evidence, his mind is made up. Perhaps HE doesn't see it that way, but Dr. Krauss already has a religion, and its name is Science. (Let us therefore bow and scrape as we leave our imaginations at the door.)<br /><br />Krauss tells us (p.147) that in order for him to accept that something is alive, it must be able to capture energy from its environment and self-replicate. That's a good definition, but what happens if we take it one step further--expand upon it, as it were, and dare to dream a bit? Suppose the so-called energy of empty space, as represented by Einstein's famed cosmological constant, is actually energy being captured by our universe from its environment in order to self-replicate? If that turns out to be so (see Krauss, p.150, where he talks about energy being dumped into empty space as it expands), then it suggests our universe is a living thing, an entity unto itself. And if our universe is alive, and able to self-replicate, which is to say, re-create itself, then is it so unreasonable to consider that our Universe and the living force we call God are one and the same? Because if so, that means we ourselves are actually a tiny part of God--God's children, as it were. No doubt Krauss would see such thinking as the product of an unfettered imagination not rooted in empirical reality. However, while he may be correct in saying that the universe doesn't need God, the idea that the universe might actually be God doesn't seem to have occurred to him... at least, not yet.<br /><br />Which leads us to one final question which is perhaps the most important of all: How can anyone write an entire book about A Universe From Nothing without even once mentioning Gautama Buddha and the fascinating, and truly metaphysical, mental gymnastics focused around the Buddhist, and especially the Zen Buddhist, concept of a universal consciousness that ultimately derives from nothingness? Perhaps that says it all, because without the conscious awareness necessary to perceive it, the universe amounts to... you guessed it, nothing. But then, that's really what it's all about, isn't it?

0439023521|4.0|I've been hearing about how I need to read the Hunger Games trilogy from friends for several years now. I thought since the series is geared towards teen readers that I wouldn't find the books interesting or relatable. I was wrong! The Hunger Games is a fascinating book that includes suspense, action and romance. The main character, Katniss, is a normal teenager who hunts to keep her family properly nourished. Once a year all the children from the ages of 12-18 from her society of Panem are rounded up for 'the Reaping' and 24 children's names are picked from a lottery to enter the Hunger Games, a test of survival which leaves only one victor. The non-victorious participants have to be killed off as a reminder to all that the Capitol (Panem's government) has control over all citizens. The games take several weeks and are watched by the entire population of Panem much like a reality tv show. After the reaping occurs is where Katniss's story truly unfolds and it's riveting until the last page. I've already started reading the second book in the series because I became so invested with the characters and I also look forward to seeing how the tale is  brought to life when the movie comes out in theaters this month.
B00386OWUC|3.0|The title references the ribbon tied around the arm of misbehaving children in a reminder of innocence, purity and other biblical teachings, especially of Lutheran Protestants of 1913 Germany.  Critics fawned all over this foreign language Oscar contender and with some reservation I understand why.  The film is shot in beautiful black and white which certainly highlights the foreboding darkness that prevails over the village and its inhabitants.  Mysterious assaults occur over time and the town leaders can't figure it out.  Early on there is a strong hint that the children are somehow involved.<br /><br />Much has been made by critics of how the movie portends Fascism, but I'm not so sure.  The strong, unrelenting dominance of the family patriarchs can be seen in English, Irish and yes American cultures as well.  I think it is more the religious teachings of the time.  In any case, I can't get too gushy about the film.  While the stark photography is indeed beautiful, I found the film unsatisfying in the end.  Do we always need to tie up stories all neat and orderly?  Surely not, but some questions need to be answered.  The movie, while expertly directed, moves along at a glacial pace and I understand the director shaved an hour off just to get it to 2 1/2 hours.<br /><br />The Blu ray is 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Both are exemplary.

Only a few widget display options, and the weathet info shown when clicked on is the same as the widgets (or should be).  It should show more info, like access to weather radar, or previous highs and lows, etc.  I have looked at many weather widgets and this one is just to simple.  Not to mention the info displayed can be wrong, it should not show sunny and cloudy for the same day on different displays.

B006SMLAMQ|4.0|After first installing this app I was disappointed to find that they didn't include any widgets. But then I really thought about the way I use weather apps and how much sense this makes. I check the weather when planning for weekends and before I leave home so wasting resources (ram/screen space) on a widget that I only really look at a couple times a day is stupid. I can open the app from the shortcut and without fiddling around with swiping through extra screens and menus I get all the info I want. I can choose exactly what I want to see and the whole experience, including setup, is very intuitive.<br /><br />I have removed a star as the app lacks support for National Weather Service alerts for severe weather. If widgets are what you want (outside the app) then look elsewhere.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The stand part of it can be a little flippy sometimes, and can get away from you if you don't secure it properly.  Even then it can snap apart.  But overall, for the price, I really like this cover.  I didn't want anything obtrusive, that got in the way.  This is quite nice and keeps my screen nice and clean.  I feel better about throwing it in a drawer, or on the desk, it is at least a little protected.
B006ZEDZNY|1.0|I don't know by what process he picks his movies but Mr. Depp may have well lost a bet to have been in this one.  His movie 'Deadman' is the only movie I've seen of his that, in my opinion, ranks below this one.  This piece of drivel is rotten from start to finish.  The combination of no likeable characters and non-nonsensical action scenes spliced together haphazardly and mixed with scenes that were better suited for the cutting room floor make this movie the sort that only stoners, drunks, and masochists could enjoy for any extended amount of time. And I'm being nice.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The plot has been described to death below, so I won't add to it. However, here are a few problems/questions I had concerning the book (which I found extremely exciting because I read almost all of it in one sitting, something I rarely do because I'm so slow):<br /><br />--A map would have been nice. The only two physical locations we have are District 12's Appalachian setting and, probably, Denver as the Capital (\\"in the Rockies\\"). What part of the country was doomed District 13 in? Probably California, but who knows? Maybe the author had not worked this out in Volume I--but she should have.<br /><br />--The author must have been a food critic in another life. The book is FULL of descriptions of food and feasts and survival meals. I grew a bit tired of it, but maybe nearly-starving people fantasize about food, which might explain the obsession.<br /><br />--The heroine acts like she's 11 years old at times (throws hissy-fits and full-blown tantrums), 16 at other times (slightly coquettish, slightly bitchy, but not totally self-absorbed, which is pleasantly unusual for this age), and 35 during battle, demonstrating maturity and advanced survival skills in a fight to the death with much stronger opponents.<br /><br />--What was with the delivery system for the \\"gifts\\" from sponsors (food, weapons, medicines, etc.)? Things float from the sky suspended by little parachutes and arrive at your feet--in the forest? Come on!<br /><br />--I realize this book was written with teens as the audience (just as most movies are today), but by age 16 a girl has SOME idea about sex and sexuality--and some girls know just about all there is to know. The book completely ignores this aspect of the heroine's being, however. The same can be said for the guys, who in real life are total hornballs at this age, and sex would be almost as strong a motivator as survival with them.<br /><br />Lest this nit-picky list (which could be much longer) sound too negative, let me repeat that I loved the book and would recommend it to anybody but a literary critic or a serious sci-fi fan. The author has a good eye for natural phenomena and often describes it beautifully. It's certainly worth the money ... and I plan to purchase the next two installments of the tale.
B000001E7T|5.0|I was just reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews and I'm floored. This has got to be one of PJ Harvey's best, and most accessible, albums but people are lamenting how it's unlistenable and how they would rather use the CD as a coaster. I heared once that the average album is listened to 1.5 times, which is probably true, but very sad. Do people really want instant gratification when it comes to music? If that's what you want, then listen to the radio where you'll get the same old drivel offending your ear drums on tight rotation all day long.<br /><br />To Bring You My Love is a fantastic album. And even today in 2012, 17 years after its release, it still sounds fresh and vibrant. May PJ Harvey bring us her love for many years to come.<br /><br />Recommend. Buy it. Listen to it. Quit complaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is the first of three books who follow the heroine Katniss Everdeen through life in a post apocalyptic world where the 1% in power use the 99% as slaves and pawns in a fight to the death game.

1577314808|3.0|The first thing I want to say is that this book is mostly full of good observations and insight.  Otherwise, how could it have gotten so many good reviews?<br /><br />Then again, sometimes people are wrong.  Nazi Germany was wrong, slavery was wrong, George Bush and Dick Cheney were wrong and what is currenlty happening to women in the US is wrong.<br /><br />But Eckhart Tolle tells us \\"never to judge,\\" so disregard the previous paragraph.<br /><br />That said, the author is obviously an expert on heterosexual relationships, having, no doubt, been there, done that.  And his insight into anger and resentment is chilling, chilling in the sense that he seems to know more about these two emotions than I do.<br /><br />But I, for one, would like to know more about his life, his three years spent homeless, jobless and living on park benches.  Can he not devote more than a few lines to such a past, in a book of almost 200 pages?<br /><br />Perhaps not, as the whole point of the book is Now.  Living in the moment, forgetting about the past, and not thinking about the future.<br /><br />The question he fails to answer is what will be the effect on modern society when we all stop worrying about the future?  Will it suddenly devolve?  Or will we enter an age of enlightenment?<br /><br />That understood, there is something to be learned here.  I just wonder what sort of a house Mr. Tolle lives in, and what sort of a car does he drive, since he rails so heavily against the industrial complex?  Or does he live in a treehouse and ride a bicycle, like many of those who live in Vancouver do?<br /><br />I am giving him three stars, not because I think he's a scam artist posing as a sincere person wishing to make the world a better place, but becuase after reading this book, I've thought about it alot.  And judging from the response, so have you.<br /><br />However, I think Mr. Tolle overstepped his bounds when he described what it is like when we die.  How does he know?  Has he died and risen from the dead?<br /><br />Three stars.  Rick says check it out.and risen from the dead?<br /><br />Three stars.  Rick says check it out.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is so easy to pass this book off as cliché and unrealistic, but I really think that this was one of the major points in this book.  At least that is what my perception was (it seemed to highlight it several points throughout the book). Life is hard and we continuously convince ourselves that our situations are unique, but that is far from the truth. People in our lives die, we live portions of our lives in excess, we remain ignorant to things that are staring us right in the face, and we choose to be ignorant of things that are currently too hard to deal with at the time. What is unique is how we choose to deal with those situations.  The negative reviews seem to focus on this just being too absurd to happen, fine - but read this book and don't see yourself in at least one of these characters. It is unlikely you will. If for anything, it is a great satire for the things we believe we should be to the things that we actually are. If you are in high school read this book, hold on to it and then read it again in 10-15 years. If you are out of high school, read it remembering who you were in high school. As Bill would say, don't get caught up in the language, just look at the character for who they are, and go in as a filter rather than a sponge. It's a book worth the read.

B004SIP6A4|3.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I ordered the 2011 Blu-Ray Release from Amazon for $7.99, and received the 2007 Release.  I am disappointed in Amazon for doing this.  I don't know if the 2011 Release is better.  I am going to review the 2007 Release.<br /><br />The 1.85:1 video presentation was actually pretty good.  There were some dark scenes that had grain, but the majority of the movie looked very good.<br /><br />Sound was only Dolby Digital 5.1, which was pretty good.  I don't know if the 2011 Release has DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.<br /><br />The movie was about 50% drama, and 50% dance/musical performances.  If you don't like broadway shows, you probably shouldn't purchase this movie.  It is about an hour and 50 minutes long.
B007JUWM64|1.0|Being perfectly honest, I feel like I was robbed of my time and money. Please don't waste yours. This movie was really horrible.
0691152640|2.0|First off, let me say what I love about this book. That it is full of data, graphs, and that it takes a long view of history. It includes lots of data sources -- one-third of the book is comprised of appendices, which I see as a plus. Another large segment of the book simply describes the data set, and describes how the data was catalogued and categorized.<br /><br />Secondly, I can confirm that this is a fairly dry text. A beach read, this is not. Should probably look to get a double-espresso before even cracking the thing open.<br /><br />Given the first two comments above, I think this book is of the most use to Economic Historians doing research in the field, who want to have a quick reference for data sources from various periods, or looking for various episodes to study. This is not a gripping account of the Great Depression, the LTCM collapse, the Asian Financial Crisis, and the Great Recession all rolled into one.<br /><br />This book also does not provide useful analysis for policy purposes. Perhaps because of the broad focus -- eight centuries -- the book does a poor job discussing the major financial crisis of the past 100 years. Namely, the book does an exceedingly poor job with the Great Depression, the Asian Financial Crisis, Japan, and the Great Recession. While I liked the book overall, perhaps because the publishers were on the authors to write quickly, the book is filled to the brim with howlers -- it says the US stock market only declined 55% during the Great Depression (which must be wrong, since the DJIA fell closer to 90%) -- but elsewhere in the book it says the average stock market decline in the entire world was also 55%, which I would expect to be lower than the decline from the US (suspicious both are the same). This raises another point about the usefulness of one of the central exercises of the book, which is to report the average impact of financial crises on GDP, unemployment, and stock and real estate markets, and other economic variables, since the choice of which countries and crises to include in those averages is somewhat arbitrary. Reporting averages can be interesting, but can also be meaningless or even misleading. The authors did not do an effective job discriminating.<br /><br />Another quibble: the authors assert that the decline in trade during the Great Depression came in part because countries left the gold standard and devalued. This could not be any more wrong. In fact, once countries devalued they began to recover, and trade increased. The trade decline they document happened up until the devaluation; it was not caused by it. When they cover public debt during the Great Depression, they respond that the reason that public debt didn't respond more was that the government response was slow. In fact, in the US case at least, the reason public debt didn't grow more quickly was not because the government didn't respond quickly enough, but rather because Hoover believed that the government needed to balance the budget and stay on the gold standard, and so raised taxes and cut spending rather quickly. The authors write that today, governments responded more quickly, but then follow that with the worst sentence in the entire book by questioning government's stimulus (fiscal and monetary) by writing that we \\"we would be wise not to push too far the conceit that we are smarter than our predecessors\\".<br /><br />And, the insights that the book does get right are minor and of secondary importance. One of their central findings, found in the last chapter on policy responses, is that \\"Having a complete picture of government indebtedness is critical\\". Thank you for the trenchant insight, Mr. Obvious. At the same time, the authors make it sound as though there is nothing, not even sound regulation, that countries can do to prevent financial or banking crises. They just happen. And once they happen, they are deep and last awhile. Not much anybody can do. Thanks, in part, to the lack of policy insight in this book, I suspect next time won't be different either.
B004SI8VQU|4.0|At first, this seemed like a pretty typical espionage thriller and nothing too special or exciting.  But as the story progressed, the more I got involved in it and enjoyed it.  The space race element was intriguing, but it was the characters that really got me hooked.  Through their history and relationships, which unfold to the reader as the amnesiac main character rediscovers them, Follett dramatizes how communism ultimately means the sacrifice of all one's own personal values, everything and everyone he holds most dear.  This makes for high drama, conflict that is meaningful both intellectually and emotionally as these elements are united in the story.  Quite well done.

B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Stupid me, there are widgets. Having a HP Touchpad, I don't mind the app's size. First impression after starting the app: Looks nice! Went to settings, changed the layout to my liking and enjoyed the result.<br /><br />Then I wanted to put it on my homescreen... First, I couldn't find any widgets, and but then I noticed that the app was automatically moved to my 'sdcard volume'. Moved it back to the tablet and had three new widgets.

B0031Y9DCS|5.0|This is an exciting book based on facts that happened during a very controversial period of American history. Mr. Mason, the author, presents a very factual account of the actions of a helicopter pilot during the Vietnam war. Once you start to read you will not be able to put this book down. You get an eyewittness view of the misery and sacrafices that our young men went thru back in those days when fighting for the \\"American way\\" was not so popular. If you, like me, were of military age back in the late 60's this should be a must read. My gratitude will always be there for those who gave so much, thank you Mr. Mason.<br />Rick Childers

0060853972|5.0|As mentioned, this is for the audio version of 'Good Omens.' I've never read a Neil Gaiman book in print; 'Anansi Boys' was the first I listened to & thought it was absolutely terrific, both book & the reading by Lenny Henry. Then I got \\"Good Omens\\" & found it to be orders of magnitude better, which I wouldn't have thought possible. I'll not bother with plot summary, as there's a plentiful sufficiency of those.<br /><br />Martin Jarvis, whose voice is soooo classy & upper-crust, does an incredible job of putting the perfect voice to each character & situation, including the many utterly absurd & laugh-out-loud parts of the book. As a lifelong print bibliophile, this is one of the very rare audiobooks that I cannot imagine being better if I had read it in print-- or of there being a narrator who could've done a better job of reading it.<br /><br />I even use the book for therapeutic purposes; I suffer from horrendous migraines, & I can lay in the dark & listen to this book (at low volume). It remains good enough after multiple listenings to distract me from the agony...& anything that can make me even smile during a migraine has to be awesomely good, in the good old fashioned sense of so good it \\"inspires a feeling of reverence or admiration, produced by that which is grand, sublime, extremely powerful, or the like.\\" [in this case grandly, sublimely, extremely witty, clever, funny, wonderfully done].<br /><br />btw, I read in reviews of the print book several comments about it being \\"British\\" humor. I just thought it was flat out first-order humor, period, but I got hooked on Monty Python as a freshman in high school, so perhaps I'm not the best American judge of what \\"British\\" humor is. The authors provide several helpful footnotes for \\"Americans & other aliens,\\" explaining what such things as 'firelighters' & 'Milton Keynes' are. Despite my fondness for things from across the pond I was not familiar with either, but the footnotes were sufficient to fill me in --& were hilarious to boot-- although one does have to extrapolate a teeny bit from context about MK...but it was just as funny from the context as it was after I Googled it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. My only caution might be that listening to it while driving could be dangerous, as it's difficult to focus on the road when you're laughing so hard tears are squirting from your eyes....not to mention the danger of a damp seat.ere hilarious to boot-- although one does have to extrapolate a teeny bit from context about MK...but it was just as funny from the context as it was after I Googled it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

B006SMLAMQ|2.0|This is a very pretty app, I will give them that.  It has lots of lovely animations for each different type of weather.  But the app has so many flaws and there are other weather apps available that are much better.<br /><br />The app cannot find your location automatically, you have to type it in manually.  This could be rather annoying if you travel a lot.<br /><br />It can't display the current conditions, only a forecast?  That's a pretty huge omission as well.<br /><br />While the description talks about widgets, there are no actual home screen widgets to be found.<br /><br />46.6 Megabyte download?  That's a lot of space for something that doesn't do that much.<br /><br />The app doesn't indicate the source of their forecast data, but I find it rather dubious.  Every other source I've checked (Accuweather, the Weather Channel, Intellicast, Foreca, Weather Underground, and the NWS) shows the weather for today will be stormy, but this app is forecasting partly cloudy?<br /><br />I'd recommend a former FAotD, Elecont's excellent, if unfortunately named, [[ASIN:B0058EBNAO Weather, USA Radar, Alerts, Quake, Barometer]] over this app.

Awful movie.
0307931803|4.0|We love the Fox in Socks book, it is a wonderful rhyme and just flows so well.  This book is abridged, like all the tiny hardcover ones, but maybe because we were so used to the original full length book, this one just didn't flow for us with all of its deletions.  Needless to say, it still has fun rhymes on the pages and the kids do like to read it.  It just isn't quite the original.

Ok ... harmless ... I wanted to see what the buzz was about, so I bought the book and continued reading and about 20% in it became totally gross and unreadable.  I kept thinking this has to get better ... but at 50% I walked away completely grossed out and prepared for nightmares.  Basically the billionaire rapes the virgin college student, has a room of sexual bondage and torture, and then asks her to sign a contract to be his submissive ... who reads this stuff???  I deleted the unfinished book from my kindle archive ... in fear that my young daughters could download this book in error.

1409115380|4.0|I am not a big fan of courtroom dramas, I have vicarious experience of the world of lawyering and it never matches the hype that you see on television or read in books.<br /><br />Thankfully and skilfully, Landay keeps the courtroom scenes to a minimum, using deftly placed cut scenes to heighten the drama and to provide a balance to the first person narrative of the book's protagonist Andy Barber, Jacobs father.<br /><br />The Tale<br />--------------<br />Jacob Barber is on trial for the murder of Ben Rifkin a classmate and bully.  Andy Barber, his father is or was the Assistant DA and his involvement early in the case complicates matters somewhat. Combine this with a young prosecutor eager to have a career launching case and community that treats the Barber's as outcasts and you have a drama that is impacting the protagonist at every turn.<br /><br />Did Jacob do it?<br />-------------------<br />Did Jacob do it?  It's the question that the reader is confronted with before even opening the book.  Landay draws us into Andy Barber's life, his family and his dark past.  As the mystery of who killed Ben Rifkin unfolds we watch his family implode.<br /><br />The first person narrative is perfect for this story.  Landay draws the reader in close, an invisible observer on Andy Barber's shoulder and by the end of the book, emotionally if not rationally you are as reluctant to see Jacob as the murderer as is his father.<br /><br />Never a dull moment<br />-----------------------<br />Though lacking the pacing of a thriller novel, there's never a lull in tension. The reader, as with all mysteries, is constantly trying to piece any clues together and Landay never quite hands you the full answer.  Much as in reality, the truth can be hard to determine.<br /><br />In summary, it's a fine, suspenseful drama that will drag you into its confidence, a book that you will have to finish.  The end holds a twist, but for some reason I didn't find it as emotionally gripping as others have.  Nonetheless it will leave you pondering, weighing probabilities and questioning your judgement.<br /><br />This book was provided to me at  no cost by the publisher.ave.

B0043UGKAM|5.0|I found the over-the-top CGI effects (blood, gore, etc) rather off-putting.  As I recall, it was almost enough that I stopped watching after just this one episode.  Luckily for me, I continued with the series.  Episode 2 is a bit slow as well... but episode 3 and beyond (including the pre-quel Gods of the Arena and the sequel Vengeance) are right up there amongst the best TV series I've ever watched.  The supporting cast shines, especially Lucy Lawless as Lucretia and John Hannah as Batiatus.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|gREAT MOVIE SINCE Constantine and Ghost Rider I can't wait to own this one. Some people didn't like it because this Guy fight a  bad guy
1400052181|5.0|This book has \\"blown me away\\", so to speak. I read it primarily because my granddaughter, a junior in high school, had to read it as required reading. My grandson in college read it because my granddaughter read it. That being said, what an astounding book!<br /><br />Who knew that one black woman could have this much impact on so many people in the entire world and, also, that her family would not know about it, or be rewarded for it.<br /><br />If every science text book was written this well, every student in school would love their reading assignments. They would be filled with discussion questions for their teachers the next time their classes met.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot spent ten years researching for this book and thousands of hours interviewing the people involved. Her facts are extensive. Her writing is true to the vocabulary and vernacular of the person she's quoting. She's very precise in presenting all the people on paper the way they are or were in life.<br /><br />This is an amazing story and Rebecca Skloot has done an amazing job in telling it. This is one book that should not be missed
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I think that this is an nice and very pretty app. And I love the background I think that it is beautiful. And my name is Dahlia Huff I am 11 years of age and ivlove to sing an dance.

B006JPS1OM|4.0|Downloaded the free version.  im sure that soon i wil run out of time on it, but i am enjoying it so far.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|It works quite well on my Kindle Fire, but it could use a volume control. Maybe i missed it? The price is right, too. Volume is Kindle thing too though.
0812550706|5.0|Great books shift with the times. A great book understands a particular so well it illuminates the universal. \\"Ender's Game\\" is a great book. Even though it was published way back before I was born in 1985 it still feels fresh. (And even if it was written by a seemingly insane religious homophobe.) No matter. It's about today as much as it was yesterday. And, like all great sci-fi, it's about tomorrow. Somehow Card managed to build a world both familiar and alien without lapsing into the tired tropes of science fiction eternal. It's a great book. Hope it's a great movie.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Ridiculously bloated app that's not quite as useful as your average weather web page. So much wasted space. Video for weather conditions? Really? And what is this 'no-Optimus' trend with the bottom-end apps? In short, don't waste your time or phone space.
0439023513|5.0|After reading bad review after bad review I had to throw my two cents in. These reviews bring to mind that line in A Few Good Men, \\"you can't handle the truth.\\" Seriously people this was never an uplifting series, and after the first book how could you ever think this series could end well? The reality is that from the beginning children were sacrificed for entertainment and retribution so where exactly were we going to get our happy ending from? The fact is when there is a revolution lives are lost, characters that we've grown to love will die, and the atrocities of war will haunt you for a lifetime. Katniss carried on the only way she knew how, damaged. The fact that she carried on at all is somewhat of a miracle, but the fact that she went on to love and even have children is all the happy ending that I need.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application is fantastic.  I am able to look up scripture to read on a daily basis. I highly recommend this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is perfect for passing time. The games are simple yet addictive. It can be confusing at first until you figure out how to read the instructions and play each game. I haven't yet unlocked games past the first ten, but this satisfies my need to rid my brain of boredom. Certainly a nice app. I would also like to add that a lot of the low star reviews were from people who hadn't quite figured out how to work this app yet. As I said it is a bit confusing and frustrating at first, but after you figure out the layout that this app uses it smoothed out nicely.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very entertaining, it keeps you thinking and time flies when you are trying to put everything together. this is a &quot;must have &quot; game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. I use it every day!<br /> I love to bookmark it. And copy passages for notes. I share veres via email all the time.  I am able to switch versions easily. I can listen to the recorded scriptures as I read or even just listen as I cook.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I had this while waiting for my doctors appolntment and it was great having something to do instead of reading old magazines

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games completely fulfilled my expectations for what is proving to be an extremely popular book. I was forced to purchase the digital copy, since all physical copies in every airport anywhere seem to be permanently sold out. Perhaps the best way to communicate the book's excitement is simply to tell you that I finished the book cover-to-cover in about 5 hours.<br /><br />The setting of the book is The Truman Show meets Roman gladiators, with the ages of the main characters adjusted to \\"teenager\\". I was perfectly able to escape into the book's world and engross myself in the story. I highly recommend reading the Kindle preview first, once you reach the end of the preview you should be certain that you must finish the rest of the book. I don't feel the writing of Hunger Games is perfect, the writing drifts from \\"good\\" to peaks of \\"great\\", so I'm not sure that it will endure as a classic work of literature in America, but I still strongly recommend the purchase. I will be purchasing book two of the series now!<br /><br />If you enjoy this book, then you should look at the Shadow Children series by Margaret Peterson Haddix.
B003KRJNBW|1.0|I mean Denzel can't really act and it not that good looking.  I guess the ego fulfillment won't die this si a crushingly horrible movie that makes 0 sense and the ending si so hilariously awful I was like come on man is there no insult the ausdience won't take now? wow sooo bad
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|this case definitely delivers on protection along with a slim profile. the stand functionality is very basic. this is the case for you if your biggest concern is not adding any bulk to the kindle fire, but still want protection. i was worried the elastic band would be the weak point, but being rough with it has had no ill effect. this is a simple yet effective case for the kindle fire.
B0051QO4QY|2.0|This album is a bit of a surprise from the very talented Lady Gaga. It is incredibly boring and repetitive, much like the last pathetic efforts of the Black Eyed Peas before their recent break-up. Gaga's last two albums were heaping servings of meaty steak and potatoes, with memorable funky and infectious rock genius. \\"Born This Way,\\" by comparison, is like air-puff cereal, light, flaky, no substance, and boring. It sounds like the stuff teenagers dance to at a high school social when they're not really paying attention but just bouncing to a background beat. Maybe that's what this was designed to be...just white noise. It actually lulled me to sleep in the car at a stoplight while I was listening to it!<br />  Let's hope she's back in form next time.
B007M6P01O|5.0|My only regret is that the season is over and won't be back until Fall. This was especially true since we got a brief introduction to one of the best characters at the end, Michonne, who wields a sword like Darryl uses his crossbow. I loved her in the comic books.<br /><br />In this episode, the group at the farm encounters herding for the first time, which is a mass gathering of walking dead on the attack. This brings on a major battle with the inevitable loss of some characters. For those who enjoy battles, this entire sequence is really something with Rick and Carl having to set fire to the barn to kill some of the Zombies attacking them. Darryl fights on a big motorcycle with his crossbow while Andrea gets cut off from the group in the deep woods.<br /><br />They learn a valuable lesson from this attack and that is that having a haven is not enough.  They need a haven with fortifications (a medieval castle and keep with a moat would be terrific but there are none of those).<br /><br />Another thing that becomes crystal clear is that Rick is the group's natural leader, an alpha wolf type with his pack. There are so few survivors left in this new world that there will be no survival without natural leaders. Most of the other candidates for leading in this new world are borderline psychopathic killers so Rick is a rare commodity.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for Fall's opening episode!<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I loaded this on my Kindle Fire and I use it at least once every day.  I have lots of different locations loaded on it (home, work, common camping locations, kid's college town, etc.).  This is so much more useful than the reports from the bimbos on the TV news channel.  I love the alerts, the ten-day forecast, the maps, and the quick switching between locations.  I love the Android version on my Kindle so much that I searched on the Apple App Store and downloaded it to my iPhone too.  It's so much better than the Weather app that comes with the iPhone.<br /><br />Well done, weather channel!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Love all the songs on this album.  Really enjoy all of the sounds of Adele! Great buy, especially when you can download.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|This is an attractive weather app, but it's just too basic.  It just shows you some very basic information...pretty much just the five-day forecast plus some simple wind speed data.<br /><br />This app is nowhere near as useful as the [[ASIN:B0064X7FVE Weather Channel App]].  Since the Weather Channel app is a freebie too, why not use it?  It includes much more info, like a ten-day forecast, maps, alerts, hourly, etc.<br /><br />Although I like the beautiful look of this app, it just doesn't have much functionality.  I've deleted it from my system already.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I'm a huge Disney fan. I know most of the movies by heart, and this is by far one of the best. I will never understand why it was a box office flop.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is awesome... plain and simple. 101 games plus 20 has taken up so much of my free time. its cool.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|So, as a 22 year old girl, I am about 10 years older than your average One Direction fan, but this album truly is amazing. I am been following them for a while and cant believe how suddenly successful they have become here in the States. Its pretty amazing. Every single song on the album seems to be better than the last, which is rare and I find myself forgetting that I am listening to a boyband from a singing competition as opposed to seasoned performers, their just that good. The vocal ability some of these guys have is unreal and this cd really highlights that. Liam Payne, Zayne Malik and Harry Styles are the standouts and their voices really do shine through on many of the songs. Great album if you are a fan of these boys but also just a great album in general. I predit 2012 to be the biggest year a new group has ever seen.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I purchased this book after reading all the recs for it in the Romance Forum. I do have to say, I haven't read a contemporary book with a hero like Travis in a while. He was extremely possessive, to an almost stalker in real life point. But I do admit, I liked that (in fiction!). I could absolutely tell that he was very much in love with Abby and would do anyhing for her. He didn't need to go after every guy who said something negative to her though. Wish we could have read from his POV as well.<br /><br />I found Abby to be a bit annoying. She was kind of wishy washy with her feelings toward Travis, while at the same time hanging out with another guy.<br /><br />The ending was written up nicely. Would definitely read about Travis' brothers if there was a series made.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|At first glance, this is a beautiful app. I think most can agree the HD background wallpapers are gorgeous. I love the big easy to see numbers for the clock and the date, as well. The apps overall look is beautiful, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, this app pales in comparison to a few others apps that have many more features for the same price. I do believe however, that it has great potential should the developer be willing to listen to his customers & take the time needed in order to make an app that the general population would be satisfied with. With that being said, I will give an overview of what I did and did not find while testing this app on my Kindle Fire:<br /><br />On the main page of the app, if you go to the bottom right hand corner, you'll see a tear drop shape with a plus sign inside. Tap this to quickly add a new location. If you tap the arrow at the bottom center of your Kindle screen to pull up the Menu, you'll see 3 Menu options: Locations, Layout & Settings.<br /><br />Tap Locations to add or edit your cities. To edit or delete a city, tap and hold the city you want to work with. A window will appear with your options.<br /><br />Tap Layout to work with the apps 8 different Widget layouts:<br /><br />All Widgets: includes all the widgets icons along with: the clock in large numbers, the city & country, day, month, & year, temperature, current conditions (example: fog with cloud cover 75%), 5 day forecast, 3 hour interval projected daily forecast for each of the 5 days (this is kinda cool), humidity, precipitation, wind speed & direction, barometric pressure, & visibility. This is also the Default mode when you first start the app.<br />All Widgets without details: includes everything above except humidity, precipitation, wind speed & direction, pressure & visibility.<br />Clock & Daily Forecast Widget: removes the 5 day, 3 hour interval projected forecast<br />Clock & Daily Forecast Widget without Details: same as above but removes the bottom detail information bar, also.<br />Clock Widget: Clock, city, country, current conditions (with icon), day, month, year & temperature with detail bar included at the very bottom.<br />Clock Widget without Details: same as above with the detail bar at the bottom<br />Minimal Widget: A small bar at the very bottom of your screen with city, country, current condition & icon, date & temperature<br />No Widgets, Text Only: city, time & temperature all in LARGE print, as well as country, current conditions and the date in smaller print.<br />Each one of these widget variations can be used in either portrait or landscape mode.<br /><br />Tap Settings in Menu to access transparency options for the foreground & background.(one reviewer had mentioned the pictures transparency couldn't be adjusted. This is where it can be done) Set your app for  either Celsius or Fahrenheit, Distance Unit to Kilometers or Miles, & you can also check to disable the Auto Lock (this can be accessed through the Kindle Fire settings as well). You can also set the Weather Update Rate to either every hour, 3, 6, 12, or 24. There is an option to strictly use only the 24-hour Format if you wanted to but, I noticed the Time Settings for Use Device Settings was grayed out. I'm unsure as to why as this is one of the issues with the app for the 3 hour interval widget. Other than that that, I didn't see any other problems with the 24 hour format that has been mentioned in other reviews.<br /><br />Pros: If you tap on each day of the week or a 3 hour interval in the widgets, the picture will change according to that forecast. I saw one reviewer say that the animated pictures were not always accurate in conjunction with the icons so, I tested a bunch of them. I came across a partly cloudy icon. At first it started out with clouds & sun but then became completely cloudy, then changed back to partial sun & clouds again. The forecast icon was forecasting partly cloudy. In my opinion, it seemed accurate.<br />Allthe HD pictures & animation are beautiful and work flawlessly on my Fire. There was no freezing, crashing, force closing, lagging or hangups.<br /><br />Cons: Download file is extremely large due to large amount of graphics & animation.<br />If you're going to have this much bloat in an app, then it should have live Doppler radar or other types of radar maps, emergency weather warnings & updates, Hurricane trackers & the like.<br /><br />Overall, I really do like this app but, I'm going to put it in my cloud with the hope the developer will make some of the improvements I'd mentioned. =)<br /><br />3*-starsthe HD pictures & animation are beautiful and work flawlessly on my Fire.

0307888908|1.0|Given the subtitle and the source, I expected a meaty road map from the days of paper to the ways of the world's online resources. Instead, there was virtually nothing between the cover! We need steak - not just sizzle - especially from such esteemed authors. This was the first book I bought online because I happen to love bookstores.<br />Eventually, I will understand the boundaries of selling books online but perhaps someone who is used to going to the store and choosing a good read isn't the best source.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|It's pretty excited to play avg using touch screen. The game works smooth on kindle Fire. I would recommend this game for avg gamers or anyone who likes mysteries solving games. I hope there are more of this type of game in the future. Good job Fire Mapple Gemes :D

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games gives us a very interesting glimpse into another world that could one day become our own. It is a dystopian Young Adult novel written in first person. Katniss, our heroine and narrator, dreads the Reaping every year. Living in the Seam all her life, she knows what hunger is and how horrible it can be to go without food. She breaks the rules though and hunts outside of the fence with her friend Gale. Both Kantiss and Gale have more than the required entry put into the Reaping every year because they need to get the food that extra entries give them. Their families depend on them to do so.<br /><br />This is the first Reaping that Katniss' younger sister, Prim, has to take a part in. At the age of twelve you get one entry into the Reaping to be chosen for the Hunger Games. There are twelve districts on Panem that take part in these games, each has two tributes- a male and female. When you turn twelve it is the first year that you have a mandatory entry into the Reaping, but you can also opt for extra entries for grain and oil to last you for the year.<br /><br />The worst thing in the world happens though at this year's Reaping ceremony. Prim has been chosen randomly out of the thousands of entries. Katniss obviously does not want this at all, so she volunteers herself and pushes Prim out of the way. Our other tribute, Peeta, has been chosen as well. And here we start the journey into the Hunger Games itself...<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I didn't think I was going to enjoy it as much as I did. Dystopian novels are really becoming very popular, and because of that a lot of ideas are not as original. Although, don't get me wrong here, I love a good dystopian novel. Thankfully The Hunger Games was one, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I was more than sucked into this book, and did not want to put it down for one second!<br /><br />The idea of taking two children from twelve different districts and pitting them against each other to the death was disturbing, but oddly fascinating at the same time. Collins does a great job at letting us look into the life of Katniss and we really get to figure out what she's all about. She is a very honorable and strong heroine, which I appreciate. I love strong women in my books, and it just makes this read even better!<br /><br />There were many characters in this book that I fell in love with. I love Katniss for one, mostly because she's bad-ass. I also really loved Rue, she was so small and faerie like! Out of the boy tributes I really did enjoy Peeta, even though he was clueless with quite a few things.<br /><br />Collins paints a very vivid environment that the tributes have to survive in. The animals that were made by the government in this book are very imaginative but also realistic. The mockingjay for instance, I could totally see that. Take a bird that sings really well, and mutate it so that it picks up on human words and songs. There you go, you have your very own spy!<br /><br />Overall this book was very interesting, and I loved it! I can't wait to see the movie, and I also can't wait for my copy of Catching Fire to show up so I can continue the trilogy!her to the death was disturbing, but oddly fascinating at the same time.

B004BSFC46|4.0|These are beautiful rattles.  Plush, soft, high quality, definitely not the cheap stuff I have seen in stores.  I love them!  Unfortunately, my child could care less no matter how many times I've tried to get him to pay attention to these.  Hence the 4 stars.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This was great the day Matt Lauer decided to roll his salad bowl/bagel combo through the Atlantic Ocean on his way to interview me &amp; my cousin &amp; my mom &amp; my aunt, (we call them the moomallahs.) Anyways, Matty got lost &amp; we couldn't find him. We asked Al Roker, who hopped on his bagel &amp; used his Weather + app to find his dear confidante. There was Al &amp; Matt bobbing up &amp; down in the ocean, clinging to their bagels for dear life. They made it home safe &amp; sound, then we made up a song to commemorate the expedition. &quot;Matty Lauer in your salad bowl. Let it roll! Let it roll! Where's your pole?!&quot;
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I guess I should offer  disclaimer and say that I read the Twilight fanfic.  And that I read the whole trilogy over the course of a few hours, then went back and read it again in order to digest - but seriously?  That's what all of us women are making a fuss about?  Typically when fanfics are turned into novels (and it happens pretty frequently, honestly), something is CHANGED.  But Ms. James didn't change anything.  Just the names of the characters.  And she didn't do that successfully, as I couldn't figure out why \\"Rose was online\\" in book 3, until I realized that some poor editor did a shoddy job.  I'm really disappointed that these books are being considered for a movie deal, as there is no story there.  Everything develops so quickly, and takes place over the course of several weeks.  If Ana was my friend/sister/daughter and she would have shared any of this with me, I would have had her committed on a 5150 hold.  I realize that we read in order to escape real life, but these books require an entire suspension of reality.<br />Furthermore, since Ms. James decided not to change anything, the \\"Twilight\\" family dynamic stayed in place - Christian's family being adopted, how everyone ended up paired with everyone else, even evil Tanya--I mean, Elena.  I realize that the author may have been under pressure to get things out quickly, but the story suffered from lack of rewrites.  Even the physical description of the characters (really, Christian, with his copper colored hair?  And Ana with her long brown hair?).  I think these books had the chance to be something good, but because of lack of editing and vision on the author's part, they're just mediocre.  And on the bad side of mediocrity at that.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|The lead single and opening track on Bruce Springsteen's new studio album, Wrecking Ball, immediately sets the same tortured pop tone \\"Born In the U.S.A.\\" set almost three decades ago. Titled \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" and sung with an anthem-like charge, the track at first appears to be wholly patriotic, led by the repeated lyric \\"We take care of our own / Wherever this flag is flown.\\" Pay attention to the verses and the song reveals itself as Springsteen's best trickster tune in years. Clearly, this is a patriotic man - but not a man made blindly out of touch by his good fortune. \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" is a rich-get-richer call-out aimed to make members of the middle and lower classes feel comfort; a song about a struggling country led by businessmen, lawyers and, ahem, crooks with no worldview - seemingly with no regard for future generations or working classes. And so the stage is set: Bruce is back and he has a message. When he sings \\"The road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone\\" in verse one I can't help but feel that the gauntlet has been thrown - here Bruce appears to be talking directly to President Obama, adding \\"Where's the promise from sea to shining sea?\\" Bruce publicly supported the Change Campaign, yet here is a record aimed at the shortsighted bailout era of American politics.    Eleven heavy tracks deep, Wrecking plays through as an observational critique of modern American culture that I can't much argue with. Springsteen writes and sings from the perspective of a hopeful humanitarian struggling to understand how our human instincts and general intentions got so cloudy. \\"Jack of All Trades,\\" a beautiful song featuring guitar hero Tom Morello, is sung from the perspective of the working man, out hoping for a better day while working through the pain. The song questions why the fortunate care so little about the less fortunate, building to the cheesy-but-effective line \\"Now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood / We stood thedrought now we'll stand the flood.\\" What matters more, luck or resilience? History or the future? Wrecking Ball is clear in voice and sweet at heart - a sad but sanguine album that aims for the ear of both the comfortable and the crying.    The biggest issue with the disc in question as an album is that Bruce seems to be pandering below his ability for ears and attention. The music was probably really quite great in demo form and rehearsal sessions. But once the tunes hit the studio the sheen came on strong, and with it some cheese (see \\"Rocky Ground\\"). This because, we have to assume, Bruce and the boys wanted to get their message out to as many ears as possible, not unlike how they did with Born In the U.S.A. (And hey, let's face it, most listeners don't much care for gritty, authentic rock n' roll these days.) Also like Born, Wrecking Ball's lyrics seem more straight forward, more obvious, than what we've come to expect from the guy who wrote Darkness On the Edge of Town. And while I do think the message would cut deeper had Bruce written more for himself, rather than for the supposed radio masses, I've already seen a lot of people reacting strongly to the record. Not the blind chanting that Born saw, but people actually digging in on the message of the record. Quality ears. The biggest difference between the Born and Wrecking eras is that people today are influenced by television and celebrity culture, not music or written words. It doesn't matter how insightful and accessible Springsteen makes his message, people just aren't going to hear it. Not enough people, that is - not unless Bruce grows breasts or wears a meat dress. Regardless, the songs are above average and the message is one I can easily commend for its positive intentions. If nothing else, here Bruce epitomizes the guts and focus of a born leader.    As an overall work, Wrecking Ball doesn't offer solutions as much as it does commentary, documentation and insights. It's the kind of hopeful, politically-focused record that can cause debate and actual anger. Springsteen's thesis, I believe, is simply that the people in power are not the kind of people who should be in power - that the majority is being led by the overly fortunate when it should be led by the fighting. Pretty obvious, right? History tells us that the people who run this country - no matter their political party - have long tended to be greedy and power hungry types who've led - or desire - lifestyles that come nowhere near resembling the population they represent. But here Springsteen implies that the current breed of greed is as nasty and oppressive as ever before, and so the times are getting darker than most of us yet realize. And, thankfully, he sends his hopeful message through often great rock n' roll tracks that a generous number of ears will hear. By now Bruce Springsteen is as rich as any citizen would ever need to be; that he still has the ability to feel the pain of the lower classes so deeply is what makes him a good man. That he spends his days and energy using his art to speak for the underrepresented is what makes him Bruce Springsteen, the most ethical, soulful American songwriter since Woody Guthrie.    Post Script: Bruce, you're a good man with great intentions and incredible leadership abilities. As much as I think a lot of us love the intentions of Wrecking Ball, I'd much rather you get back to the gritty storytelling and modest production - where the soul, not the message, serves the song. Here we have a good record that's handicapped only by the grand, honorable - and ultimately limiting - intentions of its maker. The problem is that Bruce Springsteen is one of the few living masters capable of making great rock n' roll records, and that's what I want him to do most - go out racing in the street.

B000660UN0|5.0|I saw part of this program on cable and immediately started my DVR.  It was so good I wanted to try and find it online. Low and behold I found it on Amazon at a great price.  This was a fantastic CD/DVD combo!.  I would have paid double just for the DVD.  If you like good blues music or just love to hear vintage Clapton  DO NOT PASS THIS DEAL UP!!!!!!  I swear Clapton gets better with age.  TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I just watched this presentation on TV and decided I had to own this DVD. I will watch it many times in the future.All the actors perform brilliantly but Ramin Karimloo is outstanding,orchestra sounds great and costumes are breathtaking. I also enjoyed the bonus which includes Andrew Lloyd Webber presentation -very emotional- and the appearance on stage of the surviving Original London Cast including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford who does not sings, but we do get two numbers with Sarah and four previous phantoms. The Phantoms are excellent, but Sarah's voice lacks the beauty it had long time ago, what does not take out any merit from her, just watch her acting a 25 year ago .Whether you are or not a fan of the Phantom don't miss this DVD you will love it as many do.

I'm using two Sandisk 32gb Class 4 cards, formatted from within the psp and have had no trouble so far. Everything runs smooth and the only trouble I have is thinking of the list of retro heaven I'm going to put on there :)<br /><br />UPDATE : 1/2/14<br /><br />Got a giftcard from Best Buy and so used it to buy 2x 64gb micro sd cards - lo and behold! they work in this adapter! Formatted in the psp, and I now have 118gb of storage! Sweet! :D

B005URRCUY|5.0|El Camino, which was recorded and released a mere months it seems after The Black Keys' Brothers album, is a taut, focused, and original effort from the first track to the last.  The band continue to borrow from their influences--T-Rex to Junior Kimbrough to CCR--but do so in a subtle and refreshing way.  This band is anything but derivative.<br /><br />Some standout tracks include \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\", \\"Sister\\", and \\"Stop Stop\\", all of which are irresistibly catchy and memorable.  The rest of the album is just as good.  Strongly recommended.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed the series but I have to confess that some of the descriptions sometimes were too long, and I skipped over them. At times the prose is a little heavy too, almost as heavy as the sound of the boots clunking up the spiral stairway. The idea, though, is compelling. I did want to ask the author why the inhabitants of the silos never considered building an elevator. It's also funny to read about a computer monitor and a mouse when most of us are moving to the next level of IPads and smartphones.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm sorry but if you had a problem with the ending you were reading the wrong series...maybe you should try the Twilight series...it has a fairy tale ending. I loved it, right up until the last word. I was very pleased with the ending, its more than I actually expected...I wasn't sure there would be any happiness in the end...but in the end its an inspiring message to me that no matter what trials you go through in life you can survive. Maybe it's not picture perfect but the writer was trying to embrace some reality....the whole series was dark, damaged and violent...that's why I loved it. This was NOT written as a CHILDREN'S SERIES. So no you won't get a fairy tale \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" but this isn't Harry Potter, Twilight or any other tween series....get over it and enjoy it for the beauty and significance that it is. The whole series is a tale about the dangers of forgetting to be humane to those around you, to fight for your beliefs, and above all survive through everything. Beautiful, Perfect, Inspiring.
B0076D20E8|4.0|I admit that I watched this movie after hearing a lecture on who may have been the true author of the plays claimed by Shakespeare.  I was intrigued by the subject, which brought me to the movie, but I went in expecting a work of fiction, not a documentary.  I was very pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />The movie has enough plot twists to keep you entertained without totally losing you if you know nothing about the era prior to watching the film. I won't say that it is movie of the year, but it was good show. I am pleased with my selection for a Sunday evening movie.
B005QYKE2Y|3.0|I realize that the \\"Transformer\\" movies are generally regarded as the non plus ultra of soulless commercial moviemaking and that their popularity is supposed to presage the very demise of Cinema itself as an art form.  But such an assessment fails to take into account the movies' sense of high-spirited fun, their playful wit and their over-the-top but sometimes amusing caricatures, human and otherwise (I can't speak for the universally reviled second installment, which I haven't seen).<br /><br />Part 3, \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon,\\" starts with a clever premise:  that the original lunar landing was really just an elaborate, for-public-consumption-only ruse to launch a covert operation to explore a spaceship - the one carrying the initial wave of autobots - that had recently crash landed on the surface of the moon.  Now a new race of evil bots, known as Decepticons, are becoming activated, threatening to destroy the good bots and take over the earth for their own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />On the human side, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) may have saved the world in the past, but he still can't find a job.  But mere unemployment can't keep an honest-to-goodness, dyed-in-the-wool hero from saving humanity once again after the evil creatures pretty much raze Chicago in a literal scorched-earth policy of rampant death and destruction.<br /><br />The one saving grace of the \\"Transformer\\" movies - which would indeed otherwise be the epitome of soulless movie machines - has been their sense of humor, their refusal to take themselves too seriously (especially the first one).  Unfortunately, the wit and fleet-footedness of the first half of \\"Dark of the Moon\\" dribbles away in a welter of overwrought CGI effects and self-congratulatory seriousness towards the end.  And LaBeouf gets stuck playing romantic lead to any number of automatons: his metallic buddies and his flesh-and-blood girlfriend Carly Spencer - and he isn't too terribly convincing in either role.  But as an action comedy superhero, the kid definitely brings the agility and skills necessary to get the job done.  Which pretty much describes the film itself, come to think of it.t as an action comedy superhero, the kid definitely brings the agility and skills necessary to get the job done.

B00138KFYO|5.0|This is a very good collection of some of Janis' greatest hits.  There is still a great deal of music by her out there, but these are the songs that are usually known best from her.  A very nice addition to anyone's music collection, regardless of age or genre.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I don't care if I have to manually enter my preferred locations. I'm tired of apps that want to know where I am every moment of the day. I set up text alerts for severe weather for my county years ago, and I don't travel enough to worry about elsewhere. So I'm not seeing the downside. If you want widgets and pretty animations, keep it on device. If you can't or won't spare 40+ mb, push it to SD, and don't fuss about losing widgets. Not only is that an Android limitation, if your phone is old or low end enough for 40mb to be an issue, too many widgets will slow it down anyway.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The best book of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" yet. Lots of politics and interesting twists. You finish the book with the feeling that not one of the main characters is \\"safe\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've noticed with the movie coming out that the marketing for this is starting to look like twilight with the tshirts and key chains, posters...etc. Here's what my opinion is....The movies made the Twilight series....The books have made the Hunger Games series....best written story I have read to date, just finished book 3 last week...and I'm satisfied. They were a good read, couldn't put them down, very well written. They weren't written as a fairy tale, the story isn't based entirely on the romance...unlike Twilight. It's a realistic tale for a future civilization. Very twisted and dark, and I don't recommend letting your young children read them....teens at earliest.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|I bought this for the great price but there aren't any good 3d effects.Buy it on regular dvd or blu-ray don't throw away ur money spending more money in a 3D version.
0439023513|4.0|I read the Hunger Games to see if it was appropriate for my grandson.  His parents didn't want to read the book and they would not let him read the book because they weren't sure if it had too much violence in it for his age of 11.  My grandson was begging to read the book because so many of his friends had already read the book and now the movie is about to come out.  So I read the book to give his parents a review.  I thought the book was fine for him and I loved reading it so much that I have since recommended it to anyone that would listen.  As soon as I gave his parents the thumbs up my grandson read all three books by the time the weekend was over. I didn't know it was a trilogy until I finished reading the first book and gave my recommendation.  It took me a little more time to finish the other two books.  Catching Fire was just as exciting as The Hunger Games.  The disappointment came when I started reading Mockingjay.  It didn't hold up to the same level of intrigue and excitement.  I'm not disputing the general plot or the ending, I just didn't like the way the energy dwindled.  The last few chapters were confusing.  The worst part of the book that left my stomach turning and upset me greatly was the next to the last chapter that had all the children and TODDLERS.  I hated that scene.  I would never have allowed my grandson to read the series based on that one scene.  The details didn't add anything to the story.  I would have been okay with her just saying children, but she said TODDLERS and that was way too much.  If you have a tender spot for babies don't read that last book, the image will stick with you for a long time.  I wish I could erase it from my mind.
B007IQX1G4|3.0|This is a tough movie since I imagine many people watch it believing it's a straight out comedy. If you're expecting big laughs, you'll be sorely disappointed since the only comedy here is pretty dark and often cringe-worthy when it arrives. The pathetic nature of the main character and her alcoholic binges make it hard to connect with her since she's routinely narcissistic, spoiled and just plain unlikable all at the same time.<br /><br />But while it doesn't deliver on the comedy front, it's actually a clever and complex observation of a thirty-something trapped in her high school years who just never became an adult. Her practical stalking of an old flame is believable and oddly touching despite being completely inappropriate, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion that fits the setup. The whole thing works because of Patton Oswalt's character who is also stuck in his life because of events at high school but helps lift the otherwise melancholic tone.<br /><br />I think most people will either love this or hate it. It's different to Reitman's other films such as Up in the Air but the same in that there's an undercurrent of malaise, frustration and boredom in his version of American culture. It's an uneasy film to watch but it's also smart enough to make the audience think - if you can get passed the inherent bleakness.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|There is definitely something wonky with this app. It can't seem to make up its mind what the weather is like outside my house.

B003O86FMW|5.0|My favorite story to date. Finished book 3 last week....fabulous. This is an adult series and in my opinion you shouldn't let your young children read them.

B006H3MIV8|1.0|[[ASIN:B006W5JF9Y Chimes Of Freedom: The Songs Of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years Of Amnesty International]<br /><br />I bought the album - all 4 cds - this morning via MP3 download. File quality is excellent, and the download process was relatively painless (one has to download the Amazon Download Manager first). That's the end of the good news, especially if you've been around long enough to have heard both the original deal as well as multiple, excellent covers of Dylan songs.<br /><br />I listened to all 4 CDs as I worked around the house but the sole cover that made me sit down and listen closely was Bryan Ferry's cover of \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\". The rest of it seems an unending stream of rough voices without charm, inexplicable metallic rock versions of standard Dylan tunes (too many to list. Really) In short, I wish I had my money back. I realize this is for charity and all that. The artists involved clearly contributed as best they could. I applaud them for their efforts. It would be nice if most of them were actually musicians. Growling into a microphone isn't a substitute for singing, and it surely isn't much of a device for nuance. As I write this I'm listening, jaw agape, to the single worst version of \\"Don't Think Twice\\" ever recorded. I've no idea who Kesha is, but she surely needs a therapist at least as much as a singing coach.<br /><br />In the truest of all possible true worlds, this effort would be flung immediately into the rubbish, and the dumpster lid firmly secured to avoid further contamination. As it is, this compilation gives torture and \\"enhanced interrogation\\" a good name. Still, it's for charity. It's got an awful beat and you can't dance to it....I'll give it a star. The Health Department needs to close up this restaurant.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ana and \\"Mr. Grey\\" are complicated characters.  I enjoyed seeing how their relationship began and how it developed. Christian is a control freak while Ana is an innocent that finds she has a connection between them. It's exploring that connection that makes it complicated. Because Christian likes to be in control he has a \\"red room of pain\\" as Ana calls it. Christian explains that it's not supposed to be painful on it's on...the pain causes pleasure. So, Ana experiments with Christian because she really cares for the man and hopes to change his lifestyle.<br /><br />The reason I gave the book 3 stars is because overall I was just disappointed. I guess because of the reviews I expected MORE. The sex scenes were...ok. I've read more passionate books by far. Most of the reviews I read said that he was the Ultimate Alpha male. All I can say is, not really. He gives in to Ana every chance he gets. There are a few, and I stress few, places in the book that he takes the domineering to a good level but other than that...  Well, again, I wanted MORE emotion, I guess. If he is going to be the strong silent type that dictates everything then he needs to stay that way throughout the book until the heroin changes him if that is the direction the book is going, which this one obviously isn't. He gave in too much to be the big macho man I thought he was going to be.
006197806X|5.0|Lauren Oliver did a fantastic job on both Delirium and Pandemonium.<br />Pandemonium is everything and more that I could have asked for in a sequel, engaging, heart pounding and all around captivating.  I was completely enchanted by the characters and story line.  The plot was beautifully written and the story line was original.  It has been a long time since I have read a book so fast.  I was completely drawn in.<br />Oliver's writing is perfect.  From the very first chapter she grabs your attention and holds you incased until you finish the book.  I really enjoyed the way the chapters flowed from the Then and the Now, and I still did not find myself confused with the way the chapters were changing back and forth.  I was actually wanting to know what was happening when I was in the now, while I was reading the then and vise versa.<br />I can not wait for the next installment.

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I've never been a fan of Channing Tatum for an assorted number of reasons. My principle reason for my disliking Channing Tatum is his lack of acting talent. His deficiencies as an actor were made apparent in every genre of film. Ever since he broke onto the scene with \\"Step Up\\",he has delivered his signature one-note performance in every movie in which he has been cast. And it seemed as if he would never get any better. I was ready to give up on him until I read the reviews for \\"21 Jump Street\\". Not only was the movie supposed to be well done, but Mr. One Note Channing Tatum was supposed to have turned in one of his best performances as well. Out of a morbid sense of curiosity, I had to see the movie for myself; and after nearly two hours of continuous guffawing, I left the theatre with a new sense of hope. Channing Tatum may have found his niche as a movie actor:he can be a funny man. Channing Tatum is......funny.<br /><br />I remember watching 21 Jump Street as a youngster in the 1980's. I loved it when it was on network television.  The premise: a bunch of young looking 20 something detectives pose as high school students as they attempt to curb the criminal activity that is perpetrated by high school students. This show became a career launching pad for many of the principle characters, including the venerable and legendary Johnny Depp. However, the show has become pretty dated, and I doubt that I could watch it with the same enthusiasm now that I'm in my thirties. And when I heard that they were remaking this television show for the big screen, I nearly gagged. But after seeing the movie remake with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, I have to say that I am so happy that I went against my instincts and saw this film.  It is the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time. I actually laughed out loud while watching this movie, and it has been a long time since I have laughed out loud during any film.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is not difficult to follow. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are enemies in high school; with Channing Tatum being the popular high school jock(Jenko), while Jonah Hill is the socially awkward and geeky Eminem look-a-like(Schmidt). A few years after they graduate from high school, they enroll in the police academy. While at the academy, they discover that Schmidt is able to master the academic part of the training and Jenko is able to master the physical aspect of the police training. Jenko and Schmidt soon realize that if they are to make it past their respective exams, they are going to have to help one another. Their decision to cooperate with each other leads to a special friendship, and after graduating from the academy they are able to secure assignments in the same police unit.<br /><br />Jenko and Schmidt prove to be inept as police officers in the bike unit, but they are given a second chance as undercover police officers. Their mission: infiltrate a drug operation in a high school that is run by a smarmy high school senior played by David Franco(James Franco's brother). Here the roles of Jenk and Schmidt are reversed. It is Jenko who is the social outcast while Schmidt is the cool insider. Turns out that in the year 2012 it is okay to be openly gay, carry your backpack using both straps, openly campaign for the preservation of the environment, and do well in school-which are all of the traits that Jenko used to hate about Schmidt. While they are trying to infiltrate the drug operation, Schmidt's popularity causes a rift in their friendship; and as their relationship collapses, so does their work as undercover officers. Eventually their antagonistic supervisor(played by Ice Cube!!!) has to fire them, and all hope seems to be lost for the two former friends. It does not take long for Jenko and Schmidt to become friends again; and with their friendship repaired they are able to prove their worth as officers through their special form of vigilantism.<br /><br />As I've said before, Channing Tatum is really funny in this film. Jonah Hill and Ice Cube also deliver some really good liners as well. Although a remake, the film is original in its execution of the conventional screenplay. I highly recommend this film. And I have to say that if you choose to see this movie, you will be greeted with a really nice surprise near the end.atum is really funny in this film.

Bass frequencies do not get muddy, even on bad pre-mixes.  I find I can isolate distinct sectors of the soundstage more easily with these headphones than any other I have tried.<br /><br />The cord is long and strong and has never come apart from the plug or the headphones.<br /><br />The wear is very comfortable on these.  Straight 48 hour sessions with no ear fatigue or equipment induced headaches.<br /><br />CON: I cant complain...After 14 years, the material covering the ear padding slightly came apart form the headphone housing.  It has been a year since, and hasnt gotten worse.  And this is with daily use!  Not too bad at all...and no one I know could even wear the headphones they bought 15 years ago, nevermind use them daily.  So a little tear is an acceptable trade off for long term use.<br /><br />Like other posters, I have tried a lot of other options on the market in the last 20 years and these have ALWAYS been my favorites.<br /><br />For only $100, you could say the same thing in 15 years.  How many other models can stand up to that?<br /><br />Good luck!
B004XISI4A|4.0|I was thoroughly intimidated by the criticisms of Book 5 of A Dance with Dragons, procrastinated about purchasing, and then was given a gift voucher, so decided to buy.  Thank goodness I did.  I know, I know... it is not nearly as exciting as books 1 - 3, but it filled all the empty spaces, not with a waste of words, but with facts, and people that I have grown to love.  As an author it must be demoralising to receive so many bad criticisms, imagine trying to keep all the characters in this enormous series in order!  I cannot wait for Book 6 to come out on Kindle, and look forward to increasing my knowledge of my \\"other\\" family and country!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book was horrid.  It just seemed as though Suzanne didn't know what to do with most of her characters... her answer to that problem: KILLED THEM OFF.  Then guess what, she needed more characters for the invasion so she made, used, then didn't know what to do so guess what she did: KILLED THEM OFF AGAIN!  Again i say just horrible.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|Everything everyone else has said about how wonderful this show is sums up my feelings on it as well, so I need not repeat it.  I saw this for the first time on PBS while waiting in the emergency room to be treated for acute bronchitis, and I couldn't help but sing along to the numbers as I watched it. And even though I was in respiratory distress, I still had more breath support than Nick Jonas.  However, while a lot of people are ripping on Nick for being an awkward and disappointing addition to the cast, he does not ruin the production for me. He does lack some stage presence among the other actors who play the students, and certainly his vocal style does not blend well among the ensemble, but he is truly not horrible. He's just a pop vocalist, not a musical theater performer.<br /><br />Alfie Bow's rendition of Bring Him Home brought tears to my eyes, and his standing ovation for that number was well, well deserved.
B0078JPCJK|5.0|This is a wonderful series. I love the English manor houses, the differences<br />in the social structure and watching the people react as only humans can, regardless of upbringing and culture. It is very entertaining and extremely well done.

0439023513|3.0|It is impossible to review Mockingjay without reflecting also on the first two books of the trilogy. I found the Hunger Games to be a riveting action/fantasy that propelled me from page to page.  At the same time, a feeling of discomfort built with each page with the increasing realization that this was a novel whose drama was based on the sadistic slaughter of children.  The two main protagonists were magnificent, brave and compelling but the heroics involved being forced to kill 13 and 14 year olds.<br />As Hunger Games evolves into Catching Fire, the characters seek to pull the mask off of this display to expose it to the citizens of Panem for what it really is: not true drama, not true romance, not even true celebrity - just forcing children to be gladiators and assuring that their demise is as gruesome as possible.<br />In Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins essentially assures that the mask is pulled off for the readers as well.  Mockingjay is not just a statement about the harsh realities of war, it is not just the story of exposing to Panem the horror that lies beneath the cloak of romance, celebrity and bravery - it is, in a sense also a rebuke to her readers as she heavy-handidly details the grim unraveling of the three main characters and the horrific butchering of the other secondary characters.  The Hunger Games is a thrilling romance of dashing bravery with some disturbing undertones of sadism.  Mockingjay concludes the trilogy with an expose of how brutal, sordid and contrived the games really are.  Suzanne Collins seems to want to thrill her readers with the first book and chastise with the third.  As this huge success goes to film, I'm left with some discomfort about her having it both ways.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think you people who made this game are awesome!!!!I hope everyone loves this game!Love this game!I love this game!
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|The photos of this app show it used as a widget on the home screen, but in fact can not be used as a widget.  :(. Kind of the whole reason I downloaded it.  And for as much space as it takes up, you'd think it would have a widget feature.  It doesn't pinpoint location either.  Its pretty is about the only good thing its got going for it.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|This was an amusing story that I wished I could have liked better.  It started well enough with Rango in his original home, but the location was so bleak and a lot of the characters not very 'huggable' like one would expect from an animated feature.  The voice work was good and there were a few laugh-out-loud parts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had gotten away from reading science fiction and now I want to clunk myself on the head for not reading it for years.  This was a wonderful way back into a genre I loved as a teenager.  I'm hooked again.  Rich characters you feel you know, fast paced, a mystery, a love story, an epic adventure.  I too stayed up till sometimes 2-3am several nights in a row because I couldn't stop reading it.  I must admit I didn't like the first two story lines.  Later I realized that it's good vs. evil and you must get through the evil parts in the beginning to appreciate the good that comes later.  Hang in, it's worth the ride.  I see Spielberg making the movie.
B005XBA9Y8|4.0|After decades spent listening with mild interest to classical records but with little knowledge about where to invest in an actual collection, I've happily discovered the recent releases of \\"bargain-priced\\" mega-collections like this Mercury set.  (See also Decca, RCA, and DG.)  After buying a couple of these I'm discovering that at least one reason these are so low-priced is that the information provided about the recordings on each set is about as bare bones as it gets, and the back sides of the CD sleeves are about as ugly as information presented on a CD sleeve can be.<br /><br />Thus I'm very thankful for the long, detailed reviews appearing to the left of this one, which provide some useful information about both what's in this set and what's perhaps to come if there's a vol. 2 or what to hunt around for elsewhere if there isn't.  This beginner listener appreciates those reviewers taking the time to list the contents and provide some notes on the results.  Otherwise, I find myself looking up a lot of info about many of these pieces on Wikipedia!<br /><br />After spending a few weeks with this set, I think it's likely that the true classical music buff may not appreciate this set as a keeper.  However, it might be useful in providing \\"loaner\\" copies to friends to get them interested.  \\"Here, listen to this,\\" without the fear that some expensive out-of-print recording gets lost in someone else's home.  There is some great music to be heard and discovered here, and much of it not as familiar to the casual classical listener who has never tried to learn about it.  (I'm quite happy to discover, for instance, the music of William Grant Still, found here as part of disc 3, \\"Fiesta Hi-Fi\\".)  But the lack of any real information about most of the works, the composers, or the specific performances may keep this from being a cherished collection, as it forces the listener to look elsewhere to find out about these more obscure composers.  (Not even the original album liner notes have been reproduced on the sleeves, as one sometimes finds in other sets.)<br /><br />For myself, it's still a helpful introduction to the wide scope of what constitutes classical music recordings (particularly how much of it isn't by just the familiar dozen or so names one encounters in a college music appreciation class) as well as some of its performers.  I hope there is a Volume 2 to come, and I hope with it comes a better effort by Mercury (or whichever megacorp holding company owns these recordings) to provide more than skeletal information and in a more elegant design than done here.  Seriously, maybe a dedicated website with more thorough notes about each disc would be feasible. But if it keeps the price low not to do such things, at least there will be the music in an affordable and compact case, and after all, this music is meant to be listened to and not read about.

B006SMLAMQ|1.0|From what I've read, there is no widget, which defeats the purpose of the app in my opinion.  And it wouldn't install.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|The Descendants: overall ~ A-W-F-U-L! ~ story-wise. The acting was good, but the characters were unlikable and unsympathetic, though the youngest daughter got more sympathetic midway through. I thought it a waste of my time and $2 rental price.<br /><br />The story was sappy and contrived.<br /><br />The husband (George Clooney) after living for years in a bad marriage finds out his wife has been cheating on him ~ after she's injured and put in a coma. He then invites his teen daughter along to set out to find the guy (great guidance dad ~ it's your wife you needed long ago to deal with before your daughter's got screwed up.) Anyway, they find him and via that the `other man's' wife learns about the affair.<br /><br />So she comes to the hospital with flowers to meet the `other woman.' A friendly looking gesture, that turns into a one-sided hospital bed confrontation. What? It would be hysterical, except that this was supposed to be a serious scene. The woman then goes into this incredibly nauseating speech about forgiveness, because she has to. As I'm watching, I'm wondering why go after the `other person?' Isn't it your husband (or wife as the case may be) that you should be screaming bloody murder and throwing out on their a__? And for Clooney's character, according to him it was a very bad marriage so what's with the incredibly sappy `I love you' speech to his dying wife? Yes, she's dying, you might want to send her off well, but he didn't need to pretend the marriage was something other than what he had been saying all the way through the movie ~ or was it guilt because he didn't let her buy her own boat ~ as his father-in-law repeatedly stated?<br /><br />All in all spend your time on something much more enriching and entertaining.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Another great game from Fire Maple Games. Nice, fun challenge to keep you occupied for awhile. Check out Grisley Manor too.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay transforms the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy from great entertainment into a masterpiece. I enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" for what they were: good pulpy young adult sci-fi. They were very well written and paced, and Collins showed an absolute gift for fleshing characters out in just a few words. But at the end of a day, it was a pretty standard story of \\"noble heroine does battle with evil empire in fantastic sci-fi world.\\" The sort of thing you enjoy then forget two days later.<br /><br />Mockingjay changes all that. Katniss is now more than just a swashbuckling heroine, but is becoming an active, critical part of the rebellion. Yet even as she wins more power, she realizes more and more clearly just how powerless she really is. It's a real truth, which Mockingjay dares to explore, that the most visible/important people are often the most constrained and powerless. Indeed, there's a brilliant scene towards the end where an extremely unlikely teacher gets through to Katniss just how much a pawn she is. Ultimately, the one really important, world-changing thing Katniss does on her own is completely unexpected, but perfectly in character.<br /><br />Mockingjay also tackles the costs of war, with all of the major characters changing dramatically as the battle goes on. It's true, as some reviewers have complained, that Katniss does not get to be front and center for many crucial events. Yet the best works involving war, from \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" focus not on the great and powerful, but on ordinary people, doing their best to survive with some shreds of happiness and dignity. It's brave of Collins to try and join this pantheon, instead of giving her fanbase what it wants -the heroine slaying dragons and choosing her prince charming. But she succeeds, and my hat is off to her.<br /><br />The ending, I thought, was a masterstroke, providing resolution, but also making it clear that some things cannot -and more importantly should not- be completely resolved.<br /><br />If you want a straightforward adventure epic where the good guys get to be noble, kill the bad guys, and live happily ever after, this is not the book for you. I recommend the Twilight Saga. But if you want a seriously great book about young people doing their best in a cruel, complicated world, I recommend Mockingjay.

B007JRU2UK|3.0|This movie was fine. Only fine. Clooney plays the same guy he always plays, down to the somewhat campy and overplayed looks of shock and surprise (see the bar/taco joint scene...).<br /><br />Love A. Payne. Sideways and Election were fantastic. This particular movie was overrated, however.

B0000959N0|4.0|The Man without Fear hits the movie theaters and delivers in some areas and questionably in others. Ben Affleck plays a good enough Matt Murdock and his costume looks better than the ones in the old comic books. The fight scene at the bar needed some editing but most of the other scenes were somewhat good to very good. Garner delivers an average performance as Elektra. One of the problems with this film is that there were several logic holes. See spoilers at the very end if you want to read about some of them. Good choice with darkness and lights. Pretty good soundt rack fitting the themes of Daredevil even if some of the lyrics are a bit too much on the nose. Jon Favreu plays the beloved sidekick Froggy, Colin Firth plays Bullseye, Michael Clarke Duncan plays the Kingpin, Erik Avari plays Elektra's father and Joe Pantoliono plays the intrepid reporter. Small appearance by Ellen Pompeo, as the secretary of Murdock and Froggy's firm, who would later star in \\"Grey's Anatomy\\". The Razzies nominated Affleck for worst actor but the nomination was unjustified. The budget for this film was $79M and made just a tad under $180M at the Box Office. Even though it did well there were a number of attempts to continue with the franchise but too many obstacles have yet to produce Daredevil 2. All said, a refresh to Daredevil is in the works and that's the main reason I watched this film again. SPOILERS: Elektra should have known she was fighting Matt long before she removed his mask; the fight scene between Matt and Elektra looked cool but a blind guy fighting it out publicly in front of a ton of kids is going to get passed around and then the secret identity is revealed. Woops. If his opponents knew that extreme noises would stun Daredevil why didn't they use them to great impact at the end of the film rather than fighting off? Those dudes weren't exactly chivalrous in combat. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; ACTION SCENES: B minus to B; TONE/CINEMATOGRAPHY:B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday (2nd viewing); OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.

B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I didn't purchase this dvd from Amazon. So this review is only for the product itself.<br /><br />As a nineteen year old person who discovered the Beatles a year ago I can tell you that this dvd is a must-have for Beatles fans old and new. The performances are in astounding quality for the time period and the dvd includes the full episodes of each show so that you you can see cool things like what commercials were like in the 60's. The sound and picture quality are both good, the quality of the performances themselves are impeccable, and this dvd does a great job of capturing the feel of the 60's. But for me, the best part of owning these dvds came this weekend. When I watched these performances and some snippets of the episodes with my 62 year old grandmother who is a huge Beatles fan and originally saw the performances in 1964 and 1965 live when they aired on television. Seeing the excitement and nostalgia on my grandmothers face was a lovely experience. My personal opinion is that everyone who loves the Beatles should purchase this and enjoy it with their family members. Truly something special.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|The most deliciously featherlight of Jane Austen's novels, NORTHANGER ABBEY combines the authors' signature class observations with a parody of the penny-thrillers which were the secret guilty pleasure for many during the era.  This version, broadcast in 2007 as part of a special season of new Jane Austen dramatisations for ITV, will satisfy those who didn't care for the BBC's 1987 attempt, which has divided Austen-philes for years.<br /><br />Eighteen-year-old Catherine Morland (Felicity Jones) leaves her family's country home to stay with old friends Mr and Mrs Allen for a holiday in Bath.  There, Catherine's innocent demeanour attracts the attention of warm-hearted Henry Tilney (JJ Feild - \\"The Sally Lockhart Mysteries\\") and his sister Eleanor (Catherine Walker);  but also falls prey to the subtle manipulations of Isabella Thorpe (Carey Mulligan - \\"Bleak House\\"), a young woman who insists that she cares little for money but whose actions show otherwise.  When Henry's father General Tilney (Liam Cunningham) invites Catherine to travel back with his family to their ancestral estate of Northanger Abbey, Catherine's vivid imagination - fed on a steady diet of pulp fiction gothic thrillers for years - goes into overdrive conjuring up all manner of terrifying family secrets stored within it's walls.<br /><br />This is altogether a far more satisfying screen treatment of Jane Austen's story, and that is mainly due to Andrew Davies' script, which retains a strong flavour of the original novel.  One of the main failings of the 1987 BBC version was a tendency to fight against its source (eg: a bizarre 80's New Age-wannabe soundtrack, several extra characters added for no particular reason).  Period drama fans know they are always in good hands with Andrew Davies (\\"Vanity Fair\\", \\"Wives and Daughters\\", \\"Daniel Deronda\\", \\"Bleak House\\", 2008's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", not to mention his magnum opus, the 1995 \\"Pride & Prejudice\\"), but whilst NORTHANGER ABBEY is the one Austen story which can comfortably be retold within the span of a regular movie length, I truly hope that one day we'll see a longer miniseries incarnation.  Saying that, I particularly enjoyed the bookending narration provided by \\"Jane Austen\\" herself - a charming addition; and Davies has captured the characters with his usual skill.<br /><br />Performances are fantastic.  1987's Katharine Schlesinger was, in my opinion, the strongest component of that otherwise-iffy screen version, but I adored Felicity Jones' performance as Catherine.  She is all you could possibly want and is perfectly-paired with JJ Feild's adorable Henry (Peter Firth he ain't - and that's a good thing here).  Carey Mulligan offers a coy and coolly manipulative Isabella.  Mrs Allen is played with a great comedic flair by Sylvestra Le Touzel - well-known to period drama fans as Fanny Price in the BBC's 1983 miniseries of \\"Mansfield Park\\", as well as Lady Jane Crawley in Andrew Davies' 1998 \\"Vanity Fair\\".<br /><br />All in all a charming new NORTHANGER ABBEY.  Buyers should be aware however that the DVD released in the States by PBS/Masterpiece is an edited version which removes several small scenes.  The uncut version is available on DVD from the UK.tory which can comfortably be retold within the span of a regular movie length, I truly hope that one day we'll see a longer miniseries incarnation.

B001GKJ2DY|3.0|First, let me preface this by saying that I enjoy Abba's music. This is basically a group of Abba songs loosely tied together with a charming storyline. Despite its relatively weak storyline, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. I don't remember the last time I saw a movie where the actors seemed to really enjoy themselves. Kudos to the established actors for singing their songs (vs. lip synching) - particularly gorgeous Pierce Brosnan, who doesn't have the most lyrical of voices. That takes courage. By the same token, I was impressed by the musical voices of Meryl Streep and Colin Firth. The vocal talents of young Amanda Siegfried are impressive. Of course scenes of the beautiful Adriatic just add to the enjoyment, as does seeing the always handsome Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan in the same film. So, if you want an uncomplicated movie that just leaves you feeling good - maybe singing a few Abba songs - rent this movie.

B0071MV540|3.0|We watched this last night and it was an ok movie. Not to much swearing or sex which we are so tired of hearing and seeing in movies. Eddy Murphy was the only one that was offensive and he usually is with his mouth, but he represented the (bad guy) and that is supposedly how they comunicate. It was over all entertaining that is why I gave it the 3 stars.

B0002W4SWC|4.0|Quirky, fun movie. Hadn't seen this in several years but after seeing it again, I decided to buy the DVD. It's a movie that can always bring a smile to your face. Renée Zellweger is adorable in this role as the hapless but always optimistic Bridget. The film captures handsome and talented Colin Firth with some particularly sexy, penetrating gazes. Hugh Grant shows that he can be a humorous cad. Under Special Features, Renée discusses how she prepared for the movie - she moved to the UK several months before the shoot started and took a job in a publishing firm (incognito, of course). She also kept her British accent both on and off-screen such that Hugh Grant didn't realize she was Texan until the \\"wrap-up party\\". Pretty impressive dedication to the craft and it paid off.

B002ONC9NC|3.0|Coming of age story set in 1960's England.  Alfred Molina gives another superb performance as the dominant yet loving father who is at odds with his bright teenage daughter.  Young Carey Mulligan does a fine job blossoming from naive schoolgirl to young woman. Peter Sarsgaard is convincing as the seductive, though suspicious older David, who sweeps Jenny off her feet.<br /><br />In some ways, the conflict between what Jack wants for his daughter (stability) and what Jenny thinks she wants (David's glamorous, though somewhat shady lifestyle) parallels the 1960's.  The conventional life of the 1950's was giving way to rock-and-roll and a greater sense of freedom/curiosity.<br /><br />Unfortunately, although the actors do a good job and the cinematography is solid, the movie is rather formulaic.

B003ASLJQS|4.0|Suspenseful, well-paced thriller performed by a top-notch cast and directed superbly. Tim Robbins gives a terrific performance as the relatively dull-witted Dave who gets caught in the crossfire of a wife who jumps to the wrong conclusions and bad circumstantial evidence.  A classic...worth seeing again and again.

B0028DRGDQ|5.0|I'm always a bit skeptical of buying ANYTHING horror related after the 90's. Lets face it, most of it is recycled bits and pieces of every other movie ever made. I took a chance on this because of things I've read about the movie, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The thing I was most afraid of was the \\"video camera\\" style POV that I read most reviews mention. I thought it was going to be grainy, and all over the place like other films of this type. I was pleasanly surpised. It's not bad at all! Although its supposed to be a raw footage type of feel, it's very easy to adjust to. It doesn't shake around the whole time giving you headaches and making the movie hard to watch. It's perfect.<br /><br />I also really liked the absence of a score. Thats what made it feel authentic. Of course there's not really going to be a zombie outbreak, but no music made it feel like it really was just a news girl trying to get a story. There wasn't any \\"over the top\\" blood. It was just the right amount.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a really well put together movie. It's got everything you could want. There's some startling moments, there's some frightening moments. I get a real rush and a sense of excitement when I watched this movie. Thats something I don't ever get hardly anymore. I would highy recommend this movie to any fan of zombie films, or horror in general.

My only problem isn't such a big deal but I don't like how from season 3 on the theme song changed from \\" I don't wanna wait\\" to \\"run like mad\\" a corny, cheesy song that in its lyrics talk about suits of armor and hearts and arrows and sunsets. Very lame but doesn't take away from the show itself. Love this show. So glad I have it and its somthing I will keep forever!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Ordered five season's of Gilmore's Girls, they all came in earlier thatn I expected and were in great shape!  Great Service and Product!
B004CFBMRY|3.0|An interesting book which holds the readers attention. It is a very fasctinating account; but at times seems a bit flippant and casual and leaves one wondering if some of the underlying conclusions and outcomes are really well researched. I for one would be hesitant to run in \\"minimilistic\\" running shoes and risk injury though the book seems to suggest that it is the way to go to avoid injury. Would be interesting to see what interested parties like shoe companies think.

B005J6LKVI|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the year! I've read the book and the movie is made pretty much based on it without much alteration, given it is a 500+ pages book. The story line is convincing even if you haven't read the book, and the characters are very well played by Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, and other amazing actors. I love the flow of the story and how the movie just grips you the minute it starts. I'm not gonna talk about the movie itself because I'm sure most people who watch it must have read the book already. It is a well portrayed movie that simply grabs your heart. Not a scene can be deleted, no more no less, just perfect. You'll laugh and cry with the characters and will want more when it ends. And you'll find yourself watching it again and again and never get tired. That's how good it is!

B0009MWAVQ|5.0|To award this collection anything less than 5 stars would be absurd, particularly for anyone who loves the unique sonority of the harpsichord. Moreover, Scott Ross is the only performer other than Pieter-Jan Belder who has rendered Scarlatti's vast oeuvre almost exclusively on harpsichord (with only a smattering of exceptions played on organ at the end of this set).<br /><br />Regarding sonority, it might be well to expand a bit on the harpsichord's special qualities, since these often get overlooked - or mischaracterized - when evaluating performances of Scarlatti's works. It's also helpful, I think, in assessing Scott Ross's own contributions.<br /><br />First, Scarlatti was obviously a lover of \\"proto-flamenco\\" guitar music - the kind performed by peasants in 18th century Spain. Scarlatti must have heard these guitarists after moving from his native Italy to the royal palace of Madrid, where he was installed as court harpsichordist. This city, after all, is where he wrote most of his 555 sonatas for Queen Mar&iacute;a B&aacute;rbara, who was a student of Scarlatti and a brilliant musician in her own right. Admittedly, we have no tangible record of \\"proto-flamenco\\" as played by early guitarists, but they must have been present in Spain at the time of Scarlatti's tenure. Ralph Kirkpatrick, who remains the definitive biographer of Scarlatti, assures us that the composer was often influenced by these performances, though it's doubtful that they provided any more than a \\"template\\" for his works.<br /><br />These influences have relevance for the sonatas in that, like the guitar, the harpsichord is a plucked instrument, and its sonorities are therefore closer to the guitar than the piano. There are, of course, many opinions on just what bearing this has on performances of Scarlatti's music - especially since the composer was almost equally influenced by Italian operatic and instrumental traditions - but to ignore this affinity is, I believe, a mistake. Further, many of Scarlatti's sonatas have a quintessentially \\"plucked\\" character - notes are written in such a way that they can only be rendered properly on the harpsichord (or guitar). They require an extremely crisp and \\"needle\\"-like attack, which the \\"rounder\\" sound of the piano cannot capture.<br /><br />This brings me to Scott Ross, whom I believe does absolute justice to both the proto-flamenco and Italian traditions in these sonatas. Before Ross, perhaps only Kirkpatrick had so thoroughly realized Scarlatti's tonal and structural effects in his performances of the late fifties and sixties. However, Kirkpatrick recorded only about one-sixth of Scarlatti's repertoire, so many superb sonatas remained buried in the archives.<br /><br />Kirkpatrick's example shows that Scarlatti's range was undervalued, since no keyboardists had recorded more than a small percentage of his works. There are various reasons for this, but some are attributable to a certain inertia among professional keyboardists when it comes to musical selections. Too often the same pieces get played again and again, and while this certainly helps illustrate how many ways a work can be rendered, it also leaves a distorted picture.<br /><br />And what of Scott Ross's interpretations? I'd have to echo previous reviewers and say they're almost invariably superb. I say \\"almost,\\" because I feel that in a few cases the beauty of some sonatas fails to come through. Perhaps the worst example is Sonata K 491 in D Minor, which Ross tears through like an express train and almost ruins in the process. This is an incredibly beautiful piece when played at the right tempo - for example, listen to Igor Kipnis's performance of this sonata on the CD, \\"The Spanish Harpsichord,\\" where the sparkling arpeggios settle on the listener like star-fall and amply demonstrate the idiomatic perfection of a great performance. Luckily, such \\"lapses\\" are rare, so I think that in most cases we are getting an above-average rendering, and often a definitive one.<br /><br />By giving us the entire repertoire, Scott Ross enables us to discover some jewels that few other performers have recorded thus far. Take sonata K. 48 in C Minor, a beautifully atmospheric flamenco dance piece, and as colorful as anything I've heard from a Baroque-era composer. Or K. 298 in D Major, where Scarlatti employs a pyrotechnic display of repeated notes and coruscating \\"orchestral\\" effects that must be heard to be believed - this is one of the composer's most idiomatic works that cannot be adequately realized on a piano.<br /><br />To mention just two other gems:  K. 500, another kinetic work that evokes the Spanish origins of so many of these sonatas. And, finally:  K. 477 in G major, which Ralph Kirkpatrick called a musical \\"fox hunt,\\" and is a truly joyous romp. It's hard to sit still through performances like these, and in more cases than not, I'd say these versions are superior to those of Pieter-Jan Belder.<br /><br />In sum, this is the best collection of Scarlatti's sonatas ever made, and I doubt it will ever be superceded. True, the price is forbidding, but considering the quality of this set, it's far from unjustified..<br /><br />By giving us the entire repertoire, Scott Ross enables us to discover some jewels that few other performers have recorded thus far.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love this game. It's worth the dollar. Get it.  I play it all the time. Each level, gets harder and harder. Its not easy, it takes skills.
0393325172|4.0|I have read the entire series and found it a fascinating and rewarding experience.  There is a common misconception that these are \\"men's books\\" that few women will appreciate.  To the contrary, these books remind me very much of Jane Austin--they contain deep insights into society, character, and the relationships between men and women.<br /><br />These books are set on land as much, if not more, than they are at sea, and explore the love lives, relationships, finances, and social struggles of the two main characters and of their love interests.  The female characters are as well-drawn and believably developed as the male and form the core of many of the author's narratives.<br /><br />I grant that some of the naval jargon can be daunting (there are some wonderful books and web sites out there to help you with that), but the stories are deeply engrossing and provide a window of astonishing clarity not just into the Royal Navy, but into early 19th Century Britain.  These are not only enjoyable books, they are important books, and come highly recommended.<br /><br />The only reason for the four stars rather than five is that the naval nomenclature, and the medical as well, can be difficult at times.  But, it is well worth the effort.

B006P0FICE|3.0|The poor acting for the roles of Cardinal Richelieu, Constance and Rochefort's captain of the guard  leave a LOT to be desired, and while a bit better in their performance, even Athos and the Duke of Buckingham (played by our beloved Orlando Bloom) were disappointing. (I give kudos to the Queen Anne in this version which was very well acted by Juno Temple).<br /><br />The role of D'Artagnan is played by an actor with a face of an 8-yr old, the body of a scrawny 12-yr old boy, and one you are hard pressed to believe he'd ever had the slightest experience with any girls. While he seems to pull off the action movements smoothly, he is just all around NOT BELIEVABLE in this role and so (I believe) was a poor casting choice for a main character.<br /><br />They (seem) to have spared no expense on the sets and costumes, and the addition of DaVinci's vault and his \\"flying war ships\\" were brilliant updates to the usual story, but they went a bit too high tech having laser beam security (of all things) in the queen's jewelry vault, and Melady using a small blow of powder from a compact to be able to see the beams.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  It is not without flaws, and in my opinion does not hold a candle to the 1993 version, (starring Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Tim Curry, Oliver Platt, Michael Wincott, and Chris O'Donnell - which is a tough version to beat!) but the sets, the DaVinci updates to the story, and the fight scenes are very enjoyable - (at one point they even slow down the action sequence for you, which I'm sure you'll appreciate) - so it's ABSOLUTELY WORTH VIEWING if you enjoy swashbuckling type movies.  Those who have not seen the 1993 version will surely think more highly of this version.<br /><br />NOTE:  If you haven't seen the 1993 version I mentioned, I highly recommend that one - it's superbly done and very enjoyable.

B007B6T3K4|5.0|There really isn't much I can say that other reviewers haven't covered. The sound is different (occasionally reminiscent of old Xandria, but over all very different) and the singer does sound strikingly like Tarja for some songs, but I personally thought she sounded a lot different than Tarja on other ones.<br /><br />What I can say that other people haven't is a song by song review, since no one else has.<br /><br />1: A prophecy of Worlds To Fall: The opening first few minutes of this one is very epic  with choir sounds and then bombastic as guitars are added in, but then it slows down to a more moderate pace for the rest of the song. It's a great opening to the album. I give this one a 5/5 stars.<br /><br />2: Valentine: A fast paced song throughout, with a consistent melody,  and in my opinion Manuela  sounds like Tarja the most on this song. Not much made it stand out, however, and it strikes me as the most \\"radio friendly\\" song. 4/5 stars<br /><br />3: Forevermore: A slower song than others but moderately paced in the chorus. I felt there was more influence of old Xandria in this one - it felt similar to  some of the slower songs that have done on previous albums. 4/5<br /><br />4: Euphora: A creepy, haunted sound at the beginning of this song that is then broken by louder guitar sound and Manuela repeats two words a few times and then the lyrics come in into a faster paced song, with occasional breaks in the melody with emphasis on two words and whispering by the male vocalist. This song highlights how this isn't just generic symphonic metal, there is variety within the songs themselves as well as each song sounding different from the next. 4/5<br /><br />5: Blood on my Hands: Moderately paced song with a fast paced chorus. This tune got stuck in my head almost immediately, I find this one very catchy. At about 3:00 is a highlight of the song for me, its a \\"magical\\" sort of sound. 5/5<br /><br />6: Soulcrusher: A heavier song, possibly the heaviest on the album. It's pretty fast paced and there is a good usage of choir sounds. Around 4:50 there are spoken words in male vocals (I don't know what the name of the male vocalist is) and from there I can make out any words, sounds mostly like Manuela humming to me. It's a good song, but not my favorite as it felt sort of bland to me. 3/5<br /><br />7: The Dream is Still Alive: Violin starts off this slower song, but it's absolutely beautiful and yet another one that reminds me of old Xandria. Manuela's voice soars in this song. There's a guitar solo at 2:47 - 3:10 before Manuela's voice comes in with a haunting, wordless melody and then the song continues with the chorus again. 5/5<br /><br />8: The Lost Elysion: This one is fast paced, with plenty of guitar, drums and powerful sining from Manuela. Around 2:59 there's an interesting break down of the song into a guitar solo and the sound is pretty unique, after which Manuela recites some spoken words. 4/5<br /><br />9: Call of the Wind: Violins start off this song and it begins sounding with a very folk/celtic sort of sound. This is also a fast paced song. At about 2:15 there's choir and a very epic sound before it turns again to a folk/celtic sound with violin that I really enjoy, which continues until 3:16 where turns to guitars and then after that Manuela begins singing again. 5/5<br /><br />10: A Thousand Letters: Another song that sounds very celtic to me. It's a song that starts slow then moves to a slightly faster pace, before it slows down again. This song showcases Manuela's beautiful voice perfectly. 5/5<br /><br />11: Cursed: More violin starts this song, before it turns to guitar. This one is heavier than Call of the Wind, with whispered and sort of growled words starting it out. A very catchy song. 5/5<br /><br />12: The Nomad's Crown: The way this song starts out makes me think of the desert and oriental lands, which I imagine is the point, before it turns to a more symphonic metal sound. There is a very catchy,wordless \\"Oooaaah\\" singing melody in this one that I particularly like. Fast to moderate paced song, it does vary. 4/5<br /><br />13: When the Mirror Cracks (Bonus): A moderately fast paced song throughout, somewhat heavier than the rest of the songs. There is again some whispering of words on this song, giving it a sinister sound and good usage of guitars. 4/5<br /><br />14: The Sailor and the Sea (Bonus): A sea shanty, folks-y sound combined with a violin sound that I find very catchy. Quite possibly my favorite song on the entire album. A moderately paced song. 5/5<br /><br />This is an over all outstanding album and it far exceeded my expectations.

B002ZG974M|5.0|I shared this video with high school sophomores as we were studying Chinua Achebe's novel, Things Fall Apart. My intent was to show the African babies, but the students loved it so much they pleaded to see the whole thing. So, a little clip here and a little there as a reward while we moved through other assignments - and they loved it. Babies move even the most cynical hearts. Loved this movie - it's character development without many words.

0060873027|5.0|I LOVED this book.  Sat down and read it in a few hours.  I'm sick of seeing 2-star reviews and hearing negativity.  These same misanthropes wouldn't recognize Jurassic Park if it came along today and they'd bash that too. If you don't like this book, then you don't like Michael Crichton. This is a triumphant return to form, his best novel since Timeline.<br /><br />In answer to someone's comment, Micro DOES NOT feel like someone else wrote it.  Pirate Latitudes felt like a novel written by someone else. The book is PURE CRICHTON and very cohesive throughout (despite the two authors).  Richard Preston does a fine job bringing us one last Crichton adventure.<br /><br />Don't pay attention to these 2-star reviews.  Buy the book right now!  This is the new Crichton novel you never thought you'd get.  It will take you back to that mid-90's Crichton excitement all over again.

B003LZ5B7S|5.0|This TV show, is simply... amazing! Its funny! Its cool... its interesting... Now, I am going to stop blabbering,<br /><br />Quality:<br />The acting, though slightly unnatural at times, is actually suprisingly good for a TV show. Also, TV shows usually are low budget and seem to be poor on the effects, and costumes, and such, but this show hasn't really dissapointed me. Anohter note, I just started to watch the show, and I got so addicted, I watched the full season in three days!<br />For me, the worst thing was the change of actors... or was it? I was soooooooooo dissappointed when I found out that there would be different actors, but let me tell you... I just watched the first episode of the second season, and let me tell you, it's GREAT! It has a slightly different feel, but I think that they improved on it...<br /><br />Humor:<br />Just a quick note, if you are still doubting whether or not to buy the epsiodes... (GET PRIME, AND WATCH THEM ALL FOR FREE) but still, this is a must see.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Sometimes, the plot is a little simplistic, but there are other times were the plot gets nice and twisty... Its not really a thought provoking plot, but its very interesting<br /><br />Last notes:<br />AS I said, it is a must-see. A friend recommended it to me, and I hate him because I am officially addicted to the show. Also, I really wish I could vote a half star, because the first season should be 4 and a half, but only four stars doesn't do it justice... Anyway, I hope this helps, and... it truly is FANTASTIC!!!!
B001W6RRNY|4.0|Very clear and straightforward comparisons. The do´s and dont´s are described with names, faces, specific situations and timelines. Sometimes politically incorrect to the firms that \\"did not last\\", but such incorrectness helps deliver the punchlines. Essential for people working in big organizations, and very helpful for those who want to start a business with a firm footing.

B006SMLAMQ|2.0|When seeing this, I got the impression that it was a widget app or at least had widgets included. Not so. It's a standalone app with no home screen widgets. The app just has widget looking things inside the app.<br /><br />Next as many have pointed out, this thing is HUGE. Mostly due to the background animations. Granted, they are pretty but should have been included as a separate download directly to SD. Personally, I think this app would have simply been better without them.<br /><br />Lastly there is no geo-location setup. You have to manually put in every city you want to see the weather of.<br /><br />Very bad app. Only redeeming factor is that it's pretty to look at for a few minutes before I uninstalled it.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|If you're going to see this delightful movie, the first thing you need to do is to shut down your critical faculties.  Don't ask questions about the state of Ewan McGregor's marriage, or the logic of moving thousands of salmon, or the likelihood of a woman hugging an Arab sheikh in a Muslim country, or the ease with which people travel long distances, and so forth.  It doesn't matter because the gentle tone of the movie - even with the satirical edge of Kristin Scott Thomas' extremely obnoxious but funny Assistant to the Prime Minister - just carries you away.  It's sweet, it's charming, it's not cloying and it definitely draws you in to the story.  This is the first movie I've been in a long time where the character of a Scot is a key plot element.  [What was the name of the wonderful one years ago with Peter  Resier (?) and Burt Lancaster as Texans looking for oil off the cost of Scotland?]  Ewan McGregor gets to use his own Scots accent and is just wonderful and appealing in his role.  Emily Blunt is also good, as she rolls with the plot.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a lovely, gently comic, romantic movie, this is the one.

B007JRU2UK|4.0|as a movie devoted to the theme of a well off family riding out a tough break and regrouping as a father daughters pod, this thing is alien territory for me...it accomplishes that, and fairly well as the tough break is accompanied by one or two difficult dilemmas that roughen the weather a bit, but nothing that cheever's shady hill inhabitants haven't managed as well or better...the upper middle class survives to fight another day...so what else is new?
B00005JM8V|5.0|I loved this series.  It allows the viewer to go deeply inside the Holocaust.  The hidden camera footage of former Nazis was incredible, and I do not recall having seen anything like that anywhere else.  I have watched the series in its entirety 4 times.  There are just so many compelling stories.  I have read some of the other reviews and I was touched by the one about the Polish underground.  I would like to have seen more on that aspect.  I do agree that Lanzmann focused on poor and uneducated Poles.  He really should have balanced it by showing the incredible Nazi brutality toward Poles.  Auschwitz was, after all, first used to house, torture and work to death Polish \\"political\\" prisoners.  Poles were summarily executed with incredible frequency.  They, too, were considered subhuman by the Nazi beasts.  There needs to be a serious effort to lay open that aspect of Polish history.

B003OFHMKO|5.0|Esperanza Spalding must be respected for her incredible abilities as musician. Whether you like her or not, she is an incredibly sensitive singer, virtuoso in her bass playing (I'm not a bass player, so I can only go on what I hear and my limited knowledge of bass). She is a more-than-proficient composer, and her setting of the poetry for \\"Little Fly\\" is exquisite.<br /><br />That being said, I hope she goes far beyond this. I hope she crosses over and works more with Bobby McFerrin, and does classical recordings, and plays with some of the greats in upcoming albums, so that she can continue to grow as an artist. her album, \\"Esperanza\\" is probably my preference, but not because it's better, only because it's different.<br /><br />I purchased the score for this album (a whopping $40 for the PDF file) so that I can study the vocal lines with the composition better. And I'm thrilled that there's a new type of \\"art song\\" in the repertoire for me to perform.

B006SMLAMQ|4.0|greetings fellow amazonians after I woke up from a long busy weekend I checked out the faotd a saw it was a weather app. while I don't necessarily believe in that kind of witchcraft I decided to download it anyway. wow I was shocked at what you can learn from a weather forecast.<br /><br />today's forecast said that there would be thunderstorms I looked out side and it was sunny so I thought that the app was a bunch of malarkey and I went to work at maurey's cheese factory. while the day went on I noticed that there were some clouds on the horizon. when I got off work it was completely cloudy and the wind was whipping around. at this point I knew the app was right. so on my way home I say a lost dog that was busy chewing on a homeless persons pant leg. I knew I had to save it before the storm swept it away. so I jumped out of my car ran over and scooped up the dog. we got back to my house and I felt relieved that he was safe. now I need to figure out how to find its owner. thanks amazon for helping me do a good deed today.
1451648537|3.0|When I began reading this book, I knew little about Jobs.  After reading this book I feel that Jobs doesn't deserve my respect.  His products may very well be wonderful, but he was not.  He treated his family and his employees like dirt.  He was not a hero, he was a jerk.<br /><br />The book is decently well-written, but it feels like the author only talked to a small group of people about Jobs.  The book becomes repetitive, one could read the first and last chapters and get most of the salient points.  The book is at least 200 pages too long.<br /><br />When I began reading, I was excited.  I am in tech and the book provided a lot of background history of the field, which I loved.  But soon I was tired of the book and it became work to finish it.

Definitely buy this case instead of the other $45 marware case because this does the job.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|The writing style of this offering is not great.  Kate (the central chacter) feels, Kate thinks, Kate recalls, and that's the way most of the story is told.  You'd think with so much Kate-centrism, the reader would get a good sense of who Kate is and what she's about.  That didn't really happen for me.  Or perhaps it's just that I never came to share the author's plain admiration for his character.<br /><br />The basic story is a good one, but it's not well told.  The chapters and demi-chapters jump back and forth in time and locale well beyond the point of distraction.  The pages of this manuscript must have been dropped on the editing room floor, and been  haphazardly re-assembled as they were rushed off to the printer.<br /><br />The secondary characters lack definttion.  I understand why Kate views them in different lights through the course of the story which is, in essence, a story that raises the question of \\"Who can you trust?\\". But since Kate trusts no one, it's hard to feel much as she faces betrayals.<br /><br />I feel I deserved something for reading this book to the end.  And I certainly believe that the ending didn't deliver.  I can't recommend this novel.

1594203059|5.0|I have purchased copies of this book for my grandson and godson.  This truly is the Western Civ course that colleges dropped in the early seventies and high schools never offered.  I can't say that being literate and aware of world history is a prerequisite for being a successful citizen but it sure can't hurt.<br /><br />Ferguson is especially important because he brings a knowledge of economics to bear on history.  Most history prof's your kids will be exposed to (if any) will not have had any such exposure much to the detriment of their understanding of cause and effect.<br /><br />Part of the success of our civilization has been tolerance of other views (by most of the people - certainly never all) and Ferguson brings this the fore.  Few of us would agree with everything in this book but the ideas presented a worthy of consideration and add to our understanding.
006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium is the second book in the Delirium series by Lauren Oliver and continues where Delirium ends. (You may want to skip reading this review if you haven't read the first book to avoid spoilers)<br /><br />Pandemonium is a thrilling ride which takes us through Lena Haloway's transition into the wilds with the Invalids as well as present time and how she is adapting.<br /><br />Life for Lena in the wilds is tough, she is still coping with her grief at losing Alex but with the help from Raven she learns to get by, it's a daily struggle to stay healthy, fed and warm but she grows in strength and in courage; she toughens up and lives as they do, she really grew as a character in Pandemonium.<br /><br />In the present time, Lena has taken on a new identity and is tasked with keeping a close eye on the DFA (Delirium Free America), a group supporting the cure and the leader's son Julian who is 18 years old but hasn't yet been cured of Amor Deliria Nervosa due medical problems he has had in the past; his story was heart breaking.<br /><br />I loved the bond Lena and Julian shared but I found myself constantly comparing him to Alex who I absolutely adored. Julian had such an innocence about him that I found endearing, he was a sweetheart BUT he still wasn't Alex.<br /><br />The secondary characters were each developed well, Raven and Tack I especially liked but their betrayal left me squirming and really devastated for Lena.<br /><br />The setting, characterizations, solid plot and amazing writing kept me absolutely riveted, Ms Oliver delivers a thrilling, gripping story with so many twists and turns that held me captivated.<br /><br />The ending has left me shocked, my mouth was literally gaping. So many emotions are evoked and I am so so anxious to get hold of the next book, Requiem to find out the outcome.<br /><br />All in all, Delirium and Pandemonium are complete opposites and I am sure Requiem will be the book that settles everything down and ties it all together. It is an edgy, emotional, complex and thrilling journey we are taken on as Lena discovers not only herself but what she is dealing with in her world. Ms Oliver has certainly impressed me with the amazing story she has weaved.er.

0385344228|5.0|After I watched Emily Rooney interview William Landay on her TV show, Greater Boston, I read his three novels to date in reverse order. Defending Jacob is the third and best. The unexpected turn of plot in Jamaica is the most credible, and there is more laugh-provoking humor in this work (especially in the repartee between Jacob's parents and in arch comments about mothers) than in the preceding two, The Strangler and Mission Flats. But in all three, the development of character is positively Jamesian, evoking recollections of the insightful, analytic descriptions of Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady. This work constitutes a serious exploration of recidivism within and across generations, and, true to the author's disowning of certainty in matters criminal, it suggests but does not dictate conclusions about the disturbing events depicted. Not at all pulp fiction, this novel is several cuts above the contemporary syllabus of crime fiction. This excellent book is, in Milton's phrase, the life blood of a master spirit.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|this app is a waste of space and a waste of time! glad I didn't pay for it! don't download this app!
0439023491|1.0|In its essence, this book's underlying theme is in that category of recent YA fictions attempting via fictions,  role reversals, i.e.,  females as male wannabees. These types of feminist inspired stories try to convince movie-fans and readers that boys are not the predominate hunters and warriors in this wild world with all it's conflicts and wars. It sells girl characters as tougher, stronger and more aggressive combatant fighters than males--boys are now portrayed as they are on much of TV, as dumb, weaklings who always need a female to rescue or smack them, or teach them about life etc..  The bigger problem is when girls go out into the streets and try to act out these make-believe movie tougher-than-guys heroines, they run into the reality that plays by the rules of the street, the wars, the Octagon and sadly, the the real world jungle in spite of our alleged claims to \\"civilized.\\"  Jen Cooper
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved watching the Help, and have seen it probably 3 times, and could watch it again and again.  It is a great movie that tells the story of what life was truly like for maids back in that time.  The fact that this was a true story made it even more entertaining and emotional.<br /><br />The Help made me laugh at times, and almost made me cry.  Growing up I have always been familiar with the civil rights movement and I had a sense of what life must have been like.  With this movie I got to see a glimpse into what life was like leading up to the civil rights movement that changed our country.  And also seeing how much the maids meant to some people, and how much they were mistreated by others.  I believe that this film serves a great purpose in showing my generation how just recently, life wasn't so perfect, and how things truly were in that time.<br /><br />It is a moving film and I recommend it to anyone who is considering to get it.  This film is one that I know that I will treasure for a long time.<br /><br />And I must say that some of my favorite scenes involved Minny Jackson, and a particular chocolate pie.
B004XNPQUO|3.0|The game is a pretty average game.  It's fun in short spurts, but after about 15 minutes I'm ready to move on to something else.<br /><br />The problem I have with it, and what I think keeps it from being a \\"good\\" game, is that it seems very hit and miss.  I know that trial and error is a part of games like this, but this one seems to use it more so than others.  It's very difficult to figure out what direction and speed you're supposed to shoot the rockets, so inevitably I just end up firing a bunch to get a \\"feel\\" for the level.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just not very good at it.<br /><br />Either way, it's fairly enjoyable and works well.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well, where to start with what has been one of the most controversial books that has been recently published. First, I think I want to put the \\"experts\\" opinions to rest.....this book is beautiful, erotic, heart-warming, loving. It's a beautifully written love story with a side of kink. The title and book cover are so apropos to the story. Ms. James wove a wonderful story about two people who are totally opposite; whose lives could not have been further apart. A chance meeting brings them together. Now, they have to find the middle ground where both of them could be happy and find the place where each could be satisfied, sexually and emotionally. The journey through their lives is intriguing, frustrating, and, I fell madly in love with both Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. My heart broke and I cried at the end of book one.....immediately started on Fifty Shades Darker.<br /><br />Secondly, I really need to comment on the \\"Twilight\\" parallel that has also been the talk. Yes, there are similarities....you would only know them IF you read the Twilight Saga. Where are they? Anastasia leaves her newly-married mother to live with and take care of her father. Christian is dark to Anastasia's light. Christian is filthy rich and Anastasia is just getting buy. He buys her expensive gifts, she tries to refuse them. We could compare this to any number of books that are in bookstores now. Not only Twilight. The differences? Well, we'll start with the BDSM lifestyle (which, I guess, is supposed to be parallel to Edward being a Vampire) and end with Anastasia refusing the hard-core M/s relationship; wanting \\"more\\" (Bella, from the beginning, wanted the dark side). Where will everything lead? I guess you'll have to read the reviews for Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. Oh, by the way, I didn't know the parallel to Twilight until I was half-way through the book. A friend told me about how this came about. Yes, I laughed out loud. Similarities, yes, but every book has similarities, don't they? Two people meet, Two people fall in love.......it's the journey that makes them different.<br /><br />Christian and Anastasia are no different than any couple. They meet; there is electricity between them; they try to fight it; they loose. Christian warns her away from him but he can't stay away. He's filthy-rich and she just graduated from college. He takes her to his home after she goes on a drunken stupor and the rest is, as they say, history. Oh, but what history these two are making with each other. Christian doesn't do \\"boyfriend\\" - until he meets her father and is introduced as such. Christian doesn't do \\"boyfriend\\" - until he takes her home for a family dinner. Christian has never been photographed with a woman - until Anastasia. Christian never sleeps with anyone - until Anastasia. Mr. Grey NEVER does \\"Vanilla Sex\\" - until Anastasia. My how the mighty fall when the right woman is involved. The e-mail banter between Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele is fun and the innuendo's are hysterical. I loved it when he signed his e-mails \\"Christian Grey, Two Palms Twitching CEO, Grey Enterprises, Holdings, Inc.\\" Her reaction to the contract that he presents her are wonderful. You could feel her outrage when he puts in writing exactly what the M/s relationship will involve, right down to what food she will eat. There are two scenes in \\"The Red Room of Pain\\" that are wonderfully written and extremely erotic. It is so hard to review this book without spoilers. There is so much more going on between them and so much more than the M/s relationship that is coming between them.<br /><br />I mention, in the beginning, how apt the title and cover are to this book. Christian will make your head spin with his moods. He's compelling, angry, amusing, loving, protective, mysterious, nasty, and oh so sexy, all in one paragraph. Yes, definitely 50 Shades. Now, anyone who has read any kind of BDSM will know how the Grey Tie that is on the cover of the book would TIE (pun intended) into this story. Yes, it's the first tie that he uses to bind Anastasia up the first time. And, it's the tie that he wears to her college graduation. Much to her horror.<br /><br />I know that there has been a lot of controversy surrounding this book. I really don't understand why. I have been told that certain experts have called people who read this book \\"depraved\\" and have totally bashed the BDSM lifestyle. Well, that's just what it is - a lifestyle. No, I have never been in an M/s relationship, nor have I ever had a manage, or a f/f relationship. I am very Vanilla. But, just because I read books that include masters, slaves, submissives, gay relationships, menage's, doesn't mean that I am depraved. I have also read about Vampires, Werewolves, Mystical people and cowboys. I love romance and absolutely love erotic romance. And, that is just what this book is. Yes, I cried at the end of Book 1. It broke my heart when Anastasia walked out on Christian. I silently begged for them to give each other a chance.

B0024FADDI|5.0|Because I've owned a VHS/DVD player, I didn't need to worry about upgrading my Evil Dead collection until very recently.  So, I did experience some confusion and even conflict when I discovered I had to choose between the Screwhead edition and the Boomstick edition.  I DID manage to find a website that contrasted them and I made my choice that way, after educating myself, but...COME ON!  There needs to be a DVD version that takes all the best of all the versions and compiles it into a single DVD.  Hardest decision I've had to make all year, damn it!  Oh, the pressure! And I'm pretty sure this situation aged me.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Having been a fan of the original set of movies (and everything else PotA) I had been waiting for this to release for as long as I can remember.<br /><br />Let me just make this quick.  It was worth the wait.<br /><br />\\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" succeeds on so many levels that I didn't really expect it to.  Not only is it visually stunning, the writing, acting, and everything else about it are simply breathtaking.<br /><br />If you like great movies, don't miss this one.  And if you're a fan of the series, this one packs some relations to the original movies that fans will instantly recognize.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0071MV540|4.0|I rented \\"Tower Heist\\" to watch on my Kindle Fire on a recent flight while going on vacation.<br /><br />I found the movie to be entertaining, but not spectacular.<br /><br />Ben Stiller was a pretty typical Ben Stiller, which is a good thing.  He makes movies that seem fun, and this movie fit that bill.<br /><br />The problem that I had that kind of keeps the movie from a Five Star rating is that the movie doesn't seem to have much of an identity.  It tries to be a heist movie, but it also tries to be a comedy.  I found that it didn't excel at either, but was good as both.<br /><br />For instance, as a heist movie it's nowhere close to other heist movies out there, and as a comedy movie it's nowhere close to contemporary comedies.<br /><br />Overall, though, I enjoyed the movie.  It's worth a couple of bucks to rent.
B006ZEDZNY|3.0|I think that Depp is an usually an entertaining actor and I think he proves it in this film. But the film lacks an ending. I'm not sure that it's worth the Instant video price of $1.99 that I paid, but oh well. The girl is very pretty, as is the corvette.
B0027ZEHGO|5.0|Don't be put off by the title; there's a lot more to it than what the unfortunate title implies. It gives some detail of the conditions in the US of A for people that don't (as well as those that do) have private or public medical insurance.<br /><br />It also gives overviews of health insurance in other countries, such as Cuba, the UK, and some countries in Europe.<br /><br />Moreover, it describes other very much related issues, such as the level of awareness of the US of American public, the scourge of private corporation dominance, and unpublicized leadership of highly conscious (and conscientious) individuals. This information is included in interviews with these individuals in the DVD Extra submenu of the main menu. \\"Conscientious\\" is not meant to mean anti-capitalism here, though of course conscientiousness has become rather absent from what capitalism has become in these \\"modern\\" times.<br /><br />I was at first sceptical of purchasing this DVD because of its title, but am so impressed with it that I've bought a whole lot, to be delivered to various friends and acquaintances.<br />______________________________

Well she's pregnant, using that as an excuse not to join our Neighbor Watch program, but anyway her son Carl is always out alone playing with those monsters down the block and I just think you should check on this child before he winds up dead.\\"<br /><br />----------  THE GOOD NEWS -------------------------------------<br /><br />Yes, the ending included all the zombies that should have been filtered into other episodes.<br /><br />Yes, finally some action that should have occurred mid-season instead of the dry filler and horrible dialog fans were forced to endure. That farm should have been set on fire 7 episodes ago.<br /><br />Yes, finally a real bad arse character from the comic book arrived and hopefully they don't dumb her down. She's smart enough to carry around two zombies (safely, read the comic book on how and why). And guess what -- she's from the hood [but probably actually knows where her children are]. YES!!!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Where are all the GCB's when you need 'em? Those Texan christian women would have been locked and loaded day one. Lori is useless.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|An elegant memoir-style book showing how one may not have to be taught to feel love but definitely may need to be taught HOW to show love and be loved.  The effects of unsuccessful foster care are heart breaking. Although a condition for the protagonist is never discussed, it screams of Radical Attachment Disorder.  I love the way the author shows that no matter how old you get, there is a child in all of us whose injuries affect our present lives.  And the meanings of flowers discussed throughout and shared at the end...oh!  a whole new world of symbolism has opened up for me as a reader!  Read and enjoy.

In addition, the purchase was easy, the download was simple, fast and having a cloud for backup was also the best choice.<br /><br />I am very happy for this choice and believe me, for me to leave a review is evidence of the same. I don't waste time leaving reviews, unless there is value behind them. No doubt, Adele 21 has great songs and her voice is unique, clear, passionate and leaves you with wanting more...

B006T3RM08|1.0|So maybe the designers over at Henge Docks need to enlighten me, but I bought 2 of these thinking they would be great to keep my magic trackpad and keyboard together, what I got did not live up to expectations. I say this with sadness in my heart because I was really hoping that this was the solution I was looking for. I had plans to be able to sit on my couch and use my flat screen with my MBP.<br /><br />Let me explain...<br /><br />The idea is a great one, but the problem is the click functionality of the Magic trackpad base, it does not work when sitting in the Clique. Or rather it works once and then is stuck in that position. Maybe I am missing something, like a set of instructions that address this issue, but sadly there were none in the wonderful packaging that this item came in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, looks are not able to overcome this design flaw and I will be returning said item unless I can get a major assist from the good people at Henge Docks.<br /><br />Changing to the tap function is not useful as the other functions change and dragging and dropping is easiest with the click feature of the trackpad. Love the trackpad the way it is, why should I change my habits to conform to a poorly designed product.... Work-arounds are not what most people are looking for, and being up front would hurt sales. This is not an expensive item and most people will not return because it is inconvenient. I don't have a vendetta against the Henge Docks, but I do read reviews when shopping and like them to be accurate.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT based on the review of someone that works for the company with cheery things to say about everything the company does, especially when the reviewer discredits the other reviewers that have had real experiences that were less than rosy.<br /><br />Just keeping things real, I wanted to love this product but it did not live up to expectations

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Forget what you believe about the ties that bind family and be prepared to wonder if those who populate your life are really who you think they are, and you will have the crux of William Landay's riveting novel Defending Jacob.<br /><br />To say that this is a heart-wrenching story understates the high emotional toll that events take as they play out in the story of one family's drama. Jacob is the teenage son of Andy Barber, a local district attorney in the tony suburb of Newton, MA, who is charged with the murder of his classmate.<br /><br />Despite protestations of innocence, the community quickly abandons the Barbers. As the family mounts a defense and deals with this new world into which they've been thrust, we are privy to the tiny fissures that threaten to turn into gaping holes in the fabric of their lives. Two stories, ultimately sad parallels, are intertwined through the testimony of a trial. They reveal the hold that blood can have on one's choices and future.<br /><br />In a voice that is at once determined and devastated, Andy recounts the details of the build up towards his son's trial and the monumental changes every relationship he has undergoes as a result of the charge. He laments that a 'not guilty' verdict doesn't remove the stain of assumed guilt from Jacob or the rest of the family.<br /><br />Poignantly threaded throughout, Laurie Barber, the beleaguered wife and mother, grapples with the role she has played, must play currently and will play in the future. She asks the unthinkable questions, thereby providing the foil to Andy's unquestioning devotion.<br /><br />The gritty discourse moves the story along briskly through plot twists and turns that seem like they've been lifted from today's reality television. Characters are the vehicles through which the story is conveyed. Major and minor roles offer depth to the proceedings and present the unspoken readers' perspective. Simultaneously they move as the situation demands and answer our queriesas they erupt.<br /><br />Andy's voice is the common and mostly calm water in which the expository elements float. His deposition-like dialogue speaks to his profession and his perfunctory approach to achieving his son's exoneration. It's his steady pacing that leaves you unprepared for the shocking dénouement. This voice was especially powerful in the unabridged audio book. I listened to the entire book in a single day, so compelling was the performance.<br /><br />This collision of secrets, sensations and saga brew together and form the perfect overflow of tragedy. Ultimately, Defending Jacob confirms that love can drive us to protect in ways that are inconceivably sorrowful. It is a modern day lesson in the perils of believing we know what may actually be unknowable.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|I remember the hype when Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy first became popular, so I was a bit surprised to see David Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo perform somewhat badly in theaters. Did it underperform because the 2009 Swedish version satisfied people's desire to see the series on the big screen, or are people just tired of the whole thing?<br /><br />Before I talk about the movie, I have to mention the opening title sequence. It's just stunning. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adapt Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song and give it a more modern feel. It perfectly sets the mood for what is to come.<br /><br />The story initially focuses on journalist Michael Blomkvist (Craig). We see him lose a libel case and most of his money in the process. He receives an offer from Henrik Vanger (Plummer) who offers to double his salary if he'll investigate who killed his granddaughter, Harriet. Blomkvist feels that he can't do the work alone and so he enlists the help of Lisbeth Salander (Mara), who was hired by one of Vanger's employees to investigate Blomkvist before the offer was made.<br /><br />It's here that the movie differs from the usual offerings within the crime investigation genre. The reason is Salander. She's easily the most interesting character in the story and is highly unconventional. She's considered unstable and perhaps insane and is monitored by a legal guardian. She's covered in piercings and tattoos and refuses to display any social skills whatsoever. Salander is deeply troubled and extremely hard to like when we first meet her.<br /><br />The movie isn't for everyone. It features a rape scene and another in which Salander is forced to perform sexual favors. Other scenes show torture, a dismembered animal and unpleasant photographs of murdered women.<br /><br />The story itself is a fairly straightforward search for the person who killed Harriet. We quickly learn that she wasn't the only victim. Salander has an eidetic memory and a gift for hacking into people's computers, while Blomkvist investigates in a more conventional way. They actually make a good team.<br /><br />The suspects are the other members of Henrik Vanger's extended family, so that's where the investigation begins. The running time is a little over two-and-a-half hours and it does lack momentum at times, but it was gripping enough to hold my interest throughout. Don't expect a huge amount of action, although the final act does include a few thrills.<br /><br />Many will compare Fincher's version to the Swedish version released in 2009. I own both and the difference between the two is minimal. There's slightly more urgency to the original version and it seems raw in comparison to Fincher's polished version. It's tricky buying into certain characters when the actor is known for other roles, and Craig's presence will remind most viewers of his role as James Bond. Indeed, he takes some events in stride as though they happen to him every day.<br /><br />The movie's appearance is somewhat bleak. The wintry scenes consist of a muted color palette with blacks, whites and grays dominating. The Blu-ray looks and sounds wonderful, and it's apparent that this version had a much bigger budget than the Swedish version.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the books, you'll likely be very happy with Fincher's adaptation. Mara was convincing as Salander and it's good to see how her character develops throughout the movie. She's slow to trust anyone, and that's understandable given what we know about her life and recent experiences. When someone does earn her trust, she's loyal and is somebody that you would want to be on your side.<br /><br />I enjoyed this first installment of the Millennium Trilogy, but it could have been better. Although box office numbers were mediocre at best, I think we'll eventually see the other two installments. Will Fincher direct? That remains to be seen.or hacking into people's computers, while Blomkvist investigates in a more conventional way.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I watched this show a few times when there was nothing else on and I thought it was ok, but then it started to intrigue me. I like the Twin Peaks aspect of it and there also is a bit of Northern Exposure's influence too. Some have said that Emily Rose seemed wooden at first. I thought more that she acting like any person would in a new town: cautious and subdued. Small towns are tough to move in to and get acceptance...so that's what I thought she was doing with her character. At first the episodes were kind of \\"well, whats weird this week, but about midseason they really started to throw things at us about the Troubles and Audrey's past and then things REALLY got interesting...for instance the enigmatic tatoo on Duke. I am really looking forward to buying next season and so is my wife. I can't wait for season two to be out on dvd and I hope the execs use their brains and don't pull a Firefly on us and cancel series three. I would be so pissed!

B003ZHR6RK|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption sits at the top of the IMDB Top 250 with a rating of 9.2/10, so it clearly appeals to the majority of those who have seen it. It's also hated by some because they can't agree that it's the best film ever made. While I understand that argument, I find it difficult to believe that the haters can't respect it on some level. However, I don't care about any of that, I love the film.<br /><br />The story begins in 1946 with the trial of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) and we see him convicted for murdering his wife and her lover. The next 30 minutes shows him arriving at the prison and slowly adapting to life behind bars. Darabont uses a number of violent scenes to establish that prison life is somewhat brutal, but he doesn't dwell on it as the film progresses.<br /><br />This is a film about hope and friendship more than anything else. It just happens to be set in a prison. Andy befriends Red (Freeman), because he's a man who knows how to obtain items from the outside world. Their friendship and mutual respect is there from the start and develops throughout the film.<br /><br />Andy is an educated man and he finally attracts the attention of the most brutal prison guard in a memorable rooftop scene. The guard has inherited some money and fears that the IRS will take a big chunk. Andy shows him a way to avoid losing any of it. That single event is the catalyst for significant change in Andy's life. The guards begin to protect him and he's given a job which enables him to use some of his knowledge. He's well-liked by both the inmates and the guards.<br /><br />Warden Norton (Gunton) is one of the most corrupt men in Shawshank, even though he runs the place. He seems fairly harmless, but he's actually evil, greedy and dangerous. He provides the main source of conflict in the film.<br /><br />Andy strives to improve prison life for everyone, as evidenced by his campaign to win funding for the library. He makes the best of his situation at all times.<br /><br />The final 30 minutes of the film is extremely uplifting. Stephen King wrote the short story on which the film is based and his influence can clearly be seen. One of the things I like about King is the sense of justice present in his stories. If you think back to The Green Mile, you'll see what I mean. The Shawshank Redemption covers 20 years of Andy's life. Darabont wanted the final scene to be omitted, but the conclusion is still incredible.<br /><br />In the 18 years since the film was made, you've probably heard dozens of Morgan Freeman voice-overs. If you watch the film, you'll see why.<br /><br />One of the themes present in the film is how inmates can become institutionalized. Imagine being in prison for 50 years. How would things have changed in the outside world? It would be bad enough missing 20 years. Think about the advances made since the early 1990s. If you stepped out of a prison cell after 20 years, wouldn't you wonder why everyone walked around talking into their cellphones? You might light a cigarette and be arrested.<br /><br />I would recommend The Shawshank Redemption to anyone. You might not like it, but there's a strong chance you will. Robbins and Freeman are both superb. I watch the film twice a year and never tire of seeing it./>The final 30 minutes of the film is extremely uplifting.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I really wasn't sure about buying this. You know, there were no particular known actors and quite frankly I don't trust prequels or sequels. BUT, this is one taut movie. The writing is excellent, and contrary to some of the other reviewers there are no areas of loose plot. I love the monster. It really shows the influence of HP Lovecraft on modern film. The creepiest part concerns the female Norwegian doctor. I loved the short story, loved the original, loved Carpenter's remake and love this one. It is great the way they took great pains to make sure the 1982 film segued into this one. People say the movie leaves us hanging, but I don't agree with that. We wouldn't be here if she hadn't reached safety. By the way, I stick by this review, even though some people seem to hate the movie. I truly enjoyed it and heartily recommend it.

0062082353|2.0|No one would dare question the bravery of US Navy SEALs, nor would anyone have reason to argue that their training isn't extremely difficult and challenging.<br /><br />But Kyle's sophomoric use of profanity to prove that he's tough got old after the first few pages of the book. I once saw the following in an Irish pub:  \\"Cursing makes ignorance audible.\\"  It's a shame Kyle never saw that.<br /><br />As a 23-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, I expected a military book when I bought this. Instead I got an account of bar brawls interspersed with poorly written tales of Kyle taking some sniper shots. His childish, beer-fueled actions while off duty disgrace the uniform.<br /><br />No one likes war, but Kyle claims he does. I guess that was yet another attempt to prove that he's a bada**. Ask any soldier if he or she would like the war to be over so they could go home. I doubt that you'd find many who'd tell you that they wish it would continue because they're enjoying it so much.<br /><br />How this book got to the top of the NY Times best-seller list is a mystery.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a very well put together story of a SEAL and his four deployments to Iraq. Numbers aside (of his kills) the number doesn't matter, the story moves along and gives you a feel of what it is like to be there and gives you a look at his mind set. What is of equal value are the parts of the book pertaining to his wife (that she wrote); the person often overlooked in these stories. This gives you a look at his personal life and the toll it took on him, his wife, and the rest of his family. A great read, plenty of action; look forward to seeing this on the big screen and I wish Chris and his family all the best moving forward into the future.<br /><br />I would also recommend as an additional book Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell.

I somehow expected more though; it is an interesting premise and a well written story, but the author could have done much more with it. It was more just kind of fluffy, I never really connected with the characters. I would give the first 80% of the book 4 stars (as an easy beach read, not as a general good book), but the last 20% was just too weird for me. The book lost at least a star, in my opinion, for a rather tortured, odd and disappointing ending.

B007M6P01O|4.0|Munch...Munch...Munch....Great Ending to the Second Season..and I am sure the suits at AMC are happy with the Ratings Numbers...Some fans (Me included) should familiarize ourselves with the rich material (as the comic book series spans a vast number of years) because as you saw with the Dark Hooded Figure who had the two Walkers on a Chain the series has only scratched the surface of the cast of characters the creators can throw our way...<br /><br />Do I miss Shane...yes...but this Roller Coaster as not reached the top yet and it was time to introduce a new devil or two...yes I wish we could have kept Dale around..who will be the new Moral Conscience...Ricks little boy and wife will continue to take turns being antagonists in so many different ways...<br /><br />The show is structured to keep us guessing...continuously...I knew Andrea was bad enough to survive...but to be rescued by an even tougher female (the hooded figure from the comic book series)says a lot about the depth of creativity for the series.<br /><br />I think Shane's version of the \\"infection\\" was helping to drive him crazy...so Rick should step back and not feel so bad about what went down and the rest of the group should realize the same...there group has value..splitting up would not be smart.<br /><br />The helicopter gives us hope that all is not lost and the introduction of a new character tells us that the Walking Dead really has legs.

What I did not like was the ending, but I will not elaborate much on that for those who have not read the book yet.  It doesn't ruin the book or the story, it may be just me, but it left me wanting more.

0741470314|5.0|When I was first asked by the author and a certain book site if I would like to do a complimentary read and review or a book on Michael Jackson, my reaction was: 'Will anyone even refuse?\\" I mean, it's a book on MJ..Who on Earth can say No to that? And I am so glad I went on to read this gem of a book...Trust me, this is ONE of those books that you HAVE to read.<br /><br />Even if you have till date managed to remain a non-fan of MJ the artist, the reading and subsequent understanding of MJ the man ll make you an instant fan.<br /><br />I've always been a huge fan of MJ - I love the fact that he was a self-made man, a little boy who worked hard from the age of five in the glare of flashlights and the media, always the performer, trying hard and working harder to give his family a better life, who made it his passion to see to it that the message of love and peace was shared across the globe in the best way that he could - through his music and his compassion.<br /><br />So when I began reading, it was an emotional roller coaster ride for me. I must, in the very beginning, give full credit to the author, Dr. Karen Moriarty, for her detailed research and for being able to provide more than enough proof against all those allegations that MJ has faced throughout his life.<br /><br />The MJ we saw was the MJ that the media portrayed to us. The MJ who lives in the pages of this book is the real MJ - a father whose only world was his three children, an unconditional giver of love and support, a man with a golden heart who always kept his home, his property, his finances open for all those needy children and their parents who would benefit from some help or other - the soul of a small, innocent boy trapped in the body of an adult man.<br /><br />Rumour after rumour, author goes on to describe how Michael's insecurities and acts of kindness have been turned into a media circus day after day:<br />The biggest fear that Michael had was not being able to protect his children. And it was because of this that he went to unfathomable lengths to keep them shielded from the media, from the world. He kept them in veils, he always kept a large amount of cash in his bedroom, in case he ever needed to pay a ransom and the bank happened to be closed. The media made a spectacle of this 'veiling' and labeled him a 'whacko.'<br />Not many were aware that Michael suffered from a skin condition that caused his skin to pigment, and that he was medically required to stay away from sunlight. Hence the umbrella, which fueled a lot of criticism in the media.<br />When Michael donated a chamber to a children's ward in a hospital he wanted to check for himself how it worked, and the next day the media splashed pictures of him, claiming Michael used a special oxygen chamber for himself to maintain his looks.<br />From the age of 5, Michael had always been surrounded by bodyguards and had people work on his accounts. He never got a chance to handle things on his own. This led to a dependency on others. But those around him were not as honest as they led Michael to believe, and as the author also sadly realised, people stole from him left, right and center - not only outsiders, family members too!<br />The staff at his ranch Neverland was instructed to permanently give free access to sick children and their parents to his own home there, his kitchen, his property and any  place they wished for. They stayed for weeks, months, all on MJ's money. And later, when they recovered and were asked to leave, they filed lawsuits, claiming compensation.<br /><br />The worst mistake Michael did was to never speak out. Being intensely private, he believed if he would only give people what they asked for, the problems would be over. But this only brought on more trouble. Michael faced upto 50 lawsuits a per week throughout his life! And he paid them all! Without ever being proven guilty!<br /><br />Michael was so affected by the sad plight of children that he was repeatedly scared of reading the papers or switching on the TV, so that he did not stumble across a picture of a hurt child. Everywhere he toured in any part of the world, he made it a point to visit one place where needy children would benefit and make donations for them. Even on his last day, after Dr. Conrad Murray gave him the doses that was to bring an end to this great man, Michael, in his dazed state, was speaking of his final dream, of making the Michael Jackson Children's Hospital, which would be the biggest and the best in the world.<br /><br />The bodyguards who were with Michael 24*7 remember him as being the kindest and most soft-spoken person they have ever met. They remember him with a love that is rare. They share details that will bring tears to anyone who reads of those times that Michael yearned for love, understanding and appreciation from the world.<br /><br />It's a shame what we did to him. Each rumour, each fact, each gesture can only make you cry and want to reach out to this purest of pure souls envelop him in a hug. If only we had been a little human towards him. What a shame on us all!

B002BWP49C|4.0|Well, of course this had what I was looking for - the movie. But, it was missing something I was expecting - scenes that were cut out. In the first three films, they were there, but in this one, they chose to do something I consider stupid.<br /><br />Instead of tons of wonderful extras, you can choose to be an Edward or Jake fan and it will fast-forward through the movie to the parts that character are in. If I wanted to do that, I could have done it myself.<br /><br />Give us the deleted scenes!
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|This movie didn't entertain anyone of any age for even minutes. It is a boring embarrassment to all penguins everywhere!
B005OIAKB2|5.0|This is the band's most recent album, and it shows. Pretty much everything they've been doing from the get go, just better. No serious deviations in style, but continuing to perfect their craft. That being said, if you're not a fan of any of their previous work, it's rather doubtful you'll find anything you like here either.
B005BQTUVI|3.0|I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie.<br /><br />A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners.<br /><br />Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it.<br /><br />Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been.<br /><br />The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on.<br /><br />A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.<br /><br />The Blu Ray presents the film in wonderfully icky 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair assortment of good extras.tion is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on.<br /><br />A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this app a lot because it tells all the weather &amp; pollen count! And, you can also set a tone to notify you if there's aa high pollen count! Nice!! &lt;3 this app!
B005FITIK0|4.0|Had mixed feelings during the movie. For some reason I was expecting a romantic comedy, but I should have read more about it before watching, I guess. Thought the characters seemed pretty realistic and human. They all had their good points and bad points. I was really against Mavis in the beginning, but I thought her character was real and honest. I liked her more, in a sympathetic way, once I realized why she did what she did. Took me a few hours after the movie was over to realize I really liked it and would definitely recommend the time spent to watch it.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I am amazed at how childish the average review.  Most people review subjectively and unfairly skew the ratings.  This app does exactly what the author states and does it beautifully and well.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This was an extraordinary production, beautifully sung, danced and acted.  It was a stage production but with closeups so that it not only seemed like you were attending the performance but also that you were actually there with the performers. All the principals were wonderful, not to mention fine actors in the closeups and seemed to be so in love with the story. I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I've watched it four times and loved it every time. I originally bought the Hollywood version some years ago. Talk about people missing the point. It is a story of a deformed man with a beautiful voice, so the got a handsome actor couldn't sing for the part. It broke my heart and I watched it once and never again.  This is everything that should have been and more. I recommend it wholeheatedly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for keeping kids buisy.  my kids ages 5 and 7 love the ease of the games and how many there are.
B006UG909U|3.0|It's obvious what's missing here...Michael Anthony's backing vocals and bass playing.  I would buy this CD and buy tickets for the tour had it been the original line up.  An example of nepotism at its worse imo.  Nothing against Wolfgang, he's a decent bass player.  Michael Anthony's backing vocals are the best in the business though and they're a big contributor to VH's sound.  Had they used the original bass player and better production his would be a 4 or 5 star CD.

B001QWBM62|5.0|Four channel, dual stereo means you can record in surround sound, if you really want to! How cool is that?! I can't beat it. I am not disappointed with this purchase, because it does so many different things. I can record from the built-in mics AND have my shotgun mic attached to the XLR ports. This thing does it all; 3.5mm or XLR. It has a port for headphones, to hear it live. It record amazingly well!
B005KELR3A|1.0|For the most part, this cover is nice, but on occasion, the little devil turns my Kindle on!<br /><br />I have to leave the upper corner of the case open to check to see if my Kindle got turned on after I slip it in the sleeve. This doesn't happen every time, but often enough that I check each and every time.<br /><br />I think this happens because the case is 'just' big enough for the Kindle to slip in, and, it doesn't take much pressure on the start button to turn the Kindle on. The stinker about this is that it has run the battery down on me!<br /><br />I'm just going to use this one until I sew up another one out of some extra quilted fabric I have, then toss it, as it's not worth the cost of postage to send it back.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I enjoy this series very much (although, quite frankly I prefer Hell on Wheels, Mad Men and Breaking Bad). I am troubled by several aspects of the series, though. First, vast majority of the female characters are relegated to traditional \\"homemaking\\" roles even though we all know the rules have changed and will change more drastically in the type of world encountered in The Walking Dead. I  would love to see a female character portrayed as a leader who is capable of doing something more important than the damn laundry!<br /><br />Second, indoor plumbing (unless using a well system) and electrical power would no longer be available. Obviously, these modern conveniences would shut down within an extremely short period of time since there is no one alive to service these utilities.<br /><br />Finally, instead of constantly dealing with an old motor home which breaks down frequently, anyone with half a brain would simply commandeer a new and updated motor home. Surely they could have found one in the Atlanta area!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I've been using the Weather Channel app on my Kindle Fire and I've found it very useful.  It provides such a wealth of information.  I can store multiple locations.  It gives me current, hourly, 36 hour, or ten-day forecasts.  It has options for severe weather alerts and pollen alerts.  I can browse maps of the area.  It is very well-organized, very easy to navigate.  I think the only thing missing is a time clock for each area.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Its a perfect view of an imperfect world.... That is constantly revealed to you....I, just like everyone else, want the rest and/or more....that's it. Just like the characters, sleep begins to become a negotiable commodity..... Until you're finished with the task at hand.<br /><br />How & when? By whom? Phenomenal<br /><br />Well done brother.... Just get the Omnibus, you'll thank me & Hugh later.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I absolutely love Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway and this movie made me laugh quite a bit.  I would have loved to have an MOVIE insert along with the DVD.<br />This item came super fast and was surprised when I found it in my mailbox so soon.
0345528581|4.0|Amazing book for someone who hates going to the gym and much rather do their exercise and privacy of their home but without the physical buzz and challenge. Written by a former military/marine/navy trainer - I think I'm gonna listen to this guy.<br /><br />I've read the whole book first before I embark on the '10 Week Programs' that is outlined in the book. There's 4 variations of that program, all suited for all levels of fitness and where you are coming from. Just for kicks I tried out the beginners level - but I kid you not this alone can kick your ass. But don't be hesitant and say \\" I can't do these exercises .. \\". The book presents variations on the bodyweight movement/exercises that you can start with. Eventually you will build strength and progress into something more complex. Some tips on nutrition were outlined in the book as well - but as in any tip or info given, it should be taken with a grain of salt. Any further info regarding nutrition should be researched further and be advised by your physician and a nutrition pro.<br /><br />As a disclaimer - results do vary. But in my case I have suggested this to my brother and sister. They both found it interesting and helpful (results soon may follow) and will be posted as another review. For now I have done the 2nd level of the variation for the '10 week programme'. Twice. And now I'm experimenting on the exercises given in the book. It's great to have some sort of variety as it keeps me engaged and interested which is a massive thing for most of the public in sticking with a 'health and fitness goals'.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to eliminate the gym in the whole picture of staying healthy. As a general idea, being in a state of 'health' should be defined by a professional and by you. There's also a massive community support for the book and websites that adhere to the same principles of this book.<br /><br />It's up to you to take the first step.
B002V092M4|3.0|I needed to read this novel after seeing the movie.  It filled in a few gaps that confused me in the movie and I enjoyed reading it despite knowing the gist of the story.  I thought this novel was too expensive for an older title and balked at the price initially.  I felt compromised but I wanted to see what, if anything, was missing from the screenplay.  In the end I had to pay the price.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|The app has nice layout and features, but for some reason none of the widgets will show up on my home screen. I drag and drop as I would any widget, but they don't keep.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|enjoying playing the games. some are a bit difficult but like earning new games. free app for kindle fire too.
B0027REDK2|5.0|This thorough two-cd collection shows off what many fans of Rio have been clamoring for for many years now. My favorites are:<br /><br />Hungry Like The Wolf - night version<br /><br />  - This one blows the other two versions out of the water. It contains the extended intro and the mix is very clean with the keyboards and bass out front and even with the electric guitar track. This is the one with Taylor's \\"slap bass\\" track slightly louder in the mix. The U.S. re-mix contains a strange off-beat drum in the mix at the beginning that actually sounds like a production mistake. On the UK version, the keyboards and bass are too subdued and bland sounding.<br /><br />My Own Way - original UK mix<br /><br />  - On Carnival, this song was turned into a 1978 sounding disco mix that unfortunately doesn't sound much like new-wave rock.<br /><br />Rio - original UK mix and night version<br /><br />  - The U.S. re-mix of this song was, I feel, unfortunately a miss-step. While on Hungry Like The Wolf the clarity of the keyboards is a plus (night version), on the song Rio it is a minus. The keyboard tracks that are subdued in the UK mix on this one sound better that way, i.e. not brought out front in the mix. As an American I know I am in the minority here when it comes to this particular song, but the album rock station here back in the day played the UK version, so that's what I was always used to hearing. Here is something to ponder: which mix was used on the shortened 45 rpm record single? Did the single version also have alternate mixes, depending on the country of release?<br /><br />Hold Back The Rain - Carnival version<br /><br />  - The original UK version also sounds great, but I prefer the longest variation in this case. Again, like Rio, less keyboards sound better on this one. The U.S. re-mix has some extra keyboard tracks.<br /><br />Looks like this gem of a cd has gone out of print! :(
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great case. It's light and fits the Kindle Fire perfectly.  It's slim and fits right in the side of my purse.  Also the the stand is awesome. Frees up your hands and lifts the Kindle just right. It's sturdy and I hope it holds up over time. I've only had mine a few days, but I'm enjoying not having to hold my Kindle all the time.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Great Movie for all that is, yes, profund but yet so simple and brings us back to what really matters: Love, Friendship, Unity, Courage, True Leadership, in the midst of difficulties, trials, and hardship.  Goes back to the basics of honesty, honor, and happiness.  Eric put is so well when he sang, \\"...Pretty Lies...\\" are those empty promises and pacts.  It gives us a little insight as to how important parenting is and relationships with sons and daughters are, as well as how much they are greatly needed. We need examples worhty of being followed and honored. I can see why there was so many one stars...maybe we are too used to seeing movies that entertain, but yet have no significant values or principles that are so real and down to earth.  As shown in the movie, even the little things can be so significant.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I purchased a Xbox 360 in December 2007. After 42 months, I finally bought a PS3.<br /><br />I have not touched my Xbox ever since. One reason is that the Dualshock 3 is more comfortable to hold. There's no cramping or sweating while holding this controller.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I loved the books, but would have liked to know where in each book I was. Since all three books were considered to be one book, when I was reading it on my kindle, I did not know how far I was through each book. I would consider buying each book individually next time. The actual books were exciting and easy to read. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|GREAT CD - great price !!!!  Fast service, and good condition.  I get all of my CDs from Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great way to pass time. The ads are annoying, but it is a free app, and you can purchase the app if they really bother you.

B000W93CHC|5.0|this book picks up were the Pillars ends following the same family and area several generations later.  Follet does an amazing job of intigrating fact with fiction
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Before I bought (with hesitation) the book I read some of the reviews, especially the one and two stars. I am happy to say that the book is definitely a very good book, it has a lot of humor in it, and it gives a view of the \\"ambulance chasers\\" (the blue collar lawyers).<br />It is defiantly a \\"lightweight\\" Grisham and I think that Grisham readers would like the book much.
1401937519|5.0|A truly significant milestone in bringing enlightenment to the world; freeing the mind from the bondage of religion, awakening consciousness to the reality of human kind's greatest capabilities, and instilling hope on so many levels.  Not only is this a glimpse into the greater cosmic reality but a wonderful journey inward to the wonders of the self.  This will be THE book of 2012 and Anita's story will enrich millions of lives.
0545265355|5.0|I was skeptical at first about reading these books, as it just didn't seem like something that I was really interested in, I normally veer away from 'young adult' novels.  After a friend basically made me promise to read the first book, I have devoured all three in under two weeks.  They're are an easy read, but it's virtually impossible to stop reading once you start!  Go ahead and buy the trilogy, you're going to end up buying the other two books anyways!
B004XKVPG6|5.0|great movie. i now know whats in the box! cant go wrong with blu ray, not much more to say, i mean its a dvd and it was new no complaints here.
0385535139|5.0|Got sucked in right from the first page. Awesome beginning. Fineley crafted, entertaining story, and niceley tied together with an enjoyable narrative in a very satisfying way. Special treat at the end of the day, but hard to put down. Ready for another one.<br /><br />Read it on my wife's Keyboard Kindle, skeptically at first, and then wtih enthusiasm for the comfort and convenience. It really is a nice way to handle a stack of books you want to read.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|You might have seen in my Kindle Fire review that I'm a huge fan of Amazon's tablet. But as to what case to get- there are so many options.<br /><br />What I was looking for:<br />I wanted a slim case that provides protection as well as a stand function.<br /><br />How it does meeting those requirements:<br /><br />Slimness- it is quite sleek and slim, just as Marware claims. I wanted to add very little thickness to it, as it's already .45\\" thick. With the case, it's about 5/8\\" thick, perfect for reading. I have no problem with thickness because I like to have something to hold on to, not just like a piece of paper.<br /><br />Protection- As a few drop tests on common household surfaces from common heights prove, it does to quite a good job of protecting the device. I am no longer concerned about dropping it.<br /><br />Stand- this is the reason it's only 4 stars. The stand functionality as they intended is to steep for typing, but perfect for watching a video on. However, I'll be typing more than viewing and a steep angle typing?- Forget about it. So what I did was use it kinda like some of the iPad covers do: fold the cover over and tuck it under to make a smaller angle. However, it's unstable that way. So yeah, Marware, just make it like the iPad one. No one's gonna care.<br /><br />Why the stand beats the others: it's much cleaner. Others have fancy beds in which grooves lay and-just look bad. This has a clean look like I wanted.<br /><br />So yes, I think it's the best.
0307959856|3.0|I'm surprised at the pro critics high opinion of this book. I'm a huge Austen fan and P&P is my favourite. I have also read James and enjoy her way with a good murder plot. This book is not particularly good rendition of Austen, nor even a particularly good murder plot. James appears to be trying a Regency era voice, but she doesn't seem to have the way with relationships that Austen did and certainly not the wit. As for the murder plot, there's no real detection to speak of so no real satisfaction comes from the reveal (which feels a little contrived).<br /><br />It's certainly fun to get a bit of 'what if' glimpse into the future of P&P. The reference to characters from Persuasion was surprising and enjoyable, although I missed the Emma reference.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad book, entertaining enough and a quick easy read, but you will not get the best of either Austen or James from it.
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Now this is what Symphonic Metal should be!!  Since Nightwish turned for the worst, and Epica's new album is pretty bad, I'm glad to have discovered this band.  This is a great and powerful album!!  Hopefully they will stay heavy.  \\"Unlike some other bands I know.\\"  5 Stars all the way!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|the idea that history or the world can be changed with one single time in history changed is the premise of the book. and, of course, what about small changes as well as big changes. And how would someone today view life from 50 years ago..I truly enjoyed this
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have lots of fun trying to unlock the other games. Its just like playing Kirby's epic Yarn! Win a level, unlock a level.

B007B6VOG0|4.0|I LOVE the music. It's catchy and makes you move and I really love this guy's voice. But for some reason they felt like they needed to auto tune everything and the further you get into the album the more auto tuning you hear. It makes my heart sad! They just took it a step too far with the auto tuning. Overall, good album. If you like his voice, maybe check out The Format his old group. They're good and humorous :)
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is so good I can honestly say that this one of the best games EVER! Thank you for finally bringing this to android.
0307888908|4.0|In my opinion, this book is well worth the cost. While the themes are the same as we have heard many times - invest in yourself, build your network, etc. - it has some jewels in terms of making good points and it adds more detail about how to do various things. The actual doing is the trick for contemporary career management - not understanding what should be done. For example, I really like his three puzzle piece concept of career building - your assets, your aspirations, and the market realities. Yes, these are certainly typical components of contemporary career management BUT the focus on market realities and how to assess them and the discussion of managing risk is a major update. (For those of you aware of my book, [[ASIN:0275988015 The Mid-Career Success Guide: Planning for the Second Half of Your Working Life]], you know that I think the focus on work contribution is a major change in how careers have to be managed now.) Another plus of this book is their explanation why the traditional career plan is no longer really workable AND what to replace it with (what they call ABZ planning). Again, they go a step further in articulating the how. And finally, there is a really interesting segment on networking which is focused on how to manage your network and how to get it to work for you in assessing your market realities and gathering information on other career-related questions. This could really help people on how to use Linked In or other social networking sites. The book is also quite good in providing a short to-do list at the end of each chapter with some insightful ideas that often provide a somewhat different slant on working through the well known generalities of career management today.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Some people are crazy not to give this book a 5 star rating! Rick Riordan so knows how to keep your eyes glued to the page. It is a perfeact addition to The Lost Hero. Thank school they made us read Percy Jackson and the Lighting Theif, because without them, I would have never got to read The Son of Neptune. But sadly there is something terribly wrong. We have to wait 'till The Mark of Athena to come out! Rick Riordan, your fans, which I am a huge fan, are waiting for you ; )
0307120007|5.0|I received this book very quickly, which was a pleasant surprise for my granddaughter! It was from a reseller, but appeared to be a brand new product, which was a pleasant surprise for me! This reseller is obviously reliable and truthful when describing the products.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|it is a good game. I have played everyday making sure I have cooked stuff. I would recommend it to people who like to run things.
B0078N2MTE|2.0|SPOILER ALERT! I found this film riveting, in tone, performances, right up until the ending, which I felt was a betrayal of everything that went before. It's basically a high toned, naturalistic Twilight Zone episode complete with a \\"gotcha!\\" finale. I would have been happier with a more ambiguous finish.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Considering I just bought this app for my wife's iPad, I am pretty sure this is an Android port from what was originally an iOS application. Since iOS does not have widgets, what the developer is calling \\"widgets\\" are actually the various display items in the UI. This is poor wording considering Android users understand widgets to be something else and the developer probably should have given a different program description rather than cutting-n-pasting his or her iOS description.<br /><br />It should also be noted this same program in iOS is 271 megabytes in size and, on the iPad 2, it's relatively beautiful to look at for a weather app. I'm guessing it is the large variation of backgrounds and weather elements that make this app so large. The animations are lovely and there are a lot of them. Most weather apps have a small handful of very limited animations. Not a big deal. If 46 megabytes freaks you out and makes you think this takes up too much room...you know...because its .046 gigabyte and even your low end handheld probably has 8gb making it...you know...less than 0.5% of your space, then don't download this. Yet, if you are realistic and rational, this isn't a big deal.<br /><br />With regards to accuracy, it should be noted that weather apps...all of them...pull their data from some national weather source. The developer does not have his own weather station and staff of meteorologists on hand (at least it's a safe bet he or she doesn't) and it could be he is using an unreliable source. However, I would venture to guess if you dig hard enough you will find it matches one of the big ones that most other services use.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a very attractive program. It would be 5 stars if it had widgets (in the Android sense of the word) and if you could select your data source in a settings menu.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|This is the least successful of the \\"Thing\\" movies, yet in many ways the most faithful to the source material, \\"Who Goes There?\\" (brilliant title). Yes the CG effects invite less investment than the latex kind, but this version seemed to me to best reflect the vision of the alien in the original story. As lame as Jim Arness' get-up was in the Howard Hawkes version, that film had crackling good dialogue and suspense. The Carpenter version was good, pulpy fun, but I found the creature effects a noisy hodgepodge and sympathized with Kurt Russell's exasperation at the end when he tries to blow it up. This latest version was diverting, but not as endearing as the previous efforts.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|, waste of time. its blatently obvious that every positive review is posted by the developer.  its sad that Amazons free app of the day has become so useless. they used to have fantastic apps, but now it has resorted to this trash.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|Solidly made, cerebral thriller with an almost criminally restrained Gary Oldman. A worthy, but unexciting entry in the espionage genre.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Arrived on time and works great pretty well though the software is a bit awkward...however, it seems to behave pretty well as long as the \\"3D Mouse Home\\" control panel is actually left open and running.
B004LROUNG|2.0|This was very fast reading,but has no import whatsoever.A year from now you won't remember you read it. Although,it is enjoyable as you turn the pages. Very predictable.
1442346949|5.0|This is a great book!!! Steve Jobs had a great mind! It's refreshing to have a writer write the way it is not the way they think it should be.
B004X4QW42|1.0|Spoilers below - you have been warned.<br /><br />I really liked the first Ip Man film and it's a tribute to that movie that I gave this one a chance.  Subtitles are not my thing.  The film begins with Ip Man in Hong Kong trying to establish a martial arts school. He runs into some bad guys and kicks a sizeable amount of @ss.  Everything is looking good - I'm totally on board.  He then has to prove himself to the city's other Kung Fu masters and we get to see the best fight in the movie, where Ip faces off against Master Huang and does some incredible acrobatics as they do battle on top of a giant, wobbly table.  Trust me, it's a great scene.  Neither man actually wins the fight, but it is apparent to me that Master Huang will be the villain of this movie and that's a good thing, because Master Huang is quite awesome even though he's about 60 years old and is running the city's docks using the power of his mighty martial arts militia.<br /><br />But then Ip and Huang learn a life lesson, and respect is shared, and they have some sort of bonding moment going on.  Which is when \\"Twister\\" the English boxer shows up and this film goes straight into the toilet.  Twister appears to be a Middleweight boxer and the most imposing thing about him is that he's sporting a six-pack.  During a public martial arts demonstration Twister challenges an 8-man team and proceeds to WIN.  Color me shocked.  But who knows ... maybe they were all white belts, or something?  After the ruckus dies down, Master Huang defends the honor of Chinese martial arts and steps into the ring.  Let me give some background.  10 minutes ago we just saw Huang throw a rickety chair on top of another rickety chair, then leap 15ft into the air on top of them both, and then somersault onto a wobbly table where he fought Ip Man to a draw.  The same Ip Man that killed 10 Japanese fighters in the first film without breaking too much of a sweat.  To put it bluntly, I'm expecting this fight to last about 3 seconds,the conclusion of which will probably be with Twister's decapitated head rolling down the aisle after Huang puts a foot to the side of his skull, Billy-Jack style.  Well, not so much. Huang gets beaten to death.  Literally.<br /><br />I won't go into any more of the movie.  Twister is awful, and I've seen people walking down the street that could kick his butt.  Your hero can only be as good as your villain and challenging Twister has all the emotional impact of, \\"do we need to buy more toilet paper?\\"  I was so disappointed by the last half of this film that I can't give it more than one star.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|This does work well, but with all the built in technology of programs like Logic Pro and Cakewalk this is becoming obsolete...at least for what I was using it for. I used this to record some demos on my PC and Laptop and I didn't really need it after a while, however when I did have it, it definitely did a good job. I was never able to get the FX knobs working...and maybe that's because I was just learning at the time, but I found that I only needed my USB sound card to record and this just sits on the side until I have more use for it. Maybe it's for use if you have someone else recording you in a small time studio and they need to hear you while you're recording...that's the only use that I could think of for this...anything other than that and it's over kill.
1591843065|4.0|Good read for those looking for a new method to explain difficult concepts.  I intend to use it rigth away.  Make sure you enlarge your whote boards.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I try not to write bad reviews because I realize it's not easy to sit down and write a book, especially one that seems to have gone viral and has everyone talking.  However, this is the worst piece of trash I have ever read.  Putting aside the fact that the writing is horrible, the characters are annoying and the American girl speaks like an uptight Brit, the sex scenes made me cringe.  I like erotic books, but this was nothing like an erotic book.  It was cheesy, trashy, and repulsive.  If this is what's considered good literature nowadays, maybe we need to re-evaluate our tastes.
1400069289|5.0|In this wonderful book, Charles Duhigg, an investigative reporter for The New York Times, tackles an important reality head on. That is, people succeed when they identify patterns that shape their lives--and learn how to change them. This idea--that you can indeed change your habits--draws on recent research in experimental psychology, neurology, and applied psychology.<br /><br />As you can see from the TOC below, Duhigg really goes after a broad range of topics. He looks at the habits of individuals, how habits operate in the brain, how companies use them, and how retailers use habits to manipulate buying habits. This provides some fascinating research and stories, such as the fact that grocery stores put fruits and vegetables at the front of the store because people who put these healthy items in their carts are more apt to buy junk food as well before they leave the store. The author's main contention is that \\"you have the freedom and responsibility\\" to remake your habits. He says \\"the most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager.\\" He makes a convincing case for all this. The only problem is that's all he does. He doesn't show you how to do it.<br /><br />PART ONE: THE HABITS OF INDIVIDUALS<br /><br />1. The Habit Loop - How Habits Work<br />2. The Craving Brain - How to Create New Habits<br />3. The Golden Rule of Habit Change - Why Transformation Occurs<br /><br />PART TWO - THE HABITS OF SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATIONS<br /><br />4. Keystone Habits, or The Ballad of Paul O'Neill - Which Habits Matter Most<br />5. Starbucks and the Habit of Success - When Willpower Becomes Automatic<br />6. The Power of a Crisis - How Leaders Create Habits Through Accident and Design<br />7. How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do - When Companies Predict (and manipulate) Habits<br /><br />PART THREE - THE HABITS OF SOCIETIES<br /><br />8. Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott - How Movements Happen<br />9. The Neurology of Free Will - Are We Responsible for Our Habits?<br /><br />My chief complaint is he doesn't really show you how to break bad habits. For this you should consider [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]. That book was great for my self-control.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been trying to find SOMETHING to lose the belly fat - joining gyms, running, walking, sit ups and keep feeling just in my ab area completely FAT all the time. I had pretty low expectations (never even have seen the biggest loser) but figured why not - I don't need wii, kinect, etc. and just old school dvd.<br /><br />IT IS AWESOME!! goes by so fast, is SO hard, yet you feel GREAT after. In just 5 days I noticed a big difference in energy, metabolism (maybe TMI but previous \\"irregularity\\" is gone) and my belly fat/bloat is looking smaller by the day.<br /><br />This is not easy, I got cocky and went to level 2 after day 1 of level 1 and almost died. : )but you get RESULTS.<br /><br />Jillian ROCKS!
B006YMM64G|2.0|It was over the top sappy, we didn't finish watching it. The acting was poor. I think this is probably a better movie for a religious retreat.. that I would never go on.
0307956350|5.0|I love when a book catches me at the synopsis and doesn't let me go. From start to finish, this book was unperdictable, and suspensful. Definitely a recommendation if you're looking for something to keep your interest and to keep you on your toes.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|This is a solid app, but it's really too large for what it does. I'm pretty sure the size is because of the backgrounds. If you look closely, it looks like the backgrounds are actual HD video loops. I think the Weather, US Radar, Alerts, Quakes app , despite having a horrible name, that was FAOTD a few months ago is far better and I'll stick to using it, thanks.
B0063GORYU|5.0|cool game, hate ads...but it's free! graphics are great.. lots of play options...love that it keeps track of fastest time and least amount if moves...
B001GF7WRW|2.0|I agree with the sentiments that these are fine sounding phones that are neutral in coloration, and the price is good for this quality of sound level.  However, these are among the more uncomfortable phones I've ever put on.  I bought them primarily because of the comfort ratings, and I cannot understand the applause.  Yes, there are lightweight, and yes they seem to be somewhat self adjusting (more on that below), but I have a big head (7 3/4 hat size) and there is no way to adjust the tension on the ears.  You are stuck with one fit as far as I can determine.  And yes I wear glasses while wearing them, but even though the top reviewer said they were comfortable with glasses, to this noggin they were most decidedly not.  I think one of the problems with the design is the lack of depth in the foam.  To me it seems thin and not enough to compensate for the pressure.  I personally don't think they are comfortable even without glasses on.  So I'm going to see if I can return them.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I'd love the series; characters are very interesting and intelligent. Series is very enjoyable and I can't wait to see this last installment.
0439023521|4.0|I finished this book over the span of a couple days; I just couldn't put it down. It's really well-written, the story is intriguing and the characters are easy to empathize with. I got the feeling that near the end she didn't know how to conclude it, so she just finished the chapter and stopped writing. That's my only beef: you don't get closure until the last book.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Nobody who has spent 2 minutes with this app should give it more than 1 star.<br />I give it one star because it looks good, Oh also because Amazon does not allow 1/2 or 1/4 or 1/8th stars.<br />If you are reading this to figure out how to put a widget on you home screen hurry up and get a refund.<br />I wish I had a LG Optimus.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|For as old as this book is it still applies. This may have been the book that got many people actually thinking. As of the last year I have been reading all I can on this subject and most of what I have read just adds to this book. And a note, I have heard of some say this attacks religon. I don't think they could be futher from the truth. Dniken ask questions that gives one something to ponder. And the thought that there may be life on another planet seems to make sense. The thought they explored and set up camps, or bases also sounds right to me. If we ever get back to exploring space again I am sure one of our first steps will be  base on the moon. Or I hope so. And the God thing? I beleive in a higher power. And think it quite capable of creating life on many planets.

Patton Oswalt is a star finally. Theron called in this role.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Says it's not compatible with LG optimus, no good reason that it shouldn't be. The app is huge weighing in at 47mb. No widgets, so really... What is the point of a weather app without a widget to glance at?

B004O3YGMC|1.0|This product requires install on host computer to work along with holes in firewall.  This is a ripoff of probably a VNC product.  Splashtop will not even connect to Microsoft remote desktop without installing their product.  This is totally not what I wanted.
193413712X|2.0|The bright gold Pulitzer Prize emblem on the front cover caught my eye and I bought Tinkers thinking that a Pulitzer Prize winner must be a worthy read (plus the rave reviews of Harding's lovely prose were enticing as well). Honestly, the only thing that kept me from giving up on the book was the fact that it did win a Pulitzer so I continued to read it trying to figure out why it won an award. Tinkers is a very slow, pointless story of a dying man's recollections of his childhood as well as descriptions his father's life and a little bit of his grandfather's life. There is no plot to speak of and the characters are not well-developed. I found myself wondering when the gauzy, long-winded descriptions of the scenery would end and the actual story would begin. Admittedly, Harding's ethereal metaphors and vivid descriptive language is laudable and impressive. In fact, this book would be a great reference on writing style and creating lovely prose and fantastic descriptions, however, for pure entertainment/good reads, I would suggest looking for another book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|easy search, several versions. does everything I would need an electronic copy of the Bible to do. nice selection of devotionals.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|It's good. It brings back Paul McCartney memories. Songs are adapted for an older artist with less range than he once had.<br /> I'm glad that I purchased it.<br /><br /> Ed.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This definitely is not a kid movie.. i'm sure they'll like the animals and some of the \\"cute\\" stuff in it but this is almost 100% tailored for young adults.  That being said, its a great movie, good music, beautiful graphics and kind of goes back to the old school nickelodeon style that us of the 80's grew up with.
B007M6P01O|5.0|Great season yet again, not a single dull episode. I was wondering how they can hold newer episodes after losing so many cast members each episode, Jon Bernthal (Shane) and Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale) being the biggest cast members to leave just about 2 episodes apart but the show just somehow gets better and better leaving me in more suspense, CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 3 (BYE BYE HERSHEL'S FARM HELLO PRISON)

B003XT8Y3K|5.0|I had read good reviews for this CD in various opera and music magazines. And I had heard some of the songs from this CD on YouTube.  I am glad I purchased it. Jonas Kaufmann is an excellent musician with a beautiful masculine voice, deep understanding of the music and poems he is singing, and a real passion to express his feelings. He has a perfect control of his voice from ffff to pppp. He is a true artist.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|This is a great movie. I purchased it for my 4 year old nephew so we could watch it together. He loves the talking animals.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game was confusing at first, but I warmed up to it. Its pretty fun, although I don't like having to buy credits all the time.
B004RKXNDU|2.0|I thought I would read this book before I see the movie.  I will see the movie anyway, but this book was either the era it was written or my inability to appreciate the author's style but I kept falling asleep reading it.  Sorry, but I will scratch LaCarre off my list of other books to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When beginning this book, you quickly realize that it is one that you cannot easily put down. It is a very fast-paced, intriguing, read that one can finish in a short time period. I have read all three books in the trilogy, and I was very impressed. I have read some reviews that state that these books are flawed in some ways. My only statement in reference to that would be that all books are somewhat flawed; however, the flaws do not stand out at all in this series. My only complaint in this series, and its not much of one, was that the ending of the trilogy was less that desirable (for me at least). But even with the lack luster ending, the series is definitely worth reading.
B000002J03|4.0|Product showed up on time but with broken jewel case. Also, I was a little disappointed to find out this was a copy originally released in Argentina. CD quality is great but would like to have known that ahead of time...
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I can't believe this app doesn't have a widget! what good is it if I have to create a shortcut? they need to fix this asap or I am deleting this app! I thought thus would be better than beautiful Widgets and it looks way better, but the other one gas a decent widget I can add to my home screen.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I have not personally read this book yet, but my husband has and since he is a great admirer of the character Harry Bosch, and has probably read most of Michael Connelly's books, he thoroughly enjoyed it. A great read.
B0067LXQAW|4.0|First of all I've been a long time Cranberries fan since their first record in 1993, they had a unique sound from the beginning with the interplay of Delores's vocal and with the rest of the band, to produce a very refreshing distinctive sound.  Roses seems to carry on the tradition, even after almost 20 years, which I think is pretty amazing for a band.  While looking forward to their new cd, when it arrived, I decided to play their first album first and then Roses to see how different or similar it sounds.  Unfortunatly, when I first played Roses, on a fairly decent stereo system, I had to run and turn down the volume because my speakers were about to blow.  It was at least twice the volume as Everybody else is doing it  why can't we, cd. Even after turning down the volume, I noticed something else was wrong, the music had no dynamic range.  It was so heavily compressed that the drums sounded as loud as the bass, which was as loud as the vocal, as loud as the guitars and  background vocal etc.  It's<br /> not all the bands fault, but the record label's, sound and mixing engineer's, who over the last 20 years have been turning up the loudness in mixing and recording music in studio's, using too much compression and loudness and ruining what should be great sounding music, instead of a wall of mush that passes for music today. It is unfortunate that the quality of music is being compromised for the mistaken belief that loud is better and sells more records.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As an avid romance / erotic romance reader, I at first thought \\"Oh, here we go again...\\" boy was I wrong.  Christian and Ana's developing characters and the love story draws you page to page.  I couldn't put the books down.  I especially enjoyed the emails to one another and how in the end they finally realize each others independence as well as their dependance upon each other.  I loved these books and cannot wait for Ms. James to put pen to paper and give us another fantastic journey.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This could be a cool weather app if there was a widget available. But there isn't. Add and I'll revise my stars.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Of course the application is large! It says &quot;HD&quot; right on the icon. It's meant to look that way and be that large. It's an otherwise good looking app without the full functionality you would expect in a weather app.
0307352145|4.0|Quiet is the first book of its type that I have read and as such I found it to be quite revealing and mostly helpful.  The real gem is the first section dealing with a culture of character vs. a culture of personality.  I have often wondered what happened to the George Washington and Abraham Lincoln type leaders; that leadership that was based on quiet persistence, education and character.  These men operated in a world where it truly was WHAT you knew and not WHO you knew as it is now.  The the section on Tony Robbins awesome as Sarah Cain is clearly not a fan.  Another section I found very interesting is on modern \\"brainstorming\\" teams and \\"groupthinks\\"; as I am personally not a fan and feel like they largely pull people out of their expertise to work on something they are not good at or experienced with.<br /><br />There were really on two things that I did not enjoy about this book.  The first was that the author tended to switch roles from scientist to psychologist to cheerleader.  I think this is a main reason for some of the negative reviews that I read.  My second complaint is in regards to the notes at the end of the book as they were only linked to the text in the form of a page number and nothing more thereby making them largely unusable.  I for one love foot notes.<br /><br />On the whole I personally enjoyed the book and have already found it a great help in my personal life.<br /><br />3.75 Stars
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the characters.  I couldnt put it down. I cant wait to read more.

B0006N2EZ0|4.0|I was eager to get this video ordered the day Whitney Houston died because I remembered it as a really fine movie, fine performances by all, esp. Kevin Costner.

Strange.<br />We enjoyed the movie, but wondered what happened to these two sequences. Thank you for getting it to us quickly.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My son and I had a lot of fun playing this game. We had no trouble with the gameplay or the complexity of the puzzles - and he is only 6 years old!<br />Sure he looked at the hints here and there but he still beat it with hardly any help from me inside of 3 weeks.<br />I am not sure why people are complaining.  Just slow down and think about the maps and clues. Write down notes if you need too.<br />Good or bad, it was only $2. Better than the $40 I paid for Myst and Return to Zork years ago.<br />Relax and have fun!
0439023513|1.0|I've got tickets for the theatrical release of HG this Friday, so I spent time re-reading all three books in the trilogy.  Hunger Games is an outstanding novel.  The remaining books, particularly this one, were let downs.<br /><br />The main issue  that I have is the lack of hopefulness in the novels....to the point that a song of suicide is included.  Way too nihilistic.  Way too introspective.  The inclusion of a 13 year old  in a duplex firebomb was unbelievable from a military perspective and gratuitous.<br /><br />I know this won't stop anyone from reading the trilogy, but it was a very dissatisfying ending to what might have been a great trilogy.

B005HEGW56|5.0|I have to say that I enjoyed Enterprise almost as much as The Next Generation.  Its a little different because it starts out before the Federation but it left the show able to explore more plot ideas.  The seasons just got better as they went along and it was a shame that they ended the series at season 4.  Loved all the characters including all the special guests as well.  Highly recommend this!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Without going to watercooling, this cooler is awesome, it keeps my temps around 36c on a I2500K overclocked to 4.0.  The cooler is Very tall and depending on the motherboard layout, may block some of the taller memory sticks from being installed.  one solution is that the fan can be adjusted so if the preinstalled fan is too close to your memory, just take the fan off and move it then reattach the fan.  Luckly I did not have that problem.  I had a problem with it touching the door to my case.  It is only about 1cm away from the case door so I have to be Extremely careful not to let anything hit my computer there otherwise the entire thing may be damaged.  Other than that this thing is very easy to install and feels like a super expensive cooler.  Best buy for the money in my opinion.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|a good game, some challenging levels. good time killer or puzzle solving time. I haven't lost interest in it so far - a keeper for me!

006112429X|5.0|This is probably one of the most disturbing books I have ever read.  Eva, Kevin's mother, is a desperate woman faced with an unlovable child.  The father, Franklin, is clueless to say the least and in total denial that their son is beyond redemption.  It is sometimes difficult to read but the author's prose and outstanding way with words makes it a brilliant novel in spite of its subject matter.  As a retired teacher, one of my main goals in the classroom was to teach children, above all, to be humane.  In this sense, I shuddered when I read Kevin's cruel and unremorseful words and behaviors.  I had to keep reminding myself that, thankfully, this was a work of fiction.

B005FITIK0|5.0|As a journalism degree holding, wannabe writer (despite or in spite lots of published articles) and a grown-up with a severe case of straddle syndrome (adult/adolescent), I found this movie to be refreshingly honest and poignant. There were MANY scenes that were highly relatable to my own personal and professional life (from drinking excessive amounts of diet pop to wearing hello kitty pjs).<br /><br />Is Mavis self-indulgent, self-absorbed and at times pathetically out-of-touch? Yes. But she's also lost and lonely and searching for meaning.<br /><br />With more and more twentysomethings living at home, more adults waiting longer to marry and more people having trouble finding fulfilling relationships, Mavis is an emblem for the \\"young adult.\\" Along the way, she finds Patton Oswalt's character who is also trapped in YA world because of a brutal attack long ago. They've both arrived at the same place and are stuck.<br /><br />Diablo Cody has a terrific way of designing characters who are all at once despicable and inspiring (no one wants to end up like Mavis). Charlize captures the essence of a person who never grew up and is still wrestling with her adulthood avoidance and delusions of grandeur.
B000IZA9NU|1.0|This movie is a destruction of good work done over years. The story line is weak, complex relationships and tensions among crew members are torn apart and solved in a blink of an eye. Seems like a big revenge strike against those who always knew better (and used to be in charge). Characters are flat and their relationships reflect no desire for bridging cultural gaps, for understanding, something that  used to be so important in the saga. I do not really see why every feature version has to come with a full destruction of the ship, but so be it, if the story carries. Unfortunately, also the directing makes it clear from the very beginning that the god guys are going to win once more, an attitude which (since we know this will happen because it has to) frankly reflects the lack of precision in directing (not only the story). A pity, but this is just a crash and explosion movie that tries to exploit the saga. Well, I guess it worked at the time, and it paid well.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Occasionally, I buy a CD because of only one song. 'Somebody that I used to know' is the hit. The rest of the album is also worth listening, but not the same enchanting.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|looks nice but it's not a widget. No thanks.  I was hoping to see this on my home screen.  Uninstall
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Nice looking and covers more if the globe. I'm assuming since some say no widgets and others live them that due to the size most users move this to the sd card right away. If so, that's why you don't have widgets
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Really useful and easily organized.  Would like to combine this and Pinterest.  Great way to share recipes and tips too.
B003O86FMW|3.0|So the first book was superbly constructed and it excited everyone's imagination.  The second book is a bit more like the formulaic sequel that tries to rekindle (pun intended) what everyone loved about the first book.  I don't think it succeeds, and it will probably be bit of letdown to you.  But it is still quite entertaining, and if you were a fan of the first book, you should go for it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Great read and very entertaining! I think you have to be a certain age to get some of the jokes (and I'm younger), but even if you're not, if you like Tina Fey even a little bit you will love it! The best way to describe it is an honest book.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|While I thought the first book was very exciting, and the second was a bit \\"me too\\", I found the third book to be boring and drawn out.  The whole premise, which I'll try to avoid spoiling, felt very unbelievable.  Whereas you wanted to have your disbelief suspended in the first novel just to allow for the spectacle of the arena, in this book, I found the whole thing ridiculous.  It's as if the whole world revolves around one talented-but-unlikable girl (though I'm sure that teenage girls idolize her independence and \\"spirit\\"), and that the world is run by a small city where everyone is evil and selfish.  I will just bite my tongue about how the plot is impossible in so many ways, but the only reason I finished this book is because it wasn't too long, and I had already read the previous two books.  I just wanted it over with.  I wish that the first book had ended with more resolution, so I could have just stopped there.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Excellent, available on my kindle fire. I enjoy the ease and flexible reading of this verision.  I travel often and find the amazon.com verison provides what I want.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I avoided this book because it was so popular and because it's juvenile fiction.  Thanks to many recommendations from adults I know, I decided to find out what all the fuss was about.  This book has very fast plotting and exciting situations, and overall I enjoyed it very much.  But I do think that the plot and situations are far-fetched, and you can only consider this science fiction minus any actual science.  (It's definitely more like science-fantasy.)  If you liked this book you should go read Ender's Game.  Trust me on that.
1401937519|5.0|Anita's spontaneous recovery from cancer did not happen to me with my cancer experience.  What she talks about with that connection to God or what I like to call \\"source energy\\" did happen.  What she talks about in her journey was spot on in my opinion.  Wonderful reading - really will help people trying to understand their own experiences.  I am buying books for friends!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|These books are page turners and were really hard to put down. I'm not into mysteries and who done its this is totally different. I wasn't expecting this at all. The characters are really well developed, there wasn't any drag anywhere and not once did I have urge to skip anything and the endings to each of the books aren't anti-climactic in any way shape or form. These books do have a violent nature so careful. The best way to describe Lisbeth Salander is the perfet anti-heroin. I love her character. It's a real disappointment and a huge loss that Stieg Larsson passed away, I could not even fathom what his other books would have been like.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great read. You have to fight yourself to put the book down. It's an amazing story that was recounted in extreme detail.

4883191028|2.0|I'm currently studying abroad and decided to take a Japanese I language course. Their book of choice was Minna no Nihongo accompanied by a school specific supplementary work book. I've studied Mandarin at my home university for two years, and I had grown comfortable and fond of the books we use in those classes, Integrated Chinese (which I recommend to any person wishing to study Chinese, and to start with Integrated Chinese Level 1 Part 1). Unfortunately, coming into this course and using the textbook was difficult for me and I struggled with not having any english to explain grammar points or to have a back of the book dictionary to help with the vocab.<br /><br />I personally dislike using this book because of the lack of explanation in English about Japanese grammar points, and new vocabulary. I understand how not having English as a crutch can encourage a new learner to study Japanese and learn it faster, but for me it has become a deterrent and I've grown to dislike studying from this book because of the amount of frustration it causes me everyday. I'd also tried learning Mandarin from a chinese sunday school years ago where they used similar books to Minna no Nihongo which contained no english and only chinese characters and the zhouyin system. It was very frustrating then as well, and it was when I was able to learn from a textbook with english explanations that I improved and understood.<br /><br />I would recommend this book if you can read and write hiragana and katakana, and have some background knowledge of Japanese. For those who are beginners with no knowledge and who like having an explanation of what they're studying in english and the grammar points of the language with clear examples, I would not recommend this textbook.

B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I wanted a weather app for my kindle fire, but I hate apps that run in the background constantly (let us uninstall pulse, amazon!).  This app gives me all the info I want (current, 5 day, hour by hour) without always runnning in the background or otherwise being annoying.

1416550534|4.0|The life was luxurious, yet, it had all of the sorrows everyone's life holds. No one escaped the tragedies of life, not even the wealthy aristocratic family at Riverton.  The writing enveloped you, treated you to the upstairs life as well as the downstairs life. Each character was well described. (I only felt that at times, an event, such as the father's death, left you without the adequate description the character deserved.)<br />The combining of the lives, the parallel telling of events, led you to a wonderful ending climaxing in an explosion of happenings, woven together as their lives were woven together.<br />I certainly delighted in its' revelations and look forward to reading other works by Kate Morton.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it was awesome and really good but kinda sad i read all three and really enjoyed them and thing there should be more books
B00003CX5P|1.0|Awful script, awful acting, awful CGI, awful storyline, Jar Jar Binks... need I say more? Thank you, George Lucas. You destroyed the entire Star Wars saga with this crapfest. I really appreciate it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I will admit, I was curious after hearing about the rave reviews regarding Fifty Shades of Grey.  I bought the book only knowing that the story revolved around a romance between two complicated characters.  Complicated?? NOT SO MUCH.<br /><br /> Anastasia-  I am sorry, but I simply don't buy into the naivety that she constantly emanates.  The girl is 21 years old and has absolutely NO sexual experiences whatsover?? Okay, maybe this is possible. BUT, she is totally willing to enter into this disturbing sexual relationship with this man?? Ridiculous!!<br /><br /> Speaking of ridiculous, the repetitive over-the-top descriptions of this man made me giggle at the absurdity!  I believe at some point he was compared to \\"dark chocolate covered caramel\\"!  HAHA!  Perhaps I'm off on this particular quote, but I'm not willing to go back through the book to find out.  I laughed out loud at these comical, unbelievable descriptions.<br /><br />If for no other reason, I HAD to put the book down due to the absolutely DULL thought processes of this girl. If I had to read \\"Oh my\\" or \\"Holy crap\\" or \\"Holy ****\\" one more time, I might throw my kindle.  Honestly, the writing was consistantly redundant, right up until the last \\"hitched breath\\". Oh, and clearly we all clamber into and out of everything (i.e. hellicopters, cars, the bed, etc).<br />TERRIBLE writing. How anyone can read this story and call it \\"quality\\" is beyond me.<br /><br />Another absurd characteristic of Anastasia - why the subconconsious AND the inner goddess stream of thought??? Is Ana really schizophrenic?  It seems there are at least three main characters wrapped up in one!<br /><br />I despised Christian.  His constant need to control her both in and outside of the room of pain was PAINFUL to read.  And she complied simply because she supposedly loves him? Even though he isn't remotely interested in a relationship, but would rather OWN her?!  Preposterous!<br /><br />Thank goodness Amazon allows a kindle return policy, because I definitely wanted my money back 30% in to this garbage.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME.  Unless you want your IQ lowered by the end of this book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book, the weaving of factual events and photos with a fictional story leaves a reader easily transported in to the imagination of the author. Other reviews state problems viewing the photos and hand written notes, but those are novice readers inexperienced on using the reading features of the kindel for all one has to do is hold a finger on the images in books to highlight it and the option for zoom becomes available.<br />I am excited to read more of Jacob and Emma's story when it comes out!
B00000JLWW|5.0|The incredible drama and collosal human failure of the Titanic never cease to fascinate. No fortune teller could have predicteted how fate would bring tennis players Dick Williams and Karl Behr together on the Titanic, envisaged their hair-raising survival, or foretold how they would come together as Davis Cup Teammates and Wimbeldon opponents. Lindsay Gibbs does a brilliant job in her conception of the two main characters. Helen, the love of Behr's life is a truly memorable character. Beautifully written, A Must Read<br /><br />DB  WASHINGTON DC
B001E45XT4|4.0|The very first time I bought these headphones was about a year ago, off the Walmart website. I was just looking for headphones that would cover my ears! These were on sale at the time, and thus the cheapest ones. So, I got them with little hopes they would be any good.<br /><br />I have a very small head considering I'm a under 5 foot teenaged girl that's a normal size. They cover my ears, and fit TIGHTLY on my head at first. I constantly had to take them off to keep blood flowing to my ears. But my friends in Skype calls all commented that I sounded much neater. A bit tinny, but not bad. My recordings of my voice was a lot smoother, and I couldn't hear back ground noise in the recording like I normally do.<br /><br />I kept using the headphones for quite a bit. Became protective of them as well! If friends came over to listen to music, they had to use the itchy and always tight skull candy head phones. The 'earmuffs' pretty much morphed to fit my head, and they fit great~! Still kinda do...<br /><br />I recently stepped on my headphones, and the thick plastic couldn't handle my sleepy weight, and thus snapped right in half. The padding on top keeps it together, but I just knew it was time for a new one! I looked around for a bit and soon discovered them on this site, even cheaper then what I paid Walmart for!<br /><br />Cant picture myself using any different head phones.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I'm very pleased with the CD and have listened to it several times already.  It's soothing and relaxing to listen to and a pleasant reminder of old songs that I used to listen to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  The pages flew, and I just couldn't get enough.  I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who loves suspense, and a character to root for.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book has several issues that take away from the overall story. In all honesty, it just seems like she got bored and gave up because the first half of the book was okay but then she started to put action in where it didn't belong and killing people like it added to the plot. If anything it made it more confusing. Certain people she had killed made sense like-spoiler- Finnick (as much as I cried at that) but killing Prim, it didn't fit. I would also like to include that Gale would've never have just left like that.<br />So clearly my opinion on this book is not a pleasnt one but my reasons make sense. Overall this book wasn't written to its full potential and could've gone off in a different direction. For those who want to know why this book is the way it is it could've been that there were too many different senerios that could've unfolded and the author didn't know what to do. It could've also been deadlines, stress, or frustration. Whatever the reason is, this book didn't meet many people's expectations. I know I've been tough on a great author but this is how others as well as myself feel how this book turned out.

B00009W0U4|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I watched it 3 times and thought it was a great film. But I became worried I would watch it again and rot my brain further, so I threw it in the dumpster today. After watching this film, you want to watch an episode of Seinfeld or the Smurfs. Ugh... Pierre, why?

B005LAIGZU|3.0|This review is not a review of a Blu Ray or DVD but on the content of the movie.  I went to see Act of Valor in the theater I felt let down a little bit because it did not shed light on what families of military personnel had to go through to make any war possible.  While I applaud the heroic effort of the men and women protecting our countries from extremists, the film ignores the family members who have been equally burden by the absence of their significant others.  It seems that family members have no voice and no role in the conflict.  In addition, the actors portraying these heroes are too devoid of emotions.  As I watched the movie I didn't feel anything other than being thankful of their service to their nation.  Act of Valor should have made me feel rather than being informed, too bad.<br /><br />With regard to detail, the movie begins with a scene that was suppose to be in the Philippine but was shot in Cambodia.  As I watched the movie I saw buildings and famous landmark in Phnom Penh Cambodia and I did a quick fact check in my head and I didn't remember any recent news about bomb blast in Phnom Penh.  I was confused for about 45 seconds into the movie until I realize it was just a movie location.  In the age of internet and google search if the story is in the Philippine they should have just went to the Philippine to shoot it there.  Don't assume the viewers are ignorant about locations of the world.
B0042KZJR8|1.0|I bought this CD for my wife who loves Buble. What I didn't realize was that the selections were retreads from previous albums, some of which she already has. I thought the production was sloppy, with sound quality variations. Buble gets better all the time. This rehash of his past performances does not reflect his current performance level. And the selections were a bit boring. Whenever I see the name of the producer, David Foster, I generally can count on a less than stellar arrangement and selection of songs, no matter who the artist is.
B004EPZ0BQ|4.0|This review focuses on the content of the movie and not on the features of the Blu Ray.  First off, I loved this movie; comparatively it was better than No Strings Attach with Portman and Kucher.  The chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis seems very real and believable.  It was so believable that it led me to believe that they might have had a real relationship while working together.  Both are funny, energetic and sexy(Mila Kunis)characters that carry the whole movie, from beginning to end.  You know a movie is good when you're rooting for their relationship to work out as you're watching it.  Very good romantic comedy.  In fact, I will get it on Blu Ray to add to my collections.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Amazing; Listening to these tracks will take you back to the days of listening to your transistor radio under your sheets at night.  You didn't want wake up your parents.  We were so clever.
B005R32L66|5.0|I would have to say that this is still the best VOIP Android app available on the market. I never get dropped calls and the video quality is great for the device it is on. All Skype calls are free to other Skype users and it is easy to setup other family and friends. I have tried several of the other Android apps and they still don't stand up to the reliability and call quality of this app. So if you want free calls to others feel free to download and check it out.
B007M6P01O|5.0|Only one word can describe the season ending episode.....WOW!!!!!! I can't wait for season 3 to see what will happen next. Rick's admitting to the group what Jenner told him at the CDC was something I had figured out a couple episodes back. One thing I can't wait to see is where the group will land next.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The series..<br /><br />It's a very entertaining series that not only has an awesome storyline but also has great acting.<br /><br />There is a lot of nudity and the violence can be a bit gruesome at times.  But I don't think it was overdone to the point that it seemed forced.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it was only 10 episodes.  I finished it over the weekend and was left wanting more.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Blu-Ray set<br /><br />The container is very nice and contains a helpful informational insert on the episodes and the world of westeros.  The artwork is also top notch.<br /><br />Once you load one of the discs, there are 2 things that really stand out to me.<br /><br />1) The in-game episode guide - it gives you the option of having a side menu present during the episode where you can easily access information on the characters in the current scene and the current location.  Really great for keeping track of what is going on in the scene if you happen to get lost.<br /><br />2) Seamless integration between discs.  Regardless of what disc is inserted, you can select any of the 10 episodes.  If you select an episode on another disc, then it allows you to switch discs without exiting and it continues to that episode.<br /><br />The only gripes with the set is lack of scene selection and long load time when you first start up.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Overall, this tv series is 2nd to none in it's genre and is a very close representation of the book \\"Game of Thrones\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was amazing and completely addicting. I read all 3 over the weekend. Was it the best written maybe not but really pick up any Historical Romance. This is the first BDSM I have read and can say if they are all written like this I may become a big fan. I was expecting really hard core freaky things and that was not in this trilogy. The characters are believable and you really feel connected to them. The author did a wonderful job of sucking you in and keeping you in the moment. I really think that if you go into this Trilogy with an open mind you will be pleasantly surprised and very pleased. There was enough \\"kink\\" to make you think \\"Hmmm, I wonder what that would be like and feel like\\". The sex was a mix of hot, mild and oh so loving. Lots of sex but again open mind and you will see why the author has created it as so, to me each sex scene represented something about the character and helped you understand each characters needs better. In the end, you will fall in love with these characters.<br /><br />I think that the media did a disservice to this author and books. They portrayed this book in a very different light.  But to each their own.
7883700928|5.0|I am so happy with the product. My daughter speaks both English and Mandarin so I want her to be exposed to both languages including watching them on TV.  Although, I was able to play the dvd on my mulit-region DVD player (and I set it to region 6) the movie itself would only play audio in English, very annoying,  but it was probably just something wrong with my DVD player.<br /><br />I changed the region on my laptop (macbook pro, and note you can only change the region 4 times before it locks) and it played perfectly.  The voice-actors were great and fit perfectly with the movie (not a monotone knockoff).  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good quality cartoon in Mandarin.

B0072QPV6I|5.0|The Package comes with a CD (which is Handy). the performance was AMAZING! it looks and sounded great on the theatre system!
0385344228|4.0|Many others have provided excellent detail regarding this book, so I will not attempt to further do so.<br /><br />I found this to be an involving book that would be engaging for a wide range of ages and fictional preferences.  The family and social dynamics are all well developed, and the narrative presented is easy to read, and generally easy to follow.<br /><br />A few noted specific issues brought forth just didn't tie in with the other primary features as the story line further developes.  The inconsistancy or failure to communicate the coming and going of the DA toward the end of the book was confusing as I read it, and remains so after having completed it.<br /><br />I found the first 80% or so of this book to drag on a bit, with almost too much speed and acceleration toward the end, as if the author suddenly realized he was running out of paper.<br /><br />That all said, I enjoyed this book.
B0070TDERU|5.0|I started the series on a recommendation from a friend and was able to watch the first season free on Amazon Prime. I liked it so much I purchased the beginning of the second season until I caught up with it on TV. It has become a favorite of mine and I can't wait for the next season!

B006SMLAMQ|3.0|gives weather any where in the world and videos are good. no better than any other free weather ap. might be better for globe trotters. not worth a paid version. not enough settings or an on screen widget, also hate the dark clock.  ok but not for me. i will stick with Be Weather it has much more detailed weather, and videos to.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Really? A 46 MB download for a weather widget? I don't think so. There is no reason this should be so big but for bad programming. &quot;I would say don't quit your day job,&quot; but I feel that, sadly, this is your day job. Fail.
B0013JZDSG|1.0|I adore this album, and purchased the MP3 album to replace a lost CD from Amazon.  The encodings are horrible, full of crackle and hiss in all but the most quiet tracks.  It appears that the encoding was done from a CD with a diminished dynamic range, which was compounded by the loss of quality inherent in MP3 encoding.<br /><br />In short? Buy the CD, and rip it yourself unless you are mostly deaf.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|what can i say. there is no widget, it's huge in size it doesnot include automatic current location does give many options that other do like sunrise and sunset. generally it fails. and with this size i will just uninstall it.
0062112430|4.0|It's really not that much of a stretch to think of being in love as being \\"infected\\", though in general we don't like to think it makes us certifiable. But in this dystopian novel by Lauren Oliver, that's precisely what has happened: love (in all its forms) has been declared the enemy, but not to worry, the \\"procedure\\" will make everything right...boring and predictable, but all right. And unless you were unfortunate enough to become infected before your eighteenth birthday, it will be a blessing that all has been laid out before you with no unnecessary emotion to muddy the waters. Here's where it gets tricky for heroine Lena; she's met Alex, a young man who quite suddenly has made her no longer wish to join the ranks of the \\"cured\\", but instead escape into the Wilds where the pair can be together with all its ensuing emotions. And naturally there's where everything really goes awry.<br /><br />Delirium follows Lena, whose mother succumbed to the dreaded infection, as she faces the summer after her senior year waiting for the medical procedure that will provide her with the cure, knowing it will mean she will no longer be friends with best friend Hana and that her future mate will be someone chosen for her after her evaluation by the government boards. Lena is okay with this until Alex's appearance, and when she learns that he is only pretending to be cured, their dangerous relationship takes on further edge. Alex shows her what life could be without the procedure, but Lena is torn...until she realizes that not only will she lose Alex, but her whole life has been a lie perpetuated by those who are supposed to be closest to her. And then it's a race against time to keep from having the procedure, no matter the cost.<br /><br />This novel is filled with interesting characters, though at times some situations seemed a little too easy for Lena; no one seems to noticed her frequent trips past curfew through the streets of Portand, and her mute youngest cousin is obviously hiding something important. I was able to figure out the twist with Lena's mother early on, and the reliability of friend Hana was very convenient. However, still figuring out where I was headed in this story didn't detract from the excitement of the emotions Lena experiences, and the edge of your seat drama at the end was riveting. If Lena is a bit too naive at times, and then a bit too headstrong, it's fully expected of teens to be just that, especially when faced with critical decisions that will affect not just your own life but the lives of those you care about. Delirium may not be the perfect dystopian novel, but it is fun and engaging, and that's what matters to this reader. Bring on Pandemonium!y hiding something important.

B004J4WKTW|2.0|Both my husband I were reading this book, he on my Kindle and I an audible recording.  Neither of us finished and both stopped around the same place.<br />We are not into the dark side of things and this became very dark.  For me it was the beginning of Evil, I read further than I did because I had hope it would get better.  If you are into the really dark side of magic and mystic matter, you will enjoy,  I didn't.  Also, listening was very difficult at times to understand not great audio.

B00079HZUM|5.0|I caught this film on cable by chance, and ever since I've been wanting to see it again, so I'm ordering it here. The story is interesting (female roles played by males in English theater), the setting is 17th century London (which never ceases to entertain and fascinate audiences for reasons I don't understand because I'm one of the fascinated ones...), and the acting is superb. Claire, as usual, nailed the role. But the real surprise is Billy Crudup. He's magnificent in this film, so good, I didn't even recognized him until half-way into the movie. He turned into this character completely. He alone is worth watching this film for, but the movie offers so much more. If you like this time period, English theater, unusual love stories, and skillful film making and acting, you'll enjoy this film.
0553381709|3.0|I started the Martin series as I read he was \\"like a modern day Tolkien\\". Sadly this is far from accurate. After reading 3 of his series I came to the conlcusion he just likes to write. The story ramble on so much I lost interest in thinking about where it might be going. This 3rd book is a 1000 pages of rambling story line. It has its good moments and the imagination that went into the concept is very good. Let's leave it this way, there is still one more book in the series of 4 and I will not read it. When I read the trilogy by Tolkien I couldn't wait to read the last one. It is really too bad as his concept and creativity were great.

1589795474|5.0|Even though this book was written back last century (1990's), the information is still relevant now.  \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" analyzes who millionaires are really are.  More importantly, it analyzes on what they actually do to become millionaires or prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAW).<br /><br />Now, money is not the most important thing in life.  But, it is up there.  Money or wealth gives you options and choices in life.  The more money; the more options.  It does not make you any more important than someone with lesser money.<br /><br />This book illustrates how true millionaires would be careful on how they spend their money on items such as suits, cars, shoes, etc.  Most millionaires are not extravagant.  Also, most millionaires live in ordinary neighborhoods with ordinary neighbors.  It is important to know these facts because it is easy to look like a millionaire but be in debt.  It is easier to have a \\"big hat\\" with \\"no cattle\\".<br /><br />As you learn the principles to spend wisely, become a prodigious accumulator of wealth, become independent from advertising on consumption, have a spouse who is even more wise with money, and know that what you see in television and in the media on the wealthy is not always true- then you can be that \\"Millionaire Next Door\\".<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

0439023521|5.0|After numerous people told me to read this book I finally gave in & bought a copy, well I was not disappointed. I had heard a variety of<br />opinions on the subject matter so I read with an open mind. This is an unusual book in fact I had flashbacks of Spartacus as well as the daily dose of, in your face Reality TV, which I have no interest in. But the ingredients work & the reader finds themselves on an emotional roller coaster of a ride. I'm sure the book appeals to different people on different  levels, depending on the age group & their experiences in life. Despite being futuristic, our heroine is living in a time when her number one priority is survival & to what lengths she has to go to preserve that. No texting, tweeting, facebook, email or smartphone for her or her loved ones it's back to basics. Now there's a concept.

0439023491|5.0|Having read the Hunger Games I knew I had to complete the trilogy so as soon as I had finished it I went out & got Catching Fire. When I first started it I wondered if I was going to be as impressed because it seemed a little slow, plus lots of going backwards & forwards with Katniss's feelings for Gale & Peeta. Then I had to remind myself this is a girl of now 17 who has no experience when it comes to boys, there's no time for romance in her life it has never been a priority. But then I got caught up in the ride & the betrayals & not knowing who to trust yet again. This book is a worthy sequel to the Hunger Games.
0439023513|1.0|There really isnt much to say about this book so I'll keep it brief.  The series got progressively worse after Hunger Games and this book ended on an empty note for me.  It got so annoying reading about Katniss and her mental instability that I found it difficult to keep going.  Seriously, these people live as slaves in a cruel world and she goes from mentally tough enough to win the Hunger games to a sobbing mess who constantly needs sedated in order to calm her down?  Really?<br /><br />The first person perspective worked well for Hunger Games but it fell short in the final two books.  The events because too complex and it was boring to see them only from Katniss's point of view.  Again, I might expect the sulking teenager act from my kids today, but in the Panem world I think they would be grown up at a much earlier age due to circumstance.<br /><br />I will continue to recommend Hunger Games to others but I will tell them to stop there and use their imagination for what happens afterward.  The ending would be more satisfying than the one the author gave us.

It's nice to see a movie get back to what vampires are, blood sucking death machines who'd rather rip your throat out than look at you. There's no cry baby vampire wannabe's like in Twilight, if the vamps from that movie ran into Jerry they'd pee themselves!<br /><br />minor spoiler.<br /><br />I liked that the original Jerry had a brief cameo in the movie. I also like that they kept a the originals flavor just modernized and even more dark with less 80's fluff.

B00003CXA2|5.0|I really dont know what i love more, the book or the movie. Forrest Gump was one of the most distinguished and classic films of my lifetime.  Its a story of a simpleton who goes through his life with a sense of determination that seems to blow the minds of most of the people he meets.  His decisions are always pretty clear.  He spends his life doing the right thing and holding true to the first friend and one true love of his life Jenny, who due to a child rearing of molestation and child abuse cracks down and falls to heroin and promiscuous sex.  This movie is a must for any american history buff. Forrest is a part of every major piece of history he experiences in his life.  He is a vietnam war hero, he walks dead on into a landmark of what would become the tear down of segregation, he witnesses the watergate scandal and the aids epidemic.  A simple man who experiences an unbelievably full life.  The movies scenery was inspired by norman rockwell and the soundtrack is phenominal.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Treasure Planet was not a blockbuster hit like its predecessors, through no fault of its own. It is one of Disney's rare cult classics, gathering a small but rabid following of fans who praise its beautiful, revolutionary art direction, including the use of fully-mapped CGI environments upon which the characters were animated, and the fun, genuine voices of the all-star cast including Emma Thompson, David Hyde Pierce, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It is a true Disney story with its young protagonist, Jim Hawkins, growing from a sullen teenager to a brave, hard-working young adult in one amazing adventure through space.<br /><br />The story was pulled from Robert Louis Stevenson's swashbuckling masterpiece Treasure Island, in which the young Jim Hawkins grows to care for his mentor John Silver and is therefore devastated to learn that his teacher is in fact a pirate in disguise, looking to mutiny along with the rest of the crew. The story is translated to sci-fi amazingly well, using a 70-30 ratio for the mise-en-scene of the whole thing. 70% is true to its original tale; characters wear 18th century fashion, the architecture of the spaceport is all Georgian, and the ship on which they travel is a beautiful three-mast schooner with a few modifiers for the journey. 30% is sci-fi, with laser guns, giant holographic treasure maps, and a crew of exotic aliens ranging from cute to downright scary.<br /><br />(Detractors of the movie quickly point out that the ship is not closed, and how could they be breathing in space anyway? The directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, revealed in the 'Art of...' book that the universe where they live does not work with the same properties as ours. There is air and weather in space, as well as nebulas and dying stars to make the journey treacherous.)<br /><br />Treasure Planet as a whole deserves more credit. It features all the basics of a Disney classic: a handsome, sympathetic main character; a diabolical antagonist who you come to care for as much as the heroes; a bumbling sidekick and his leading-lady love interest; and the slightly-annoying Third Act Addition character. The story carries as much heart as, say, Lion King or Pinocchio. The art is truly stunning; just sit back and watch the colors of space swirl across your TV screen, or the subtle-but-perfect facial expressions of the characters. Clements and Musker admit much time and thought was put into the eye movements of the characters, trying to make them look as real-life as possible.<br /><br />Last but not least, I need to mention and rave about the score. James Newton Howard really seemed to throw himself into making the soundtrack as beautifully classic as possible, with a full orchestra really setting the mood for a pirate tale set in the 1700's. It has several moments of pure adrenaline, pure bittersweet happiness, and pure longing for your own ship and crew to take to the stars.<br /><br />The picture quality for the Blu-ray is sound. The transition up from standard def did not result in the sparkling white of the drawn lines that afflicted the Beauty and the Beast Blu-ray; everything here is crisp and clear and smooth, and the upscale resulted in the most vibrant colors I've ever seen from this movie. The background of space in its swirls of blues and purples and the warm and cool colors of the digital lighting from fire to nighttime are better than they've ever been. The CGI parts of the movie were also upgraded with the release; one of the detractors of the film was that the brand-new computer graphic technology looked janky or amateur. Not anymore. Now it fits seamlessly into the 2D world and you barely notice it.<br /><br />The sound of the movie blew me right out of my living room. Granted, I do have Bose speakers, but I've watched my DVD of Treasure Planet plenty of times, and never before has it sounded so grand and clear. It was clearly tinkered with, to give even more life to this movie. I heard background noises that I'venever noticed before, like the conversion had made them better.<br /><br />The ONLY, ONLY ONLY ONLY, problem I had with this release was that the special features have all been seen before. The only new parts were introductions to each section of feature (art direction, characters, animation, development, etc.) by Laurie Metcalf, the actress who voiced Jim's mother Sarah Hawkins. The interviews with the creators and directors were all on the DVD, and they're included on the Blu-ray in standard def, with black borders and pixellated images reminding you that you're watching featurettes from 10 years ago.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a Blu-ray worth buying and treasuring forever. Since I never, ever believed it would come out in 1080p glory, I'm about to fall to my knees and kiss Disney's boots. You will not regret giving this larger-than-life movie a chance, and I'm willing to bet you will find it a welcome addition to your Disney Blu-ray collection.never noticed before, like the conversion had made them better.<br /><br />The ONLY, ONLY ONLY ONLY, problem I had with this release was that the special features have all been seen before.

0062119044|1.0|I don't mind dark and disturbing, but with this one I kept feeling like, \\"Why?\\" Why was I bothering with this? There were so many irritating things. The author's first person account was far from realistic. The flowery language and complicated sentence structure belied a lack of depth. (And I like Pynchon so I'm not afraid of complex sentence structure). It was dark all the time, and therefore rang false and empty. Even in the midst of bringing up a horrible child, which I guess is what this book might have been about (or was it about being a horrible mother?) there should have been glimpses of light--something redeeming. Otherwise, why go on? That was my inevitable conclusion with the book as well. Why go on? So I didn't. I read more than half and then just got too disgusted with the character and her lack of interesting things to say to bother continuing. It's just not that interesting to read one dark thing after another. It gets just as dull as a novel by Pollyanna. I feel like the author is hiding her lack of complex ideas in darkness. As in\\" \\"See! It's so DARK! Wow!\\" Boring.
B005FITIK0|4.0|This is a tough movie to review, because it made me feel bad (like a 3 star film), but yet I could not look away due to the engrossing performance (like a 5 star film). I don't want to say it was a train-wreck, because that's just too obvious, given that the plot is about a woman who was a trainwreck. Charlize deserves as many awards for this as she does for her other transformative roles, like Monster, and I am on the verge of saying I liked this movie and doing the whole Facebook \\"thumbs-up\\" routine, but this film distinctly felt like a terrible movie surrounding a hypnotic performance. It is a very detailed character study, much like the film \\"Terri,\\" and I am sure it will get recognized more than Terri, but the empathy I had for the characters in Terri, I could not quite muster-up for the Young Adult characters. I wanted to laugh more, but the funny angles were all smothered in a sort of uneasiness. I don't think I will be able to fully make up my mind until I see it again, and it was prickly enough the first time, so that might not happen. Regardless, Charlize carried the movie, with a little help from Patton Oswald's less-believable supporting role.<br /><br />If you like the indie film genre, then there is really no reason to avoid witnessing this amazing performance, since you probabaly have watched everything else in the genre, However, I would rent \\"Me, You and Everyone We Know,\\" or \\"Junebug,\\"first, if you have not already seen those. They have a somewhat similar honest/dark artful indie-comedy thing going on.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|\\"The Iron Lady\\" got two Oscars nominations (Best Achievement in Makeup and Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role) and won both, but received no other nominations. Perhaps this fact tells you something about this biographical movie about Margaret Thatcher here played by Meryl Streep. Not surprisingly, Meryl Streep shows what a seasoned performer like her can do, and you will not be disappointed with her acting. As to the film itself, however, maybe you should read a book instead.<br /><br />My complaint is a simple one. This is a life story of a political icon Margaret Thatcher, and that means it is full of events, so why not tell the story in a straightforward and linear way?<br /><br />Instead of that, \\"The Iron Lady\\" insists on showing Margaret Thatcher in her later years, seeing hallucinatory visions of her deceased husband Denis (Jim Broadbent). The film goes back and forth in time between today when aged Margaret Thatcher is seen talking with Denis, and several important episodes in her political career like the Falklands War.<br /><br />I don't know who is responsible for the unnecessarily complicated narrative structure, writer Abi Morgan (\\"Shame\\") or director Phyllida Lloyd (\\"Mamma Mia!\\"). Despite the solid performances from the supports including Richard E. Grant and Anthony Head, \\"The Iron Lady\\" does not tell us much about Margaret Thatcher, whether as a prime minister or a person.

B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Wow, this looked like it would be an app with some nice looking widgets. Which it sorta is. However, to get the widgets, this has to be installed on the phone, not SD card, at almost 50 MB. And there's no customization to the widgets besides location, without even the option to use geolocation. The widgets all just take you to the app, which just looks like widgets on a home screen. Here, the backgrounds transition clumsily and it's really easy to click on something and not be completely sure what the information you're seeing is without taking a minute to figure it out. Definitely not worth paying for, and even free it's not worth the space it takes up. Get something like Beautiful Widgets and you'll be much happier.

032147404X|3.0|Scott Kelby is a leading photography author for one main reason - he delivers!  The first three books in this series are really excellent for photographers of all levels of experience.  He takes an interesting subject and discusses key ways to learn this skill over just a few pages in the book.  Then he moves to another subject.  His recommendations for equipment/software are right on and not overdone.  These books are NOT, however, a complete textbook on digital photography.  They ARE just interesting topics (like how to capture close-ups, simple on-camera flash, simple studio lighting, etc.) and provides step-by-step instructions to perform that specific set-up.  His topics are very interesting and helpful. His writing style is conversational and easy to follow.  His humor is interesting.<br /><br />UPDATE: Having just completed his fourth book in this series, I must admit that I'm disappointed.  It appears that he may be running out of new and interesting topics.  In this book (the 4th in the series), he repeats the same topic or technique over and over again (e.g. exposure compensation) without really adding anything anything more - it's like he's just trying to fill pages.  It's as though he wrote this book over the weekend without much thought as to new content over the previous 3-editions.  To be fair, there are a few new topics worth reading, but I'm not sure they justify the cost of the entire book.  Too bad - looks like Scott may have joined the ranks of other good authors who are now writing more for quantity than quality.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|I am probably going to say this a lot but the animation on this movie was just outstanding.  I was amazed multiple times during the movie at the detail in the characters and in the backgrounds of the locations depicted in the scenes.<br /><br />Tintin is a young but respected reporter who will pursue a good story until it is solved and the truth is known.  While at a city market Tintin buys a beautiful model ship named the Unicorn.  It was a real three mast freighter sailed by Captain Haddock.  It was lost at sea and as rumor has it only Captain Haddock survived an attack by pirates lead by the infamous Red Rackham.  Immediately upon buying the model two men want to buy it and pay more than Tintin just paid for it.  He profoundly says no as it is his new found treasure.  Little does he know the adventure that this ship will lead him on!<br /><br />What follows is two hours of intense action in the style of Indiana Jones.  The movie is well portrayed by the CGI characters and you will get to be involved in their personalities as the animation is so good they seem real.  The mystery has villains, heroes and treasure while leading Tintin and his trusty dog Snowy into hazardous situations around the world.  Planes, ships, automobiles, and motorcycles will be used in chase scenes and battles throughout the movie.<br /><br />I know virtually nothing about the Tintin saga but the never ending action will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Spielberg has done a wonderful job of making this movie and my grandson was mesmerized by the story and action. I won't go in into the storyline at all as not to provide spoilers but I took over two pages of notes on this movie.  It was entrancing to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />My wife and grandson said it was 5 stars and I said 4 1/2.  I was a little lower as the action was almost too much at times, but it was still an enjoyable entertainment feature.  Your family will enjoy this movie as much as mine did and you should get it and watch it together with popcorn.  Make an adventure out of it as that is what this movie is all about!it together with popcorn.  Make an adventure out of it as that is what this movie is all about!

My Kindle Fire app \\"The Weather Channel\\" finds the right city.<br /><br />In addition we live in tornado country. It is not uncommon to get very bad thunderstorms and tornados often. It is nice to go to the basement with a tablet and use the radar on the map to plot the location and timing of an oncoming major storm. You don't want anything like a TV running as the lightning can be very bad, a tablet or smart phone is ideal. This app could have been 5 stars if the location and map were included.

B0070TLJCW|5.0|This series that abc has done this season is one of the best I've ever watched. I don't like being tied down to a certain time to watch a show but so thankful I can get it on streaming good job
0345529057|5.0|If you are in to fantasy writing then this series is a must.  So much thought goes into the characters and their history.  The author truly immerses you in the world.  A good read and would recommend to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games on this game are a lot of fun! some of the games are challenging, but it makes you wanna continue playing
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This series is only made better by the high audio and video quality of blu-ray. If you enjoyed the series on TV then this is a must buy. Highly recommended!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANOTHER.  THUMBS UP.  ENJOYING MY PURCHASE GREATLY! TOUCH SCREEN MAKES IT A NICE EXPERIENCE.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I haven't been tricked that I know of yet.  when I see these caution reviews it worries me.  If I don't know how to play I'm so scared Ill B chrgd that sometimes I just get rid of the app.  Authors need to make it less tricky.  I don't like sneaky, dishonest.  Games are for relaxing, not having to worry about your every move.  That's what casinos are for.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Got into straight away and hard to put down. Easy to read and gripping story .... Loved the characters and the way she developed them. Can't wait to get into the second book
B00004D35R|5.0|It is incredible some people love to hate the film because of Madonna or they complain abotu not being excatly like the broadway production...people chill.  the film and soundtrack are amazing, the acting epic and directing, well its an epic film all around.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very good.  The lesson plans are easy to follow. The reminder feature is handy.  The only problem is that you need an Internet connection to use.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app. it is a must to have a daily weather report that is reliable and accurate when u live in Louisiana! one day cold, next hot, then thunderstorms out of nowhere. now i sm able to send my children to school prepared for the surprise weather! even better, it was free!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|it will NOT install, and why the heck is it such a HUGE app??? I'm sure there's no legitimate reason this is the biggest app i've ever downloaded.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I found nothing wrong with the Kindle book.  I didn't particularly enjoy the Night Circus, but it was one chosen by my book club.  It was not the fault of Kindle.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is an amazing series. Anyone who even remotely likes zombies should get this series. This is a very reasonable price and you will not be disappointed in this series. It has action, adventure, mystery, and so much more. This show always keeps you guessing and on your toes. This is by far my favorite series ever. Give this series a chance you will not regret it.
B0041X90D0|3.0|I liked this album when I was a teenager. The cd. version, remastered does not diminish it. Its just that although this is probably the 2nd best T.Rex album it was never really that great. I can listen to other glam rockers like Mott the Hoople or David Bowie and in the case of one, the music is fun sometimes great and in the case of the other, the insignia of glam rock is a misnomer. Bowie was and is a genius. Mott made one of the finest rock albums of all time with All the Young Dudes. Marc Bolan and T.Rex made the undeniable classic Electric Warrior and everything seemed to go downhill from there.<br />  The remastering is fine on this album but its not a matter of comparing this to Mott the Hoople All the Young Dudes or anything by Bowie, just compare the material to Bolan's own Electric Warrior. This criticism aside, I still enjoy this cd. Any T.Rex fan own it. Then go out and purchase all the Bowie/Mick Ronson collaborations from 70-74 and Mott the Hoople's All the Young Dudes and even Hoople and Mott.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I just recently got this CD. It brought back lots of great memories. It got here quickly and in great condition. Only thing wrong with it was a small crack in the case probably due to the shipping. Still a great CD definately worth the money. Very reasonable pricing as well.
1451648537|5.0|My husband recommended this book to me. When I started reading this book,  I could not keep it down. The book is very well written and provides interesting overview of Steve's life. There is a lot to learn from this book too whether you want to learn that or not - is a choice you will have to make !
B004ZQRJH2|5.0|This is an awesome album to get for any Eminem fan. Royce da 5'9 is also a great artist. He has great rhythem and flow. The beats are sick. This is a great album to get for any rap fan. This is one album to get that definately will not disappoint. Pricing is very good and some of the tracks have been in new movies. Great album and definately worth the money.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Her last couple of novels were not as good as her first 3 Shopaholic novels.  This was clever and entertaining.  I loved it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love all the story games: Bakery and farm story included. Addictive and oh so cute! Feel free to add me as a friend :) Wolfesmom.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book, much like the rest of the series, is an amazing read! The character and plot development will keep you riveted from the beginning to the end.
0385737955|5.0|I love this trilogy!  I actually haven't read The Death Cure yet, but the first two books of this series I loved.  At first I actually thought it would be too \\"kiddie\\" because it is considered \\"young adult\\".  But I was immediately drawn to the story.<br /><br />It is because of this book that I have started reading more \\"young adult\\", dystopian fictions, and it seems like books in that genre are better.. LOL.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a good book. Must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a wonderfully easy read. Though it is somewhat predicatable, it is a fun read that will make you want to keep reading. I can't wait to read the next two books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good way to pass some time waiting for an appointment or get through a sleepless night. games are pretty easy.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|what a terrible app. I don't what people are talking about they give this a five star.  waste of time
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun, simple to use. Keystrokes are reduced with superior programming.  I will try other MobilityWare products. Great job, looking forward to many hours of play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow!!!  I had heard great things about this series, but I had NO idea just how spectacular they truly are.  I could not put this book down and I'm already going on the next one.
1400052181|4.0|I really didn't expect to like this book given the subject matter.  But the author presented in a way that didn't make it too scientific and put a personal touch to it.  This story about HeLa is not about cells that don't die and have multiplied on and on for years and years. It is the story behind the woman whom the cells belonged to.  A person who never got the recognition she deserved.  This is a story about a patient's lack of rights - long before there ever where HIPPA laws. It was a fast read for me and I am glad I decided to download this book to my kindle.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|unlike some reviews I'm not upset about having to unlock games. That's fine. if only the games were better. some are good, and others are just awful. overall, I cant give it more than 3 stars.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I do not usually write reviews for an app, but among five seconds of getting this amazing, beautiful app, I was like WHAT THE HECK ARE THE OTHER REVIEWERS  THINKING?!?!?! It takes up a lot of space because its glorious, get it. :)
B000BBYMA2|1.0|Read the novel and the manga and loved them both. The movie however was just not good. Of course it is hard to compress several phone book sized volumes into a 120 minute movie, but realize that the bulk of the material in the manga and the novel were not the killings but the back story for each character. It is the experiences (and traumas) of each character that gave us the context of the decision to kill or not kill that each one made. It is not enough to simply show killings without showing us the motivations behind them. Of course they all kill because they don't want to be killed, but without knowing whether they enjoyed doing it is part of the information conveyed in the manga and novel. This is what made us connect with each character.<br /><br />In the novel and manga, it was the \\"match ups\\" that kept one's attention. Would the martial artist be able to beat a cold blooded killer? Would the beautiful vixen be able to seduce all guys to death? Would the athletic girl be able to fight off a stronger but undisciplined guy, would the semi-trained veteran be able to out maneuver the psycho? All of these were lost in the movie and we end up with kids that don't look, or act any differently from each other. Yes, these are teens and they would not know how to hold a gun, or shoot, or even to survive in the open, but even the main (evil) characters appear to move foolishly.<br /><br />In the novel and in the manga, the wrapping up of the story is nicely done, like a twist in a mystery novel; in the movie it is boiled down to a \\"hurry up and let's finish this before we run out of tape\\" kind of deal.<br /><br />All in all, I think I will just pretend that the movie never happened.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|Tha album is really good and even though I don't like Miley Cyrus, hers is the best cover of any Dylan song on the album.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The series is phenomenal (and true to the book, as others have noted).  Rivals Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, it's that good.  Don't doubt it.  There are plenty of other rave reviews to convince you on here.<br /><br />The real reason for me to write this review is for the sake of those with a blu ray player that has trouble with the apparently overly complex menu system.  A lot of folks are having trouble even getting the discs to load, especially on the later discs.  It is not confined to any one brand machine, though some do better than others, and it seems inconsistent at that (you're not guaranteed to have trouble with these discs).<br /><br />It appears the workaround is to load up disc 1 and then choose the episode you want from there; it asks for the appropriate disc and you eject disc 1 and insert the one you really wanted to watch.  It's a bit of a pain, but it seems to work, and it beats the heck out of waiting on and on, staring at a black screen wondering if the disc you want will load up on the first, third, or fourth try or at all.  Actually takes far less time, even after waiting through the HBO ads I can't seem to skip at the start of disc 1.<br /><br />That stated, I still give this set a 5-star review, because even with this annoying flaw, it's still that good.  And beautiful on blu.  Do not hesitate to purchase this set--the extra features on the blu ray set are just as well done.  Rarely do the extras turn out to be so integral to an experience, and rarely do they meet, let alone exceed, your expectations.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this set; just use the menu from disc 1 to load all other episodes on the rest of the set, and you're all good.  (Actually, once you have a disc running, you can choose any other episode on that disc from that disc's menu without going back to disc 1; it's getting the darn things to load up initially that is the issue.)<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone who has been frustrated or was wary because of hearing the discs were buggy or something.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series is much more than just your average run of the mill fantasy. Packed with betrayal; intrigue, battle and human events, this book covers it all!
0375842209|5.0|For this one I feel I must start from the beginning.  I purchased this book a while ago when I found it on a list of WWII fiction.  Time and time I tried to start it but I couldn't get going.  I couldn't figure out what was going on and soon abandoned it.  I never thought it was a bad book or anything, I just wasn't sure if I'd like the style and wasn't convinced I could handle it for the entirety of the book.  Then I started book blogging and saw positive review after positive review.<br /><br />Then came the Holidays and a well-deserved break.  I decided that this was the time for The Book Thief and it was just so fitting.  Though the book starts off a little off-kilter, it quickly settles down and I settled in for a wonderful read.  This is a story of many stories centered around Liesel, her best friend Rudy, and her foster family.  We see them get into and escape scrapes.  They also have to face the reality of war.<br /><br />Give it a few pages before giving up on it.  This is not the type of book where you turn page after page in anticipation.  This story and the wonderful writing is something you savor.  I often found myself pausing and rereading.  There is just so much impact.  It will make you laugh out loud, it might make you cry, but it will certainly make you think (but not too much).  I loved the characters but I loved hearing the story told Death most of all.  Having the story told from his point of view is pure genius.  His observations during a great war cannot be matched.  Liesel is so spunky and Rudy touched my heart.  Everything is just so creative.<br /><br />At the end I felt like this was a story unlike any other.  I couldn't help but be impressed by Mr. Zusak's imagination.  It can be an emotional read.  It isn't too serious for the most part but it can be sad.  I felt like I knew Liesel at the end of the story.  I felt like I understood her.  When I close this book, I felt like I had lost a friend or two.  I as just that connected to the story and the characters.  It is simply wonderful.
B0049VZ222|1.0|What can you expect from the walking dead? Well you can expect zombies for about 2 minutes of the show, than the rest is people sticking their face in each other's comfort zone and grunting off bad soap oprea-esque dialogue, frequent amounts of children acting cute, and Mexican cholo's with hearts of gold. Proceed at your own risk.
0062112430|5.0|Quick-Thoughts: Love. Eloquent. Sweet.<br />Delirium is a sweet story that starts a bit slow but by the end it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding.  Here we find Lena who is months away from the procedure that will cure her of the disease that has been identified as love.  Surprisingly, Lena believes in the society, and although she has fears of pain or of something going wrong, she looks forward to getting the cure.  I found this a bit unexpected, but it is one of the things that allowed me to disappear in the story.  The world-building is thorough while leaving much to explore in future reads.  I wouldn't call the ending a cliff-hanger because there seems to be a clear resolution of sorts though it broke my heart a little bit.  I will be looking forward to Pandemonium.  Read this if you are interested in a sweet romance and a very interesting take on love.

0425241505|5.0|Pia cannot believe that she finds herself stealing from a dragon.  After being blackmailed by her boyfriend, her Ex boyfriend, Pia is forced to step outside of the shadows to preserve the life she has carefully constructed.  She knew she wouldn't likely be able to run from Dragos but she found herself in a rock and a hard place.  Dragos is torn between disbelief that someone had the audacityto steal from and him and delight that this event has torn him from his monotonous routine.  He sets out to find the thief and find out how she managed such a feat.<br /><br />I won this book in a giveaway and it has been sitting on my shelf for a while collecting dust.  Then I saw a review on Jade from Sort of Beautiful that made me say, \\"Hey! I think I have that book.  Let me take a look.\\"  Then I got busy and I was on another blog the other day (sorry I forgot who) and I read a review and remember commenting that I would start this one next.  And I did.<br /><br />I really really enjoyed this book because I loved every single character that touched the page.  Dragos made me laugh out loud.  While he is very old, he comes across as a bit innocent or naive to the ways of people and it makes for some hilarious moments.  While Dragos was my favorite, I enjoyed Pia, Rune, and all the others.  The characters just made for a very good read.  Though I had an idea how everything would ultimately end, many secrets were revealed throughout the book and I was often taken by surprise.  I can't wait to read the other character's stories, especially Runes.  I should also mention that this book is Hot. Hot. Hott!<br /><br />That said I recommend this to people who like hot Paranormal reads with lots of fun banter.

0671646788|5.0|This is the book that Lou Holtz (college football coaching legend) read in the late 60s after he fell into a depression (after losing his job). His wife gave him this book. Shortly after reading it, he wrote down 107 life goals and as of 2006, he crossed off 102 of those goals.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|So many different aspects of life are dealt with in the book.  Could not put it down! A really good read for anyone, the book is just so different and could even be true to life.

0439023513|3.0|I've thought about writing this review for a while.  The plot bothered me- it didn't feel like it was telling a story, things didn't make sense, it felt like, well, \\"food and circuses\\".  Except we were the only audience.  Many questions went unanswered, which actually did not bother me.  I don't need every detail.  What bothered me more was the questions that went unasked.  They spend months in this sanctuary, where there is more knowledge, and while it turns out more a dystopia than utopia at no point are key questions asked.  My question was, what else?  What else survived?  North America isn't the globe, what happened to the rest of the world?  Why doesn't anyone even entertain the idea of refuge in South America or Europe?  Of the possibility they are more put together, that they can more readily render aid?<br /><br />A lot of opportunities were missed to tell a good story.  We aren't shown what happens, it is relayed to us.  What made the first two books so powerful was they did not rely on this crutch.  I understand she is insulated, ill, and traumatized.  This might excuse some of it, but not all of it.  At the end of the book there is a major turinng point in the novel, and she is shut out from it when there is absolutely no reason for the author not to have written her into the event aside from not wanting to write it.<br /><br />But this wasn't even what really bothered me.  What bothered me the most is that Katniss, one of the most powerful young women I've encounter in fiction recently, was disempowered.  In the entire book the only decisions she makes are self centered or impulsive.  She's more a pawn in this book than she was in the games, any growth she made is thrown out and blamed on physical or emotional trauma.  We have a window into her mind yet we don't hear her debating, weighing the gravity of her choices.  She is angry and spiteful.  Even the choice between Peeta and Gale isn't hers to make.  I understand this for part of the book, even themajority of the book.  But I do not think she was that broken.  I don't think the other characters were that broken, either, to loose their personalities like they did.<br /><br />I am hoping the movies can flesh out the story more, fill in the details, fix some of the inconsistencies.  I don't need closure or a happy ending (I actually do think the ending of the book is happy, all things considered), but I do need the story to make sense and honor the characters personalities rather than carving them out like hollow caricatures..  A disjoined narrative is one thing, a narrative that is so lost in winding loops and focuses more on food and flashy ways to die than people and telling a story is another.  I think this book falls short of the greatness it could have achieved.  I don't know if that's because SC felt rushed, or she didn't have enough pages to tell the story (I noticed this book was the exact same length as chasing fire- did scholastic give her a page limit?).  But I think she must know that this could have been so much better than it was.
B000ID1J0E|4.0|After all these years and multiple viewings, this movie still provides near non-stop  four-fingered shots of craziness in movie-watching entertainment. When you ask the question \\"Oh no, can there really be more?\\" and the answer you want is \\"Yes\\", then this is the show for you. On top of all that there is the deep social commentary on the death of the 60's movement of social change. Captures the insanity rather well.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I uploaded this app for free.  Good thing...<br /><br />The issue I have here is that each time I've opened the app throughout the day, it shows the time and location...&quot;n/a&quot; for current temp and forecast.  Useless.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|A really good movie.  Well worth watching. A thriller with an exciting ending. Watched movie in front of the fireplace on my birthday.  Everyone enjoyed the movie so much that we talked about the movie the rest of the night.
159514188X|5.0|I starting reading this book at 11am yesterday morning and had finished it by 7pm last night... I did take a lunch break but other than that the book kept me enthralled the entire time!  Amazing read!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I was curious about the books because of the movie (which I found a bit disappointing, but my kids had a blast with).<br />Even thought I bought the book for my son, I found the story fascinating story to read. You just can't put the book down!<br /><br />There is also some educational value to this book as it contains information about Greek/Roman mythology that is fun to learn about.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is a school of thought that we are makers of our own chaos and destruction. Somewhere down the road, all the advances in technology we achieve and the moral decay of civilization will be the cause our downfall. No one can see that far into the future though--by what devices we undo ourselves or when the decline of man may happen, if it even does. However, in the post-apocalyptic story Wool by Hugh Howey something does and has happened. Knowing exactly what and why is half the battle.<br /><br />People have survived for generations in a world lived in the confines of a 140-story silo built underground. Dreams of the outside are now a distant memory in the minds of those born and raised within steel. The only reminders of such a place is the view; picture displays beamed in from sensors beyond the airlock of just what out there had become over the many years. Dark, bleak, and isolated. Why has it turned out this way? What really happened? To question these things is taboo and considered criminal.<br /><br />Very criminal.<br /><br />What was once just a standalone novella has turned into a complete first arc of a much larger science fiction story. Hugh Howey has created a world within a world that has withered away by our own hands with each release of the four other parts of the Omnibus Edition. I was deeply impressed by the characterization of the people within the Silo, individuals with their own struggles of realization and disbelief. You reach for the truth shrouded in darkness alongside them. You gasp for knowledge just as they do. You endure with them every step of the way.<br /><br />Within each part, the chapters are split among the characters who possess a distinct voice. You are allowed to see through their eyes and piece together what is unraveling before them. While there are many perspectives, a female protagonist named Juliette arises from the deep and takes central stage. She does not become apparent at first because the initial short story was never meant to be fleshed out. So, from the praise and demand written by readers that the author must continue, a heroine was born. And a strong one at that.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this. Honestly, I can't really express just how vivid the world and the characters were for me. It seems silly, but I've probably developed a lady crush on Juliette. Strong, cool, collected, smart, a tinkerer -- a different kinda geek, but a geek to me all the same. I almost leapt out of my chair after finding out that this story is possibly getting a TV/Movie offer. All I can say is Jewel Staite for Juliette. Jewel Staite, Hugh. Jewel Staite.<br /><br />This was probably one of the best things I've come across so far in my reading career. The Wool series have become a favorite of mine and I'm definitely a fan of the author now. I secretly wish that he could sign my copy of his book, but I think it's rather hard to personalize a Kindle Edition. Great work, Mr. Howey.<br /><br />Looking forward to #6!
031250926X|5.0|I didn't have a clue that the book was so popular when I bought it, I just thought it was a beautiful book but it has quickly become my speech delayed son's favorite book and he is making great strides \\"reading\\" it, he has it almost memorized now and with that creating a longer sentence than any other time. The rhyme and rhythm of the book is just beautiful and the slide and find windows make it that much more interesting to my son as well as good for his finger dexterity. This is a must have for any young child and a pleasure for parents to read to their children. Highly recommend!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the most poorly written book I have ever read.  I made it to 53% on my kindle and stopped.  I was so irritated by the repetition and horrible writing that I couldn't bear to have anyone make money off this book, so I returned it to amazon.  I was a big fan of Twilight and Hunger Games, so I don't require a whole lot to please me when it comes to writing skills...but this one actually feels like it made me more stupid just reading it.  Terrible, terrible book.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I purchased this item in 2008 and am now writing a review because I feel that I can give an honest opinion of this item after two long years. I can say that I highly recommend this product over any other third party controllers simply because of the ease of use and the ergonomics of it all. I have tried some other third party controllers and they just don't feel right to me. Some would even lose connection and I would have to readjust it so it would connect to the system again.<br /><br />I've never had any problems with original Sony controllers, and I have 4 of them now. I cannot stress enough how much I love this controller and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new or replacement controller for their PS3.

He is one of those guys that won't let something go until he really understands it and can explain it well.<br /><br />Lean is constantly evolving and being refined and not everyone will do it the same way, but if you want to get your effort kick started then in my opinion this is by far the best volume written so far, and I have read them all.<br /><br />If you have been in software, especially at a management level for more than 10 years a lot of what is said will make perfect sense to you since much of what lean tries to address is the common failures seen over and over again in any start-up effort.<br /><br />I also appreciate that Ash ( and most other real world participants ) do not think in dogmatic terms about what works and what doesn't.  For instance you will see a lot of shallow swimmers in the lean world tell you that surveys suck, and to never use them (because someone told them that)  Ash on the other hand has a more pragmatic approach.<br /><br />Qualitative (get out of the building) interviews during customer dev are a must and are non-negotiable. But quantitative approaches to validate your discoveries ( like properly constructed surveys or analytics ) work naturally as the next step to provide some statistical backbone.<br /><br />Relative to all of the other material out there I can easily say this is a five star book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. I like to know what it's like out in the morning and this tells me. It's accurate and it's right at my fingertips, and you can't beat the price.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I just have one observation, it's very hard to make out the details of the small print with the backgrounds provided.  All I want is a way to have the information on a plain black background.  If there's a setting for that I haven't found it.
0071762345|5.0|Concise, easy to understand and helps demystify social media with practical action points.  It's a bit US orientated in terms of examples but it's still relevant if say like me you're from the UK with a European role.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|with no real controls and a lot of puzzles and mystery this is my favorite game by far.. must get it!
B00632HWOG|1.0|When I tried to get this app I couldn't. That made me frustrated because they wanted me to give my credit card number to pay for it when they said it was free. I tried to get it but couldn't so I just gave up and stuck with the way my Yahoo was already. Hope this was helpfull.<br />  Sincerely,<br />  A Yahoo Member
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I became totally immersed in this series...I devoured book 1 and on to the next I went. There is something about these characters that pull you in and hold you there. I am not generally a reader of torrid sex books and the sex in this book is the least of what draws me to it. I want my very own Christian Grey...the character cast a spell on me from the beginning.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|It is just a stupid app idea and don't think stuff like this should be available on market place cause what if someone like me is offended by other religions books on the market place i can understand if ot was on the book store but not the market place its a stupid book and a stupid app
0439023521|5.0|OMG this trilogy is one of the best I have ever read.  I highly recommend all three.  I literally could not put the books down.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Its dumb. Not worth your time. They are just stupid videos that random people put on. DO NOT GET IT!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I have all the Gilmore Girls Series and have watched them so many times that I needed to replace my Second Season. My transaction was quick and DvDs were in great condition as stated. I was extremely happy with the seller of my product! And obviously would highly recommend the Gilmore Girls.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It is Lot's of fun! I like it a lot! I like beating the goals. The arcade mode is my favortie but yeah... it's fun.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|This app is pretty and so far I really like it. I was looking for a second weather app to compare with TWC and I think this one will fill the bill. Don't know what others complaints are about...I have no problems with size or anything. Heck. it's free, give it a try.<br />PS I only gave it 4 stars b/c I wish it had more features.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app. It saves me so many keystrokes and the predictions are almost eerie. Like someone crawled inside my brain. So much better than the standard keyboard for the phone. You won't be disappointed.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|this is better than the lite obviously and I especially like how there is re runs of any kind of news, there is so many radio stations and the best part, its only 50&cent;.  I have I heart radio but only for one reason.  the Elvis Durand show.  I'm never awake for it so I love the re run!!!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I wanted to give it a try before reviewing. At the end, I agree with the other reviews, nice looks and that's all. Not worth it.<br />You'd better off using Superman75 approach.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It helps me a lot. its all clear and easy to use. its very simplistic. thank you for making this.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Well made movie. Developed backgrounds for Kirk and Spock extremely well.  Kirk is seen as a much greater risk taker in his younger days.  Spock is close to his parents and after subsequent events, Kirk.
B002Q9VPFM|4.0|I ordered this film a bit ago, and I must say that it was definitely worth it! Here's some categories for what the actual case consists of:<br /><br />CASE- The bloody smiley button with a Jolly Roger on it in place of the smiley face for the front cover (the Jolly Roger is for Tales of the Black Freighter, which is seen in Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut) and a picture of the case completely opened on the back cover with all the features neatly listed. On the inside of the case, three discs and two flaps open up to reveal the main part of the case, and a second case can be pulled out to reveal Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comics.<br /><br />DISC ONE- Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut version of the original film (Director's Cut scenes and Tales of the Black Freighter) and Audio Commentary with Zack Snyder (director) and Dave Gibbons (graphic novel artist) during the film.<br /><br />DISC TWO- The Phenomenon: The Comic that Changed Comics; Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes; Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World; Watchmen: Video Journals; Music Video for \\"Desolation Row\\" by My Chemical Romance; Under The Hood; and Story Within A Story: The Books of Watchmen.<br /><br />DISC THREE- Digital copy of theatrical version of Watchmen.<br /><br />WATCHMEN: THE COMPLETE MOTION COMICS- A separate case in the larger case containing Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comics, Parts 1 and 2 (interactive reading of the graphic novel for Watchmen). Contains two discs, each with a part of the graphic novel.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say about this product is that the Ultimate Cut version of Watchmen is EXTREMELY LONG!!! In fact, the only two movies I've ever seen that even come close to it in length are King Kong (2005) at just over 3 hours and Avatar: Extended Collector's Edition at about 2 hours and 45 minutes! Even though this is an absolutely fantastic film, it's probably not a good idea to start it at 11:00 at night unless you plan on being up until 3:00 in the morning, because this is a 3 1/2 hour-long flick.<br /><br />That and the fact that the only version of the film in the case is the Ultimate Cut, meaning you're going to have to watch all 325 minutes of the film unless you want to skip through it.<br /><br />Other than those two minor details, this is THE version of the film Watchmen to get. It's fairly cheap, has the true version of the film, lots of extras and goodies inside, and a pretty kickass case!<br /><br />So, if you want my advice, here it is: BUY IT!!!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|The product was in great condition. All three disc worked wonderfully and just as described in your listing. Fast shipping. My daughter was very happy to have this added into her princess collection. Thank you for offering such a wonderful price on this movie.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|46 mb is way to large for a weather app, the animation is cool though. no widget for a weather app is a big prob...
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Thank you for the opportunity to add this great movie to my collection at such a wonderful price. Shipping was fast and product was just as described. Thanks again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing story! I am in my 50's and this book is for teens but I loved the story. I could not stop reading because I had to read to the end.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|well this game is totally fun but sometimes it gets on my nerve when u try to get a highscore.some levels r way to hard. but overall this game is fun. I recommend this for all family members. my mom sometimes snatches my kindle fire to just play herself( lol)!!!!!!!!!!! .;)))))))/. this is why I give this a 4 stars :-) ok bye why r u still reading this jk. GET THIS APP PS BUY THE HAWK ITS AWSOME&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003K16P3M|4.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was engaging from the beginning and had an interesting plot.  One thing I liked about this book is that it kept me guessing.  There were some plot twists that I didn't see coming, and I found that refreshing.<br /><br />I loved most of the characters (Po, Bitterblue, Raffin), but I had trouble liking Katsa.  I tried to remember that she was raised without parents and as a weapon; she did not have a parental figure that loved her.  However, it was still hard for me to like her.  Even though I did not particularly like Katsa all of the time, I understood her opinions and motivations and learned to respect them.  The other characters kept me reading.  I had to find out what happened to Po and to Bitterblue.  I cannot wait to read Bitterblue when it comes out later this year.<br /><br />Overall, I thought that the book was well written, but some of the stylistic choices bothered me.  There were a lot of fragments in the book which made it harder for me to understand.  I kept having to read back over them.  If grammar doesn't bother you, then this shouldn't be a problem.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Even if you did not see the movie, the soundtrack is really great.  The songs and music are smooth and great easy listening.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|good book. nicely written but i hate the ending.it is like a disaster book and everybody dies. some of the most important deaths were unneccesary. but i like everying else about the book.
0439023491|1.0|My god in 46 years I never read such a boring book. I read the reviews and they must be reading a different book. I would have thrown it away after the first chapter but I had either this book or the yellow pages to read. (It was a close thing)<br />Of the 500 pages, the first 300 are all about Katniss and her hair and her clothes, and the reviews call this heart stopping...breathtaking....well I guess if you are fashion desginer it might be as regards \\"thriller\\"...<br /><br />Then there are 100 pages of slight excitment of the fighting between the groups.<br /><br />I was hoping the heroine , Katniss, would get killed off because she was the most annoying of the whole lot.<br /><br />What a waste of money.<br /><br />How can stephen King put that this is \\"Unstoppable\\"......
B004Y1USV2|3.0|Jons not there, oh well, neither is Rick, oh well. Face it Yes as a creative entity has been over since they fired Patrick Moraz right after Relayer. Going For The One was good and Tormato wasn't, but neither was a step forward. I suppose 90125 was but was that band really Yes? No more or less than this one as far as I'm concerned. The revolving door of players has taken its toll on my patience and on my being able to give a damn. So I bought this cd and I found it enjoyable. Is it prog rock? Not if prog rock actually means progressive rock, meaning music that moves forward, is adventurous, has an aim and is engaged in elevating rock above the realm of pop commercialism and cliche. For contemporary musicians doing just that I'd recommend Deerhoof, TuneYards, Radiohead, Bat For Lashes, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Tombs, Magma, King Crimson (retired?) or Scott Walker. Maybe even Animal Collective, Ween, Enslaved or Flaming Lips, but certainly not Yes. Yes gave up breaking new ground almost 30 years ago. This album is no exception. Is it great? No. Does it sound like previous Yes records? Yes, kinda. Anderson is missed, I like his voice a lot and Benoit David is a bit stiff by comparison. Do I miss Wakeman? Nope. He's most likely a great guy to have a pint with but his musical contributions with this band have been spotty since 1973, though I liked Going For The One, the studio parts of Keys To Ascension, and even Tormato. Fly From Here is pleasant music. Its not challenging, it breaks no new ground, but I like it. Its the musical equivalent of comfort food and cinematic in its sound and feel. I really don't expect much anymore from these musicians and they haven't disappointed me. So the reeking buns of Angel (Yes) don't smell like cocaine to me (anymore). Not that there's anything wrong with that. Thanks to Frank Zappa.
B0056HTEC2|4.0|Hugh Laurie may not have the best voice, but he has the voice of the Blues. The music selection is terrific! There are songs with which you are familiar and some you may not know. In any case, this is an enjoyable CD and is highly recommeded.
B005TF07WM|5.0|Great download I just wished it worked on android tablets as of now I can only watch online. Amazon needs to update
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|It doesn't automatically find your location, and I cannot figure out how to change to my location.  Using it on my Nook Tablet.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|There's no widget to place on the home screen. You have to go into the app, then you can configure another 'weather home screen'. Yeah...not very convenient. Many other weather apps out there that do more. I would have been asking for a refund if I paid.
B006OV7S1I|5.0|I will not go into depth. I feel that this movie is better left for the viewer to decided if they liked it or not.<br /><br />On a non-movie standpoint, the product shipped fast and was exactly as described.<br /><br />Short opinion of film: Captivating. This movie has a lot beneath the surface. I like how the story goes against the normal grain (Main character regresses vs. progresses). Many themes are apparent while watching MMMM and they are so well blended.<br /><br />To be honest, the first time I saw the ending, I was not a huge fan of it however, after I had reflected on the film for a day or so, I decided that I would not want to change it for the world.<br /><br />Give it a chance-- support this film and buy it. You will not be sorry.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|After reading about the awards and the reviews, you get a little concerned that the book isnt going to live up to the praise -- i'm a cynic... the book is just really fantastic.<br /><br />The character development is rich for both main characters and small bits.  The detail with which the author tells his tale is spot on -- it's not gruesomely detailed (which is a concern with a 500+ novel) and none of it seemed superfluous.  Speaking of big words -- there are alot of them -- thank heaven for the dictionary feature in kindle.  I guess the only other barrier that one may have with this book is the reference to gods and mythology, etc. -- it's  woven so simply into the story that even the most anti-sci-fi person will still enjoy.<br /><br />i probably wont jump to his other novels next week -- but they are definitely on my wish list.
B00005JGAB|5.0|This is an absurd classic by one of the bands that REALLY change the ways of music history...I don´t know which band created punk rock, but certainly was the RAMONES that registrated  it!!! This debut is reeeeeally bad produced by a young ramone band, but there are so many classics here..... JUDY IS A PUNK, BEAT ON A BRAT, BLITZKRIEG  BOP....MAN, and it´s soooooo RAW!! What can i say...It´s the RAMONES debut....CLASSIC!!!!!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book was a great read. Would definitely recommend to men and women alike.  The book ended rather abruptly - leaving me to want to know more. I plan on reading more from this author - very interesting.
B000001ES9|5.0|RUSH's debut got some great songs like FINDING MY WAY, WHAT YOU´RE DOING and WORKING MAN ...This is really different from the sound RUSH begin to do with Neil Peart on the drums and lyrics...Especially the lyrics are very distint, and Geddy's vocals sound like a young Robert Plant...But is a great rock album, and the first one by the lords of RUSH!!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|After using 3 other apps, including The Weather Channel, this app has been the best.  You can have weather alerts sent to your phone, the map is great, you can have the temp in your taskbar, can add 10 locations...and is 8MB compared to the 10MB of The Weather Channel.  Working great on my G2.  Thank you, AccuWeather!
1426308469|5.0|i  bought this book for my 4 yr old, who is all into Dinos.. Loved it.. Plenty of awesome facts but kid friendly with pics
B004LROMQG|5.0|We got this from a public library.  We love it and recommend our local library to order it.  Our kids watched and laughed over and over several times before we have to return it.  Some people got the wrong region here.  We will ask the library to see where they get it.  So we will own the correct region.  The story is getting better and better each ep.
B006ON41FC|5.0|best game for android phone, hours of enjoyment, addictive and fun, great graphics, really well made game. Would recommend it to all my friends and family!!! A ++++
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I enjoyed this series before E. B. Sledge took over the story. In the first episodes it highlights a Marine named J. Baselone ( forgive me if I misspelled his name) His story is one of amazing courage, honor and self sacrifice. The story then takes up with the so-called diary of Eugene Sledge. A story by a man that saw nothing except horror and dishonor in his fellow marines. Others must have written about the war. It' too bad they chose Mr Sledge as their source of information. A Band of Brothers left me with a feeling of pride while showing the horrors of war. The Pacific shows the horrors of war but left me feeling I needed to take a shower. Eugene, the son of a wealthy doctor, went on to become an alcoholic while his less fortunate friend, Sid Phillips, (who wished he could help the wounded at Guadalcanal) came back to become a doctor. I would rather have had the story continue with someone that came back from the war with the drive to improve his life and help others than someone who came back with a drive to drink.<br />This series IS NOT for those who know history and the story of these man.
B0079J28NC|5.0|\\"Yellow Submarine\\" is one of those movies that, for me, is pure nostalgia. It was my first introduction to the Beatles, and one of the first non-Disney animated movies I saw.<br /><br />Even though it makes absolutely no sense, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is still a delightfully weird, acid-tripping story that bounces all over a colorful galaxy of hallucinatory nonsense. And yes, it stars the Beatles as heroes riding around in a Yellow Submarine, seeking to defeat the Blue Meanies. No joke.<br /><br />Under the sea, there is an idyllic land known as Pepperland, where music rules. But then the music-hating Blue Meanies invade, petrifying the people with green apples and sealing away St. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Fortunately Old Fred the sailor manages to escape in a yellow submarine, to find help.<br /><br />He finds it in Liverpool, where he enlists the depressed Ringo, and subsequently Ringo's four buddies John, Paul and George. So the yellow submarine sets out to Pepperland, but encounters many strange dangers along the way -- the Sea of Time, the Sea of Science, a monstrous vacuum, giant stomping boots, the Foothills of the Headlands (which is full of giant heads), the \\"nowhere man\\" in his \\"nowhereland,\\" and the mind-bending Sea of Holes.<br /><br />But when they get to Pepperland, they find a ruined shell ruled over by the Nazi-like Blue Meanies. Can the Beatles elude petrification/capture, and somehow manage to bring music back to Pepperland?<br /><br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\" has almost no story, and the dialogue often makes little sense. This is a movie that is all about the visuals -- colorful, wild, acid-tripping visuals that seem to be trying to dazzle your eyes. It's a world filled with sea-anemone trees, flowers, patterns, giant grimacing teeth, a flying glove, time travel, stomping boots and strange puffballs with faces.<br /><br />Seriously, it's like someone fed LSD to Dr. Seuss and Terry Gilliam at once, then told them to make a movie about whatever they saw. It's awesome.<br /><br />Most of the story involves the Beatles careening wildly from one bizarre, surrealist world to another. The animators didn't make any effort to make anything seem normal, even in the real world -- for instance, John Lennon is introduced as Frankenstein's monster, who drinks a potion that poofs him into his human form. \\"Hey Ringo. I've just had the strangest dream,\\" he says casually.<br /><br />And they do a pretty good job of integrating the various Beatles songs into the story. For example, the time-bending \\"Sea of Time\\" leads to a rendition of \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" -- although some, like \\"Lucy i the Sky With Diamonds,\\" just sort of pop out of nowhere.<br /><br />Don't watch it for the story -- \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is all about the Beatles songs and the dazzlingly colorful visuals. A must-see for animation fans and/or fans of surrealism.aw. It's awesome.<br /><br />Most of the story involves the Beatles careening wildly from one bizarre, surrealist world to another.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|easily worthy the 99 cent price. definitely recommended.  essentially, it's just missile command, but the ability to upgrade adds some depth. and there's a reason missile command is a classic -- it's awesome.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|The books are good. (not appropriate for the recommended reader age, but still good)  However this copy has inconsistent font changes and missing pages. For what I paid.I should have downloaded each book individually. DON'T BUY THIS TRILOGY!  Get each book by itself.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|works great and looks fantastic on the kindle fire. not sure about the size complaints. makes no difference here as I have plenty of space.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|its a good app to have so uu no how and wat u should dress like in the morning. so ya
057809665X|5.0|This is a great read if you are in any business or industry where knowing people is a must.  All the techniques are very easily adaptable and the more you realize its not all about you the easier everything becomes.  Great Read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it! its frustrating sometimes and there's gamesi only play to unlock the next one but its definitely a good game and its free!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|common game and simple rules.  hard to make it complicated.  it's a good time waster but i find it hard to win, even on winning deck, but i just may suck a lot at this game.
1596432594|5.0|Shame on me. I'd heard of Richard Feynman, but didn't know that much about him. By the time I raced through this book, I felt as if I knew this warm, funny, sincere, humble and intelligent man. I also understood a little physics, too! This book is extremely well conceived--the graphic format brings out much more than a mere story of words can tell. I recommend it to everyone, science geeks or not.
B000002MIY|5.0|I could never understand why most reviewers claim that The Nightfly is a better album then Kamakiriad.  I think the songs on Kamakiriad are better written and the production value was better. In particular, the horn charts are incredible and complex and deserve their out in front mix. I fell in love with both albums in cassette format, so no difference there.  Maybe, since I was jonesing for anything Fagen/Steely Dan for 10 years, the release of Kamakiriad was the best high I ever had.
B0068TL23G|5.0|I played this for a half an hour before I realized how addictive it was. Great to pass time on. No problems running on the K-fire. Makes you think.
B00001OH7V|5.0|This album is a great listen. It is certainly not for everyone, but for me, the unique sounds, lyrics, and melodies create powerful atmosphere and touching stories. Very few albums inspire me creatively the way this album does.
1416955070|4.0|Book arrived as in promised condition, and was received in a timely manner.  It is a great series, and I needed this book to complete my series.
B006MGDIAA|5.0|This book is an absolute must-have for anyone wanting to get cracking with iOS games. It's in the perfect sweet-spot of instantly workable sample code (an absolute bargain alone for this code), and enough explanation and clarity to figure out the techniques. Cuts right through to what you need to know, gives plenty of gaming background knowledge. And the sample apps are very cool. Loads of info about 3rd party tools, an interesting chapter about speech-recognition, sound, video, animations, special effects... Great value, the author really nailed it.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|I bought into the hype on this series BEFORE I read a preview on my kindle... and I purchased the books prior to doing my research.  What regret... I wasted $30 and a weekend skimming through the story-line.  The sex was redundant... the dialog and phrasing was redundant \\"Oh My\\" \\"Holy Crap\\"... \\"my breath hitched\\".  This had to have been some of the worst writing I've ever seen. Aside from the extensive sexual content you'd believe a 9th grader had written it.  I really don't like giving poor reviews and I normally don't in regards to reading material, but if I can save just one person from wasting their time and $$... it was worth my effort.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Looks ok, but not as good as acuweather, I have an epic touch (galaxy s2) and cant figure out how to use it as a widget.... Im not retarded really, the option is just not there. Also took like 5 mins to install. And could not gind the city I live in but it found the very small hick town 5 miles away..... There is much better out there
B007J4T2G8|2.0|These books are erotica, plain and simple.  I found there to be SO much sexual content that it started to get boring... toward the end I was just skipping over all the sex to get to the meat of the story line.  Honestly, if I had to read the phrase \\"Oh My\\" one more time I probably would've poked my eyes out.  Waayyy too much of the same content.<br />The lead female character was relateable because her emotions were similar to what most women go through during their early relationships... (aside from the S & M issues).  I was hoping to finally find a story line geared toward more mature women (35+) and was disappointed that this was written about a 21/22 yr old woman.  That is my daughter's age... which made the content even more disturbing... another young women, falling in love with a rich man that flys her all over, buys her clothing and has a dark secret... next!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|at first I didn't know anything just got it as the app of the day I know its 99 cents but I would pay $2 for it and a tip is if you get stuck come back to it later and don't think too much
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. Really enjoy.  I especially like the ability to replay a deal, this way you can see if a different move makes a a losing deal a winning one. Just like playing with real cards
0393057658|5.0|I'm from Cleveland so don't hate me for hating baseball for most of my life.  I don't much like statistics either, because they are so hard to explain to a neighbor, even those stats whose discovery is so rewarding.  But MONEYBALL gave me the best view ever of those hypocrites that cite \\"the stats\\" over the radio and TV as if they really knew what they were talking about.  How refreshing to learn that the game is not only rigged, but poorly rigged and that the owners have been the greatest fools.  Shame on the business (as sport) that often would rather not hear the truth! If I laud the exposé it may also be because the taxpayers of Cleveland and other towns today are often asked to foot the bill for the owner's ignorance.  If there is a petition available for signing that would draft author Mike Lewis into the football front offices of America, I'd sign it.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the postscript, but don't read that first or you'll deprive yourself of a dessert worthy of the several-course steak dinner.  For me Lewis is reminiscent of personal detail found in David Halberstam (The Reckoning, The Powers That Be)  while sparing us the epic length of his findings.<br /><br />I like to study businesses and this book is probably the best case study of an attempt to attach accurate metrics to performance in baseball.  Now what most people want to see in baseball is all \\"Hollywood.\\"  Fancy double plays, base stealing, baseline bunts, basket catches and backhand nabs, brief, things that count for little in the scheme of winning.  If that's what you want to read about, I'd suggest you buy another ticket to the game in your town.  If you run a business though or would like to invest in one, this might not be the first book you should read about business analysis, but it is one that will add the most to your vocabulary as you seek to describe your vision of success while remaining objective about the metrics to follow within the enterprise budget.<br /><br />Again, excellent journalistic kudos to Michael Lewis.  The close-in discovery that confirms the desk research behind this book is hard to match. (It is often said that difficulty in scientific investigation is made more so because the effect of measurement changes the outcome.  That certainly happened here, but I sincerely hope that it was at the expense of \\"The Club\\" and its \\"Women's Auxiliary.\\" Again, read the postscript and enjoy...

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded this because of the hype, I admit it.  What can I say that isn't insulting.  This is poor writing.  I don't often say this, but this woman has no talent for writing.  It's fan ficton, and that's pushing it.  The protagonist has no personality.  She falls over her feet how many times to land in his arms?  And of course he has to be rich and everyone is intimidated by him. I didn't care about either of them.  This is a harlequin novel with more sex.  Repetitive,  sex that I didn't find erotic.  Read the Story of O if you want good bdsm.  Read the Marketplace Series if you want great writing with D/s.  Don't read this.  You won't get those precious hours back.
B007M6P01O|5.0|Okay...  So the ones that died I expected to die on the exception of Herschel.<br /><br />Now I feel bad for Rick how the group all of a sudden turned on him when they were all ready to settle on the farm until this whole Helicopter business came up.  At first I was wondering how the Helicopter could lead the walkers from the city to the country side.  I know it wasn't that far out of the city, but still.  My friend said once they're going you can't really turn them from their path unless maybe if they hear another sound coming from another direction.<br /><br />I think Rick keeping the secret from them about everyone being infected was justifiable since it'll probably only cause more panic or drive them nuts like Shane.  As stated above I feel bad for Rick and I think he deserves more respect than what the rest of the group is giving him including his own wife and son (minus Daryl and Herschel).<br /><br />With all of that said I am excited for the prison saga and see who this woman that saved Andrea from becoming walker chow.<br /><br />This episode took all the dullness out of season 2 and packed all the action, anxiety, nail biting (as someone said they were doing), keeping you on the edge of your seat feeling and just stuck it in this episode.  I thought Glenn was going to die just getting out of the car so he can drive since Maggie was having a temporary breakdown.  The way the camera angle was I wasn't sure if he was going to be attacked or Maggie was.<br /><br />Please be kind to us AMC and don't wait until October :(<br /><br />This finale rocked! Actually the last 3 or 4 episodes rocked!  Shane you will be missed.<br /><br />Rick I hope you don't turn into Shane or we'll have to think of you as Shrick (Shane and Rick).
B003IWRE3I|5.0|As of this writing, we are not living the horrors of a post-apocalyptic event, as portrayed in this film.  However, all of us who are parents still face the same issues, so painfully faced by this father.  What will become of our children if we are no longer able to watch out for them?  Who will really have their best interests at heart, watch out for them, and protect them, if we are unable?  The world, as it exists today, is often a cruel, terrible place with thieves, con-men, murderers and vile beasts passing themselves off as human.  Thankfully, there ARE some good people, even strangers, who will do what is right in the face of the most terrible adversity.  There are also those who will descend into the most heinous existence, doing what they must to survive regardless of the horrors they might inflict on others, even children.<br /><br />This film is absolutely outstanding, and does a great job at capturing some of the themes central to Mr. McCarthy's novel.  The acting is amazing.<br /><br />Both the novel and the movie end on a promising note, but we have to wonder if that was simply Mr. McCarthy showing a little mercy for his readers by throwing them a thin glimmer of hope.  The novel and the movie could have just as easily ended as we all feared they might.  The innocent, sweet child could have fallen into the wrong hands, and died the most terrible death.<br /><br />In our non-post apocalyptic world, people (even children) die every day as victims of another person's inhumanity.  Watch this film, not to enjoy but to reflect.  The Man says, \\"I'm trying to prepare him for when I am gone.\\"  I guess that is what all of us who love our children are trying to do.
B0078JOAOI|4.0|Hi all!<br /><br />I'm sure just like the most of you we're in anticipation of episode 13 (Season Finale).<br /><br />Does anyone know when Season 2, episode 13 is released on Amazon video?  I don't have Cable (thank goodness) and this is my only way of watching \\"The Walking Dead\\" anywhere.  I don't trust downloading it unless you can buy it and streaming from websites are kind of lame too.<br /><br />If anyone has any feed back on when Amazon is actually allowed to release the episode (i.e. after it air on TV or the following day).<br /><br />----<br />If any of you are thinking of streaming from Amazon it works just great.  There are times where it lags, but no biggie.  I gave it a four star because of that lag, but it's great if you have HIGH SPEED INTERNET and you don't want to subscribe to dish or cable.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|There is a reason I usually don't start a series/trilogy unless all the books are already published. I just can't remember stuff like I used to. I remember liking the first book, The Name of the Wind. I don't remember very many other things about it. That made getting into this book rather difficult.<br /><br />Mr. Rothfuss is an excellent writer. I found myself underlining many passages just for their beauty. He has a wonderful way with language. I really liked the characters, both large and small. I found his various cultures fascinating. Kvothe's adventures were interesting and kept me glued to the book.<br /><br />Despite all this, I feel somewhat lost. At times the stories within stories within stories were too much. I read for escapism and pleasure, not necessarily to challenge my mind. I found myself frequently wondering if I was missing connections. Was the author intending a deeper reading within this maze?<br /><br />It took two years between book 1 and book 2. I'm sure I will be just as lost when book 3 finally comes out. Hopefully I'll be able to get into the story anyway. I will read it just to experience Mr. Rothfuss's beautiful language. I wish, however, that there will be a synopsis of the first two books included at the beginning. I'm not getting any younger.
