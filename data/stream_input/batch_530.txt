B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Like the review said, great movie if you've never read the Illiad (or completely disregard it). But then again Hollywood always makes \\"historic\\" movies and then twist or completely delete certain aspects of it to fit into their vision of the film. <br /> <br />Still... it has Brad Pitt in it. :)
B0002S947K|5.0|\\"Sometimes I feel like worry is my only friend\\", so says Ray LaMontagne. <br /> <br />In Ray LaMontagne's beautiful debut CD \\"Trouble\\", the world is oft times filled with heartache and quiet longing.  But his insightful lyrics also tell us that love and faith can bring renewed hope and heal a weary soul.   This album is a stunning, visceral examination of life and the rewards it can bring.   It conjures up images of last chances and new beginnings.   In short, his lyrics paint that picture of a thousand words. <br /> <br />The music itself exhibits the many influences Ray must have certainly been exposed to on his path to the creative halls he now strides within.  \\"Shelter\\" and \\"Hannah\\" are reminiscent of certain songs by \\"The Band\\".   \\"How Come\\" has the same driving backbeat of a bluesy \\"Joe Cocker\\" tune.   In \\"Narrow Escape\\" and \\"Burn\\", Ray at times seems to be channelling \\"Ryan Adams\\". <br /> <br />Don't misunderstand, he doesn't mimic these other artists, but clearly draws from the same universal pool of creative genius that so few of we humans ever even glimpse. <br /> <br />\\"Trouble\\" as it turns out, is no trouble at all. <br /> <br />Most highly recommended!
B000002UJQ|1.0|I bought OK Computer on the back of their great single Paranoid Android but never really dug the rest of it. Besides maybe No Suprises, the rest of this is dull, unmemorable and has the most irritating vocals this side of Smashing Pumpkins. Not my cup of tea at all and to these ears, not quality art rock. I read a 'best album ever' poll recently that had this on top, which completely baffles me. Someone tell me what's so good about this album, please! :)
B0002NRRAG|4.0|I agree with all the kudos from the other reviewers. I really love this music. Just surprised that no one seemed to mention the influence and stylings of \\"Peggy Lee\\" as well as Billie Holiday in this CD.  Ms. Peyroux's voice is indeed very special. I drift off to dreamland to it every night!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I was skeptical with dance being tied into rock but P!ATD blended the two almost perfectly. This may be the most original cd I have ever heard. Go and get this today. You will not be disappointed.
B000002MTR|5.0|i know this album very well but lost my previous CD and just had to have it back <br />
B000053VAZ|4.0|Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson are the actors portraying the title characters in this wonderful movie about a brother (Benny) who is very protective of his mentally challanged adult sister (June).  Changing the lives of these two people who are muddling their way through life comes SAM played by Johnny Depp.  He connects with Joon in a way that her brother could not and they fall in love.  Funny, Sweet, and very entertaining.  The acting and writing is wonderful.  It is has heart and laughs.
B00005YU1O|1.0|I was able to sit through about fifteen minutes of this film before my mind and body were thoroughly nauseated by the tiring visual aspect.  <br /> <br />It seems as if a college student, on a tirade induced by schwag and a survey of philosophy course, decided to take a sub-mediocre film and \\"radically\\" alter its perspective by digitally filtering it. Much like a mental masturbation done with photoshop, it felt overwhelmingly devoid of meaning, and uninspiringly digital-neo-baroque. There is little content in this film of any value (though it could have potentially been an interesting intro to western thought cartoon demonstration), and even the \\"innovative\\" visual aspect is little more than a poor, uninteresting home video disguised as something greater than it really is. <br /> <br />I would save money by not renting or buying this film, acquiring some mind-altering controlled substance (not sleeping for three days will do), and roam around a college town having quasi-philosophical discussions with going-nowhere hipsters who love to hear themselves talk and take themselves very seriously. <br /> <br />To end this discussion, I have to say 1. it appears that only fans of the movie have rated it and 2. being a critically trained intellectual ruins your chances of enjoying most films.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem first made an impact on Australia when she appeared in a soap opera called Neighbours. Since then she has become the biggest pop star since Kylie Minogue. She has even surpassed old chart records that Kylie held and this album shows off her voice and writing talent. So why is it so good?<br /><br />1. Born To Try: The lead single cemented her as an artist to watch. The song was huge in the UK and raced into the top 3. This song is a great opener to this album and shows off her superb vocal range. The song really gets caught in your head.<br /><br />2. Innocent Eyes: Another single and hit but what makes this song is the reflection on her childhood. The song is rather poetic which is basically also shown throughout the whole album. The way she interprets the song is great and the chorus is really catchy.<br /><br />3. Not Me, Not I: A ballad with punch. This song shows off Delta on the whole. If you could judge her based on one song, this song would be it. The title is really good.<br /><br />4. Throw It Away: In my opinion this should have be released as a single rather than Lost Without You. This is the first guitar orientated song on the album and provides a good balance.<br /><br />5. Lost Without You: The worst single released from this album, however it is a great song and has a wicked drum beat that works well with the piano. In this song she admits that she was wrong and realizes her mistake. Overall a superb song.<br /><br />6. Predictable: One of the best songs on this album, never released with a proper video. The video has Delta live in concert. Really quite angsty and rock orientated sounds coming through on this track.<br /><br />7. Butterfly: This is a rather sympathetic song and though it isn't that strong it has a rather nice chorus. Good vocals.<br /><br />8. In My Own Time: This track is a spectacular ballad with lots of emotion. You may think that this album may be boring with all the ballads however it really isn't. The song sounds a bit country-ish.<br /><br />9. My Big Mistake: My Big Mistake sounds like it could've come off her sophomore album Mistaken Identity. The song is really fast though not crazily fast. Just fast compared to the other songs.<br /><br />10. This Is Not Me: Again Delta proves that she can write great songs and you just have to listen to this song to really love it.<br /><br />11. Running Away: This song has alot of programming at the start and is about running away. The chorus is the best on the album.<br /><br />12. A Year Ago Today: This track is a bit slow and boring and sounds a little like Will You Fall For Me but it's okay I guess.<br /><br />13. Longer: Has a great motif at the start with strings and is the last up-beat song on the album before the closing song. I really like this song for reasons I don't know. The lyrics are good.<br /><br />14. Will You Fall For Me: It is a really good song until the chorus which isn't as good as the verses. This song means alot to me and I can relate with some of the songs. Nice close.<br /><br />Innocent Eyes is a stunning piece of work, while not as good as her sophomore it sure is really amazing. This album shows why it sold 1 million copies worldwide and hopefully will show her off to the world. This is a gripping debut that will astound you.The song sounds a bit country-ish. <br /> <br />9.

B000AM4PBS|5.0|Just a note to all those worried about having bought seasons 1-9 and feeling like 10 won't be available solo.  Every other season has been available solo.  The 1-7 collection came available before Season 7 was available individually if my memory serves, and they release Season 8 and 9 individually so I have little doubt they won't do the same for Season 10.  The full collection just gives those of us who've been waiting on it a slightly better average per season cost (instead of $24-$30, we end up getting it at $21) but that is about it.  I'm ecstatic they are finally doing this, I've been holding out for this since about 2 years ago when it all ended.  Hope everyone enjoys it.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|PLOT: Recently divorced Lucy Emerson (Diane Wiest) and her two teenage sons, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim), are packing up and moving from Phoenix to Santa Carla, California (\\"the murder capital of the world\\"). They (along with their dog Nanook) are going to live with her father (Barnard Hughes), a taxidermist. Santa Carla is a summer town and the most popular place around is the board walk. One night, Michael and Sam go to the board walk to watch a live concert. Suddenly, Michael's eye is caught by a beautiful girl (Jami Gertz) in the crowd. His \\"dream girl\\" eventually leaves, so naturally he decides to try and follow her. Sam complains about having to follow Michael around, so he decides to stop at a comic book shop instead. The shop is run by a couple of strange teenage brothers named Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Allen Frog (Jamison Newlander). The two give Sam a horror comic about vampires. Sam says that he doesn't like horror comics, but the two guarantee that he'll like it and that it may save his life. Michael eventually finds the girl, but finds her leaving with some biker friends of hers. Lucy finds a job working at the board walk video rental store, which is run by a seemingly nice guy named Max (Edward Herrmann). The next day, Michael and Sam return to the board walk. Sam goes back to the comic book shop, where the Frog brothers hint around the fact that Santa Carla hides an unusual secret. Michael runs into the beautiful girl, who introduces herself as Star. Star then introduces Michael to her four biker friends, led by David (Kiefer Sutherland). David invites Michael to a gathering at their \\"place.\\" Michael accepts the invitation, not knowing that he is getting into a lot more than he bargained for.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Joel Schumacher's The Lost Boys is a delightful film and easily one of the Top 10 best vampire films of all time. This is an '80s classic and one of my fondest memories of growing up in the 1980s. The project was originally started by \\"Goonies\\" director Richard \\"Dick\\" Donner (who eventually served as executive producer.) Originally the story line was more like \\"The Goonies\\" with vampires (a film intended for kids.) When Schumacher took over the project, he decided to change the characters to teenagers (a good move on his part.) It became a huge hit when it was finally released. The film has a perfect blend of horror as well as comedy. It boasts a vintage cast as well as a fitting soundtrack. The title is a reference to the disciples of Peter Pan, who never grew old and never died (just like vampires.) Greg Cannom did a superb job with the make-up. I would recommend this film to just about anybody. This new 2-disc special edition is presented in a widescreen theatrical format. It also features a ton of extras including the theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, commentary by Joel Schumacher, Lou Gramm's \\"Lost In The Shadows\\" music video, a retrospective documentary, \\"Vamping Out\\" featurette on the undead creatures, \\"The Return of Sam and Frog Brothers: The 2 Coreys and Jamison Newlander\\" - multiangle video commentary, \\"Inside the Vampire's Cave\\" - 4 featurettes, an interactive map, and a photo gallery.started by \\"Goonies\\" director Richard \\"Dick\\" Donner (who eventually served as executive producer.)

B000AXSN5G|5.0|I appreciate Neil Young and his new album even though I don't have it yet. I ordered it from Amazon.com but it hasn't shipped yet but that's ok. I just keep listening to it on Neil Young's web site. I hope we have many more wonderful albums from Neil like this one. When I heard When God Made Me this summer on Live 8 it sent chills down my spine. What an inspired song. Also seeing and hearing Neil play Walking To New Orleans from CMT made me cry. Thanks so much Neil for putting your feelings into music for us.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I liked this change in Sigur Ros' sound, but as with all good albums it grows on you.  If you are a Sigur Ros fan, it is a must.  If you are not, the best way for me to describe them is somewhere between classical, atmospheric and rock.  This area of music is nothing new, but Sigur Ros' music has something others i've heard don't.  You listen and you hear raw emotion and musical talent.  You know the artist understands what he is doing perfectly, and is saying and expressing exactly what he wants to with the music.  And in the end that's what makes a good band. It is always relieving to hear bands that aren't improvising to fill space, or trying to be original, or trying to prove they are artistic, or making the music as complex as possible to prove they can play their instruments in unusual ways. With Sigur Ros everything is where they want it to be and you can tell they love what they're doing.  Not mainstream enough to take over the world, but beautiful anyway. Thanks Jonsi...
0525244581|5.0|great book.  I thought it was hardcover and it was soft but seller let me know before shipped.
B000AL730O|4.0|I particularly like \\"Fine Line.\\" Rock is always about the single, and Paul provides a fun one here. <br />\\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is somber and surprising at the same time. <br />\\"Friends To Go\\" has a feel-good sound, yet the lyrics are ironic.  <br />The playing order works, the sound is clear and McCartney is confident.  <br />Each song is just the right length. <br />At the end of the final track, which is called \\"Anyway,\\" you'll hear a pause and then an uncredited instrumental. In the final portion of this instrumental is a sythesizer which reminds me of the one heard on the Beatles' recordings of \\"The Fool On The Hill,\\" \\"Flying\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\" My educated guess is this is the exact same instrument heard on those cuts. My semi-educated guess is it's called a Vocodor. My less-than-educated guess is it's a Moog. It sounds great. <br /> <br />
B0007P3582|4.0|I was never a big fan of 50 Cent. I still am not a fan of him as a person but his music is catchy. I got his first CD and did not like it at all. I don't listen to the radio at all so I don't ever hear the current hits 50 times a day/400 times a week. I just buy CD's and listen to the songs that I choose to listen to.<br /><br />I know this CD came out quite a long time ago and I just bought it a few weeks ago and I REALLY like it!!! And I know EXACTLY why I like it too: Because it is so mainstream sounding. I know people are dissing the fact that it is so mainstream and people (like me) are liking it for JUST that reason. Catchy, infectious hooks and great beats fill this CD then you mix that with some good samples and good female hook singers and you have a really great CD. I really like it. Songs that I may be jamming out to now might have been a hit, on the radio, months ago but they are new to me. I like it a lot. Very glad I bought it.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I copped the bootleg to this and will definately buy the DVD. It's good. The story was confusing as hell because I didn't really play the game, but it's on my wish list now. <br /> <br />The action in this movie was amazing. I dug the realistic visuals, but they still weren't afraid to make the action unrealistic. It does defeat the point to try to make fiction so close to reality. That's what messed un Spirits Within. Even though I liked that movie too the second time around with no expectations.
2913903878|5.0|No one book will provide all the information that every person would ever want, but when it comes to uniforms, insignia and personal equipment of the U.S. Army in WWII this book is a great start. <br /> <br />It is a book of 272 pages of high quality colour photographs showing thousands of items in the majority of cases as they were issued (brand new). <br /> <br />This book only covers ETO (European theatre of Operations) but considering the size of this book this is not a bad thing. <br /> <br />The only thing that I can think of to make this book better is more period photo's to show how these items looked and were worn in the field. <br /> <br />For students of World War 2 history or Scale model makers (I am both) this is a must have in your reference library. <br />
0783226063|4.0|I saw this movie when it first came out 20 years ago and thought it was okay but not great. Then only last night I watched it again for the first time, and surprisingly I found I liked it much better. Much of that was due to the fact that the intervening years have given the film a nostalgically retro feel that I found worked better now, what with the popularity of \\"steam punk.\\" A lot of the scenes had that sort of look and ambience, the advanced technology often having a sort of Victorian retro appearance in terms of the design, such as the Guild Navigator's environmental chamber.<br /><br />Some of the scenes and special effects were still impressive 20 years later. The sandworms with their gigantic open maws and crystalline teeth are truly awesome and were visualized quite well. But the main characters, though portrayed adequately, lacked development and just didn't have the same charisma and depth as they did in the book.<br /><br />The Guild navigators, who are appropriately bizarre and creepy as befits their use of the mutating melange spice and their unusual abilities in the Dune universe, were a nice concept. But the only character who's really developed much is Paul and to some extent the Bene Gesserit mother superior and Gurney Halleck. But I also have to give some credit to Brad Douriff here in an early performance as Pieter de Vries. He does a good job with the role despite not having much on-screen time.<br /><br />Much of this is no doubt due to having to compress a 600+ page very complex novel into three hours, which also limits what you can do in the way of character development, but still, I was expecting a bit more there since Dune is primarily a novel about powerful characters with unique talents and abilities, rather than advanced technology in the sense of most science-fiction novels. The technology does exist in the story of course, but it's not the real focus of the novel.<br /><br />Lynch also used actual dialog from the book, which, although commendably faithful to the book, limits what the characters can actually say. Sometimes the dialog seems artificial and forced, which isn't a criticism of Herbert so much as the fact that sometimes the characters didn't seem comfortable with the lines and are able to really make them convincing.<br /><br />I had a brief comment about the development of Herbert's ideas for Dune. In reading the novel, I recalled an interesting earlier short story that shows his interest in human psychology and political intrigue. Written in the 50's, a full ten years before Dune, it shows his fascination with these themes can be traced at least back till then. Entitled \\"Cease Fire!,\\" it is about a time in the future when weapons based on conventional explosives have become obsolete because of a new invention--the explosives can now be detonated remotely by means of a revolutionary new psi ability.<br /><br />This basically throws warfare back into the Middle Ages. At the very end of the book, someone hands the main character an old book, saying that this is what warfare will be based on from now on. He looks at the book, and it is Machiavelli's \\"The Prince.\\"<br /><br />I found this interesting given the important place of psychological warfare, political intrigue, and human psychology occupy as themes in Dune. \\"Cease Fire\\" presages these aspects of Dune, and obviously Herbert had been pondering the implications of such a world for some time before writing the book, in addition to Dune's important and pervasive ecological themes--another idea that echoed the Zeitgeist of the times and the more ecologically conscious and aware 1960s.<br /><br />There's one other aspect of the book and film that I have to comment about, and that's the two knife fights that occur. The first is with Gurney Halleck, reputed to be the greatest hand-to-hand fighter in the universe, and the second one between Sting and Paul at the very end. The blade is the preferred personal weapon, and is used to settle feuds and \\"kanly\\" disputes, which are apparently feuds with specific rules and protocols that must be obeyed between houses such as those of the Atreides and the Harkonnens in the book.<br /><br />I found this interesting because I am a karate and kung fu instructor who is also certified in the art of Kali-Escrima, a Filipino and Indonesian art that specializes in the knife and short stick. Kali also incorporates Indonesian Pentjak Silat, which is also a bladed art. There are literally hundreds of styles of Escrima, Kali, and Silat, but most people are not familiar with these arts. I've studied three, which are Kali Illustrisimo, Serrada Escrima, and the Ted LucayLucay system of Kali-Escrima under my guru, Chuck Gonzaga. Chuck is an outstanding martial artist with a broad and deep knowledge of several arts in addition to Kali-Escrima, including Jeet Kune Do, San Sou kung fu, Sebekkha (an eclectic combination of several martial arts taught to the Egyptian anti-terrorist forces), and he is also skilled at the healing massage arts. I am proud to be a certified instructor under Chuck and to be carrying on the lineage of his tradition.<br /><br />I thought the knife fights in the movie were very artful and dramatic, but they weren't really realistic in many ways, and didn't show correct skills or strategy for a knife fight. I'll just point out a few of these.<br /><br />First, you don't stand straight up in a knife fight, you crouch and hunch down with a rounded shoulder posture in order to reduce the total area exposed. Also hunching hollows out the body giving you more distance to your internal organs from the opponent's knife.<br /><br />Second, no knife fighter would move his knife hand as far off the center line, or the non-knife hand as well, since the center line must always be guarded. Third, both fighters are closing and going for deadly body shots right off the bat, but the best strategy is to try to cut the opponent's arm or hand first, to disable or slow him down, since trying to go for a killing blow exposes you to such a counter yourself. This is known as the principle of \\"defanging the snake\\" in Kali-Escrima. Probably 90 percent of knife fighters don't know this important principle.<br /><br />However, I thought the knife fight with the personal shields between Paul and Gurney were a nice touch. As described in the book, the shields stop fast moving objects but allow slower objects to penetrate the force field, so special training and technique is required to get just the right speed. In the last fight, the shields aren't used, and the fight is more typical of what you would see if two people were fighting unprotected, except that as I said, there were some problems with that. I would be interested in knowing who was the adviser for the knife fights or if they had one, and how they came to be created.<br /><br />But all in all, twenty years after I originally saw the movie, a pretty decent flick after all and one that seems to have improved with age in my humble opinion.fic rules and protocols that must be obeyed between houses such as those of the Atreides and the Harkonnens in the book.

B00009W0U4|5.0|This is a haunting piece of work. It's filmed in abstract and steady camera angles which adds depth to the film. I liked it very much and the layers of the story that unravels is riveting.
0743517849|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but I could relate to it personally.  I grew up very poor and have applied all of the principals in this book so I can tell you first hand that they work. <br /> <br />A few to rate this book complain that it is simplistic.  I am very confident that they are also the same people that have made all the mistakes listed in the book.  Most of these people I just laughed at, although some of the critiques have some merit. <br /> <br />The younger your kids get the basic principals of this book, the better.  It will be required reading for all of my kids.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This was a-ha's \\"comeback album\\", after a seven year break.  The three went off to do their own things, then, deciding they still had some juice and still had music to make as a group, got back together and produced this absolutely beautiful album.   <br /> <br />This shows their maturity as individual preformers, songwriters, and, as people.  Those who think that a-ha is nothing more than a one hit wonder with \\"Take On Me\\" haven't done their homework.  This is the perfect album to start doing your homework with.  Every track from \\"Minor Earth Major Sky\\" to \\"Mary Ellen Makes The Moment Count\\" is a wonderful musical experience.  Artists, especially in the music medium, make albums about their own thoughts and feelings, and here we hear all of their woes and joy.  \\"The Company Man\\" shows their distain for their record company, and songs such as \\"LIttle Black Heart\\" show their frustrations with themselves as well as each other.  Their trials with each other were the reason they split, but their love for what they do brought them back together.  What talent and great songwriting is all about, and brought another segment of fans to them, including me.
B00005IB57|5.0|<br />I often come back to him for his Chopin. For an alternative of the Nocturnes, Samson Francois's (a French pianist with a strong personality) is a good choice. Moravec's are very impressing too. For a more recent version, viewers might perhaps check out Dang Thai Son (first Asian Chopin International Competition gold medalist), Ashkenazy's regular partner.  <br /> <br />I also like Cortot, but you have to withstand the archive sound and some wrong notes. Rachmaninov's Chopin is great too. But the recordings are even more primitive and it is incomplete, so is the case of Sauer. Furthermore, like Friedman, Rachmaninov would alter the score a bit here and there...  <br /> <br />So the Chopin that I refer to most are Arrau's other than Cortot. You can go over to him again and again without getting tired: beautiful tone, perfect phrasings beautifully recorded that goes right into the heart of music, and some say he is \\"deep and searching\\"...
B00005JL1C|4.0|Perhaps it was under pressure that John Hughes made this movie, as the reaction to the end of Pretty In Pink caused such uproar.  This was, as so many have pointed out, the ending Pretty In Pink should have had; and, as it turned out, this would be John Hughes's last aclaimed teen dramedy (by both critics and audience) of the 80s.   <br /> <br />We are rooting for the overturn of social class and pecking orders once again in High School USA.  Keith, the artistic outcast soft boy, has been mooning over the prettiest, most popular girl in school, Amanda Jones.  Amanda Jones is the arm candy of the typical ego inflated Big Man on Campus, Hardy, and otherwise preoccupied.  The whole time, right under his nose, his friend Watts has been in love with him.  A star crossed lovers' triangle if there ever was one - or perhaps a square, or even another polygon as Hardy cheats. <br /> <br />Keith decides to risk life and limb by crossing the social barriers and asks Amanda out.  Much to everyone's surprise, Amanda accepts (based out of revenge against Hardy's wandering eye), and the drama unfolds.  Watts is jealous enough that she offers to drive them.  Hardy is outraged enough that he attempts to reclaim his Big Man On Campus role by having his loyal minions beat him up and asert himself as the Alpha Male.  Everyone's friends and support systems are cheering or shunning them, and it all culminates on the night of the Big Date and The Party at Hardy's house. <br /> <br />While this movie is full of cheesy quotes here and there, and knowing what I know now I wonder if in fact Watts was a little \\"confused\\" about her sexuality (she was pushing that butch thing a bit far), it has some heart to it.  Amanda Jones, while uses her feminine charms to get out of detention, isn't the shallow socialite she appears to be and shows that she has strength and character.  Watts, while pretending to be tough as nails and impervious, lets her jealousy show but puts it aside enough to let bygonesbe bygones.  And Keith, miracle of miracles, sees that Watts is the genuine article and he would prefer her over Amanda Jones. <br /> <br />It's a wonderful thought - hence the title - but, knowing what I know now, I am cynical and somewhat embittered.  I wish I had a nickel for everyone who has chosen the wrong person over the right one, for everyone who has been disappointed, hurt or suffered a heartbreak, and for everyone who acted immaturely, selfish, and abusive.  Some of those people look back, realize their mistake and change for the better, but even more blame the other person and go on doing what they've been doing.  This movie had heart, and it showed us the right thing to do, which is why I gave it 4 stars. <br /> <br />Why not 5?  I wish they had developed that side character of Duncan the Skinhead a little more.  He was threatening and sullen when they first introduced him, but once in detention with Keith became a loyal ally.  And once he rescues Keith from certain death at the popular kids' party I would've liked to see him and his posse trash the house.  <br />
0767834739|5.0|Great response in getting the movie to me.  I haven't watched the dvd yet but I'm sure its great.  Thank you
B000002IJL|5.0|I loved that movie Stand By Me when I was a kid, as I was the same age as the boys in this movie and felt like I too was going on sort of a \\"spiritual journey\\" with them in the course of the movie.  Years later seeing it, well, it's not the same.  I've lost my innocence since then and it doesn't have the same magic it used to.  The soundtrack, however, will always live in my heart. <br /> <br />I had never heard of any of the artists, let alone the songs, which this wonderful soundtrack included.  I began to explore a world out there that I didn't know existed, the world of the past and who all these great rock n' rollers were.  This soundtrack, as well as The Lost Boys soundtrack, helped mold and shape me into who I am today.  For this I will always be greatful.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I loved and think is a close call between FFVII AND FFX as it the best of the best RPGs around.  If I am not mistaken the same artist that did the graphics for FFX cutscenes is the same one for this movie.  The story is fairly simple, not much is said about the other characters, but having them in the movie is a big plus.  The fight scenes are so awesome and there are a few big surprises (may I say the Aeris death will still be the most talk about video game event in history).  I just wished this was more like a mini series,I still crave for more movies like this type perharps a FFX movie?  I love Square for making it right with this one.  I wish Cloud would show a little more affection towards Tifa.  Other than that get this is you crave for the Best ever computer generated graphics up to date, and mainly if you played the  game and finished otherwise you would be lost.
B00005JKOI|5.0|If this was not the worst of the worst let down for audiences across America, I don't know what was.  Pretty In Pink, while it might have been Molly Ringwald's crowning achievement tied with Sixteen Candles, lives on in teen movie folklore and John Hughes's impressive resume, was anticlimatic.  The heroine doesn't end up with the lovable friend who had loved her from afar for years, but ends up with the rich guy.  Lucky for her the rich guy cares for her.  Rumor had it that the test audiences wanted her to end up with the rich guy and not the lovable Duckie.  *Sigh*  Well, the screwballs spoke and the producers listened.  We have Pretty In Pink still, but the ending brought it all down the drain.  So much for giving the people what they want. <br /> <br />That was how I felt years ago.  Oh to be so young and foolish again!  I hadn't known love yet, and I hadn't known the pain of unrequited love as I do now.  Please let me point out to the world reading this that I am not a martyr who suffered so others can be happy, and I'm not a victim either although I've had my share of abusive and bad relationships.  If anything I've been very lucky, I've learned more about love than most people twice my age, if I can be so bold.  I identified the most with Duckie here, because just because you love someone doesn't mean that you are going to live happily ever after.  The love of my life and I are far apart, he choose to go another way, and I went another way as well.  But I will always love him.  I am sad without him, but, like DUckie, we all move on.
B00008OLYN|5.0|if you sort the reviews by 1 star rating you'll notice a trend of korn, system of a down and other \\"nu metal\\" fans, this obviously isnt for that genre.  you'll also notice that these reviewers complain about the overly creative and progressive nature of this album (and this band), is that a bad thing, never.  my point being is that bad reviews for this album are a result of dumb asses listening the radio friendly crap
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Takk isn't the first Sigur Ros album sung in Icelandic. That would be Agaetis Byrjun (which incorporated only small amounts of \\"Hopelandic\\"). <br /> <br />Anyways. <br /> <br />I was terrified to listen to this album. Agaetis Byrjun is one of the most beautiful albums ever constructed, and ( ) was also an amazing feat (though I rarely listen to it, as it sounds so bleak and almost suicidal). Takk, though, is a stellar return to what made me fall in love with this band in the first place. Amazing instrumentation that's completely uplifting. What really makes this album, though, is the percussion work by Orri Pall Dyrason. Instead of accenting the rest of the instruments, it becomes a focal point, especially in the climax of Glosoli. <br /> <br />Beautiful. One of the best albums of the year.
6305736650|5.0|Full Automatic Fire Writing. A pleasure for anyone who can read.<br /><br />Certainly one of the 10 best movies ever crafted. This film never rates<br /><br />lower than 2nd or 3rd place among the AFI's (American Film Institute: directors<br /><br />and actors and such) top 100 films of all time. It's CLASSIC. It's great.<br /><br />And you've never heard of it? It's only the most romantic movie ever made.
0240804236|4.0|It's comprehensive, it's well written and it is easy to follow the chemical recipes.  <br />It is exactly what it claims to be nothing more and nothing less.
B0006OBPTA|3.0|You've already seen the movie, why should I bother reviewing it?  So how bout the special features then. <br /> <br />Commentary......Kinda disappointed in this. Everybody's joking around so much and talking over each other that it wasn't that great. But Ralph came off REALLY great, he actually seemed to know more about the technical aspect than Avildsen! He still really cares about the film, has collectibles from the set, and remembers a lot about locations and rehearsals.  <br /> <br />Pat has that slurred laugh, and conflicting information to everyone else. And if I have to hear him say how \\"cute\\" Ralphie is one more time, puke.  <br /> <br />Kamen and Avildsen were smart as.ses, who once in awhile would shut up and say how great a scene was. These four guys really loved this film. <br /> <br />The interviews were really well done. Ralph, Pat, Avildsen, Kamen, Kove, Zabka, Pat Johnson and Conti. Plus some GREAT behind the scenes footage interspersed with the interviews. Home video and 16mm shots of the beach fight rehearsal and Kreese's screentest. Some good stills of Pat and Ralph laughing during the dojo scene. <br /> <br />The widescreen transfer is great. Vivid and crisp, like it was filmed today. Though often times they got commentary wrong. Like the apartment building is NOT torn down. It still stands today in Reseda. <br /> <br />Disappointed in the cheap cases, slimline junk. But if you have a three dvd regular case lying around.... <br /> <br />And NO sequel stuff! Sure, I didn't expect a commentary, but they don't even talk about it in the interviews! The interviews say Part 1 and Part 2...this is because they broke the KK 1 interviews into two parts??? Who knows why.  <br /> <br />Hopefully someday we'll get commentaries, but not likely of course. Dying to know how they'd all four talk about KK3.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is an emotional and humerous story about the son of a zoo keeper, Pi Patel.  Growing up on a zoo in Pondicherry, India, Pi was fascinated with religion.  He practiced Hinduism, his family religion, and also picks up on the religions of Christianity and Islam.  The story hits a turning point when they have to leave India.  Pi's father gets a job in Canada, and the family packs into a freighter and heads across the Ocean.  The ship crashes unexpectedly on the way and the only one to get out alive was Pi.  He escaped on a lifeboat, stuck with an orangatan, a hyper hyena, a zebra, and a giant of a tiger.  The crew face many dangerous and scary moments while in shark infested waters, but Pi and the tiger manage to stay alive.  Now they must deal with each other, which Pi thinks could be worse than living at all.  Read for yourself the wild adventures of Pi and how he ends up after living with a tiger for almost a year.
0783240287|5.0|I had a wonderful time watching this with my 5 year old daughter and my 9 year old neice. The songs are truly delightful and the children (well, and me!) both loved the story-telling approach. I think that it helped that I first told them the story in brief because then they loved seeing the story being depicted through song and dance. Ms Friedman does a wonderful job as the narrator, and the different styles adopted for the songs (everything from rock 'n' roll to disco to calypso) works very well. <br /> <br />My only issue with the DVD was that the sound seems a little muted at the beginning for a couple of minutes, but fortunately the rest of the DVD was just fine. <br /> <br />The documentary on the making of the movie included as an extra is extremely interesting too. Especially the snippets of children from various schools performing songs from the show. <br /> <br />If you have children, you should buy this movie. Not just for them to watch, but for you to watch with them. My daughter, neice and I have seen it three times so far in two weeks, and the next sitting is scheduled for this weekend.
B000002C4O|3.0|Celine Dion embraces a wide array of styles on this release--a little rock here, a little urban soul there, lots of lavish pop (including a duet with la Streisand) and a nod to the classical world with a duet with Luciano Pavarotti.      Fans love this record. Others will likely find the attempts at diversity a bit strained--as are some of the vocals.  But for the most part, Dion is in rare form on this release.  She proves herself to be something of a stylistic chameleon.  Does a Quebecoise in L.A. (or Vegas) have any other choice?  She approaches various American pop genres with equal ease and equal eagerness.  Only the occasional awkward intonation or pronunciation suggests that these songs are being sung by a non-native speaker of English.      She's worked hard to master these non-native styles, it would seem.  The occasional featheriness in her voice seems like an affection she could stand to lose.  And some of the high notes are a bit on the pinched side.  But in pop, some characteristic vocal flaws are what serve to establish a style, so I guess these reservations are just so much quibbling.    Often compared to any number of pop and soul divas, Dion at least occasionally evokes seemingly off-the-wall comparisons as well.  The opening track, Carole King's \\"The Reason\\" actually reminded me of Grace Slick at her poppiest (cf. \\"I Don't No Why\\" from the late 80s Starship NO PROTECTION album).  If Dion seems a few galaxies removed from the Starship's spacy siren, well, keep in mind that we're not talking the \\"White Rabbit\\" era here.  And with King serving as a pop/rock intermediary, anything is possible. No more unlikely than the urban soul of \\"Treat Her Like A Lady\\" in any event.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|This production is stunning! The orchestration is crisp and brilliant, the singers were amazing (their voices had so much color, the singing was expressive), and the scenery was lovely (not too gaudy). I really liked how it was set up in the 18th-century, with the priests posing as the men of the Enlightenment. I kept on thinking, \\"so where's Voltaire?\\"  <br /> <br />The voices: <br />* Tamino had a darkness to it that brought the character to life. He didn't seem like a dumb, little rich boy, and it gave him maturity and dimention. <br />* Pamina had a soft, innocent ring, but also grown up. The voice was expressive and full of emotion. Her \\"Ach, ich Fuehl's\\" was GORGEOUS! <br /> <br />Keenlyside (Papageno) and Damrau (Queen of the Night) clearly stood out above all.  <br /> <br />Keenlyside's Papageno was soooooooo believable. I found myself laughing at his gestures (musical and physical) as well as his facial expressions. What an energetic man! I can't imagine a better Papageno.  <br /> <br />Damrau's Queen was AWESOME! Her voice is powerful and elastic. The woman did not bark the high notes, as most sopranos do, she SUNG them! -- and what a voice!!! <br /> <br />The sore moments: <br />The 3 boys... they were flat most of the time and their harmonies were not happening... at all. They are the reason I gave this otherwise amazing production 4 1/2 stars.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I gave it five stars because I would normally give it three or four, but some people were overally rude in their evaluation of the movie and their ratings uncalled for in this case. This is the kind of movie I grew up on at Matinees. It is about time they brought it back. Fans of the Indiana Jones movies or \\"National Treasure\\" will probably like it. The outstanding cast is the best thing. Penelope Cruz was the exception, because her performance was decent, not great. They could not have picked a better group to play the parts. They are all scene stealers that can ham it up with the best of them. Well written action drama with some comedy thrown in at the right moments.<br /><br />The premise is NUMA treasure hunters have been relatively successful and former SEAL Dirk Pitt, the hansom Matthew McConaughey, has his own back story of looking for a Confederate ironclad ship lost during the Civil War. He carries a gold coin that supposedly ties in with its disappearance. The action is almost non-stop when they meet an attractive lady doctor, Penelope Cruz, from the world health organization trying to track down a deadly illness. This is a fairly well made action movie that the whole family can enjoy. The ending hints that the government would pay for future help in similar events, and thus we have an opening for a sequel. I hope they do one, and improve on it. It is a pleasure to watch and I bought a copy for it's replayability. The quality of the DVD is excellent and it has several extras.
B000001GXI|3.0|The mismatched voices were extremely distracting. Peters as the Queen didn't work well... at all.  I bought this cd and I *hardly* ever want to listen to it.
B000AL730O|3.0|For all the hype about this Cd it sure left be wondering where the hit was on the CD. I kept waiting and when the last song was over......I thought, wow was this the former Beatle, or was this someone trying to go in a new direction and got lost. <br /> <br />All solo performances, and very dull, I did listen to it a second time to see if I had missed something, I didn't and was VERY dissapointed with a new release that was hyped up to be the next Sgt Pepper. <br /> <br />I guess once a Beatle you always expect Beatles or even Wings style music. Sir Paul......wake up and give your fans what they want...what George Harrison gave us, The Traveling Wilburys got it right with the 1st album they made. George is now looking like the only Beatle that was not only quite, but came on stong in the end. <br /> <br />
0345423496|4.0|I hadn't read any SF books (except for Jules Verne and HG Wells) when I started this one. For me this book was worth the time and money if only for the fact that it is based in 3001...Judging by the developments in technology in the past 100 years and assuming that technology will continue to grow at an exponential rate...imagining life in 3001 is quite a task. The author's vision may or may not be similar to the world in 3001,,,but some of the ideas are certainly interesting and provide some food for thought.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a nearly perfect CD! Many wonderful Christina Aguilera songs are on it, and boy oh boy are they ever enjoyable and full of feeling! They also have great tunes! Here is how I rate all of these songs, sung by Chrissy, who I think is really awesome! <br /> <br />1. Stripped Part 1-Great! It's all about Christina when she is-! Well, you know.  <br /> <br />2. Can't Hold Us Down-God, I love this song! Chrissy and Lil' Kim talk about how their lives have gone and what they do on free time. Perfect for summertime. <br /> <br />3. Walk Away-This song is pretty good. Christina tells her feelings about love and pain both together at the same time. <br /> <br />4. Fighter-THIS SONG IS PERFECT! IT RULES! IT IS MY FAVORITE CHRISTINA AGUILERA SONG OF ALL TIME! CHRISSY TELLS HOW SHE WAS TORTURED AND MADE POWERFUL! PERFECT TUNE, PERFECT LYRICS, PERFECT PERIOD! BUY THE CD FOR THIS ALONE!!!!!!! <br /> <br />5. Infatuation(interlude)-My liking for this track is questionable. I don't quite get it. <br /> <br />6. Infatuation-What a great song! It is about the love Chrissy has for men and how she wants to treat them well as their lovely wedded wife. She really shows herself! <br /> <br />7. Loving Me For Me(Interlude)-See rating for track 5. <br /> <br />8. Loving Me For Me-Well, I will say this song rocks. And I will also say that it really shows Christina is not going to be ashamed about who she is or what she feels. <br /> <br />9. Impossible-Now this is a song I'm looking for! Chrissy reveals all her moments of being frustrated and/or in a bad or exasperated mood because of various problems. <br /> <br />10. Underappreciated-I like this song. Yes, I like this song very much. It is a telling as only Christina can do of how she has done many great things, but doesn't get her due.  <br /> <br />11. Beautiful-I listened to this many times, on the radio and this CD, mostly in the winter. It was soothing and relaxing. Christina lets people know that no one can make her believe sheis not beautiful. <br /> <br />12. Make Over-Well, as far as I remember, this song is good. Or at least okay. It is mainly about Christina getting ready to sing or to date a man of some sort.  <br /> <br />13. Cruz-I will say this-it is an OK yet well sung song. Hey, that rhymes! Almost! <br /> <br />14. Soar-This song is okay. It is basically about Christina in a high, happy mood. <br /> <br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours-Great song, no doubt. Christina in this one describes her want for revenge and/or love. Maybe both at the same time. <br /> <br />16. Dirrty-This is a cool, funny song. Christina expresses her desire to party with all sorts of people and to, in a crude and confusing way, get herself very dirty. <br /> <br />17. Stripped Part 2-Christina gets even more s**y in this one. All about losing your clothes and have raunchy fun. Absolutely hilarious.  <br /> <br />18. A Voice Within-This is a good song, like many on the album. Chrissy tells how each person on the planet is different, in terms of want, need, luck, & more. Whoa. <br /> <br />19. I'm OK-Kind of sad. Christina tells how her brutal father cruelly abused her and all of her family, and how she survived and now has a good life. As a singer, duh! <br /> <br />20. Singing My Song-A good ending to a great album. This is a song with cool and funny lyrics, a well thought out tune, and sung as only Christina Aguilera can.  <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, this is among the very best albums I own(of course it is among my favorite ones)and to anyone who likes female singers I recommed it with all my might. You a Christina fan? Buy this album. You aren't? Buy this album and become one. Oh, and I think Christina Aguilera is one of the best artists of all time. She absolutely rocks!!!!

B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney has quite a repertoire of wonderful music from the Beatles to his solo (or Wings) work.  The present album contributes many beautiful new songs to the McCartney collection.  The album is definitely ranked with his best solo work including Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, and Flaming Pie.  Both lyrically and musically McCartney is at the top of his game in this album.  The songs remind me mostly of the White Album (1968), Abbey Road (1969), and the McCartney album (1970).  The album lacks a ballad like \\"Let It Be\\" or \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" or \\"Only Love Remains,\\" but it has a lot of great songs along the lines of \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Golden Slumbers,\\" and \\"Junk.\\"  On the new record my favorite songs are \\"Too Much Rain,\\" \\"Anyway,\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl.\\"
B000005IU1|5.0|This first Stooges Lp is arguably their best, but also was the birthplace of drone rock as we've come to know later on through Spacemen 3, Jesus and Mary Chain, Ride & even the Cramps, and Sonic Youth. \\"Little Doll\\" was covered by the Spacemen 3 and is a little 3 chord droner, simple but hypnotic. Listen to the cruchy distortion on \\"1969\\" or \\"Real cool Time\\", or the gritty, sleigh bell stomp of \\"I wanna be Your dog\\" and you can hear that fuzz, leaking out all over the place. \\"Not Right\\" and \\"No fun\\" are more of the same disaffected, drone rock that the Stooges eventually left behind on the rowdy \\"Raw Power\\" LP and the more polished, but still powerful \\"Funhouse\\" LP. This is the place to start.
0446614459|4.0|The only David Baldacci which I had read before reading Split Second was Saving Faith. I disliked Saving Faith. I found it long on flash and short on substance. In fact, I only picked up Split Second because I was travelling in Spain and literally had no other choice of reading matter.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book. Compared to Saving Faith I found it restrained and well plotted. It was more of a traditional mystery than I had expected and I enjoyed the time that the characters spent going back to basics and unraveling the mystery. I also liked the way that Baldacci handled the two female characters in relation to the plot. It was genuinely suspenseful and kept me wanting to read despite the competition from my vacation.<br /><br />The ending was goofy, but by that point I had enjoyed reading it enough that it only annoyed me a little bit.<br /><br />Reading the reviews, it seems clear that this book was not appreciated by the more traditional Baldacci fans. It may be that because I am more of a mystery reader than a thriller reader I liked this compared to his other work. Depending on your tastes, you may have the same reaction. In any case, I thought it was an excellent book for travelling or to read on vacation.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Are Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez comic book geeks?  Yeah.  Bigtime.  Is it any wonder that they were able to talk the hesitant Frank Miller into making his pulp comic dynasty Sin City into a movie?  Porbably not.  They tried awfully hard and Rodriguez first treatment did make a pretty impressive splash with creator Miller.  Hence, a comic book movie is born.<br /><br />Probably the first comic book movie.<br /><br />Sure there's Batman and Superman and X-Men and Spider-Man and blah-de-blah-blah.  But one:  None of these movies were filmed by Tarrantino and Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Two: These movies were adaptions of comics turned into movies.  Sin City is a comic book turned into a comic book movie.  Hard to explain....unless you've seen it.  Miller is a great artist (he worked on the Marvel Limited series of Wolverine in the mid-80's) and he has a certain vision.  Rodriguez did not want this to be Frank Miller's Sin City as portrayed by Robert Rodriguez.  He wanted Frank Miller's Sin City.  Period.<br /><br />I think he got that and a helluva lot more.<br /><br />Do you need to be a Comic Book Geek to love this movie?  No.  It would help.  But it wouldn't be a prerequisite.  In fact, after viewing the movie, on having liked it, you may have a new-found appreciation of comics in general.<br /><br />To cut to the chase.  This is a dark and unseemly movie with dark and unseemly subject matter.  It moves like a hurricane.<br /><br />Dig it.

B00003CXBK|1.0|I watched this movie with some Japanese friends of mine, and I was mesmerized.  However, we had some difficulty deciding which English version was best.  We turned on the American voice-over version (with Minnie Driver (what the heck?) and the like), and my friends started laughing at it from the very beginning.  We then played, I think it was the American subtitles with Japanese voice, and I was told that the words on the screen did not at all match the words being said.  Finally, we settled on the literal English subtitles.    This translation seemed to be the closest to what was actually being said.  When we were done watching the film, we watched the American previews.  I was shocked when, was it Claire Danes or Minnie Driver, described the movie as heartwarming and being about friendship and love.  HA! No wonder parents thought it was a kids movie.  This film is an adult movie, not for kids.  The themes are much more suitable for young adults.  In the literal English version, you see everyone in the story, yes, even animals and trees as being responsible for the state of things in the world.  You see a shocking portrayal of the \\"circle of life\\" as it were.  The story is not supposed to be resolved by the end, it's supposed to show that life goes on, that there are conflicts in this world that will just continue to transform and that there's only so much one can do.  If you enjoy beautiful animation and a thoughtful plot, watch this movie, but not this only American voice version, get the literal English subtitles . . .please!
B000A0GP4K|3.0|in this documentary you will learn a lot about hibbing minnesota in the 1950s. also, the nyc folk scene in the early 1960s. you'll see all the outtakes of \\"don't look back\\" (including a little bit of dylan and the band playing). and dylan being interviewed by an off camera friend. besides the history lesson what do you learn about bob dylan? not much. i figured that with both bob dylan and martin scorsese this documentary had to be great. it's not. instead it's very long and somewhat boring. i did watch the whole thing but then i'm a big bob dylan fan. disappointing and very overrated.

B0000024W3|5.0|Critics love to critique and Dylan fans love music.  And if you appreciate and are in awe of Dylan's entire artistic contributions spanning his long and storied career, this album will not disappoint.  Perhaps it is easier in retrospect to appreciate this album, such as I do, since I was not even born when it was released.   <br />Perhaps if a burning idealism that pivoted on the words and images of an artist was steering my life's course in 1970, perhaps if I had been in a hallucinogenic fog for the previous 3 years prior its release, or perhaps if my government was fighting some far off misguided war and my college was afire in protest and I needed to reel in my prophet and give him a good smack down for not telling me what the hell I should be thinking and feeling and saying, then MAYBE I might have cast aside this musical effort when it first appeared and fallen into rank with the rest of the critics who often refer to this album as a mis-step, a failed effort, a pile of s@*t, a \\"what the f*!@?\\".   <br />The Dylan fire was fortuitously lit for me in the early eighties spinning my dad's \\"Greatest Hits LP's\\".  But I only picked up my own first Dylan album when \\"Oh Mercy\\" was being laid down in a the steamy bayou backwaters of the Big Easy.  And since then I have slowly immersed myself in the treasure chest of Dylan recordings, aquiring the nuggets as they came to me.   <br />First it was Blonde on Blonde, then Freewheelin', Times...\\", and so on and so forth.  The usual order of aquistion for the young post-era collector.  <br />It wasn't until the early nineties when I picked up \\"Self Portrait\\".  At first listen, the album was pleasant, if not a little perplexing though.  This wasn't the Dylan on Freewheelin, but it was Dylan, and Dylan is an artist I felt was an artist for the sake of personnal expression, doing what he loves, exploring ideas and sounds, and not spitting out palatable harmonies and lyrics to play for your grandmother.  I wasn't a music critic, just a fan of music.  And I liked it enough. <br />It wasn't until recently revisting this album on CD (my first copy was the beautiful double vinyl) that I truly came to appreciate it.  I have no idea what Dylan was thinking at the time of recording this.  Clearly it deviates from his previous recordings, yet borrows from Nashville Skyline and what I feel must have been an interest in exploring other genres because he wanted to, especially after recently spending time in Nashville and undoubtedly listening to the live music scene down there. <br />The album to me is sort of a family picture book, a bunch of sounds and images captured in a collage, mixed, interwoven, for better or worse.  Hey, its your family. <br />I love this album, I love its variety, I love its musical wanderings and its sweet and simple and uncomplicated (almost) contents.  Its grown on me like my favorite cheap beer.  A standard for non-events, lazy evenings, chores around the house.  If you love Dylan and love his musical genius and really could care less what all the 'music critics' think and feel and think you must think and feel, then get this album.  It will not disappoint.
0812550757|5.0|This book started slow for me, but turned the corner to outstanding. It's much more contemplative than the first, with a good deal of religious implication for and about Ender. Ender's character development far supasses the first, in scope and depth. <br /> <br />This is one the few novels that actually brought a tear to my eye more than once. <br /> <br />Very moving, very \\"human\\".  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this one.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|this album is the most refreshing burst of music that i have heard in a long time. it has angst, humor, love and a hint of mystery with the two russian tracks. and the fact that the tracks were in russian lets the audio consumer hear what the girls of tATu wanted us to hear, and how much it lost when it was translated to english.  <br /> <br />buy this if you want an album that doesn't require you as the listener to skip most of the tracks, all of the tracks are a joy to listen to.
B000002AEN|5.0|No, don't do the same thing. When you steal from your local library you are bound to get caught. It's been a long lonely run on the road since then.<br /><br />This is really good stuff that was recorded in 1928! The sound quality alone is gonna blow your mind when you think of that.<br /><br />Mississippi John Hurt is a blues singer, but not a raw edged blues singer, he's got a very soft and easy feel to his music. It's gentle acoustic guitar, and warm vocals that deliver some beautiful, sometimes haunting songs.<br /><br />I would never have stole this from my library if I realized that I could find it for sale. (I guess by now I should realize that you can get just about anything on this peice.) This is a very great CD of early blues/folk that you will enjoy. I find it best to listen to when I happen to wake up very early in the morning before anyone else is awake. Thats a good time to chill with the late great Mississippi John Hurt.
B000002GYG|5.0|Tom Waits' best! Jazzy edge with witty beat poetry feel. Beautiful and raunchy and real. This CD captured a great live performance in this planet's music history. Ranks among the best in my collection.
B0000024RZ|5.0|Just look at the cover, man. Have you ever seen him so bitter and fed up with it all? It's so black and white. This is a dark album for BOB DYLAN. The follow up to the much lighter FREEWHEELIN' album. Its a heavy change of pace from one album to the next, especially considering it came so early in his career.<br /><br />I'm not really crazy about folk music, but this thing surpasses folk. FREEWHEELIN' was a folk album (and yeah, it was amazing) but this here is doomy. My favorites are HOLLIS BROWN and HATTIE CARROL because they are probably the most cryptic.<br /><br />Thats not really what they are supposed to be either. These songs are about things that were going on. \\"Protest\\" songs. I hate most of the die hard fans from the early sixties, pompous jerks, all of them. I HATE PETE SEEGER! That guy was a GOON! How was Bob Dylan mixed up with these jerks?<br /><br />However, Dylan wasn't influenced by anyone but himself essentially and it doesn't matter WHO listens. This stuff is another worthy DYLAN. The reason he was such an icon in the folk scene was because he was the only one who didn't SUCK. Sorry Joan Baez.
B000B5XZLU|4.0|although this album came out just last week here in America, it had already been released overseas in Europe and just about everywhere else back in the middle of june.  being a serious music lover and a big jamiroquai fan myself, i just could not wait until september to hear the funky grooves of 'dynamite', and i went and purchased an import copy for only 10 dollars, and through Amazon!  well, after a 4 year wait, we finally get jay kay and his crew back for another round of delicious dance floor grooves and hot , boomin' tracks for your car or stereo.  things kick off with the non-familiar sound of \\"feels just like it should', which actually leads the album off in a great way, just to get you ready for the hot, sultry beats of the title track.  things are still going strong with great songs like '7 days in sunny june', 'electric mistress', 'starchild', 'loveblind',  all of which can conjure up some great times on anybody's dance floor or anybody's basement party.  each of the other tunes on this album are just as good as the ones that i have already praised, so i'll just let you just those tunes for yourself.  actually, one thing has been annoying regarding all of recent reviews of 'dynamite':  why are some you fans out there so damn negative?  it's only been 4 years since jason kay put out an album, and since many of today's releases are complete homogenized fm radio crap,  anything put out by jamiroquai can easily be considered one of the best pop/rock/funk albums of the year.  the new albums don't have to sound like 'emergency on planet earth', or even 'return of the space cowboy'.  hell, my personal favorite is 1999's classic \\"synkronized\\", but i do not expect 'dynamite' to be just like that classic, do i?  every artists album should stand on their own, just like 'dynamite' should.  give it a chance, don't be so quick to judge so damn fast.  and with the recent troubles in America, especially a couple of very evil women named Katrina and Rita( no dis to the real women out there), this album could turn out to be the perfect solution to ease everybody's minds down on the gulf coast.  oh well, i am only one person. i still believe in you jay.  keep the party funkin' on for the south, brother.l women out there), this album could turn out to be the perfect solution to ease everybody's minds down on the gulf coast.  oh well, i am only one person. i still believe in you jay.  keep the party funkin' on for the south, brother.
B0000024R8|5.0|I have this on a very old and tattered peice of vinyl that was handed down from my dad. Last night I watched the premeir of NO DIRECTION HOME the Martin Scorsese doc on DYLAN on PBS. Part two is on tonight and I can hardly wait. Anyway there was a lot about how DYLAN got into the studio and made this album whe he was twenty years old. AMAZING.<br /><br />I've never really paid much attention to this album because its mainly covers and I'm not huge on the folk stuff.<br /><br />After learning about how DYLAN went about this allbum it suddenly seems like another DYLAN triumph. As incredible as many of his other peices of work. This is the stuff he was playing in coffee shops, HOUSE OF THE RISIN'SUN and BABY PLEASE DONT GO, all actually very unique versions of these songs and not as \\"standard\\" as a typical standard should go.<br /><br />Also, these songs were recorded on the fly, which means COLUMBIA just through this guy in the studio for a couple of hours and told him to do his thing.<br /><br />Not really sure if he was being taken for a ride DYLAN decided to do only two original songs, SONG FOR WOODY, dedicated to his biggest influence at the time WOODY GUTHRIE and also a handful of other folk legends and how their words inspired him to find his own words and also TALKIN NEW YORK, which was about the things he'd learned while living (staying alive) in the big city.<br /><br />The covers are whatever he could think of while he sat there in the studio.<br /><br />I immediatley had to dig this thing out and listen to it. Its simpleness is what makes it great, and I really like the way it sounds on a peice of scratchy record.<br /><br />I'm gonna have to buy the CD though now because I'm hooked and the record skips like a bastard. Other great tunes are BABY LET ME FOLLOW YOU DOWN and SHES NO GOOD.<br /><br />DYLAN at his PUREST!
B000005JAX|3.0|The album is okay. <br />I am surprised that nobody mentioned \\"A smile in the crowd\\". Martin Gore's version of this song from The Durutti Column is absolutely amazing!
0920668372|5.0|I was read aloud this book when a was in grade school by my 1st grade teacher. I remember as she read this book to her students she would begin to cry. Back then I didn't fully understand why this book would bring her to tears but I've always loved this book and known it to be heart warming. Now I'm 22 years old and have a newborn. The verses in this book brings me to tears whenever I read it as it did my 1st grade teacher. Buy this book if you are a mother or buy it as a gift for one. It will touch you heart.

0307276902|3.0|Yeah, here's the Macho fantasy, par excellance. All ya need is Ego, eh, Jimmy Frey-boy? How's about all that for showin, 'em? Look at me, Ma, I'm Machismo Jim; just like 'Papa' Hemingway...Why, I'll wear that Macho Man, pit-bull, in your face, I'm A Man, (no sissies like these \\"recovery\\"  wimps) struttin stuff and take you readers hostage. I don't care. I got you in my grip! And you will be beholden. You will. And bet your hide--I may end up like 'Papa' himself, blown out and dead, a tribute to the very futility of Ego, and the reality of a limp and impotent Body and Spirit. (Anyone out there know about 'Papa's' real issues? The man was totally impotent. And he ended his life. Macho to the very end?) Oh, well. I sold books, though, and for a while, they believed me.      It's not that this guy can't write; he can; it's his arrogance I can't seem to get past because it's so \\"in-your-face\\" . (Can you imagine if a woman writer dare to show such brazen-ness? They'd  steal her words and get some guy's name on there.)              Someone else here mentioned the excellent memoir \\"Another Bull___ Night in Suck City\\" which is so intelligent and so brutally real , with no compromises, and another, fiction work, though, \\"Simon Lazerus\\" which is, by far, more realistic in how  both these books explore the complexities of  being male, (really, much less addiction), and neither of these has the time or inclination to narcissistically indulge the way this James Frey does. Sorry, he's  bull.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw this series when it was on TV and after watching the DVDs I'm sorry to have missed it. Firefly really is one of the most realistic views of the future I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the mix of high and low tech. Yes, they have laser weapons but they're illegal to own so people still use slug throwing weapons. I thought the mix of cultures was very true to what our future might hold. <br /> <br />Mostly Firefly is just fun. It's well written characters placed in interesting situations that just happen to be a mix of Sci-fi and the old west with a bit of Asian flair.
B000001FW9|5.0|Gentle Giant were one of the truly great bands from the Seventies , their music was totally indefinable . Well I suppose that is not initially true , it was sort of a mixture of Rock/Jazz/Blues/ Progressive Rock/ Folk/ Medieval/Dance/ Pop/ Heavy Metal/Fusion/Classical/Big Band/New Age/World/ and of course original Gentle Giant sound . So as you can imagine it was just a little bit difficult to find the exact pigeon hole to file them under ,listening to them, you can only conclude that they should have had their own little section so everybody could find them.<br /><br />The band started when the three brothers Shulman , Derek,Ray, and Phil, got fed up with life as part of Simon Dupree and The Big Sound , who were semi-famous for having a couple of hits in the late Sixties, most notably 'Kites' from 1967 . Wishing to go onto something with higher (sic) ideals than their pop band, like wise musicians were sort out . This search started in 1969 , when of course there was an absolute abundance of very talented muso's around all having been brought up on a heavy diet of Robert Johnson, Chuck Berry,Elvis, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones , Hendrix ,Vanilla Fudge,etc and were now ready to spread their own wings . A butterfly plucks a chord in Memphis can lead to a whole musical movement in London.<br /><br />Three like-minded musicians were selected. Keyboard wizard Kerry Minear was obviously going to be a very useful limb to the Giant , as he could also sing lead vocals on the more rock orientated songs , plus play the odd bass note when Ray Shulman had other duties , Martin Smith got the seat behind the bins as he was found to be a drummer that was prepared to adapt to whatever musical style the rest decided to change to , even if it was three or four times during one song . Perhaps the pick of the bunch though was guitarist Gary Green , a guitarist who could either play his axe with great feeling picking his notes with passion and subtlety, or could knock you dead by turning round and playing so fast the wallpaper would strip from your walls.<br /><br />So thus was the mighty Gentle Giant born in 1969,  a very apt title as there was no doubt the strength of this musical group, nor was there any doubt in their charm and wit.<br /><br />The first album was released in 1970, when really the Giant was just finding it's feet, it was really after a year on the road that the Giant reached it's full maturity , making their second album 'Acquiring the Taste' the first album that was to feel like the finished item.<br /><br />There are eight numbers on 'Acquiring The Taste' all of which stand up on their own , but are much better suited to listen to as a complete album , as each track runs into the next , like new chapters of a page-turner novel that you just can't wait to get to and then when the next one starts you are already intrigued as to what the next bit is going to sound like . During the recording of this album the giants used over thirty different instruments between them , Gary Green the only member of the band allowed to stick to just one instrument . They used to also take all these different instruments with them on the road as well , which must have led to some very interesting stocktaking after gigs, and also used to cause much hilarity during the concert if a musician had to swap instruments half way through a song and upon putting the first one down would make a huge pantomime of trying to find the next one before the required solo was needed .<br /><br />The liner notes for 'Acquiring The Taste' are perhaps the best description of Gentle Giant's music, in their own words so to speak .<br /><br />\\" 'Acquiring the Taste' is the second phase of sensory pleasure .If you've gorged yourself on our first album, then relish the finer flavours ( We Hope) of this our second offering. It is our goal to expand the frontiers of contemporary music at the risk of being very unpopular. We have recorded each composition with one thought-that it should be unique, adventurous, and fascinating. It has taken every shred of our combined musical knowledge to achieve this. From the outset we have abandoned all preconceived thoughts on blatant commercialism. Instead we hope to give you something far more substantial and fulfilling. All you need to do is acquire the taste .\\"<br /><br />It may sound a little pretentious now , but considering that this was written nearly thirty five years ago, it does at least tell you that the giants heart was into trying to create something new and interesting. The music of Gentle Giant sounds as fresh and inventive today as it did then , cutting it's own swathe through the fields of modern music . Also the Giant's music is as indescribable now as it was then. The Gentle Giant had it's own particular musical swagger about it .<br /><br />I think for any body that would like to shake hands with the Giant musically this their second album is as good as any , although for a band, whose music was so complex,and who seemed to be constantly on the road in the early seventies,( Three month tours of America were common place, and any large festival in Europe with out Gentle Giant just was not complete), they were very prodigious in the studio  , producing between 1970 and 1975 eight albums.

They also released a fine live album Playing The Fool (1977). I admit that both quality and quantity dropped off after this , and time finally caught up with the Giant in 1980 when the band called it a day .<br /><br /> After a new burst of appreciation for the Giant in the late nineties there have been many re-releases and compilation albums released ( The best result from this is probably the double CD called 'Edge Of Twilight ' which culls most of the best tracks from the Giants six first albums , and gives you over two and a half hours of music )  Amazon now stocks over ninety Gentle Giant titles , and I'm afraid if you wish to hear  some of Gentle Giants music that is where you will have to go , as still today most music shops would not know quite how to market the Gentle Giant.

1400032717|5.0|If this book gives me a genuine peek inside the mind of an autistic boy, then I can say I've learned something along with reading a compelling, enjoyable story. Christopher is not a likable character in the traditional sense; he's difficult and potentially dangerous. But part of the value of this story is that nobody's perfect, just like in real life, and when people are facing tough challenges, they sometimes make big mistakes for which they have to work very hard to repair a little of the damage. Overall the story is bittersweet, perhaps more bitter than sweet, and sometimes funny, but I wouldn't say it's depressing or uplifting. The heavy weight of responsibility and consequences weighs down an otherwise whimsical story. Almost by accident, questions about the burden of caretaking and the value of life are raised. I have to admit the mystery of the dog had me going, and I never saw the truth coming.

B000A6CLL0|3.0|In the interest of helping the sagging ratings, the producers decided to give the show a season long story arc.  Introduced in the second season finale, the crew of Enterprise has a new mission.  Instead of exploring, the crew must now track down the Xindi and stop them from building a weapon that will destroy Earth.  The problem is, the area of space they are exploring is filled with strange anomalies that affect the crew in strange ways.  And if they don't stop the Xindi, the entire human population will be destroyed.<br /><br />With so much at stake, I was hoping this season would raise the series above the disappointing second season.  There were some very good episodes, but too many of them were still sub par.  In fact, many I had figured out completely by the second commercial break.  I was so bored it took my friends watching it with me to keep me going until the final episodes kicked the story into high gear and got me hooked again.<br /><br />Die-hard Trekkies will want this set to complete their collection.  Casual fans can just pass right on by and wait for the far superior final season.

B000000OAL|4.0|Queen is and has always been one of my favourite bands of all-time.  Not only are their songs great to listen to but each member is involved in the songwriting and each is a great musician in his own right.  As a guitarist myself I admire greatly and really rate Brian May's playing as well.  Very unique playing style and unmistakable tone.<br /><br />This 1991 album has been remastered and the sound quality is very good.  It's a very decent debut album and Brian May is the MVP here and continues to be over the next few albums until Freddie Mercury takes over more of the musical direction as well as the songwriting responsibilities towards their latter years.  This disc also has extra tracks which are good too with the exception perhaps of the \\"Liar\\" remix which is just filler.  I've just ordered a 2001 Japanese press remaster and I can't wait to hear the difference in sound quality.  Still, this is a very good buy at a decent price and quality.<br /><br />Recommended.
0307276902|1.0|Ouch. What a depressing read. It's OK but totally predictable and it comes off as phony and made up, which is strange for a book that purports to be so real. Also, this book aside, I think a more interesting tale would be an analysis of why Oprah consistently picks such negative, depressing books. She sees herself as the queen of positive thinking, but she urges readers to wallow around in negative novels. I don't get it. I wish she'd recommend something uplifting for a change.
B000000OAA|5.0|People talk about \\"Night At the Opera\\", \\"The Game\\" even \\"The Works\\" a lot more than about this one but this album is a pure gem and one of my favourites over the years that has managed to stand the test of time.  Even \\"The Game\\" can sound a little stale but like a true classic, this album still sounds great after all this time.<br /><br />My favourite Queen song is on this album and I think Brian May's best ever guitar solo is on that song as well.  \\"Killer Queen\\" is a truly great track and may well be their best ever single and I include the great \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" as well.  The opening track, \\"Brighton Rock\\" is a rock classic.  \\"Now I'm Here\\" is also on the first Greatest Hits album.  Another rock classic that's been covered by Guns N' Roses, \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" makes this an album full of great tracks.<br /><br />Definitely one of Queen's top 3 albums and highly recommended.
B000002TRM|2.0|A disjoint collection of demos, remixes, and live tracks, most of which surfaced as b-sides or ended up as bonus tracks to the recent remasters of the early Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog, \\"Out in L.A.\\" is of limited value.  I'll approach each of the three portions of the recording on its own. <br /> <br />The remixes I have little interest in, but this is pretty much a consistent thing with me, I'm generally not big on remixes.  Two of themixes (the extended dance mix of \\"Hollywood (Africa)\\" and the Ben Grosse remix of \\"Behind the Sun\\") make minimal adjustments to the piece, whereas \\"Higher Ground\\" receives a near rewrite in the 12\\" vocal mix (Flea's prominent slap bassline is totally removed) and the Pink Mustang mix of \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\" turns the piece into a hip hop beat and sound effects.  None of these really contribute much to the band's catalog. <br /> <br />The three live tracks fare a little better-- I've never cared for this recording of \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" (which also ended up on the \\"Mother's Milk\\" remaster)-- Kiedis always sounds a bit slurred and goofed on it, but the live recording of \\"Special Secret Song Inside\\" (sometimes referred to as \\"Party on Your P***y\\") is spectacular, full of energy, and \\"F.U.\\" (a setting of rather odd lyrics to Thelonious Monk's standard, \\"Bemsha Swing\\") is unique and goofy, and certainly worth a listen.  Neither of these two are available anywhere else. <br /> <br />The remainder of the album is given over to twelve demo recordings from 1982 from before the Peppers' debut album, recorded by the original band (Anthony Kiedis, Hillel Slovak, Flea, Jack Irons).  Seven of these tracks ended up on the \\"Red Hot Chili Peppers\\" and \\"Freaky Styley\\" reissues, limiting the value of this set further, but certainly the material put together is rather intriguin. <br /> <br />The majority of this material feels more in line with hardcore punk than it does with what the Chili Peppers would become known for-- pieces like \\"Police Helicopter\\" and the twelve second \\"You Always Sing the Same\\" would not have been out of place on a Dead Kennedys album.  A good chunk of the other stuff is bizarrely experimental, from the detailed arrangement of \\"Blues for Meister\\", featuring intertwining guitar lines and a trumpet solo from Flea, the call-and-response vocal chant \\"Flea Fly\\". <br /> <br />Overall, much of this material is intriguing, but getting the remasters gets you over half of the essential material on here.  The rest all but the most hardcore collector could probably live without.
B000002C1W|4.0|As everybody has probably seen, this album isn't generally received well by most, while, strangely, some seem to absolutely love this album. I'll agree with the group of the latter, althought I'll grant it 4 starts simply because, as much as I like it, Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall are just so much better. <br /> <br />Gilmour's playing is once again inspired, a trait that was largely missing from The Final Cut, as he wails and soars over such songs as \\"On the Turning Away\\" and \\"Learning to Fly\\" with grace that we've not seen from him since the scorching solo from Comfortably Numb.  <br /> <br />The songs are generally terrific, although the New Machine duo is rather weak. Signs of Life is a wonderful introduction to Learning to Fly...that chorus is awesome, reminds me of early Floyd. On the Turning Away is a nice ballad, not very inspired, but well executed. Dogs of War is a song that is usually looked down upon, but I think that its frantic pulse as well as Gilmour's screams are a fine addition to the album. Sorrow, the closer, is probably my favourite. Featuring some keyboards and vocals from a recently returned Rick Wright, this epic 9 minute closer steals (and closes) the show. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this to any Floyd fan, but we sure to pick up their  70s albums first if you're new to them. <br /> <br />Best songs: Learning to Fly, On the Turning Away, Dogs of War, Sorrow.
B000002MTR|3.0|Unfairly maligned by fans and critics alike, \\"One Hot Minute\\" is the Red Hot Chili Peppers album featuring former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.  With previous Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante a wreck of heroin addiction, the rest of the band threw him out, with Navarro eventually becoming the replacement.    In truth, Dave Navarro never quite fit into this band-- his style his a bit too aggressive and up front to be in a band with a bassist as distinctive and powerful as Flea.  The result is a lot of tension that makes the Chili Peppers meets Jane's sound sometimes superb and sometimes kind of a mess.    The good first though-- as a rule, these tend to be when the overtness and showiness of the Jane's Addiction.  Look no further than opener (and leadoff single) \\"Warped\\"-- explosive, aggressive, washed in layered guitars and exciting.  It works, it works really well.  Likewise you can see this influence on hit single \\"My Friends\\" (layered guitars and a sense of melodrama straight out of the Jane's book) and \\"Coffee Shop\\" (an explosive hard rock number with some jawdropping bass leads).    And certainly any discussion of intriguing music on this record can't overlook \\"Pea\\"-- a solo acoustic bass guitar and vocal piece by Flea about an encounter with a redneck that makes up for what it lacks in technique with earnestness.    But there's a mess here and there as well-- the overly melodramatic \\"Deep Kick\\" is just clumsy, \\"One Big Mob\\" and \\"One Hot Minute\\" always sounded positively sophomoric to me, \\"Walkabout\\" is a good idea that drags on endlessly, and \\"Transcending\\" just isn't as good as you want it to be.    Still, the album isn't nearly as bad as one would be led to believe, nor perhaps is it as good as its fans make it out to be, but certainly worth a listen.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining; this adventure/comedy has obvious references to Star Trek, and it succeeds incredibly well. The characters are very three-dimensional, well-developed, well-acted. They all did a superb job, especially Missy Pyle who plays the love interest. I liked each and every character. Incorporating the science fiction fan base into the story line is very original. And the imaginary tv series turned into reality by the friendly aliens is sheer genius on the part of the screenwriter. This is one of the few adventure movies that I can watch over and over. I wish they'd make a sequel!
B000002LQR|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers were poised for breakthrough in 1991 and had overcome quite a bit to get there.  After the artistic success of \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\", guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose and drummer Jack Irons decided to quit the band, leaving vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea in a difficult position.  But enlisting guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, the band managed to regroup and keep themselves on the edge of success with \\"Mother's Milk\\".  With this second chance, they entered the studio with producer Rick Rubin and engineer Brendan O'Brien they recorded what would be their breakthrough, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magick\\". <br /> <br />Admittedly, it was not an album that would be easy to record without alienating their fanbase-- a couple decisions were made by the band that no doubt would begin the sellout labels being applied, not the least of which was diversifying their style.  Taken in context of the band's history, the ballads and different forms on the album are not entirely unprecedented, and quite honestly, if one is going to view \\"Under the Bridge\\" as a sellout, then perhaps the title track or \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\" or \\"My Lovely Man\\" should be as well, but since neither of them were commercially successful, they don't get thought of that way.  What the band did was not sit contentedly in the current college radio movement, but rather anticipate the next sound in a couple different directions.  The album feels edgy and groundbreaking, even as it is tight and well honed as a result.  The other decision critical to the sound, though a bit more subtle, was Flea's decision to abandon the slap-and-pop sound he was known for-- evidentally he was unhappy with the host of imitators.  Instead, he performed in an aggressive, funky, but not slapped style pretty much throughout the album.  Also of note is Kiedis seemingly to gain more confidence in his voice, singing far more than rapping, and really carrying melodies better. <br /> <br />So the result of all this?  A surprisingly eclectic album moving through a number of styles-- it seems heavily informed by \\"Freaky Styley\\" era deep grooves, pieces like \\"If You Have To Ask\\" and \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" are soaked in funk, but with the addition of a backing vocalist with a strong enough voice to carry detailed harmonies in John Frusciante, the pieces breathe a bit easier.  The band continues their evolution of the funk/punk/metal sound as well, turning out several pieces that would be enormously infuential to early 2000s metal-- hit \\"Give it Away\\" (although I confess I never understood why, it's not one of the better pieces by the band in this form) and explosive funk/punk \\"Suck My Kiss\\" (a minor hit in its own right) are probably the better examples of this. <br /> <br />But new directions were pursued all over the place, allowing the superb playing of the band to breathe-- opener \\"The Power of Equality\\" takes the funk/rap sounds on the verses and blends it with a funky, sung chorus.  \\"Breaking the Girl\\", \\"I Could Have Lied\\" and hit \\"Under the Bridge\\" introduce a softer, melodic, acoustic side, to varying degrees of success.  Each piece has its own merits, the latter in particular deserving its success given that it is a delicate, well constructed, and brilliantly arranged piece, with superb harmonies, great building structure, and a deeply heartfelt vocal (about Kiedis' own struggles with heroin) all make for a great formula.  The band also reaches out quite a bit, exploring a more straight rock vein with the superb \\"My Lovely Man\\" (about Slovak), intermixing New Orleans jazz into their funk on \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\", and putting together an epic piece exploring almost all their sounds in \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\". <br /> <br />So what's wrong with the album?  It's a bit long, truthfully, and cutting a few pieces off of it, even osme cuts that are pretty good like the title track or \\"The Righteous & the Wicked\\" or some of the more lifeless pieces (the superbly titled \\"Funky Monks\\", unmemorable \\"Naked in the Rain\\") would have drastically improved the album.   <br /> <br />These small flaws aside, this is an unnervingly good album, well worth investigation, and probably the best introduction to the Chili Peppers. Recommended.
B000069HJI|5.0|This is a magnificent masterpiece (1982). Every song is a treasure. The albums from Crime of the Century to this one before Roger Hodgson's departure (aiming to going on solo)are worthwhile,but \\"Famous last words\\" is my number one. <br />It contains my one of my all-time favourite Supertramp songs: It's raining again, that was a hit (the others are A soapbox Opera from \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\" and If everyone was listening from \\"Crime of the Century\\").  <br />In general, the frequent use of keys instrument(organ,piano or keyboard)is a trademark of this band in my opinion,but this record was focused on piano. Roger Hodgson with the exception of \\"My kind of lady\\" didn't use the falsetto here. <br />I don't know if the cd's booklet shows it, because I own it in vinyl: the group members as equilibrists on colourful ropes. (Curious) <br /> <br />The other tracks: <br /> <br />Crazy: \\"I'll sing you little song that makes you feel good\\", it really makes me feel good. It's incredibly catchy, espacially at the end of the chorus were Roger sings almost like this: b biou da ta,b biou da ta....(I'm only immitating).Great opener.  <br /> <br />Put down your old brown shoes: Roger and Richard Davies sing together in this track. The rhythm is clutching. It will make you <br />get up from your chair and clap with them. <br /> <br />Bonnie: Rick Davies sings for Bonnie,the beloved woman of the title. No comments: excellent composition. <br /> <br />Know who you are: The slowest. We can hear a sad vocal by Hodgson. It's sweet. The lyrics give advice to a person for releasing the bright side of the personality.  <br /> <br />My kind of lady: It was another hit and it still plays on the radio. Roger and Rick share the vocals and the halfs of the song are sung on different tones. The higher notes of the saxophone start the change. Proficient song. <br /> <br />C'est le bon: As catchy as the opener with Roger's touch.This is so strong and marvellous.... <br />\\"C'est le bon, sailing on and on ; C'est le bon ,sailing on and on....\\" It has use of acoustic guitar (as we can see in Give a little bit from \\"even in the quietest moments\\") and air instrumets different from sax. <br /> <br />Waiting so long: An insteresting piece sung by Davies mainly. The ending features some guitar solos (slow). <br /> <br />Don't leave me now: Roger takes the vocal here. The same note combo is repeated on piano throughout the track, but I like it and think it's beautiful. The lyrics are clear: Don't leave me alone in this crazy world , for his lover. <br /> <br />The whole album is majestic, but my favourites are songs 1, 3 ,6, 7,  and 9. <br />
0425105709|4.0|One Two Buckle My Shoe is one of the more contrived of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels but its twisted loops are definately part of the fun.  The author does play around with politics in her conservative, often very naive, way but handles it much more smoothly than she did in her early twenties spy novels.  The solution to the killer is both predicatable and satisfying as Christie crawls right up to the preposterous and then pulls back just a little.  This is one of the Poirot novels that could have used Hastings a foil and his prescence is sadly missed, particularly as everyone at a certain dentist's office on a particular morning has something to hide and it would have been fun to read Hastings switching prime suspects with each new revelation.  All in all, not a classic Christie but an interesting one.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|This \\"Ultimate Director's Edition\\" represents the way that Hill originally intended to cut the film when it was released including the use of comic graphics to introduce each section and act as transitions between scenes. I've seen some criticism of this as a \\"rip off\\" but having seen the DVD, I didn't think it was at all. As Hill notes this version of \\"The Warriors\\" was what he had in mind when he first directed the film. Hill wanted the chance to make this much closer to the way he originally envisioned the film. There's no commentary track because Hill doesn't believe in doing them.<br /><br />A gang called the Warriors is falsely accused of assassinating Cyrus (Roger Hill) a gang leader trying to unite all the gangs by the actual killer. Shot at a meeting for all the gangs where Cyrus was suggesting they unite vs. fight each other,  the Warriors led by Swan (Michael Beck)  must get his fellow Warriors (Dorsey Wright, Brian Tyler, David Harris, Tom McKitterick) back safely to their home surf in Coney Island. Swan's job is complicated by the fact that Ajar (James Remar) challenges him as the new leader of the gang. Unfortunately the Warriors must brave the streets and every other gang member who is out to kill them to avenge the murder of Cyrus.<br /><br />A beautiful, rich transfer for \\"The Warriors\\" is a real plus for this set. The film was previously available in a no frills widescreen presentation in its original cut. Grain is readily apparent in the film but that's to be expectated given that much of the film was shot at night with high speed film. The colors are rich and deep with excellent skin tones. The blacks are rich and dark as a great cup of black coffee. The original mono track is available here but the highlight is the 5.1 remix. The remix makes good use of the 5.1 format spreading the action around the speakers. An excellent job from Paramount and director Hill in putting this fine set together.<br /><br />Walter Hill appears in an introduction discussing his intention in recutting \\"The Warriors\\" and bringing it closer to his original vision. There are four featurettes included. The first \\"The Warriors: The Beginning\\" features Producer Larry Gordon discussing how he discovered Sol Yorick's novel. He was spinning around a paperback holder and his imagination immediately was captured by the cover. He optioned it and approached Walter Hill about directing a film version based on the cover. The novel is supposedly more sociological. Writer David Shaber based his screenplay on the image from the cover and the 4th century Greek writer Xenophon. When the western that Hill and Gordon had planned fell apart, Gordon suggested that Hill direct \\"The Warriors\\". Hill took the overall look of the film from the comic book genre when the studio wouldn't let him do a realistic gang drama with African-American and Hispanic actors. Hill rewrote the script going in the comic book direction knowing that it would be more likely to be made that way. Hill discovered actor Michael Beck when he screened a film featuring Sigorney Weaver. James Remar also shares the story of his audition and how he impressed Hill by pretending he was handcuffed to the table and lifted it as he tried to escape. Most of the major cast members are interviews in this terrific featurette.<br /><br />\\"The Warriors: The Battleground\\" focuses on the production issues and challenges that Hill and his team faced with this low budget movie. Shot on location in New York, Hill couldn't get most crews to work with him. They flew in a assistant director from Los Angeles when they no longer had their first A.D.  Assistant Director David O. Sosna had to prove himself because most L.A. directors weren't really well thought of when it came to action scenes shot on the streets of New York. Nights shooting on the subways proved to be a bit of a challenge as well.<br />***<br />\\"The Warriors: The Way Home\\" focuses on the battles that are choreographed for The Warriors' journey home. Hill wanted the battle with The Furies to look like a Kurosawa fight sequence. In \\"The Warriors: The Phenomenon\\" the cast and crew discuss the post production experience of the film including the decision to go with a synthesizer score. We also find out about having Orson Welles narrate the opening. Unfortunately, the agreement with Welles fell apart. Hill mentions when he first found out about the audience reaction to the film as well as the critical reaction when it was released. What killed the business was the fear that gang violence would break out in theaters. While some of that concern was founded the studio panicked and pulled advertising on the film. The film continued to do good business despite all of this. There's also an illustration of the original opening sequence for the film which was cut. We also get deleted scenes for the film none of which would have improved the film to any larger degree. The original theatrical trailer (which isn't in the best shape) is included as well as previews for other Paramount films. The only mistake that Paramount made here was not making this into a seamlessly branching edition with both the original theatrical version and Hill's \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\". One deleted scene is included in the featurette portion with Hill discussing why he cut the sequence.<br /><br />If you're a fan of \\"The Warriors\\" you may or may not be happy with this version of the film. Hill has changed the film slightly to bring it closer to his original vision of the film. The image and sound quality is top notch with a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround mix for the film as well as a 2.0 mix. Hill hates doing commentary tracks and is very uncomfortable even discussing his films in featurettes (he feels it robs the films of the magic) but this is a film that is close to his heart and we can thank Paramount for convincing him to do the special features and restructuring the film to his original vision.The Furies to look like a Kurosawa fight sequence.

B000A0GP4K|4.0|While watching Martin Scorcese's Dylan biopic, \\"No Direction Home,\\" I kept wondering just what might have happened if all of the obsessed Dylan-philes from the early `60s had known all the facts as they are presented here. At the time of Dylan's fairly sudden rise to fame, he was surrounded by so many myths - many of them self-perpetuated - that the true Dylan fan of the time could only believe what he heard (or not). This naturally lent Dylan a mysterious aura that only made him more attractive to the fans who wanted to figure him out. More importantly, it also lent his writing that same aura of mystery, leaving every single person who came in contact with his words to apply their own interpretations, or scratch their heads in awe, wondering what all of it could possibly mean. This method of self-mythification worked brilliantly for Dylan, although it also backfired in some ways, especially when it led to people rifling through his garbage for clues, or assigning their own opinions and meanings to words that he did not intend. Nonetheless, it was fascinating to watch the contemporary Joan Baez explain (rather saucily) how Dylan would write some verse that even he considered mysterious, then show it to Joan Baez to ask her opinion. When she offered her own interpretations, Dylan was pleased, and commented that years from now, people would probably still be doing the exact same thing.<br /><br />Watching the modern day Dylan remove much of the myth that surrounded his early days is perhaps the most fascinating element of this 2-part biography of Dylan's first foray into fame. His lucid explanations of how his thought process functioned back then would have been a Rosetta Stone for the obsessed Dylan fans, but I wonder if they would have believed what they heard, even if they knew that it came straight from Dylan's mouth. After all, they already sensed that he was `colorizing' aspects of his past and so might have considered the source untrustworthy, but more importantly, they probably didn't want to see the myth disturbed. The truth would have made everything so plebian. From today's perspective, though, the truth is just as fantastic as the myth.<br /><br />Episode one of \\"No Direction Home\\" covers the time period from Dylan's youth in Hibbing, Minnesota to the fame following the release of his third album. A lot has been made of Dylan's constant reinvention, but few people concede that in the beginning, he reinvented himself with virtually every record. Here, Dylan himself makes it clear that the changes were a combination of deliberation and a reaction to the times. His first album was a quickly assembled hodgepodge of random influences, painting him as an adequate folk singer. The second album launched his career as a serious songwriter, with thought-provoking words and melodies that could be `beautified' by Peter, Paul and Mary or Trini Lopez. A rather telling (and amusing) moment occurs when a music publisher takes credit for making Dylan famous because he managed to distribute his songs among so many different artists. It's a ludicrous claim, but it has an element of truth to it, too, since middle-class America is unlikely to have accepted Dylan without middle-of-the-road artists softening the rougher edges of his own performance.<br /><br />My only complaint here is with Scorcese's means of assembling some of the footage. Perhaps sensing that he would lose some of his audience if he didn't let us see some `electrified' Dylan, he continually cuts into the future, showing us footage of Dylan and the Band before a hostile English audience. The result is disconcerting, especially since it was usually irrelevant to the topic that was previously being discussed. I think it might have been ultimately more effective to watch Dylan evolve organically into his electrified phase, since it would probably better convey the shock and sense of betrayal felt by his older fans. Instead, it is confusing, especially for younger fans who wish to understand this very important phase of musical history, and it will almost certainly soften the sudden impact of the change when it is covered in part two of this biopic. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating assemblage of rare footage, myth debunking, and revisionist history that does not let go. I can't wait to see part two, and I only wish that Scorcese and Dylan would consider continuing their collaboration, all the way up to the present day.

B000AXSN5G|1.0|I listen to this cd on his website and found it to be quite a bore it sounds like a copy cat version of his better cds but not in a good way. Before you get this make sure you have After the Gold Rush, Comes a Time, Harvest, and On the Beach these are way better albums that show Young's mellow side more effectively.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I absolutely love this cd, it is different enough from everything out there that I feel absolutely refreshed. It is dancy with enough rock and emo feel to be the perfect combo. Like others have said it is similar to some artists but at the same time totally its own new style and indescribable. If you are looking for something new in your cd player I highly recommend it.

Harley has his own problems like overcoming the death of his father and getting along with a snobby brown noser Kent Gregory (Cary Elwes).

0553573403|4.0|Hey, I don't speak Klingon, own a 12-sided die or anything, but I must say, this is a damned good book.<br /><br />Let me begin by stating that I am NOT a fantasy fan. Dungeons and Wizards have always seemed a bit nerdy to me. I just can't bring myself to actually walk up to the counter at a bookstore and hand the clerk a book with dragons and sorcerers on the cover.<br /><br />As a teenager I was an avid reader of SF, though. By the way, why DO they lump Science Fiction and Fantasy together? Why not create a Western/Mystery category?<br /><br />Anyways, I've only recently gotten back to reading fiction again and found this book on a list of the supposedly \\"greatest SF/Fantasy books of all time.\\" It was ranked number one ahead of Dune, Foundation, etc. Being skeptical I bought it (I mean, DUNE?...c'mon)<br /><br />Things start of a bit slowly, the series will span thousands of pages, after all, but once you get well under way you will find yourself increasingly engrossed in the very detailed world that the author has created. After finishing the first book you will probably want to run out and buy the second--Clash of Kings.<br /><br />For those of you like me who didn't play Dungeons and Dragons in the library at lunch in high school and are therefore a little unsure if this book is for you, let me just reassure you that it reads more like historical fiction from the middle ages than actual fantasy. There is VERY little in the way of magic and mythical creatures running around. There will be some of these things but far less than, say, the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />And, as far as I know, there aren't any shadowmancers on the cover.
B000078DOI|5.0|Even John Frusciante said that this is their most influential album. <br /> <br />Anyone that criticizes this album is an idiot, and does not have a real clue about the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'm not saying this from a fan standpoint, but from a musician's standpoint. This is their most influential album; the album that got them to for the first time to expand their musical diversity and sophistication; this is the album that laid down the blueprint of the traditional Red Hot Chili Peppers sound, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sound that everyone loves.  <br /> <br />This is before Stadium Arcadium. This is before By The Way. Californication. One Hot Minute. Blood Sugar Sex Magik. This is a musical adventure that is more daring that what any band then and now has put out there, an album displaying spirit and brashness that did not care what the media or the pop mainstream listening  fan base would think; it was a form of their expression. Their expression.  <br /> <br />It starts out with the semi-autobiographical Good Time Boys, a five minute crunching funk rocker that sets the tone and the mood of this album. It's followed by the infamous Stevie Wonder cover Higher Ground. The horn driven and energetic Subway To Venus follows (which would definitely influence the Peppers for years to come), along with the manic and hyper Magic Johnson and Nobody Weird Like Me (the latter featuring Flea's most complicated and manic basslines); the touching Knock Me Down follows, while it is still a hard rocker, it is done with a sense of sensitivity with  Vicki Calhoun's background vocals that makes this track one of the best on here; a couple of songs that would be telling what's to come follows - the funky and jazzy Taste The Pain and the dirty Stone Cold Bush (the latter featuring an audio sample of an orgasm). From there comes Fire, a Jimi Hendrix cover feature Irons and Slovak (it was recorded before Slovak's death); Pretty Little Ditty, one of the finest three minute instrumentalsof all time showed the Peppers melodical sense before the likes of Californication and By The Way; rounding out the album is the punked out Punk Rock Classic, the steamy, jazz-funk mix of Sexy Mexican Maid (another foretelling song), and the explosive 5 minute epic closer Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky showed another level of the Peppers musical capabilities. <br /> <br />It is a true music album to say the least; over 20 different musicians and singers were featured on Mother's Milk including Vicki Calhoun (who did background vocals on Higher Ground, Knock Me Down, and Johnny Kick A Hole In The Sky) and Patrick English and Keith Barry (Tree), who along with Flea (at trumpet) served as the horn section. This would showcase by far the musicial diversity of the Peppers that would be showcased on later albums. <br /> <br />This is the Peppers right when they broke into the mainstream; the Peppers that was brash and all about expressing themselves; before the pop sensitivies and the ballads, before the diamond albums, and all of the number one hits, this was who the Peppers were. To me this is really a very artistic record. <br /> <br /> <br />BONUS TRACK NOTES: <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are pretty good as well. The two biggest highlights are: the original long version of Knock Me Down is a bit better and more touching than the one that made the original album; and Castles Made of Sand is from one of their live performances, which is something that has, always, and will be a staple of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B000002KHH|5.0|I'm sorry if your a metal head and this isn't in your collection then please right now look at yourself and tell yourself you are not a metalhead because this album is heavy metal itself. This was the 2nd true heavy metal album ever created. If anyone disagrees with me then you are a fool Black Sabbath are the true fathers of heavy metal not Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple. This band created a whole new art for all of us to reflect upon these men are the heavy metal gods. I suppose I spend to much time exhaulting them instead of revewing the album, but there is no stop to exhaulting Black Sabbath for what they've done. They were the first and always will be. <br /> <br />Now this album like I said is the basic outlook for any heavy metal album. You have your ballad, your well known single, your instrumental, and every other song thats head splitting, toothe aching, gut ripping pure heavy metal. This was one of my first heavy metal albums and will always be my perfect thought of a heavy metal album.

B000002BMV|5.0|Although Journey had become one of the premier U.S. hard rock bands with their previous three studio releases (Infinity, Evolution, and Departure), it was on Escape where the band's popularity would explode. Just as Steve Perry's soaring vocals had brought a new dimension to the band on Infinity, it was new keyboardist Jonathan Cain's melodic lines that would help bring the band superstardom on Escape. While some longtime fans may have cried sellout, Cain's contribution strengthened the band's already impressive material. Escape plays like a greatest hits album as every single track is top notch.<br /><br />The best known tracks would become the band's first three Top 10 singles. \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" is an awesome track that still sounds fresh, featuring memorable hooks, great vocals from Perry, and a melodic solo from guitarist Neal Schon. The mid-tempo \\"Who's Crying Now\\" is one of the band's best songs featuring Cain's memorable piano line, Schon's long closing solo, and excellent bass playing from Ross Valory. \\"Open Arms\\" is among the best power ballads ever recorded as well as Perry's finest vocal performance. Other ballads such as the dramatic \\"Mother Father\\" and the Top 20 single \\"Still They Ride\\" are also very good. But Escape is not a pop album. \\"Stone In Love\\" and \\"Lay It Down\\" are melodic rockers featuring more memorable riffs and solos from Schon and Perry's stellar vocals. \\"Dead Or Alive\\" and \\"Keep On Runnin'\\" are the heaviest tracks which showcase the band's soaring harmonies and Steve Smith's kinetic drumming. Finally, the title track, which features more memorable hooks than most bands put on an album, is one of the best hard rock songs ever recorded. One of the best albums of the '80s, Escape cemented Journey's reputation as one of rock's greatest bands. Highly recommended.

B0000025T6|5.0|Springsteen's \\"Nebraska\\" was one of his least successful albums commercially, to date having sold, I believe, fewer than a million  copies.<br /><br />Among his fans, however, this CD is regarded with a kind of reverent awe:  it is unquestionably Springsteen's best work, exploring dark, introspective themes that he had never visited before, and has not since.<br /><br />It's just unbelievable.  I'm not really such a big fan of \\"The Boss,\\" either.  But this CD has a coherence, grace, and power that defy description.<br /><br />The lyrics will have you slitting your wrists, though.
B0000035E7|4.0|This album is a classic in the grunge genre. It has all of the facets that made Nirvana such an insanely huge success: It's raw, simple, and catchy. While being somewhat under-produced, unlike \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\", There is an honest charm in it's garage band feel. Certainly a wonderful glimpse into the beginnings of one of the biggest bands ever. Songs like \\"School\\", and \\"Negative Creep\\" showcase the heavier side of the album, while \\"About a girl\\" provides a hint of the pop mastery they were later to revel in. All in all, a classic look into the early workings of one of musics most tortured and brilliant minds.
B000AL730O|5.0|In every decade, musical critics have wrote musical eulogies for McCartney proclaiming him to be but a washed up has been. At those critical moments, Paul surprises the public at large and will produce products worthy of praise and laureates. Such was the case in 1997 with Flaming Pie. Once again it's the case with his new arrival. CHAOS validates Mc Cartney musical title as pop genius. The track listing is sleek and musically delightful. The lyrical content is pure McCartney. He delivers a vocal performance that sounds fresh, timeless and casual. Sadly, the one thing missing from this CD is the absence of Linda's harmonies. Her often offbeat vocals perfectly supported McCartney's great pop choruses. Nevertheless, Chaos is destined to measure in as a timeless release. It is defiantly his strongest product in recent years. A worthy purchase for his fans as well as lovers of Pop music.
B000000OSE|4.0|Hot spots on this album include \\"Right next door to hell\\", \\"Double talkin jive\\", & their cover of \\"Live and let die\\". Their are not too many duds. I would say this album, much more than part 2, hits the creative nail on the head for this band. Axl's provocative lyrics, Slash's bluesy metal guitar riffs, & the drumming of newly recruited Matt Sorum, formerly of the Cult, Along with Duff's laid back bass thumping combine to create a unique sound for a unique band on this one. The only unfortunate part is that you can almost feel the ripples of discontent that eventually caused the dissolution of this once revered unit.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|The following review is for the subtitled version of the film (which as of when this review was written, is the only version of the film out). I have to say, the art was breath taking... the story was a bit confusing, but even for a general final fantasy fan with no experience in playing FF7, this movie is absolutely amazing... if that's you and you're a reasonably intelligent open minded person then this review is for you.<br /><br />I realize that many people would like a movie which is clear from beginning to end. You weren't going to get that with this - the movie is target only to individuals through gaming circles, likewise the true target audience was people who have already played the FF7 game (whereas Spirits Within for instance was for just about anyone and was marketed as a major motion picture).<br /><br />Keeping that in mind there's no reason to complain about the lack of explanation in the movie. Certainly one could wish there was more but it isn't necessary, take the film for what it is and if you still don't like it then write a descriptive review of what exactly you didn't like. I've seen a number of quality independent films and films that were marketed in a similar way and so I didn't mind the lack of clarity. There's only so much you could explain in a movie about characters with such a heavy back story while still remaining in the realm of entertaining.<br /><br />The bulk of the story is complicated to follow as past reviewers have noted because the movie works on an emotional level to flesh out Cloud's character and bring to light things that were still haunting him from the time of the game *and* prior to that (the game's back story, if you will). Many things are not clearly stated in the movie such as the past relationship between Sephiroth and Cloud and how Sephiroth often uses Cloud's tormenting memories as a way to weaken him (this for instance is illustrated in one of the last segments in the movie where Sephiroth says, \\"I will not remain just a memory\\" - threatening Cloud, reminding him that he has the Jenova Cells in him as well). On an emotional level without ever playing the game the plot itself is a 4/5 depending on whether or not you can supplement what you've watched with outside reference material.<br /><br />How do you figure out the back story once you've seen the movie or prior to seeing the movie? Online encyclopedias if you haven't played Final Fantasy 7. Tedious? Not at all, the movie makes such research worthwhile for people who haven't played the game but are interested in fleshing out their knowledge of the events and relationships that made themselves apparent in the film. Why would you watch a movie that you'll have to look up information for later? Because the characters are so lovable they are worth it - they'll make you want to play the game if you haven't, and the emotional ties solidified in this movie - I assure you - will strengthen as you see Cloud and his friends suffer in the game (as cruel as that sounds).<br /><br />Familiar with digital animation, I should point out once more than this film doesn't just have spectacular graphics it *has* cutting edge graphics which should be praised and awarded. The movie simply isn't that much money for what it is, and for what it is it can easily become one of the best anime's you've seen to date (especially if you supplement your viewing experience with some background information if you don't have it already, and if you do then keep an open mind about the film).<br /><br />And the music? Forget about it... perfect! Hard rock/industrial sort mixed with some Final Fantasy-favorite tunes, and some other lovely songs. Great with the fast paced action (negative reviews about action being too fast paced? Grow up, unless of course you think it interferes with the cohesiveness of the film).<br /><br />I can only hope that you - the reader - can enjoy and appreciate this film as much as I have. I realize that many people have negative views about films based on the fact that it has been hyped up in gaming circles and that they've been anticipating it for a while (this happens whenever you mix diehard fans with a new movie featuring the characters they love in it), but keep an open mind and you'll love it.ve negative views about films based on the fact that it has been hyped up in gaming circles and that they've been anticipating it for a while (this happens whenever you mix diehard fans with a new movie featuring the characters they love in it), but keep an open mind and you'll love it.
B000000OSG|3.0|While in my younger years I was a pretty big \\"Guns\\" fan, it's lessened now that I'm approaching thirty. This album contains some extremely bright spots, such as \\"Yesterdays\\", and \\"Civil war\\", two songs that will go in the \\"classic\\" category for even the most casual fan. But there are rough spots also, songs that seem to be little more than filler. Worth it to check it out, especially at these low prices.
B00000K19E|5.0|Aside from Keanu's acting, which is TOO criticized, there is not a greater film (well Sci-Fi anyway) that exists to this day. The story for the Matrix is incredible, it makes you think and wonder about the world. When I saw previews for this movie back in 1999, I thought to myself, \\"What the heck is that supposed to be about?\\" Later, I discovered that it was an incredible movie with great special effects and great storyline that was executed almost perfectly. I really have a love for cinematography, and this movie was filmed very well. All action movie should first have a storyboard to show camera angles, in my opinion. Andy and Larry ae both geniuses and I can't wait to see their next movie, V for Vendetta.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever. The music is palatable for people who are not even RHCP fans. Such a great mixture of funk, soul, & rock. There are so many different influences heard on this album. Something for everybody. Lyrics are well put together, socially conscious. The most radio friendly early RHCP album, but still one of their top two in my estimation. \\"If you have to ask\\", and \\"I could have lied\\" are stand out hits.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|My God...it was beautiful...amazing design...incredible fights...I wanted to cry when I saw it. It was fantastic. I would say that although the story wasn't quite FF7 calibur, it was still very good, and SE did a good job of staying true to the name of FFVII. The only reason I give this 4 stars, is because of the seemingly rushed story. Man, I couldn't believe how well the fights were done, it was so cool. I've gone back and watched them over and over, some in slo-mo, just so I could grasp all the minute movements and sequences. I loved seeing all the characters back together again. I will definitely buy this on DVD or UMD!
B00008OLIC|5.0|Maybe the best album from the 80's. Can't deny. Rock 'n' roll with attitude. It's the thing these guys handle. Maybe not the most talented guys but they rock.
0307276902|5.0|I'm a fiction suspense junkie.  Matthew Farrell's Winter Hill and James Patterson's Lifeguard were a couple of my favorite books of the summer.  I tried A Million Little Pieces based on a combination of Oprah selecting it and the first chapter I read online.  It never disappointed.  Powerful, well-written, and in it's own way a page-turner.  I highly recommend this book and have found my first favorite of the Fall.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This movie is very grisly!! Its very sick and bloody....and thats why I like it. But I cant stand to watch that little kid get thrown around in the beginning. That part is sick.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Good acting, smart dialogue, compelling stories.  This tale of intertwined lives touches me on many levels. I cannot recommend this movie enough.  <br /> <br />Mostly the people and the stories seem so very real. Nothing over the top, nothing forced.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Simply stated, Firefly was the best TV show ever made.
B00005JMEW|5.0|With Kill Bill, you have a line drawn, those who love it and those who hate it. Either you like it for it's cool action, sharp and witty dialogue, creative and fun characters, and well choreographed style and well shot cinematography. Or, you hated it for it's over the top violence, simple story, and interesting casting. Either way, this is one well done film. Now, there is no doubt that Tarantino is one of modern times best filmmakers. He is a noncomforist filmmaker of sorts, who still sides on a more independent note than trying to put out the Next Big Thing. And Kill Bill is his message of this: rather than trying to create a pop culture flick that will make tons of bucks, he's created something he can enjoy. In other words, this is Tarantino's fanboy film.  <br /> <br />The film itself is qute simple. A former assassin goes on a rampage of revenge to kill the man who took away the life she wanted to have. But in retrospect, the film is more about it's characters than what they do. Uma Thurmans 'Bride' is not just a one dimensional killing machine. She's a woman who lost her baby. An ex-assassin who just may be the world's deadliest woman. She's someone who you could be good friends with, as long as you don't get on her bad side. While most of the other characters aren't nearly as well developed, they do at least have interesting enough backstories to them. And, at the very least they are interesting.  <br /> <br />One other thing you know you can get from a Tarantino film is great writing, and thats no less true here. The film sparkles with great dialogue. Whether it's Uma's narration (which are very well voiced) or the exchanges and banter between friend's and foe (Sonny Chiba's scene being one of my favorites), there is a bounty of great lines here. Yes, some of it seems a bit out of place, but the style is just so darn cool, you can't help but go along with it. <br /> <br />As for the action, it's some of the bloodiest to have graced the screen in a while, but it's also quite stylish. The choreography is well done and the fights are creative, ranging from teenage girl with a chained and spiked ball (resembling something out of an anime) to a fight in a homemmakers suburban house, the battles are entertaining and spark the imagination.  <br /> <br />Now, I will say, this movie isn't for everyone. Yes, it is overly violent. Yes, it does have an unusual style that is mostly in service of Tarantino's own fandom. But, the film is cool, stylish, and one great time. And, if you like Quentin's previous works, you're in for a treat, because this is one of his best to date. Now stop reading this, and go get this movie....now!
B000ASDFJU|1.0|So this is basically a giant slap in the face for anybody who went out and bought all the seasons separately, extremely crappy packaging and all. <br />Gee, thanks HBO.  Last time I'll be purchasing anything from you. <br />Signed, <br />One bitter freaking consumer.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The first Kill Bill was a pure delight. At the end, one wondered where the series would go next. I was surprised to find that the second volume was different in many ways from the first. The over the top and modernly stylized fights from the first film were replaced by old fashioned, chinese oriented action. There is also a much more western feel to the film. Overall, it just had a completely different feel, yet, it didn't betray it's first half. The characters were still faithful to themselves from the first go around, and the dialogue didn't seem to change much in tone.  <br /> <br />This volume picks up right where the first one ends. The Bride is off to finish off the last of those who betrayed her, with it all ending with Bill. The story doesn't sway in the least, and in fact, it seems to be a bit simpler this time around. There are a few more twists in this one, but nothing too shocking. And of course, we finally learn the Brides true name, as well as we finally get to see the face of Bill.  <br /> <br />It is debatable which of the two is actually the better film, but that depends on what it is you like more. This film replaces the modern, city-like environments with more western like environments: open desert, vista backgrounds, and mexican countryside. It certainly does give the movie a different feel, but this works for the better. The series is diversified to a greater extent by showing the multifaceted personalities of the many characters. We get a good feel for who Bud is, and to a greater extent, Bill. Like the first movie, the characters are well told, not just through their dialogue, but through their actions and surroundings.  <br /> <br />The strong point, aside from character, is once again the writing. One of the best chunks of lines from any Tarantino film is in this movie, and it's about Superman nonetheless (you'll know what I mean when you see it). Elle, who was a so-so character in the first film, is much more fleshed out in this one. She takes on a much more despised role here (which is a good thing), and therefore, become a character we're much more willing to see. Pai Mei is also one of the best characters to come around in years, with his old-chinese-man look and foul mouth. Overall, the characters of this film are just generally more interesting, except for Go-go, who still holds a special place in this fans heart.  <br /> <br />One thing that is debatable is whether or not the tone of the film, which changed dramatically, is a good thing or a bad thing. Some would say that the tone of this film is much better, but I for one think that it moved a little too slow. The first film moved with lightning pace, never taking a moment to stop and rest. This film however, takes its time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just a little less enthusiastic than the first one. <br /> <br />Just as in the first volume, V2 does an excellent job of finishing the series up. It doesn't betray it's characters or feel, while still being different enough to be a film on it's own right. It's just as stylish, just as well written, and simply put, a film that is just as good, maybe even better, than the first.

B00006FM77|5.0|I can't stop listening to this set!  Every time I listen, I hear something different.  I wish these concerts had been filmed.  I would love to see the original band, especially Terry Kath, perform again, and witness the excitement of the performances...
B000020617|4.0|If your a, fan then you will like this cd. If your not I suggest starting with their self titles album and \\"The Colour and the Shape\\".
B00000K31V|5.0|When I unearthed a bargain price VHS copy of \\"eXistenZ\\" I had no recollection of having even heard of the film. At that price and with a cast that included Sarah Polley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Ian Holm I figured, why not experiment? Unlike most of my video experiments I fell immediately into the story and really enjoyed the film. It is easy to watch and while Polley and Holm have small parts, Leigh is on screen for almost the entire film. Which is probably why she elected to do this instead of \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\". Her co-star is Jude Law in what I would rate his all-time best performance.    Although I was very impressed I don't recommend \\"eXistenZ\\" for everyone. It could be described as an anti-\\"Matrix\\". Not in an intentional sense since they were being made at the same time, but rather in their respective target audiences. So if you seek it out because you really liked \\"The Matrix\\", you may be disappointed.    It has a fairly narrow target audience and because of this it was not aggressively distributed in the U.S. and did much better in Europe. Generally those who really connected to \\"The Matrix\\" will find it insufficiently manipulative (requiring too much viewer self-analysis and participation) while those who hated \\"The Matrix\\" will hate it for being too manipulative. So if you found \\"Matrix\\" generally intriguing but did not go ga-gah over it, you should make it a point to check out \\"eXistenZ\\".    It is not really sci-fi or action adventure but a psychological thriller (just as \\"The Hole\\" is not a horror film but a psychological thriller). It places Kurt Vonnegut's theme \\"you are what you pretend to be so be careful what you pretend to be\\" into an allegorical tale of shifting reality. Do we ever actually exercise free will? Does escaping from reality contribute to reality getting worse, in actuality or in our perception? You are meant to internalize this theme and to ask yourself these questions.    My only real complaint is that the final twist (unlike the earlier twists) does not click into place when you first see it nor later as you work backwards to find clues and foreshadowing elements that support this element. Without these the twist is silly and unnecessary. While it does not ruin all that has gone before it seems like just a lame attempt to prepare the way for a sequel.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses...definitely one of the better bands of the 80's. I mean how many bands went this far with their music back in that decade? Slash, Axl, Izzy, Duff, and Steve all worked their asses off when they created this, and I dont think it could've gotten much better. From the opening riff to 'Welcome to the Jungle' to the closing lines \\"all I wanted is for you to know that I care\\" in 'Rocket Queen' this album holds strong throughout. If anybody thinks that this is hairband then I've got news for you, they were far, far, FAR from a hairband. A perfect example of a hairmetal act would be Bon Jovi (Blowme), as they never took pride in their work, relied solely on image,  and only cared about money, they were the Good Charlotte of the 80's. Guns N' Roses (especially Slash) loved to make music, I think that should be obvious for anyone. This album revived hard rock at a time when the genre had hit rock bottom thanks to bands like Poison, and if there is any other album from the 80's that everyone should have, this is it with the addition of Metallicas '...And Justice for All'. Axl Roses voice may have been high, but it fit the band and it was definitely unique at the time. Slash was the main man along with Dave Mustaine in the guitar world from '87 - '93, keep in mind that Eddie Van Halen kinda lost his edge by this time thanks to Hagar (damn you Sammy). Izzy had a great rhythem section to match Slash's brilliant solos and single note melodies. Duff McKagens basslines were great to provide a stable backbone for G N' R. Steve Adler has to be the most underrated drummer of all time, he had fast and POUNDING drum rhythems, he actually sounded like a very creative version of Lars Ulrich. Right, the best songs here are 'Welcome to The Jungle' (obviously), 'Its So Easy', 'Paradise City', 'My Michelle', and 'Sweet Child O' Mine' (again, obviously). If you like hard rock, rock in general, or just music than you MUST have this, it is an essential album for the ages.
B00068NVI4|4.0|This is a very good Yes concert DVD.  What keeps it from getting five stars has more to do with the setlist selection than the actual performance.  Basically, the inclusion of \\"Mind Drive\\" slows down the entire show ... and considering it it played in the first half of the show, its inclusion kinda makes it feel like this show never really gets started.  After \\"Mind Drive\\" (which inexplicably is divided in different sections rather than played once through) is over, the show gets MUCH better.   <br /> <br />This DVD captures excellent performances of \\"Ritual,\\" \\"Turn of the Century,\\" and \\"Starship Trooper.\\"  And although \\"Mind Drive\\" was a bad choice, the inclusion of rarely played songs such as \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" \\"Going for the One,\\" \\"The Meeting,\\" \\"Time is Time,\\" and \\"Every Little Thing\\" is a real treat.  Anderson seems to be having a blast towards the end of the show.   The acoustic section in the middle is also enjoyable. <br /> <br />There are no extra features of note here, but the concert itself is very well-filmed.  White's drumming is hard to hear at times -- but that is usually the case in concert too!  Not the best Yes DVD (that would be _Symphonic Live_ or _Live from the House of Blues_) -- but definitely should be something a long time fan adds to his or her collection.
0060751967|3.0|Who would have ever thought of a vampire needing a dentist??  And a virgin vamp?!  That's probably the most original premises yet! <br /> <br />Roman is the typical rich, bored vamp you usually see in romances.  But once he falls in love with the girl, he becomes desperate and mushy and looses some of that proud aloofness I think a vampire should have. <br /> <br />Shanna wasn't really a likeable character for me.  I couldn't see anything that would make anyone fall in love with her. <br /> <br />Way too much time was spent on the Russian vampires.  I realize that they had to be explored to set up a series, but more time should have been spent on the main characters.  And Shanna's dad showing up really didn't fit at all.  He must be there to set up a sequel, too. <br /> <br />This book is definietly worth reading, but probably not a keeper.
B000AA305M|1.0|Just in case it helps, the UK-edition of this album is not copy protected; it's on a 'real' CD!
B00005BKZJ|3.0|I usually like off center, quirky, far side movies.  So I really liked this one even though you never get to know why Marianne's male companion dumps her in the desert.  CCH Pounder was terrific I wonder why she didn't make any more movies?  Though I question her character's wisdom about opening a diner in the desert.  But, it made for an entertaining movie anyway.  Enjoy!
B000A2GIK4|4.0|This is a good CD, I wouldn't rate it Excellent, but it has made it's way to my IPOD.  I loved the movie!
B000AL730O|5.0|I've purchased every single Paul McCartney solo effort, and although all contain at least a few songs on par with his best, most are simply not consistent and are brought down by filler tracks.      Certainly, Paul has been on a roll ever since Flaming Pie, so it's no great suprise that this work is a continuation of that streak.  What is a suprise however, is exactly how great Chaos really is...it's better than anything he has released since Ram.  This is certainly one of his finest records and quite possibly his best ever.      As others have said, and was the case with me as well, this record is benefits from multiple listens.  The first few times I listened to it I liked it, but after several more listens....wow!...it really clicked and I began to realize that this was something very special.  I'm listening to it constantly now...can't get it out of my head.  An extraordinary effort!  One of the best records of the year.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|Although it is extremely predictable, it is a nice light movie.  I would recommend it to preteen girls, to emphasis how important it is to be a strong independent women.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Before reading this review, be aware that I am not only fanatical about sci-fi, I am also extremelly devoted to the world of star trek and have enjoyed all the different shows its spun off into.<br /><br />  I have also been a great fan of enterprise, I believe they put together a great crew for the show, characters that are not only great actors, but work really well with each other, and within their roles.<br /><br />  Having followed the first two seasons with mild fervor, i felt that towards the end of the second season, i came off wishing for somenthing more, episodes, though original in their stories, most memorably the season 2 episode \\"Cogenitor\\" comes to mind as a great moment in the series, I left myself yearning for somenthing more,where the story was going, it never felt that the stakes were high enough, within the world of enterprise. All that changed with the last episode of season 2, launching season 3 into a crusade like story that would begin a DEEP SPACE NINE: Dominion war style story.<br /><br />  Cue season 3 of enterprise, and in my opinion the best thing to happen to sci-fi in recent times, the story of the Xindi, and their war of extermination on planet earth engulfed the entire 24 episodes of the thirds season, while the presence of the xindi objective is milder in some episodes, and critical in others, the pacing of interlinking all the eps, to tell a major story worked so well for me that I found myself stuck to the tv, and working my schedule around every week to wath the next episodes. In the days of television series that don't like to risk doing anything else apart from one stand alone episodes, season 3 of enterprise homages the pacing of SCI-FI legend BABYLON 5, and in doing so, tells a much more thorough and epic story, a SAGA if you will<br /><br />  I was first in line to buy this dvd set, the great extras go a long way too, but I cant wait to sit and watch all the episodes again, as back to back as possible. I recomend this season vey highly for any fan of sci-fi.fan of sci-fi.
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces is a gripping account of the 6 weeks James Frey spent in a treatment center in Minnesota for his addiction to alcohol and other drugs.  The abuse of drugs can really ruin the body.  There is a very descriptive part in the book where Frey describes the painful experience he endured having several root canals done without anethesia to repair his damaged teeth.  The abuse of drugs can also damage the relationship a person has with their family.  One of the more moving parts of this book is where Frey confronts his parents in counseling to tell them about his drug use and drug dealing.<br /><br />They are heartbroken to hear about all the bad things their son has done, and they become closer as a result of his confession. This is a bit predictable, but it is still really moving to read.  I also think that Frey is very brutally honest as he describes a constant craving for alcohol and drugs while in rehab.<br /><br />Every patient at the treatment center has a job to perform, and I really reading how Frey's jobs changed while he was there.  He cleaned toilets in the beginning, and then he switched to making coffee.  He finally became a greeter in his last days.  Frey spends a lot of time describes the friendships he made while in the treatment center.  Having other people around him who were struggling with the same addictions  helped James get better.  I thought it was interesting that one of the patients and one of James' friends at the rehab center was a judge.  I really enjoyed reading about his friendship with a crime boss named Leonard who kept him in the program.  James Frey's romantic relationship with a woman  named Lilly who suffered from sexual and drug abuse was very sweet.<br /><br />I think the message of A Million Little Pieces is that a person can overcome their addiction to alcohol and drugs if they have  people who can support them, and if they are willing and determined enough.  I enjoyed reading this book very much.
0060730552|5.0|This is a true story of a mountain expedition in the Andes where two British partners take risks acceptable to experienced and fit climbers. But here they draw a spectacularly bad hand - first with Joe having a terrible bone crunching accident that leaves him scarcely able to move, and then with rapidly deteriorating weather. Partner Simon attempts the impossible and begins an inventive, courageous one-man rescue operation, but half way down the mountain he is forced to make a ghastly choice: stay roped to Joe and both will perish, or cut the rope and make a desperate bid to reach the bottom.<br /><br />Simon chooses the latter, and the result is horrifying: with Joe plunging into a deep crevasse with no way of climbing up the sheer ice.<br /><br />But of course this memoir is written by Joe so we know that somehow, against all odds, our author will also get himself to safety. How he does so, and how he skirts around the very edges of death provides the book with its extremely powerful human resonance.<br /><br />I read this after seeing the excellent movie, and Joe's reflections, at the end of this book about the experience of helping make the film and reliving the horror (he and Simon are played by actors in wide shot, but the climbers provided all the close-up technical shots)- provides additional and unexpected depth and humanity.<br /><br />There's another reviewer below who was bored by this book. They must have been having a really bad day because Joe's writing takes you right into the heart of his ordeal. This is a stunning story. Five stars aren't enough.
B00026WU4G|4.0|I agree that Infidels is an often overlooked piece in the Dylan catalog. It has a great vibe to it and his lyrics, as usual, shine. From Jokerman to Don't Fall Apart..., he touches on- and in some cases  dives into- love, loss, politics, power, hubris, good and evil. His music never seems forced and the musicians jamming with him keep it all humming along. (It's no surpsie that the Neighborhood Bully sounds like a Stones riff  since I believe that's Mick Taylor helping out on that one.) And to the previous reviewer, I disagree that this song is about evil American power and expansionism-I think the lyrics are talking directly about Israel. All in all, Infidels is a great latter-day effort from Bob that was only eclipsed by Time Out of Mind 14 years later
6305949980|5.0|I am way too old for Disney kid movies, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is just an amazing movie! There is a lot of singing, sure, but wether you're an adult or child, you'll love this creative movie. However, I don't suggest this movie for young kids, simply because some of the images are too frightening for young children.
B000002HH9|5.0|This CD is probably my favorite as far as a full disc goes by the Cure. A lot of people descibe this as \\"weak\\", but as I see it Smith was progressing his sound and trying new things. I caught on to the Cure around Wish and was never a big fan of the older 80s material. I like songs more like Just like Heaven as opposed to Let's Go to Bed or A Forest. Basically, I like the more upbeat songs. I was amazed by the diversity on this release and it's still one of the top twenty cds I leave next to the player (out of the 600 or so that I own). I think that music is a progession and accusing a band of not sounding like their \\"older\\" selves minimizes thier art. Are you the same person you were 10 years ago? Embrace it! This is one great disc with no weak songs. The lyrics on this one are worth it alone!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! At The Disco is certainly an unusual, but likable, band. I'd suggest it to the alternitive and punk crowds.
1573223026|5.0|One of the many things I enjoy about Nick Hornby's books is his ability to take people I probably would either not like or notice and turn them into intriguing characters. I mean I've probably passed a number of Rob Fleming's of HIGH FIDELITY fame in various book and music stores in my lifetime, but apart from a short conversation I know nothing about them. In the hands of Nick Hornby, the Rob Flemings of the world become sympathetic characters we can all relate to because we either are Rob Fleming or we known a Rob Fleming. For the Will Lightman's of the world, introduced in ABOUT A BOY, I usually think \\"get a job and a life like everyone else\\" but when a writer like Nick Hornby finds a Will Lightman, he becomes a lovable bloke instead of a pathetic loser and we find ourselves rooting for him. Hornby uses these same skills but in a different manner in his latest work LONG WAY DOWN.<br /><br />In this novel, we meet four people who are atop a building on New Year's Eve, ready to end it all. We meet Martin, a former television star who has been jailed for sex with an underage girl; Maureen, a mother of a severely disabled child; Jess, a lost young woman who is the daughter of a political leader; and JJ, and American expatriate and wannabee rock star. None of them actually take the leap and a rather odd community develops between the four. While at times it seem somewhat implausible, and in the hands of a less skilled writer would probably be nothing but outlandish, somehow the novel seems to work and we find ourselves believing in the small world of these four people.<br /><br />The book is told from a first person point of view with all four characters having separate chapters. Hornby does a good job at creating distinct voices for the characters so we're never confused as to who is doing the narrating. He moves the book along rather well too. One character begins telling the story, then another picks it up. We don't get too many repeats of action or the four characters telling the same event. It's almost as if all four characters are in separate rooms. We walk in one room and one is speaking, then we leave and go to another and pick up the story again. The same holds true for room three and four.<br /><br />My guess is that LONG WAY DOWN will become a film. I would think it could make a good movie, but like HIGH FIDELITY and ABOUT A BOY, it could loose a bit of its edge. As a book we stay with each character and I'm not sure how that could be recreated on film, so read the book just in case it becomes a film.aracters telling the same event.

0671027387|3.0|In no doubt this was an excellent book, but I read it at a time when I was probably too young to read something so adult and advanced. The plot was excellent and I loved the smarts, but this book did drag on a a few parts and I had to force myself to read so I could see what happened after the cliffhanger.<br /><br />After reading all of Brown's books, this is about in the middle of his best work. One thing I did notice, is that a lot of his plots involve the same deception, and that is simply why I didn't like this one - it was the last I read of his books with the same similar plot.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie was finally done the way I've been waiting for a superhero adaptation to be done, not afraid to veer slightly away from comic book mannerisms in order to adapt the film to reality a bit. Kids would, at first, wonder: Is this really Batman? Daddy, did we go to the wrong movie? Haha, this is actually a good thing, because the depth that builds within the character- BEFORE he dons the outfit/costume, has to be seen to be believed. He doesn't pull his ability of hand-to-hand combat out of thin air. He doesn't glide through the night just because he can, and he doesn't dress like a bat because he loves bats. No, he actually hates them with a passion. The mightiest moment of the movie to me is when he flicks away a taser like it's nothing. The moment isn't spoiled by the fact that it isn't a super-power, but rather it's enhanced because it shows how prepared Bruce Wayne is to now take on the Gotham underworld. Just a powerful movie! It is one of my favorites. As a youngster I loved the earlier versions for their glamour and action, and as an adult I love the newer movie for its inspiration and powerful story...
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Even though this was only released yesterday, I've had this CD for awhile now, and it's amazing. Some of their songs are a bit messy, but that's what makes them good. PANIC! at the disco is extremely addicting, I've loved them for months and months. I just saw them live last night, and let me tell you- they were definitely, as Pete Wentz put it, the MVP of the night. I'd say that myself though, anyway. <br />But definitely get this CD. No doubts are necessary. PANIC! is techno/rock, even though their demos are a bit more technoy (gotta love the synthesizers). And definitely, if you have a chance, see them live.
0743454537|3.0|If you are looking for a book that will lead to heated discussions about moral and ethical decisions, this is a good book to read for a bookclub.  Each character is allowed the chance to be the 'voice' for a chapter, which allows for a deeper connection to be made with each character, instead of receiving only one character's opinion.  I read this book in one day, and cried at the ending.  Another reader said that the ending ruined her opinion of Picoult and that she wouldn't read another Picoult book ever.  To readers who love happy endings and 'happy ever after', read this book anyway.  It was nice to read a book that ended with life and reality in mind, in stead of pleasing the reader.  I have chosen to give this book 3 stars (even though I really enjoyed it) because I have read better (and worse) books.  Picoult is a good writer, and I plan on picking up some more of her works at the library today.
B0000029GA|5.0|this is an amazing album every song is perfectly put together lyrically and the rapping is a master class this a giant of an album in my eyes the greatest album eva released, the best songs are: <br />it ain't hard 2 tell(greatest song eva made) <br />memory lane <br />the world is yours <br />lifes a bitch <br />NY state of mind
B00000DGUY|3.0|Editing Money for Nothing is terrible, that's why Brothers in <br />Arms is ranked a good CD. Don't go with this, go with other <br />Dire Straits albums that are way better.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The film production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" certainly plants itself in one's mind.  Webber, Mackintosh, and Schumacher have created a beautiful, rich, and sensual production that has brilliantly translated the stage musical to film.  The caste, both major and minor, are superb.  That attention to detail in costume, set, and casting that makes even the minor characters interesting and appealing gives depth to the film.  Gerard Butler as the phantom is inspiring in his gruff voice and the only phantom that I have seen or heard, other than Colm Wilkinson, that makes the part believable and passionate.  By the end of this story about a classic love triangle of innocent love and obsessive love, one understands and sympathizes with Butler's phantom.  Emmy Rossum has a such a versatile voice from deep and sexy to operatic for one so young.  Patrick Wilson, with a lovely voice, plays the typical romantic.  Simon Callow and the others provide needed comic relief.  But it is Minnie Driver, who for me, is perhaps the most memorable character of them all, and one of the best songs is \\"Learn to be Lonely\\" that she sings at the end. <br />   I had previously purchased a one-disc edition that had just the movie.  When I read that the 2-disc version had the \\"making of the stage musical and movie\\" sections and another song that did not make it into the movie--although it should have--, I ordered it and have watched it constantly ever since:  a set well worth having in one's collection.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I love this CD, It is their first CD and one of their best behind <br />Making Movies and On Every Street. The original album contains <br />hits such as Down to the Waterline, Sultans of Swing, and Lions. <br />If you don't see this in stores and if you only see Brothers in <br />Arms, don't pick it up because it is not ranked their best. <br />
0743243153|2.0|I give it two stars for the few interesting ideas presented.If you are in a emotional trouble, this hodge-podge book could make you feel worse-I know I did!Since this book was published, many good self-help/spititual growth books have been published.Do not waste your time with this book which is basically a pile of pseudo-metaphysical drivel.
B00004Y6NT|2.0|This album is just the same as Brothers in Arms, very week. <br />But Brothers in Arms is ranked better because it has atleast <br />4 of 5 songs that rock. This album only has 2 good songs, <br />Lady Writer is the best song on this thing.
B0006399FS|4.0|I wonder if those giving this less than 4 stars are simply comparing it to previous and more 'popular' U2 albums (like Achtung and Joshua).  Do not compare this, as the 'apples to oranges' metaphor applies here.  No doubt a worthy title release, and easily one of the best of 2004.  I prefer the 'Rare and Unreleased' versions of each song than that found on the official release (Adam Clayton has even remarked that the 'best' version of certain songs may not have been chosen for the retail release).<br /><br />Rarely does a 25-year-old band release material of this quality, and considering most of their fanbase today were alive even when they called themselves The Hype or Feedback, taking serious any score less than '4' from certain reviewers is difficult.<br /><br />HTDAAB confirms that U2 are still 100% relevant today.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This one rocks dude!!! Every song is amazing on this album, <br />ranked way better than Brothers in Arms and great sound too. <br />All of these songs are 5 star especially epics like Telegraph <br />Road and It Never Rains. Industiral Disease makes me laugh <br />great. This one is ranked number 1 behind Making Movies. <br />
B000067J1H|5.0|The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of those films in the past few years that deserves to be seen several times. Norton was nominated for best actor. What was cool was when a guy shot himself in the mouth Brad Pit died.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is probably the greatest by Dire Straits. It is amazing, <br />Heavy Fuel ranks the top Dire Straits song of all time, and is <br />definately a big hit behind Money for Nothing and Sultans of <br />Swing and Skateaway. I love The Bug too, and it is another great <br />big hit. This album rocks, after Brothers in Arms. <br /> <br />Buy this along with Making Movies and you <br />own the best 2 from Dire Straits. <br />
B00005JKMQ|5.0|Will Smith is completely wonderful as Ali, he gives a performance to remember, along with Jamie Foxx for Ray, and Tom Hanks in Forest Gump, the others are also great, another good performance from Jamie Foxx, of course Jon Voight is great. I do have to say that it does have plenty of cliches, mostly in the screenplay, there usually about trying not to be to forth-write with some of the things Malcolm X, and Ali, said or did.
B00004Y6NP|3.0|How come everyone thinks this is the best Dire Straits album <br />yet? It's not the best. The songs are slow,  <br />like there are only a few songs that rock, plus one or two or <br />3 weeak songs. I am a huge Dire Straits fan plus this album is <br />not ranked their best. Money for Nothing I think maybe the best <br />song off the album beacuse it is a big big big hit. So Far Away, <br />Walk of Life, & One World also rock. If you want the best Dire <br />Straits albums, skip this and go with On Every Street, Dire <br />Straits debut, Love over Gold, and the even better Making Movies. <br />
B0007GAERG|1.0|Okay so there is one great song on this album but honestly there is a lot of hype over the entire album. It honestly sounds as if it was produced very fast and just given great PR to promote it. I can not deny that she has a great voice however the fact of the matter is that the production of the songs for the most part are very boring. She was great during her first and second albums. Im sorry I purchased this based on the hype. :(
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I'll say this is probably the best Dire Straits CD ranked behind <br />On Every Street. Because of Heavy Fuel. All the songs are big <br />hits like Heavy Fuel. The best songs give me love like Tunnel <br />of Love, Skateaway, & Expresso Love. I also love Solid Rock <br />too. My least favorites off this probably are Romeo & Juliet, <br />and Hand in Hand. But I like them both. All these songs are <br />great, and Les Boys is not a bad closer for the album. <br />
B000003C5C|4.0|Death were never the fastest metal band, nor were they the most brutal, but the incredible music that they made was head and shoulders above the other death metal bands at the time for one special reason: their music had heart. i first heard Death on the At Death's Door compilation; and their song (\\"Open Casket\\") stood out so strongly among all the other featured bands on that collection. their was a unique sense of conviction in Death that is so simple: songs first, speed second. sure these tunes are fast...but it's never one million blast beats a minute just for the sake of being fast and furious. the tunes speak for themselves and are the testament of the killer songwriting of Chuck Schuldiner. his craft for melding memorable thrashy riffs combined with his mid-range throaty growl (which always reminded me a bit of Obituary's singer) is truly second to none. and no one can write a review of Death without mentioning the fantastic solo ability of Chuck. his grasp of melodic phrasing within these frames of brutal intensity is worthy of much praise. you could almost say that it's one of the biggest assets of Death's metal...something that further sets them as the band to believe in and the band to inspire greatness!
B000002MJR|5.0|This is the best CD EVER MADE!! My favorites are Walk of Life, <br />Heavy Fuel, & Romeo and Juliet. The only thing very great about <br />both Heavy Fuel & Romeo and Juliet is they make you bang your <br />head so hard. If you want rock and roll, you have to get this <br />CD. I hope this review was helpful to you.
B000003C2S|4.0|i love the way this album starts off with the full throttle blast of \\"Living Monstrosity\\" it has a great solid brutal approach from the get go. this is Death's third studio album (and first with the awesome James Murphy on second guitar). on \\"Spiritual Healing\\", Death haven't crossed over into those more progressive realms just quite yet. they are experimenting a little bit here and there, but the core of this music is still basic thrashy death metal with killer hooks and exquisite soloing. some of the lyrical content is a bit under-developed and a bit idealistic in it's scope of answers to social issues. you may find yourself pausing mid-headbang and thinking \\"did he just say that?\\" but it must have been a breath of fresh air in an age where almost every death metal band was growling about the joys of satanic devotion.<br /><br />overall, a great addition to any old school death metal fan's music collection.
0060512806|5.0|Don't let the massive size stop you, this is one of the great books out there.  Stephenson has a great writing style and mixes real history characters with his own as well as Forrest Gump did.  The book zips along and, once you get used to it, the jumping back and forth between time periods and characters, keeps it from bogging down.  Give it a read, you won't be disappointed.
B00015YVD6|5.0|When I first saw this movie I was a impressionable kid. When I got home I had a--baffling to my parents--need to take a bath where I began the tests to see if I too was a mermaid.  I could smile underwater. I could hold my breath for a long time, and I had really long hair.  But as long as I stayed in the water...no fins.  Well this was obviously because I was not in sea water.  It was good that we were going to visit my grandparents in Florida soon.      Well vacation time came, and we were obliged to take the mandatory day at the beach trip.  I was nervous about my new underwater life to come.  I vowed not to shed tears when I told my family that I was leaving them to find my mermaid family under the sea.  My after transformation goodbye speech was prepared and I was going to be sure to tell them that it was awfully kind of them to watch me for my mermaid family but that it was time for me to go home.  I gave them a hug and headed for the water.      The transformation didn't occur right away so I waded deeper and deeper.  I waited and waited.  Kept myself deep underwater, held my breath (I tried to breathe but choked) for as long as possible.  Still nothing.  Then it occured that I was wearing a swim suit and that was impeding my transformation.  So off it went.      Hence the most embarrasing moment of my life.  Being caught naked at an emotionally fragile time.      Oh well, just see this movie, you won't regret it.  It doesn't age.  I miss John Candy.  The twin towers also get a few picture frames.  It was nice to see them again.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Some of the other reviewers here have done a good job of describing the film, so I'll just add: <br /> <br />1. WAAAAY too much screen time was given over to the pretentious,  self-important windbag Allen Ginsberg, who, it should not be forgotten, was a member of and celebrity spokesman for the North American Man-Boy Love Association. My skin crawled every time that twisted, depraved creep appeared on camera. So it crawled quite often. <br /> <br />2. Most of the incredible, rare and first-rate (in sound and picture) concert footage was chopped off way too early. I had no idea Dylan sounded so strong and focused at Newport in '65. Show us the whole performance. <br /> <br />3. To be fair, it should have been pointed out that the electric performances would have sounded nowhere near as good to the audiences of the time as they do in the film. Dylan admits the sound systems were \\"archaic.\\" We hear those performances remixed now and can discern every word and every guitar lead and every organ note. The concertgoer in '65 and '66 heard a distorted, booming, cacaphonous mess. How much different would their responses have been if they'd been able to hear the music properly?
B000B5XZLU|5.0|A Jamiroquai fan since the get-go, this album is seriously solid from top to bottom.  Every album thus far has had at least 1-2 throwaway-skipover tracks, except A Funk Odyssey which contained many throwaways.  Dynamite seems to suffer from this condition less and maybe not at all. <br /> <br />Through the first week of listens, the title track Dynamite has been played over and over in my brain along with Seven Days In Sunny June, Starchild, and Talullah.  Those were my favorite four tracks to start. <br /> <br />With more listens this week, Black Devil Car has emerged and risen as well as Hot Tequila Brown, Feels Like It Should and Electric Mistress.  The others not mentioned are all still solid really. <br /> <br />And I will whole-heartedly disagree with Mistermaxx on his 1 star review here and calling out the fact Jamiroquai has been getting by without \\"writing a song.\\"  You could maybe say that on Funk Odyssey, but this one is a whole different flavor.  The lyrics are much better and the grooves are back to what older fans have come to expect.  There is some dynamite material in here.  Well worth the time and money spent.
0060977493|5.0|My sister had been telling me to read this book for a long time and I just never got around to it. I wanted to, but I have to admit that the subject matter seemed pretty standard for an award-winning book: 'The God of Small Things' centers around a tragedy that rends a family apart and its lasting effects on the twins who were at the heart of it. But the truth is that there is little that is standard about Arundhati Roy's writing. She tells her story in a completely original narrative that puts you inside the heads of the young twins who drive the plot. You see the world through the slightly fantastic, exaggerated eyes of a child caught in very grown-up circumstances. I can see that some would criticize her style as \\"weird\\", but that is the whole beauty of it. Most children that I know see the world in a slightly off-kilter way (and I know for a fact that I did). That's just the nature of kids. The innocence of the perspective makes the events of the plot seem that much more disturbing and downright chilling. I was wrong to expect a by-the-numbers book when I picked this up. Ms. Roy's novel is very original and well written. Now if only she would write another fiction book!
B00000IQC8|5.0|Not the first of the Jay and Silent Bob movies, not the best either. In my opinion they are all the best. I have seen them all, seen the animated Clerks as well. I laugh hysterically each and every time I watch this movie. A fellow reviewer stated to remember the number 36. When I read his review I screamed out the line that pertains to. My neighbors know I am cracked. If you like stupid humor, slapstick comedy, a shot in the dark then this film is for you. Snoogans.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Bob Dylan is the real deal, and this documentary is fascinating.  I watched the program on PBS and will definitely purchase the DVD.  When Dylan said, \\"You don't need my autograph - if you needed it, I'd give it to you,\\" I wanted to hug my TV.  I'm living in a time which allows a talentless media slob like Paris Hilton and her ilk to flourish - it's a pleasure to see a real talent, a real artist, a real treasure given the time and attention he truly deserves.  Thank you, Martin Scorcese.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I absolutely adore this DVD!  Then again, I should admit that I am very passionate about my favorite band...  Steve Augeri, the frontman of the current line-up puts on a great show.  He is an excellent performer and watching this DVD reminds me of the great times I've had at their concerts.  Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory, and Deen Castronovo (with Steve, of course) play some of their greatest hits from the 70's and 80's and a couple from their album, Arrival...  I am hoping that they will record a live DVD for their 30th anniversary tour but until then I will continue to watch this DVD until it \\"wears out\\" (then I will buy a new one).  :)
B0006Q1ULQ|5.0|I've recently started reading Umberto Eco's Baudolino, a rambunctious tale of a thirteenth century opportunist. \\"The world condemns liars who do nothing but lie, even about the most trivial things, and it rewards poets, who lie only about the greatest things.\\"<br /><br />Although I'm only 120 pages into this 500 page novel, I'm engrossed by the weaving plots and rich characters. Baudolino is an Italian peasant with a gift for languages and a bald-faced liar who is adopted by an emperor as a boy and falls in love with the emperor's young bride as a teenager. He studies at the University of Paris in its first years, and befriends a wannabe poet and a moorish scholar, and the three of them are off now on worldly quests, befuddled by alcohol and \\"green honey\\".<br /><br />The thirteenth century was an influential time for so many elements of our modern society, seeing the usurpation of the church in Europe by the birth of the university, science, nationalism and capitalism, for all the good and bad that it all heralded. This book thus far does a great job of chronicling this from the perspective of someone entrenched in the middle of it all. It's great fun to compare our modern knowledge with that of a medieval persona.<br /><br />I'll let you know what I think when I'm done with it, but so far, I'd highly recommend Umberto Eco's Baudolino.
B000A0GXGA|4.0|\\"Maverick\\" was one of the best (and highly entertaining)  westerns to hit the TV airwaves during the late 1950s.  The three episodes represented here were among the best; \\"Pappy\\" with Troy Donahue and a pre-\\"Batman\\" Adam West was standout. <br /> <br />The folks at Warner Bros. did the right thing to showcase each episode exactly as it was originally broadcast, even down to the brief opening scene and fanfare (replete with the WB shield) that opened each '50s era show (deleted when TV Land aired the series a few years ago). My only disappointment is that there are no bonus features. <br /> <br />I know that there are some die-hard purists out there among classic TV fans, and I join them in hoping that Warners will release full-season sets of this and other early hits in the near future!!
B000AA305M|5.0|i'm just trying to balance out all the junior high brats giving this album one star due to its lack of ipod accessibility.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The more I listen, the more I've come to believe \\"Greendale\\" is one of Neil's true masterpieces. At first, it seems like just another Crazy Horse album with the volume, distortion and anger turned way down. But, like a Steinbeck novel, its brilliance grows on you. For a Crazy Horse collaboration, there is an intimacy to these songs that I find thrilling. Without question their best work since \\"Ragged Glory\\". The feeling is one of sitting on a beat-up couch in a garage some lazy summer evening while Neil and the boys jam and tell you the story of small town dreams, both dashed and realized. \\"Carmichael\\" and \\"Grandpa's Interview\\" are nearly perfect both musically and lyrically; the beauty lies in a masterful balance of Ralph and Billy's propulsive rhythms and Neil's barely-restrained fuzzed guitar and seemingly stream-of-consciousness singing. The rest of the album is just as satisfying, especially the way-too-cool-for-words rockabilly anthem \\"Double EE\\" and the opening track \\"Falling from Above,\\" which so wonderfully sets the stage for the hour+ journey.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I loved the 2-disc special edition of the Phantom of the Opera with Gerard Butler as the phantom.  I've watched the film several times and can't get enough of the romance!  Gerard Butler's portrayal of the phantom is so passionate.  He conveys so much pain and anguish in his love for Christine. There is so much emotion in his voice when he sings.  I cry everytime I watch the ending.  This is a bittersweet love story. I can't get enough of it.  Also, the special features disc has the deleted scene of Gerard singing \\"No One Would Listen\\" which is so beautiful! Such a wonderful scene.  Gerard's voice is filled with so much emotion.   Great!

0385338686|4.0|The premise of this story is simple:  a young English lawyer has her fast-track career derailed in a spectacular way.  She stumbles into a new career and learns some hard but valuable lessons about life's tradeoffs.  Yes, it's true that some elements of the story are predictable, but readers of chick lit would be just a little disappointed if Mr. Right didn't turn up somewhere, right? And it does seem that our heroine's domestic IQ seems impossibly low for someone who graduated with honors from Cambridge.  But I found myself rooting for Samantha from the first page and sped through the book because I wanted to find out how she would manage to make lemonade from lemons.  This book is a fun, quick read that should appeal to fans of the Shopaholic series who appreciate SK's ability to create likable, quirky, and spunky heroines.

B000A3XYZA|5.0|Villegier presents Handels great opera Rodelinda in silent movie terms - characters are made up with white paint and lipstick; the costumes on the women are gorgeous 1920s and the acting is heavily stylized as in an old Gloria Swanson film. And it works!!! the stylized movements and emoting exactly fit Handels very stylized and formal composing. To top it off the singing is superb. Andreas Scholl in his operatic debut is astounding - \\"Dove Sei\\" is heart rendingly beautiful, the bravura arias are superb and the acting is heartfelt. As a matter of fact all of the singers are thoroughly in the Handel idiom and William Christie leads his great Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in a very dramatic performance. One of the best operatic DVDs I have ever seen.
B00005YUPO|5.0|I am so happy with all of the Baby Einstein DVD's. Especially Baby Bach. My son is 6 months old and he has been watching Baby Einstein since he was a newborn! It's genius! He sits there and watches all of it! Now that he is 6 months and watched them so much, he has memorized when the end is. He will start fussing right before the credits come up! He just loves Baby Einstein and so do I. It gives me enough time to make bottles or just get off my feet. I will always buy Baby Einstein! I think they should never stop making them! They are GREAT!!!
B0000714B5|4.0|This is a beautiful film in many ways, probably none more so than in the way the director has interpreted Herman Hesse's novel of the same name. I see little point in regurgitating the essence of the plot as it really does nothing but detract from the purpose of the review.<br /><br />As with all works of art, in whatever media form it may be expressed, this is an interpretive statement of the author's original novel and as such it is an interpretation as much based on the audience it is geared up to as well as the film maker's. It may be legitimate for a critic to dispute the finer points of the interpretation or even  the philosophical or religious underpinnings but in this case, it seems to me that we miss the point.<br /><br />As a reader, I must confess to finding all of Hesse's work not as it would appear at first glance. Even Siddhartha, an apparently simple tale, is a much more complex and thought provoking text than it appears. Not being an expert in this area, I do not dare to present an exegis of the book which I will happily leave to more authoritative reviewers.<br /><br />To me the director has tried to tease out, as he sees them, the salient points of the text and has done so in a personal form as if the main character is the narrator. He tells the tale in a rather unfeeling way suggesting a sense of detatchment and objectivity, a device which is present throughout the movie and which in a way denies the need to try and deal with an emotional aspect. Siddhartha's inability to deny his emotions is sorely tested when his newly found son rejects him and runs away to the town. Further, his innate inability to recognise these passions and deal with them brings into sharp focus the imbalance in his character of being too objective, too clever, too logical. In a way the film seems to be taking more of a Zen approach throughout.<br /><br />There is abundant beauty throughtout this film. Not surprisingly the three central characters are very photogenic and beautiful and their surroundings are clear and beautiful too. The exposure of poverty and opulence to the camera gives everything an appearance of beauty including the poor and the holy men. This again allows the highlighting of the bad as feelings and inhumanity such as the travellers pushing away the young boy as he searches urgently for help for his mother.<br /><br />There is beauty too in the overall serenity of the movie which perhaps may have been an aim of the director.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie can be interpreted too on many levels and in that it certainly follows the book. I found it to be engrossing and thought provoking and my only negative is the excessive echo on the voices.<br /><br />This is a must for anyone who wishes to take an introduction into Hesse's work before delving into the text. It is worth watching too as a sumptuous spectacle of filmmaking.and beautiful and their surroundings are clear and beautiful too.

B00005JODA|5.0|Magnificent adaptation to the John Le Carre book of the same name is a quite a cinematic feat in style, mood and acting. Rachel Weisz creates one of the most profound movie heroines in modern film with a performance that is strong, moving and determine.  She's an acting powerhouse in this film and her performance carries the tone of the film to near perfection. Ralph Fiennes is just as great as a man haunted by his own inactions. He was not really there for his wife and he just shut himself out of the world untill tragedy strikes and he has to not only defend his late wife's honor but also be aware of the horrors that are in the world he lives in. Fiennes carries this role to perfection and he's just as good as Weisz in his role as well.    Fernando Meirelles gives this tale of tragedy, and redemption a breathtaking sense of realism and his take of the African nation is profound and beautiful with its great landscapes and heartbreaking poverty. He does not pull a punch in his directional style and in that, he proves himself among the great directors we have working today.     A+
B000A78Z82|3.0|Some musicians get better with time. Some do not.  I cannot say for certain which category Devendra Banhart falls into.  However, I can say that his new album, \\"Cripple Crow,\\" released on September 15th, is disappointingly not at all like his past work. <br /> Sure, his voice still quivers and soars over a wide-range of notes, but this time the listener's relationship with him is different.  Before, sighs and imperfect execution made listeners feel as though they were Banhart's private audience for an impromptu concert put on for friends.  This time, the songs are perfected and sound professionally mixed.  There are no characteristic whispers of, \\"1, 2, 3, 4,\\" before each song.  We are no longer Devendra Banhart's close friends, but paid listeners of an impersonal and distant musician.   <br /> Banhart's recording attitude is not the only thing different in \\"Cripple Crow.\\"  This album trades his former casual, gypsy-influenced folk style with a folk style diluted with classic rock and Mexican folk music.  Indeed, it seems that every other song trades off sounding like a cheap cover of Bob Dylan or a Mexican serenade.  This album also breaks away from Banhart's former solo acoustic style with the addition of other artists and instruments.  It is mainly the collaborative aspect of this album that causes the loss of intimacy and Devendra Banhart-charm. <br /> The track, \\"I Feel Just Like a Child,\\" is so strongly reminiscent of Bob Dylan that it could really lose Banhart's original audience.  The better of the 22 songs on this album, namely \\"Heard Somebody Say,\\" \\"Inaniel,\\" \\"Hey Mama Wolf,\\" and a few others, suggest something of the old Banhart charm but are still obviously heavily `studioized.'  We are no longer out in the woods with Banhart-we are listening to a cold, hard disk in our rooms.   <br /> Contributing to the lack of the former outdoors-feel is the strange mix of lyric subjects.  On Banhart's earlier albums, the lyrics were most often concerned with insects,animals, and the outdoors; but on \\"Cripple Crow,\\" despite the misleading title, the songs range in subject matter from The Beatles to marrying little boys.  <br /> Still, it must be said that \\"Cripple Crow\\" has some redeeming qualities.  Banhart's intricate guitar work is still present and the introductions of new instruments (piano, horns, bass, and drums) are decent additions to a few songs.  There are also times when the background singers add a memorably catchy element to the songs, and the seven songs in Spanish are also interesting and worth listening to.    <br /> Of the 22 songs, I would consider 12 to be decent.  Original Devendra Banhart fans might be disappointed in the album as a whole, but these 12 tracks make \\"Cripple Crow\\" an important addition to a Devendra Banhart collection. \\"Cripple Crow\\" is certainly more accessible than Banhart's past albums to music listeners not accustomed to, or not fond of, his old style.  This album would also particularly appeal to those whose music collections consist of artists like Bob Dylan and Phish.
B00006LI4S|5.0|If you like Pink Floyd even a little you must watch this DVD.  Every song is lovingly arranged and performed.  I got goosebumps at least three different times. It is in 5.1 surround and in 16:9 ratio perfect for widescreen tv's and home theater enthusiasts.  Buy it now and enjoy!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This summer was a great one for music with a large number of tours, the first ever Intonation Festival with two days of mostly excellent music, and the release of Sufjan Stevens' \\"Come On Feel the Illinoise\\" album.   <br /> In the Sufjan Stevens' tradition, layered and complex instrumentation and melodies are mixed with simplistic ones to create varying moods throughout \\"Come On Feel the Illinoise.\\"  And, as always, Stevens mixes mature lyrics with whimsical, humorous prose.  Despite continuing his classic style, Stevens does not fail to produce an entirely unique album.   <br />Dedicated to the state of Illinois, the album is the second installment in his plan to produce an album for each of the fifty United States.  This album includes songs written about Illinois' history, famous people, cities, small towns, and even a serial killer.  Most of the 22 songs on the album are titled with long and ridiculous names, such as \\"The Black Hawk War, Or, How To Demolish An Entire Civilization And Still Feel Good About Yourself In The Morning, Or, We Apologize For The Inconvenience But You're Going To Have To Leave Now, Or...\\" and \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From The Dead!! Ahhhh!\\"  It is these eccentric songs coupled with somber songs such as \\"John Wayne Gacey Jr.\\" that make \\"Come On Feel the Illinoise\\" such a unique representation of the complexity of human emotions. <br />In contrast to the long title names, the songs vary in length from 19 seconds to almost seven minutes.  Some of the songs run into one anther and some are continuations of the previous tracks, clearly indicating that the album is meant to be listened to as a whole.  The album begins with an eclectic mix of banjos, vocal harmonies, piano, guitar, and drums, all of which are used on and off through the rest of the tracks.  The beginning tracks are upbeat and almost childish in attitude, however complex the musicianship is.  <br />Though a few of the tracks are writtenin the same key and they may sound very similar to a listener unaccustomed to Stevens' style, a closer listen reveals new ideas and complicated riffs that greatly contribute to the album as a whole.   <br />Soon the upbeat and carefree mood changes, however, and the album takes on a more serious tone.  \\"John Wayne Gacey Jr.\\" is an emotional song, recounting the horrors of Gacey's crime while showing him as a real man. Intensely respectful, Stevens' relates his own secrets and discretions to Gacey's in the lines \\"in my best behavior, I am just like him, look beneath the floorboards, for the secrets I have hid...\\"  <br />The rest of the album cycles between moods and ideas, each complimenting the other by providing contrast and complexity.  The album truly works best when listened to in order.   Never failing to implement elements of folk, jazz, and cinematic musical genres in a intricate layering of instrumentation and vocals, Sufjan Stevens produces an album that is a worthwhile addition to any collection.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This movie is great & Bob is special. No doubt. So here's my problem. The movie wants me to believe that lots of people turned on Dylan just because he went electric. But if so, Bob was writing for an audience of total imbiciles - and what does that make him? No mention here of the new lyrics which were a little dark. And then we all had a big psychic crash, which hasn't ended yet. Blame Bob?
B0000042H4|5.0|On LP these recordings were appealingly airy, but with incredible impact, placement of singers, and sonic bloom. On the original Decca CD masterings, they turned wiry and harsh. This was a shocking thing to do to the greatest Ring cycle, whatever one might say about Solti's high-voltage, take no prisoners conducting.<br /><br />Now the error has been corrected to a great degree. The latest remastering is much more listenable, less harsh and wiry. But we still have a ways to go. Perhaps in the future some new digital technology will bring back the beautiful sonics of the original Lps.
B000002552|5.0|If you want to know Dylan, this is the place to dwell.<br /><br />Forget the fight about folkie versus blues rocker,born again or orthodox Jew,opportunist or purist...it makes no difference when this music sinks in.<br /><br />When Dylan and the Band got together and created this music it changed musical history.<br /><br />Books are written on these recordings impact, bootlegers command 100 dollars for the complete set.<br /><br />This is serious stuff indeed..there is nothing to say except the remaining songs must find expression in a legit box release given the treatment like the new Band box which looks very impressive.
B000001XO3|4.0|I bought this live 1953 Ring cycle almost as soon as it came out, lured by the notable Clemens Krauss and a lineup of famous Wagnerian singers. The Amazon reviewer is right to call them stalwarts--there are flashes of brilliance in quite a few of the protrayals vocally--and the sound is good broadcast  mono for the period. Windgassen is seriously overparted as Siegfried, but he was the best anyone could do for a very long time after Melchor's retirement. Overall, this set gives a fair portrait of Bayreuth at its best using post-war singers.<br /><br />For all its virtues and incredibly cheap price, for me the real problem was in the orchestra.  I found Krauss sloppy too much of the time, and hiss tendency toward relaxed, lyrical phrasing bothered me when I wanted dramatic thrust. One doesn't expect perfection in live performances, of course, but I could not find many long stretch of conducting that equalled the greats and near-greats who have given us music from the Ring: Furtwangler, Karajan, Levine, Solti, Szell, Klemperer, etc. However, in his way Krauss does better than the brusque, rushed Karl Bohm in his live Ring cycle from Bayreuth twelve years later (on Philips). As Live cycles go, I found that I enjoyed neither this one nor the Bohm quite enough to call them great. I will stick with studio versions.<br /><br />P.S. March 2010 -- Looking back, I was too blase about Krauss's ring. Now that we have it in better sound from other labels -- particular in the total overhaul done by Andrew Rose of Pristine audio -- the vocal merits stand out, even if the orchestra's contribution still seems too sloppy and, thanks to backward placement, sonically muted.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I own all nine seasons and going to buy this one since my DVD's are getting old, now does this DVD include the DVD boxes indivually like you would buy them nw or all togeather
B000001G53|5.0|Some disappointed reviewers have piled on to this recording, but I feel that it is unsurpassed among modern performances on disc. Karajan had conducted a live Parsifal from the Vienna State Opera (on BMG) that has the incomparable Hans Hotter as Gurnemanz and Christa Ludwig singing Kundry in Act 2 magnificently (strangely, Karajan asked for two Kundrys, each given her own act).<br /><br />Despite those advantages in Vienna, Karajan grew musically with this opera and here gives a performance of astounding depth and virtuosity. The orchestral playing is miles ahead of that achieved in the pit by Knappertsbusch in his various live performances from Bayreuth, and the digital sound, though not perfect, is very good for the Eighties.<br /><br />Kurt Moll sings with authority as Gurnemanz, besides his rolling deep bass, there is a feeling of enormous sorrow mixed with spiritual gravitas. Only Hotter exceeds him on CD. For many listeners the Kundry of Dunja Vejkovic will be too Slavic--at loud volume the voice turns shrill and squawky--but dramatically she is fierce with anguish when needed. Don't expect eroticism in Act 2, however.<br /><br />Which brings us to Peter Hofmann as Parsifal. This is not a long role vocally, and by no means does he spoil the set. His career was a flash in the pan, and his Tristan for Bernstein is a disaster despite the fact that his Siegmund for Boulez in the famous Chereau production had been a triumph. Here he is in as good form as he ever achieved. To his credit Hofmann is intense and dramatically believable, but the role puts vocal strains on him, and it shows. I have seen raves at Amazon for Wagner singing that is equally strained, but I can't paper over the fact that Hofmann is underpowered in the final Grail scene, a considerable drawback.<br /><br />In the end, Karajan's conducting is the element that sweeps this Parsifal to the heights. His vision is so musical, virtuosic, and passionate that I cannot understand any rating but the highest.est.
6301744160|3.0|On one hand, this movie is absolutely incredible.  The special effects, suspense, and adventuristic elements are very well done and very engaging.  In general, it's definitely entertaining and fun to sit back and just allow to take you along, like the ship in the bloodstream.  It also throws random thoughts about religion and philosophy out in a way that should at least be appreciated for trying to cater to an intellectual audience, I suppose...<br /><br />On the other hand, it has terrible dialog, pretty bad acting, one-dimensional characters, is so caught up in the Cold War, and fails to make those philosophical shout-outs mean anything.<br /><br />Thus, while we're thrown from one aspect of pretty well researched anatomy to another, it can take your breath away two ways: by dazzling with visuals, and by derisive laughter at the total inanity of the writing.  It's just too silly to take seriously, and yet it doesn't seem to have been created to be comedic but awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Modern day audiences, as well, will get a good hearty chuckle at the little Intelligent Design situation.  Good to know we haven't gotten any further, really, in our intelligence than when we were scared to death of Russian saboteurs.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000A0GP4K|4.0|This film follows Dylan up until 1966, and it is not THE story of Bob Dylan, so much as A story of Bob Dylan. Those familiar with the history might get a little antsy in places, and at first I was a little frustrated that we find ourselves focusing on the young Dylan most people have in their heads already, instead of the older Dylan who seems the more interesting subject, if only because he's been less exposed. The film tells, in a way, why Dylan probably didn't want to touch on that, why he changed and retreated from view, and the last half-hour approaches the subjective jitteriness of the last section of GOODFELLAS. While not a groundbreaking masterpiece, it is still full of delights -- for instance, I can't get the image of Dylan and a drunk Johnny Cash warbling a slowed-down version of \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" out of my head.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|The Queens have been on the end of a vicious beating by the precocious media stick as of late. With Nick leaving many people began to doubt their musical output. <br />Well i must say this is not \\"Songs for Deaf 2\\"and it would be plain boring if it was. The hard edge that Nick brought to the queens fold has calmed to a degree, but in its place is a sort of psychadelic experimentation,that is equally tastey and makes for an interesting listen.(songs like \\"Someones in the Wolf\\" with the bubbley vocals and complex riff) <br />I saw them live recently and the new songs fit in perfect with the classics. <br />Even though i doubt they can top Songs for the Deaf this is an album that doesnt try to match it, it steps to the left side and shows you something new and fresh. Which in these days is rare for a rock band.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|This film is one of the best of the year. <br /> <br />I had a hard time telling which one I like better the original or the new one.  The new one is awesome great new efects.  Movie is great if you read the book as well.  There is more story and more detail of what happened relates better tot he book then the original.  Movie does have Tim Burton's classic dark look. <br /> <br />The oompa Loompas are great this time around again with great music just like the original one of the best parts was the oompa loompas.   <br /> <br />Tim Burton defintely did a wonderful job and pays great tribute to the book I loved being able to see more of what happened aftet the glass elevator where the originl ended and throughout the movie there was more.  So we could call thsi the extended version of Willy Wonka with a much better look and feel to the movie so defintely worth a rental at your local Blockbuster or Hollywood Video if your a renter and not a buyer.  Movie is defintely worth a purchase to me especially for 15.99
B00000AFGM|5.0|Yep, i aint no typical manson fan,quite frankly his previous album does nothing for me.But this album is great.The guitars are bursting at the seams with creative leads and a glam rock undercurrent. Twiggy the bassist handles most of the lead and rythym guitars,and should be acknowledged for such a creative effort on this album.His songs like 'Rock Is Dead' and my favourite 'Dope Show' are quite simply hard rocking and hip shaking something they havent had on previous albums which have been more of a derivative metal influence. <br />This album goes to show dont believe the critics they arent always right.
B00004RYZT|5.0|This is a great DVD that is very entertaining and without a dull moment. I don't like to watch concert footage because they are boring and the music usually doesn't sound as good but this is Rammstein and they know how to put on a show. They are playing to a soldout stadium in Berlin. The audience is consevative looking and the age group is mixed which is interesting to see because Rammstein is an industrial metal band. If this was in America the audience would be smaller and they would all be young and wouldn't understand what they were saying. The band members are in costume and have silver stuff in their hair which you don't see too much from rock bands who usually go on in a t-shirt and a pair of jeans. The pyrothectics rage from sparks coming out of boots, drum sticks, a bow and arrow also microphone stands and the singer are on fire and the singer shooting a flamethrower over the audience. It also has some humor to it like when the very skinny keyboardist tries to dance and the singer thrusting his hips and when he wheels himself around  during the song Heirate Mich. Sometimes the keyboards are little bit louder than the guitars but I didn't  mind it because it gave it a different sound. The song Wilder Wein is much better here than the studio version because it isn't as long and the accoustic guitars and violin give it a nice touch. There is also an interview at the end with subtitles for those who don't know german.  Now for the things that weren't that good. They show the same clips of the audience members over and over, some of the parts are slowed for a second and when the singer slams a microphone stand on stage they show it from different angles. The reason I didn't like all that was because it took away from the live feeling but it's easily ignorable. I find myself watching this DVD all the time and it never seems to get old and watching this DVD will either make you a fan or a bigger fan of Rammstein like me.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's not very often I get to listen to a \\"perfect\\" album, an album which has a thematic core to it, with strong lyrics, well-played music which varies from slow to fast, and songs which just reach out and grab you, while others just soothe.<br /><br />I've been listening to Coldplay's X+Y this past week. The British rock group has produced a collection of great tunes. It's got the feel of rock, and pop, and it's a little space-y, which I haven't heard in a while in popular music, so it all feels fresh. The lyrics are complex, and evocative. Some of the tracks especially reached out and grabbed me: \\"Square One\\", the opener, which introduces the space-y feel in both the music and in the lyrics; \\"What If?\\", a song written by a worried quiet romantic; \\"Fix You\\", a track that starts small, builds to a crescendo, and speaks to me of things going through my own mind right now; and \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\", a quieter song which is very lyrical.<br /><br />What can I say? To me, it's a perfect album.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|When i read that the sessions took place in nashville, i was a little disappointed. Though i know that neil is probably too old to write \\"Ragged Glory 2\\" or even \\"Tonight's the night 2\\", i never liked Harvest and Harvest Moon as other people did. Harvest was a masterpiece and i like it but i prefer many other albums from the man. I'm not against being mellow or country, i just didn't liked the \\"sound\\" of it... Also, i didn't like much of the late songwriting he did. I was expecting a Harvest Moon, or worse, a Silver and Gold, which are \\"sufficient\\" albums for my tastes. I'm surprised tough: i don't \\"fully like\\" the sound of it as i expected, but that doesn't keep me from saying that this is a very good album. If you like the Harvest serie, you'll probably like it as much as Harvest and much more than Harvest Moon. I mean it, a WONDERFUL end to the trilogy. The sound is clear, his voice is in good shape, he seems to be having fun and the songs are good. No weak spots on this one. I gave it 4 stars because of my personal tastes, but you really should listen to this one to see if it catches yours.
B00008H2LB|1.0|This music is good for the first few listenings, but it gets incredibly old and the talent isn't all there. I'll admit that Mike Shinoda is a good rapper for the fact that hes well... not really rapping. Chester cant scream better than a 4 year old school girl. If you want real music with screaming, listen to some Killswitch Engage, Alive or Just Breathing?. Great album! Yeah i'm done bashing these guys haha
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Goodness! That was my reaction after first hearing this album. Mixing synth punk and dancecore Panic! at the Disco reminds one of a miraculous combination between Fall Out Boy and Motion City Soundtrack. \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" will never leave your CD player.

044651652X|1.0|After having heard a lot of the women I know just gushing excitement over this book a few years back, I finally decided to read it.  Boy was I disappointed.  This book is nothing more than a run of the mill romance novel with a yuppy cover.  The character development is shallow and the story is boring.  I found it difficult to finish and am glad I got it from the library instead of spending good money on it.  So, unless romance novels are your thing, I'd advise you to look for another book to spend your hard earned money on.

B00025ETIW|5.0|good cd but the first oneis so much better. i like the solos on here more. too many people know them now but that happenes to All great bands. favorite songs are you know what the do to guys like us in prison, thank you for the venom, i never told you what i do for a living, and i like the solo for ghost of you. i gave it 5 stars instead of 4 cuz too many people on here are giving it a 1 and never listining to it
B000002UAX|3.0|Yes, I am editing my White Album review YET AGAIN. Why? For two reasons: I have no life, and I recently listened to the entire album again. As a result, my opinion on several songs have changed. This is probably the reason why not the Beatles, but the Rolling Stones, are my favorite band. Had The White Album been cut down to one disc as George Martin wanted, the Beatles would probably be my favorite band and the White Album would've probably been their best.<br />I love doing the song-by-song rating thing, so here we go...<br />Back in the USSR: 10/10. Funnier than anything Weird Al Yankovich (AKA Ultimate Novelty #1) ever parodied, the Beatles take jabs at the Beach Boys, Ray Charles and Chuck Berry. Very good way to open the album up.<br />Dear Prudence: 7.5/10. High on most fan's lists, I like it but don't love it. It is an interesting, trippy/folksy tune though.<br />Glass Onion: 9/10. I don't see why so many people hate this song. It's funny and has a nice arrangement. Not a big statement along the lines of A Day in the Life or While My Guitar Gently Weeps (also on this album), but I still like it!<br />Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da: 10/10. One of the better moments, and a minor hit single. The ska-influenced song is good fun like other songs here, but the sessions for the song itself caused a lot of tension between John and Paul. In fact, that famous intro (with the slamming of the piano) was a sign of John's frustration.<br />Wild Honey Pie: 1/10. AACK! This is the kind of song we'd expect to show up on bootlegs, not an official release. Arguably the worst song on a Beatle album.<br />The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill: 1/10. This one's a contender for that title too, though. I don't see what so many other fans see in it... it's just annoying and has that stupid chorus...<br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps: 10/10. The second-best song on this album, composed by George Harrison and featuring Eric Clapton on guitar. Probably George's best composition with the Beatles.<br />Happiness Is a Warm Gun: 10/10. Best song on the album. In it's three minutes or so, it goes through five different movements, the most famous being the screwed-up doowap parody part. Very good!<br />Martha My Dear: 7.5/10. A bit overdone in arrangement perhaps, but great piano.<br />I'm So Tired: 7.5/10. A throwaway, but in a good sense of the word. The Beatles still had a sense of humor, and this song is proof.<br />Blackbird: 8/10. Not a kid's song as some think, but a pro-Civil Rights Movement anthem. I like it!<br />Piggies: 7.5/10. One of the stranger songs in the Beatles catalouge, and one of Harrison's many social commentaries. Along with several other songs on this album, it was sadly misinterperated by the insane Charles Manson.<br />Rocky Raccoon: 10/10. The best damn Western murder ballad around, plain and simple.<br />Don't Pass Me By: 2/10. Another example of how bad this album  could get sometimes. And there are several. Trust me.<br />Why Don't We Do It In the Road: 7/10. One big innuendo. It's utterly stupid, but lots of fun. Led Zeppelin would later make a career singing songs only slightly more complicated lyricially than this. (I think \\"Why don't we do it in the bed\\" would be a good title for most of Zep's songs, but that's off-topic).<br />I Will: 4.5/10. A bore.<br />Julia: 7/10. Good, but so soft you can barely hear it. I don't mind quieter songs, but I prefer to actually hear the songs I'm listening to - a major problem with Julia.<br />Birthday: 10/10. Another one of the Beatles greatest songs, and probably the most famous on this album - you hear it at every baseball game when they read off people's birthdays, and it's often played on the radio in the same way. For some reason, it's been left off all Beatles compilations. Shame on them!!<br />Yer Blues: 10/10. A blooze parody exaggerated so badly that it's hilarious, and has some great blues guitar from the boys. It's interesting that two genres of music (emo and death-metal) were bornfrom the line \\"Yes I'm loney/I wanna die\\". And I don't mean that in a good way.<br />Mother Nature's Son: 5.5/10. Another one of the more boring moments on the album.<br />Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except For Me And My Monkey: 10/10. How can you NOT love this song? Whenever I hear it, I jump up and down like an idiot, screaming. It's great!!!!!! And the title's hilarious!<br />Sexy Sadie: 8/10. The song about Mahareshi Mayatomi (or something like that) Yogi's alledged... well, because it's a family website, let's just say \\"unwanted relations\\" with Mia Farrow on the Beatles' disastirous retreat to India, and it's got nice piano. Originally titled \\"F$^% a Duck\\".<br />Helter Skelter: 10/10. The world's first metal song is right here! Listen closely and you can hear out-of-tune tenor sax and trumpet, played by Lennon and Mal Evans, respectively (neither of them could play either instrument). Total, head-banging chaos, ending with that famous \\"I'VE GOT BLISTERS ON MY FINGERS!\\" scream. Sadly misinterperated by Charles Manson. Now where's the legendary, still unreleased 27-minute outtake?<br />Long Long Long: 5.5/10. Other than the ending it's not really much. Led Zeppelin would later borrow the idea of using a flute on Stairway to Heaven.<br />Revolution 1: 10/10. Underrated, and ripe for rediscovery. I perfer the original of course, but there's nothing wrong with this one!<br />Honey Pie: 2.5/10. Another crappy attempt at '20's jazz by a pop group. Paul may \\"like this kind of music\\", but coming from the Beatles, I don't.<br />Savoy Truffle: 10/10. Ridiculous, stupid, irresistable, and one of the underrated White Album songs.<br />Cry Baby Cry: 5/10. Don't think much of it.<br />Revolution 9: WTF?/10. Whoa, John and Yoko really got away with murder here. Eight minutes of chaos, disorder, mayhem, disarray...yeah. Not a song, but it is a pain to the ears. I swear never to listen to it again.<br />Good Night: 1/10. John said he wanted it \\"Really cheesy\\" and he got it. Sadly, the song itself's a bore.<br />It's a mediocre double-album that coulda been a great single-album, but wasn't. That's what stardom (and drugs) do to you, I guess. (having experienced neither I can't tell for sure).  Thankfully, they would bull it all together for Abbey Road, the Best Album of All Time, then sadly split.<br />Recommended Beatles Albums:<br />Abbey Road<br />Revolver<br />Rubber Soul<br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<br />A Hard Day's Night<br />Let It Bey.  Mother Nature's Son: 5.5/10. Another one of the more boring moments on the album.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|The problem with viewing a documentary about Dylan is that there is a wealth of material that has been released over the years and they fear is that there will be nothing new.  That was the main complaint about the A&E \\"Biography\\" released a couple of years ago.  It was superficial and not worth the effort.  Sort of like a thumbnail sketch of a great artist.  \\"No Direction Home\\" by Martin Scorcese is a landmark event in portraying the most important artist of our time.  Not only does the film confine itself to a specific 5-6 year period (1961-1966) in Dylan's life, the great one actually participates in the production.  The key question that Scorcese seems to ask over and over is:  how did Dylan go from Woody Guthrie to completely transforming American music in 5 short years.  Most artists struggle their whole lives within a certain genre and are never able to break through to the essence of the form in which they toil.  Dylan is the Shakespeare of our time, and this film makes it abundantly clear that the artistic process was filled with traps, lies, backstabbing, etc.  Scorcese incorporates never before seen and heard recordings, film, interviews, rememberances, and comments by the master himself.  My first viewing of this film yeilded some interesting results.  Dylan is a very funny guy.  He can tell a joke with just his eyes and to watch him spar with reporters and other \\"Mr. Jones'\\" is tremendously entertaining.  No wonder this guy didn't care much for the press.  Dylan also offers a few gems during his interview.  My favorite is \\"You can't be wise and in love at the same time\\".  Upon a second viewing, you definately get the sense that Dylan put up with a whole lot more than most people would have just to practice his art.  Dylan looked weary on the 1966 tour, burned out, despartely tyring to maintain his sanity, while he is \\"just trying to get home\\".  The added material on the DVD don't really add a whole lot to the presentation but some of the extra's are fun.  The film is genius.  It certainly validates Dylan when he decided to only work with the best throughout the years.  Scorcese really catures the times, the artist, the madness, and the crash.  I absolutely loved it and plan on viewing it whole for the third time within a week of its release. <br />

0786715103|4.0|General Romeo Dallaire's \\"Shake Hands with the Devil\\" is an eye-opening book for anyone not familiar with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.  This book is General Dallaire's personal memoir of his year in Rwanda in command of UNAMIR - the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda.  Despite General Dallaire's and his soldiers' bests efforts, almost a million Rwandans were brutally massacred in the midst of a civil war. <br /> <br />General Dallaire, a francophone Canadian, spent a long and distinguished career in the Canadian Army before being selected to lead UNAMIR.  Reading the guest foreword and then Dallaire's introduction, I expected this book to be full of vitriol and uncontrolled emotions.  Countless times in the beginning I read about General Dallaire's post-traumatic stress disorder.  Fortunately, General Dallaire didn't let his emotions overpower his writing, and his narrative of the year is level and even-handed, even when describing shocking events.  <br /> <br />General Dallaire describes his planning for the mission, his interactions with the UN, and his struggle to understand the political realities of Rwanda as he tries to implement the Arusha Peace Agreement.  When he meets some of the leaders who will soon lead the genocide, he didn't know at that time that he was \\"shaking hands with the devil.\\"  Soon, General Dallaire's tiny UNAMIR tried in vain to at least slow the wanton killings as Rwanda descended in to civil war.  He personally knew most of the major personalities on both sides of the conflict and in the international community, and his personal meetings and communications with these people serve as good personal snapshots of these people. <br /> <br />One thing that struck me was the sheer futility of the mission as General Dallaire's UN forces were extremely short on supplies and manpower - and the UN was unwilling to supply more of either.  At times during the book I admired Dallaire for still trying to stop some of the killing, and at timesI lamented the futility of the mission as Dallaire described another horrific scene of carnage and killing.  Few people would have had the strength to continue to fight for more resources from the UN when it was clear that there was no political will in the world community to support UNAMIR.  After reading this book, I realize that the entire UN concept of these operations - going in with a mix of poorly-equipped troops, no guarantee of logistical support, a UN bureaucracy that prevented even the simplest things to be handled (Dallaire and his staff once had to pay their own landing fee at an airport), and a complete lack of decisive force - is flawed. <br /> <br />There are still a few criticisms of the book.  One is that Dallaire's conclusions are not supported by the rest of his story.  He primarily blames the French and Americans for his problems in Rwanda and gives the UN bureaucracy a pass.  His story vividly describes how the French contributed to the problems in Rwanda, but, other than some second-hand comments about Security Council wranglings, he didn't describe how the Americans bore much of  the blame for the failure of his mission.  (That is not to say that America was blameless in our actions and inactions in Rwanda, when we easily could have stopped the killings.)  He also doesn't resolve the story very well.  After reading a detailed account of one traumatic year in his life, I wanted to know more about the personal and professional problems that he openly admitted to in his introduction.  I also wanted to know more about what happened in Rwanda and to the Rwandan genocidaires.  And finally, in his conclusion, Dallaire links the poverty of the Third World to the 9-11 hijackers, despite the fact that most of the 9-11 hijackers were educated and affluent, not poor and starving African refugees.  <br /> <br />Two other minor complaints: the binding of the paperback is not strong enough to hold together a 600-page book and began to split, and the formatof the glossary made it difficult to use. <br /> <br />Despite these minor flaws, this is a great book and should be read by anyone to get a better understanding of what happened in this forgotten country in the 1990s.  General Dallaire should be commended for working to save these people and for finally telling his story years later.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Let me first say that I HATE Neil Young's music. Neil leaving CSN&Y was the worst career move that I can think of. I think that his voice sounds like a naked man sitting on a block of ice in a snow storm. Wavery, Shaky, and just plain weird. I think that his hard rocking stuff and lead guitar playing are terrible. He gets the WORST sound out of his Les Paul- worse than anyone I've ever heard (note to Neil- QUIT using the Bigsby Tremelo on your solos!). <br /> <br />Having gotten that off my chest, I happened to listen to this album on Neil's web site before I purchased it for a family member as a gift. He loves Neil... <br /> <br />I was totally surprised. This is a really, really GOOD album. The songs seem heartfelt and more than just 'cranky' as Neil sometimes hits me. Acoustic, Bluesy, Countrified, and (for the most part) well-crafted lyrics make this a great, moody album. Neil reflects on life, family, politics a bit too. It's a lot more stripped down than most of the stuff I've heard from Neil. The absence of his electric guitar playing are worth the price of admission. I happened to read Neil's interview in Time magazine regarding his family, mortality, and music and was very surprised that the guy I was reading about was Neil Young. He's got a lot more depth than just being a cranky old rocker dude. My mistake. The song for his kids is really touching. <br />This album is a good one. Buy it.
0880796863|2.0|I have just received these cards and am dissatisfied with the colouring on them. When I compare them to a similar pack I have, which is made by another company, all the colours are poor, i.e. not vibrant. In particularly the `blues' (water, sky etc.) appear a dull pastel green. Also, the outlines in the pictures are thicker, giving the appearance of less detail.
0393035158|4.0|Many graduate students reach a point in their education when they realize that they know a lot of things, and they want to share those things with a lot of people.  The result is usually a long, rambling doctoral dissertation, but sometimes it takes the form of something extraordinary, as in the case of Albert Einstein. <br /> <br />Sam Harris is no Einstein, but he is a graduate student with a lot on his mind.  His books tackles the issue of religious faith, as it relates to politics, science, history, and philosophy.  Now, no one is an expert on all these subjects, and one can sense at times that the author is rambling and/or speculating about things he doesn't understand too well.  A few examples are a passing suggestion that ESP should be studied more thoroughly (this has been done many times; no such thing as ESP), a fairly dopey pro-torture argument that would make W's lawyers proud, and a very long discussion of mysticism towards the end of the book. <br /> <br />That said, the writing style is very engaging, and the sheer exuberance with which Harris presents his central thesis makes the book a worthy purchase.  His argument in a nutshell is that faith is a type of human weakness that has historically brought out the worst in people, from The Inquisition to modern terrorism.  It also brings out positive aspects of human nature, but these can be and generally are accessible to reason and rational discourse, with no religious mythologizing necessary.  Harris is right on both counts, and if there's anyone left on Earth who's still on the fence about this issue they should pick up a copy of his book immediately.
B000A0GP4K|1.0|I was so disappointed with this documentary. Why does it only go through the late 60s?  Dylan has THIRTY more years of his career, which is ENTIRELY ignored in the film. Martin Scorsese made this? What? Oh how the mighty have fallen. To me, the most interesting part of Dylan's career was when he turned his back on all the folk music/hippy nonsense and got real, real weird - but you won't see any of this in this clunker. Avoid.
1400049628|3.0|I had great hope with this book. I mean, just take a look at the cover and title. On top of that, what a great idea for a book on a cool subject. But after getting through the first half of the book, it just started getting grueling (not in a good way) to read. It just got boring and dragged on. Pretty much this is not a book you read in a couple of settings. You pretty much just thumb through chapters (order of the chapters doesn't matter) when you have the time. In other words, this isn't your typical reading book and more of a how-to / reference book.<br /><br />But worth getting, in that there are definitely some cool and interesting parts. It also makes you wonder about real life zombie attacks (which is always cool) and how to start stockpiling weapons and rations. Brooks also has some funny one-liners in the book. And for you horror buffs, it makes you want to re-watch your zombie movies (or see new ones) which is always good. 3.5 skulls
0553212621|5.0|I read Lady Chatterly's lover for the first time in high school, and to be honest, it was more for the juicy bits than anything else. Five years later, though, it was an aside from a professor during a  lecture on Nabokov that convinced me to pick it up again.<br /><br />This was the first novel that I'd read where I truly felt an inner conflict brewing - but in a good way. Lady Chatterly's Lover, though banned for its immorality on its publication, is a book that will force a person to question their own morality and moral judgements, and perhaps rethink them.<br /><br />It is a story of a young woman married to an older man who is confined to a wheel chair due to a war wound. Her husband and she have a respectful relationship, though she does not love him, and though he may love her, he is not particularly attentive. To cure her boredom and satisfy her libido, she turns to adultery. Her first lover is a egotistical Irish writer, but she leaves him quickly over \\"performance\\" issues. She finds herself attracted to Oliver, the gamekeeper on her husband's estate. They continue the affair under the nose of her husband, who, afraid that she will leave him, pretends not to notice.<br /><br />Lawrence's writing is sublime, to say the least. His descriptions  of the estate are picture perfect, and each scene is told almost cinematically. The characters are perfectly developed; you can feel Lady Chatterly's inner turmoil in the beginning of the novel as she copes with caring for her husband and her unsatisfied libido, without any social outlets but her husband's friends. As she begins her affair with Oliver, you notice how that tension that she held is slowly released - and how her husband, paralyzed and coping with a wife who spends less and less time with him, absorbs this tension. Beautiful read.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I admit, I'll never be a major Phantom \\"fangirl.\\" However, I can understand the appeal of this deeply melodramatic, gothic musical. I'd seen the musical on stage years ago, and while I thought it was very good, it did not inspire a life-long fandom in me. However, the film offers something a stage production cannot--a more close, intimate, and lush experience. So it's no surprise that the movie adaptation had a greater impact on me than the stage musical.<br /><br />I came into this movie with an open mind about casting and other details. I didn't have a firm, rigid idea of who would (or would not) be good as the Phantom. I'd never seen Michael Crawford play the part, only the younger, more attractive Davis Gaines. So, I had no trouble with Gerard Butler as the Phantom. His voice is not perfect, but he sings with great emotion and gusto. It seemed to me that he made the most of his limited vocal skills, and so I found his singing surprisingly good--in a raw, uneven sort of way. Butler is also strikingly handsome in this film, which is funny, because in the few other films I've seen him in, he was more average-looking. I think he's one of these \\"chameleon\\" type guys who can look drastically different in various roles. He sure makes a fabulous impression as the Phantom.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum is lovely, has an absolutely stunning (STUNNING) voice, and seems to possess the right amount of sweetness and innocence for the role of Christine. Patrick Wilson also has a gorgeous voice, (but I *hated* his hair). He does the best he can as the almost universally disliked Raoul. (Well, we don't *dislike* him, we just don't *like* him all that much. He's not nearly as interesting as the Phantom!) Minnie Driver is also great as a prima donna pain-in-the-neck diva. She always has outlandish constumes and is very funny.<br /><br />I enjoyed the music--the melodies are appealing and stick in your head, but after a while I started to think, \\"Didn't I hear this tune before?\\" Lots of recycling of material. It's not all *that* bad, and I liked the music enough to buy a few songs online, but when I compare it to some other famous musicals of the past, it does not measure up.<br /><br />The thing I most enjoyed about this movie are the visual elements--the photography, the costumes, the sets, (oh my, the elaborate sets!). The attention to detail was fantastic. A feast for the eyes. And yeah, the actors and actresses are all a feast for the eyes too--everyone's very attractive.<br /><br />The story is . . . let's not mince words . . . a trifle *thin*. I wished there was more character development, and I wish there was more backstory, more fleshing out of the Phantom's and Christine's prior (and very strange) mentor/protegee relationship. It's still an interesting tale, especially near the ending, when things really start to pick up.<br /><br />My advice to anyone who has never seen any variation of \\"Phantom\\" is to realize that it is *WAY* over-the-top with melodrama--is angst-ridden, gothic, terribly romantic. There's the dramatic swishing of flowing capes, single red roses dropped in the snow, swooning, and so forth. Which makes it a lot of fun to watch, as long as you are willing to be carried along with it.'s not all *that* bad, and I liked the music enough to buy a few songs online, but when I compare it to some other famous musicals of the past, it does not measure up.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|We enjoyed this series. We missed it on the TV, but a friend shared a couple of shows with us, and we enjoyed it. We are now looking forward to the movie when it is released. Worth the money, and a good additon to our DVD Libary.
0064400018|5.0|I admit I am at a loss for words to describe a book that meant so much to me when I was nine and got the boxed-set of all the Little House books for Christmas. I know I leaped into these books and loved every second of reading them. The setting of isolation in a vast northern woods where a family could live off the land in their little log cabin sent my imagination flaring. I read and re-read each chapter in the life story of Laura Ingalls and her sisters and parents, and bulldog Jack, as they lived in Wisconsin at a time when panthers and bears still roamed the wild forests. The most magical parts to this novel were the ones about Christmas and also about family gatherings. Even though people then had less in the way of material things than we do now, they seemed happier and richer in their joy at what they did possess. I think that's a secret to life that has been lost in our own time. Hopefully anyone who has ever wanted to read this novel has gotten the chance. It's that special, in my view.

B000002IRL|5.0|I love this cd so much I had it tattooed on my left arm. Thats the logo and not the actuall cd. This is not only the best line up Overkill ever had it was also the best sounding. Production God Terry Date once again proves why he is one of if not the best in the biz. Opening up with fast head pounding Coma, non stop driving drums and mind blowing guitars each song has as much aggression as the next. Blood money, Thanx for nothin, and bare bones don't stop. Not until we get to the self title song do we get a break from the lightning speed of this band. Again it takes off at the bands unbelievable cover of the Edgar Winter groups \\"Frankenstein\\". Live young die free then have a nice funeral all in one day? After one hell of an headbangin cd they end it all with \\"Soulitude\\". A chance to regain your energy to start it all over again!
B00000E0YH|5.0|Midnight must rank as one of the all time rock vocalists ever! As other reviewers have said listen to \\"Lost Reflection\\" and feel the shivers up your spine! <br />Crystal clear guitars rip through the songs at pace and the choruses are brilliant throughout,probably the only week song is Mayday.The original release of this album never had Dream Dancer,this was a 12 inch single E.P(remember them?). <br />Imagine these on Top of the Pops!!!
B000929AJQ|2.0|I'm a big NIN fan, I have all of their albums except this one. Since I listened to the single \\"The Hand that Feeds\\", I was surprised at how trendy it sounded; still I was hoping the album would offer something interesting. Sometimes musicians should be honest with themselves, after awhile you simply have nothing more to express, and this happens in any kind of art.
0060594888|5.0|I am always in the look out for self-help books and quite frankly, I wasn't interested in yet another success book. What a delightful shock to discover that Jack has taken the cream of the crop tools and delivered it with a refreshing approach that leaves me inspired, motivated and pumped! Suddenly, I am taking more positive action than ever.<br /><br />[...]
B000AARKOO|4.0|This movie suffered under the weight of Hollywood's awful box-office year.  That's too bad.  One of the greatest directors in history (Ridley Scott) does it yet again...in fact, I can't remember a bad film done by him.  <br /> <br />Liam Neeson is incredible, and most suprisingly of all, Scott makes pretty-boy Orlando Bloom very convincing as a warrior.  The story is fascinating and the fights are mind-blowing.   <br /> <br />All of that, plus throw in a cameo by Edward Norton, and you've got an overlooked classic. <br /> <br />FINAL VERDICT: <br />she's a BUY, lad.
0226039331|5.0|The lexicon is the best that I have used.  Very easy to read and to find the words that are being looked up.  Excellent information for each entry.
B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast is one of the greatest rap groups in hip hop history and they prove it in this album. Every track on this album is a must listen and thats hard to find even now on hip hop albums today. The combination of Andre and Big Boi go well and they are both so lyrical that even if the beats weren't on point they would still turn the song into a good track. I may be being bias because I am a huge fan of outkast but if you are a lover of hip hop then this is the album to listen to. Peace!
B000A0GP4K|3.0|I knew next to nothing about Dylan. But why is it that once again a talented artist revered by many has to turn out to be an awful human being? In fact, a comman thief. Stealing someone's record collection is the seventh deadly sin around these parts as far back as I can remember. Someone out there (you know who you are) still has my white vinyl copy of Bela Lugosi's Dead. But to steal someone's song without their permission to further your own career and wallet is a blindfold, cigarette and firing squad offence. It's still a fairly comman thing to happen to this day. The guy he pinched from was wryly avuncular about it in retrospect but I bet at heart it rankled. But what goes around, comes around and very appropriately the offender is called a Judas at the end of the documentary. Actually, the electric stuff sounded alright to me, although the playing of the last song was obviously despondently delivered. If I turned up to see something gentler and had my eardrums assaulted by discordant psychedelia maybe I would have been miffed too. But it sounded okay. <br /> <br />Dylan was different than I expected him to be. With those eyes and that drawl, he rather reminded me of Clint Eastwood. I felt the film was too hard on journalists. It's not easy to ask questions about music and some people at least tried to ask something thoughtful, even if it didn't come across that way. Unless it was a contractual obligation, Dylan was big enough by then not to have to do press conferences. <br /> <br />One thing Dylan did get right was in not inviting Joan Baez back on stage with him down the line. It was obvious by the cringe making footage that their two vocal styles were too at odds with each other to come together successfully. But some obsessive out there will probably do a five hour documentary proving just how wrong I am on that point. Wasn't that little girl who sung in the beatnik cafe great, though? Something Maulder. Looked a bit like Cher. <br /> <br />Was Like a Rolling Stone the most important song of all time? Well, it's certainly catchy and if it's catchy then who cares about the lyrics?
B0002858YS|5.0|All I can say is that since I got this CD it is the only hting I've been listening to.  I've recommended it to friends and they all say the same thing.  Great debut album... can't wait to hear what they do next.
B000A0GP4K|2.0|First off let me begin by saying two things: <br /> <br />1. I've been a rabid Bob Dylan fan for most of my life. <br />2. I've been an avid Scorcese fan for most of my life. <br /> <br />Too bad this documentary is a flop.  Mostly it's far too long, and covers more of the era and the other bands surrounding Bob Dylan at the time than the actual man himself.  The pace of the documentary is awful, and I could hardly believe the director's name when I read it. <br /> <br />The segements about Woodie Guthrie are interesting, and the concerts where Dylan was booed because he'd gone all \\"hippie\\" was a neat addition.   <br /> <br />Other than that, it gives most fans nothing that they really want to see...which is perhaps a more intimate look at the man behind the legend, not the era surrounding the legend.  And perhaps that is how Dylan and Scorcese wish to leave the legacy.   <br /> <br />A legend rather than a hardknock story. <br /> <br />If you want to watch a truly entertaining documentary check out \\"Don't Look Back\\".  That one is mentioned briefly in \\"No Direction...\\" and though it's only shot on one of his many tours, it serves as a more entertaining experience. <br /> <br />Also I recommend picking up \\"Chronicles by Bob Dylan\\".  It pretty much covers the same stuff as this documentary, but it's told by the man himself.  And despite all of his \\"experimenting\\", he's actually a pretty good writer.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|His weakest cd yet in my opinion, maybe he has just got tired over the years. Very slow & toned down, I hope he get's back to more blues type music, a little disappointing.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|No one has mentioned this about the film - it really struck me that Dylan's writing seemed to be truly inspired, almost in a spiritual way.  His long, wordy songs seemed to \\"channel the collective unconscious\\" as someone said - he seemed to be receiving messages from the people, or from the cosmos, or both.  The scenes of him singing at the Newcastle gig made him look transcendent (or high - but if he was, he still managed to nail the songs, and that is a lot to remember.)  I got the feeling that somehow these songs came through him in a way that was beyond his own control.  Sure he was a person who cared about his reputation, but don't overlook, minimize or misunderstand (as some reviewers here have) the brilliance of the songwriting - the poetry - which first changed and then became part of our culture.  The movie is incredibly interesting at a psychological and spiritual level.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I would be really curious to see the demographics of the people who like Porcupine Tree. Speaking for myself, I'm 54, a Vietnam Veteran and yes, I still remember the 60's fondly. Perhaps that is why I absolutely love this group! I didn't think it was possible for someone (Steven Wilson) who was too young to live the 60's to sit down, write, play and produce music of a quality that immediately transports you back to the days when we were literally overwhelmed with great artists, groups and songs. Like the previous album, \\"In Abstentia,\\" \\"Deadwing\\" caught me by the ears and propelled me headfirst into each and every song, building up a level of excitement and listening pleasure that was (and is) hard to believe. What else is hard to believe is that Porcupine Tree is not being played on radios everywhere. This fills me with mixed emotions, as I respect and enjoy the band and want to see them be successful, but I also don't want them to go too mainstream and lose their edge and the humor - Steve's lyrics still crack me up sometimes - you really have to listen to them carefully. If you feel compelled to buy a CD soon - do yourself a huge favor and get \\"Deadwing!\\"
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I really have nothing to say about this album since many of the reviewers have said what I want to say about this piece of brilliant work by Sigur Ros. What I want to say is why the record company kept blaming p2p and piracy for the reason of the drop-drown of their sales. First, I have to confess that I have a sneaked copy from the internet before the album's release date, but I have long decided that this is a must buy for me and I just want a preview of the whole album, so many of my friends did the same thing as well. I mean when the record company and the artist pull out a brilliant album like this one, I am sure there are infinite of people will pay their hard-earned cash, Sigur Ros surely deserved all the effort they put in it.     And I really want to know who are the ones who keep digging our money? the industry it is. Jesus Christ, look at the movie industry, how many freakin editions of T2 has been released so far? So as many of the movies nowadays when they come to DVD, they have a bare-boned edition first, then they come out with some director's cut, then ultimate edition and sth like that. Aren't the industry and the marketers are rather greedy and ashamed of their dirty tricks? How do you expect with those trend, they can keep the loyal customers around?     The music industry should really think about what leads to the drop-down of sales, don't always just blame on p2p, consider rubbish like Jesse McCartney, William Hung can get a massive exposure in the media, compare with those brilliant musicians like Sigur Ros, Godspeed, Explosions in the sky, Sufjan Stevens, Death Cab, Arcade Fire, Anthony and Johnsons.... and many good indie bands. People will buy things what they think it's worth the cash.
B000A0GP0Y|2.0|Somehow it feels forced.  As forced as all of these \\"Happy-Madison\\" productions.  I never bothered with the original adaption of this film, but it's probably better.   <br /> <br />I grow tired of Sandler playing the tough but nice guy.  I grow tired of Chris Rock's big-toothed grin and \\"crazy\\" exclamations.   <br /> <br />Same old prison jokes...so on and so forth.  <br /> <br />It DOES have a few funny scenes, though.  But nothing \\"laugh out loud\\".  If you're a football fan you may enjoy it, but I'm not gonna' guarantee it. <br /> <br />FINAL VERDICT: <br />RENT.  Once. <br />
B00005A8H5|5.0|This cd is definitely a must have. This is an album that every 80s music fan should have. Buy it today!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|People who have the ability to laugh at themselves and the sometimes absurdity of life in general will appreciate this story about a gawky misfit and his misfit friends.   I have a hard time buying the \\"only people looking down on Napoleon and his friends can find this movie funny\\" reviews.  Let's face it, beinig young and in high school stinks and no one, I mean NO ONE escapes the ridicule or embaressment of growing up, pimples and all. <br /> <br />The characters are likeable and they don't ask you to feel sorry for them.  Infact, while they have a unusual way of dealing with life's little challenges, they do, in the end \\"triumph.\\"
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The joy of this movie is the familiarity of the characters and their lives. I identified with Deb and her teenage insecurity, and remembered friends from school (and from more recent years) that were remarkably similar to characters in the movie. I got a kick out of Napoleon's treasure hunt in the thrift shop, and seeing the 80s and early 90s fashions that I so awkwardly wore to please my mother, long after they went out of fashion. Tetherball, Tater Tots, mixed tapes, and sibling rivalry rounded out the warm and fuzzy feeling.<br /><br />Note that this is not a movie for watching alone, but with friends who also grew up in the 80s and early 90s.

B00008PC2O|5.0|Terminator is a really good movie,but all fans will agree that T2 really delivers all the top notch action!!.This sequel is,needless to say,is even better than the first one,and the T2-Extreme DVD really did justice to this great classic.The sound and picture quality is just awesome!!.A great sci fi action movie!!.All hail the governator!!!
B000AJJNPY|1.0|i don't know what wrong with all you people who think this album is worth buying. this is the most boring record i ever heard, there's nothing interesting in this experimental sounds. i think that even this guys from sigur ros were so blody boring while recording this... <br /> <br />i wish i can take my money back...
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica circa 1990....BIG known only for speed/thrash <br /> <br />Big change here...but doesnt disapoint at all great album....get it if your a fan of any music in my opinion but im a huge metallica fan and i like this 8th best. Only ones that dont beat it are Garage Inc. and ReLoad. <br /> <br />St. Anger is good too real good so i love metallica all around
0786886811|3.0|Boy, is this book confusing. As many have stated in reviews of the hardback version, the ingredients amounts are off, sometimes waaaay off. I was hoping these errors would have been corrected in this new 2005 paperback version -- but no.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity after receiving the book, I went to Nigella's official website and looked at three of the recipes from this book reprinted on the site. When you click on the American equivalent the ingredient amounts shown there differ -- sometimes dramatically enough to guarantee disaster -- from the printed book (U.S. version) in all three recipes. For instance, the Chocolate Cherry Cupcakes: in the printed version before me it calls for 1/2 cup sugar; on the website: 3/4 cup of sugar (no wonder a previous reviewer complained they weren't sweet enough). In the book: 1 cup \\"self-rising cake flour\\" (an item that American bakers don't even use -- and this item crops up everywhere in the book!); on the website: 1 cup all-purpose flour + 1 tsp baking powder + 1/4 tsp baking soda. For the icing the book calls for 1/3 cup + 1 TB heavy cream; the website: 1/2 cup.<br /><br />But the scariest discrepancy is in the recipe for Coconut Macaroons. The book: 1/3 cup sugar; website: 1/2 cup. Book: 2 TB ground almonds; website: 1/3 cup. But here's the kicker: Book: 1 cup + 2 TB shredded coconut; website: 3 1/3 cups! That's not even close! Needless to say I now have very little confidence in these recipes.<br /><br />So. Three stars because I like Nigella and her writing, and because the book is very handsome. But I'm returning my copy and ordering the UK version -- I'd rather deal with metric conversions than these appalling mistakes.
B00025ETIW|4.0|MCR's follow up album to Bullets is a good album. The fast guitar solos and rocking beat are fun. So why not get it? Let me list a few warnings.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are depressing, suicidal, and almost satanic. Songs that talk about suicide, slitting wrists, drugs, etc, are not the best things to be listening to. Don't get me wrong, I like this band, and they are very talented, but they're lyrics are disturbing and moving in the wrong ways.  <br /> <br />I went to barnes and noble to buy this record, but saw the PA sticker, and read the lyrics before I bought it. I would advise the same for you.  <br /> <br />I would not be writing this review if it were not for one of my best friends, Karrie. Karrie was a broody seventeen year old girl, with a broken family. She purchased this CD, and shortly after, started complaining about how bad life was. Thre months later she committed suicide because \\"My Chemical Romance's lyrics opened up my eyes to what I needed to do\\", Her suicide note enclosed.  <br /> <br />So please, pay attention to this review, and buy at your own risk, for the behaviors that come with the disturbing lyrics may not be favorable.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Do you like Sci-Fi?  Do you like old westerns?  Then you WILL like Firefly.  This is space cowboy in action, kinda like Cowboy Bebop, but live.  I bet you will fall in love with one character and say,\\"Yup, that's me if I were in space\\".  Some of this is cheesey, some of it is tounge-in-cheek fun.  I really enjoyed it!<br /><br />~David
0446677450|5.0|All I can say is you have to read this for yourself! This is the book to help you get where you want to go financially!
0142004235|5.0|This book was very, very good from beginning to end. I especially liked John Steinbeck's conflictedness over whether human nature is good or evil. I won't go into the resolution and conclusion that Steinbeck comes to throughout the course of the book because it would ruin the climax for future readers. My advice to readers would be to approach this book with a mind ready to decode profound meanings. This way, the reader and the work will have the relationship that both deserve.
B000001FS3|4.0|To begin with, I am not a u2 fan, but this album, when it came into my hands for no apparent reason, was some thing incedible. I never thought I'd like it, but it turned out to be a great album. it's consistant, nice, pleasant, everything good. This album is something really special and any music fan should have it. In my opinion, it's u2's best work.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Just finished the documentary and while I have seen much of this footage (Don't Look Back is an incredible document)and heard most of the music, I am still blown away by Dylan and what he did and the time he did it in.  Four hours dedicated to such a short and intense span of Dylan's career only added to my belief that he was the Master of Words and the Chameleon of irony.  Scorsese's participation as puzzle master, piecing together existing footage and historical context added to the depth and pleasure of this fine work. Scorcese's editing around the JFK assassination was excellent adding depth to well known footage, as well as Dylan's impact on the time.    During the press conferences and interviews, Dylan continuously denied his role as the leader, genius, voice.  Yet his writing, playing and song selection spoke louder and clearer than any interview.      The culminating event- Newport '65 is covered amply and brilliantly with many perspectives presented.  After 15 minutes of \\"electric\\" performance (electric in many ways)Dylan and his band leave the stage to hoots and boos. An obviously shaken Peter Yarrow promises, pleads and hopes that Dylan will return with his acoustic guitar.  After a few tense moments Dylan, equally shaken, looking drawn out and sweating, steps to the mike and sings Baby Blue with such intensity and enunciation that I got emotional sitting on my sofa.  The reluctant leader of protest songs pushed himself away with his own eloquent words-  Was that song choice a coincidence, or was he in full control with the ultimate protest?  Check it out and you be the judge.    This is great stuff and I am ready for more whenever Mr. Scorsese wants to delve back in...
0780622650|5.0|Picture this: the girl/guy of your dreams from high school that you never could get enough of, . . . well, things changed, and you found yourself somewhere else.  Anyway, there they are again, . . . more beautiful than ever.  But now they have grown into an exponential beauty, physically and spiritually.  So, do you love them more or less than before?<br /><br />I think I know why some \\"fans\\" of the original 60s TV series Lost in Space hated the movie.  They never really loved the series or science anyway.  Maybe it was just something cool for the time.  And, while they were expected to extrapolate the \\"next thing\\" after the series cancellation, they could not.  Possibly this \\"techie\\" ended up like the average guy, following all the coolest trends until they are not cool anymore, who rocks in the 80s, 90s, and 00s, just like their mom does.  Now, is that REALLY cool??? (NO, . . . it's just cool in a jar) Or just the newest corporate campaign.  Granted, whoever visualized the Robinsons in the mid 60s truly were visionary.  Currently, cool is common and plastic, and way more status quo than avant garde. Moreover, Lost in Space was never cool.  It was fantastic.  It took imagination.  It inspired.  It entertained.  However, the series is very dated today, and can only hold sentimental value.<br /><br />I recently rented Season One of the TV Series,  and boy did it bring back memories.  I remember almost everything, no matter how corny it actually is today.  And it was way more melodramatic than I remember (i.e., families were more closely knit and touchy-feely than they are today). Too often, we are distracted from joining together as a Nation with imagination and true vision by some new refugees or natural disaster, which causes us to focus more on pitying and fundamental Abraham Maslow levels rather than abstract thought.  Although, sympathy is what makes America great, we will need one day to REALLY compete in the tech sphere, and produce some more world-class ideas.<br /><br />In the movie, sound, props, editing, directing, and script are all superb. The movie company had to append several years of the TV series meaningfully within two hours.  I feel that they succeeded.  There are more than a few thrills, laced with sentiment (even the bloop/blarp brought back memories) and suspense to keep you entertained.<br /><br />I appreciate the complexity of the plot, which some may think moronic.  The premise of the TV series was that each week resulted in a tense cliffhanger that you could easily predict the outcome of or not. There was always the . . . \\"tune in next week . . . same time same channel\\" ending to leave you anticipating more.  Thus, the movie had to bring all the beloved elements of the series together in a meaningful manner AND take us someplace that we have never been before.  It was a brilliant idea to flesh out the concept of father and son never having  quality time to bond.  Thus, younger Will, older Will, and the father all converged at the climax in a scenario that made sense of the alien mechanical spiders, diabolical Dr. Smith, macho Major West, and dealing with being lost in space.  Surprisingly, Matt LeBlanc was well suited as Major West.  He played the part with 110% the verve of the original character.  Same for the others.  Penny may have been very bitchy in the movie to her coolly analytical mien in the series, or Judy revealing more character in the movie, but finally, I warmed more to the new Penny, and even found her more beautiful than the first, and Judy still a little too distant for my tastes. Nevertheless, everyone was played more abstractly and not so naively emotional.  This is better, seeming more sophisticated and scientific at once.<br /><br />I accept this story as the rightful metamorphosis that it is.  Hoorah Hypergate!  Maybe, when real scientific thinking becomes the status quo, instead of just working quadratic functions without knowing why or writing essays to get a grade and never really saying anything, more people that claim to love science will be able to appreciate great ideas for what they are, and be prepared to always go to the next level/challenge.<br /><br />Relax and enjoy a great movie if you knew the Robinsons in the 60s or are just meeting them for the first time.  Maybe, you love science too, in any way, shape, or form it comes in.claim to love science will be able to appreciate great ideas for what they are, and be prepared to always go to the next level/challenge.

B000056TKC|5.0|While many people hail Karajan and his Berlin Philharmonic forces with interpreting the best Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, I am not alone in stating that conductor Ferenc Frisay, who died of cancer in the early 60's, was a genuine rival and could have even surpassed Karajan. His version of the Ninth is absolutely brilliant. The tempi is conducted at a compelling pace, not too fast or too slow, though Fricsay has conducted in usually swift fashion. The miraculous exactitude of the strings falling and raising can be heard over this remastered disc. The opening Allegro movement is powerful, visceral and majestic. The Scherzo is played in the finest way I've ever heard. The slow, spiritual and romantic Andante Cantabile is heartbreaking and tender, Fricsay conducting at his finest. This long sigh is delivered with touching pathos by the Berlin forces. The Finale, with its famous use of chorus \\"Ode to Joy\\" is joyous itself. The cast here includes celebrated singers like the unsurpassed baritone Dietrich Fischer Dieskau (in young 1958 voice) and the mezzo soprano Maureen Forrester sounds ravishing. This was the first LP on Stereo of Beethoven's 9th and thus is a collector's item as well. Fans of Fricsay will want to own this recording, and it does indeed rival Karajan's version. If I were to recommend three great Beethoven 9th recordings I would say: Fricsay, Karajan and Solti's versions.
0060763280|5.0|If you are thinking about buying this book, then you obviously would like to be a millionaire.<br /><br />Do you actually like millionaires and respect what they have achieved, or do you resent them for what they have, or think rich people are bad?<br /><br />If you resent them then you may have have a poor person's attitude to wealth, and think that by becoming wealthy you may turn into that very thing you despise, and accordingly sabotage yourself subconsciously.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a very good book, with proven formulas that work. For example, thoughts, feeling, actions = results. Rich people focus on opportunities, poor people focus on obstacles.<br /><br />As you read this book, you will discover many interesting insights into how to become wealthy. You will also discover the mindsets of rich people compared to poor people.  It is very illuminating to see the connection between how people think and how they do.<br /><br />For example, I have a friend who is quite spiritual, yet his attitude towards money is if I win the lottery, I would give most of it away, as I would feel guilty having all that money. What a limiting belief to have.<br /><br />If you're like me then reading through the contrasting mindsets of rich people and poor people will be most illuminating.  For exmaple when I read that 'poor people focus on problems, rich people focus on opportunities, I totally changed my mindset, it has become my mantra, and using it has enabled me to look beyond the problem which may or may not be real, and to go for the opportunity.<br /><br />I also highly recommend Think and grow rich by Napoleon Hill, which as far as I am concerned is the ultimate work on this subject.<br /><br />Hope you find this helpful.

B00005Y7KX|4.0|It is very interesting that in amazon.fr the DVD has very low rate, one or two stars while the soundtrack CD there got the five stars. <br />The greatness of this musical totally are lead by music of Rechard Coccinante and voices of main castings, especially four male roles, Frollo, Gringore, Quasimodo, and Phobus. Many people talked about Esmeralda, I prefer Noa to Segara. <br />As I have some experience of music composition I can see there is some technique to make the music dramatic. Though I feel he uses too much that simple technique, I can't help to listen it again and again. <br />Then look at the stage, I don't think the performance, including dances, reaches the level that the music has.  <br />May be because I listened the music first. This could happen. When you read a great book such as Hemingway then watch the movie of the book, you would never be satisfied, would you? <br />However one benefit of seeing DVD is subtitle, as I am a French Learner this is a good opportunity to listen French and also check the spelling and the meaning. Yes. The translation into English there is poor, what kind of language they use, it is something Frenglish??  <br /> <br />
B000002VMD|5.0|OMG, I love this CD.  I love the movie which grossed over $400 million world wide.  I still listen to this CD.  I have the movie on dvd, the cd and the record. I love Whitney Houston Brown.  I grew up listening to her.  I was 13 when the Bodyguard hit the scene and I was taken with it.  The tracks that Whitney laid were sick. The licks and turns and flows she put on I Will Always Love You were just classic. She ripped that song to shreds and didn't apologize for it. This album continued to define the majesty of the voice of Mrs. Whitney Houston Brown.  The way she can make you feel the emotion when she sings is unmatched by any other in our time.  Much love for Mrs. Whitney Houston Brown and for the Bodyguard.  LOVED IT.

B00063MBU8|1.0|Simple plan would have to be one of the worst bands i have ever bought in my life i regret buying both of these albums and recomend bands like seven wiser, flaw, godsmack and disturbed which produce REAL (underlined)music that actually sounds like rock. <br /> <br />If you want a bunch of guy that dont know how to produce music then i recomend you try these guys coz they cant play music and pierre cant sing for crap. If you want a bunch of pop pansies then buy this otherwise go back to the search toolbar and search for ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!
0452282152|2.0|<br />Incredible in the sense of being difficult to believe, and not in the sense of being amazingly good. Three examples: <br /> <br />An uneducated maid should not be expected to understand art better than an accomplished painter -- especially one of the stature of Vermeer. Yet Griet tells us she changed the composition of two of Vermeer's paintings, including the title piece, noting that she could see what needed to be changed before Vermeer did.    <br /> <br />Second, Griet speaks with an unexpectedly lyrical voice for someone who cannot read (except for her name). How she came to learn such poetical construction without proper schooling is unclear. <br /> <br />Finally, the scene in the alley with Pieter -- after Griet shows her hair to Vermeer -- defies all credibility. It is completely out of character. <br /> <br />This book is a fine diversion for a few hours, but it is not a great novel.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Coldplay has always done wonders with pulling emotions out of you with sobering melodies and singly sweet lyrics.  The \\"glow\\", as it were, of the sound of this band is uncommon and unfound anywhere else; their songs have a way of making one feel guilt and anguish over things they had done, but pulling them right back up with confident encouragement.  Given, emo fanboys and grunge enthusiasts tend to find little to fulfill them in any of Coldplay's nicely sized 5-minute (give or take) tracks.  For the preponderance of the populace, however, the albums do justly.  Without the usual emphasis on instrumentation, Coldplay focuses on lulling chords and vocals that play well off of each other, rendering an original sound.  That is left with essentially no debate.<br /><br />However, despite their legendary status they have achieved, X&Y stands to be, in my opinion, the least compelling album in their triad.  Many problems that I have with this album are as such:<br /><br />- The acoustic, almost folk, resonance of their first album (Sparks, Yellow, Parachutes, etc.) is all but gone.<br /><br />- The excellent usage of keyboards, synthesizers, pianos and the like have unfortunately received much less attention compared to their other albums.  You're left with What If and Speed of Sound in this one.<br /><br />- Many songs have some crummy electric guitar riffs that drown out the rest of the vocals and instruments.<br /><br />- Melodies have been recycled in a very bad way.  Speed of Sound, track 7, is the most prime example.  Clocks had a 5th, 2nd, 2nd, 6th chord sequence that was carried throughout.  I'll give you one guess what Speed of Sound does.<br /><br />- Songs need a plethora of listens until they grow on you.<br /><br />- Political messages are always unnecessary, but they apparently felt the need in Twisted Logic, an otherwise fantastic song.<br /><br />On the plus side, they still have a great set of lyrics, a great tempo, a great amount of songs, and a great starting track.  My primary biff with X&Y is that while many songs start very promisingly, such as Talk, What If, and Twisted Logic, they finish in weakly in a semi-decent slur of mushy guitar and tacky 80's drumbeats.  If you have an ear for music, you know that there is too much to be desired in this album to put it on the level of Parachutes or A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Look back to the former for satisfaction.<br /><br />3 stars is my bid for X&Y.rimary biff with X&Y is that while many songs start very promisingly, such as Talk, What If, and Twisted Logic, they finish in weakly in a semi-decent slur of mushy guitar and tacky 80's drumbeats.

B00000J7JO|4.0|After one album and tour, Dave Navarro and the Red Hot Chili Peppers parted ways, amicably by all reports.  This left vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea (and to a lesser extent drummer Chad Smith) in a familiar position-- without a guitarist for the fourth time in the band's career.  Navarro had replaced John Frusciante, and his replacement would be none other than... John Frusciante.<br /><br />This reunion, combined with some real standout material, has led this album to be revered as the greatest thing since sliced bread, and certainly it's always thought to be a distinct improvement over \\"One Hot Minute\\".  While I do enjoy the record, I'm not certain I agree with either sentiment.<br /><br />One thing is for certaint hough, the album is diverse-- sliding effortlessly between old-style Chili Peppers funk/punk (the superb \\"Get On Top\\"), alternative rock (\\"Parallel Universe\\"), sometimes with harmony drenched choruses (\\"Otherside\\"), straight-up hardcore punk (\\"Right on Time\\") and delicate acoustic ballads (the unnervingly superb \\"Road Trippin'\\"), one could not accuse the album of resting on laurels.  But with so much movement, it's highly unlikely everything will work out, and certainly several tracks misfire-- \\"Emit Remmus\\" and its sustained feedback drenched guitars and the churning \\"I Like Dirt\\" come to mind, but a lot of the material just feels underdeveloped, like delicate ballad \\"Porcelein\\" and funky alt-rock piece \\"This Velvet Glove\\".  The band would master this on their next album, but for now, it's not there yet.  Still, there's enough great material on here that even more casual listeners will want this one, and it's hard to rationalize any album with as many standouts as this one being rated lower than four stars.  Recommended.
B00006JDS4|5.0|BASED ON A TRUE STORY. THIS LATE 1970'S FILM IS ABOUT A WOMAM WHO WAS RAPED AND TORTURED BY A GROUP OF HIPPIES THEN LEFT HER TO DIE. BUT LOOK OUT... SHE COMES BACK WITH A VENGENCE. PERSONLY IN MY OPINION, SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO. LET'S FACE IT, SHE WAS GANG-RAPED, TORTURED AND THEN LEFT TO DIE. ONE REVIEWER SAID THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE GAS CHAMBER FOR KILLING THOSE MEN. WELL I WILL SAY THIS IN HER DEFENSE. IN SOME WAYS SHE DID THE RIGHT THING. SHE REALLY HAD NO CHOICE. 1 WHAT IF THEY MAY HAVE CAME BACK WEEKS OR MONTHS LATER A TRIED IT AGAIN, 2. WHAT IF THE MEN DID THIS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN. THAT'S WHERE I HAVE LEARNED IN ONE RESPECT... YOU DON'T MESS WITH WOMEN LIKE THAT. IF YOU HURT THEM, IN SOME CASES THEY WILL KILL YOU. IT IS THAT SIMPLE. I SAT AND WATCHED THIS MOVIE, THESE ANIMALS RAPE AND TORURE THIS HELPLESS WOMAN WHO WAS A VICTUM FROM THE MOMENT THIS SICK INCIDENT HAPPENED. SHE DID NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THAT. AND SPEAKING AS A REAL MAN... WHICH I AM. THE STORIES AGAINST HER AND ABOUT HER ARE PURE SICK AND PURE PUKE. AND AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE. SHE SEEMED TO BE A REALLY NICE KIND GENTLE WOMAN WAS PRUTALLY ROBBED FOR NOTHING. TO THESE SICK MEN WHO DID THIS TO THAT WOMAN... IT WAS A PARTY THAT WAS NOT FUN AT ALL. TO THIS INNOCENT WOMAN... IT WAS GREAT JUSTICE. AND IF SHE HADN'T THE MONSTERS WOULD HAVE DONE THIS TO ANOTHER WOMAN. I AM AGAINST VIOLENCTS. BUT UNDER THESE CONTITIONS OF THE BRUTALITY, THIS IS ONE MOVIE THAT GUYS WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT EVER RAPING OR TORURING A WOMAN AGAIN. THERE WAS NO RESPECT FOR THIS WOWMAN WHATS SO EVER. SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO WRITTING HER FIRST BOOK WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THIS GOES OUT TO THE REAL LIFE WOMAN. I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THIS. THIS WAS WRONG AND THSES MEN PAIED THE ULTIMATE PRICE, AND THEY DESERVED WHAT THEY GOT. SURE, THERE IS VIOLENTS IN WOMEN. I HAVE SEEN IT. BUT IN THIS CASE THIS WAS A MEANS FO PROTECTING HERSELF AND OTHER WOMEN. AND POSSIBLY MEN, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I REALLY DOUBT THAT ONE. SHE WAS THE JUSTICE. THAT'S IT. IT CERTAINLY MADE ME THINK TWICE ABOUT EVER DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I WOULD NOT DO THAT KIND OF THING ANYWAY. PLEASE UNDERSTAND... THOSE MEN WOULD HAVE DONE THIS TO SOMEBODY ELSE IF SHE DID NOT KILL THIS MEN. QUITE FRANKLY, SHE WON IN THE END. ALTHOUGH VERY EXTREME... THIS WAS AND IS A WOMAN NO MAN WILL EVER MESS WITH EVER AGAIN.
B0001Z2RUK|5.0|An amazing collection of great songs by a band on a single CD. The sound is fresh, the music is great, the vocals are incredible. Almost every song could be released as a single. I never imagined a piano a drumkit and a microphone fillup the room in such a way. Not Travis, not Coldplay, just Keane.
B00000273M|5.0|This has all the best stuff they are famous for.  the entire album \\"different light\\" is very good, but you should get this instead because it has extra stuff like \\"hazy shade of winter\\" and \\"going to liverpool\\"  The bangles were very special and very fun to listen to, and if you get this you will enjoy it a lot.  Its very 80's, but extremely good.  IF that sounds cool to you, do not hesitate to pick it up.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I have been a Beatles (and mostly George Harrison) fan since they appeared on Ed Sullivan all those years ago. This cd made me see George and his music with fresh eyes.<br /><br />  I received \\"Brainwashed\\" as a gift and was not in a hurry to listen to it, to be honest. I was afraid it would be a \\"downer.\\" How wrong I was! Yes, there are some heart-wrenchingly touching moments on this cd, however, the overall tone is wondrously hopeful for a man who knew his days on Earth were numbered. Perhaps it was because of his spiritual beliefs, or maybe it was due to the fact that his own son Dhani (who obviously loved his father dearly) and his buddy Jeff Lynne (who appreciated his friend's talent)treated the production with such care and respect for George's wishes. Whatever the reason, it seemed the more I listened to this album, the more I wanted to hear it yet again. It's all here: love, spirituality, lust, mortality, happiness and sadness, fun. I guess you could say it's like the life of a man who was, according to a line from \\"Pisces Fish:\\" \\"proof of all life's contradictions,\\" a man who was definitely much more than \\"The Quiet One.\\"
B000003S0P|5.0|I love this album like I love all of king crimson's albums, the only complaint I have is that Wetton's singing is kind of irritating on \\"one more red nightmare.\\" (his singing is actually kind of bad in general, he rushes things a bit).  however, the beastly riffing heard on that song more than makes up for it.  \\"starless\\" is beautiful and dark, like many Crim songs.  This ranks among their heaviest works, it might even be their best.  I recommend new fans start with \\"In the court of...\\" \\"discipline\\" and this album.  Then get \\"larks tounges...\\" and maybe \\"starless and bible black\\"  This cd is definitely one of their best, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it IS their best.  It is definitely in the top 3, however.
B00079018K|5.0|Michael A. Zarara wondered if Kasabian would be able to pull their music off live, in front of an audience. Well, I just saw Kasabian/Jet/Oasis live last night in Atlanta and I am happy to report that their live performance is awesome (btw, that was the best Oasis gig I've seen -- been to 4 of them). In fact, I'd rather have some of the tracks on the album done as the live versions, as some of them sound better live (yes, with screaming guitars and all). Their job as an opening band for the opening band was freaking awesome, and all the tracks you'd think couldn't be done easily live were done heavy, loud, and full of energy.  <br /> <br />Michael A. Zarara also mentioned that Kasabian needed to prove him \\"and Noel Gallager wrong\\". I don't know what he's talking about, Kasabian already proved themselves to Noel - they are on tour with Oasis simply because Noel loves the crap out of them.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Neil Young has always been a musical chameleon.  Shifting from hard rock to rockabilly to grunge to futuristic synth music, he's tried every music genre.  But the style he keeps returning to is country-rock.  Prairie Wind is yet another superb album in this vein.  The past few years haven't been kind to Mr. Young with the death of his father and the mother of his first child or finding out that he has a brain aneurysm.  With the sense of loss and mortality, Prairie Wind reflects on life and family.  \\"The Painter\\" brilliantly sets the tone for the album as it a brooding, moody piece that shows music gives eternal life to its artists.  \\"Far From Home\\" is a lovely ode to his parents and \\"Here For You\\" is a sweet song for his kids that has a great harmonica solo.  \\"Falling From The Face Of The Earth\\" is a gentle lament and \\"He Was The King\\" is a goofy salute to Elvis Presley, but one done with spirit.  \\"When God Made Me\\" has a full gospel chorus and \\"This Old Guitar\\" is the best track on the album with its simple story and laid-back charm.  Country-rock is the skin Mr. Young feels most comfortable in and Prairie Wind is his best album in a decade.
6304779356|4.0|I remember this movie so well, as I fell for it hook, line and sinker with the marketing ploys towards the teen set.  It was the greatest thing ever, boy was I gullible!  Still, seeing it now it still is a pretty good movie.    Two all American boys, Michael and Sam Emerson, move to Santa Carla, CA after their mother's divorce in with their grandfather.  Grandpa is a hoot, doing crazy old man things (fixing up his house, taxidermy, having a second shelf in the fridge marked Old Fart, etc.), and they do their best to adjust.  Michael is smiten with a beautiful stranger from the boardwalk, Sam is consumed by the comic book store.  What starts off as a seeming innocent teenage interest evolves into a horror story.  The beautiful stranger, Star, is being used as bait by David, the leader of a motorcycle gang, to bewitch unsuspecting innocents like Michael into their trap.  They are vampires looking to bring others into the circle.    Keifer Sutherland was right on in this movie as the villan, and Jason Patric was a good choice for the lead.  There were a few things that annoyed me, Corey Feldman and that other guy, the Frog brothers, who saw themselves as junior Nam vets (who probably got all their information from watching \\"Nam movies\\" from the 80s).  They were tough guys on a mission who were actually not all that fearless.  As usually happened in the briefly hyped \\"2 Coreys\\" movies, Corey Haim was actually the sober one who the story was evolving around and was funnier as the strait man.  (Sad really, compaired to what he is today.)  This would end up being the crowning achievement of the 2 Coreys hype, as it was received well by audiences and finance (though not a critical success).    From there the inevitable confrontation scene errupts at their house.  Explosions, bloody impalement, and even a melting scene (Best quote of movie: \\"We trashed the one that looks like Twisted Sister\\" in the bathtub\\") leave for the audience wanting more.  There's even a twist at the end.  The special effects and make up were good and made it all look believable.  Enjoy it for some action adventure entertainment, but don't fall for the teen hype again which they worked overtime to obtain!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|A warm farewell Cash gave to the world, this world he felt troubled during the last part of his life as he stated in \\"When the man comes around\\" that came from a dream he had in England and in the liner notes of this last release, however he felt also this world like home sorrounded by his loved ones; friends, music and his wife, friends were integral part of this last Cash adventure and legacy, Fiona apple, Don Henley, John Frusciante, Nick Cave, Billy Preston and Rick Rubin and cuts were choosen in a very interesting way, Hurt composed by Trent Reznor, Personal Jesus by L. Gore, bridge over troubled water by Paul Simon, hung my head by Sting and the nice and full of hope well meet again wich seemed to be the \\"so long\\" of this recording , Cash job has been done almost as perfectly as if were planned even his death and doesnt matter if you were introduced to this man music decades ago or recently the effect he can cause on you is the same you feel amazed <br />HM
0802130208|5.0|Amazing how the wheel spins. While at my Mothers home in Lake Charles havining \\"evaporated\\" my family from the Apocalypse,I stumbled on the brown edged copy of \\"Dunces\\"in my old bedroom,20 years in hibernation.Traumatized as I was Something made me start to read the book,partially to imprint the lifestyle that will be forever changed. Three weeks later,having completed my journeys, power back on, house under repair, ADHD moments receding like the floodwaters...I finished The Novel.It should be required reading for all literate returnees,it helped me remember and forget,to understand the tragedy and absurd high comedy,it's truly a love story on many levels but this reading it was a story of a lost love...postscipt...I now have to deal with the fact that my childhood home and room in Lake Charles I found this treasure was destroyed by Rita...I'm afraid my valve is shutting down!
0767819659|4.0|I am afraid that some of the reviewers have gotten their facts wrong. My daughter is 3 and sometimes we watch it twice in the same day. In this movie, Madeline is an orphan, but the other girls are not. This is made evident in several scenes. Also it must be a school, not an orphanage, since only Madeline is an orphan. Lord Covington is not the principal, he is the owner. <br /> <br />I have not read the books or seen the cartoons, but I am told that some of the storyline is the basis for several of the books. If that is the case, it has been interwoven wonderfully. Since I haven't read the books, I can't tell exactly where one book stops and the next one begins. As a matter of fact, I can't tell how much time elapses from the beginning to the end, other than I don't remember seeing snow, and I am guessing that it snows in Paris in the winter. I am guessing 3 months max and probably in the spring.

0446677450|1.0|I don't doubt that a book written using emotionally manipulative language pandering to the naive and unsuccessful masses is going to be appealing. And if you're one of those people that do nothing but spend all your money and have done little in the way of investing and accumulating wealth, a book like this MIGHT even be useful in kickstarting you to doing something differently. But after you reach that point, STOP and read REAL MEANINGFUL books not FLUFF like this that have very little actual useful substantive advice. <br /> <br />Motivation might be the only possible redeeming value of the book because much of the specifics is just DRIVEL and full of nonsense and potentially dangerous. <br /> <br />Let's start with the supposedly brilliant insight that a house is not an asset but a \\"liability\\" because it costs money to own and maintain it. Yes, the costs of ownership, the mortgage, these things are liabilities that can't be overlooked. However, considering the fact that part of your mortgage builds equity instead of going down the drain as rent, that housing expenses can't be avoided even if you don't buy a house, and that homes continue to appreciate, its definitely an net asset in MOST (not all) cases over renting. I can tell you personally that I am way ahead having bought my house 2 years ago than if I continued renting, yet according to Kiyosaki, I actually bought a \\"liability\\" which gives the absurd impression that I would have been better off not buying it (as that is the usual definition of \\"liability\\" not some bizarre use of it as per Kiyosaki). <br /> <br />Next, let's go into the all the disparaging things Kiyosaki says about people who get a good education and work in a profession as an employee. Sure, it'd be much better to be a founder and big owner of a company like, say, Dell, Google, etc. than merely an employee. But its pretty dangerous to actually think that you're going to be the next Micheal Dell, Gates, Trump etc and thus decide to quit school and eschew completely working as an employee. <br /> <br />That's not to say one shouldn't dream big and attempt to be an entrepreneur but very few make it big. The vast majority of businesses fail in less than two years and many people go broke trying. Even those that moderately succeed end up working a lot harder with a lot more stress than a professional employee without earning more. This attitude and advice makes as much sense as telling someone that school and getting a good job is a waste of time and should be looked down on because you can make so much more as a pro athlete. <br /> <br />If you have dreams and ideas and think you can be the next Gates, by all means go for it and as long as you don't do it unethically I wish you great success. But keep in mind that on average, a well paid professional employee spending wisely and investing regularly, with great discipline, and carefully over the long term is going to be well ahead most of the time no matter how much Kiyosaki thumbs his nose at that. I myself have build a net worth of nearly half a million dollars at 31 so achieving it definitely CAN be done. <br /> <br />And NO that net worth isn't from being lucky in the housing boom, only $100K of assets is in real estate equity. NO it isn't from getting lucky from stock options during the dot-com boom, I haven't earned much from options most of it being underwater. NO I didn't inherit any of it. NO I didn't obtain any of it from gambling. NO I don't live as a pauper. (I live in a nice fairly new 1800 sq ft house in a good area, own a 1 year old Camry that I bought for $23k cash, have cable TV, high speed internet, eat well, etc and live a fairly comfortable life, I just don't spend foolishly on junk like most people). And finally NO I do NOT and have never had even a six figure income.
0743424425|5.0|The Shining by Stephen King is by the best book I've ever read. The story is about a dead-beat author, Jack Torrance, and his family and his new job as the caretaker of an old hotel. What he doesn't know is the secrets that wait for him inside of the Overlook Hotel. Jack's son Danny has a gift, a \\"shining\\", as the Overlook's chef Hallorann says. The family is isolated during the winter, and if you have been alone with someone for too long, you can only understand half of what the Torrance family is going through.  <br /> I enjoy reading scary books, and this was by far the most worth it. I read this book for my English class. Our assignment was to read any book we wanted. I had previously read King's Pet Semetary and since I enjoyed that book I would try another one of his books because I like his work. Pet Semetary was a good read, but I was not really captivated by the book until the very end of the book. The Shining grabs you at the very beginning. There are many things you want to find out. For example, I wanted to figure out what the constant mention of \\"REDRUM\\" was. I don't do much reading on my own, but this book made me want to read it. For all scary, suspense, thriller, and exciting book fans, I highly recommend this book. Stephen King created an American masterpiece when he wrote... The Shining.  <br /> <br />
B00000DGUM|3.0|How can anyone not include these great songs: <br />\\"Wasted Time\\"; \\"Here I am\\"; \\"In a Darkened Room\\"; Firesign. <br />Skid Row fans must admit this is an incomplete compilation.
1401206905|5.0|This book was a great beginning to a character that has been done in every imaginable way. The art was perfect, and I mean perfect.. fit the story wonderfully. The story had me interested with every page. A awesome retelling for sure that fills in the cracks for a modern interpretation. A+ no doubt.
B0007O38F8|2.0|This cd is ok. I could not understand why there are pictures of guns on the inside cover. I used the insert to wrap my fish! Nice image for the kids talking about shooting people , and someone licking your lolipop! Total garbage as far as content. Let the code of the steets take care of itself. This sucka mc talking about murdering people is a disgrace. Who gives a rats fanny if you were shot 9 times. That is nuthin to be proud of. There is nuthin new or fresh on this cd. No growth as an artist. <br />The rap community does not need this negative type of music. Some of the beats are good on the cd , but 50 cent does not rhyme clear to me. A lot of his words are bunched together. This <br />fake rapper wont be around along. Not a Hip Hop legend here. <br />
1401201911|4.0|This is one of those books that I find myself looking forward to every page. The story is original and the art is fantastic (coloring supreme!). The ending seemed alittle overly heady but wasn't so much that it spoiled the book overall. I typically like \\"what If \\" stories becasue they don't have to follow the rules and fit the characters in a nice little box of comformity. This book does a good job of looking at the other side of the coin. I personally would give it a A-
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Review no. 1000. Whew! This is a privilege. An absolute must-have for any and all true Beatles fans. All 27 of the Fab Four's number one hits. They're all here. Tunes I haven't heard very much in recent years. Cuts like \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Eight Days A Week\\", the guitar gem \\"Day Tripper\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"All You Need Is Love\\" among others make this release hard to resist. Essential.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Of course Cream isn't playing with the same ferociousness they did when they were in their 20s back in the 1960s, but name one band from that era that still does. The Who's Pete Townshend still has his manic-style of guitar thrashing, but that's about it. The Stones are still good, but not as intense as they once were. <br />On to the Cream DVD. Great picture, great audio. It's widescreen, with a lot of detail and depth to the visuals. The colors are lively and the vibe of the show is caught well on this video. Sound is very, very good, with lots of Jack Bruce's bass (taking a less \\"dirty\\" tone here than in the 1960s) and full, well-rounded drum sound from Ginger Baker. His toms and bass drums boom, and his high-hat, which he miraculously works with his foot through the entire DVD, helps add mid- and high-range sounds in the absence of a second guitar or keyboards. Here's Cream, the original three - Bruce, Baker and Eric Clapton, playing together again. And it sounds great. Yes, there not as firey as they once were, bu they still jam. Baker's \\"Toad\\" is a treat, and his drum solo, with its swing-style and floating vibe, is very impressive. Bruce and Clapton trade off verses on \\"White Room,\\" which is a nice change from the original recording, although not necessarily better. The new DVD shows Cream to have much more of a sense of humor on-stage than some might think. Clapton, Baker and Bruce are seen smiling at each other constantly, showing that they've kissed and made up, so to speak. As a musician, it's fun to watch their eye-contact with each other, wondering if some of those smiles are from possible mistakes they're making on their instruments. Regardless, they're amazing musicians, and no flubbed notes are evident (except on the alternate extra of \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" where Clapton misses his first vocal cue and then laughs). Clapton also seems more relaxed on-stage than in other vidoes of his solo concerts. It's remarkable, considering that he was stresseda bit from not being able to rely on a second guitar and keyboard. But that's the charm of this video. Three instruments (four, if you count Bruce's harmonica, and he works gloriously into overtime here) and three voices, and that's all. The video was taken from four nights at the Royal Albert Hall, and although it could have felt like a chop job, rocketing back and forth between nights, it doesn't. The date is subtly put in the corner of the screen whenever the concert changes,  and it feels like a smoothly-edited documentary movie. It's very, very good, with the camera and editing personnel not afraid to hold a shot for longer than 7 or 8 seconds. The audience shots mostly are held to a minimum. There are some cool shots of the Hall's lobby during the concert, and some outdoor shots. Surprisngly, they work. <br />The extra interviews are brief, but all right. It's interesting that Clapton says he kind of initiated the reunion after Jack fell ill a year or two ago. Jack does look awfully thin in the video, but his bass skills and his vocals are still there. We only hope he's not sick. Watching Baker don Cream 2005 tour shirts throughout the video, the viewer wishes they'd do a full-scale reunion of America, instead of just a few nights in NY in October. <br />A very good DVD to own. <br />Peace

0064407667|4.0|After already having seen the movie, I decided to invest in reading the books.  Bk #1, THE BAD BEGINNING, only took me an hour to finish, and it was an enjoyable--if dark--read.<br /><br />The Baudelaire children--Violet, Klaus, and Sunny--are left orphaned after a mysterious fire destroys their home and kills their parents.  Taken into custody by Mr. Poe, the executor of their parent's estate, they learn that their parent's will states that they must be cared for by a relative.  The closest relative, unbeknownest to the children, is Count Olaf, an actor and leader of a theatre troupe who lives in a dilapitated house on the other side of town.<br /><br />Things, of course, only go from bad to worse after the children move into Count Olaf's home, which is strangely covered inside and out with drawings and representations of a strange-looking eye.  Count Olaf even has a tattoo of the same image on his ankle.  As the Count hatches a scheme to gain control of the Baudelaire fortune, which the children are not privy to until Violet comes of age, the children are alternately scared of their new \\"parent\\" and determined to find a way out of their dreadful situation.<br /><br />I enjoyed this walk on the dark side, and plan on reading Book #2 in the series later today.  That said, however, I think it depends on your child and his or her maturity as to whether this would be a good read for them or not.  Although the reading material is suitable for around 8 years old and up, the book IS dark-natured, and might scare some children.  If they've already seen the movie, they might be prepared for its darkness--if the movie depiction scared them, then hold off on the book for awhile.
B00004TR2G|5.0|...is that this IS the original soundtrack recording. This is the same recording used in the actual film. The old soundtrack released was a re-recording, done by John Williams especially for the soundtrack release, hence variations in track lengths and tempos when compared to this release. <br /> <br />Jaws is a fantastic score - one of John Williams' best, and certainly one of the best scores ever composed. And it is wonderful to finally hear the music as it is heard in the film. The old release had its points, but the sound was muffled and full of tape hiss. This new release has better sound and more music. Recommended.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Much has been made of the Closed Captioning subtitles. I, not being hearing impaired, find it a bit annoying that the studio didn't provide a seperate subtitle option for CC audiences, but it's really nothing big. What is big is that the translation of this film's dialogue, from Japanese to English, is almost completely off in every scene. There are even scenes where the Japanese dialogue is silenced so that they won't have to translate it! Insane! Detail & depth are lost in this Dreamworks release thanks to this horrid translation. The film actually seems vapid and two dimensional thanks to Dreamworks. How could they make a pile of goo out of this masterpiece? Ugh! <br /> <br />I have been lucky enough to see a wonderful fansub of this film and wow, those fans made this film come alive. Do yourself a favor, leave this stinker in the bin and find a fansub, then tell Dreamworks exactly what you think of their poor handling of this wonderful title. <br /> <br />As of September, voice actors from Stand Alone Complex and the first GitS film are working on a proper dub. As far as I know this is just for the UK, who knows if the US will ever see this dub. If it contains the same lose execution and subtitles, then it won't be worth it. Here's to hoping, heh.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Bud is sad.  The motor-cycle racer played by Vincent Gallo is carrying some sort of grief.  We know this because he spends a lot of time driving his van cross country and looking unhappy.  He conveys this unhappiness much of the time by rubbing his face in a way that demonstrates world-weariness.  Do we know WHY he's sad?  Nope, although we suspect pretty strongly it has to do with a girlfriend named Daisy. <br /> <br />If you want to see a movie about a sad man...here you go.  We see the sad man put gas in his van.  We see him purchase a cola at a roadside rest-stop...putting in about 8 coins.  We get to see him drink a bit of it.  We get to see him take his motorcycle out of his van and ride in on the salt flats in Utah.  We even get to see him use a urinal and at one point...take a shower!!  The whole shower we get to experience...and it includes a LOT of face rubbing and pausing to look contemplative. <br /> <br />My favorite scene involves Bud stopping at a little house in California.  He goes to the door and knocks on it.  He waits.  Knocks again.  Waits.  Looks in the window.  Waits.  The scene takes (no exaggeration) at least two minutes.  It tells us Bud can wait long past the time most of us would have given up.  That's how sad he is. <br /> <br />Finally, near the end, Bud checks in to a hotel and we're led to understand that he may be visited by Daisy.  Sure enough, she shows up and they have some dialogue (which is very exciting, because up until now we've had five minutes of dialogue stretched across 70 minutes of film).  The dialogue allows us to learn some things about their relationship, and then we are able to see them kiss a lot and then Daisy (Chloe Sevigny) explicitly performs a sex act on Bud.  It is graphic and not faked.  It is also distinctly unappealing, because Bud berates Daisy throughout the act.  When it's over, we get to finally find out what the \\"secret\\" Bud has been carrying around is. And the secret, when we understand it, is squalid, sad, and deeply uninteresting. <br /> <br />I hope you get some idea of the movie now before you run out to see it because you want to see two semi-well-known personalities engage in a sex act.  This curiosity factor aside, there is no GOOD reason to see the film.  It would only be to see for yourself just how bad a movie made by someone who actually knows how to make films can be. <br /> <br />Don't believe the reviewers who say their ten year old brothers could do the same.  It takes a REAL ego to actually make some of the stuff that's on this film.  There's a scene with a truly sad looking Cheryl Tiegs that nearly made me want to weep for her, because she is so dreadfully abused as a performer.  Her part mostly consists of looking sad and then kissing Vincent Gallo for minutes on end because apparently he's just so darn irresistible.  Don't believe the people who claim the film is saying something about male relationships with women and that it is some expose of how men really feel.  It is simply a movie about a guy who is sad and feeling guilty and having a hard time dealing with it.  Rather than tell us his story (except in the last 10 minutes) or reveal something about grief and how it can affect others, it simply shows how a person who is sad would actually look sad and move in a slow manner to suggest sadness.   <br /> <br />It also shows a lot of boring countryside through a bug-splattered van window.  Minute after endless minute of that. <br /> <br />And Gallo himself is supremely annoying.  He has a singularly unappealing, whiny voice.  In an early scene, he is exhorting a convenience store clerk to go with him to California.  The dialogue is:  \\"Go with me to California.\\"  Pause \\"Please.\\"  Pause  \\"Please.\\"  Pause \\"Please Go With me!\\"  He says this while staring intensely at her...so naturally she agrees to immediately throw away her life to leave with this complete stranger.  And the great thing is this...his voice sounds like Alvin Chipmunk whispering.  Imagine yourself throwing your life away for that!!! <br /> <br />I hate this movie.  Chances are very, very good that you will too.  I've tried to warn you. <br />
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Season 3 was when Enterprise got Great.I did enjoy the first 2 seasons but alot of episodes where similar to episodes done in past Trek series.Ratings was real low so they had to do something enter The Xindi.Season 3 is all about Enterprise going after The Xindi to stop there plans of wipeing out Earth for good.I loved how season 3 ended.Season 4 was also alot of fun.It's to bad the show got cancel.But at least we can enjoy this short lived show on DVD.It's nice to know after season 4 is released that the whole saga of Star Trek is on DVD-The Orginal series,TNG,DS9,Voyager,and Enterprise,plus the 10 movies,WOW thats alot of Trek to own!All we need now on DVD is The Cartoon series,and Hopefully that will be out soon?
B000ASATWQ|5.0|All I can say is that Bob would be very proud to hear that his love for music has been carried on through his bloodlines like purebred AKC Champion German Shepards. This album is hot...REAL HOT. The track with Nas is off the chain I must add. Go get this if you dont have it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese is Basil Fawlty, a hotel manager trying to please only those who have a lot of money or fame. He is dominated by his overbearing wife & has an inept waiter to deal with. (He's from Barcelona) The only brains in the whole outfit is Polly. 12 episodes of hilarity. Watch the sign outside the hotel. Something always happens to it.
B000002H33|4.0|Metallica's 3rd album Master of Puppets got out in 1986. It's just another great metallica album, while not my favorite (in fact, not even my 2nd favorite; Ride and Justice beat this IMO) it's still very good.    OK, so Kirk Hammett may not be the best guitarist ever but he still did here a decent work. And there is really no problems with the guitars. Although when comparing the musicianship to this of Kill, Ride or Justice it's pretty average. This is by far the lightest of the first 4 Metallica albums. But it's still cool. 'Battery' is an awesome opener. The title track is IMO overrated but it's still great. 'The Thing That Should Not Be' is severely underrated. It has a very creepy mood and solo. 'Sanitarium' is another great ballad (although I prefer Fade and One to this). Then comes my favorite song, 'Disposable Heroes'. It is one monster track. Very heavy with anti-war lyrics. The best solo from the album. And it doesn't lose it's heavy edges in the whole 8 mins it takes. Also the basslines are awesome. 'Leper Messiah' is maybe somewhat simple, but it's still fun. Personally I don't really care for the last 2 tracks. Despite that Orion has a great bass solo from Cliff (RIP) it really drags out. 'Damage Inc' is by far the worst song on the album. Maybe this is the reason why it is 4 stars and not 5.     Overall, maybe overrated, but still good. If you're new it's a fine place to start. Make sure you also have Ride the Lightning, And Justice for All, and Live Sh it. But don't bother with anything after Live Sh it (1993).
B00079FUI6|5.0|The reason why I mentioned I'm a guy is that a lot of times sitcoms are geared towards certain audiences. For example, 2004's other breakout show Lost, everyone would think that it's just men who watch that and women who watch this. Well it's a very fascinating show so it doesn't matter who it is, it's still entertaining. <br /> <br />The show largely centers around 4 women: Susan(Teri Hatcher), a single lovable klutsy single mom raising a teenage daughter. Bree(Marcia Cross), the wasp-like republican conservative wife married with 2 kids. Lynette(Felicity Huffman) was a career woman until she got pregnant, now she's raising 4 kids with a husband at work. Gabrielle(Eva Longoria) is a wealthy materalistic wife who's just unhappy with the marriage part. <br /> <br />One thing that makes the main 4 great is that each one does questionable things but you still care for them and even sympathize. Susan asks her daughter to break into a neighbour's house to steal evidence of a rather serious crime. Bree ratted out her own son since he's being rather non-chalant of something he did. Lynette yells at her kids and sticks her nose where it doesn't belong which tends to cause trouble. And Eva is materalistic of course but she is having an affair with her gardener, who's underage no less. Yet each one in their own weird way is justified. <br /> <br />One problem I had with shows like Frasier or Friends is that only episodes now and then deal with any \\"plot points\\". Meaning like Ross breaking up/reconciling with Rachel(of one of many times) or Niles finding getting Daphne. In daytime soaps it's so overwrought and cliche that it's hard to get into it when it's so repetitive. Example: how many times have you seen 2 characters in a conversation than the other just turns their back on them for a part of it? Just talk face to face damnit. Desperate Housewives takes the best parts of the soap operas(the interesting storylines and twists), takes out the worse parts(the overdoneness), and combines it with the more sophisticated primetime feel without that cheesiness that soaps have. <br /> <br />Each actor is also great in their parts. The one that actually surprised me was Teri Hatcher. Prior to this show, how many people ONLY knew her by Lois Lane from the Superman show with Dean Cain? Well add this too. She's really great at physical comedy as well which is really surprising. She can turn on the dramatics so well than do a comedic scene right afterwards, like the pool scene later in the show. Also Eva is good as well playing that seductress siren like woman which shows that even really gorgeous women can act. <br /> <br />The DVD's are also better designed than season sets like say Smallville where all the special features are right at the end of the last disc. Here they're spread out so you have one disc that has an interview with creator Marc Cherry by Meredith Viera of the View and Millionaire then another disc will have a feature on the clothing and sets. Although I must say I really hate Oprah who's became basically her own parody so having a special with her is just ugh. And the commentaries are kind of unplentiful. Some episodes that would've been nice to get a commentary don't get one. <br /> <br />Sure the cast is largely dominated by women but it doesn't mean that it isn't a show that only a certain group can watch. I may hate womanly shows like Sex and the City but a womanly one like this is also great too.
B000002JS6|5.0|This review is for you young rockers out there. <br /> <br />Here I am shopping on Amazon.com for albums and I stumble across some reviews of Back In Black. To my amazement, there were actually people who trashed the band and the album. Wow. Unbelievable. <br /> <br />Actual sales worldwide are hard to track, so charts will vary from one organization to another. However, every leading music organization lists Back In Black as being one of the best selling albums of all time for ANY genre of music. You don't just sell 19 Million copies of an album over a period of 24 years as a fluke. This album IS one of the best ever, period. <br /> <br />Critics of AC/DC like to bash the band for their simple song structure and basic chord patterns. I have two comments about that. First of all, lead guitarist Angus Young himself described AC/DC as a heavy blues band. By its nature blues music tends to be more emotional and passionate than technically advanced. Do those same critics have the nerve to criticize BB King for playing different songs in the same key? You know the answer to that.  <br /> <br />Secondly, I've been a musician for years and have heard countless garage bands bash AC/DC for playing \\"three-fingered, ape music.\\" Yet, when that same band covers an AC/DC tune they may play it correct technically, but they are flat our boring. Why? Because, just like those critics, they only HEAR the music; they are incapable of FEELING it.  <br /> <br />AC/DC is all about feel. Their music is powerful, driving, and energetic because they found that magic formula for making the listener experience that same passion they poured into the creation of the music.  <br /> <br />This album was the first recorded after the death of the original lead singer, Bon Scott. Bon was like a brother, and his passing was no small loss. Even today some band members refuse to talk about it. As time passed the rest of the band came to realize that Bon would have wanted them to go on. With the blessingof Bon's mother, the band re-grouped, found a new vocalist, and put their heart and soul into Back In Black, their loving tribute to their fallen brother. And every time you put this CD into your deck, their inspired passion comes oozing out of the speakers and into your very being. That is why Back In Black is the band's best album to date, and one of the best albums ever.  <br /> <br />Those who pan AC/DC or Back In Black probably fall into one of three categories: 1) People who are turned off by commercial success 2) People who are incapable of feeling the passion exuded by the music in this album, 3) People who are flaming idiots. <br /> <br />I say this review is for the younger rockers because we old dogs already own the album and just laugh at those who trash it.  <br /> <br />This is the best selling Hard Rock / Heavy Metal album of all time for a reason: It is excellent. <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|One explosive cd, and one mellow beautiful one, put together in the same package.  <br />This has proven to be the foo fighter's most unique album yet,  <br />with songs such as \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"DOA\\", \\"Another Round\\", \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\", and many more. <br /> <br />The Explosive Side: <br />(track by track breakdown) <br /> <br />In Your Honor - What a way to start off an album. In Your Honor is by far the most unique song on the electric side. Hard Rock Man! <br /> <br />No Way Back - Well done guitar, as always of course, No Way Back <br />has a kick to it that you cant find in the other songs! <br /> <br />Best Of You - By far the most emotional song on the electric cd. Full of davey's good ole' fashioned screaming. (You know, the not creepy kind.) The Video for this song is amazing! Full of life. <br /> <br />DOA - My personal favorite song on the electric side. Classic Foo Fighters.  <br /> <br />Hell - A little more generic. Although the lyrics are great! <br /> <br />The Last Song - This one is great, because everything flows so naturally. You can listen to it over and over and never grow tired of it! <br /> <br />Free Me - This is a reasonable song. Not one of my favorites, although definatly worth a listen. <br /> <br />Resolve - The best vocals on this cd. Period. <br /> <br />The Deepest Blues Are Black - A song about depression, and coming out of it. Almost as emotional as \\"Best Of You\\". <br /> <br />End Over End - This is my other favorite on this cd. \\"End Over End\\" has great lyrics, masterful guitar, and is not too heavy but not too light.  <br /> <br /> <br />The Mellow Side: <br /> <br />Still - Honestly, this song makes me think of flying. (Not on a plane!) <br /> <br />What If I Do? - A little bit of a jazzy song. Definatly worth listening to. <br /> <br />Miracle - This one sounds like the Foo Fighters. I mean that the electric and acoustic sound different, but this is sort of a cross. Brilliant! <br /> <br />Another Round - Love the guitar onthis song, and the lyrics perfectly put across the message. <br /> <br />Friend Of A Friend - Written by Dave Grohl about 10 years ago, friend of a friend is about when he moves to seattle to live with Kurt and Kirst. A decent song. <br /> <br />Over and Out - Good lyrics, it's a little bit of an emotional song. <br /> <br />On The Mend - Different than the others, you get a different feeling. You'll understand when you hear it. <br /> <br />Virginia Moon - A Jazzy song. B-E-A-UTIFUL.  <br /> <br />Cold Day In The Sun - Written by Taylor Hawkins (Drummer). Has a summery feel to it.  <br /> <br />Razor - Not one of my favorites, but still a good song. <br /> <br /> <br />Thats all of them! <br />Well, what are you waiting for? <br />Go buy it!
B000089HCR|4.0|I'm writing due to a bad review by another person. Most of the reviews for this album are 4-5 stars, but one individual gave them two stars because \\"it's hard to tell if they are taking themselves seriously or if the whole thing is a big joke.\\" He continued to lump WASP in with the bands from the 80's as a whole saying \\"Fans of eighties metal like Motley Crue and Ratt may find something of interest here, but bands like this were a dime a dozen in the eighties and most created music far superior to this.\\" <br /> <br />Wow. This guy is way off the mark. I was around in the 80's, and I was (and still am) into much of the rock/metal from that era. I feel it is my duty to set the record straight. <br /> <br />Do they take thelmselves seriously? Yes and no. WASP's leader, Blackie Lawless, is a very intelligent, well-spoken person. He knows reality from fiction. The outlandish costumes, obnoxious lyrics, and over-the-top stage persona are not to be taken seriously. But their dedication to their fans and their intense, roaring, screaming brand of metal comes straight from the heart.  <br /> <br />Fans of the 90's grunge sound do not realize that at one time Rock Stars and their bands were bigger than life. They were charismatic, confident icons who captivated legions of fans with live shows that were closer to a circus than a mere musical performance. Their songs were a vehicle to escape the BS we must deal with in the real world. THAT is WASP! <br /> <br />Those 90's grunge bands think they should be taken seriously because they whine, moan and complain about the pain and anxiety in today's world? HA! They are so depressing they make me want to slit my wrists. They say \\"Our live shows are all about the music, not the flash\\", so they go onstage in T-shirts and jeans and have no fireworks, effects, or anything. What a rip-off. I've been to many shows by many of today's leading rock bands and left feeling like I was ripped off. The laugh at the pics and video's from the 80'smetal bands and say \\"It was all about the look...they didn't even care about the music.\\" WHATEVER! For us fans the music was ALWAYS the main attraction to the band. WASP is still releasing albums and touring after 20 years. If the music was weak they would have faded years ago.    <br /> <br />WASP started in the 80's, but trust me...the average Bon Jovi fan did not listen to them. WASP is obnoxious, in-you-face, loud, screaming, crank-it-up, party-till-you-puke, no-frills Heavy Metal, and this album is one of their best. <br /> <br />If you are depressed, hate life, hate the world, and constantly feel like blowing your brains out I would recommend Nirvana, Pearl Jam and a good psychiatrist. If you are an arrogant snob who feels that intelligent people only listen to songs that tackle the social issues of the day I would recommend REM and a good dose of reality. Conversely, if your idea of dealing with today's world is throwing a finger in the air an screaming, \\"Bring It On!\\", then this album is for you.\\"
B00005ASHM|5.0|You don't need a rocket scientist to inform you that The Beach Boys' 1966 album \\"Pet Sounds\\" is one of the Top 10 greatest albums ever made. Not much is left to say that hasn't already been said about the album. Song for song, the record is pure perfection. From the youthful abandonment of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" to the dramatism present on \\"Sloop John B.\\" to the heartugging \\"God Only Knows\\" (voted the greatest love song of all time) to the poignancy of \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\" to the chilling \\"Caroline No\\", there is not one clunker on the whole cd.<br /><br />This newly remastered edition features the entire album in both stereo and mono. In both forms, the album sounds absolutely fantastic. There ies also an excellent booklet filled with some great essays and rare pcitures. Definitey a must have album.
B000002H97|4.0|This is Metallica's highly acclaimed masterpiece but I tend to disagree.While the production absolutely rocks-there is no other word for it-some of the songs leave something to be desired.This album paves the way for the new Metallica of the 90's and in style.'Enter Sandman' a slightly overrated song, gives perhaps a wrong impression of the songs to follow.Its hard,driving riff and jackhammer beats make you feel as if it's '..and Justice For All' but Metallica has got the sound right,but ballads like 'Nothing Else Matters' could not be more different from this album's predecessor's style.Don't get me wrong,I'm not the typical Load-Reload basher and sure, I like Metallica ballads but I'm just trying to say how different Metallica has become.Some of the underrated solos on this album are simply great and for the first time Jason can be heard.My only problems with this album are- <br />1)Where's the instrumental that we had come to love? <br />2)Complex song structures?They could have included atleast one! <br />All in all a great album but not up to the level of its predecessors.
B00008OWZC|5.0|\\"How The West Was Won\\" is Led Zeppelin at their best: raw, uninhibited and ready to tare the house down. From the opening \\"L.A. Drone\\" to the last few strains of \\"Bring It On Home\\", this is Led Zeppelin the way they were meant to be heard. Songs like \\"The Immigrant Song\\", \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" sound better than the studio version. The 19 minute version of the John Bonham centerpiece \\"Moby Dick\\" is astonishing. And while seem fans might be turned away by the unseemly long versions of \\"Dazed And Confused\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", don't worry. They go by fast thanks to the energy and originallity injected in them.<br /><br />The bottom line is simple: \\"How The West Was Won\\" belongs in anyone's record collection, Led Zeppelin fan or not. Nobody's collection is complete without it.
B00000J9HF|5.0|Verdi based this opera on a play, \\"Le roi s'amuse\\" by Victor Hugo.  It is hard to understand today, but Hugo's play ran into trouble with the censor's because of the scandalous way it presented royalty and was shut down after a single performance.  In fact, Hugo had based his characters on real historical figures: King Francois I (ruled 1515 - 1547) (the Duke of Mantua in the opera) and his jester, Triboulet (who becomes Rigoletto).  In the play, the king is a letch and rapes his jester's fifteen-year-old daughter, Blanche.  Hugo makes Triboulet a hunchback and this makes historical sense.  Verdi retains this in the opera and Rigoletto is also a hunchback.  In the days of Francois I, physical deformities were sources of public humor and ridicule.<br /><br />In making cuts to the five-act play for the opera, Verdi and his librettist also changed some names, but they did use some dialogue directly from the play including the words to this opera's famous aria \\"La donna &egrave; mobile\\".  However, there are also real differences because operas are different things than plays.<br /><br />The opera opens at the Duke's palace where he is holding a festive ball and bragging to one of his buddies about his latest amorous conquest.  He has a long track record of seducing unmarried women as well as other men's wives and this creates many hard feelings.  He declares that others may feel the need for fidelity, but it isn't for him.  He tells Borsa about a young girl who lives in an alley that he has met at church.  She does not know who he is.  The Duke has also heard that she is visited every evening by an unknown man.<br /><br />As the Duke makes a very public and humiliating advance on the Countess Ceprano in front of her husband, Rigoletto enters and mocks the husband.  One of the courtiers tells the others that he has discovered that Rigoletto has a mistress he visits in the evenings.  During all this Count Monterone enters and is furious with the Duke for having dishonored his daughter.  Rigoletto mimics and insults the old man, who swears vengeance and curses the Duke and Rigoletto.  The others turn on the old man for killing the fun of the party.<br /><br />As Rigoletto returns to his home down an alley near Count Ceprano's house he is approached by Sparafucile who is an assassin and offers his services to Rigoletto.  The murderer explains how he works his trade with the help of his sister, Maddalena.  Rigoletto says he has no need of his services, but later begins thinking about it because of all the humiliations he has had to suffer because of his deformities and his status as a servant to a wealthy and powerful man.  He enters his home lost in thought and is greeted by his daughter Gilda (pronounced jilda).  She knows nothing of Rigoletto's life or even her own.  Her father's love and attention, the housekeeper Giovanna, and attending Church are the scope of her world.<br /><br />The Duke as already entered the house unnoticed through a bribe he has paid Giovanna.  Gilda believes her love, the Duke, is just a student without money.  After Rigoletto leaves, the Duke surprises Gilda and they exchange declarations of passion and love.  They here Ceprano and others coming down the alley so the Duke leaves.<br /><br />Ceprano and the others are there to kidnap Rigoletto's mistress.  Rigoletto enters and believes that they are kidnapping Countess Ceprano and even holds the ladder for them.  This delights those who want their revenge on Rigoletto.  As they drag Gilda away, it dawns on Rigoletto what has actually happened and he remembers the curse.<br /><br />The second act returns to the Duke's palace.  The Duke is in despair that Gilda has been kidnapped and is surprised at his genuine affection for her.  As the men brag and present Rigoletto's mistress to the Duke, he and Gilda rush to each other.  Rigoletto appears and is looking for his daughter, when he learns she is with the Duke he tries to break in and demands her, turned away, he begs.  Gilda is brought to him and confesses that her love affair with the Duke has cost her her honor.  As Malderone is led past he notices a portrait of the Duke admitting that his curse has done nothing.  Rigoletto swears vengeance on the Duke even while Gilda pleads for Mercy.<br /><br />As the third act opens, Rigoletto has hired Sparafucile to kill the Duke and what follows is a tragedy for all involved.  This is the act with the famous melody \\"La donna &egrave; mobile\\".  It is the Duke's signature drinking song and note how it is used at different times in this act.  It ranges from a rather pleasant song with an appropriately banal accompaniment through a delusional horror song.  Magically done!<br /><br />This opera was first performed in 1851 and was soon followed by \\"La Traviatta\\" and \\"Il Trovatore\\".  What a great couple of years for opera!  This great opera has many wonderful features that add so much to the work.  For example, when Rigoletto and Sparafucile first meet, they are accompanied without violins to give it a strange sound and a lower, more sinister register.  Note, too, that the chorus in this opera is only men (and what great music Verdi gives them to sing!).  Verdi also set out to do an opera with few arias.  He wanted this to be an opera of duets and they are here in beautiful abundance as are some amazing ensemble singing.<br /><br />Treat yourself to this magnificent opera with this very fine recording.

B0006J28KU|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have seen.  The acting and the story line is awesome.<br /><br />Don't pass by this movie.  You will regret it.
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|I remember back in 2000 when rumours were going round that a 4 hour version of \\"Titanic\\" with all the deleted scenes intact was going to be released by Christmas of that year....I was so excited and it never eventuated. I only wish we were given the option to watch the full movie and the alternate ending like they did with \\"Stigmata\\".....We've all seen the documentaries of how the film was made so why double up? <br />I am only getting the 2 disc version only for the fact that it has DTS sound and now that I have my movie entertainment projector I can watch it on my wall in the living room large as life and not on a small TV screen which makes viewing this film intolerable
B0000CEB4V|5.0|To tell you the truth, I skipped the Indian music and went straight to the concert.  Awesome musicians, great sound and camerawork - very well done.   While My Guitar Gently weeps obviously was among the highlights with Claptons soaring guitar, but there were many others, including Sam Brown and Jools Holland doing Horse to Water.  I honestly had never heard of this song OR Sam Brown but I hit the repeat button three times on this one.  I did some research on her and subsequently bought a Jools Holland album where she sings a song \\"Together We Are Strong\\", another great soulful vocal performance.    <br />Was great to see Ringo and Paul on the same stage.  Ringo is so engaging and warm during Photograph, it was very touching.
0399143904|5.0|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is about a commando team called Rainbow Six that fights terrorism.  The military style reconnoissance, the perfect coordination of the Rainbow team, and likable and realistic characters made this book the best at what it is: a commando thriller with all of the necessary background needed to understand the story.
B000AA305M|1.0|This CD employs a copy protection method that disallows transfer of tracks to your iPod. If you can't play the tunes on your player of choice, what good is the music? <br />I'd rate this ZERO stars if I could...
B00009V7T2|3.0|While _Frances The Mute_ has put The Mars Volta on the map, it is this, their full-length debut, that is their finest work so far.  The mindless meandering present on _Frances_ is gone here; producer Rick Rubin successfully tamed the band, and the result is a much more focused album.  It isn't the prog rock masterpiece of the 21st century (right now that title belongs to Porcupine Tree's _In Absentia_), but it's a strong debut that shows that the band might not be a joke after all.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|When I heard Little sister and In My Head, I had my doubts.

0800177177|2.0|Here we have a movie that had a lot of potential. It's a faithful adaptation of Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" with a very good budget to support some great special effects. With Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, and singer Tom Waits, how could you lose?<br /><br />The horror in this film isn't so much from the story as it is in the acting of the two leads. Had the casting been different, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" might have turned out to be a pretty good movie. But with Winona Ryder as Mina, and Keannu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, there are big problems. Displaying only a fraction of the acting ability of your average junior high drama club, these two really spoiled what could have been a really good movie.<br /><br />From Winona's attempt at a British accent (that often turns southern), to Keannu's patented wooden acting and powdered-sugar hair, it quickly becomes a truly gut wrenching viewing experience.<br /><br />However, the movie is saved by some very good special effects, Gary Oldman's acting, a good portrayal of Van Helsing by Anthony Hopkins, and solid performances by Cary Elwes, Sadie Frost, and Bill Campbell. Each play their part very well, with Frost's vampire Lucy looking especially creepy.<br /><br />But with Winona and Keannu sucking the life out of each scene they're in, it only ranks as a 2 1/2 star film.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Yeah,yeah,green day pretty much destroyed Punk,bringing in the punk pop crap to the table. But, in my oppinion, green day is not a punk band.The sound is more like a genre called alternative & Punk, And this album is very alternative.Green day evolved from being a lame ass Pop/rock band to being a Sub-par pop punk band to being a strange alternative band, and this album shows it.The songs are catchy,the production is good,and the sound is different.Green day is the best alternative punk band around, and this is a fantastic album,if you like an alternative sound,which i kinda do.
B00005221M|2.0|I give it a two stars instead of just 1 because the movie itself is enjoyable. However, it seriously misses on the original dialogue (.ie. there is original dialogue missing during the argument between Duncan and Hawkeye inside the forth.)  <br /> <br />Also, the original movie had beautiful music that is missing in the DVD version (.ie. Clanad's \\"I will find you\\" musical background is missing in the scene where the heroes climb the mountains following Magua's war party and the Munro's daugthers.) <br /> <br />It felt like a cheeseburger without the cheese and with fried tofu for meat. I strongly recommend the movie itself, but I don't recommend this particular DVD version of it.
0671027387|4.0|Could not put this book down.  Technological info was impressive. Altho I did not totally understand the scientific explanations, I was totally into the politics.  Very fast paced and kept me guessing who The Controller was!! Scary!!<br /><br />Nice heroine, nice hero. One roller coaster ride and a sweet ending.  The country and politics go on!!!  It would make one heck of a movie!!
B000AL730O|5.0|For starters, I'm not a big Paul McCartney fan at all. The only offerings from his solo stuff I really liked was the 'Back In The USA' live cd set a few years ago, and that's because: #1, It's mostly his classic Beatles songs, and #2, I saw a similar show on that tour.<br /><br />That being said, a friend lent me the new CD, and overall, I was very surprised and impressed with most of what I heard.<br /><br />I give the guy alot of credit for finally making a record where he took the song writing seriously, and it shows thru out. The fact that there are no 'rockers' on it doesn't bother me at all. What I'm most impressed with is that he finally made a record with songs that mean something to him, and not worry about the public's or critic's expectations.<br /><br />Good for him. I find all the songs, the arrangements, instrumentation, lyrics, and singing to be of the quality he did with that first band he was in.<br /><br />It's like he finally made the album he should have made 3 decades ago. This one resonates with me a billion times more than the catchy 'pop' he can churn out in his sleep.<br /><br />Yeah, I guess I like it alot more than I expected I would. Most songs remind me of his 'For Now One'/'BlackBird'/'Martha My Dear' style of writing. Good stuff.<br /><br />If I find much to like, I'd expect real Paul enthusiasts to get a real kick out of it too.
B0002KQNJU|1.0|I'm stunned, STUNNED, at all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this film.  Watching it, I found it to be beautiful and atmospheric in its sets and cinematography.  It is a shame it wasn't a full on horror film, ala Hammer Films.  The two younger women in the film are nice to look at, Sharon Tate especially.  However, this film is supposed to be a comedy, and it is painfully unfunny.  One mild chuckle at best, and now I am hard pressed to remember what that was for.  Looking for some reassurance of my opinion, and finding little here, I read Roger Ebert's original 1968 review for the film at [...]  The review is funnier than the film, and it's not one of Ebert's funnier reviews.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|The George Harrison-led \\"Concert for Bangladesh\\" will make its DVD debut Oct. 25 via Rhino, the same day Capitol releases a remixed, remastered CD of the project. Rhino is also creating a deluxe edition set with a reproduction of Harrison's handwritten lyrics for the then-new song \\"Bangla Desh,\\" a postcard set, a sticker and a print of the original show poster.<br /><br />Staged on Aug. 1, 1971, at New York's Madison Square Garden, the show raised funds via UNICEF for Bangladeshi refugees caught in the middle of the country's battle for independence from Pakistan.<br /><br />It featured Harrison performing alongside Bob Dylan (making a rare public appearance in the wake of a serious motorcycle accident), Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Ravi Shankar, Billy Preston, Badfinger and Leon Russell. The event was chronicled the following year on a triple-LP set and a feature film.<br /><br />Rhino's DVD restores the original 99-minute movie in 5.1 sound and tacks on a wealth of extras, including a rehearsal performance of \\"If Not for You\\" with Harrison and Dylan and a soundcheck take on \\"Come on in My Kitchen\\" with Harrison, Clapton and Russell, plus Dylan performing \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit,\\" an outtake from the theatrical release.<br /><br />The DVD will also include a 45-minute documentary, \\"The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited 2005,\\" which features interviews with Bob Geldof and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.<br /><br />Here is the track list for \\"The Concert for Bangladesh\\":<br /><br />\\"Bangla Dhun\\"<br />\\"Wah-Wah\\"<br />\\"My Sweet Lord\\"<br />\\"Awaiting on You All\\"<br />\\"That's the Way God Planned It\\"<br />\\"It Don't Come Easy\\"<br />\\"Beware of Darkness\\"<br />Band Introduction<br />\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"<br />\\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\"<br />\\"Youngblood\\"<br />\\"Here Comes the Sun\\"<br />\\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\"<br />\\"It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train To Cry\\"<br />\\"Blowin' in the Wind\\"<br />\\"Just Like a Woman\\"<br />\\"Something\\"<br />\\"Bangla Desh\\"
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Unfortunately I have to agree with all the other reviewers have had to say. I have been an Eric fan since the start, I even went to see the graffiti (you know the one!). This is not the worst Eric Cd but only because I can't bring myself to making it his worst. Like others I'm glad he's happy at last but this purile stuff is not what the fans want, I really do want to hear the Strat scream just one more time. Please \\"God\\" let the Albert Hall recordings do the job.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Bob Dylan was a American kid with a brilliant mind, and nothing to lose. In this beautifully edited film, with awesome, never seen before, vintage footage, Scorsese certainly tells us lots about Bob Dylan, but mostly it is the bigger picture, about  what it means to be an artist, about traveling the unmarked territory that is the artist's map. The times were ripe in 1966 when Scorcese begins this film, for a Bob Dylan. But it was Bob Dylan who was paying attention. Not only does Scorsese show the passion and energy (and ego indeed) that drove Bob Dylan to absorb, find, meet,  everyone of the time, who were valued, incidentally, if they \\"had something to say\\" more than all else, but the film shows how determined Dylan was to protect his oeuvre, by showing how often he would simply refuse to be pigeonholed, or even to answer questions, in interviews. As Picasso said, \\" we do not ask to understand the song of a bird.\\" This is just amazing, that Scorcese shows us this bigger picture; how art gets made, and how challenging it is to stay authentic. I am a visual artist, and was really not an avid Dylan devotee before I saw this, but his brilliant mind,  irresistable authenticity, even charm, has made a fan of me. The segments of actual interviews with, now older, Dylan are beautifully lit, and reveal a wise and soulful man. One of my favorite quotes, that makes me laugh, was \\"You can't be wise and in love at the same time\\"... This film makes America look good, too, like we are original thinkers who care about more than simply commerce. Scorsese has made a brilliant, important film.
B000060MWU|5.0|Wrong term to use. only cause I can't just the word bullsh*t stress enough how much it annoys me that people write VERY DETAILED REVIEWS about the crappy DVD format that they shelled out very little cash for. I got this for 6 bucks and it's good enough. I do think that whatever company should restore it, but people are still bitches. <br /> <br />oh yeah the movies great I have next to nothing to say about that though cause i'm a nitpicking bitch!!! See what you made me do DVD-obsessives? Chill out and watch the movie.
0800130227|5.0|Just as Stephen King knows what scares you, \\"Matilda\\" is completely and totally in touch with what it is and was like to be a kid. Grownups will have no problem remembering when teachers were ogres, and parents were from another planet. Kids will love the revenge factor as the heroine gets a lot more than even. <br /> <br />I see a positive message here for all ages in always believing in yourself, even if no one else does. The movie's pace ensures that youngsters will stay focused. The acting keeps adults interested.  <br /> <br />A great movie to watch with a child, or by yourself. Go outside when it is over. The sky is a little bluer, the sun a little brighter, and the air smells wonderful!
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Buddy Guy's latest is fantastic! He translates his heartbreak,struggles and joy... in a very real way. The duet's with Tracy Chapman, Carlos Santanta and John Mayer were especially a treat. Well worth every penny, a must have to any Buddy Guy collection.
0975991477|2.0|I would have appreciated, as a psychotherapist and life coach, a sound and thorough scientific review of how Dr. Lipton reached his conclusions. <br /> <br />Instead, I heard an awful lot about the Caribbean and what sounded suspiciously like a man pretending to come down to \\"my level\\" in order to ingratiate himself to me, as his reader.  Hmm.  I pondered to myself, Why would he need to do that if I already bought the book?  What's he selling? <br /> <br />At the end of the book, Dr. Lipton contradicts everything he has already written in stone by claiming that the only way out of our self-limiting beliefs and assumptions is by raising our children to not have them.  He also claims that you, the reader, cannot do the same for yourself, because your subconscious is simply to big and powerful for you to take on as an adversary. <br /> <br />Tell me, Dr. Lipton--if YOU, as you claim, were able to overcome your self-limiting beliefs and assumptions as an adult, why can't I?  <br /> <br />And tell me, please, how exactly I am supposed to change myself just enough to raise my children differently, yet still remain one of the helpless, hopeless adults you've just made all of us out to be? <br /> <br />Dr. Lipton's book is a study in contradiction--you have the ultimate power over your own body!  You can change your body by changing your beliefs!  BUT, sadly, you are not powerful enough to change your beliefs, because you are an unknowing victim of your subconscious. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, all of this can be rectified by signing up for brainwashing a la PSYCH-K. <br /> <br />Dr. Lipton, it is persons such as yourself who give the professions of coaching and psychotherapy a bad, bad name. <br /> <br />I believe that Dr. Lipton's intentions were probably good, but something happened along the way...maybe his cells all rose up, handcuffed and gagged his brain (according to Dr. Lipton, our brains are unnecessary anyway), and then had a series of secret meetings with Mr. Rob Williams on how to convince nice, decent people that they are in fact totally incapable of meeting their own needs, and desperately require a system of spurious techniques to \\"fix\\" them. <br /> <br />Please... <br />
B000AP04EW|4.0|What is it with some directors and editors?  This had the makings of a great movie..  action, comedy, decent story and good characters... then with 10 minutes of the movie remaining, the director & producer went home and left the rest up to a fan of the A-Team. Both characters out in the open, 50000 bullets, outnumbered 20-1 and ... well, I really do not want to spoil the ending for you :)   I mean, come on ! ..  a 12 year old could have written a better finish.   <br /> <br />However, forgetting the ending for a moment, this was a good movie and I do recommend it.
B0007XT87G|5.0|One sure fire sign that you're becoming a fogey, fart, geezer is when you are amazed and astounded, thrilled and excited by a new band. Especially one that's been around for 13 years. Even the missus thought these wnaks were mighty.  <br />So having seen that Robert Fripp was opening for them at The Keswick in Glenside, I checked out their website and bought this on a whim. I shall forever trust my whims. Inheriting a spirit of independent creativity from the likes of Pink Floyd and having harmonic and melodic turns as impressive as Steve Hackett fired Genesis, and even a pop sensibilty contemporaneous with anything Gwyneth might bed, I'm impressed. Then to see them execute a slew of material from their catalogue with a finesse and passion most bands would give their I teeth for (and having Fripp open for you no less), I'm really quite committed. I don't know the words to all their songs (well \\"Radioactive Toy\\" was easy enough, but that's pretty lame stuff) like the chap next to my wife who wriggled in ecstacy at every opening bar, nonetheless, I was blown away. <br />What caught me about the CD was the song \\"Lazarus\\". In concert, it was a revelation, as were \\"Halo Around MY Head\\" and a few others I couldn't possibly name. It all came to an emotional highpoint with \\"Arriving Somewhere, But Not Here.\\" <br />In any case, what's on offer here is a very true teastament to how incredibly in command they are with their instruments, how tight they are as a band (the material sounds even better live), and what an imaginative songwriter and beautiful singer Steve Wilson is. <br />So, if yer as gobsmacked as I am about new (sic) bands, you'll find this an extraordinary introduction to PT. I am feverishly purchasing the rest of the catalogue and would certainly ercommnd the LIVE CDs from Rome and Warsaw. You'll be amazed. <br />They need to work on their video presentation, which at the Keswick was displayed on a small projection screen obscured by the drums and amps that looked like it was borrowed from my Mom. No doubt an accountant's decision....
B000A0GP4K|5.0|The only complaint I have is that because it is a documentary, I would've loved to have seen more complete performances. The Newport footage was taken from Murray Lerner's \\"Festival\\" movie (shot at 4 Newport Folk fests, including the infamous \\"Dylan goes electric\\" set), which should get the Criterion treatment and put all the performances from the shows he filmed out to the public, because a lot of the artists that performed the shows are no longer with us as well as artists who have very little film footage available. The footage included here looks stunning.  <br /> <br />Also, \\"Eat the Document\\" has yet to be released, the footage shown on the documentary also looks great (although Dylan chopped the master reel up supposedly), with the pre-Band Hawks backing Dylan, but \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" does remain intact for the extras.  <br /> <br />Keep in mind this isn't a definitive biography of Bob Dylan, but mostly surrounding the years when he was hailed as a voice of a generation and booed as a rock star sellout, with the footage from '66 being intersperced throughout the film, building up to Newport '65. What's amazing to me is how young he was when all of this was going on, and that when he hit big he was only 20.  <br /> <br />Scorsese (who had directed \\"The Last Waltz\\" and has made many documentaries as well as classic films) had said that growing up in NY, he only became familiar with Dylan when he did \\"go electric\\", so everything he did earlier he wasn't that familiar with.  <br /> <br />Seeing Dylan going from this goofy cherub to cantankerous pain in a short amount of time captures him in a way \\"Don't Look Back\\" only covers the latter, and the inane questions interviewers ask him only make it worse. Baez mentions Dylan's mood swings on stage during his \\"folk\\" phase, and Seeger's threats to cut the electric cord at Newport are elaborated on.  <br /> <br />Where \\"Don't Look Back\\" captures Dylan as being difficult and mean (\\"Eat the Document\\" footage shows himin an even worse light),and Albert Grossman is mentioned as being one of the reasons for Dylan's change, \\"No Direction Home\\" kind of shows how he got to that point.  <br /> <br />It was great to see interviews with Allen Ginsburg and Dave Van Ronk (who are no longer with us), as well as Pete Seeger, Maria Muldaur, Joan Baez and Suze Rotolo. I would've thought Robbie Robertson would've taken part in it (as he did in \\"Last Waltz\\" with Scorsese), but the Hawks' drummer (who had put out his own backstage footage on DVD) instead talks about it.  <br /> <br />But again, the best part of the film are the performances, a lot of which has rarely been seen outside of bootlegs, and some for the first time. 40-something years later, whether he had center stage as a folk artist or the leader of a rock band, he was a mesmerizing performer, unfortunately over the years he would rarely put on shows with the same level of energy and enthusiasm (except on the Band's 74 tour with Dylan and his resurgence in the 90s-00s to college crowds. Don't write him off yet!). The \\"Bootleg Series\\" 1964 and 1966 are excellent CDs of his concerts that are captured in the documentary, the CD sountrack to this film is also worth picking up. All his CD from his debut to \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" should already be in your collection as well as the scrapbook and \\"Chronicles\\".  <br /> <br />Even though this is a great film for future generations getting into Dylan can get into, keep in mind there's some strong language throughout the film. But as far as history goes, you see Dylan performing in DC and was there for the \\"I have a dream\\" speech Martin Luther King gave, the folk scene and the variety of artists that had used Dylan's songs (it's funny to see Bob with a young Sonny and Cher).  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great documentary that Dylan himself narrates (through interviews past and present) and as far as Scorsese goes, tells the story without trying to be too matter of fact or digging up intimate details (which I'm sure the Dylanologists will again be frustrated by). It's kind of long to watch it in one sitting, but 4 hours is needed to be able to fit it (unfortunately the performance footage is cut for the interviews).
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I was hesitant going into this because I wasn't really a fan of System of a Down before I heard BYOB. I am, however, very glad I did get this CD because it is packed with great tracks. SoaD has forsaken some of their standard screamy sound for a much smoother more melodic sensation and I am enjoying every minute of it. Revenga and Violent Pornography are my favorite tracks on the album, but they are certainly not the only good ones, not by a long shot. Cigaro is actually the only track that I dislike and I am ever so slowly warming up to it as well.
B0007GAERG|5.0|...because it is worthwhile. Before 2005, I had never voluntarily listened to Mariah Carey. But this album has alot of good tracks on it. 97% of them are catchy, well writen, produced and performed. <br />1.   It's Like That- The 1st single off the album. R&B/Hip Hop featuring Fatman Scoop. Good beat but the lyrics are a bit bizarre.  9/10 <br /> <br />2.   We Belong Together- 2nd single. Everyone should know this song since it spent 14 weeks at #1 in the US. Sweet lyrics, twisting vocals and an R&B beat make this song appealing. 10/10 <br /> <br />3.   Shake it off- Poppy third single. Catchy and one of the best on the album.  9/10 <br /> <br />4.   Mine Again- Strong vocally with soul influence. Good instrumental and sort of like the old version of Mariah.  9/10 <br /> <br />5.   Say Somethin'- Featuring Snoop Dogg. Adult lyrics and a smooth beat, this number produced by the Neptunes is not the strongest point of the album. Good sound but Mariah's voice is reminisent of Charmbracelet. Her voacal ability is not shown, but it's an ok song  8/10 <br /> <br />6.   Stay the Night- I don't get this song. I always skip it. I just sounds like  something is missing. Retro R&B, borderline pop, average beat. 7/10 <br /> <br />7.   Get Your Number- I hate this chorus. Jermaine Dupri sounds wrong.  The 'morse code' sound and the guitar doesn't fit. Mariah's vocals are good though and it does get better after a while.  6/10 <br /> <br />8.   One and Only- I love this song for some reason. The vocals are really smooth and the lyrics suit the tune, which makes it sound even. R&B. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />9.   Circles- Unadulterated classic Mariah. High and lows which showcase her voice. Not a huge ballad but it makes the cut.  8/10 <br /> <br />10.   Your Girl- An interestingly arranged song. The chorus is not that great because it just sounds like she got a bunch of people to scream it. R&B genre.  7/10 <br /> <br />11.  I Wish You Knew- This is a solid song. With pretty lyrics and it sound like it's recorded live , the communication with the audience makes it sound real. This is a nice ballad.  9/10   <br /> <br />12. To the Floor- Another track by the Neptunes. Better constructed and vocally than Say Somethin' , Nelly sings instead of raps. They sound good together except the repeated \\"to the floor\\" doesn't sound great.  <br />8/10 <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride- Good chorus and pretty vocals. Beautiful lyrics and well sung, this song is one of the better performed songs on the album.  <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />14.  Fly Like a Bird- Great gospel sound and good beginning vocals. As soon as the choir kicks in it goes downhill. They sound bad.  7/10
B000683VI4|5.0|One of the most romantic movies I have ever seen.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It talks about the enduring nature of love and the roads that sometimes lead us away from (or to) our destinies. My husband sat in front of it virtually kicking and screaming, but by the end, he had to admit that he really enjoyed it, and I even think I saw him misting up at points.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I didn't own any of Mariah Carey's music until \\"...Mimi\\". Everyone who is considering buying it should, because it is not a waste of money. It mixes R&B, pop, hip hop and Mariah's classic ballads into one of her best albums so far. Mariah is not unintelligent and I'm sure she understands that she has made mistakes in the past concerning her music (\\"Charmbracelet\\" and \\"Glitter\\") but this a genuinely good effort of hers. Most people who come to critise her have probaly not even bought this album, so there judgement (which I don't know why they waste their time on) cannot not really be considered relevent.   To this date Mariah Carey has had 16 #1 US singles. In her 15 Year career she has sold over 180 million albums worldwide, her best selling \\"Music Box\\" hs sold 30 million alone. Mariah is someone who writes, produces and composes most of her music, unlike many artists. In my mind one this is of her better efforts and people who don't consider how tough it is to release something to follow up two major failures is not thinking. \\" Mainestream's Worst Enemy\\"... I am sorry to say this but your reviews don't make alot of sense. And, your right, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" did not sell 6 million or 9 million, it's sold 7 million worldwide. But...if you do consider sale anything to go by, Nox Arcana's (who are they again?) albums did not sell anywhere near as much. If you hate Mariah Carey (and always have) just don't bother buying her music. Don't waste your time. Go to some karaoke party with \\"Mainestream's Worst Enemy\\" instead.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Let's get this out of the way. Yes, Panic! At The Disco sounds strikingly similar to Fall Out Boy. This in no way takes away from the quality of these extremely catchy songs (much unlike An Angle's blatant ripoff of Bright Eyes' style, for example). The only downside to the album is the sometimes awkward synth parts, but they don't draw much attention to themselves and do little harm to the overall presence of \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\". It definitely isn't anything new or innovative, but if you're looking for a good pop record with some catchy hooks and pretty good songwriting, this album would probably be your best bet.
0060254920|5.0|This is a classic that needs to be passed on to your little one.  My husband gave this to our daughter on her first birthday and a year later they are still reading it.  She enjoys the \\"monster\\"  book, which is what she calls it.  This is a special book from our childhood that we enjoy sharing with our own child.
0452282152|3.0|The book did not hold my interest.  I enjoyed the view into the protestant - Catholic separation as well as a master -  servant relationship but I found the pace of the book slow.
B0000C8AVE|4.0|Ziggerman has allot to say. If it's political or just stories he insists on you hearing it, and you'll make it out perfectly with this acoustic/harmonica only record. As always Dylan's lyrics siphon into your mind and consciousness. Screams, groans, muttering, laughing, talking, and just plain folk singing are what he uses to express every emotion Dylan is capable of. Melancholy songs of heartbreak like 'Don't think twice...' are cluttered with insightful paraphrases like \\"I give her my heart but she wanted my soul\\" and \\"But goodbye's too good a word, gal - So I'll just say fare thee well\\". While the comical 'Talking WW3 blues' Dylan says in a sarcastic manner \\"Some time ago a crazy dream came to me, I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three - I went to the doctor the very next day to see what kinda words he could say -  He said it was a bad dream\\".  The third song of the album a much more ill-tempered Dylan in a sulky manner growls \\"And I hope that you die - And your death'll come soon - I will follow your casket - In the pale afternoon - And I'll watch while you're lowered - Down to your deathbed - And I'll stand o'er your grave - 'Til I'm sure that you're dead\\" about the masters of war. The average flow of 'The Freewheelin' is just charming, Dylan's little quarks and folk tales are flat out entertaining. Better than any T.V. show and better than most books or poetry. It's the perfect expression of daily life. Without a doubt this is a folk album unlike others later in his career, if you have an itching for the much more rockish Dylan this is not recommended, but is defiantly worth a try if you want expand your taste of Ziggerman's talents. This was extraordinary in 1963 and will feel the same in 2005 if you haven't heard it yet.<br /><br />Music - 4 1/4  Vocals - 5  Longevity - 5  Diverseness - 4
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. Clever lyrics, memorable riffs, and tight musicianship make this one a real keeper. Ignore the a**hole below me, along with all the other hair metal loving rejects, and add this to your cart.
B00005NKK8|5.0|J'ai achet ce disque il y a une dizaine d'annes,  une poque o mes connaissances musicales taient assez limites, et je dois reconnatre qu'aujourd'hui, alors que ma discothque s'est largement agrandie, je prends toujours autant de plaisir  couter cette compilation. <br />Evidemment, la morale un peu bate du film peut faire sourire, mais ne boudons pas notre plaisir, c'est souvent drle, rgulirement touchant, impeccablement interprt et dot d'un solide scnario. En plus, il est trs largement suprieur  ses pendants europens (le trs surestim Amlie Poulain, de Jean-Pierre Jeunet, o Paris est dpeinte comme si c'tait DisneyLand, l'pouvantable La Vie Est Belle, de Roberto Benigni, o la description des camps de concentration est  vomir) <br />Le track listing ralise quasiment un sans faute, alternant artistes connus (E.

0875428940|5.0|Without being even at the level of actually doing layouts, ive come to love these cards very quickly. They are my first deck and im certain they are the best choice i could have made for my \\"beginning\\". The symbolism, colour choices and imagery seems easy to connect with and deep and powerfull at the same time. On top of that the cards are absolutily and simply - beautiful! Im looking forward to going deeper into the realm of tarot : )
B00006ZXSK|4.0|There are over 500 versions of Cinderella in existence in the world today, but this is perhaps the most enjoyable. The director made this version for a specific purpose - to teach his two daughters that they shouldn't be waiting for a prince and a big house to make them happy. The lesson is taught with sincerity and humor within a great story.  <br /> <br />Danielle De Barbarac grows up with her stepmother and two stepsisters - one evil, one not so evil - after her beloved father passes away. The first time she meets the prince is when she throws apples at him for stealing a horse, and the second when she goes to rescue a household servant dressed as a courtier. The prince pays her no attention the first time, but is instantly taken the second as she is intelligent and witty \\"...for anyone who can quote Thomas Moore is worth it.\\" And so continues the courtship, with Danielle in disguise, until Henry finds out the truth at the mask ball.  <br /> <br />Of course, the story ends happily, but I really liked the way it began...a woman telling two men of her great great grandmother's courage and wit, thus telling us, it's not a fairy tale, but only reduced to one after so many versions have been told over time \\"...the point, gentlemen, is not that they lived happily ever after, but that they lived.\\"  <br /> <br />The movie is well acted, especially by Dougray Scott (Henry) and Angelica Huston (stepmother). Da Vinci's and the King and Queen's humor are not to be missed, they have some great lines, especially when it comes to Henry's arranged marriage. The supporting cast is also great. I gave it four stars, however, because I didn't think much of Drew Barrymore's performance in the film, to me she was not as strong as her co-stars. Her accent faltered a lot, and she was unable to keep it consistent throughout the movie. Unlike some other actresses, Drew does not fit into a period piece, and she wouldn't have been my first choice for a fiesty Cinderella. Also, the script was well written in some parts, not not in others. I don't think people used phrases such as \\"money to burn\\" and \\"you've got bigger problems\\" in 16th century France.  <br /> <br />But overall, those minor inconsistenices are outshined by the story, characters and their wit and humor. This is a great film for all ages, and I would definitely recommend it.
0385338686|5.0|I adored and loved this!!  Each book that Sophie Kinsella graces her readers with, just seems to get better and better!  This is a stand alone novel full of fun and a great choice for anyone looking to relax and escape a stressful day, at least for a while!<br /><br />It was so easy for me to become engrossed in this story and experience Samantha's struggles to come to terms with her past.  To me, this story seemed to have a bit more depth than the Shopaholic series (which I loved, also)It was fun to go along for the ride, as Samantha learned how to deal with the everyday things such as cooking and cleaning, which she never had to deal with before.  Also watching her \\"bloom\\" into someone who learns to enjoy and love the everyday simple things - such as the scent of flowers, just sitting and appreciating nature around and maybe even a colorful hot air balloon!<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and enjoyable read.
0757302661|5.0|This book is incredible! It takes birthing back to it's simplicity in nature. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to take birthing back by calm!

B00005JN0T|4.0|Those expecting a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic book which this is supposedly based on will be more than disappointed here, as I, Robot is pure, solid, entertaining mainstream action with Alex Proyas, director of Dark City and the original Crow at the helm.  A beefed up Will Smith plays paranoid cop Del Spooner in future Chicago, and needless to say due to a past tragedy, he doesn't trust the \\"helper\\" robots which are abundant in society.  Spooner gets his wish of a robot possibly being a bad guy when a new design of robot (Alan Tudyk of the upcoming Serenity and TV's short lived Firefly) is accused of murdering his creator (James Cromwell).  Soon enough, Spooner is knee deep in a conspiracy involving this new model of robot, the obedience of the \\"3 laws of robotics\\", and whether this artificial life can evolve.  While it hardly bears any resemblance to Asimov's book, the spirit of it is still here, and Smith does a good job as the paranoid hero.  The CGI effects are well done for the most part, and Tudyk is superb as well.  It's not a perfect action/sci-fi movie, but for what it is, it's still pretty good.
B000002UDB|5.0|Though I'm a firm believer that \\"Yesterday And Today\\" and some other Capitol U.S. homemade Beatle albums eat doo-doo,this one trumped the E.P. version released in England.By putting the entire contents of the two disc E.P. on side one and two singles the Beatles released earlier that year,plus the Beatles current single on side two,Capitol came up one good listen of an album.No the cover wasn't PEPPER,REVOLVER or ABBEY ROAD,but you WILL remember it once you see it.No it's not all over the place like the WHITE ALBUM or folksy like RUBBER SOUL.It's just a good listen.John Lennon chimes in with \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\",\\"All You Need Is Love\\" and the album's best track,the utterly magnificent \\"I Am The Walrus\\".Paul chimes in \\"Penny Lane\\",\\"The Fool On The Hill\\" and \\"Hello Goodbye\\".<br /><br /> OVERALL:on a scale of 1 to 10:8.5<br /><br />  Magical Mystery Tour (Title Song) 8<br />  The  Fool On The Hill 9<br />  Flying 6<br />  Blue Jay Way 2.5<br />  You're Mother Should Know 9.25<br />  I Am The Walrus 11<br />  Hello Goodbye 9.5<br />  Strawberry Fields Forever 10<br />  Penny Lane 9.75<br />  Baby You're A Rich Man 9<br />  All You Need Is Love 10<br /><br />Despite being kinda underated,it's essential Beatles!!<br />NOTE:This album along with PEPPER contains everything they released during their psychedelic year that was 1967.
B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter's The Fog is an incredible movie.  What Carpenter and Debra Hill created here is a very good looking film that's very determined to scare and thrill it's audiences.  The story is less than thin, but it works.  It works because of strong performances, terrific special effects, and a great John Carpenter score.  The best thing about this film is that evil is not personified, as it was in the original Halloween.  This evil is everywhere (beware of the fog).  All in all, a terrific little scarefest that can be enjoyed by all John Carpenter fans, and people who like a little thrill and a little scare now and then.
B000002UAF|5.0|It wasn't anything wrong with PLEASE PLEASE ME,WITH or FOR SALE but of the first four (UK releases),this one was the best.Each of those albums had a few great songs but a few not so great songs to weigh them down.This album is Beatlemania at it's peak.Not a single throwaway on the whole album.<br /> From the first track,the title song to the last track,\\"I'll Be Back\\" this album is pure adrenaline.Even though they would go on to release several monumental albums in the next few years,none would be as heart pounding as this one.
0030839939|5.0|Solid State by Neil and Dave is a classic. I have the added advantage that I have access to the authors. But I do think there should be a second edition as a lot has been happening in solid state physics since 76.
0780626966|5.0|In addition to this being the obvious remastered collection of Wes Craven's finest horror films, there is tons of bonus material on each disc plus an additional disc dedicated to the extras!

The eighth disc is full of bonus material everyone is sure to enjoy!  I don't want to spoil any surprises, so order your set today!
B000AY807Q|4.0|This is the 1st Young album I've bought in many years. Probably the last thing I purchased by him was Re*Ac*Tor a long long time ago. \\"Prairie Wind\\" is a very nicely recorded and performed work, but some of it could have been better. Too many slow tunes. Tracks 8, 9 and 10 drag down the album, \\"When God Made Me\\" not a good way to end the  CD, a faster more guitar-oriented track would have been a better closer. And that song about Elvis? Filler, very inane lyrics. Some electric guitar would have been nice too, although I suppose Neil's aim with this particular project was a full acoustic recording. I always loved all the great guitar on classic tracks such as \\"Cinnamon Girl,\\" \\"Down By The River\\" and many many others. I hope in the future, Young will someday go back to a straight rock & roll album. The same could be said for Sir Paul McCartney. Good new album but not enough rockers.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Finally, the remastered classic we've been waiting to be released!  This box set is definitely worth the wait we had to endure while the producers blocked sales of the original version!  There is plenty of bonus material in addition to the movies being remastered with noticeable improvements.
630575070X|5.0|Uh, yeah, this is a movie I absoluetly love! There were many cool scenes, such as the fight with battle and destroyer droids, the pod race between young Anakin and Sebulba, the huge vehicles and the huge gunfire from them, the gunfights with Queen Amidala and the Gungans and soldiers, and of course the unforgettable clash between Obi-Wan Kenobi/Qui Gon Jinn and Darth Maul(my # 1 favorite villain in all of Star Wars)It was awesome to see him fight with two well trained Jedis all by himself. And also, there were many funny parts like with Jar Jar Binks, and all sorts of scary and suspenseful moments, be it underwater or above ground. There was a lot of cool explosions, as well. When I saw this for the first time in the theatre, I couldn't wait to see it again on VHS! And now I have. I recommend this film to anyone with even 1 tiny little shred of liking for Star Wars material. It rocks!! And it is among the best I've ever seen.
B0009MAO46|5.0|Finally, after a long wait this family favorite is available once again, but this time it's packing bonus material and extras the original was missing.  Whatever your age, you are sure to enjoy this movie!  As with all Disney movies, this one will be locked away in the vault soon, so don't miss your chance to order your copy today!
B00009TB5G|5.0|What can I say. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE(which I liked a lot)IT HAS LOTS OF COOL, SCARY, AND OR FUNNY SCENES, IT IS FULL OF BLOOD, MANY OF THE BEST CHARACTERS(such as Frodo, Samwise, Gandalf, Sauron, Gollum, and the elf Princess)ARE BACK, THERE IS MORE ARROWS, SWORDS, SPEARS, CATAPULTS, AND ORCS TO KILL THAN EVER BEFORE, THERE ARE LOTS MORE GROSS OUT SCENES OF GORE AND SLIME, THE TWO TOWERS ARE REAL COOL LOOKING, AND THERE'S SUCH GOOD ACTING AND GRAPHICS I CAN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT! I'VE SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY! DON'T WAIT ANOTHER SECOND! SEE THIS FILM NOW!!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! NOT ONE BLOODY LITTLE BIT!!!!!!!!
B000AY807Q|4.0|Lazy Journalism. Every time Neil makes an acoustic or countryish album, its hailed as a sequel to Harvest or the 3rd part in the apparent Trilogy after Harvest Moon. Only problem - reviews have said that about \\"comes a time\\", \\"old ways\\", and \\"silver and gold\\" already. Lazy lazy lazy.  <br /> <br />This album stand on its own, with 3 tracks instant classics - tracks 1, 2, and 10. Best album in 11 years, but doesn't quite reach the heights of \\"sleeps with angels\\", only slightly better than \\"greendale\\". Overall this is recommended.
B00005JMJG|2.0|By the title of this review, one can surmise that I'm not wild about Jim Carrey.  Didn't like the Truman Show, didn't like Ed Almighty or whatever his name was in that.  In this movie, he was supposed to be playing it straight, and I guess for Jim Carrey, he was.  I wanted so much to like this movie, to see Jim C redeem himself in my eyes like Bill Murray did in Groundhog Day (although I'm sure he could care less), but it's still him. <br /> <br />And I think once you are told the conceit of the story, the rest of the plot is pretty obvious by and large.  I loved Kate Winslet in this (by the way, make sure you see her in the first episode of the new HBO show, \\"Extras.\\") and there are one or two other good moments, but it is by no means a really good movie.  Come to think of it, stick with Groundhog Day. It covers similar ground and does it much better, funnier and a better developed plot (and it stars the newly redeemed Bill Murray moving in the direction of being able to eventually star in Lost in Translation -- the sort of film I like.)
B000A88F22|1.0|Eggplant hit the nail on this POS of a show. For a good show, watch Family Guy, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Chapelle's Show, and the almight Mind of Mencia.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I just finished listening to this for about the 5th time.  This is a stirring and beautiful piece of work for Mr Young.  His vocal and lyrics are palpable with emotion and the stripped down effect of he and his guitar with a outstanding band made me feel his music. <br />This is one of his best, do yourself a favor and listen to this album and read the lyrics.   <br />Thanks Neil.
B00006AW2J|5.0|In my oppinion, this is the Stones' best album (many of you will hate me for this, but I can't stand Let it Bleed). The lyrics are some of the best that the Stones ever wrote, with songs like Sumpathy for the Devil, Street Fighting Man, and Salt of the Earth making powerful political and social statments in the Stones' uniquely sloppy style of poetry. The album features acoustic instruments prominently, which adds to it's raw, earthy mistique. <br />-Sympathy for the Devil may be my favorite Rolling stones song ever. The lyrics are incredible, the beat is amazingly catchy and the jagged guitar solos hit like a sledgehammer. <br />-No expectations is dark and mellow with very personal lyrics and haunting slide guitar. <br />-Parachute Woman has a great bluesy vibe. The instrumentation is thick and groovy and the lyrics are dark and sleazy but still cool. <br />-Streetfighting Man tends to get a little repetative, but the lyrics are excellent and the sitar is a great touch. Very cool instrumentals. <br />-Prodigal Son is an incredible haunting country blues song. The great rootsy vibe keeps the sparse instumentals from getting dull. <br />-Stray Cat Blues has the sleaziest lyrics in the album,which may leave a bad taste in some peoples mouths, but the intoxicating guitar has an incredible raw sound and the beat is great. <br />-Factory Girl is another haunting coutry blues song. The Stones realy nailed the American roots music sound on this album. <br />-Salt of The Earth is a great closer the begins with bleak, shaky vocals but ends with a rocking jam.
6305971099|1.0|There are three main characters in this movie:<br /><br />1)  A little girl in a hospital bed who is constantly going into spasmodic seizures.  Oh, the joy of watching this.<br /><br />2)  Loomis, acting like a certified paranoid schizophrenic.  Oh, the joy of watching this.<br /><br />3)  Some teenage girl who obviously did so much coke before filming each scene that she's almost literally climbing up the walls.  Oh, the joy...<br /><br />Other than that, some guy in a silly mask walks around doing an imitation of Data from Star Trek.  Apparently this is supposed to be scary?  I can't quite imagine how.<br /><br />Skip this one and get just about any other slasher ever made instead.
B00097DX3U|5.0|The band Audioslave continues to refresh my memories of why the individual entities in this band are great musicians in the first place. And having seen them live in the streets of Hollywood for \\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\\" helps me appreciate their dedication to great music even more, especially when I knew Tom Morello was playing 10 feet away from where I stood and Chris Cornell's grand voice which has stuck with me for the better part of the last 10 years is echoing not far from Tom.  The second album is clearly more matured and superior to the debut, and each song shows this. I'm glad I bought this CD, because I consider this the rock record of 2005 thus far.  Here are my reviews of the individual tracks: <br /> <br />1. Your Time has come: Yes, to most people here it does sound like \\"Cochise: Episode II- attack of the riff clone\\", but to me the song stands out well on its own. Especially the bass playing. Great track to start off. <br /> <br />2. Out of Exile- the band's first title track also shows excellent songwriting by Cornell and great drumming by Wilk. Should be more noticed. <br /> <br />3. Be yourself- the lead single, and still a weird choice to me for a theme song for a WWE star. But regardless, this is the catchiest song on the CD, and a good listen. <br /> <br />4. Doesn't remind me- The latest, and best, single out of the band. Great sing along song, and it really really sounded awesome live.  <br /> <br />5. Drown me Slowly- The most underrated hard song here, Chris made a good choice of declaring this a personal favorite of his from the album. Strong performances abound. <br /> <br />6. Heaven's dead- The second best song for me lyrically on the CD, and one that can easily fit into either Temple of the Dog or \\"Euphoria Morning\\". Hm.... <br /> <br />7. The Worm- I immediately thought of Zeppelin's \\"Black Dog\\" upon the opening riffs of the song, and it does sound very similar to that legendary tune. Zep or not,the song stands out thanks to Cornell's handling of the chorus, and now I have a new appreciation of the word \\"Halo\\" outside of its spiritual or video game meaning. <br /> <br />8. Man or Animal- This to me is the \\"Exploder\\" of this album; underrated, catchy, and fun to sing along to when you know what this song is about. Awesome track. <br /> <br />9. Yesterday to tomorrow- I dont like this song much, perhaps because of how it drags on a bit. The only bad part of the album, IMO <br /> <br />10. Dandelion- Now this is Audioslave showing its softer side...wow...I cant help but think of Chris singing this to his family...pretty, awesome track in every way. <br /> <br />11. #1 Zero- more revenge minded track, this one goes off a bit weird for the band, but overall, good track. <br /> <br />12. The Curse- Longest and perhaps most complicated track on the album. Great listen if you're willing to hang on. Grreat closer to an incredible album. <br /> <br />
B000AXSN5G|1.0|What happened to the Neil we know and love?  The one-man, one-guitar, one-harmonica Neil singing intense yet simple lyrics in that shaky yet appropriate voice?  Where is the Neil of After the Gold Rush or Tonight's the Night or even Silver and Gold?  Where did all the polish come from and why is it necessary? Does this record HAVE to do well at Wal Mart?  This might be Neil's worst album ever.  It is over produced, over dubbed and over done in almost every regard and in a way contrary to everything Neil has ever said about his music.  There's not an interesting or redeeming song in the entire mix, not a tune worth humming, or a riff worth learning.  As unbelievable as it might be, this album may be a sign that Neil is done, out of ideas, and no longer relevant.  I am a HUGE Neil Young fan and it hurts me to listen to this record.  This is not the Neil we know and love and I do not recommend Prairie Wind to anyone not riding in an elevator.
0446614459|3.0|I've read all the Baldacci books to date and I'm really getting tired of this terrible description of 'casual eating'. I counted 4 or 5 usages of the various forms of the word 'munch' in this book and really have to comment.  <br /> <br />The story has been reviewed many times by others here and I agree it's an OK story but not exceptional. The villain is portrayed as a sinister expert with weaponry and surveillance but when you find out who it is, none of this makes a whole lot of sense. The twists and red herrings are pretty good and the romantic sub-plots are not too cliche. <br /> <br />But... please, if David Baldacci, his editors or other aspiring writers read these reviews, I beg you to stop using the word 'munch' to describe eating anything other than crunchy or crispy food like chips. And if you must use it, please only use it once or twice at most.
B000068PQ0|4.0|A concept album about a Japanese girl battling pink robots. Whatever you are on, Wayne Coyne, pass it this way! <br /> <br />Seriously, this is a great album. While it doesn't reach the peaks of their previous album (the superb Soft bulletin), this expands on the thematic nature of that record into their first concept album. When most people hear the phrase concept album, a certain word springs to mind. Pretension. And there's no doubt that this is a pretentious album, but it's a great pretentious album. <br /> <br />Opener Fight test (which \\"borrows\\" its tune from the classic Cat Stevens song Father and son) sets the scene. The theme only really runs over the 2 semi-title tracks where Wayne Coyne sings that Yoshimi is going to battle the pink robots, and then she battles them. The rest of the album is just a headtrip of mellow spaced out numbers. <br /> <br />A great album to chill out to, even if it lacks the depth of The soft bulletin.
0060989157|5.0|This is the best biography of a rock band that I have ever read!  It is most entertaining and well written.  Most of the book made me shake my head and laugh to myself.    It was very informative and gave the perspectives of the different people involved.  Example:  Vince and Tommy's fight at the airport is written from Vince's, Tommy's and Nikki's perspective in consecutive chapters.   <br /> <br />If you love the Crue - this is the book for you!  Even if you are just a lover of music - you have to read about the band that pushed the limits in everything they did; making the 1980's truly the decade of excess!
B00006F7S4|4.0|It's easy to knock Beck, but you gotta respect a guy who has released so many different sounding albums. <br /> <br />There's his most popular effort Odelay which fused all sorts of music from hiphop, jazz and country into a coherent whole. Even though I'll openly admit that I'm not a fan of that album, it's still considered by many to be one of the greatest albums of the 90's. <br /> <br />Mutations was an incredibly diverse album which worked really well for me. Midnite vultures (from what I have heard of it) is his Prince album. <br /> <br />This, on the other hand, is his Nick Drake album. Like Blood on the tracks before it, this is Beck's breakup album. It's an incredibly lush piece of work that gets better with every listen. Many classic albums from the history of rock have been borne out of tragedy - Neil Young's classic Tonight's the night being a prime example of this. <br /> <br />An honest and emotional record, this is Beck's finest work to date.
0060090383|4.0|Wow! I did not expect this book to take such an introspective, painful, intense turn. But it is clear that the first part was seen entirely from the denial state of Rachel regarding her addiction. It should asbolutely not classified as chick-lit: it narrates an intense life-turning experience, and even if the end is just a little bit corny, I was really really happy about the way things turned out!
B0000025HU|5.0|I have always gone against the popular critical outlook when it comes to double albums by big bands. Many fans and critics, for instance, argued that The White Album would have been better if it were released as a single album. \\"Sacrilegious!\\" I say. I can't think of many examples where I prefer a single album by a band who has released a double album. The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, The Clash. Best albums? The White Album, Blonde On Blonde, Exile On Main St., London Calling (respectively). All killer no filler? Well, no. All of these albums have filler, albeit surprisingly little in most cases. Mostly, however, the filler simply adds to the charm of these brilliant albums. Double albums gave artists the much needed breathing space that they didn't have with LPs, allowing them to experiment a little and dip their toes into musical waters they wouldn't normally swim in within the confines of a single LP. Even if a song doesn't work on a double album, the listener can relax, knowing that there's \\"plenty more when that came from\\". <br /> <br />London Calling is a very unique double album as it has surprisingly little filler. The Clash took a big risk with this album, releasing a 19-track 65-minute album that went completely against the punk roots of their previous two albums. This album encompasses a sprawling array of musical genres - there's jazz (Jimmy jazz), rockabilly (Brand new cadillac), ska (Hateful, Rudie can't fail, Wrong 'em boyo), reggae (The guns of Brixton), pop (Train in vain, Spanish bombs, Lost in the supermarket), punk (London calling, Clampdown, Death or glory, Koka kola) and even an epic tale of deceit (The card cheat). Yes, this album has it ALL. And unlike their extremely patchy follow up Sandinista, it ALL works. <br /> <br />The 8-song run from Jimmy Jazz to The guns of Brixton is one of the greatest sequences of music ever released. Classics, the lot of them. The tunes! The lyrics! The energy! The passion! On most of the songs on this album, it sounds like these guys are simply having a hell of a lot of fun trying out new stuff. It's like they had all this creative energy bottled up and they exploded this energy on to four sides of vinyl. <br /> <br />All killer no filler? Sure is. And 65 minutes of it to boot!
B000AL730O|1.0|This effort is from a man that wrote \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\". When you keep this phrase in mind whilst listening to this cd, you simply cannot believe how melodically bereft this album is. Unfortunately, Macca has lost the art of writing hooks with any real quality. I first believed that McCartney II was an insult to his legion of fans, well this comes pretty close (albeit with better production). For those reading this review - yes I am a McCartney fan. I was a 12 year old that copped flack back in 79 for buying \\"Back To The Egg\\" and also believed that \\"Daytime, Nightime Suffering\\" was a great b side. Ah well at least I can go back and live in the past. I really, really hope this is not Macca's final album as it fails dismally to the final album he made with his \\"real\\" band - Abbey Road.
B000069AUI|4.0|Their debut album Parachutes had sweet melodies and great vocals but it didn't really expand on the template that Travis had created on The man who. Luckily for Coldplay, they chose to progress for their 2nd album A rush of blood to the head. <br /> <br />Rush of blood builds on the melodic foundation of Parachutes but it rocks out a lot more. And the ballads like The Scientist are tighter songs that are made for waving cigarette lighters at gigs. Clocks is an amazing cut even though it's been killed by overplay, and its inclusion in television advertisements. The only track that I would call disappointing on this album is the debut single In my place, which sounds like an offcut from their debut album. <br /> <br />All in all, an incredibly solid 2nd album. It's easy to dismiss Coldplay nowadays, but it's even easier to listen to this album and truly enjoy it.
B00005KB9T|4.0|...and (if you're Babylon) you're gonna get burned. The tables have turned for Bob Marley and the Wailers as they gain international recognition for this fledgling art form called reggae. They ditched the suits and the phoniness, projected their Rastafarian beliefs in their music, and sang about real issues--currently and historically--that (up to that point) was never a moneymaker in hit music. They literally broke the mold with this album and \\"Burnin'\\" <br /> <br />\\"Slave Driver\\" and \\"Concrete Jungle\\" are perfect examples of how these guys literally started reggae music by just slowing the tempo on ska and (with a lotta ganja smoke) began the \\"easy skanking\\" era in world music. And now it remains an international phenomenon and it's influence especially on British and American music and fans is still evident more than 30 years after these albums were recorded. <br /> <br />More than that, these songs mean a lot more to people than most songs. They reflect the common man, the struggles of a group of people at the hands of the \\"privileged\\". Obviously those in power disliked Bob Marley. The rest of the world loved him...and still do.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Also known as: when Wilco became really good. Their first album A.M. wasn't a lot more than pretty good alt-country. Their 2nd ambitious double album Being there had its fair share of brilliant moments, but some filler as well (as most double albums do). Summerteeth definitely started to show promise. But Yankee hotel foxtrot was where all cylinders started firing. <br /> <br />There's not really a dud song in the bunch. Experimental opener I am trying to break your heart sets the scene. 7 minutes of streams-of-consciousness ramblings from Jeff Tweedy set to a musical backing that's part dream-pop and part electronic blips. And it doesn't outstay its welcome for a second. <br /> <br />Elsewhere, we have superb pop (Heavy metal drummer, War on war and Pot kettle black), gorgeous country (Jesus etc.) and epic ballads (Ashes of American flags and Reservations). Wilco took huge risks with this album and the returns came rolling in.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|5 STARS all the way. WTF are you people talking about giving it a 1 star review. You obviously have no taste/respect for the roots of rock and roll..and particularly the towering figure that really influenced everything since. Buy this album if you havent..actually buy any beatles album from HELP to Let it be. They are all near or completely flawless. They had the best run in musical history and thats not nearly an overstatement. They deserve the admoration they get. The last thing we need is uneducated kids my age out there bashing the greatest band to grace our lives just because its not the cool thing to do. Fads come and go..but the Beatles will last forever..simply put. From Ozzy Osbourned-to Bob Dylan..to Nirvana all the way up to heavy metal acts have given them credit for shaping modern music. Bashing them is pure jelousy or bad taste. There's two sets of people in music..those who appreciate the Beatles influence and music, and those like some that have posted on here that have never given it a chance or are following the anti beatles sentimate for those who hate anything that is popular.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Comfortable. That's how I'd describe the new Neil Album. It's familiar and down home-y. At the same time there's also an odd quality of The Dating Game horns meets Nashville. Strange as that sounds Neil somehow makes it work, and makes it seem as natural as wood. It takes me back and forth to the past and yet it still manages something new and different. That's what I love about Neil.
B000002UAR|5.0|Unlike some ..lets say foolish people, who claim this material (or any post 65' Beatles music) is dated it is not. And simply music does not date, thats a nonsense statement. Music much like art can never date, its not something that spoils like meat left out in the heat.  <br /> <br />The album, along with Rubber Soul, Sgt. Peppers, White Album, Abbey Road, and even Let it be are among the best albums ever created. People only tend to knock it because these albums are popular and have lasted the test of time. Also-If I were to suggest any ONE Beatles album (thats sort of like saying which child would you save to a father with a family)...I would probably lean towards MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR myself. Can't loose with the flawless Strawberry Fields forever, I am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Fool on the Hill, and more. But Revolver CERTAINLY is deserving as well.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|When this movie came out and I heard the title, I thought, \\"no way, it'll be one big bore-fest\\" but when I did see it, I found it to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Probably one of my favorites of all time. A MUST-SEE!
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Clerks is the film that introduced us to the mind and wit of Kevin Smith. Clerks is an independent film that has become a part of our culture. For every person who has held a job where they deal with customers everyday this is the film for you. Kevin Smith has put on film every feeling we have had about customers. And it doesn't matter that you don't work in a convenience or video store. This movie applies to anyone who deals with customers on a day to day basis. When you see this film you can relate to what these two guys go through every day. The annoying customers with their constant stupid questions and annoying requests. Now we may not take out our aggresions on the customers but Kevin Smith has done it for us with Clerks. This is an excellent film and I am glad that it has been re-released in this 3 disc set. YOu get both the original film and the director's cut. While I still prefer the original version over the director's cut, I am glad to have both of them in this set. Also Kevin Smith's commentaries are legendary. You are guaranteed a laugh when you listen to any of his DVD commentaries. And there are also some great documentaries and shorts on this set. Just like when he first made this film by maxing out his credit cards and borrowing moeny from everyone he knew, Kevin Smith has truly put his heart and soul into this set and I am glad to have it as a part of my collection.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|This is a blockbuster documentary.  I think anyone who likes music should watch an utter genius in formation.  Man, Dylan was great singing that song for \\"Wonder Boys.\\" and to think \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\" is only considered an average song.  Dylan has lasted because he is vital and important.  I hope he keeps charging forward with his music, because I think he will have interesting things to say as he ages.<br /><br />As Steve Allen said during Dylan's appearence on that show in 1964, \\"genius knows no rules.\\"  How true it is.  Like most geniuses, Dylan arrives from Hibbing, Minnesota as Robert Zimmerman, like some kind of space alien. He is just a special being not tethered to the reality of place. He could have been from Timbuktu somehow.  It sure didn't seem to matter - or did it.  Perhaps being from the bland post-war Midwest is what gave him the ingredients to work with.<br /><br />Dylan is an artist.  The reviewer who below said that Dylan was not a poet is politely a nincompoop.  Dylan is a great poet, whose songs transcend his accompanying music and his awful voice.  But who cares about his voice.<br /><br />In reality, all you hear is the VOICE of a great artist. I was not around during the sixties.  I picked up a Dylan album after listening to \\"Dont talk twice it's alright\\" after breaking up with a girl.  That song spoke to me, and other songs spoke to me with their simplicity and ther beauty.<br /><br />In terms of this documentary, the tremendous archival footage is culled together in an utterly interesting and vital way.  You can see Dylan literally discover his genius as an artist.  This documentary captures interviews of the figures in Dylan's life, including the Beat generation poet Allen Ginsburg, Joan Baez, and others.  (Interesting to note is that Dylan says that Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\" didn't have much of an effect on him.)<br /><br />This is a film worth seeing because it gives you the life of the artist.  A rare and worthwhile glimpse into greatness.  Imagine if we had the same footage for Michaelangelo or Leonardo DiCaprio (I am kidding :))  I mean of course, Leonardo Da Vinci.  How great would that be, well you have a chance to discover a unique talent here with Scorcese's Dylan.  Enjoy.into greatness.  Imagine if we had the same footage for Michaelangelo or Leonardo DiCaprio (I am kidding :))  I mean of course, Leonardo Da Vinci.  How great would that be, well you have a chance to discover a unique talent here with Scorcese's Dylan.  Enjoy. <br /> <br />     <br />
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Only ultimately Bob Dylan reigns as the hero. He's gonna haunt you with the current interveiws; but he's still gonna make you laugh too. Scorsese put together a hell of a film DON'T MISS!<br />Joan Baez, wow. A lot of insight here. Bob Dylan is still the man. A  heart felt statement from Joan (and just wait for Dylans counter statement HES SO COOL!)<br />Also the man: AL KOOPER, he's the other hero in this film, that guy rocks! He'll make you laugh too. He's got himself a new solo album out now, did you know that? THE HAWKS also save the day as DYLANS allies by KICKIN' ACE!<br />DO NOT MISS THIS FILM.<br /><br />oh yeah, in case I forgot; MARTIN SCORSESE is the man too. ROCK AND ROLL!
B000003TA2|5.0|A friend of mine had a 7 ft. tall poster of this album cover that I always thought was pretty strange. One day while in the record store I believe a five fingered this one, out of curiosity.<br /><br />At first I didn't dig it at all; but soon found myself going back to it. Then going back to it again...<br /><br />So yeah, needless to say I became a fan of this album. Its very cool art rock. KIM GORDON is one creeepy chick man, and I like that a lot.  The one where she talks to her mom TUNIC sends shivers. \\"You ain't never going anywhere, I ain't never going anywhere...\\"<br /><br />The dude who sings is kind of sounds like a sissy but that doesn't stop his songs from hitting the mark. MARY CHRIST and even better DISSAPEAR.<br /><br />The highlights for me though are the KIM tracks; KOOL THING, the title track, CINDERELLA; \\"I don't wanna; I don't THINK so..\\"<br /><br />Very cool. I wish she would come to my house and talk to me that way.<br /><br />SOLID WORK YOUTH!<br /><br />P.S if you already knew everything about this album and were just checking up on your old friends maybe you didn't know that there is now a two disc expanded version of this album which includes mad outakes and lost cuts. I haven't had the time to check it out, but its there. C-YA.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|The program content, Star Trek The Original Series, rates five stars.  The DVD set drops a star for the slow loading menu that you have to keep going back to along with the other mandatory screens that you can't fast forward through.  So it's about as fast to find and view an episode as with the off-air VHS recordings that I made back in the early 80's, but the picture quality is better.
B00009NH5W|5.0|Oh my... I honestly did not think this album would be THAT good.  I had no idea what type of material was on this album, so I took a gamble based on others reviews and I must say that you guys did not let me down.  If the US would give this album a listen, this would be a hot seller... I guess we're not ready for him. I have a lot of favorite tracks, so I won't post my favorites... it's practically the whole album.  \\"Designated Fool\\" and, \\"What Shall I Do?\\" alone, is worth the money... I loved TTD in the 80s, but after hearing this CD, I have a new found respect for him... he is a true talent...not to mention that he arranged and wrote all of his tracks. I'm only in my 20s, but I love to listen to great music... and this is great music.  If you're contemplating on buying this album... buy it!! NOW!!
B0000042HV|5.0|I was more than a little pleased that my local public library acquired this wonderful CD set. While I tend to lean towards listening to full orchestras and symphonies, I must comment that this quartet has performed these compositions in such a tight but well-balanced manner that I was inspired to listen to the works over and over.<br /><br />Possibly the most significant facet of this set is that it provided me with a wonderful documentation of the clear musical growth of Dmitri Shostakovich over a period of years, albeit the very earliest of these compositions was spectacular.<br /><br />For the newbie to classical music, this CD set is a good acquisition although I would acquire Shostakovich's 5th, 9th and possibly the 13th Symphonies first. Also, if you like to play classical CDs as wallpaper while you read, this is the set for you!

B00025ETIW|4.0|Several good songs, and I haven't found any yet that I can't stand.
B000002UB3|5.0|Although this wasn't their last release; that would be LET IT BE, this would actually be the last time these FAB FOUR would ever record together. They knew that they needed something extra special to go out on and MAN they delivered.<br />How do you get better when you are already the best? Well, I suppose theres no way to answer this question- Just listen to ABBEY ROAD. I won't say its the best cuz all that ever does is cause an all out battle of the BEATLEMANIACS and really, i'm not one of those.<br />What I am, is a fan of solid music and what I will say is that it doesn't get any more solid than this. Take the first cut, COME TOGETHER, right away we start with the edgiest sounding Beatle recording yet.. moving on we get SOMETHING a power ballad 1969 style, very crisp guitar solos all over it. This isn't mop top stuff and it isn't multi colored Pepper coat stuff either. MAXWELL SILVER HAMMER is next, then we get into some heavy blues OH DARLING. OCTOPUSS GARDEN is another lighthearted tune to cascade us along and then we get was is easiest the edgiest, most balls to the wall BEATLES track ever SHES SO HEAVY. If you never heard this, you ain't heard nothing yet. This may make you re-evaluate who you think invented metal. This is some heavy friggen stuff and the guitars just escalate for almost seven minutes until suddenly you find yourself in the soft tender HERE COMES THE SUN.<br /><br />All this and the album has barely even BEGUN to take off. BECAUSE is the whole band harmonizing together (maybe not Ringo) creating this incredible ball of sound. YOU NEVER GIVE ME YOUR MONEY opens up what becomes a giant medley of songs, this one has very cool lyrics, some of the best in the Beatles songbook, SUN KING is next and then we rip into the meat. MEAN MR. MUSTARD, POLYTHENE PAM, SHE CAME IN THROUGH, GOLDEN SLUMBERS, CARRY THAT WEIGHT and THE END all weave together to make up the biggest finish an album has ever had,  EVER.<br />And if that wasn't enough you get a ten second little song at the very finish HER MAJESTY, which is like the cherry on the friken whipped cream.<br /><br />So anyway, like I said, I won't SAY it's the best...<br />But it really doesn't get any better.t the very finish HER MAJESTY, which is like the cherry on the friken whipped cream.    So anyway, like I said, I won't SAY it's the best...  But it really doesn't get any better.
B000001DTM|5.0|It wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that Achtung Baby represented to a certain generation of listeners what Exile On Main Street did to another: an anthemic statement about what it meant to be alive during that period.  Its songs still hold up remarkably well, and, as evidence of a great band at the top of its form, still speak powerfully of the emotions each elicits.  Solitude, anger, remorse, regret, hope: an open-minded listener can find them all here.  And for a group that so often has sung of the inequities of human against human, Achtung Baby surprisingly is intensely personal in that each song represents its own little reaction against heartbreak. <br /> <br />A great album, a classic.  One that truly deserves consideration as among the best ever.
B000002J03|5.0|ZEPPELIN II is one album that can't be F#@KED WITH! It is an unstoppable force that no one has control over. This is one of those records that, when it was released the suits wanted so bad to hide, but they couldn't! It was the first album to take THE BEATLES off the charts in 1969. It was an instant smash hit and it was bringing out the crazy side in everyone!<br /><br />This was what was to come. While rock in the 50's and 60's were making the girls shake their naughty back sides, it seemed that rock in the seventies was gonna make the girls DRIP with sex. Its the most powerful rock around and the minute you press play you'll know why.<br /><br />WHOLE LOTTA LOVE doesn't let you go, with the tripped out mid, this thing is a pressure cooker. WHAT IS is next, starts off kind of like a lounge act but very soon starts ripping again, LEMON SONG is a takeoff of a few old blues tunes and meshed into one ZEP madhouse of love and deception! SQUEEZE ME BABY! TILL THE JUICE RUNS DOWN MY LEG! Next up is THANK YOU, a ballad strictly for chicks. Chicks love this song, I don't, but its ok because its just an intermission to the thunder; a double header HEARTBRAKER> LIVING LOVING MAID, the best riffs ever one after the next. These songs should never be listened to seperately, RAMBLE ON is a little lighter, but just a little, MOBY DICK is a thumping drum solo by BONZO mixed with some unholy riffery that crashes us into the bluesy finale BRING IT HOME; notice the change in lyrics from \\"I'm gonna bring it on home to you,\\" into \\"bring it on home to ME\\" this was a big thing in the day- Nobody covered this in any way shape or form the way ZEPPELIN did.<br /><br />Talk about the power of rock? This album takes the intensity of their first album and gives it a sheet of acid and a bottle of whiskey then let it run wild with some crazy groupies. The excess just got wilder and multiple nations of youth were hanging on tight! Some of them still are today. ITS IN MY HEAD MAN! ITS IN MY HEAD AND MY SOUL! AHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRR!HHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRR!
B000AXSN5G|2.0|Let's establish right up front that I love Neil Young and have great admiration for his body of work, which includes some of the greatest Rock and Singer-Songwriter albums of all time.<br /><br />It also includes a lot of \\"product,\\" albums cranked out to fulfill contractual obligations, amortize studio time etc., and bizarre exercises in self-indulgence (\\"Trans,\\" \\"Greendale\\").<br /><br />That having been said, this album falls squarely into the \\"product\\" category. Young seems to have run out of original things to say (family is good? time fades away? umm... yeah). Not only is this no \\"Harvest,\\" it's not even up to the level of \\"Harvest Moon,\\" for God's sake. It is a rehash of rehashed material, musically unimaginative and lyrically banal, with strangely sterile-sounding (lots of overdubs?) production. In short, this album is a major disappointment. Not horrible, not good, just...there. Barely.<br /><br />If one is seeking an album where the artist ponders the meaning of life while facing the spectre of death, look no further than Warren Zevon's \\"The Wind,\\" a masterpiece that dwarfs this minor effort.<br /><br />Revisiting these comments a few months later, and seeing the plethora of 4 and 5-star reviews, I can't help but feel that many people are reviewing the album that they wish this was, instead of the album that Neil delivered.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|This cd touches the best songs off of each of her albums. My 2 fav new songs are \\"My Prerogative\\" and \\"I've Just Begun (Having my fun)\\". You have to get this to complete your Britney collection.
B00009Z576|5.0|Yes is infamous for its line-up changes. At least 14 musicians have been part of this five-person outfit, with superstar keyboardist Rick Wakeman leaving and rejoining the band four times!<br /><br />And with 1980's Drama, Yes for the first time lost two members at once, Wakeman and singer Jon Anderson. Yes shocked the world by replacing them with Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn - aka the Buggles - best known for their pop hit, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star.\\"<br /><br />But even more shocking - the album is excellent.<br /><br />First, the songwriting is a big improvement over the previous effort, the uneven \\"Tormato.\\" Virtually every song on \\"Drama\\" is a first rate composition.<br /><br />The direction of the album is heavier, highlighted by the big and dramatic \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" and the manic prog/punk/ska of \\"Tempus Fugit,\\" certainly two of the best Yes songs ever. The musicianship is excellent, especially from bassist Chris Squire and keyboardist Downes.<br /><br />Horn does a nice job handling lead vocals, especially when singing with Squire. His voice is similar to Anderson's, yet has its own character. And the production and sound are the best in years, with gifted producer Eddie Offord returning to help with the production.<br /><br />The only downsides are the album seems a bit sparse at times; the band was under strong time pressure, and probably prevented it from fleshing out the album's sound. And the otherwise great \\"Machine Messiah\\" is somewhat thrown off by its quasi-heavy metal intro.<br /><br />But all in all, Drama is a great addition to the Yes catalogue, and is highly recommended.<br /><br />(This version features 10 bonus tracks, most of which are excellent. \\"Go Through This\\" is an excellent instrumental version of an unreleased Drama song. The two tracking songs are interesting alternate versions. The last four songs are from 1979's aborted Paris sessions with Anderson-Howe-Squire-Wakeman-White; while far from Yes' best work, they are of interest to any Yes completist.)rk, they are of interest to any Yes completist.)  <br />
B00005OM4N|5.0|Only knowing one song (Slave 4 U), I purchased this cd in hopes of a great collection. And I'm glad I did. Overprotected was worth the $13 or however much the CD was. I love that song! Bombastic Love is my favorite as well. Britney is just a great entertainer!
B00067BBSC|5.0|This is probably one of the best concerts ever on DVD.  If you only have enough money to buy one DVD, this is it!  There are several surprises you can find in the concert.  Simon Phillips (drums) blends extremely well with the rest of the band.  You won't notice Jeff Porcaro has gone.  His style of playing gives the fans a new 'look' on the songs.  He's simply energetic and very creative.  You'll know what I mean when you watch the track \\"White Sister\\".  Mike Pocaro (bass) forms a solid rhythm section with Phillips.  He steals a lot of the spotlight from Steve Lukather.  Bobby Kimball is as good as always, adding 'life' to the tracks.  Steve Lukather (guitar) is fantastic.  I'm so moved when he plays \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  By the way the Toto version of \\"Bodhisattva\\" is as good as Steely Dan.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Sorry people, I like Britney's music! This was was better than baby one more time... I play this one today as well. However, her sexuality exploded with this album and all the others after. It was too bad she was aimed toward young girls so much.
1401201911|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this story and would rate it right up there behind Dark Knight Returns and Daredevil : Born Again ( haven't read Watchmen yet ). <br /> <br />I love elseworlds stories , particularly with Superman because the common criticism is that he's indestructable and it becomes repetitive and boring.  <br /> <br />My only criticism of the book is the shocking twist with the Russian Batman which doesn't really make sense. The re-imaginings of Superman , Batman , Wonder Woman , Lex Luthor , Lois Lane , and Green Lantern are interesting and there is wonderful little references that made me excited to keep reading. The artwork was impressive and the propoganda and political slant was done quite well.  <br /> <br />I waited awhile to pick this up but you shouldn't.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Whew, whee, this is one sexy CD. Her sexuality really shows through on this one. I don't see why women couldn't identify with Britney on this collection. Or any for that matter. Sing along with this CD and you'll feel like a sexy beast for sure!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a well-developed DVD set.  The show itself is amazingly well done.  The plot, the settings and effects, the cast, the character development is awesome.  I had no prior knowledge of this series, and I was hooked by the pilot.  To my great pleasure, the following series of shows continued to build plot and the characters with a quality in a television program that I have not seen for a very long time. <br />This set is a must see for anyone who enjoys sci fi, adventure, and/or drama, all with a clever twist of humor.  It is a REALLY good idea to see this series before watching the movie Serenity so you have a good background.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|I've been a big fan for years and this effort does not disappoint. In fact the more I listen the the stronger it gets.  Buddy delivers raw and honest emotion throughout on a variety of tunes with highlighted by some special guests. A reccomended disc.
0060751967|5.0|I'm not much for longwinded reviews, but this book was really fun to read.  I enjoyed the witty reparte and the story line was a lot of fun.  Not too intense and in no way boring, this is one I'll keep on my shelf to read again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I LOVED this show when it had it's run on FOX.  I nearly cried when it was cancelled.  I was happy again to at least see it come out on DVD. <br /> <br />And now the movie opens in two days and the reviews I've read make it seem like it will not disappoint! <br /> <br />Do you like lame, brainless \\"reality\\" TV?  Don't buy this DVD set then.  This is for people who actually want to watch an entertaining TV show with real characters that have been developed. <br /> <br />Hell, when you have guys all hot for the \\"fat\\" girl in the show, you know SOMETHING'S cool (and by \\"fat\\", I mean the actress was asked to gain 20 pounds so she looks like she enjoys a hamburger every now and then). <br /> <br />Not convinced?  Rent the DVDs through Netflix - you'll only buy them to keep later on.  This was a fantastic cast, amazing writing, and there was such a huge fanbase that it got made into a movie.   <br /> <br />It's gotta be great.
B000002JSJ|5.0|If I was this would be one I'd want. Between the bluesy rock rifs and Plants sensual/hip shaking lyrics you can't go wrong. Achillies Last Stand is an anthem all to its own. Presence is probably Zeppelin most underrated production but to me its Zep at their prime taking no prisoners and elevating their game. Keep in mind it was recorded in 72 hours.  Just unbelievable!
0142000663|3.0|This is a good book, but it is a tad long a wordy at times.
B00005LK94|5.0|Excellent family film, with comedy and excitement mixed with emotion. The music score of Mark Isham really captures the feelings and moods of the story. Great cinematography
B000A0GP4K|4.0|As a fan of Bob Dylan's music, I am not going to analyse him or this documentary piece by piece. He can be (or pretend to be) whoever he wants to be, it doesn't matter to me.  <br /> <br />I wanted insight into how he created his music and where he came from, and I believe I gained it by watching this documentary. Bob avoids answering anything concretely in the interview portions of this documentary and remains as elusive as ever, but that does not mean you will not learn anything about the man. This is a time capsule of sorts, showcasing various moments in his early career. <br /> <br />I think this documentary does an adequate job of telling the story of a man who wishes to remain mysterious. And that's all.
1400034779|5.0|Personally, I'm not a mystery fan, and I only read this at the urging of a friend. Imagine my surprise when a book I thought was about English ladies meeting in a parlor over tea to solve crimes turned out to be about a African folk hero and role model to women everywhere (who just happens to solve mysteries, in addition to fixing her friends lives, and running her business, and helping her community). To recount the pure joy of reading this book, I would have to cut and paste every line into my review. So what are you waiting for? This is a true gem not to be missed by readers of all ages! My high school sister, my mother, and my grandmother all adored the tales. I also highly recommend this as a book club selection (the Today show never disappoints with their selections).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent series.  Characters have history and depth.  Never understood why the series only ran for one season and was cancelled.
B000002ITW|5.0|A classic.  IMO, Young rounds out CSN.  CSN whimpers without his presence.  The others are great in their own right. Young simply adds the needed edge. <br /> <br />If you are a fan, buy this to hear them at their best (live.)  If you are not a fan, you owe them another listen.
0060574216|5.0|I recently read this book and is now going into a relationship.  I have to say not everything in this book is entirely valid for every case.  It oversimplified some matters and makes the assumption that the couple is a in a healthy relationship with no financial troubles, no family issues and no obstacles besides communication problems.  Under that assumption, this book is a great book for you because it makes us understand the most fundamental thing: Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.  Guys and girls are just different even though they maybe loving each other alot.   <br /> <br />One of the main things I got from this book is communication.  I think the key to any relationship is a healthy communication channel.  I read many books on relationships and communication is the most commonly agreed on factor.  (Others may say Money, Power and what not, but lets leave those out).  This book talks a great deal on guys see things, how girl see things.  This can help you alot when you have trouble communication with your partner or understanding her point of view.  Sometimes an argument pops out due to a misunderstanding of the meaning of words by a couple.   <br /> <br />Other chapters deal with how to influence your partner, how to understand men and womens behavior and their way of doing things.  These are great to understand a healthy relationship.   <br /> <br />I recommend this book to everyone and especially young couples.  This book can help you develop a better communication technique and understanding of your partner.

0224071262|5.0|With previous reviewers leaving comments such as \\"It involves a Chinese person who did *not* experience the cultural revolution write a book on the cultural revolution and claim what he wants to claim and make up facts to support his argument.\\" It appears the author, Jung Chang, is misunderstood.  First of all, she is not a he, Chang is a woman.  Secondly, being the daughter of high ranking communist officials, she experienced the the cultural revolution first hand. <br /> <br />I would advise anyone intending on reading this book to first read the author's previous book, Wild Swans.  In addition to being one of the greatest books I have ever read, it will give you information on the Jung Chang's background and her experiences growing up during the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.  After reading Wild Swans you will understand why she does not hold Chairman Mao in great esteem
B0009I7O7U|5.0|I am one of those who tends to listen to one song 20 times in a row if I am moved by the lyrics, melody, or message.  This album was a 20 times in a rower if I ever heard one...the problem was, there were at least 3 songs that I couldn't press the forward button on...just repeat!  I had to drive an extra loop on the 101N to keep it going..... <br />I wish I could give it more than 5 stars...this is the work of a musicial genius.
B000008M54|5.0|This cd is an authentical Folk Rock production! Great job! Great songs! I strongly recomend! Who likes Whaterboys or Folk Rock should try!
B000A0GP4K|1.0|If only the folks who made A Mighty Wind had been able to watch this self aggrandizing train-wreck for inspiration.  It is much stranger and even sometimes slightly funnier (especially when Joan Baez immitates Dylan and some guy dressed like Crocodile Dundee pontificates about his genius), but in the end it is little more than mire for wallowing in or fodder for satire.  The folkies come off as naive and self-centered, the rockers come off as sophomoric and insulated.    On the plus side, it was kind of fun (for an old fan) to see Dylan as a young man playing his electric guitar and braying into a microphone in front of a top notch combo of pop musicians, but after a while all the syrupy interviews and congratulatory tales of his genius and all the glances at his face peering out of the darkness pontificating about what amounts to marginalia at best, just get too tedious.  Shorten this movie to 87 minutes (most of it concert footage)and it might have been something  special, as it is... well, it beats A Mighty Wind (by about 2 1/2 hours).  If anyone needed further proof that Dylan was just a pop-star and Martin Scorcese was an over-rated one-note film maker, this is it.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|first and foremost i would like to tell all those mariah haters to get a life!!this cd is hit packed!!!!!from the first track to the last track is a true testimony to true talent.mariah is a true shinning star.not only  does she have the  most beautifull vioce i have ever heared she can write her own music.i wonder how this world would have been if  mariah had  decided to keep her voice to herself.she has touched so many lives including mine. i recomend this cd to anyone who loves good music from the soul. my favourites are we belong together,circles,fly like a bird and mine again and i can go on and on cause i truely love this cd!!!!!!!!.osiba
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The CD once you've already inserted it into your computer, as you already probably know, opens the little screen where you can play the songs etc etc. The screen also has an option to let you rip the songs to your harddrive. Really.. It's not that complicated. I don't see what everyone is complaining about. I haven't any trouble ripping/moving/burning anything.
0140072187|5.0|This is by far the best book about Vietnam ever written.  I really enjoy his sense of humor coupled with his cynicism.  Being in the military myself, I found this right at home.   <br />The other thing that impressed me, was how he was able to completely change the tone toward the end of the book.  You could feel when he had changed and would never be the same.  It's almost depressing.  However, this is still a great book, one I have read over and over and never grow tired of.
6305181772|3.0|I've never been able to understand the storyline to this movie, there are way too many twists & turns, but I don't even try to understand it anymore. It's still highly enjoyable, even if the storyline goes straight over my head. Mind you, most stuff does.<br /><br />I love this film, mainly cos it's Tom Cruise while he was still with Nicole Kidman (and now with Katie Holmes?!), and before he became more known for his 'love' of Scientology than anything else. He's a bit of a hunk in this one too. He's more in the press these days spouting stuff about Scientology, and jumping for joy about having to marry Katie Holmes. (He's probably going to have to teach her everything!)<br /><br />But back to the film. There's also a great cast of actors in this, including Tom, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Emilio Estevez (I only just realised who he was, he looks strange for some reason), Jon Voight, Emmanuelle B&eacute;art (doesn't she have gorgeous hair?), Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and Vanessa Redgrave. Emilio was cast in the role of Jack Harmon to create a sense of shock in the audience when he died early in the film. The film makers felt that casting a well-known actor in the role would increase the impact of Jack Harmon's death. And what a death it was! I still have to look away, despite having watched this many times (including when I had it on video *gulp*)<br /><br />There's lots of amazing scenes in this, the most amazing of all is the scene where Tom drops from the ceiling and hovers inches above the ground, his head kept hitting the floor until he got the idea to put coins in his shoes for balance.<br /><br />I love the little \\"are they, aren't they?\\" subplot between Tom's character Ethan & Emmanuelle's character. Do not covet thy neighbour's wife. But there's definitely a few scenes which were probably cut, leading to much more of a relationship between them, rather than what was left in the film, with stolen glances and that's about it! It never goes much further than a chaste kiss.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this film. It starts straight away, rather than stopping first at the menu page. Will there ever be a special edition do you think? I hope so at some point. Knowing my luck since I just bought it, one will get announced.<br /><br />I don't remember the second Mission Impossible being as memorable as this one, but I've seen this one many times, whereas I only watched Mission Impossible II once.kiss. <br /> <br />There's not much else I can say about this film.

6305433909|3.0|Does anyone watch these kinda films for the storyline? No, cos you know the storyline isn't going to be that great. Obviously you watch the film for the terrific songs, and terrific voices - although some of the singers aren't really singing!<br /><br />I love both Sister Act movies, but purely for the songs. There's a slightly better storyline to the first one, but both films have great characters, and actors. Hands up who loves Maggie Smith? Whoopi is alright, but Lauryn Hill is kinda wooden in this I thought. She's better at singing than acting. Look out for Jennifer \\"Love\\" Hewitt (that's how she's credited) too, as a very made up student, who always seems to be missing from the dance numbers!<br /><br />This movie will always have its critics, but it's a terrific, light hearted, ball of fluff, which won't harm or offend anyone. I like it. That's all that matters isn't it?<br /><br />But it's still not worth 5 stars, like most reviewers on here.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I think this is their best album yet. The songs are such a great mix of different styles and influences.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|I had this DVD on my wishlist for a while before I bought it. I was in two minds about getting it because, although I love the story of Peter Pan, but I wasn't sure how a film about how J.M. Barrie was inspired to write Peter Pan would be.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />By the end of this film, I was in tears, and that's mighty embarrassing. Even my dad shed a little tear - something he still denies. It's a very powerful film, and totally sucks you in. It leaves you in a state of shock, wonder and numb all at the same time.<br /><br />Johnny Depp was absolutely fabulous (as always) as a very suave J.M. Barrie and his Scottish accent (coming from a Scot) was flawless. It sounded very strange when he first speaks, I didn't realise he was playing a Scot, so I jumped when he came out with the accent. He managed to perfect the accent, unlike some stars with different accents (anyone remember Keanu Reeves' fatal attempt at an English accent in that Dracula movie?) The gorgeous Kate Winslet was perfect as always, playing an English rose. I wasn't keen on the little kids, they seemed very bratty, and emotionless. Dustin Hoffman (who was also in Hook), was a fabulous, although underused addition to the movie. He lost the tip of a finger and performed one day of shooting on morphine (so that explains it!) And most extras wanted to shake his hand when they were entering the theatre. And look out for Mackenzie Crook stealing the two scenes he's in from under Johnny's nose. Also Kelly MacDonald playing Peter Pan towards the end.<br /><br />This film moves effortlessly from scene to scene, and I found myself getting more & more involved & lost in the story. This is one movie that will definitely stand the test of time. It was extremely interesting to see J.M. Barrie being \\"inspired\\" by the Davies children, with scenes which you will no doubt recognise from all the different versions of Peter Pan there have been.<br /><br />This is definitely a family movie, although I was quite shocked at the hints of paedophilia in the movie. I only noticed this was because about a week ago, I watched Happiness, and that was quite heavily featured. It is quite clearly hinted at, for adults, but obviously young children will not understand, and thank God.<br /><br />What was never explained is how the ordinary & boring Peter actually became Peter Pan. I've always wondered, and thought it might have been explained in the film, but unfortunately it wasn't.<br /><br />This is a film to be seen, especially if you love the story of Peter Pan, and look out for the wonderful Neverland which is shown near the end. But I will warn you, you will need tissues. Very much so. If you don't cry, you've got a heart of stone. It will definitely continue to be a favourite of mine for a long time. I'm glad I went with my gut instinct and bought it.hough I was quite shocked at the hints of paedophilia in the movie.

B00005V9HH|5.0|I must confess, I put off seeing this film for sometime, just because of the title. When someone finally lent me a copy during a spare moment, I reluctantly watched it. Wow! What a great film. To have missed this one would have been such a great loss indeed. It's one on the best films ever made. It's also a film that stays with you. Long after you leave it, the plot twists and \\"what ifs\\" spin around in your head. And finally if you think about it, you get it. None of it happened. The finest line from the film sums it all up. \\"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\\" This is an intelligent movie for people who appreciate a feast, and after, you're left with dessert. It's a game played well. Great fodder for debate. Brilliant.    Fine performances from all involved, especially Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne and Director Bryan Singer. Great screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie.
0684833395|5.0|I read this book this spring, and it is now one of my favorite novels. The language is challenging, but not flashy. The story is rich, full of wit, humor, loss, friendship, hope, and triumph. I recommend this book to everyone.

I have a friend I travel around with in her car... this is the one sure-fire recording we can both enjoy on our travels!  Carlos makes me dance in my seat!  I don't know from jazz/fusion/latino/pop/rock/etc.  I just know this CD rocks my world.  It makes this fat girl want to get up and dance!
B000A2XC1C|5.0|This is the best christmas movie ever. The first time I watch it I was 7 years old. And now (23 years old) I still love it.<br /><br />Everybody should have this dvd for christmas..
B0002OERI0|2.0|2 1/2 ,I saw Greenday Play many years ago ( 1991) they opened <br />for some local bands I was into and at the time <br />I thought they were pretty good. I saw them again <br />the next year ( they headlined) and thought they were better,but they really never <br /> impressed enough to follow their career. here we <br />are almost 15 years later and greenday is still playing <br />(although FAR more popular. that first time i saw them  <br />there was maybe 50 people there) yet their music hasn't <br />really progressed much ( are they lazy? maybe high, hence the name.) there were alot of bands in the early ninties that played this exact style of pop/punk I just think this band decided to stick it out a little longer than the others,which obviously paid off. but as far as this group and album, up for as much ass kissing praise that it has received with such a worn out,overblown,down-troddin' genre of music just proves that it must have been a really slow year in the music buisness/grammys. <br />

You should rent or even buy this classic movie!!!!!
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|these guys sound like the \\"plugged-in\\" <br />Violent Femmes. everything sounds very familiar,but at <br />the same time not-to awful either. pick these <br />guys up if your curious looking for somthing new, <br />otherwise there are hundreds of bands past and present <br />that have already mined this territory, only they didn't <br />have the same \\"visual\\" style as f.f. that's the only diff.
B00005MP58|5.0|Absolutely outstanding, definitive dramatic version of P & P. Such a pleasure to watch that it is hard to break off before the whole 4 1/2 hours are done -- and even then it is tempting to start again.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|If you have never heard this album and are curious I can say nothing new that has not already been said a million times. just buy it and you too will see the light. and pay no mind to the squares that give it one star,their just upset because in '79 their next door neighbors came home and blasted this through the walls of their apartment while they were trying to listen to the new ELO album and it made their needle skip and scratch their record.
0385338686|2.0|Enjoyed the shopaholics, but this struck me as not fully developed.  The characters are not properly fleshed out.  I am a lawyer and find her stupidity not believeable.  With access to the internet, any intelligent person would download instructions for any household appliance or recipe.  Similarly, if she had the firm by the neck at the end, why didn't she negotiate a half-time position with an office in the country, even forgoing \\"equity partnership\\" to get it.   Anyway, a firm like that would NOT take someone back no matter the mistake, if she had run away in the manner of the heroine here.  Maybe they would have offered her a cash settlement, but take her back, no way.The premise was cute, but the characters were flat and the particulars of the story did not ring true.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Hey \\"19thnervousbreakdown\\": get over it. Many up and comers come to amazon & talk about a cd or book (try searchin for jewel and findin folkz with books promoting theirs as well as reviewing the book) or whateva. i reade the review u blatanly put down becuz of self-promotion and egotism & didnt think that at all. contrary, i think that he was just statin that hes also a performer and that he admires josh groban as the \\"only male singer i like\\". it was a fair and just review made by the kid, for the love of Pete! theres only one sentence that talks about him as a singer & it helped span the review's contents (he just said that hes a singer too and josh is the only guy he likes). so get over it. no body wants to hear ur crap. this place isnt to diss reviewers either. <br /> <br />Closer is a great cd. i agree that it has its boring parts, but so did Josh Groban's first too. u haveta admire that style of music to appreciate Josh Groban. heck, a lot of folks dont know who he is! he is good, though, and Closer is a good album except for some boring classical tunes u have to be trained in i think to appreciate fully.

If you are reading this you will be fan.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I love Veronica Mars. I started watching after the 5th episode and caught up during the reruns. I like almost every episode. It seems that I'm really hooked on eps 16-22. They are just great. The second season has gotten off to a great start but I won't spoil anyone! If you are curious about Veronica Mars, I suggest that you get the dvd. You will not be sorry. I know that I will tear into it once I get it. I'm dying to see the extras!!! Hopefully, a lot of Francis Capra. He is so hot!!!
0385338686|5.0|This is a cute book, although I intended to give it to my 12 year old daughter, I think I will wait till she is a little older.  I would recommend this book to young women looking for a easy lite read.  I usually read books that involve a mysterious murder but this one was a nice change of pace.  I have moved on to read Confessions of a shopaholic - which is also cute!
0792846443|4.0|Novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan)just crashed his car on a snowy New England road. Who comes to his aid? Annie Wilkes, his \\"number one fan\\", and former nurse. Annie is obsessed with Paul's fictitious character, Misery Chastain, from his best selling novels. Annie even names her pet pig Misery.  <br />But when Paul wakes up in Annie's home instead of in a hospital, suspicions start to mount. Then after Annie makes Paul burn his manuscript, he knows she's unstable. But the fun part is watching Paul beat the crap out of Annie at the end. If I had to endure all that pain from her, I'd beat the crap out of her too! <br />The acting was superb, but my only complaint was on the DVD they didn't leave the deleted scenes in. I read when the movie came out there were a lot of scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. Why aren't they on the DVD? I want to see the lawnmower & the foot chopping scene!!! If MGM re-releases this on Widescreen they absolutely MUST include the deleted scenes!!!!!
B0007ZIYWY|5.0|Goo is one of my favorite albums of all time. When this album came out it was so far ahead of its time.  The new remastered version sounds amazing.  I really loved all of the extra stuff like the demo songs and the collectors booklet.  If you do not have this album you should and if you only have the original version, the extras make the deluxe edition a great addition.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It is hard to pick the best album by Coldplay because they are all very good. the thing with X&Y is that this one is probably the most constant as far as high level of album tracks is concerned. With previous releases there are many songs I could listen to non-stop, but there are few that I usually skip. In the case of X&Y, there is virtually no track that lacks the quality of others. Each one \\"has something to offer,\\" although I have several favorites. I break this album down like this: <br /> <br />* I am addicted to (5 stars): <br />- Fix You <br />- Low <br />- Speed Of Sound <br />- Square One <br />- Swallowed In The Sea <br />- Talk <br />- The Hardest Part <br />- White Shadows <br /> <br />* I enjoy a lot (4.5 stars): <br />- A Message <br />- What If <br />- X & Y <br /> <br />* I listen to those less often, but they are still good (4 stars): <br />- Till Kingdom Come <br />- Twisted Logic <br /> <br />If you're looking for a great album to buy, either for yourself or as a gift, get his one, you won't be disappointed [unless of course you don't like this type of music, but then you probably wouldn't be reading this review :)]. <br />
B0007CNXUU|3.0|To be honest, I couldn't get into this at first.  It did take some time, but I kept perservering because I had heard that it was excellent.  I agree that it was good but not excellent.  I did shed a tear or two though, and the main little boy was amazing.  He's so talented beyond his years.  He'll do many big movies to come.  As for Johnny Depp - he was very good and so was Kate Winslet.  Yes I liked this, but just not as much as anyone else.  Out of 10 I'd give it a 6.
B00000JZIK|5.0|It's awesome, pure genius. Not only does it boast a great cast like Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Spacey, and Kevin Pollak, it's just a fine script with terrific acting. It kept me on the edge of my seat and oddly enough it STILL does. And the music is haunting and eerie..it adds to the movie, perfectly done. Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the finest actors EVER to grace the silver screen. His diversity in roles is just amazing. This film couldn't have been done without his acting genius!!
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|...but shallow and embarrassing as a love story.<br /><br />In the book, \\"Titanic and the Making of James Cameron\\" by Paula Parisi, James Cameron pitches his massive Titanic project to superstar Leonardo DiCaprio and allows him to read his script.  DiCaprio expresses reservations about the story and \\"bad\\" dialogue, and Cameron assures him that they can work out those problems in rehearsal.  DiCaprio signs on...and then is disillusioned when Cameron rejects any developing of the script.<br /><br />\\"I wrote it--there's nothing wrong with it!\\" Cameron snaps.<br /><br />Cameron is so certain that there's nothing wrong with his love story that, after the film is released, he demands that the L.A. Times fire its movie critic when he pans the lame love story.<br /><br />But the love story is lame.  The characters are thin and brushed with very broad strokes.  In my memory of the movie, Billy Zane's dastardly character wears a long moustache and stovepipe hat like Snidely Whiplash.  And I prefered Cherie Oteri playing the old lady in the Saturday Night Live parody instead of Gloria Stuart--but, again, it had more to do with the script than the actor.<br /><br />The whole class thing is beat to death (and handled better and much more succinctly in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER).<br /><br />The chase through the sinking ship with gunplay is silly and detracts from the epic tragedy going on above deck.<br /><br />But TITANIC is without a doubt a triumph of filmmaking and production design.  The wreck and sinking of the ship are sensational, and I will buy this new special edition just for those reasons.<br /><br />And it took a forceful, dynamic filmmaker like James Cameron to pull this off.  He deserved the Oscar.<br /><br />I just wish he would've collaborated with someone on the romantic parts of the story.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|For those who own the first cd and are used to the \\"30secondstomars\\" sound, you're in for a surprise. I knew that this cd would be different, the band even said that they didn't want to re-create the first cd. I was almost disappointed after the first listen, initially only liking 5 of the 12 songs. After playing it again, the other 7 grew on me. You just have to get over the initial shock of a whole new sound. Jared's voice is stronger and more passionate. It is a very enjoyable cd and would encourage anyone to give it a listen.

How does your net worth compare to the many successful Kiyosaki students? <br /> <br />Less than 2% of people in America are doing well.

0440237688|4.0|Perfect. <br /> <br />Can you imagine a life that's perfect?  <br /> <br />Well, that is how life is in Jonas's world. Welcome to the Community; A place with no color, crime, free will, individuality or pain; a place where your life is picked out for you by someone else and public apologies must constantly be given for even the smallest thing; a place that's...perfect. Or so that's what Jonas thought until he learned that his role in the Community was to be The Receiver. His job is to receive all of the world's memories and emotion from The Giver. With this job lies a heavy responsibility on young Jonas who must now deal with knowing about war, pain, love and heartache while the rest of his world doesn't. <br /> <br />With thought provoking issues and detailed descriptions, I would reccomend this book to any reader who likes thiking outside of the box.
B000089CJI|5.0|This album was a delight for me. I stumbled on this one while going through a stack of music and it took 2 listens before it hit me. Immediately as I began to immerse myself in the carefuly crafted, lush electro-analog soundscapes, it brought me back to my mid-college days when I was just discovering bands such as James, Underworld, Luna, Orbital, Slowdive, Spiritualized and Art of Noise. These were the good 'ol days for me, touchstones for the future.<br /><br />This album is loaded with really nicely composed pieces with lots of little details and subtle changes which can be really delightful. I also like the fact that the more upbeat, charging pieces are not overbearing or loaded one way or another with electronic or analog parts. Also, transitions from slow to fast midway through songs are quite uplifting and delightful. I find the slower pieces to be very emotional and evocative of the lyrical matter in the song.<br /><br />I couldn't really put a finger on favorites in this album. I really feel like each track has merit toward the whole of the piece being really enjoyable. One track that stands out to my nostalgic side is \\"Recycled Air\\" which paints a picture of longing and lonliness in the confined space of an aircraft cabin. Lush, sweeping synths in the background and slow, heavy, quiet voice brings you along the current. Just dreamy.
B000002540|5.0|This has to be one, if not the, greatest live Rock and Roll Album of all time.  \\"ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR KNEES, Here they are from New York City, The Amazing Blue Oyster Cult!\\"  And the album follows suit!!!!!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac, created during the same session times as Kid A. This isn't a B sides of Kid A though, this is a whole 'nother ball game. As the band describes it, Kid A is looking at the fire, Amnesiac is like being right in the middle of it. Amnesiac is their most daring CD where they experiment more with sound then they have done before. It's so crazy, that even the most die hard Radiohead fans might be put off. This album though contains some of the best Radiohead songs ever.<br /><br />Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box 4/5<br /><br />In classic Radiohead form the first song has a slow start and an instant build up. A great way to open up the album. It's very upbeat and gets your head bobbing a little bit. This song does a great job of getting your feet dabbed into the water, it's more electronic noise then they normally do, but they use just enough that it doesn't totally shock you<br /><br />Pyramid Song 5/5<br /><br />This is probably the most traditional Radiohead song on the album. Very soft Piano and Vocals, ever so slight build up in total Radiohead fashion. It is interesting to find that the Piano and the Drums are the theme instruments in this song giving it a different kind of sound. Can almost garuntee taht no matter what you think of the rest of the album, you will at least like this one<br /><br />Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors 3/5<br /><br />WTF mates. This song sort of throws of your groove. In the mash of electronic sound are Thom's lyrics. They are so heavily distorted though it's extremely hard to tell what he is saying. I think the song by itself isn't bad at all, and the electronic noises send you into an almost trance, but it really stunts your flow in the CD. Probably my least favorite on the album<br /><br />You And Whose Army? 5/5<br /><br />Luckily this song gets you right back into the CD with Thom's voice slightly muffled almost like it's coming over a static Radio. Another classic Radiohead build up song combining once again the Piano and Drums. You would think using this combination again would eb repetative but Radiohead manages to get a totally different feel to this song. A great way to get you back into the CD after the halt of Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors<br /><br />I Might Be Wrong 5/5<br /><br />Is it? Can it be? IT'S A GUITAR! Basically no hint of Guitar on the CD until this. The whole song is based around this awesome guitar riff that gets you bobbing in your seat. It sort of mixes old Radiohead and New Radiohead together in just an awesome fusion. Hearing a guitar is a nice relief to the CD keeping you excited and not getting tired of the electronic beats<br /><br />Knives Out 6/5<br /><br />Amazing. Just an amazing song. The whole song almost feels like a climx. It's strange, but you just feel like you jumped in the middle of the song right when the high point of the build up comes, but instead, the whole song is the build up. This also has a very hypnotizing sound to it, but in a better way then Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors. So might think it's repetitive, but I love it<br /><br />Morning Bell/Amnesiac 4/5<br /><br />For those of you who have listened to Kid A know the classic Morning Bell. This is basically the Morning Bell lyrics, with a totally electronic beat in the background. Suprisingly it's not bad at all. I like the original more, but it's neat to hear a different take on their own song.<br /><br />Dollars & Cents 5/5<br /><br />This song is so strange. The instrument that really gives this song it's soul are the Violins. This is a great song to just totally spin your head around and give you a totally different sound then the rest of the album. I guess it's sort of similar to Knives Out in the sense that both feel like you jsut jump into the climax, but the violins give this a totally different vibe<br /><br />Hunting Bears 4/5<br /><br />This completely instrumental piece involving the guitar and electronic is very neat. This doesn't stop your flow through the CD quite as much as Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors, but it does give you a yellow light. It has a really cool lengthy guitar riff mixed with some interesting electronic sound. I think this is a much better instrumental piece then a previous Radiohead attempt, Treefingers<br /><br />Like Spinning Plates 4/5<br /><br />A very heavy electronic song that literally makes you feel like your spinning. It's so strange, but the constant reverse, forward thing they do gives it a very cool sound. This is basically the last time they use electronic noises on the CD, and is a great way to say good-bye to it almost in the album. And Of course, a great Radiohead build up<br /><br />Life In A Glass House 7/5<br /><br />This is my personal favorite Radiohead song of all time. This song will make you feel like you are in a 30's noir detective movie. The Jazz band, and Thom's dreary voice give an amazing sound to the CD. Radiohead loves making perfect ending songs, and this truly gets that feeling dead on. Any Radiohead fan will come to know and adore this song to death. It's so neat to them do something totally insane like this, sounding nothing like them at all. A truly great way to end a great album<br /><br />Sp, my basic sum up is besides Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors ruining your starting flow into the CD, this is about as good as it gets folks. It takes a few times listening to it to totally get used to it, but I can almost garunttee you Radiohead fans out there will love it. Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did, and if you do buy it, enjoy listening from inside the Fire<br /><br />Dakotat it does give you a yellow light.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is a FINE album! Several songs are fantastic from the first listen, and a few others warm with repeated listens. Buy this album for songs like 'The Painter', 'This Old Guitar', and the beautiful 'Falling Off the Face of the Earth'. 'When God Made Me' is another great song that you will warm to with a few listenings.

B000002UAX|5.0|Say what you want, this album is perfect imperfection.  Ecclectic, over the top, self indulgent as it may be- an absolutely brilliant work.  This album contains many style parodies, however the Beatles pull them off better than most of the artists they emulate.  With the exception of a few songs, this album sounds like they are having fun with song writing, and not trying to take it too seriously.  Yeah some of the songs come off campy and sing along because of it, but that is the point, the beatles were tired of fans/critics looking for the meaning of life in their songs.  So they wrote a raw, unproduced album full of just good tunes with good melodies. <br /> <br />This is the album that made me start playing instruments again.

B00079ZACM|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and felt it was better than the remake.  Both this one and the new one hold to a very similar story line.
0465011020|5.0|I have spent quite a bit of time in South Korea this year, and have had discussions with people about reunification. South Koreans see this as absolutely inevitable.  I had suggested that there would be great difficulties because the people in the North are living in a primitive and medieval lifestyle.  South Korea is a completely modern country, and people from the North will have a hard time integrating.  Reunification in Germany was difficult because of the different viewpoints of those raised in communist systems.  The South Koreans dismiss this and say, \\"It is one people.\\"  After reading this book, I agree with them.  The North Koreans sound just like the South Koreans I know.  When the time comes, Korean reunification will likely be swift and result in far fewer problems than the German reunification. <br /> <br />The description of life in a concentration camp for a young child is stunning.  In spite of the harshness of the guards, the death and despair all around, the author still had moments of joy and saw beauty in his surroundings. <br />
B00005RFQ5|1.0|I bought this album unheard because I was such a fan of Prince.  Bad move.  I agree with the last reviewer.  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But, there is nothing on here worth listening to, let alone dancing to.  The subject matter didn't bother me (he's certainly been controversial before), but I listened to the entire album straight through and couldn't tell where one song began and another ended.  Bored now.  Only buy this if you're a completist.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Most of the other reviews here say it all - beautiful, haunting and one of the greatest rock albums ever made. It's incredible...
0399226907|5.0|I originally got this book as a gift when my son was 3 months old.  He loves reading this book especially, with the pictures of the food that the caterpillar eats and the holes in the pages of the food.  The board book is great!  He is now 2 1/2 years old and the board book was getting worned down.  I had to tape it back and I also bought a new one for him.  One for the car and one for at home.  He loves reading that \\"On monday, he ate through one apple, on tuesday, he ater through 2 pears... etc\\"<br /><br />It's a great book...very colorful!
B00005J6UP|5.0|All I have to say is this is a great film , its fun from the beging to the end
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Stargate Atlantis is a breath of fresh air for the stargate franchise, which, for me jumped the shark with the removal of Daniel Jackson and never got back on it. <br /> <br />Atlantis is brilliant well scripted and acted and incredibly funny at times with the best sci-fi villains ever and the coolest cast. <br /> <br />Moving the program away from earth and into the pegasus galaxy was a brilliant idea allowing the program to develop its own identity away from earth whilst retaining the integrity of the Stargate universe. <br /> <br />Well worth a watch and am waiting eagerly for season 2 to air in England. <br /> <br />Buy it, you'll love it.
B00004VVNB|5.0|This is sooo 70's, it is soo cute, you MUST JUST LOVE it. I can't say else.<br /><br />The dvd is a good one, double-sided with full screen (I hate full-screen) and wide screen (that's how this film is meant to be seen!!!), featurette and staff comment. What do you need more? Perhaps \\"Silent Running\\" but that's another story...
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Like all of you, I love this movie, It's my favorite movie, Ive been waiting for a collectors edition to come out for a while now, But from reading details about this release it does not seem like all that much extra stuff! No audio commentary? No deleted scenes? Not going to mention about all the Lebowski festivals or enourmous fan following this movie has? Oh well since it is my favorite movie ever Ill probably still buy it. But it better be worth it!
0321127420|5.0|As a software developer, the problem space for an application is quite different in the Enterprise than it is for a small domain. This being stated (and is in the book), Mr. Fowler quickly points us to effective patterns to be used for developing enterprise applications. Like the Gang of Four book, this book is a catalog and a good description of the patterns to be used in this space. Mr. Fowler has long been a guru in software engineering and this book clearly shows why. The text is very well written, easy to follow, and indicative of someone who knows what they are talking about, not only from a clear thought process, but from experience as well. This should clearly be a book that sits along with the Gang of Four book on your shelf (Design Patterns) for the Enterprise developer or someone interested in enterprise development.
0140177396|3.0|Review <br /> <br />The play novelette \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck deals with two farm hands, named George and Lennie who are trying to realize their personal American Dream. Since the Great Depression influences all parts of society, economy and the everday life circumstances are quite difficult for them.  <br /> <br />Firstly you have to mention that Steinbeck seems to be crazy about details. The very beginning of each chapter is decribed up to the smallest thing consequently the reader gets a good impression where the action takes place. Otherwise his description sometimes seem to be exaggerated and a special background knowlegde is necessary to understand his hidden evidences. Anyways the language Steinbeck's character use is quite pleasant to read if you like American English. Due to this language the character seem to be pretty realistic furthermore it gives the reader a good opportunity  to get along with the story in general. Moreover Steinbeck created a lot of different characters, with a lot of different attiudes in addition to that a lot of trouble makes the reader turn to the next page and go on with reading. This mentioned trouble also leads to the end when George kills his best friend Lennie who is retarded. By the way this act compromises also an ethic question. Was this an act of euthanasia or just a cold blooded murder?  <br />Make your own impression and read the book but do not expect too much action otherwise you will be disappointed.  <br />  <br />
0201485672|5.0|There are a few books that a software engineer should own or at least have read and this is one of those. Martin Fowler (...) is ahead of his time usually and brings out some very informative, helpful experience to working with code. Working with legacy code, developing new code and realizing it must change are times when a good book like this will be saver. Not only does this book provide some specific how-to, but it establishes guidelines on refactoring and identifies areas where refactoring is probable.
0739321870|5.0|Hawking's classic text really comes alive and is revitalized in this audio version. I listened to the audio book of Brian Greene's \\"Fabric of the Cosmos\\" a couple of months ago, and funny enough, I ended up getting Hawking's \\"Briefer History\\" on audio CD and its the same narrator, Erik Davies. As anyone knows who listens to audio books alot, you had better REALLY like the narrator's style and voice, otherwise no matter how good the original text is, its just going to annoy you. Davies' voice and style keep up the energy and tempo of the text that keeps the reader engaged, which is a challange when listening to audio books than are non-narrative. I certainly recommend this audio version - it won't bore. I see also that Davies' has narrated novels like Tami Hoag's \\"Kill the messenger.\\" Those types of novels are not usually my thing, but I am thinking of getting it just because I like Erik Davies' voice!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Quirky, fun, futuristic and a touch of the old west!  I loved this series!! This is a prelude to the new movie Serenity and you really should see these DVDs to get a full background on the characters.  Definately good entertainment!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great show with a great cast, interesting and varied sub-plots, a great blend of chivalry, action and comedy and most importantly, it doesn't insult your intelligence. Sci-Fi meets the old West, spaceships and six-shooters. Sounds strange but it works. <br />I missed Firefly when it originally aired. I caught a couple of episodes on the Sci-Fi channel recently and I really started getting into the show. I just bought the DVD boxed set and have been watching all the episodes with my family.  <br /> <br />They just got everything right,(well almost everything, did they really need a resident prostitute? I have to keep my hand ready on the remote to skip some of the racier scenes for my kids' sake) from the opening theme to the interesting cast members. Just about every crewmember aboard Firefly has some kind of mysterious past and they are all thrown together on one small ship sharing adventure. I've only seen about half of the episodes so far and I'm hooked. If you like space opera with great cast chemistry (think ST:TOS, early Stargate:SG1, even season 2 Stargate:Atlantis) you owe it to yourself to check this show out. <br />I was saddened to learn that it was canceled before its first season ended. It would be great if Sci-Fi picked it up. I hope the movie does well.  <br /> <br />I look forward to seeing Serenity in the theatre.
B000002H6C|5.0|First time I saw them in consert was with this album tour. Had been a fan for a number of years. Tookm my best friend to the show and we had a killer time.
B000296P2G|3.0|This DVD comes in a pack like those \\"dollar\\" DVD's. It says it was digitally remastered. Nope. Image is dark, lack-luster, color ain't real great.
B000002H33|5.0|Killer disk. Had when I was a teenager. Have had to re-add to my collection. Grew up on them. They were a local band for me.
1591840562|5.0|I love this book. If there's an enterpreneur somewhere, sleeping inside you, this book is going to ring the alarm bell that wakes him up and get's him going.  <br />Guy Kawasaki has a great style of writing and a whole lot of experience worth sharing.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|Oasis have definitely come back from a slump. We all know Heathen Chemistry was horrendous, and coming into the new record, I was a bit apprehensive about it being as solid as the first three records (yeah, I said THREE, Be Here Now was good stuff). Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised at the versatility, yet also consistency in this album. Thankfully, Oasis have come into there own again as great song writers, and they STILL are great musicians. I really enjoyed the record, and how it brought back memories of the old days, while still not leaving me longing to pop in one of the old records in its place. It is a must-own for any Oasis fan.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|For true fans of pop culture and Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
B0006L5RT2|2.0|Processed-sounding and contrived.  Teenage girls will love the soul-searching lyrics that actually aren't soul-searching at all.  It might be interesting to get Mr Blunt out of the recording studio, take away the studio musicians, and see what happens.  There's some talent perhaps under the perfect-sounding sheen somewhere.  Buy The Velvet Underground instead.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Recommended because of its new features, namely the \\"Blooper Reel\\" and the \\"Wrap Party\\" which are both less than three minutes apiece, and I really wouldn't miss, but the keeper is the \\"L.A. Pretty Woman Tour\\" which takes you on a trip to the various filming locations in Los Angeles, narrated by Garry Marshall.  The best extra is Marshall's audio commentary which is updated from the 10th Anniversary edition.  If you know the movie very well, it's a welcome addition.<br /><br />Fortunately, you can skip the previews of other movies at the beginning of the disc by pressing the Menu button.<br /><br />The sound seems better on this disc than the earlier DVD.  It has a better loudness ratio so the music is not too loud compared to the dialog.  This is the Widescreen 1.85:1 version.<br /><br />Finally, I don't know why this film is rated \\"R\\".  There's virtually no nudity and they only curse three or four times during the whole movie.  PG-13 is more like it (which these days is \\"R-Lite\\" but oh well).<br /><br />Enjoy it!
068987474X|4.0|This book is very simple, and maybe a little too easy to read. The advice is practical and clear cut; very helpful when one is in the 'fog' of a breakup. It is written in a way that makes you laugh at yourself and your painful situation; definitely helps keep break-ups into perspective. Each chapter lists a different form of break-up excuses, eventually you reach one that matches your own situation, and you quickly identify with it. I think many give the author 'guru' like qualities he does not deserve, and the \\"he's just not into you\\" is quite repetitive, but that's the basic point. A great book, I am glad I read it, it did help.
B000A5044C|2.0|Supposedly based on fact, we have a irresponsible mother who has four children all from different fathers, and abandons their kids to persue another relationship (the mom even tells the eldest son she never mentioned her kids to him, and tells him he is being selfish not thinking of her happiness). She eventually never returns, and the four children are left to their own devices to stay alive. The eldest son visits his irresponsible dad needing money but explains he has none having to spend lots on his present girlfriend. Nice guy... <br /> <br />The only problem with this film is not once have the children cried or showed much emotions. You would think-even small kids, would miss their only parent. There are many times I thought the film dragged. None of the neighbors in the apartment noticed something funny going on--where's the mother? (in Japan living quarters are cramped and neighbors are very close by). The water and electricity was cut off. With four children in the apartment, wouldn't they notice the smell (none of the kids kept house clean-it was a pig sty in there).  <br /> <br />Even when one of the children had an accident, fell off a chair, and eventually died-not one sibling cried or even thought about getting help, which would be a natural reaction. They just sat around and watched her die. The eldest son put her body in a suitcase and buried it at some airport. mmmm this girl shows up near the end of the show--supposedly becomes friends with the eldest son, and she helps do the deed of burying sister's corpse. Personally I think this lack of emotion is appalling. Why didn't she tell the authorities when she seen how they lived? <br />  <br />An employee at a grocer asked the eldest son...\\"why haven't you called the authorities.\\" Eldest son replied he didn't want the family to be separated. I guess he preferred to watch his siblings live in dirt and filth, slowly starve to death, not get an education, and die off. ANd with the lack of emotion with allchidren when their sister died, it made me wonder how on earth this film won the 2004 Cannes International Film Festival award. <br /> <br /> <br />Also unrealistic is how did the eldest son pay rent-sure the mother sometimes (extremely rarely) sent money, and it goes fast with four kids. During one scene the landlord's (or his daughter, i forgot which) was asking for rent money. Then all of the sudden rent was no longer an issue. I don't care where you live--RENT IS NOT CHEAP. In real life the landlord would have started eviction procedures. Also the landlord said nothing of the trash and filth all over the apartment when she came to visit, and she CLEARLY seen how the apartment looks like.  A REAL landlord would have been livid. Eviction process.  <br /> <br />I know all the critics gave it rave reviews, but I'm telling you my honest opinion of the movie--it was slow, and far from realistic in the midst of child abandonment and how the children would react to that, and the general lack of pure emotion (nobody cried) impossible to grasp.  <br /> <br />This is NOT a movie I would want to see twice, but okay to rent. It was, to me, a so-so movie.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000065VA1|5.0|I don't like most songs that make the pop charts.  I don't like synthesizer-heavy arrangements.  I don't like \\"big\\" production. \\"So\\" has all of those, but boy do I love it! <br /> <br />The mid-80's were a dry period for rock, with acts like Madonna and Michael Jackson filling the airwaves. Then a \\"new\\" new wave came along with the likes of U2's \\"Joshua Tree,\\" Paul Simon's \\"Graceland,\\" Suzanne Vega's \\"Solitude Standing,\\" and \\"So,\\" and suddenly you could listen to the radio and not be ashamed.  \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"Sledgehammer\\" (and to a lesser extent \\"Big Time\\") made the most noise, but the fun doesn't stop there.  Also superb are \\"Red Rain,\\" \\"Don't Give Up,\\" and \\"Mercy Street.\\"  And the two tracks I haven't mentioned (3 on the reissue) are pretty good too. <br /> <br />I'm not sure what the story is with putting \\"In Your Eyes\\" in the final spot on the CD.  It's certainly worthy of that position as a nice rounding out of the album. Whatever.  Just takes some getting used to I guess. And Daniel Lanois' production is an acquired taste. It worked for U2 and Dylan, not so much here - but it doesn't spoil it either. The songwriting is just too strong. <br /> <br />\\"So\\" is definitely one of the top 10 albums of the 80's, and though some disagree, I'd say it's Gabriel's best.
B0000035E7|5.0|You see, Nirvana was originally not the Main Stream band it became with Nevermind.  It was purely underground before then, and Bleach proves it.<br /><br />This falls as my favorite in the Nirvana albums, which run like this:<br /><br />Bleach<br /><br />Incesticide<br /><br />In Utero<br /><br />With the Lights Out (Box Set w/ CD and DVD)<br /><br />MTV Live in New York<br /><br />From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah<br /><br />Nevermind<br /><br />Nirvana (The Greatest Hits Album)<br /><br />Bleach is an incredible debut album which shows the raw power of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana.  If you want a Nirvana collection, then you absolutely must start with Bleach.
B00005JL1C|4.0|This movies is another classic 80's masterpiece.  If you love the clothes, hair, and music from the 80's this is your movie.  A poor \\"Tomboy\\" is in-love with her best friend (boy), but he doesn't see her...only the most popular girl in school.  Like all 80's movies it has the typical classic ending.  You'll love this movie as much as you loved the 80's.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|This Batman was just as good as the first one.  However, it is much darker, sexier, and more mature than the first one.  Burton evidently had a lot more freedom with Batman Returns than he did with Batman.<br /><br />Catwoman is a looker (sorry... but yes... even moreso than the most recent Catwoman), and Danny Devito as the Penguin is absolutely incredible.  This Penguin is so much better than the original Penguin, and he is much more demented.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is just incredible, luscious, and downright inspiring.  It continues in the same vein as Batman, but, unfortunately, it was the end of the good half of the series.<br /><br />You see, after this one, the WB handed wanna-be director Joel Schumacher the reigns, and Batman died from there.  I have no problem understanding while Michael Keaton didn't do any more Batmans.
B00005JKOI|4.0|This movies is a classic.  It may not be Oscar material, but if you grew up in the 80's you'll appreciate everything it has to offer.  (i.e. the hair, clothes, and music)
B00005NB8K|5.0|Val Kilmer might as well be Jim Morrison reincarnate.  He was too good for the part.  It was beyond amazing... it was downright eerie.  From Jim's singing/talking voice, all the way to his maneurisms and his drug-addiction and his beliefs, and what he looked like... Val Kilmer got it all.  All I can say is, somehow,  JIM MORRISON WAS HAUNTING THIS FILM.<br /><br />Because of that, and because of the incredible supporting cast, really hot women, and the splended choice of songs used for the movie, The Doors is an amazing masterpiece about an incredible rock group.  I wish I had been alive in that time to truly see the Doors live instead of being forced to see their concerts on TV and on DVD.<br /><br />This DVD is an awesome bio-movie about the band, and about Jim Morrison.<br /><br />And about Val Kilmer... I had first seen Val Kilmer act as Batman in Batman Forever, and after that, I didn't think too highly of his acting skills.  It was an okay Batman, but he just didn't do that good.  But then I saw this movie, and I began looking at what else Val Kilmer has done, and I realized, it wasn't Val Kilmer who sucked in Batman Forever (It was just his bad luck that he had to read that particular script)... it was Robin and the mediocrity of the movie itself.  As I said above, it was eerie watching him play Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The DVD also has great features, a lot of Deleted Scenes that I think should be put back into the movie, and over-all is very worth-it.<br /><br />Now, an unrated one with all those Deleted Scenes put back in would be incredible.
B00012QM8G|5.0|<br /> <br /> <br />THE MOVIE:  The concept of the movie itself is very awesome.  How a German, not a German jew, a German turns out to save people's lives from the horrors of the holocaust.   <br /> <br /> <br />THE PROBLEM:  How ironic this may seem, There is a racist element going on here, it can be called a one sided element, a distortion of history, denial, etc, etc.  When people think of the Holocaust, they think of the persecution of the Jewish people - this is correct, this DID happen, 6 million of them and were Hitler's worst scapegoat to destroy.  BUT here is the catch, the \\"Holocaust\\"  IS NOT just the persecution of the Jewish people, there were NON-JEWISH people persecuted as well.  Most people know this as well, but it never seems to surface or be taught enough by holocaust institutions.  Usually, these instittuions are it seems to be run by Jewish people themselvs.  I work at a community college and in my buidling is a little Holocaust Museum, from what I see and heard the curator of the museum teach people is about the persection of the Jews, ONLY the jews.  In the museuem is about only the Jews who were persecuted.  This IS racism on the part of these Jewish people.  Jewish people can be racist you ask????  YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   They are people like anybody else, and they have all the human fallicies of other humans as well. Being a Jewish person DOES NOT make you free of racism or ignorance.  To think that way is totally obsurd.  There were Christians, Homosexuals, gypsies, Jehovah Witnesses, mentally and physcally handicapped, and slavs put in camps and suffered the SAME fate as the jewish people did, I DON'T see anything about them in the little Holocaust Museum where I work.  I see one sidedism here, I see a distortion of history and denial here.  And I see people who for their own ignorant reasons are doing the wrong thing morally.  Point being?  Many Jews who are in charge of this Holocaust movement, are racist people.  Promoting Jewish Supremacy in the sense of who was only persecuted.  The Holocaust isn't just the slaughter of Jewish people, contrary of what they want you to think, it's the slaughter of many people.  ANY Holocaust museum should have the truth of what happened, that is EVERYBODY that was persecuted.  Shame on these Jewish people who are just as bad as the Klansman next store.  If you want to e-mail me and talk about this review, any disagreements or whatever PLEASE e-mail me at: greatgeneralhannibal@lycos.com  I'll be glad to talk. My heart goes out to the Jewish people who died in the Holocaust AND to the non-Jewish people who died in the Holocaust.  No hate, only love.
B000003TA4|3.0|This is not their best album, and truthfully, my 3-Stars are only there because of In Bloom, Come as You Are, Polly, and Something in the Way.  This falls in #7 in My Nirvana Favorites:<br /><br />Bleach<br /><br />Incesticide<br /><br />In Utero<br /><br />With the Lights Out (Box Set w/ CD and DVD)<br /><br />MTV Live in New York<br /><br />From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah<br /><br />Nevermind<br /><br />Nirvana (The Greatest Hits Album)<br /><br />Smells Like Teen Spirit is NOT their greatest song (as many would like to believe), and true Nirvana connoiseurs know this.  It is a good song, but they have many, many better ones.  The main problem with this album is how Main Stream it is.  This is the album where Nirvana left the underground and went \\"MTV.\\"<br /><br />This must be included in your Nirvana collection solely because it is another studio recording.  No other reason exists to own it.  You will listen to it again and again, but not with as much fervor as, say, Bleach.  Get it so as to complete your collection.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Loved the ending in this movie.  This movie while not flawless, had intelligence.  It is the intelligense that made this movie.  Danny Glover played perhaps his worse role ever, lol.  There was nothing about this character that I liked. And he is a good actor but he just went cold in this part.  The other acting was good to me, people keep on complaining about Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannel.  COME ON! Lol, they weren't that bad at all folks!  So what if Cary Elwes has an accent and played in the princess bride, he is an ACTOR.  Actors play many parts, this is nothing new people and you should know this!  What makes a good actor is the variety of parts he/she can play, geez.  You \\"horror buffs\\" and \\"movie buffs\\" HAVE to know this or else throw out all your pride and knowledge of movies.  And also a note, this isn't the first serious role for Elwes in a thriller, Kiss the Girls comes to mind????  Back to Saw, Good movie, great ending, intelligent, good acting (exclude Glover). I see nothing wrong with this movie. Oh yes!  Another factor of people not liking this movie was beacuse of the comparisons to Se7en it seems.  If you have a mindset that it is going to be as good as se7en then you won't like Saw.  They are different movies, DON'T compare them.  See Saw as it's own entity, and you will have a better chance of liking it.  Can't wait for Saw 2, the madness looks doubled!
B000003TAR|5.0|The only reason this is third on my favorites list is because I discovered Incesticide:<br /><br />Bleach<br /><br />Incesticide<br /><br />In Utero<br /><br />With the Lights Out (Box Set w/ CD and DVD)<br /><br />MTV Live in New York<br /><br />From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah<br /><br />Nevermind<br /><br />Nirvana (The Greatest Hits Album)<br /><br />With no exceptions, Nirvana makes a powerful return to Underground Rock.  Granted, the scene is a little different and just a bit more melodious than it was when Bleach was released, but this album returns Nirvana to their underground glory.<br /><br />This album is a sad album, with lines like \\"Look on the bright side is suicide\\" (although Kobain was later noted to say that that line was there simply because it rhymed, so it had no actual meaning to it).  Sadness and death seems to be the overtone of thsi album, which is what helped to lead many to believe the verdict of suicide in his death, even with the hundreds of holes in that theory.<br /><br />However, this album is strewn with a power rarely scene in many Grunge and Rock albums.  In Utero is the next album to go with in your collection.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Chris Who?  What album was The Bleeding?  Neil Kernon combined with Cannibal Corpse - PRICELESS.  George \\"Corspegrinder\\" Fisher has never sounded better. And the rest of the crew comes along excellent.  This is the best Cannibal Corpse that I have ever heard.  Which to me means one thing:  This is Cannibal Corpse.  I love the Wretched Spawn, Technical death at it's best.  And man, is it just me? Or Does Fisher have a awesome killer scream.  I love it!  Pounding music with the brilliant finally coming together vocals of Corpsegrinder.  I read that Corpsegrinder was the best on Monstrosity, I heard their supposed masterpiece \\"millenium\\" and I thought it wasn't that good at all.  Corpsegrinder sounds the best I have ever heard him on The Wretched Spawn.  Millenium by Monstrosity? Please.  The Wretched Spawn Tramples over it like a herd of cows.  If you like Death Metal period, Get The Wretched Spawn by Cannibal Corpse.  Oh, and I know people have a problem with the content of the album and the band in general.  Yes, it is gore lyrics with torture and violence and everything groteque imaginable.  You can't take it seriously, the only thing I hear is Great, pounding metal.  Thanks Neil Kernon and Cannibal Corpse for such a cool album.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|...then this would be the best Batman of all time.<br /><br />Michael Keaton plays an incredible Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The \\"classic detective\\" atmosphere of the movie was awesome!  Kim Basinger plays a great Vicki Vale, and Jack Nicholson plays a very realistic, and quite scary, Joker (granted, it was the last good thing he had ever done).<br /><br />This was the movie that started it all, and was, in fact, the best, until Batman Begins came out (although that only beat this  Batman for first place by about 1/8 of a star). Tim Burton did an excellent job.  If all the original Batman's had followed in this vein, then there would have been no need to redo the Legacy.  But then, Batman Forever came out, and then, unfortunately, Batman and Robin...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|My first metal album was Slipknot's debut.  I got used to it and liked it. But, it was sloppy as well, and a very anti-everything album which isn't such a bad thing, but just not a very intelligent album the way they did it, lol.  Couldn't wait for Iowa.  HATED Iowa, very sloppy, not entertaining at all.  The band was at a downpoint anyway in the Iowa era.  With Vol 3, they have matured and became a cohesive unit.  This IS a band on this album. They have just upgraded in everyway.  Slipknot doesn't have talent?  Just hear this album.  Corey Taylor proves his worth as a vocalist on this album.  Even on the previous albums, I knew he was a great vocalist.  The guy has talent.  Vermillion pt. 2 is my favorite song.  I also like vermillion, pulse of the maggots, and tracks, 7,10, and 12.  The whole album is good.  I find no major complaints with it.  I'm proud of slipknot for this album, good job guys. And with the people that keep up with the annoying obession of calling this nu-metal.  PLEASE.  Nu-metal is dead guys, and slipknot has obviously gone past the nu-metal scene to be a solid, genuine band.  If you don't like slipknot because you can't get past the wall of ignorance in your brain that they are for mall kids and are nu-metal, what can I say?  I feel bad for you.  And maybe you just don't simply like their music period, which is fine - a much more rational reason for not liking them, lol.  And how could I forget the man behind this album, the man that CLEANED up slipknot and turned them into the band that they always had the potential to be.  The man that took this band from the evil clutches of the then nu-metal master producer, Ross Robinson. This man is RICK RUBIN, One of the best producers out there.  Just hear the debut and especially the worst Slipknot album in existence, Iowa and then hear Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses....uhhh yeah.  BIG difference.  Has Ross Robinson even produced any albums recently or has he been out of work because of the nu-metal scene vertially dead?  Rick Rubin is the man.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This Batman was, somehow, better than the original Batman with the Joker.<br /><br />The storyline of where Batman came from was absolutely incredible, and Christian Bale did amazing as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The part came alive with him as it had never done before.<br /><br />It seems that the producers aren't thinking about it, but I personally think they should redo the Batman Legacy with Christian Bale as Batman, and follow in the vain of Batman Begins, keeping Rachel Dawes as the Love Interest (I don't like the idea of the same guy ending up with different girls every few days... and each movie did not pan out over many years, so... while they were hot, I did not like the idea of the \\"Bat-Babes\\").  I would love to say how they do the Joker.  My two ideas for who could play the Joker are (in order of my best bet):<br /><br />Johnny Depp<br /><br />Jim Carrey<br /><br />Anyways... Batman Begins is the best Batman yet.  I hope they decide to make it the start of a new Batman series.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Some really good songs on this CD.  don't expect it to be as good as the first, however it is a must buy for anyone who really liked the first.  Excellent band live, too.
B000003TAB|5.0|...and it isn't even a studio recording.  This is a rarities and B-sides album that falls to #2 in my favorite Nirvana Albums:<br /><br />Bleach<br /><br />Incesticide<br /><br />In Utero<br /><br />With the Lights Out (Box Set w/ CD and DVD)<br /><br />MTV Live in New York<br /><br />From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah<br /><br />Nevermind<br /><br />Nirvana (The Greatest Hits Album)<br /><br />Incesticide gets a little Main Stream, yes, but it shows Nirvana's return to purely underground.  The (New Wave) Polly is absolutely incredible.  Sliver is one of a kind.  Downer is my favorite Nirvana song.  Hairspray Queen has a funky bass line, and is really incredible.<br /><br />This is the next must-get after Bleach.
B000AL730O|4.0|If your looking for transcendant McCartney slip on Revolver or Rubber Soul, but if a supple, mature effort from a great artist can hold your fascination then give Chaos and Creation a spin. Paul who has had a long and wildly inconsisitent solo career seems to entering a more rewarding, thoughtful  period begining with Driving Rain. While previous reviews have remarked (pro and con) on the melodic potency of this outing and the production quality, there's one area where Paul has clearly and wonderfully returned to form that I think merits attention: his singing. All too often over the last 30 years Paul's beautful voice has been marred by a self concious vocal approach--sometimes mannered and insincere, sometimes laboured and all too infrequently relaxed and masterful. Throughout Chaos & Creation McCartney evidences restraint, good taste, an ease with his full range, effective understatement and swing. For no other reason than the pleasure of hearing him sing really well again has this disc been in my player a lot. An A for effort, a B in exectution.
B00006V9A0|1.0|This was the first Nirvana Album I got, and I loved it then.  But then I got all the other Nirvana albums, and this collection suddenly sucked.  This is why it gets the consolation prize on my list:<br /><br />Bleach<br /><br />Incesticide<br /><br />In Utero<br /><br />With the Lights Out (Box Set w/ CD and DVD)<br /><br />MTV Live in New York<br /><br />From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah<br /><br />Nevermind<br /><br />Nirvana (The Greatest Hits Album)<br /><br />There are songs on here that could be replaced for better songs, and much, much more could be added.  These are all the mainstream songs Kurt wrote when he was feeling \\"Pop-ish.\\"  Only get this if you must have it, but it is not essential to your collection.
B000AXSN5G|1.0|I have been a rabid Neil Young fan for at least 35 years.  I was psyched to hear so many different reviews calling this his masterpiece.  Many comparing it to \\"harvest\\"  Please don't insult that album.  The best song on \\"Prarie Wind\\" would be the worst on \\"Harvest\\" , \\"After The Gold Rush\\", and several other more worthy Neil albums.   <br />I have 24 Neil Young cd's and albums.  Iwould not even rate this in his top fifteen.  This cd is overproduced and not the \\"rootsy\\" feeling that many reviews have been saying>
B000244EMO|5.0|The title says it all and this bargain buy didn't dissapoint.  Probably Arnie's best film.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Grease takes you back to the fifties when there were the gangs, the nerds, the students, the jocks, the bad girls, and the square ones. T-Bird member, lady-loving, sex-playful Danny (John Travolta) falls in love with goody-two-shoes Sandy (Oliva Newton-John). Opposites attract, you know. Towards the end, Sandy realizes that if they are to be together, then she must turn herself into a sexy bad girl, just right for her Danny. The movie, filled with great songs and dancing, clearly states the true fact that this was the period where conventionality was tossed aside, and teens were who they wanted to be, loved who they wanted to. This movie was just as entertaining as the classic musicals. One of my favorites!<br /><br />Grease is the word, it's got groove and it's got meaning.
0596007124|5.0|One of my favorite book bought this year~ <br /> <br />Great design pattern learning book for junior java programmers.
6305320802|5.0|This is one of the most charming and entertaining musicals of all time. I enjoyed the music and story as Curly and Jud fight over Laurey, who decides she wants Curly. And how Jud gets his reward for causing fear and war to break out with his relationships with Laurey and Curly, gets the price of his death taken out. But the whole picture over all is about the farmers and the cowmen and how they all got along in 1907 Oklahoma territory, when it was preparing for statehood. Five stars, one of the best movies of them all!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Sorry, no time for substance.  Cross Star Wars with  . . . something better, and elimiate the droids and Jedi and you get this.
B000001FDK|5.0|Grease was a excellently done production. And it has the best soundtrack of all soundtracks!!! Music today isn't the way it used to, and the tunes on this CD take you back to the rockin and rollin fifties where Travolta and Newton-John turn out to be good singers in these well-put together tunes.<br /><br />The cast knew that \\"You're The One That I Want\\" was going to be a hit. Indeed it was. It's my favorite track on the CD!!!<br /><br />I also enjoyed \\"Grease\\", \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\", \\"Sandy\\", \\"Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee\\" and the reprise, \\"Greased Lightnin'\\", \\"It's Raining On Prom Night\\", \\"Blue Moon\\", \\"Born To Hand Jive\\", \\"Mooning\\", \\"Freddy My Love\\", \\"Rock N Roll Party Queen\\", \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\" and \\"We Go Together\\". A wonderful soundtrack not to be missed! Five stars!<br /><br />And as the years get farther away from the days of the fifties, this CD will be there to bring teens of the future back to the days of \\"Rama lama lama ke ding a dinga dong\\"
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Neil tackles alot of subject matter here ,ecology,family (the loss of his father)9/11,the decline of our civilazation, a tribute to Elvis,a tribute to Hank Williams SR. in This Old Guitar which Neil somehow obtained, God in When God Made Me. the songs are more like After The Goldrush, Harvest Moon, Harvest and Old Ways. Neil recorded all of this shortly after discovering he had an anyeurism and prior to his surgery. So there is also a sense of immortality that weaves it self through the cd. There is not one single bad song.I listened to the whole  cd on his web site for weeks before it was released and bought it instantly when it came out.If you liked Comes A Time,Silver&Gold or any of the previous cds mention, you will love this one It simply beats them all.
B00000IP4H|3.0|Ok, this really only gets three stars due to pesonal preference. If you asked me to pinpoint a reason why this is my least favorite Testament album, I don't have one. The musicianship is solid, the songwriting is pretty decent, and Chuck Billy excellent as usual. The only specific complaint I can come up with is that Eric Peterson is not a good enough lead guitar player to stand on his own. But there is still some decent soloing here and there. Anyway, this is all and all a solid album with some face melting vox from Chuck Billy, some superb (though usually overshadowed by the crushing guitars) drumming from Gene Hoglan (what else would you expect from him?), and like I just implied, Eric Peterson's riffs are crushing. Strangely enough, Testament continue to drift in the opposite direction of most of their peers, getting heavier, less compromising, and less radio frinedly. Even 1994's Low is a lightweight album compared to this. In fact, like a lot of other people have already said, this is really a death metal album. It's almost like they had Trey Azagtoth and Allan West write the songs and then just edited them and played them the the way Testament plays. Which I think is why it took so long for me to get into this album at all. When  the bleakest album you've ever heard by another band is Pantera's Live 101 Proof, you are not ready for Demonic. Its a decent album, but unless you enjoy a bands like Morbid Angel you should leave this one on the shelf because this album is straight up Death Metal from start to finish.
0765340798|5.0|Excellent read.  Came upon this book and actually read it first.  I have now read the first book \\"Butlerian Jihad\\" and am finishing \\"The Machine Crusade\\".  Superb science fiction and engrossing story.  Definitely five stars for this.  The authors did an excellent job.  By the way I had also read the original Dune and these books lived up to its credibility.  There are a lot of extraneous stories that could be taken from these books and written into whole novels themselves.  I especially think the formation of the Cymeks was interesting and how they came to be.
020530902X|5.0|My Creative Writing teacher told the class about this book.  I still use it as a reference along with my thesaurus and dictionary.  There are no exercises in this book, only sound advice for every kind of writer.  The Elements of Style is easy to understand and so small it will fit in your purse or pocket.  What I really like about this book is that it doesn't blather on and on, it gets to the point quickly and efficiently.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve his or her writing style.
B00003RQNJ|4.0|I saw this movie when it came out and loved it.  It is a must see movie with fine performances by Newman & Redford. With that said, be aware that dispite the discription of the film here at Amazon, the movie is NOT Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound.  It is Dolby Digital Mono sound. If you have a decent home theater, you will be disappointed in the sound quality....the movie however is GREAT!
0802130208|5.0|Ok, my title may seem to have a touch of hyperbole but I stand by it...My buddy picked this up as a birthday present from a school library where he worked as a janitor.  I feel kinda bad about that but it's one of my favorite possessions. I read this about once a year.    Ignatius J. Reilly exists in a lot of people but no one has ever painted in black and white print such an intrusive, brilliant, (...) belly-pain-laugh inducing, exact portrait of such a person in any book, movie, anything I've ever seen.    He's Homer Simpson disguised as an enlightened sophisticate, with a Master's Degree, apparently in disapproval.    Some seem to be turned off by such a hypochondriac slob profit-eating hot dog vendor and that's understandable but how anyone can not roll over with laughter at just the prose and style itself:  Ignatius telling his poor, poor mother for the like 27th time of his horrifying (but completely uneventful and quite successful for the Greyhound company) bus ride from New Orleans to Baton Rouge:  \\"Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.\\" and \\"I vomited several times.  The driver had to stop the bus somewhere in the swamps to let me get off and walk around for a while. (His poor, poor mother)  The other passengers were rather angry. They must have stomachs of iron to ride in that awful machine.\\"  The man is remarkable in his obliviousness to his negative impact on his surroundings yet unwaveringly certain of his profound insight into all societal ills.  Kinda like Bill O'Reilly!    And the descriptions of Jones, an oft-harassed black guy in the 1960's south, who drills down his observations of the goofballs around him with keen and rational wit coming out of a cloud of cigarette smoke just slay me.   I swear to God, if you are a fan of stylistic but original writing and that effortless arrangement only a few people can do with the English language - Tom Wolfe, Joseph Heller, and even Dave Eggers (and Eggers is gonna blow my review for some people - as if anybody is out there is poking around at 1981 fiction novel critiques...) check this book out. In some circles it is considered one of the greatest American novels ever.      It's a rip-roaring hoot.  Free at your public library (unfortunately not at City High in Iowa City though).  The first 10 pages will tell you if you want to keep going or not.
0099450259|5.0|I hadn't heard about this book when I innocently picked it up and started thumbing through it at the bookstore. After reading a few pages, I knew I had to buy it and I finished it in half a day because I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />The narrator of the story is a 15-year-old (presumably autistic and obviously precocious) boy who lives in working-class England and embarks upon the task of solving the mysterious murder of a neighborhood dog. The most outstanding part of the novel is the narrator himself. Haddon brilliantly endows his narrator with unconventional powers of observation and yet the character of the narrator comes across as a real person rather than as a literary device created by the author.<br /><br />The book is a satisfying read and I would highly recommend it to everyone. In fact, I would have given it to my 9-year-old daughter but for the fact that the language is somewhat too coarse in parts (the adults are almost universally foul-mouthed, but the narrator never is). For adults, however, I cannot but give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt
B00028HBKM|5.0|I must say, this movie is one of the best I have ever seen. <br />Factual, great acting and great directing. <br />Mill have outdone himself this time. <br />Great work
B000068CNX|1.0|It didn't even come in the sleeve/case.   It didn't tell me anywhere that it wouldn't come in the case.  I would like to have the case.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Seriously, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in awhile.  I was really hyped up and saw it the first weekend of it's release in Theaters. <br /> <br />The reasons: <br />1)  For me, I can only feel and get attatched to 1 char in the movie; which was the leper(Edward Norton). <br />2)  If this movie wasn't cut to pieces, then it was one of the worst put together movies I have ever seen.  The movie just jumps from one scene to the next, with no rhyme or reason.  It is missing alot of filler that is needed to flesh out the script. <br />3)  I actually felt jipped when leaving the movie, don't think I have ever felt that way(there are bad movies, but this set a new standard). <br /> <br />I'm really, really hoping that there is a Director's Cut.  A little redemption would go a long way in making me feel better about this film. <br /> <br />AVOID this version, wait for Director's Cut if the rumors are true!!!!!
B000AMPZGC|4.0|The Corpse Bride is a visually stunning piece of stop motion, but as with many of Tim Burton's film, it is the talent of Danny Elfman that really gives it the kick it needs.  And what a kick it is. <br /> <br />The Corpse Bride doesn't have nearly as many vocal tracks as Nightmare Before Christmas (only 4) which was sort of disappointing.  Perhaps it was unnecessary, as some of our key characters express themselves pretty clearly in their shy ways and don't need a song.  Still, I'm a sucker for singing along, so I'm quite thankful for the grand, stylish, jazzy tune of \\"Remains of the Day,\\" my favorite song on the album, sang by Mr. Elfman himself, amongst others.  Other vocals include \\"According to Plan,\\" which sets up our story, \\"Tears to Shed\\" with a lovely chorus by Helena Bonham Carter, and \\"The Wedding Song\\" in which we reach the climax of our story.  Fine tracks, to be sure. <br /> <br />As I said, our main characters are pretty introverted and thus more emphasis was placed on the instrumentals.  \\"The Piano Duet\\" has to be my favorite piece, and I agree with those that say they wish it was longer.  \\"Victor's Piano Solo\\" is also excellent.  The background music is perfect for the film, each song lending to the fantastic, ethereal character thereof.  The \\"Main Titles\\" are akin to Edward Scissorhands.  Most of the songs are quiet and dreamy, with the exception of \\"The Party Arrives\\" and the 42-second \\"New Arrival,\\"  and will remind you of every detail of the snowy, gray world of The Corpse Bride. <br /> <br />As a bonus, there are 4 tracks not in the movie, played in the style of the character Bonejangles' band.  These are lots of fun and a nice added treat. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a well-constructed album and recommended to any fan of the film, Danny Elfman, or those with a taste for soft orchestral music.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|I've loved Neil Young ever since I graduated from college. The man has an honesty about him that is extremely rare. His voice, though broken and scrappy, lets the listener feel the layers of the song.  <br />Prairie Wind is about a lot of things, but personally I think it is about respect. Not the gaining of respect, but more along the lines of appreciating what has happened to a man throughout his lifetime. By now I'm sure everyone knows what he's gone through, and in an interview, Neil wished no one knew about his brain surgery. By knowing, the listener is already biased to the music before going in. Neil is a very 'open' singer, thus it takes a very 'open' listener to appreciate his music...patient as well.  <br /> <br />All this being said, Prairie Wind is a very nice album, as smooth as a James Taylor album but beyond the smoothness lies many questions about existence, God, love, and holding on.  <br /> <br />I'm a writer, and this music does an incredible job of setting the mood and allows me the chance to clarify a lot of things in my head. Perhaps that is why Neil makes these 'windy' albums. After the large Greendale project, something simple should have beeen expected. He is a loud and soft kind of guy. Though many people compare this album to Harvest and Harvest Moon (the latter in 'This Old Guitar' sounds a lot like the title track...a lot!) I look at it more from 'Comes A Time', probably one of the best sing-a-long albums out there. Harvest went in different directions, and Harvest Moon seemed determine to stay as close to mellow as possible. Prairie Wind is, without a doubt, the most humble album he has ever made. Like some critics have said, it lacks the creative thrust that many Neil Young albums are known for (Rust Never Sleeps, On The Beach), but it still remains one of the most honest CD's out there. Listen to it at nighttime with something nice to drink as you watch the sunset. If you don't like it after that, then you never will.  <br /> <br />Favorite Song: 'Falling Off the Face of the Earth'...right up there with his best.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|The only song that was pathetic was Will Nelson and Charles attempting to do \\" It was a very good year\\" Really bad.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|This dvd takes you into the early days of iron maiden. It kicks ass! The songs, promo videos, everything on this dvd is awesome, the interview got kinda boring and was hard to keep track with all the members that have been in iron maiden. but its a great dvd. GET IT NOW!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Damian's music since the album 'Mr. Marley.'  He has come along way, and I am very pleased.  Although I liked the album 'Halfway Tree', this one is just as good. <br /> <br />My Most Favorite Tracks: <br /> <br />There For You <br />Welcome To Jamrock <br />The Master Has Come Back <br />Beautiful <br />Move <br />Road To Zion <br />We're Gonna Make It <br />Khaki Suit <br /> <br />The entire album is good, with some songs being better than others of course. <br /> <br />
B00002E23E|5.0|This dvd is just purely amazing. I finnaly got my hands on this dvd last month, its different from the Led Zeppelin dvd box set. But its worth it. The songs kick ass and we get to see zeppelins artistic view in cutscenes. Very weird, trippy kinda movie. Its great!!!
0451204530|3.0|Die-hard Ken Follett fans may be a bit disppointed with this book, since the plot is not as well tied as some of his other works. But it makes for a good, quick read. It is fast paced with little break in the action. If you read the book for what it is (fiction) and try not to tie it to historical events, I think it's a very enjoyable book!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|This obviously aint a concert dvd. This dvd takes you through all the ups and downs metallica has been through. From their debut album kill em all up to there upcoming album st. anger. the band is going through tough times in this dvd. Im a big huge fan of metallica, i have all their albums and probably all their music dvds. So if you aint into documentarys and just wanna see them play, this dvd is not for you.
0385504209|5.0|Following up in similar fashion to Angels & Demons, this book is an absolute page turner! Dan Brown does an excellent job of delivering a thrilling plot and heart pounding suspense woven beautifully with a historical/religious backdrop. Robert Langdon, the protagonist, is called upon on the mysterious death of a museum curator who leaves behind enigmatic clues to apparently convey something of significance to his daughter. To unravel this mystery, Langdon is thrown into a whirlwind of suspense and drama that leads him into a journey through Europe, and mysteries dating back several ages to days of the Priory of Sion, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Gallileo, to name a few.<br /><br />There has been enough controversy on the religious and historical significance of this book, so I won't belabor on that issue. I think Brown raises some meaningful questions about the Church in its infancy before a meteoric rise to power, but there are instances in the book where he seems to be stretching it a bit too far. I think Dan Brown is not trying to claim that his interpretation of historical events and art is the absolute truth. His contention is that an alternative theory to what we have always believed to be true for ages, is at least plausible. That, I think, is really the essence of the historical aspect of this book.<br /><br />Given that this book is fiction, I think readers should try to enjoy the book for what it is...a fast-paced pensive thriller, perhaps one of the best in ages!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I like this cd, it has a variety of cool songs. I'd say its less Pop than her other cds. That R.Kelly produced joint is off the chain chain!!..... All of the people that only gave her on star probably didnt buy her album and are just here to complain about her music when really no one is forcing them to listen to it.  Ignorant people I swear. Go read a book or something. Anyways, Im not even a big fan of hers but I can say that In the Zone was actually pretty decent. Thank You.
B00082IJ08|5.0|This Album is one of my favorites to come out this year.  It is VERY GOOD, but not perfect.  I give it 4.5 stars, but not 5.  Some things to realize before listening to this: This is a VERY different album from the original gorillaz album.  The producer on this album is Dangermouse instead of Automater(on the original Gorillaz album).  Although Dangermouse's beats aren't as catchy and charming, they are still very pleasing.  Some of the tracks have almost a dark and grimey undertone but are actually very sick on second and third listen.  The only real qualms I have with the album is that I can't listen to it from start to finish all the way through.  My favorite tracks are:  O Green World, Dirty Harry, Feel Good Inc., El Manana, Every Planet We Reach Is Dead, November Has Come, All Alone, and Dare.  Some of the tracks are entertaining to listen to such as Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head, but aren't that great.  Demon Days and Don't Get Lost In Heaven are very spacey and not very good tracks in my opinion.  Not horrible, but just not up to par with the rest of the album, and they sound almost the same.  Kids with Guns and Last Living Souls are good tracks, but nothing amazing.  The album misses Del tha Funkee Homosapien on it, but is still pretty sick and has lots of other collaborations (De La Soul, MF Doom, etc.) that still make for a very solid tracklist.  This album isn't as lyrically talented as the first one (which had sick flows from del on a lot of the hip hop focused tracks), but the beats sort of make up for it.  On songs like Dirty Harry and All Alone that don't really have lyrics for the most part, its fine because the beats are SICK, and i mean super sweet.  the same could be said about Dare.  All in all its a very solid album.  Don't pick this one up expecting it to sound like the first gorillaz album, and make sure that you listen to it several times before dismissing it.  I didn't like it very much on first listen, but i've realized its actuallya masterpiece, it just takes some time to see it clearly for what it is.  One thing you have to remember when you listen to this album is that Del has left the group, so there isn't really a true M.C. in this band anymore, but they still manage to put out a very solid hip-hop (sort of) album.  This is in part due to collabs, and Damon trying his voice at doing it but he doesn't really have the voice for rapping.  Don't pick this up looking for sick flows because they aren't there on a lot of the tracks (except songs such as feel good inc., november has come, and a few others).
0553382179|5.0|This is the cheapest therapy out there!  There are some reviews that this book is a waste - duh, 15 minutes a day.  There are some of us that need to be told what to do to make our lives easier and someone to tell us!  I felt like this book was written just for me.  Very helpful for those who just can't seem to make it all work.
B000006NPY|4.0|Although releasing an 80's inspired, gothic infused record at the height of the britpop phenomenon back in1996 was probably not the best career move, adore the bands forth studio album, found the pumpkins veering away from the more traditional grunge sound of their earlier releases to more textural soundscapes and in places reveals Billy corgans love of New Order and other 80's electronica inspired bands something he would also explore on 2003's zwan mary star of the sea album.  From sparse piano tinged ballads (For Martha) and Zeppelinesque (Tear) through to the lilting Once upon A time, Adore contains some of the pumpkins prettiest and most affecting songs an album that proves more rewarding with each play rather than an instant hit those seeking the bands more commercial work should start elsewhere.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The DVD to \\"Farewell 1 Tour\\" by the Eagles is OUTSTANDING!  I watched the t.v. coverage of this concert, and had to own it!  The energy of the crowd in Melbourne beckons/allows you to become a part of the whole.  If you are an Eagles fan, believe me, you will absolutely LOVE this concert!  The group has never sounded better, and their writing, timing and overall performance skills have gotten even better over the years! <br /> <br />God Bless you Eagles!  Looking forward to Farewell 2! <br /> <br />Cynthia Stead <br />Portland, OR

B00003CXP1|5.0|This is one of those films that a person can be obsessed with--assuming they can stomach it in the first place.  Since I'm the type of person who's watched \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" so many times I've memorized most of the dialogue, and emit enthusiastic laughs at the most horrific scenes, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is kind of like a warm bath.  Of course, since I'm clearly a deranged mutant, what would the \\"average\\" deranged person think?  For one thing, they might get the idea that heroin isn't all it's cracked up to be, unless of course you long for misery, anguish, pshysical/mental deterioration and the sweet, sweet oblivion of death.  Well, if heroin addiction is too much of an investment for you (I've been told it can take up a lot of your time), but dig the schadenfreude of watching people (okay, actors) experience the other stuff, then this is movie for you!<br /><br />To be fair, since after all I've went and given the film 5 stars, and I honestly do love it, \\"Requiem\\" is also highly reccommended to anyone sick of the processed, pre-chewed gruel of most mainstream studio fare and want to support challenging, bleeding-edge filmmakers, this is definitely for you.  Director/boy genius Darren Aronofsky has clearly seen the advances of Godard, Tarantino, Tom (\\"Run Lola Run\\") Tykwer and yes, even the best of music videos and decided to do them one better.  If this impulse had been applied to a regular genre picture, like \\"romantic comedy\\" or \\"thriller\\" or \\"Ashton Kutcher,\\" it could have been an embarrassment.  Hubert Selby's original novel was nihlistic, but it was justly hailed for its gritty, hard-boiled style, which most directors seeking to adapt it would have forgotten about, instead delivering just a wallow in suffering.  Aronofsky uses every trick in the editing bag and probably invents a few new ones to make his harrowing tale compelling, even on many repeated viewings.  Sure, dismiss it as an American \\"Trainspotting\\" if you must, but whereas that film eventually retreated into cheap irony, in \\"Requiem\\" it's totally organic to the story, and even, dare I say, sincere.<br /><br />Some critics have even sniped at the mother character portrayed so brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn.  An aging, lonely woman as a drug addict?  Come on, they say, be real!  Where they're totally wrong is that while her son and his friends are busy with heroin, this is clearly contrasted with her own addiction to television and \\"diet Pills\\" (amphetamines).  Addiction is a common denominator of most people--just about everyone has some fix they need to function.  Actually, I wouldn't trust someone without some kind of addiction--in Aronofsky's view, there are no benign addictions.  While I'd argue that point--things like heroin or god are far worse than say, repeatedly watching \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or, for that matter, \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" Aronofsky's point is made at least as well as the Velvet Undergound's \\"Heroin.\\"  It should also be noted that this isn't an anti-drug polemic.  If anything, Aronofsky wants to point out the futility of legislating, and punishing, what is after all human nature.<br /><br />Actually, the main reason I'm even writing this review is a way to satisfy my anticipation of Aronofsky's next project, the science fiction parable \\"The Fountain,\\" which the last time I looked was slated for release in early '06 (it had previously been scheduled for December '05).  I can't think of any better way to prepare for what I'm sure will be another mind-blower than to watch \\"Requiem.\\" Just be sure to buy the unrated version instead of the cut-for-Blockbuster R-rated edition.  As long as you're wallowing in pain, misery and the sweet, sweet oblivion of death, you might as well do it right.tually retreated into cheap irony, in \\"Requiem\\" it's totally organic to the story, and even, dare I say, sincere.   <br /> <br />Some critics have even sniped at the mother character portrayed so brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn.

0689835604|5.0|My daughter loved this book.  It really helped her learn different body parts.  She is 20 months old and still loves for me to read the book to her.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|this is insane visual stimuli.--  very tasty with multiple listening sessions. straight through it feels like a lifetime of events. listen to with the lights off and get ready.  i think you should try it out somehow...
0783229526|5.0|Having read the semi-autobiographical book before seeing this movie, I really had no idea what to expect. I still don't think one is better than the other, they both have different feels; the book is darker, like reading a seedy, nightmarish lsd trip. The movie is    different, slightly lighter (only slightly) and is an absolute assault on the senses. <br /> <br />I have heard that the original director was fired, before the subsequent director, Terry Gilliam was hired. What a piece of luck for this adaptation. Gilliams brilliant vision makes this an amazing film to watch. Every time I see this, there are scenes that blow my mind in terms of camera work. Gilliam combines the most stunning scenery with crazy angles and cuts to make this a surreal adventure through and through. <br /> <br />Aside from this is the pure attention to detail that gets me every time; there is more in this movie than you could pay attention to with three or four people watching the movie for days. Every time I watch it I see some new character, hear new background dialogue, or notice an effect that had previously gone unnoticed.My favourite is the archangel holding a burning sword outside the restaurant in L.A when Duke first recieves his orders to go to vegas. <br /> <br />In terms of the story, the movie is everything i hoped for. Las vegas is portrayed perfectly as the seedy, tacky, heart of the american dream that is the entire point behind this satirical monologue. The characters within vegas are desperate hopeless people in search of happiness they will never find in a freak circus town such as Gilliam displays. The main characters were picked for perfection.Johnny Depp, being a personal friend of Thompson's, plays a role he must know well. However, the real star of the film is Benicio Del Toro: this man can play a character to a T. Dr. Gonzo transforms from a semi-professional \\"attorney\\" to a drug-crazed fiend within the space of the lobby of a hotel and the soundproof room the pairoccupy. There are scenes featuring Del Toro that make me laugh out loud, and there are scenes that disgust me in how sincerely Del Toro looks like he's just eaten a whole sheet of acid and wants himself to be electrocuted. The multitude of star cameos in the film do their job well; everyone from Penn of Penn & Teller to Thompson himself are in the film, and the high quality cameos keep on coming -  a personal favourite of mine is Flea from the chilli peppers licking lsd off Duke's arm in a public toilet - it really is hilarious. <br /> <br />There is not a minute of this movie i didn't enjoy. It is admittedly a very in your face film, but thats what was intended. This is the clash of two great american dreams, the hippies vs. the norm, so what do you expect? The extended title says it all; a savage journey to the heart of the american dream. It is savage, but it is also hilarious, mind bending, depraved, and amazing, all in the same movie. What more could you want from a great adaptation?
0140177396|3.0|The novel'Of Mice and Men' by John steinbeck deals with the Great Depression. He uses the two protagonists George and Lennie to convey the poor fate of many Americans of those days. George and Lennie experience this beeing hands on a farm, which is mainly leaded by the cruel son of the boss, Curley. <br /> <br />Hope of their dream to own a farm is the only thing that gives their rough life sense. But the hope dies at the point when George kills Lennie, consequently it seems that having a dream is unnecessary if the sourrounding circumstances are not accordingly. I do not agree with the message Steinbeck pointed out.  <br /> <br />In each beginning of a chapter the place of action is described in detail followed by a dialogue. This structure reminds me of a play, at first the stage direstions and then the play. I think it becomes boring after a time, especially because there happens too less action at different locations. Using dialogues is a clever way to encourage the reader's imagination. <br /> <br />Besides I dislike steinbecks's view of women, which he imlpies by the only feminine character, Curley's wife. He portays a picture of a trouble making, cruel and nameless object. But probably I'm of this opinion because I'm a girl. <br /> <br />Over all it is to say that the novel cannot be put in one category. Steinbeck has his own style to impress his intention. His message is not obvious but if you read between the lines and think about it, you will find it out and then you can decide whether you agree. So this is the message i found out: Is hope right even if the situation seems to be hopeless and is our fate already predicted? Questions that need to be thought over. Finally 'Of Mice and Men'is a book it is necessary to think about.  <br /> <br />
1573223026|1.0|I'm a huge Nick Hornby fan.  I've always been intrigued by Hornby's uncanny ability to write from someone else's perspective.  He did it well in High Fidelity and in About a Boy, but when How to be Good came out, I was amazed with his ability to capture the female voice.  With A Long Way Down, he writes in 4 separate voices - 2 male and 2 female.  The characters are as different as night and day - or in this case, night and day and dawn and dusk - and they meet when each of them decides to end it all on New Year's Eve atop a building infamous for suicides.      <br /> <br />Hornby has flirted with the darker side of life in his previous books, so when I heard about the premise in A Long Way Down, I wasn't worried.  He handles the topic with a simplicity that allows the humor to come through without letting us forget what these people had intended to do in the first place.   <br /> <br />In the end the book is hopeful and funny with a smattering of resolve and resignation to our lots in life.  Check it out.
B0006399FS|5.0|The band U2 has reached a point in their careers that when they release a new album, it is going to be greeted with great anticipation.    Earlier in their career albums such as \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Acthung Baby\\"  brought them not only commercial success, but critical acclaim.    In the 90s, they expanded on the experimental mode that had started with \\"Acthung Baby\\" got mixed results with \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\".   When U2 released, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", many felt that U2 went back to the basics.   Once again, the critics were embracing U2 and they were selling big albums.   In a way, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\"  elevated U2 to an elite status in Rock music history.      In fact, I don't think one is going out on a limb when you put U2 on the same tier as the Beatles.   Thus, when U2 was getting ready to release \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\", the level of anticipation for this album was perhaps as high as any Beatles album.     The band would also heavily promote that album - and that would spurn great sales.   While this album didn't have as many critics as \\"Pop\\", there were some critics.    However, I completely disagree with those critics.  U2 backs up the high level of anticipation that they created for \\"Atomic Bomb\\".   This late 2004 release would the album that would produce some of 2005's best music - therefore is my pick for 2005's Best Album. <br /> <br />Like \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", U2 goes back to basics.   For the most part they employ a classic rock formula (with the possible exception of \\"Vertigo\\" and to a lesser extent \\"A Man and a Woman\\").    Much of the music is going to be centered around The Edge's guitar and Adam Clayton's Bass.   While Larry Mullen takes a prominent role on this album on drums and percussion, like most U2 albums Mullen isn't going to provide ferocious drumming (i.e. he's no Neil Peart).  This isn't a knock on U2 or Mullen - it's just that this is the way U2 has always made use of Mullen's drumming.   In fact, in some cases - it almost feels that U2 went back to the 1960s and used brought a 1960s Classic Rock sound into 21st Century Music.   Of course, Bono's vocals are as strong as ever - even 25+ years into his career. <br /> <br />Here is a track by track look at this collection: <br />\\"Vertigo\\": This song was probably the song that had the least Classic Rock feel and most mainstream music feel.   The unique thing about this song is that it was a hit among Modern Rock, Classic Rock, and even Adult Contemporary fans.   The Edge's guitar and Clayton's bass are in rare form here - and combined with Bono's vocals the band is clearly having fun.  I think Edge's background vocals and the bits of Spanish really help with this broad appeal. <br /> <br />\\"Miracle Drug\\": We get some rare background vocals from Larry Mullen on this track and The Edge even gets a chance to sing lead for a small part of the song.  This song, while not the strongest on the album has more of U2's trademark sound.  Edge's guitar takes on more of a classic feel. <br /> <br />\\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\":  Another song that has a Classic anthemic U2 feel.    The Edge provides some terrific guitar work with some great keyboards.  This song does a great job at \\"switching gears\\" at the right time and it the final product really comes together. <br /> <br />\\"Love and Peace or Else\\":  This song has a modern rock sound, but I can also hear a slight Blues influence to the beat and it will give this modern sound a Classic Rock influence.   Edge provides some nice piano to compliment some riveting guitar work.   Mullen also stands out with some great drum work. <br /> <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\":  This is a masterpiece.  Everything comes together for this song.     It has the Classic anthemic U2 feel to it  - especially in the guitar chords.  There is some great the piano work by Edge and Bono.   Bono really takes it up a notch when he sings \\"Oh you look so beautiful tonight\\".   This is the band's tribute to the big cities and how the band still loves to go there.   <br /> <br />\\"All Because of You\\":  This song might have a title more like a pop song than a classic U2 anthem, but don't underestimate this.   U2 is in high gear throughout this whole song.   Edge's guitar perhaps never sounds better - and I think the same can be said for Clayton's Bass and Mullen's Drums.  I think the real star here are the vocals - Bono's lead with some outstanding background vocals by Edge.  The guitar work has a Classic Feel (even reminds me a bit like The Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\"). <br /> <br />\\"A Man and a Woman\\": Another great track.  While it has a 2000's music feel to it, the classic natural guitar sound is really what gives this song its charm. <br /> <br />\\"Crumbs From Your Table\\":  Mullen provides some great highlights with his drumming on this song.   Bono's vocals this time gave this song a bit of Classic Rock feel. <br /> <br />\\"One Step Closer\\": Underrated track on this album.   This song has U2's classic slower sound here and almost has a trance feel.  Bono's vocals are aren't a cappella, but they are close. <br /> <br />\\"Original of the Species\\": Another underrated track.  The chorus has a classic 1960s Rock feel.  It has some synthesizers and it creates some great sounds.    <br /> <br />\\"Yahweh\\":   This is U2's tribute to God.   This song could easily have been a Christian Contemporary hit.  I found it a very uplifting song.  Edge once again shines with guitar and background vocals. <br /> <br />The liner notes contain all of the lyrics, songwriting, and musician credits.   There are also some black and white photos of the band.  The bottom line is that this album lives up to all the hype.  A must have.
B000002VE7|5.0|Strangely enough, my online dictionary defines Stereotomy as: \\"The science or art of cutting solids into certain figures or sections, as arches, and the like; especially, the art of stonecutting.\\"  Is this how the album describes the splitting of Parsons/Woolfson?  It certainly is the most personal album of the entire Project, and one of my favorites. <br />As for the cover - if you turn the picture upside down, you can see it's not part of any ink-blot test - it's the negative of a gorilla's head and shoulders.  The inner beast of the artist, perhaps?

B000002HMH|1.0|The only reason I am giving this one 1 star is because that is the lowest it goes. Now don't lission to what anyone else has said on here about this cd. It sucks!!!!! THis is one the worst cds I have ever herd by metallica well this and reload and there verson of Misfits. If like real metal then don't get this one. Get old metallica like anything before the black cd. Well S&M was ok the newest cd St. whatever is better then this crap. What where you thinking Metallica and the rest of you people for saying buy this what are you smoking crack or like 10 or somthing. Get over it Metallica is dead musicly. You know who has never changed Slayer and they came out the same time as Metallica and has alwas keep it hard. If you are looking for a old band that still rock pick up anything by slayer. Because Slayer fans would kill metallica fans even one of the members of metallica said this. So leave metallica alone and go with Slayer. Hail SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000B19BCG|3.0|Supergrass is one of those bands that has so much talent they can do anything they want.  Every album up to this point has had strong ambitions and dynamic energy.<br /><br />Before I heard Road To Rouen I had high expectations (of course!); some reviews I read that this would be an exceptional albeit relaxed album; comparing it to Supergrass (album) in the sense that the mood was mellow and world weary.<br /><br />There are no songs that really pop out as superior.  There are some really good songs like St. Petersburg, Kick In The Teeth, and Sad Girl; in fact most of the songs are great.  But none of them really have that special something that identifies them as an instant classic song like Grace, Moving, Tonight, or Mansize Rooster; although St. Petersburg comes really close.<br /><br />The two longer songs Tales Of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6) and Roxy are pretty interesting- they are the two longest songs Supergrass has released to date.  The feeling is very different than what they have done before in that they are orchested; Tales of Endurance sounds like it could have fit very neatly in with Led Zeppelin's In Through The Outdoor with it's crunchy guitar riffs and atmospheric keyboard sections.<br /><br />Overall, Supergrass is still way better than most bands- and if this was any other band I might given it five stars.<br /><br />If you are new to their music you should probably check out In It For The Money or one of the the other three first.  If you're already a fan than you know it can't be all that bad- it's just not their best.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I say this is the best CD of the world because all the songs<br /><br />rock and this is a huge masterpiece. It features the songs such<br /><br />as WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, SWEET CHILD OF MINE, PARADISE CITY,<br /><br />and NOVEMBER RAIN. If you want the best, pick this, GNR Greatest<br /><br />Hits. Led Zeppelin sucks!!!!!

B000000WCA|4.0|While I still think that their SpiceWorld was their best album, I thought that the Spice Girls put out a fun debut in 1996. It didn't hit America until February 1997, but I loved this album and its fun grooves.  Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, who produced half the album, and Absolute, who produced the other half, gave the Girls some solid pop songs. But Wannabe sounds corny today compared to the richness of album cuts like the breezy Say You'll Be There, the nice ballad 2 Become 1, the catchy numbers of If You Can't Dance, Last Time Lover and Something Kinda Funny and others. There was a B-side song to Wannabe that should have been on the album, because it had some heavy funk on it.  Maybe it was just too good. The best singer of the group is Victoria Beckham and she has always been the best out of the average voices of the other four.  She had always stood out on each of the group's three albums vocally. The group had huge success with this debut and some successful world tours. Getting them back together won't happen; they've got other things in their lives to do.  But they really made a fun debut of escapist, catchy pop songs that still doesn't get out of your head. Thanks for the memories, girls!
B000BKJ78K|1.0|Well, my friends, you may have heard the news. <br />  George Lucas and 2oth Century Fox are re-releasing the Star Wars trilogy on DVD. <br /> No, it's not the ORIGINAL CLASSIC TRILOGY THAT WE ALL LONG FOR.I sincerely wish it was, as those are the movies that made me fall in love with Star Wars to begin with (Well, not literally in love, but you get the point).  <br /> <br />  No, apparently Lucas' ego cant come to grips with releasing the movies that made his hiney famous to begin with (The ORIGINAL Movies, untouched by Lucas' sometimes irritating \\"tweaking\\".) <br /> No, this set is the same exact set that was released last year  (The \\"Special Editions\\"), only, they have new packaging, and the 4th bonus disc that was included with last year's DVD set is NOT included with this set! <br />  That's correct, Lucas and Fox want you to spend over $30 for a set that is WITHOUT the 4th Bonus disc that the last set had. <br />I.E., Lucas wants you to fork over $30+ dollars for a NEW BOX. <br /> That's it. New packaging. The packing looks much like the packing for the last set, only the metallic Silver/black, and Gold/black have been changed to the colors of the original Star Wars movie poster. <br /> You can see the new packaging, by going to [...] <br />  Is it worth over $30? <br /> That's up to YOU. <br /> <br />  But one question remains....WHY? <br /> Why re-release the SAME EXACT MOVIES, when the shelves of stores all across the world are still stocked with the original packaging? <br /> Why take the 4th bonus disc OUT of this set? <br /> Why charge people over $30 just for a new box, but with the same darn movies? <br /> Why not just release the ORIGINALS instead of releasing the same darn \\"special edition\\" Trilogy twice in Two years? <br />   It is easier to understand Jar Jar Binks, than it is to answer the questions asked above. <br /> But if you use the force, the answer will come to you. <br /> Yes, come to you it will. <br /> That answer????? <br />M O N E Y <br />Yes, the answer is money. <br /> Lucas and Fox have chosen to steal 30 MORE dollars from their fans, by redecorating the box that the same movies as last years release came in, in hopes that you'll fork over more money. <br /> Yes, Grinches, Lucas and Fox are, yes, yes! <br /> They could have given Star Wars fans the ULTIMATE Christmas DVD gift- The original movies, restored, remastered, for us to finally own and enjoy and for us to relive many fond memories with. <br /> But, those classic movies are not being released on DVD anytime in the near future. In fact, Lucas says that he will not EVER release them. <br /> When the rumored \\"Ultimate\\" Star Wars Saga 6 DVD set is released, we may be able to see some deleted scenes from the original trilogy....the ones that Lucas removed 20 years later. <br /> We MAY have that to look forward to. But then again, this comes from a man who says that he cares about the people who made him a billionaire, yet robs them of the movies that they DO want, and repackages the movies that they already have, so that they will buy the darn things a year later. <br />Thus the reason why the 4th disc has been removed....it makes the set sell for only $30 dollars rather than close to $50. <br />I.E, Lucas and Fox want to hypnotize as many fans as possible, into buying this cheaper set, for the Holiday rush. Is it a coincidence that the DVD's are being released December 6th? <br /> Not September 6th. Not January 6th. No, these DVD's are being re-released right square between Thanksgiving and Christmas, when shoppers will be most busy. They waited until Star wars fans would go to the store and buy Volume 2 of the cool \\"Clone wars\\" Cartoon, and they wanted to make us impulsively buy the movies that we impulsively bought two extra copies of a year ago. <br /> They are looking for \\"spur of the moment\\" dollars. <br /> If they cared for their fans, they would have made this CHEAPER set available to us last year, but then they would have lost thatextra $20 dollars, and they couldnt allow that. <br /> No, they waited til they bled consumers dry on the last set, before they threw the DVD's in a new box and made them available in THIS set. Without the bonus disc of course. <br /> <br /> I am mad about this. Granted, there ARE more important things going on in the Universe than a damn DVD set. <br /> But this is an insult to Star Wars fans. Star Wars movies have always been about values, honor and integrity. <br /> It is a shame that the maker and distributors of these films do not hold the same values, honor and integrity. They have become money whores like any other businessmen. <br /> They are as greedy as Boba Fett negotiating on what a valued bounty should be worth to him. It's all about money. Star Wars is a business to George Lucas. That is why he hasnt had a problem re-doing many of the original movie scenes. To him, its just a job. <br /> To him, these are just movies. <br />  The force is NOT strong in George Lucas. <br /> If it was, he wouldn't throw these EXACT movies as last year's DVD release in our faces and ask for over $30. <br /> If the force was truly with Lucas, he would have done what Spielberg did with E.T.-Released the original AND Special Editions of the movies, so that his vision and his fans memories could BOTH be fulfilled. <br /> Mr Lucas, you have much to learn, my old Padawan. <br />  The dark side is greed. Consume you it has. <br />   Forgotten who made your dreams come true you have.Otherwise you would have made our dreams come true, and given us the movies that we have been dreaming of. Not the same movies in a new box. <br />  Grateful that is not. <br />   Ok, no more Yoda talk. <br /> <br /> Mr Lucas, you are wrong for re-releasing these movies on DVD. <br />  You just want people like me..... die-hard Star Wars fans to fork over 30 MORE dollars into your Billionaire account. <br /> And we will. And I probably will too. I'll see the new packaging, and say \\"No, this guy onlywants money....you HAVE these movies already, Matt... walk away......but..... there IS new packaging......and the price is LOWER without the bonus disc...., well why not\\", and our urge to relive those Star wars memories will take us over and overshadow the reality that we are buying the movies because they appear different. You know that, and you let it occur anyway. You use our very love of the movies that made you who you are, and you use it to bleed even more and more money out of us. <br /> Palpatine would have been proud.
B00003CX8U|4.0|The film is a revelation for those who like me had only seen Roy Scheider in 'Jaws' and 'The French Connection' . You will see a whole other side to his talents in ALL THAT JAZZ , though this is not a film that is easy to watch. It gives a warning to both the character and the viewer - the director was giving a warning to himself too . <br />It also shows what showbiz people are willing to sacrifice in the name of their lifestyle . <br /> <br />I suppose it could be called pretentious but then so could a lot of entertainers themselves . The film shows the less likeable aspects of showbiz , which makes it unsettling . <br /> <br />You will not soon forget some of the scenes . <br />You may not watch it regularly due to its confronting nature , <br />but it does show some positive insights and there is some great dancing .   <br />Recommended for the adventurous viewer .
0930289528|2.0|Let me first say that it's a well-written, fascinating, literate piece of work. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />Then again, afterwards you're left with a sort of empty feeling. Because where did those horrors Moore alludes to come from? And the answer is: from the beliefs that Moore espouses!<br /><br />Yes, ladies and gentlemen. In the scene where he broadcasts a message via a TV station, he plainly states that we are just animals, fresh off the tree. And this was the exact view that Hitler, for one, used to justify his campaign of killing the unwanted: the old, the infirm, the mentally ill, gays, Jews. As Bethell writes:<br /><br />\\"During the period of American neutrality in World War I, Kellogg was posted to the headquarters of the German general staff and was shocked to find German military leaders, sometimes with the Kaiser present, supporting the war with an \\"evolutionary rationale.\\" They did so with \\"a particularly crude form of natural selection, defined as inexorable, bloody battle. ...<br /><br />  \\"The creed of the Allmacht [\\"all might\\" or omnipotence] of a natural selection based on violent and competitive struggle is the gospel of the German intellectuals; all else is illusion and anathema.O This struggle not only must go on, for that is the natural law, but it should go on so that this natural law may work out in its cruel, inevitable way the salvation of the human species.O That human group which is in the most advanced evolutionary stage should win in the struggle for existence.<br /><br />\\"You like Darwin?\\" The German intellectuals were saying. \\"We'll give you Darwin.\\" (end quote)<br /><br />So Moore does not offer a solution but a deeper problem. But perhaps this was his intent? I don't know his beliefs.<br /><br />He portrays a cardinal or bishop or something as a pedophile, in one of many tired stereotypes; but it was Che Guevara, Mao, Stalin and friends, dire *enemies* of the church, who were responsible for butchering and torturing millions (well, Che didn't kill millions, just a few political enemies and gays, I guess. Another hero of the youth today!?). So there is a sort of blindness in his thinking that detracts from the book, makes you wonder about the seemingly clever bits of witty wisdom scattered throughout.<br /><br />But more troubling, his anti-hero butchers all manner of policemen, not sadistic thugs but poor sods just doing their job. But at least that's true to Darwinistic form. Maybe Moore is really trying to argue against Darwinistic amorality? You certainly feel for those poor working-class stiffs he kills off \\"for the greater good.\\"<br /><br />Again, his craftsmanship of the dialogue and frames are unquestioned. It's the lack of a coherent message that's the problem. The film ads say, \\"Governments should be afraid of their people.\\" All well and good, but what is he saying? That all citizens should have the right to bear arms? Or not? Perhaps just the supermen? He doesn't go far enough, is the problem; just far enough to give you a good sound bite.<br /><br />So - enjoy, but question. Even graphic novels should be taken skeptically, right? All in all, I enjoyed \\"Watchmen\\" more.ing and torturing millions (well, Che didn't kill millions, just a few political enemies and gays, I guess. Another hero of the youth today!?).

1878424319|4.0|This book helped me to recognize the source of quite a few of my problems.  The four agreements:  Be impeccable with your word, Don't make assumptions, Don't take anything personally, and Always do your best are valuable lessons for us all.  The weakness of the book, however, is that it is very repetitive.  The examples are good, but the author keeps repeating some of the same phrases over and over (perhaps until we \\"get it\\"?)  I think it could have been shortened to about 50-60 pages (it's 138 as published). <br /> <br />I do recommend you read it; it contains valuable insights.  Just be prepared to skip over some parts.
055299703X|5.0|Bryson combines a compelling case for a trip to Australia with a terrific sense of humor.  Who else could make the driest, most remote, and deadliest country in the world a must for any traveler.  I couldn't put this down.
015603008X|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful, well written books I've ever read. Emotion is poured into every word, so much that I cried at the end, which I usually don't do.  If you haven't already, you NEED to read this book. It shows the transformation of a retarded man into a genius, and all of the emotional effects that betide him.  I love Algernon!
B000000OYN|4.0|Whitesnake were the weakest of the post-Purple spin-off bands, mostly due to the pedestrian nature of the material and the lackluster playing of those involved. However, if one can get past the cliched lyrics and predictable arrangements, they'll find one of the band's stronger and more consistent releases here. Following a pair of mediocre albums (1980's Ready 'N' Willing and 1981's Come An' Get It)and a short break, the band reconvened and returned with their strongest set since the very good Lovehunter in 1979. While the lyrics are beyond embarrassing, the material is performed with an energy and fire lacking on the previous two albums. Despite Coverdale's valiant effort to destroy the songs with his juvenile lyrics, the band perform them with such vigor that they almost always manage to make them work.Included here are the original and far superior versions of Here I Go Again and Crying In The Rain. These were both re-recorded for their huge 1987 album, with that version of Here I Go Again topping the charts all around the globe. Both the originals are more stripped down than the remakes and are just warmer overall. This is a far from perfect album, but if you're looking for a good example of early Whitesnake, this is a great place to start.
B000AL730Y|5.0|People who write reviews about music they don't know about, are complete idiots.  Take SLICE for example (see below).  He doesn't know great music when he hears it.  McCartney is talent my friend and \\"Chaos and Creation\\" is the ultimate experience!!
B0006L16N8|2.0|I still haven't received this item. I've e-mailed the vendor to check with status and I never received a replied. I'm very upset...
B000AL730O|5.0|These one and two star reviews are almost comical. No melodies? No memorable songs? Right.... You get the feeling that these one-star reviewers listened to Chaos and Creation one time, tossed the CD aside and said, \\"It stinks.\\" Well, it takes more effort than that.<br /><br />While the majority of songs stick to the old memory banks after the first listen, it is after repeated listenings that the whole set gels. By the third or fourth time I heard Chaos, I couldn't get the darn album out of my head.<br /><br />The new single Fine Line, along with Friends to Go, English Tea and Promise to You Girl are some of the catchiest tunes Paul has penned. Ever. Songs such as Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain and Anyway are not only catchy, but are amongst Paul's most mature tunes.<br /><br />The arrangements, dotted with strings, horns and piano, are varied throughout. Paul really displays his musical chops by handling most of the instrument work himself including cello, flugelhorn and harmonium.<br /><br />Overall, Chaos and Creation is McCartney's strongest CD in years. It is a mature piece of work which should not only age well, but also find its place amongst Sir Paul's finest solo albums.
0452282152|3.0|This was an easy read but pretty slow in the beginning.  I didn't get into it until midway through the book, but I enjoyed the way the story is told through the eyes of Griet.  I disliked the ending, and thought the story should have ended earlier. <br /> <br />I have also seen the movie, which misses a lot of the story that Chevalier creates, but the ending of the movie is the way I would have preferred the book ending.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|Came within the specified time. The product was in excellent condition!
B00006JL1Z|2.0|Yet another attempt to re-write history and ignore the pre-Rumours era of the band. To truly be called The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac, you would have to include at least, Black Magic Woman, Oh Well, Sentimental Lady and Hypnotized. There are many more quintessential songs from the pre-Buckingham/Nicks era that should be included, but those four were in heavy FM rotation in the early 70's. They exposed the band to a huge audience, which made their commercial breakthrough in 1975 possible. To exclude them and then title this release a \\"best of\\" is criminal.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This CD is great to put in the stereo and then climb into a nice relaxing bath.  It is mellow and fun!
B00006AW2M|5.0|'Between the Buttons' is to 'Revolver' as 'The Satanic Majesties Request' is to 'Sgt. Pepper's'.  However comparing this with 'Sgt Peppers' is foolish.  This is only an analogy, the music is totally different.  This is the psychedelic Rolling Stones not the Beatles and the Stones' are one of the best rock music composers as this is one of the best psychedelic releases in rock history.    Like any other Stone's album released between 1964-1972, it contains songs written at the Stone's creative peak.  \\"2000 Man\\" is an astonishing song: a real classic.  Other songs like \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" or \\"Citadel\\" are also incredible.  But listing songs is not really fair because all of them are amazing.  The album reflects a concept that can only be abstracted when listening all songs from start to finish and every song has its meaning and purpose.  This is an outstanding album that is often overlooked.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Before I begin this review, I'd like to take this opportunity to offer the disclaimer that I am a hopeless George fan, and very biased in this review. I adore his cool style, his unique yet beautiful voice, his singing slide guitar, his poetic words and stirring music...and I miss him deeply. And few albums make me miss him more than this one.  <br /> <br />\\"George Harrison\\" might best be described as a sort of \\"mystical folk\\" album. A magical, almost sparkling sound seems to emit from the instruments, and the result is spectacular. The songs have been finely crafted, and George's voice is in splendid shape all around. Words, melody and music come together in just the right way to make an excellent disc that (I think) everyone ought to have in their collection.  <br /> <br />The mood is mostly mellow for this album, but that doesn't mean that the songs are dull! Not in the least. From the soaring melodies of \\"Faster,\\" \\"Blow Away\\" and \\"Your Love is Forever\\" to the slinky groove of \\"Not Guilty\\" and \\"Soft-Hearted Hana,\\" -- the elegant styling of \\"Here Comes the Moon,\\" \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" and \\"Soft Touch\\" to the feel-good sound of \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" and \\"If You Believe\\" -- nothing on this disc will fail to enchant. It's the creme of Harrison's crop.  <br /> <br />Although I recommend everything George has done, I recommend this one especially highly. It'll make you feel like you could fly through the clouds...and it might make you cry. It's that beautiful.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|Ditto to the requests for full season sets. Far lesser (and undeserving) contemporary shows get the full season treatment, while Hollywood feels the need to test market many of these classic programs. <br /> <br /> C'mon! <br /> <br />Most baby boomers watched these programs in either in prime time or syndication, so there is a market for  Golden Age westerns like \\"Maverick.\\" <br /> <br />Anyway, enjoyed the dvd.  The writing in this show (prior to James Garner's exit) was consistently exceptional. I especially enjoyed 'Gun Shy', a very effective parody of \\"Gunsmoke\\". <br /> <br />Keep the classics coming Warner Bros. and we will buy.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|The collection is superb.  I am really enjoying my continual<br /><br />stroll back down memory lane.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this collection to all MJ fans.<br /><br />It's the best purchased I made so far, this year.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Essentially all the good songs happen on the 2nd half of the record. The first half is more of the same, the same always being pretty good stuff. Songs 5-8 are real standouts, \\"Octavarium\\" being the best of the album. Keyboard solos pop up more frequently than on previous albums, which for me is a plus. <br /> <br />2nd half makes it a must buy for any prog metal fan.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon's novel is unlike anything written before.  The narrative structure and the perspective in which is told is so unique, so unexpected, that it is difficult to put the book down after one starts with it.    The Curious Incident of The Dog in the Night-Time places the reader in a real special state of mind because it really seems like a book written by this authistic kid.  But let alone the authism and focusing on the writing, it is like if Haddon just took the manuscript from this kid and published it untouched. Other adult novels that are narrated by children can't avoid using elaborated prose and that contradicts the fact that the narration is coming from a kid. And even though they can be really good novels, they can't achieve total realism. But Haddon avoids any language complexity or decoration.  He tells the story using words and describing feelings that most adults don't and can't use or feel anymore because they've past their youth.  But Haddon had seem to retain his youth untouched and this is reflected in this novel.  It is really a great achievement and it wouldn't be exagerating to state that it is already a contemporary classic.
B000AJJNOK|4.0|The Massacre special edition is good value, it has a dvd with all the vidoes to the album plus a new track. <br />However there is one major flaw - only 21 tracks instead of 22, the \\"Outta Control Remix\\" is on here instead of the original as well. For some this might be a good thing but for me it is not, not that the remix is a bad song just the old one was better (and Mobb Deep don't add much to the track at all). Also there is no \\"Hate it or Love it Remix\\", i can understand why with 50's beef with the game and all but hate it or love it remix was the best track on the album!! <br />All in all, the special edition is a better buy than the regular because of the DVD but if your in for the music, go the original massacre - it's better.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Who cares about the lip synching?  The voices are beautiful and everyone with whom I have shared the DVD loved it.  I've watched it atleast 5 times and never tire of it.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is a classic film with high moral tones that serve to entertain the audience. Errol Flynn was a magnificent actor who ranks among the best that Hollywood ever produced.
B000000XCH|5.0|<br />I recently wrote that, of the extremely fertile period that started with \\"Bayou Country\\" and ended with \\"Pendulum\\", \\"Willy & The Poor Boys\\" was my favorite.  But I just listened to \\"Cosmo's Factory\\" for the first time in a long time and, boy, what an awesome album.  Do yourself a favor, buy both \\"Willy\\" and \\"Cosmo\\".  You can't go wrong. <br /> <br />It's clear that, at this point, John Fogerty had been listening to bands like Cream who were pushing the boundaries of how long a rock song could be.  The difference here on two songs, \\"Ramble Tamble\\" and \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" is that the band pulls off the feat of having songs with extended jams that were also catchy and fun to listen to.  (See Neil Young's \\"Down By The River\\" for a similar example around the same period). <br /> <br />The only downside might be the lack of hidden gems.  Almost all of the really great songs here are very well known.  In fact, a whopping seven (of 11) of the songs here turn up on the 20 track Chronicle greatest hits CD.  An exception is \\"Ramble Tamble\\", a track that gets more under your skin after every play.  And lesser known tracks like \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and \\"Run Through The Jungle\\" are excellent even if not among the top tier of CCR's output.  There is literally zero weak filler here.   <br /> <br />I don't care what your age is, if you buy this CD and don't love it, I can't be convinced that you really love rock and roll.
0385512104|5.0|This is a book that should be required reading for everyone who works with, or has frequent contact with mentally challenged people.  It truely gives a different perspective.
1400031087|5.0|I agree that the writing with all the repeats was a bit annoying but while I was reading I could actually feel that this must have been the way he was thinking while he was desparately battling his demons, so he told it like it was. You could almost feel his pain. However I did feel that I wanted to hear more of what happened with Lilly and how he managed to stay clean throughout that ordeal. I highly recommend this book. I am looking forward to reading \\"My Friend Leonard\\"

B0002S94OS|3.0|Don't get me wrong I do like this band with it's raw sound, chunky guitars, and awesome drumming. The only problem is I can't stand the over use of Slayer riffs. Come on guys, you found your sound but lose the the  Slayer touch. Think I'm blowing smoke? You decide: <br /> <br />1. End of \\"Faded Line\\" = \\"South of Heaven\\" <br />2. Beginning of \\"Hour Glass\\" = \\"Reign in Blood\\" <br />3. Beginnig of \\"What I've Become\\" = \\"Epidemic\\" <br /> <br />And so many more but I have become tiresome.   <br />  <br />
B000002UWW|4.0|Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik are the only Peppers albums I ever got into, so there's some good memories on this disc for me. True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, Knock Me Down, The Brother's Cup, Taste the Pain, and Johnny Kick a Hole In the Sky are about it though, everything else here I could do without. So if you don't want to get all their early albums this works great.
0345452585|1.0|I just listened through an unabridged recording of the book.<br /><br />The blurbs should have warned me, \\"...re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions...\\" \\"...Bob Kahn's reading adds suspense to Kellerman's less than original plot...\\" \\"...adds complexity to flat characters...\\"<br /><br />Tried-and-true-and-friggin-predictable-and-boring plot and real flat characters indeed!<br /><br />I know mystery storytelling dates back hundreds, if not thousands, of years and basically every writer retells one of a few storylines in his own way. I have generally liked Kellerman's previous books from the Delaware series. But this one just went on and on without any building up of that tingling under your skin that you expect from a good serial killer thriller. When Kellerman finally decides to cut to the chase (on CD #8 out of 8), the end is a total anticlimax. I don't mind anti-climactic endings - I just saw and liked \\"The Constant Gardner\\" - but the previous seven CDs seemed to building up to an all-out nuclear warfare, and I didn't know when it was time to wake up and hear the fat lady sing.<br /><br />The book does no credit to Kellerman's excellent reputation. Where he tries to add emotional depth to an otherwise tepid story, the dialogue and the little soul-stirring twists fall flat. I mean, come on! Stick to your knitting (or whittling or wordsmithy, whatever), man.
0783226845|5.0|I had seen this movie on screen when it came out and was thrilled by then by the quality of it, and the intensity of emotions. It is interesting to watch it now and see the evolution of the movie indutry through it. <br />It is still a powerful and emotional story about the bonding between a man tired of his own life, and a young fatherless man, so different and still so much thrilled by each other. Their only similarity is in their sense of integrity, and that is the common point that gets them intrigued by each other. The language is quite strong as are the emotions expressed. The Tango scene is still unbelievable. Gabrielle Anwar gives such a sensitive performance in only one scene. This is a collection movie to watch over and over and enjoy!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is truly an all american rock album!  Every track is great and displays the musical maturity of this legendary group.<br /><br />It's not often that I buy an album and enjoy every song...this is a must have.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolat is a wonderful little film that has much to say people, as individuals and as groups. With its exotic yet familiar feel, beguiling music, and focus on truly human characters, the movie stands as an oasis in the middle of the desert we call life. Don't get the idea that this film is boring just because it doesn't feature a lot of \\"action,\\" as there is a great deal going on in the lives of these characters. They are all at a collective crossroads, only it's not really a crossroads because the only real options are to go forward or backward.<br /><br />The setting is a quaint French village which stands starkly on tradition; new people with new ideas just aren't welcome there at all. The best way that I can think to describe the social setting is to say that these are French people being French. There's one self-righteous, powerful know-it-all at the top who tells everyone what to do and how to do it, and all of the villagers are too cowardly to rock the boat or think for themselves. Living in the past is a miserable way to live. You've got an elderly woman still mourning her husband's death 42 years after the fact, a younger widow who won't let her son doing anything because she's afraid something will happen to him, a wife who won't leave her abusive husband, etc. Everyone is so worried about what others might think of them that they don't really live. The mayor is so puritanically dominant that he even writes the sermons for the young village priest.<br /><br />Things start to change when a stranger and her daughter show up (wearing red cloaks, no less) and open a chocolate shop. There's a bewitching quality to Vianne (Juliette Binoche), as she seems to know the right kind of chocolate for each person who enters her shop, and there really is some kind of unquantifiable power in her delicious concoctions. With it, she melts the hardened heart of a grumbling old woman (played magnificently by Judi Dench), puts the romance back into a passionless marriage, and even helps give an abused wife the strength to leave her worthless husband. The mayor and most of the townspeople are not at all happy - and then things get even worse, as a band of \\"river rats\\" settles on the local riverbanks. The whole town just says no to \\"immorality\\" and refuses to serve or have anything to do with the \\"dangerous\\" riff-raff - but Vianne does. She hits it off particularly well with a guitar-playing nomad named Roux (Johnny Depp).<br /><br />Naturally, all of this internal conflict going on inside everyone eventually comes to a climax - and it is here, in particular, that we see both the good and bad side of humanity. There are some really poignant moments as the film draws near to a conclusion, and in the end you're left with something tangible, a renewed spirit. Maybe it's just for a few moments, but you stop and think about the truly important things in life. That's what makes this beguiling little film so special.e, and even helps give an abused wife the strength to leave her worthless husband.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|What DO you say to something like that?  <br /> <br />Well, in the case of this movie collection, you say, darn straight! <br /> <br />This has everything! All 3 Matrix movies, plus an extra 7 DVDs full of information about everything from the mechanics of the film making, to the philosophy behind the films. <br /> <br />Unbelievably full and rich, this collection is the one that I leave out for people to see, not stuck on a shelf next to other collections. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen all three movies, see them with this collection. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. And if you are, please seek help, immediately!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This is one of the most remarkable documentaries that I have ever seen. I thought I new everything about Dylan. I now understand a lot more. I am 57 and have been a Dylan fan for over forty years, and this is the most interesting artistic production I have every seen about him. This includes records, cds, films, articles, coffee-table books, and biographies. I can not speak too highly about this film.
B000002J2B|5.0|This is arguably their best cd. I would certainly pick this as their best. One For The Vine is a wonderful composition. If you don't have this CD, you are missing out on the best of Genesis. Flood on the Rooftops- remind you of something Ju JU ???????
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I can't stand how the Foo Fighter's have gotten their rating down so low because people are rating the wrong thing. Yes, you're reviewing a CD, but you shouldn't bring down a score because you can't put it on your computer. And besides, you can, it just isn't as easy as you want it to be. You can warn people all you want within your messages, but I don't think the copy protection warrants ruining their rating. <br /> <br />Back to what actually counts, this CD is great. I bought it in NY and listened to it on my way home. When I heard the way they had the first song build up from this low noise to this awesome eletric guitars with a booming drumming in the background I knew I was going to enjoy the music. The first CD to me is wonderful and I listen to it straight through everytime. The second CD, all acoustic songs, was a little harder for me to get into, but after listening to it a few times I enjoyed it just as much.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I initially saw this on our local PBS broadcast and was totally captivated even though this is not my usual genre of music.  The DVD was very well put together--the best concert DVD that I've seen that was so well done both musically as well as visually.  As for the CD it has the same songs in a difference order, and I must have listened to this CD a 100 times before I could put it down and listen to other artists.  It's a must have for your collection!
B000002UA0|5.0|Future generations will forget about the stones and the beatles, but will still be listening to Piper.
B00082IJ08|1.0|Another collection of rhythm overloaded, weak songs from a band that has much more talent (I hope) than this disc shows. But, it's a big hit with the trendy playlist crowd so they're making some money, which I hope will not produce a followup clone, but something actually original.   Yuk!
B0007GAEGC|4.0|If you are a particular fan of traditional Celtic music, not crossover like Loreena McKennitt(whom I also love), then you will like this acoustic CD.  The voices are beautiful, melodic and take you to another place.  There are several songs where I feel I'm sitting in an Irish pub, tapping my feet and singing along.  Good CD!
B000060OFT|1.0|I have never in my life had such contempt for a movie like I have for William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.  Whoever thought this take on the timeless classic was worth making should be locked up in a mental institution for the rest of his or her life.  That person is a danger to society!   <br /> <br />There have been modern interpretations of Shakespeare that have worked, and worked well:  10 Things I Hate About You is a new telling of Taming of the Shrew, while O is a reinterpretation of Othello.  Both take the heart of Shakespeare and present it in an all-modern setting and dialogue, and this works to both films' advantage.  If someone wanted to update Romeo and Juliet, the settings and the actors would have benefitted much from snappy, modern, urban dialogue <br />.  It would have been grand. <br /> <br />Instead, we're presented with original Shakespearian words mouthed (badly) by a cast of MTV-wannabes who wouldn't know Shakespeare from Barney the dinosaur!  At fault is the director, who decided that because DiCaprio was on every teen magazine that he should be Romeo.  Bad move.  Did he even check this guy's credits?  Total Eclipse?  Critters 3?  Forgettable movies at best.  DiCaprio has a smug sense that he's so good he can pull off anything, but he clearly has NO grasp of sophisticated dialog, so he pretty much rambles out what he's given and hopes his looks carries it off.  Sorry, Leo.  Don Rickles could do better than you with the part.  Brian Denehey is totally WASTED in a brief role as Montague (I'm sure he's thankful that his screen time is equivalent to an eyeblink--I would be), and the rest of the no-talent cast sleepwalk through a sorrowful script aimed at being too hip for its own good.  Only Claire Danes seems to grasp that she should take something of this seriously, but she, too, starts to flounder badly halfway through the picture.  What with Lady Capulet snorting coke, and Mercutio ranting as if he'sjust been channeling Bobcat Goldwaithe, how could anyone hope to be drawn into this movie?  Terrible from beginning to end.   <br /> <br />The 1968 Franco Zeferelli version of the play, starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, was a classic, and it showed exactly how Shakespeare should be presented.  Lush, beautiful, touching--it is nearly the perfect movie.  Everything it was is what the 1996 version fails on ALL levels to be.  Everything is overblown and plain bad:  set design, music, the opening credits, the closing credits, the cast, the box the movie comes in.  There is no redeeming value to this version save one.  If you want your money's worth, the only was to achieve this is to buy the movie (VHS or DVD), douse it with gasoline or any flammable material, and burn it completely up.  A TOTAL waste of time.  Rent or buy something better--namely ANYTHING ESLE (even a Corey Haim movie--at least you can laugh at it). <br /> <br />A parting thought:  Romeo and Juliet is a sad, tragic play with what may be the first real \\"tear-jerker\\" ending.  Watching the 1968 Zeferelli version, I found myself lingering on the ending wishing there had been a way for the \\"star-crossed lovers\\" to have made it in the end.  What was my thoughts as the climax of Romeo + Juliet approached?  What the hell is Romeo waiting for?  He's got a gun.  Why doesn't he shoot himself?  Poison's WAY too quick!  And go ahead and make sure Juliet's really dead before you off yourself.  (This is NOT how we should think of the play, but this version'll make you do it.)

1400032717|5.0|As a health care professional, I have found it exceedingly difficult to describe autism to inquiring parents.  Paraphrase a textbook and I get nothing but confused looks.  Mark Haddon's novel depicts autism better than any medical textbook or journal that I've ever read. <br /> <br />His past work with autistic children, as well as his obvious gift as a writer, has enabled him to accomplish this amazing feat.  We learn about an autistic teenager's worldview, likes and dislikes, and come away with a better understanding of this perplexing condition.  Highly recommended.
0895260131|1.0|First and for most, I am a Greek Orthodox Christian with a strong background in Middle East affairs, both societial and political.  I have lived and traveled there several times through my life.  I have friends, family, and acquaintences from the entire spectrum of the MidEast world (yes folks, there IS more than one type of peoples living there).  The book is publicized and \\"revealing\\" the true nature of Islam and Muslims, often heavily quoting from the Qur'an and politcal statements from public figures.  If one is to pull statements from a holy book, and use it to stereotypical describe an entire religion and people, let us look as the Judeo-Christian Bible and make sure that we stone to death every wife who cheats on her husband, to remeber that it is not only a \\"sin\\" to lay with another man, but also to eat shrimp....   The point I am trying to make is that an attempt to take a literal translation from a passage from ANY holy book and apply it as a descriptive fact is unforgiveably wrong; if that was that than what do we call a large group of people who drink \\"blood\\", eat \\"flesh\\", offer the children for sacrifice, and spend countless years in a war KILLING, RAPING, and DESTROYING entire nations in the name of a god.... \\"Christians\\".  It is in this vein that we must tread lightly on the light we shed on other's beliefs.  Yes, Islam incorporates many a seemingly violent means to achieve an end, but the same can be said for many religions in South America who belive a sacrifical offering or the filleting of an \\"infidel\\" who help bring about a bountiful harvest.  This book, in light of many recent events, sheds a HORRIBLE image of a truly interesting religion.  While the whole of the Islamic world is reeling from such a strong backlash against them by many after 9/11, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, etc, this should be a time of peaceful acceptance, understanding, and above all, TOLERANCE.  NOT instigating an already horrid situation.  I have seen the comments left by many on this site and it is a vile and deploring to see my fellow American show such prejudice and hatred to a people they might know NOTHING about except what the read and see on Fox News.  Until you experience the Islamic world first hand, to speak with your average joe Muslim in HIS country and HIS \\"world\\" you can NOT make a statement on the totality of his people and religion based on what I begrudgingly call trash [this book].  Begrudgling so, because I have my own beliefs and values, yet am fascinated with learning the views and beliefs of others and learning from my lack of knowledge, while providing clarification for others.  THAT is what the American society is all about.  We are NOT about to revert to pre-Civil Rights movements mentality where its \\"us versus them\\".
B000AXSN5G|1.0|This album is lifeless and trite and all the more so when compared to the rest of the albums in his catalog.  The hype surrounding this album smacks of the same fawning attempts to honor Dylan now that he has entered his washed-up phase.  Like so many other reviewers have stated, buy the old stuff instead, its grittier, more powerful and more substantial-everything that Prairie Wind is not.
0385512104|5.0|This book has really blessed me.  (as did \\"Happily Austistic's\\" review).  Highly recommend.  A very unique read.
B000009DUY|5.0|you will find the whole soundtrack of this wonderful movie except \\"tu es partout\\" from Edith Piaf. <br />I am keeping on listening to it!! <br />Really good...
B00006690H|4.0|This is a good CD, especially when the bad words are bleeped.  It's nice to know that if I want to, I can purchase a CD like this for my son and not feel like I'm corrupting him. <br /> <br />Too bad Eminem has to use any foul language as he is just as talented without them in his music.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this album back in 1997 for the song Paranoid Android only.  Then, little by little I started listening to other songs and said \\"you know, that one sounds good also\\".  Within a month I was in love with all the songs.  Now, 8 years later, I have to listen to this cd at least once a week and I never get tired of listening to it.  It's one of those albums were you can find new sounds that you've never heard before every spin.  Recently, it was voted by Spin magazine as the best album in the past 25 years!  I mean that says it all.   <br /> <br />I guarantee that once you get hooked on this, you won't see other artists the same way.  Be patient and you will be rewarded.  Radiohead = GOD.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I have to, first right off the bat, say that 2005 has been another fantastic year for heavy metal. I have listened to great new albums from Chimaira, Arch Enemy, DevilDriver, Nile, Judas Priest, and among others, but Opeth's latest masterpiece entitled \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is the best metal album of 2005. This album definately has everything a true metal album should have: Amazing vocals, thoughtfully written lyrics, excellent guitars, amazing drumming, need I say more? Martin Lopez's drumming is just awesome. There are times when his drums can be slow and peaceful, and at other times frantic and very hard hitting. Per Wiberg makes his debut with the band here, and what a great way to introduce him. He keyboards just bring such solid depth and beautiful atmosphere, and this album shows it. You've also got great rhythm guitarwork from Peter Lindgren, and nice hearable bass lines from Marin Mendez as well. And last but not least, Mikael Akerfeldt proves that he is an awesome vocalist and an amazing guitarist. His death growls will send chills down your spine throughout, and his clean singing is just beautiful beyond words, and of course his solos are just incredible. Now here's what I think of the songs<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Ghost Of Perdition - 5/5<br /><br />2. Baying Of The Hounds - 5/5<br /><br />3. Beneath The Mire - 5/5<br /><br />4. Atonement - 5/5<br /><br />5. Reverie/Harlequin Forest - 5/5<br /><br />6. Hours Of Wealth - 5/5<br /><br />7. The Grand Conjuration - 5/5<br /><br />8. Isolation Years - 5/5<br /><br />See every song gets a 5 out of 5!<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is without a doubt the album of the year. Buy it now!<br /><br />LONG LIVE OPETH!
0064400557|2.0|Through my many years of reading, writing, playing, watching and whatever else you could think of that involved the media, never have I stumbled across a book so childish that I could call it a true \\"could've.\\" Though this book was memorable in its own right, the storytelling of E.B. White never struck me as \\"amazing\\", more or less interesting. The adventures of a girl and a farm could've been something very fun and interesting, had the plot been less childish. Though the concept of death is very well portrayed, I feel that it is a little too much for those under the age of 8 who have not fully accepted that concept, and though E.B. White has been known to write good books, in my book, he went a couple inches short of a foot.

0375805613|5.0|I read this book expecting a simple children's book, buy instead found an allegorical tale of the effects of unreasonable fear run out of control in society. <br /> <br />Grover is a blue monster, who knows there is a monster at the end of the book. He urges the reader not to turn the page, because he fears the monster that is waiting at the conclusion. His anxiety builds on every page, and the cresendo reaches a climax just before the last page. Then on the last page he discover the truth about the monster, but I do not want to give away the ending. <br /> <br />The author does a masterful job of building suspense, and I would not be surprised to find out that the ghost writer for this book might be a famous author of some renown. The book is beautifully illustrated with full color paintings of Grover and his Sesame Steet surroundings. Some of the book's symbolism escapes me, but I've only read it once. When I have the time, I would love to read this book again.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Christ, it's hard to spell out what makes \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" a great film as so many of it's successes are on a visual scale, but here goes:First of all, several reviewers have attempted to justify Napolean and the other characters as being likable on some level. It's my contention that for a movie to work the primary characters don't have to be likable, just interesting: you could make an entire Star Wars trilogy with Darth Vader as the main character and people would still eat that sh*t up. Napolean is definitely not likable in the sense that you would have wanted him as a playground chum in high school, and neither are most of the characters likable in this sense, but herein lies the genius of the movie: you can watch all these amusingly annoying characters from a distance without the burden of having to interact with them in real life. Everyone out there had someone in school who they thought were interesting in one regard or another, but refused to hang out with them because the other 90% of their personality was out of whack, and it's the same principle with watching Napolean.John Heder's characterization of Napolean has to be commended first and foremost. We're never required to feel sorry for Napolean because he never seems to care too much what anyone thinks; life is merely an endless series of inconveniences rather than humiliations. Perhaps it's this lack of need for empathy that leads some reviewers to dismiss the quality of the film, but personally I feel that a viewer who can only get something out of a movie if he/she can directly relate the characters and events in the movie to their own life is missing out on much, not only in the realm of cinema but most likely the lessons of life in general.If anyone is even more of a geek than Napolean it's his brother Kip, who talks with an effeminate lisp and, at the age of 32, is apparently content to live with his Grandma and talk in chatrooms all day. At this it should be mentioned that the chronology of the film is somewhat confusing: 90% of the visual and plot cues would lead one to believe the films takes place in the 80s -- most of the soundtrack music is from the 80s, Napolean's wardrobe is definitely old school, and the appearance and mannerisms of the auxiliary characters have much in common with teen flicks of the 80s as well -- but here and there are sprinkled references that are decidedly 90s in character -- Kip's use of the internet to hook up with his \\"soul mate\\", for instance, as well as a few other key soundtrack tunes. This isn't a crippling defect, however; there is little about \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" that strives to be a period piece, and if anything the out-of-touch world of his Idaho surroundings portray an existence that time has, for the most part, simply passed by.Of course, all of this would mean little if the characters were merely left to compete for laughs, but what makes \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" work is it's perceptiveness. Yes, many of the characters are stereotypes in a fashion, but high school hallways are filled with stereotypes yet to be fleshed out into distinct human beings, and neither is there an adolescent stereotype omitted nor a false interaction between any of them. All of the characters behave toward each other exactly as you'd expect them to, although it must be said Napolean and the rest of the \\"geeks\\" operate on a slightly more unpredictable scale, largely because they are outcasts living in other peoples' world, and it's not their place to shape events but to react to them. The way that Napolean, Pedro, Deb and even Uncle Rico and Kip adapt to their surroundings may not always seem common, but to the extent that their personalities are developed there is never a false movie between them. The film is mostly episodic, necessarily so as it sets up various scenarios and steps back while it's characters react to them, but as there are no dull moments to wade through \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" can only be considered a major \\"flippin'\\" success.<br />
B000268QB2|5.0|I bought \\"Hopes and Fears\\" almost a year ago after a friend recommended the album. He played \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and I was immediately hooked, and after listening to the whole album, I bought it the next day. I have to say that I still listen to the album over and over. While the piano composition is amazing, Tom Chaplin's vocals set Keane apart from other bands. Whether singing a quiet falsetto or belting his full tenor voice, I haven't heard a lead that can reach the high end of the register so clearly and effortlessly like Keane's frontman. And if great vocals aren't enough for you, Keane's soaring piano lines and epic melodies perfectly complement Chaplin's vocals. Highly recommended.
B00025ETIW|4.0|So which was it \\"SP90210\\"?  The parental advisory sticker or a good friend's suicide that tipped you off to the negative lyrics?  I personally wouldn't mention the sticker first. In fact I wouldn't mention it at all. <br /> <br />I'm calling you a liar because your story is cliche, and your tendencies conflict with your story.  You obviously didn't even think of this little made up antecdote until you were already writing the review.   <br /> <br />You say you were tipped off by a sticker(or was it a friend's suicide) yet you already had the previous album?  It took 4 paragraphs to start mentioning the main source of concern (friend's death)?  A friend died because of their lyrics and you even give a damn to address the \\"catchy tunes\\"?
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This multi-leveled show cannot be faulted. If I had a teen (or child) and wanted to bond with them over a responsible, stimulating show (or anything) I would choose this! <br />And Season 5 is so well written and packed full of (and this is essential for dvd purchases) 'Rewindable Moments' - a line you can't quite believe they said relating to something you only thought you and your friends talk about - or an intricately choreographed event slipped into the background action. <br />In Season 5 Rory, has lost any trace of potentially annoying squat and become more of a flawed grown-up. If you thought her bad-boy boyfriends threw something interesting into the mix, just wait until you meet the fascinating new interest of Logan, who takes us into a jaw-dropping world of what the elite get up to in Connecticut. The added ingredient of this character impacts everything and almost everyone in Rory's life in ways we've never seen before!
B0000000KW|5.0|I think this is just one of the great albums for Ringo.  I was around when the Beatles were a group.  I think he has fared better than ever as a single.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I looked at your reviews.  I must say you're nothing more than an iconoclastic pseudo-intellectual(and your spelling is consistently lazy and atrocious throughout all your reviews). <br />   <br />You gave good reviews to smashing pumpkins, weezer, the pixies, white stripes.....and I stopped there because you clearly just like a particular attitude - it has nothing to do with originality as you purported in your dismissal of 30 seconds' \\"angsty lyrics with distorted guitars\\".   hmmmmm..... that's not smashing pumpkins or weezer..... <br />   <br /> <br />Also, here are a few of your spellings to think about: <br />\\"psudo\\" (ironically a pseudo-word) <br />\\"nonesense\\" (ironically a nonsensical spelling) <br />\\"embarrasment\\" (ironically, an embarrassing misspelling of a third grade level word in the midst of claiming a higher intellect) <br /> <br /> <br />As for the album, it rings of popular hard rock.  Thats right. The chemistry changed slightly and you have a different product.  Its not much different, but it has slightly less of the elements which stuck out most.  But most people are saying that most of the songs are pretty great. <br /> <br />If catchy rock turns one off, this is certainly not for them - but in that case the first one shouldn't have been either. <br />
0786856297|4.0|This book was obviously inspired by HP - instead of being about a boy With a Past who can do odd things, turns out to be a wizard and goes to wizarding school, it's about a boy With a Past who can do odd things, turns out to be a demigod and goes to demigod camp. <br />The parallels run right through the book - he has two friends; a bossy know-it-all girl and a whacky boy with low self-esteem, he has a bunch of eccentric but loveable teachers (including one who doesn't like him much), and he gets to be famous because of something he can't remember (the identity of his father). And there's a group of kids at the camp who are naturally mean (the children of Ares, God of War, as opposed to the Slytherins). Instead of platform 93/4, we have Floor 600 of the Empire State Building (a floor which supposedly doesn't exist). The world of the gods is right next to the world of the mortals, but the mortals don't notice. And so on and so forth. <br /> <br />BUT - and this is a significant but - it's still fun to read anyway. There are plenty of original elements to make up for the borrowed stuff, and the book has a light, fun tone which makes it a good-natured and enjoyable read. At one point there is an obviously deliberate nod to JKRowling - the hero comes across someone reading a book 'with a wizard on the cover', which appears to be thoroughly engrossing. So go ahead and read this book. It's fun, some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, and the pacing is nicely brisk.  <br />This book is an example of the fact that ideas which aren't 100% original can still be fun. When I reviewed Eragon, I didn't complain much about the stolen elements (ie the entire book). Instead, I focused on the fact that it wasn't fun to read. Percy Jackson, by contrast, isn't strikingly original but is still compulsively enjoyable reading. So I'm praising it. Younger people and the non-analytically-minded will especially enjoy it. Dive right in!
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Mr. Young does a nice job this time with the 10 selections. Neil & his group goes back to basics with excellent country rockers in this light collection.

Neil Young, live forever - ROCK ON!
B00001OH7P|5.0|This album is amongst the best I've ever heard. and I'm not a Bowie fan. This album has incredible instrumental work, and they bring in everything from harpiscords to saxophones to make this 11 track masterpiece come to life. Every track is very good, and every track is the highpoint. You don't skip tracks when you listen to The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, you just don;t, it's like cheating yourself if you try too. Bowie's vocal work on this album inparticular really stands out, it;s great. I have to say that without contest, this is his best album. His best of Bowie album wan;t even helf as good as this. This album is a musical monument, and it's achieved a perfect sound.<br /><br />PEACE!

0800135954|3.0|Set in Montana, the story centers around Tristian, played by Brad Pitt. His wild ways and fierce love for his family have a ripple affect on the whole story. He has two brothers the responsible Alfred, and the awkward and naive Samuel engaged to a lovely, but weak Susannah. Though both Alfred and Samuel are just nuts about her, she truly yearns for Tristian.  <br /> <br />When Samuel dies, it changes everything. Alfred confesses his love, but she goes after Tristian. It's hard to pinpoint Tristian's feelings for Susannah. He's clearly attracted to her, but you get the sense that he's not IN love with her the way she is with him. Despite marrying her, he takes off to parts unknown to resolve his grief and restlessness, leaving Susannah abandoned. Though she still loves Tristian, (a point that she doesn't even try to hide) she marries Alfred, and tries to be content with him. <br /> <br />When Tristian comes back, he learns of the changes, and oddly, doesn't seem to mind. He has regrets, sure, but one get's the feeling he's secretly relieved he's rid of Susannah. He's more interested in Isabel, the beautiful half indian girl who grew up loving him. Of course, Susannah still has feelings for our wild Tristian, which will lead to her downfall. <br /> <br />This is not an epic, and it's certainly not legendary. Yet it is a moving tale of love both requited and unrequited, the strength and weaknesses of family, and the senseless tragedies life throws at us. Some things don't measure up, though. Everyone except Isabel and Hopkins are immune from aging, and there are some unanswered questions. Overall though, I reccomend it as a rental or something to borrow from a friend who is on VHS or DVD.
B000AADYYO|5.0|What is there to say about Opeth? If you've ever even heard of Opeth, you know that what makes them stand above the rest of the metal scene is their incredible ability to show such dynamics in their music, while remaining tasteful and charming with their masterful musicianship and beyond beautiful poetic lyrics. <br /> <br />I could type out a 30 page essay on this album, but I wouldn't really help. Rest assured, I can tell you that Mikael Akerfeldt's unbelievable vocals, and spellbinding lyrics will be more impressionable than anything I can type.  <br /> <br />Standout Tracks: Ghost of Perdition, Reverie/Harlequin Forest

1400032717|3.0|Autism is in the news a lot these days. It seems to have become the malady-du-jour as ADD and bipolar-disorder orders were a few months and years ago. PLease no not take this observation as poking fun at the people who suffer from these maladies, it is simply a comment on the media's \\"discovery\\" of them.<br /><br />This book is written from the point of view of a teenager who is autistic. The word autism never appears in the book but anyone who has worked with autistic children anywhere on that spectrum will instantly recognize it.<br /><br />The book is a putative detective story. The story-teller discovers the neighbor's dog murdered with a pitchfork in the middle of the night and resolves to investigate the murder and solve it. Since he is autistic, his investigation takes on some unique aspects and we are treated to the way an autistic mind works.<br /><br />This kid is particularly good in math, so he chooses to number the chapters by using only prime numbers. In between the development of the story line (and in which we get to discover a lot of different things in addition to who murdered the dog!), we get all kinds of tangential descriptios of this kid's life. It really helps in understanding the way modern life looks like to an autistic kid. I was particularly impressed with his description of a trip in the London Underground!<br /><br />If you are interested in autism, this is a great read. If you are not, then you will find it too different from the typical murder mystery.
B00002IJ48|5.0|This video collection is awesome.  The variety is great. The home videos give some insight into \\"regular guys\\" with GREAT talent who are a little uncomfortable in front of the lens (except when they are performing).  In other words, you can tell that, with them, it's definitely about the MUSIC.  And they did some of the very best made in the nineties (and looked awesome doing it, from the female perspective).  Highlights include Grind, Again, We Die Young, I Stay Away, and Rooster.  I highly recommend this collection to any AIC fan.
0312962118|5.0|This is an outstanding book! It has a wonderful combination of a fasciniating and exciting espionage story, viewed at times in a wonderfully nostalgic background through the eyes of Anna Khorev. The novel also takes us to some fascinating areas of the world, and describes them beautifully. I whole-heartedly recommend it. The plot is primarily set in the post-war USSR, where the CIA have plotted to kill Joseph Stalin (Operation Snow Wolf), the mission being coordinated by Jake Massey, who enlisted the aid of Alex Slanksi and Anna Khorev, with the KGB under Levrente Beria attempting to thwart them at every opportunity. The characters are well developed, as are the relationships between them. And, in spite of its length, the novel remains fast paced, and addictive. I couldn't put it down.
B000AL730O|5.0|Apparently it was at George Martin's recommendation that Paul bring in Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich to produce Chaos & Creation. Good call by George! Godrich and Paul have delivered a fantastic album. This definitely ranks as one of McCartney's best solo efforts and one that will be enjoyed for many years to come.

055357342X|5.0|After reading Tolkien, Hobb, Goodkind, Jordan, etc..., I feel like Martin falls in a slightly different genre due to his themes/plot/character development(or lack of development A.K.A. death). <br /> <br />Tolkien, Goodkind, and Jordan fall into pure fantasy category based solely in a made up world where good guy wins all the time and eventually saves the day.  These books are \\"pure\\" because frankly they have absolutely no grounding in reality and in our(average reader's) life.   They are created for a third person objective, non-empathic view... sort of like floating above Midlands, Middle Earth, etc.  I can't say much for Tolkien but amazing since he is father of genre AND a good writer.  As for Jordan and Goodkind, I have two quick critisms.  Does it take freaking 10 books to get to climax in a story, I mean really, wtf? Secondly, how can one man(Goodkind) fabricate a story 8-9 time and keep have people buying it?(I guess his stories are like drugs and people who keep reading it need to detox) <br /> <br />Hobb and Williams fall in between fantasy and fiction, but much more towards fantasy.  Both authors give us characters who we don't watch from above in the sky, but sit next to and observe like the extras in films(there but not really there). I feel like there is less separation between reader and characters because both authors have a few faults in main characters unlike the saints in Goodkind and to lesser degree Jordan. <br /> <br />Finally, Martin falls more towards fiction than fantasy, but fantasy aspect still exists.  With Martin's characters, they are so fleshed out and real that you can almost imagine being them with their insecurities and fears.  They have both good and bad traits, and even those with lots of good traits die JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE.  I emphasize that point because that's why I say this book is more fiction than fact.  The grittiness of book and downright depravity reflects the life of most people(the poor and the politicians).   <br /><br />I give this book 5 stars because I prefer the fiction to the fantasy aspect of it.  I like that people die, and not everything is perfect because that is how life is.  If you don't like your life and want an escape, then read Tolkien(but if you are reading this, you sure as hell probably already read him).  If you have alot of money,time, and patience, perhaps risk reading Jordan or Goodkind, but I wouldn't suggest it as writing style is mediocre at BEST. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002HJD|5.0|I'm biased because I love anything that came from Jim Morrison, but this album is poetic, creative, flowing and haunting. Spoken poetry with music interludes. There is a certain feel to it that sticks with you.
B000002KKS|5.0|What makes a good album is not just great melodies (which this album possess )But lyrics with depth. This Black Sabbath album is the best outside the Ozzy Osbourne era because of this reason. As a matter of fact the lyrics of this album is deeper and more thought provoking than all previous albums. Consider the lyrics in this song Children of the Sea \\"We sailed across the air before we learned to fly We thought that it could never end We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run<br />Now it seems our world has come undone\\"  With Ronnie James Dio, the lyrics and melodies of Black Sabbath got to a better direction because of depth. It is no wonder that credible music critics say that this one of the best albums (if not the best) Black Sabbath has ever made. So for those who don't own this keep an open mind and buy this album its worth your time.
B000669GAI|4.0|I am not dissapointed that pearl Jam's softer songs are on the second cd not the first. To me, Pearl Jam is at its best when it rocks hard on songs like \\"Alive\\" \\"State of Love and Trust\\" \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Dissident\\" \\"Corduroy\\" and \\"I Got ID\\".  <br /> <br />Also, the fact that there is more Pre-Vitalogy material on Disc 2 than Disc 1 is not surprising: in my opinion, the Post-Vitalogy period offers more interesting \\"softer\\" numbers such as \\"Off He Goes\\" than the Pre-Vitalogy period which, with the exception of the majestic \\"black\\", has too many commercial ballads such as \\"Daughter\\" \\"Nothingman\\" and \\"Betterman\\". <br /> <br />Arguably, this compilation does not offer all of Pearl Jam's best work to date, that being found on some of the later albums but on the other hand it does include numbers which are harder to find \\"I got ID\\" \\"Breath\\" and \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\". <br /> <br />I did not find the re-mexing of the Ten numbers that necessary and I can understand why some people say the sound quality is bad. The songs on Ten sounded great as they were. There was no need to \\"crank them up\\". That is a loss. <br /> <br />For price-value, it is a good buy...but then again, these days, it is quite easy to find cheap Pearl Jam albums, so it stands proportionate. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is exactly what it claims to be: \\"a Greatest Hits\\" compilation, nothing less and, it stands, given the strong song selection, as a worthwhile compilation.
0440237688|3.0|I just finished reading The Giver a few days ago and it was really good. I found it entertaining yet disturbing at the same time. The fact that everything is so perfect is almost scary. Jonas, the main character is faced with so many things after he turns Twelve. That's what kind of made it disturbing to me because in my eyes Twelve is still a child, yet in this book they are treated as adults at this age. The Giver himself was like an omen of what was to come for Jonas and I think that's what sets this book apart from any other like it. I really liked this book and I found that I couldn't stop reading it until the end...which was sort of disappointing to me because I have so many questions. <br />-Alicia Ladue <br />Chicopee High School

B0009S4IHY|5.0|Fresh from the worldwide triumph of Shaolin Soccer, Stephen Chow surpassed its critical and commercial success with Kung Fu Hustle. He took the winning formula he perfected with his previous film and elevated it to a more ambitious scale. He also wisely decided to have Sony distribute his movie in North America instead of Miramax who notoriously bungled the release of Soccer. The results were a modest success because, unlike Miramax, Sony knew how to market Chow's movie.<br /><br />As he did with Shaolin Soccer, Chow uses CGI in very clever ways to express his ideas visually. The action sequences play out like live action Looney Tunes cartoons as he playfully pokes fun at over-the-top, pretentious action spectacles like The Matrix: Reloaded. Kung Fu Hustle is bursting at the seams with one hilarious visual gag after another. In one scene, Sing is chased by a grumpy, bossy peasant woman and they chase each other through the countryside like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Chow understands that the enjoyment in watching his movies is reveling in the visual spectacle of them. His movie has the visual inventiveness of ten movies.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a movie about other movies. It playfully quotes from such diverse movies as Spider-Man and The Untouchables. One of the pleasures of watching this movie is to see what film it references next. Meanwhile, Kung Fu Hustle continues to top itself with one breathtaking action sequence after another, each one building up to the penultimate showdown. Chow's movie is so eager to please, such an unabashed celebration of movies that it makes the ones that come out of Hollywood every year look boring and outdated in comparison.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Stephen Chow, actor Lam Tze Chung, Axe Gang advisor Tin Kai Man and actor Chan Kwok Kwan. If you're reading the subtitles of this track it is near impossible to figure out who's talking and so you just have to go along with it in the hopes that some relevant information will appear on screen. They go into detail about the filmmaking process in this informative and engaging track.<br /><br />\\"TV Special - Behind the Scene of Kung Fu Hustle\\" is a 42 minute look at how this movie came together hosted by two of the film's stars. This is an entertaining and well-made featurette that is a step up from the usual fare that populates DVDs.<br /><br />There are two deleted scenes that feature the residents of Pig Sty Alley trying to convince the two kung fu masters to save them and more footage of Sing's initiation into the Axe Gang.<br /><br />\\"Ric Meyers Interview with Stephen Chow\\" is a nice conversation between the two men. He talks about some of the cinematic influences on this movie as he comes across as a very smart and articulate fellow.<br /><br />Also included is an \\"Outtakes and Bloopers\\" reel that is a very funny collection of blown lines.<br /><br />There is also an impressive collection of 15 TV spots!<br /><br />Finally, there is an \\"International Poster Exploration Gallery\\" that features all sorts of different designs adopting various styles and colour schemes.elevant information will appear on screen.

B000067CPX|5.0|An album that stirred quite a controversy when it was released, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \\"By the Way\\" is quite a shift, particularly from their early work.  In many ways, the band's entire career has been leading up to this album-- their development of ballads and melodic songs (starting as far back as \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\"), Flea's decision to abandon slap bass on \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magick\\", the move towards guitar-driven (as opposed to bass driven) rock with Dave Navarro on \\"One Hot Minute\\" and of course the return of John Frusciante on \\"Californication\\".  It seemed as if that album was also beginning to embrace not just the sounds of L.A. punk and metal but also the pop of Brian Wilson and the stylings of Charles Mingus.  The result is nothing short of stunning, and while many fans will let loose accusations of sellout, the album is shockingly brilliant.  Shockingly different, yes, but it is in my assessment the band's masterpiece. <br /> <br />The opening title track catches attention immediately, starting with the clean toned chorus and then bursting into the funk/punk verses.  The choruses build vocal harmonies each time they're repeated until it's a total wash of harmony.  By the end of the piece, it's clear something changed.  As the album develops, it proves surprisingly eclectic, seemlessly tackling pop (the superb \\"Dosed\\" with Frusciante and Kiedis trading lines on the chorus), funky metal (\\"Can't Stop\\"), Latin rock (\\"Cabron\\") and the Beach Boys (unnervingly brilliant \\"Tear\\"-- check out Frusciante's falsetto).  Along there's an alt-rock masterpiece (\\"Don't Forget Me\\"), analt-pop gem (\\"Universally Speaking\\"), an achingly beautiful ballad that should have been a single (\\"I Would Die For You\\"), a straight L.A. rock song (\\"Minor Thing\\"), one betraying a folky influence (\\"Warm Tap\\") and a closing suite that manages to somehow summarize the entire album and be pretty much the best piece on the record (\\"Venice Queen\\"). <br /> <br />So with this much variation, it would seem there should be a lot of room for failure, but the truth is, the whole record is fantastic, start to finish.  I'm not normally one to gush endlessly about an album, but three years since its release, \\"By the Way\\" still captures my attention, is still the Chili Peppers album I most often reach for, and still stands up as singular and unique.  Newcomers should start with this one, it really is far and away the best thing the band's ever done.  Highly recommended.

B000A0GP0Y|2.0|Longest Yard is a decent comedy for a lazy night when you don't have much else to do. There is actually a better film buried underneath all the MTV-style glitz and bull, but the filmmakers tried too hard to ensure that no clich&eacute; or gimmick went unused. We get an uneasy mish-mash of a real film with real actors (Cromwell, Fitchner, Reynolds, etc.) and a cheezy music video with rappers (Nelly) cameos of pro wrestlers (Stone Cold, Goldberg, etc.). Another big problem is the terrible casting of Adam Sandler as a pro football star and overall tough guy. Hello! The guy is too small and fragile-looking to play in a high school league, let alone the pros. Everyone else in the film literally towers over Sandler, including even the old warden, making him look even more puny. This was vanity casting at its best, and probably reflects Sandler's own self-indulgence more than any credible casting decision. When the lead character is so poorly -- and ridiculously -- cast, it's hard to manage enough suspension of disbelief to actually enjoy the film.

B000148KK2|5.0|I was surprised that CD didn't get very high reviews. True, it is a different from her previous stuff, so if that is what you are looking for in this CD, you might be disappointed.  However, I love all of Diana's previous music, and I thought this CD was her best yet.  It's more jazzy than her previous \\"mainstream\\" type music.  Most of the songs are slower, soulful and smooth, unlike some of her more upbeat songs in the past, but she does it well.  Also, she wrote several of the tracks on this CD, including The Girl in the Other Room (title song) and Almost Blue, which are very \\"jazzy\\" and great songs.   Departure Bay and Narrow Daylight are just beautiful songs, too.  I love every single song on this CD, and I've listened to it almost exclusively since I got it.  Do yourself a favor and give it try!

B0007XT7V8|3.0|If you were to describe the ingredients needed to make Theory of a Deadman, you would need: One serving STP(CORE)+ one serving of Nickelback and just a pinch of Soundgarden.  This CD took me back to the early days of STP with the mixed songs going from headbanging rifts to the soothing sounds of acoustic guitars.  This CD is no different.  Hello Lonely sounds like a track from Nickelback with powerful vocals in the chorus.  I threw in Soundgarden, well, youll hear it when you listen to the CD.  Every once in a while I swear its like listening to Superunknown.  I rate this 3 stars based on the number of songs I can tolerate, being only 2.  The rest of the CD is much like a food you dont like but must eat... its an aquired taste.  Its unfortunate that in the past 5-8 years nothing original has come out.  Groups like STP, Pearl Jam, Collective Soul and others set the standard and are now being copied to no end.  Thats basically what this disc is, STP, Nickelback and a dash of Soundgarden.  Recommend buying the single for Hello Lonely, thats it.

B0006L5RT2|5.0|I have to admit, this album hit me like a kick in the nuts. I had never heard of James Blunt, and I was not expect much when my brother talked me into giving this album a listen.  <br /> <br />I am absolutely amazed with this guy's music. It is fun and lively, yet the lyrics behold such a powerful emotion, I literally get goosebumps everytime I hear certain tracks off the album.James has pioneered his own original style that stays consistent from track to track, yet each song has its own attitude. Listening to this album definitely a breath of fresh air, a glistening pool of water in a drought of good music. Really the only complaint I can come up with is I wish this album was longer. <br /> <br />Usually when I write a review for an album, I will list my favorite tracks, but for this album I honestly cannot pick favorites. Get this album and get ready for a new experience in music, a journey of sound. You will not regret it. <br />
B00005ASHM|5.0|If you have never heard Pet Sounds, if you don't think that Brian Wilson is a genius, if you think that the Beach Boys songs are tripe and silly marshmallow fluff, then you are beyond help.  This is a celebration of joy, sorrow and everything in between.  It cannot be explained how and why this is the way it is, much like trying to establish the existence of God.  Yes, it's there, but it's not something tangible enough for everyone to understand.  But if you aren't prepaired to take that leap of faith and just believe because you want a life of happiness and ease, then no one can reach you.  Rubber Soul was the inspiration and Sgt. Pepper's was the answer, but this somehow remains a hiden treasure. <br /> <br />Pet Sounds speaks to each and every one of us.  It might not sound very original today, but remember that no one had ever done what Brian had done before.  Brian was trying to say something to us then, trying to give us a personal statement about his own insecurities and feelings.  No one had ever done it before.  Many have done it since, but remember, cool people, you never would've known to do it without Brian.  Brian's work has since been overshadowed by lawsuits, fights within the Beach Boys, Brian's mental illness and his becoming a shattered recluse.  But he overcame it and emerged.  If you don't love Brian and Pet Sounds, you just don't undertstand.  I am blinded by my love for him and this album and have given up a long time ago trying to convince people that Brain is a genius.  Perhaps someone will even give me a negative comment or two on this forem, but I wanted an opportunity to gush. <br /> <br />So if I have inspired anyone by my glowing review or made anyone turn away in disgust, do your homework and listen to this album.  Then be the judge.

B000003TAL|5.0|Basically, Sonic Youth is one of those bands that came along and made an album that Started Things. I feel sad that I was born a few years too late to ever really see them perform or get caught up in all the Sonic Youth-fever. Oh well. <br />Buy this album if you like music that makes you sit there and say things like \\"whoa\\" when you hear it. <br />Buy this album if you want to understand what the big deal is - and trust me, you will understand. <br />But this album if you want music where you discover something new about it every time you play it. <br />Buy this album if you want to just tell people you have it. <br />Whatever you do, just buy this album. It's totally worth it. It will change your view on music and the world, and when people ask you \\"what's that tune you're humming\\", you can just give them a hipster look and say, \\"Sonic Youth, of course...\\"  <br />
0553573403|2.0|Okay, I'll be one of the few to go against the crowd on this one. This was an incredibly tedious book to read. I am no lightweight reader. I first read Tolkien when I was 8 and I have read a very broad range of both fiction and non-fiction. This book was like trying to eat a whole buffet of cardboard. Sure, as some people point out, there is lots of the \\"grittiness\\" that makes it seem more realistic. But he made everything SO gritty that it got boring after a while. (And besides, in fantasy fiction, I don't necessarily WANT realism. That's why I read FANTASY). There were some characters that had decent development, but there were a lot more that seemed like they were thrown in for more grittiness. And ultimately, I felt that the plot was not advanced very much throughout the book. I understand he was trying to create a richly detailed world and all that. But \\"richly detailed\\" does not necessarily mean more pages of description. And more pages of going through people's every thought. I felt he could have gotten the same effect with the story and the characters in less than half the pages if he was more succinct in his writing.<br /><br />Bottom line: Somewhat good reading if you are looking for something better than Terry Goodkind's drivel, but it will be rough-going to slog through to the end.
0553382179|5.0|Gee, I thought no one understood ME til now!   <br />The FLYLADY has some great tips on how to change the chaos into calmness (relatively speaking).I must say that she is the best motivation to tackle those jobs one bite at a time instead of trying stuffing the whole elephant into your mouth at once.  She just keep encouraging to help you slowly change those bad habits you have slowly fallen victim to, rather than expecting an overnight miracle.  (I''m still  nibbling at that elephant.)
B000AA305M|5.0|This is one of the best cd's this year in my opinion. There is not one bad track on the cd. David Gray is an excellent song writer/singer, he has so much emotion in his music. Alibi and Lately are two amazing tracks. Also The One i Love and Hospital food are equally well done. My favorite track has to be From here you can almost see the sea, it makes me feel like i can almost see it also, to be able to write and compose one great song is an amazing thing, but to be able to do it consistently and on a whole cd is astonishing and David Gray has done it.
B000AYQNYI|5.0|At first I was a little hesitant about buying this album AGAIN. Have had it on Cassette since the day it was released, it was one of the first CD's I ever bought, bought the remastered edition a few years ago, just because (duh!) and when I was shopping for HAND, I saw this was going to be released the same day, well, of course had to pick it up. WOW WOW WOW. The original CD side is better than even the remastered version from a few years ago. And the DVD side? WOW WOW WOW. At first I was lost cause the Stereo mix was exactly the same as it always has been. Then I discovered the Surround 5.1 mix. WOW WOW WOW Makes me want to go and buy an even better stereo system. You HAVE to listen to the new versions and extended versions of some songs and like everyone else, my all time favorite Jovi song is NSG and the new intro???? Makes me pray they do this version on tour this year! WOW. Maybe it's a treasure that Obie's been hiding all along! Darn you Obie! <br /> <br />Like another reviewer said, don't even think twice about this one. Buy it. You WON'T be disappointed. You owe it to yourself if you are a true Jovi fan.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|I've only listened to this recording twice so far. I like it a lot, but I don't think two listenings gives me the right to make stone-etched pronouncements. Go to the NPR website and listen to the 9/17/05 interview with Neil Young and you'll get an idea what this recording is about. His father had a terminal disease; Neil had planned to take his dad on a trip back to their family homestead in Manitoba before he passed. These songs were written with those thoughts and plans in mind. The album was recorded before they were to leave. Sadly, Neil's dad died before they could do the trip. The album is dedicated \\"For Daddy\\". It's just a peaceful, easy-going, tribute. Neil also had some serious health issues while recording. But what a way to be remembered by one's son. A Golden. Glorious. Memorial.
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|First, this is a great price for what you will be getting.<br /><br />-A concert<br /><br />-A Music live CD<br /><br />-Behind the Scenes tour.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />The concert DVD isn't made very well. It's a lot like their music videos, with quick cuts from one angle to another. Hard to enjoy the concert, its more like watching a music video.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />You do get different angle viewing if your dvd player has such capabilities.<br /><br />You pay 5 bucks more than you would for a regular cd and you get the concert and live recording of the concert.<br /><br />Get to hear two unreleased songs - \\"Moses\\" and \\"See you soon\\"<br /><br />Overall, very worth it, but be prepared to be disappointed in the concert dvd.

B000AL730O|2.0|Like plenty of other Beatles fans, I eagerly awaited the release of Paul's most recent effort. I had heard Driving Rain (and caught the tour, which was quite good) and enjoyed it well enough. Considering Macca's age and the number of albums he's put out, it seemed a decent effort with a handful of solid, catchy tunes. Sure the lyrics weren't good, sure at times he sounded out of his field, but there were some classic McCartney melodies in there. Reading the reviews and pre-release stuff surrounding this album, I was excited. Paul being emotionally honest in his music? Paul being experimental? Paul playing all the instruments? Paul being challenged by a colleague for once, rather than given free reign? Sounds like the Paul that disappeared sometime after Ram, resurfaced on Band on the Run, and went into a pot-smoke haze for the next thirty years. Chaos and Creation..., apparently, changed all that. <br /> <br />'Fraid not. This album, quite simply, isn't very good. It isn't very good for McCartney, it isn't very good for an artist of his stature, it wouldn't be very good for a new artist, and it certainly doesn't live up to the hype and the promises at all. First and foremost, there are almost no good melodies on here. \\"Fine Line\\", the single, is catchy and classically McCartney with some \\"We Can Work It Out\\" style lyrics and is a welcome addition to the catalogue. \\"Friends to Go\\", supposedly a Harrison tribute, also is rather memorable. But outside of that, I can find nothing to get excited about here...I've listened to this five times in two days now, trying to find something to get into...but I just can't. All the songs suffer from the same slow tempo, weird major/minor shifts, occassional \\"experimental\\" sounds, and-most importantly-boring melodies, when there are any. I can't even distinguish one song from another, looking at the track last. With Paul, you could always count on, if nothing else, a great tune. On his great works, it was a beautiful melody-something that, like \\"Hey Jude\\" or \\"Let It Be\\" or (dare I say it) \\"Yesterday\\", seemed to have been around forever, something so perfect that it was hard to believe someone had just recently thought of it. Obviously Paul can't rewrite those songs again, but that quality permeated almost all of his work. It was certainly present on Driving Rain. But somewhere, here, in his struggle to appear deeper, or more serious, or more mature, or simply different from the same-old-thumbs-aloft-Macca, he lost that touch, it seems. I don't want him to keep writing happy pop songs, and I give him credit for attempting more \\"serious\\" themes in his music again. But previously, those themes were augmented and communicated by his innate musicality-see \\"For No One\\", \\"Junk\\", to name just two. That's gone here. It's hard to believe this is the same man who wrote anything on \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Let It Be\\" or \\"McCartney\\", etc. Hell, at times it's hard to believe this is the same man who wrote \\"Driving Rain\\". <br /> <br />Part of the blame should perhaps be given to Godrich, who sounds as though he was trying to pressure Paul to do something new and different, and push him to greater heights. That's all well and good, but if this change is down to his influence, he made the wrong choice. Nobody wants to hear Paul pontificate about friendship over some unmemorable string of notes and weird chords for 5 minutes (the lyrics here suck, by the way. Without the melodies, you pay more attention to them, and, uh...try not to). Some people have said \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is a highlight. Well, perhaps if you enjoy Paul complaining about people being unkind to him, then, yes. I've nothing wrong with that, however, so long as he makes it musically worthwhile, something John, interestingly, always did during his \\"confessional\\" period (69-71). Perhaps Paul could have taken a leaf from his old partner's book on this one. Something,  at any rate, is missing, and it's a big something. <br /> <br />I think Paul wants to prove he can make music like he used to. Hell, like the Stones still do. \\"A Bigger Bang\\" isn't a perfect record, but somehow Mick (and Keith) managed to balance good old fashioned rock-and-roll with some honest, mature numbers, with-crucially-a dash of melodicism thrown in. How ironic the the Stones wrote the more musically enjoyable record. Times have changed. Perhaps Paul still has it in him, but this record leaves him with more to prove than ever.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I finally saw the musical Wicked as it came through Denver this past weekend.  I was completely blown away.  Stunned.  It was nearly perfection.  Such a great, creative spin on the old story.  I found Elphaba twice as compelling as Dorothy.  I had to buy the soundtrack while I was there.  I have not stopped listening to it since.  Wicked is full of fun, playful, beautiful music.  Easy to sing along to and harmonize with.  It was the best production I have seen on stage, and this recording takes me right back to the play like I am there.  I get to relive it all over again.  \\"What is This Feeling\\" and \\"Popular\\" are such energizing, exciting tracks, and \\"Defying Gravity\\" is the perfect Broadway catch song.  All the songs are great, but those three are my favorite.  Honestly, I am not sure if I would love this CD if I had not seen it live, but then, that is true with most musicals.  Wicked is a must have for any theater and show tune lover!
B000063DHL|5.0|This is probably the best I.M. album of all time ,piece of mind is a close second.the theme is about space and time, and they get away from the death and evil stuff ,that im sick of.  But recently Ive been listening to Bruce Dickinsons solo stuff, and its even better than Maiden.

B00011F5DK|5.0|My mom purchased this game for my children after seeing a group of kids crowded around it at a \\"mom and pop\\" type toy store.  My parents, my kids (ages 12 and 9), my husband and I LOVE this game.  We've owned it about a year now and every time someone pulls it out we all jump in to play.  It teaches and helps with spatial reasoning, logic, hand eye coordination, concentration, strategy.  It's a wonderful game that I would recommend to anyone!
0783226845|5.0|This visual work sustains its weight in Al Pacino, that it shows its better \\"vision to us\\" incarnating a blind person. I do not speak single of its performance, but also of his characterization at an extremely close level, to the point to feel it in our skin. <br />  Be or not an unconditional follower, you must have this film. Since without a doubt, it is the best performing than it has done until now.
0143034901|4.0|This was a great book.  I loved all the characters, especially Fermin. It was recommended to me by a bookstore employee.  I bought it because I didn't want to make him feel bad.  I was hooked right away.  It's not the type of book I would have bought on my own.  I loved reading the history of the characters and the way they all finally entwine with each other.  Highly recommend.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Dylan is probably the premier American poet post-1960. His songs shimmer in a way that most songs do not but that poems can, and are boosted by his own performance of them, as the fine live selections picked for this film demonstrate. His oft-mocked drone is not in evidence early in his career, this film's focus.<br /><br />Some reasons suggest themselves here about why Dylan met with such enthusiasm. He entered a folk scene by its very nature about people performing the work of other people, i.e. all those \\"folks\\" whose music was being rediscovered. So when Dylan began writing his own stuff, instead of just imitating Woody Guthrie, he automatically set himself beyond his peers.<br /><br />This was an era when young people were musically starved. The pop scene was lean from 1958 - with departure of the first wave of original rockers variously to death, scandal or the Army - to the emergence of the Beatles in 1963. That's why a niche music like folk music could gain as much steam as it did. Dylan, writing with real lyrical power, got better notice at a time when his major competition included Fabian. His fans were the college crowd - people in college, just out of college, or about to go to college. But now, American college enrollments were exploding. If he'd been born 30 years earlier he probably would have been forced to work for a living. (Like all those folks folksingers sang about.)<br /><br />Today's Dylan seems in the movie refreshingly void of BS, reflecting matter-of-factly upon his life and times. Much of the mystery attributed to him way back when, was bull to begin with, something he may very well have never sought or meant. Many parties were at fault:<br /><br />--The fans who, worshipping him as an oracle, expected him to be oracular offstage, which he neither was nor wanted to be.<br /><br />--The starstruck who parsed his every word and action for deeper meaning, like the one who presses him for the real message behind the shirt he's wearing on the cover of Highway 61 Revisited. (Dylan tries to answer him honestly - \\"hey, it's just what I was wearing that day, I didn't give it that much thought\\" - but the fan won't take that for an answer.)<br /><br />--The reporters who would ask him whether he was the Voice of a Generation. How could anyone answer that kind of question? If he said yes or even no, he'd seem unbelievably vain. How would he know? Who picks the Voice of a Generation, and how do they let you know? The movie contains a great clip where a reporter asks sonorously how many real folksingers there are. Dylan says, \\"136.\\" The reporter has no idea he's being put on, and presses Dylan on the number. Dylan then says, \\"142.\\" Much of what Dylan said, deemed enigmatic by the wide-eyed, were just goofs told when no straight and sincere answer existed. This says more about the naivete of the public at that time than it does about him.<br /><br />Alienated young intellectuals found deep meaning in the outrageous, ever-changing lies Dylan told about his past, whether he claimed to be a cowboy, carnie or whatever. They neglected the obvious: as a 20-year-old college kid from a proper, comfortable small-town, middle-class Jewish home, he didn't have much of a past. Hardly anyone does, at 20. And so, he was trying on personae, as young people will. Folkies uncritically ate it up because they themselves were naïve, credulous, middle-class college kids rejecting their own backgrounds by singing songs of sailors, miners, Oppressed Negroes and Irish revolutionaries - of those, in other words, from as far away as possible in space and time from Levittown.<br /><br />Too fixated on his being the Voice of a Generation, the world failed to notice obvious reasons Dylan did what he did. He quit playing folk because the scene got old, and because he wasn't the Pope of the Folk Church of Idealists Struggling for the Oppressed. He was a songwriter who put truths into song as well as anyone ever did, but who was ultimately in the music business,  something inexplicably deemed shameful by folkies. He moved to rock because it was popular - the masses actually preferred electrical guitars to acoustic ones - and because in its exploding musical possibilities circa 1965 it offered more creative room than three-chord folk did. He faked his motorcycle accident because the pressures of pop stardom became too much to bear. And because, in his late 20s, he really wanted a normal family life. His kids, quoted in a recent bio, say he was a pretty good dad.<br /><br />His milieu couldn't bear to imagine that someone could make these choices - a career? a home life? kids? Quel horreur! - or that this shows how smart, normal and well-grounded Dylan actually was. He walked away from folk music because he got tired of being deemed the Voice of a Generation by teenage depressives and other naifs. And he walked away from the same rock star pressures that drive lesser celebrities to drugs or other self-destruction.  Sounds pretty sane, and not really very enigmatic, to me.y folkies.

0805076476|3.0|Fight Club is one of the rare instances where the movie might actually be better than the book.  Of course I'm only talking about situations where the book came first.  Books taken from movies aren't worth the space they fill on the shelves of airport drugtores.  Anyway I digress...I stil recommend reading the book first though as I think it would of been aa 5 star book had I not already seen the movie.  It was really hard not to always picture Pitt, Norton and Carter as their respective charcarters.  Also already knowing the ending takes away one of the best aspects of the experience....especially if you have read other Chuck before. <br /> <br />I would rank Fight Club as Palahnuik's third best book behind Survivor and Invisible Monsters but better than Choke and Lullaby which are stil good books.  Fight Club would be a good place for someone looking to get into Palahnuik's books as you can just sink into his style as the movie helps you follow the plot.   <br /> <br />Bottom Line: If you haven't seen Fight Club then I would highly recommend this book...otherwise it's reserved for current or potential fans of Chuck.
B000059Z8J|5.0|After discovering the tragic fate soon to befall his own planet, Kryptonian scientist Jor-El and his wife Lara send their only son, the infant Kal-El, to the distant planet Earth in a small spaceship, knowing that its atmosphere and the rays of its yellow son will bestow upon him powers and abilities far greater than those of its inhabitants. With his vastly superior knowledge and gifts, Kal-El will have a great advantage over the people of Earth, veritably insuring his future, but with great power comes great responsibility, to borrow from a later comic book icon. It will be Kal-El's lifelong duty to help and guide the people of Earth, to be a savior to them in times of crisis and a role model for them as they go about their daily lives.<br /><br />Whether prearranged by his father, Jor-El, or completely by a stroke of terrific luck, most likely the former, baby Kal-El's ship crash lands in a field in the Rockwellian town of Smallville, Kansas, just as a kind, salt-of-the-earth, regretfully childless farming couple is driving down the nearby road. Jonathan Kent and his wife, Martha, at first don't know what to make of the strange discovery, but the toddler seems to be the answer to their countless prayers for a youngster of their very own. The couple raise the boy, instilling in him their strong values of goodness, courage, faith, humility, love, loyalty, truth, justice, and the American way. Everything seems picture perfect for the Kents and their adopted son, who they have renamed Clark, until Jonathan Kent passes away of a heart-attack and a strange glowing object calls to Clark from the barn. It is this event from which the now 18 year-old Clark Kent, also known as Kal-El of Krypton, learns that he must finally leave his gray-haired old mother and travel north to find his destiny, and so he does.<br /><br />In the isolation of the cold, bitter north, the green, glowing crystal Kal-El found that night on his Smallville farm helps him to create a new home. Not a home for his mild-mannered Earthling identity, Clark Kent, but a home for his new persona, the mighty hero known as Superman! After twelve years of learning from the crystals that contain all his parents' knowledge of mankind and the universe, Superman emerges as a god among men, with skills even greater than he ever knew he had before: Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! Right away, Superman makes his presence known to the world, even as he is just settling into his new home in the fantastic city of Metropolis, and his new job as a reporter with The Daily Planet, a beacon of truth and hope across the globe. All seems to be going well with Kal-El's new existence in the hustling, bustling Metropolis, with new friends and coworkers Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane in Clark Kent's life, not to mention the stern but fatherly Perry White, the Daily Planet's editor, and Superman making a name for himself as the city's own high-flying guardian angel. Things are about to get more complicated, though, as a maniacal criminal mastermind named Lex Luthor plots to wreak havoc from his secret underground lair. While Superman shuffles his heroics and reporting schedules to fit in time for courting Miss Lane too, Luthor is busy laying out a plan to sink Los Angeles into the ocean, making his recent desert land purchases immensely more valuable as the NEW west coast! Realizing Superman is the only thing that can stand in the way of his devious scheme, Lex and his bumbling cohorts research and discover the only way to kill the Kryptonian man-of-steel, green Kryptonite! With this deadly weapon now in their evil arsenal, even Superman may not be able to save the day!<br /><br />In 1978, producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind set forth to make a movie like no one had ever seen before: A big-budget comic-book film called \\"Superman.\\" Their idea was a tour-de-force of camp, but the director they hired to do the job, \\"TheOmen's\\" Richard Donner, had a different sort of film in mind. Richard, who was hired to shoot both Superman and Superman 2 simultaneously, knew that if the film was to work, it had to be a completely believable and engrossing story of one man's struggle to make a difference with the talents giving solely to him, not a feature-length joke about the comic book hero genre. Locking in big names in the roles of Superman's father, Kal-El (Marlon Brando), and arch-nemesis Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), Richard set the groundwork for a film that could be taken seriously, rather than just shrugged off as a kiddie flick. While an incredible team tackled the problem of inventing groundbreaking effects for a film that was abundant in the fantastic, and completely without the aid of CGI, Donner went on to the difficult task of casting his leading man and lady. He found perfection in the forms of a young Christopher Reeve and a feisty Margot Kidder. With Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, and even more high-profile names rounding out the stellar cast, made to glow by the stunning lighting and camera work of Geoffrey Unsworth and the incomparable music of John Williams, the final package was nothing short of a masterpiece! \\"Superman: the Movie\\" was a fantastic success, spawning three sequels, the sister-film \\"Supergirl,\\" and securing the last son of Krypton's place as a pop-culture icon from now to the end of time!<br /><br />On DVD, \\"Superman: the Movie\\" looks fantastic, and the double sided disc is loaded with extras! With deleted scenes, trailers and TV spots, three 30-minute documentaries on the making of the film, a music only track and additional, alternate music tracks, a readable legacy of Superman, cast and director filmographies, and some highly entertaining screen tests featuring a variety of Lois Lanes (Anne Archer made quite an appetizing Lois), this truly is a special edition! The disc is capped off with a great feature commentary by director Richard Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz, who give a passing mention to everything from the film's clear parallels to the life of Jesus Christ (a theme continued through Superman 2, which puts its own spin on the New Testament's Book of Revelations), to personal differences between the cast and crew! It's quite an interesting listen! Whether or not an even MORE special \\"Special Edition\\" of \\"Superman: The Movie\\" will be released soon to hail the coming of the new Warner Brothers film \\"Superman Returns\\" is unknown at the time of this review, though it is quite likely. After all, this is the only one of the Superman feature DVDs with any extras worth talking about, and the definitive Batman film \\"Batman Begins'\\" DVD release next month will be accompanied by an all new set of Special Editions of the four previous Batman films. It would only seem natural that the Superman films would follow suit, and, make no mistake, \\"Superman: The Movie\\" will always be the definitive Superman film!<br /><br />As for those 3 sequels, despite Richard Donner having been fired from directing \\"Superman 2\\" by the difficult and unappreciative Salkinds, the first Superman sequel is actually nearly as good as the original film! Plus, since Donner DID shoot much of \\"Superman 2\\" while working on the original, you have that same fantastic cast, including Gene Hackman returning with his despicably hilarious (yet not campy) take on super-villain Lex Luthor.  \\"Superman 3\\" is painfully underrated, and not a bad film by any means, with Richard Pryor making up for the loss of Hackman, and a lovely pre-Smallville(TV series) Annette O'Toole in the role of the adult Lana Lang. It also features some great \\"Evil Superman\\" stuff! \\"Superman 4: The Quest For Peace,\\" written by star Christopher Reeve, is easily the weakest of the three. It is often ridiculed for its flying effects and bleeding-heart storyline, but it is still watchable and mildly entertaining to less demanding Superman fans. As for the \\"Supergirl\\" movie,, had a different sort of film in mind. Richard, who was hired to shoot both Superman and Superman 2 simultaneously, knew that if the film was to work, it had to be a completely believable and engrossing story of one man's struggle to make a difference with the talents giving solely to him, not a feature-length joke about the comic book hero genre. Locking in big names in the roles of Superman's father, Kal-El (Marlon Brando), and arch-nemesis Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), Richard set the groundwork for a film that could be taken seriously, rather than just shrugged off as a kiddie flick. While an incredible team tackled the problem of inventing groundbreaking effects for a film that was abundant in the fantastic, and completely without the aid of CGI, Donner went on to the difficult task of casting his leading man and lady. He found perfection in the forms of a young Christopher Reeve and a feisty Margot Kidder. With Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, and even more high-profile names rounding out the stellar cast, made to glow by the stunning lighting and camera work of Geoffrey Unsworth and the incomparable music of John Williams, the final package was nothing short of a masterpiece! \\"Superman: the Movie\\" was a fantastic success, spawning three sequels, the sister-film \\"Supergirl,\\" and securing the last son of Krypton's place as a pop-culture icon from now to the end of time!     On DVD, \\"Superman: the Movie\\" looks fantastic, and the double sided disc is loaded with extras! With deleted scenes, trailers and TV spots, three 30-minute documentaries on the making of the film, a music only track and additional, alternate music tracks, a readable legacy of Superman, cast and director filmographies, and some highly entertaining screen tests featuring a variety of Lois Lanes (Anne Archer made quite an appetizing Lois), this truly is a special edition! The disc is capped off with a great feature commentary by director Richard Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz, who give a passing mention to everything from the film's clear parallels to the life of Jesus Christ (a theme continued through Superman 2, which puts its own spin on the New Testament's Book of Revelations), to personal differences between the cast and crew! It's quite an interesting listen! Whether or not an even MORE special \\"Special Edition\\" of \\"Superman: The Movie\\" will be released soon to hail the coming of the new Warner Brothers film \\"Superman Returns\\" is unknown at the time of this review, though it is quite likely. After all, this is the only one of the Superman feature DVDs with any extras worth talking about, and the definitive Batman film \\"Batman Begins'\\" DVD release next month will be accompanied by an all new set of Special Editions of the four previous Batman films. It would only seem natural that the Superman films would follow suit, and, make no mistake, \\"Superman: The Movie\\" will always be the definitive Superman film!     As for those 3 sequels, despite Richard Donner having been fired from directing \\"Superman 2\\" by the difficult and unappreciative Salkinds, the first Superman sequel is actually nearly as good as the original film! Plus, since Donner DID shoot much of \\"Superman 2\\" while working on the original, you have that same fantastic cast, including Gene Hackman returning with his despicably hilarious (yet not campy) take on super-villain Lex Luthor.  \\"Superman 3\\" is painfully underrated, and not a bad film by any means, with Richard Pryor making up for the loss of Hackman, and a lovely pre-Smallville(TV series) Annette O'Toole in the role of the adult Lana Lang. It also features some great \\"Evil Superman\\" stuff! \\"Superman 4: The Quest For Peace,\\" written by star Christopher Reeve, is easily the weakest of the three. It is often ridiculed for its flying effects and bleeding-heart storyline, but it is still watchable and mildly entertaining to less demanding Superman fans. As for the \\"Supergirl\\" movie, it's a shame it wasn't more successful. I can't say much for the loyalty to the comic books, my superhero fandom comes more from television and movies than anything else (my comic collection is mainly Disney and Star Wars), but I find this much razzed film to be enjoyable as a popcorn flick, and Supergirl is just hot. I own the boxed set of the Superman films and the 2-disc release of \\"Supergirl.\\" While I may lean a bit toward the Dark Knight in terms of favorite superhero, I have always been a Superman fan (followed by Spidey and Hulk), and am addicted to the current WB television incarnation, \\"Smallville.\\" For those of you who enjoy this film, I highly recommend that show, and don't get me started on the hotties it features. I also recommend the wonderful WB animated series, now available on DVD, and the classic Fleischer short cartoons from the 1940s! All fantastic stuff, and just a taste of what's out there! Why, even Krypto the Superdog has his own show now!
B000003S0I|5.0|The overuse and consequent misuse of \\"classic\\" in reference to popular music has cheapened the word by elevating the mediocre.  A \\"classic\\" once possessed an enduring relevance, immune to cultural change.  Now cultural change occurs in weeks, not years; and advances in recording formats now confer the title of \\"classic\\" to anything released on CD for the first time.  Not only does this serve to rescue from irrelevance most 70's music, it places the 30th anniversary release of King Crimson's Larks Tongues in Aspic in danger of being considered a \\"classic\\" imposter.  But time only has enhanced this recording and the appreciation of its bold direction.  That makes it a genuine \\"classic\\" in the classic sense of the word.<br /><br />Led by guitarist Robert Fripp since its inception, Crimson's most cherished trademarks included the music's dynamic range and its always slightly-altered lineup.  For this sixth album however, Fripp chose a brand new crop of players; two notables and two relative unknowns.  The much-publicized additions of drummer Bill Bruford, suddenly departed from Yes, and Family bassist John Wetton created renewed enthusiasm for the new Crimson among the rock press, Crimson's fans, and the group itself.  And besides Bruford's and Wetton's energy, creativity, and strength as a rhythm section, the improvisational skills of violinist David Cross and avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir would have a profound impact on this and subsequent incarnations of Crimson.  Bruford, in particular, has often spoken of the influence Muir had on his development as a percussionist.<br /><br />The album offers two approaches: On the song \\"Exiles\\", a glimpse of where the band had been, and on \\"Lark's Tongues in Aspic\\" parts one and two, an ample, powerful preview of where it was headed.  Lark's Tongues in Aspic harkens to when LP records were created and enjoyed with the experience of listening in mind; listening from beginning to end in one sitting.  Indulge.  That the music satisfies and challenges after 30 years will renew your faith in \\"classic\\" rock.usic satisfies and challenges after 30 years will renew your faith in \\"classic\\" rock. <br />
B00005JMXX|5.0|All I can say to this movie is 'WOW!!!\\" I must admit I'm not usually into mainstream Hollywood movies but I love a good disaster flick, and this one doesn't disappoint. <br /> <br />So okay, there is the predictable plot, carbon-copy characters and dialogue to make you squirm, but the special effects are amazingly brilliant. To see New York flooding and freezing over is an awe-inspiring site. <br /> <br />This movie is made all the more poignant by the current destructive weather occur in the US and in other parts of the world. After viewing this you would have to ask yourself \\"Have we brought it on ourselves???\\" <br /> <br />If you love a good disaster flick, you will enjoy Day After Tomorrow. <br />
B000AJJNPY|4.0|With only a couple of exceptions, this albums simply \\"sings\\".  The compositions are sumptious and make such good use of piano, strings, percussion, synthesizers and human voice in a wonderful harmonic fusion.  Bjorke is so different and yet somehow also recognizeable in Sigur Ros.  I think there seems to be an Icelandic style and it's terrific.  It may sound homely but this music really gets you on the train to work in the morning! Saeglopur, Hoppipola, Takk and Glosoli are by far the best of the songs on the album but the rest are pretty good too.  (I just wish I spoke Icelandic to appreciate it more.)
B00005J6T0|5.0|After 2 hugely successful albums, what was Madonna to do???? Bring out more of the same??? NO!!!!! With her third release True Blue she went into a completely different musical direction.    Her first 2 albums were dance and synth-pop orientated, but for True Blue, Madonna went for a cleaner sound. Less synth and more natural instruments.    Beautifully crafted pop songs throughout, several of which are now a part of pop culture.     This album was the one that made the world really stand up and notice the music as opposed to the image.     True Blue was the first album that Madonna had complete control over. She co-wrote and co-produced every track. If she had hired the big producers of the day to write and produce this, perhaps she would have faded soon after. This is her soul on here.    Madonna has always known how to make good musical moves, and True Blue proves this.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I am so sick and tired of you people buying into all of the lies that Michael Moore spreads about Bush.  If you people actually paid enough attention to the actual articles and footage he used in this movie (the unedited ones I mean), you would see he is splicing together bits and pieces to trick you.  Do yourselves a favor for once and do some research on the so called \\"facts\\" that Moore presents to you. <br />Haven't you people even listened or read about the 9/11 commision's report which has practically debunked every theory Michael Moore has given to you.  And I do mean THEORY!  It's one man hating republicans ORDERING you to do the same. <br />What's worse is you people talk about how Bowling For Columbine was so much better and so much more truthful.  Even Michael Moore can't get the facts straight on that one. And if that's not the worst part of the whole thing, check out what the kid's who got shot in the Columbine incident had to say about being tricked into being on film. <br />These are not facts that he is stating in these two movies.  They are snippets of facts.  Trust me, the truth is out there.  Just not in Michael Moore! <br />THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS: WAKE UP AMERICA AND STOP BELIEVING WHAT THIS HOT AIR BALLOON IS LYING TO YOU ABOUT!!!!!!
B000AXSN5G|5.0|The thing is, people always like to compare one set of work against another. In the case of Neil Young's body of work, you can't compare anything to Neil, not even old Neil. There is a continuity, but its also like reviewing a new artist---cause you don't know what Neil you will get, or if it will be a brand new version. Prairie Wind offers a familiar yet still fresh Neil. It has songs I think will be classics, at least three. I use two tried and true measures of how good any new Neil is: can I sing along with the tune the first time I hear it, and does it make me break out in a big smile. Lines like \\"Bury me out on the prairie/where the buffalo used to roam/you won't have to shed a tear for me/cause then I won't be far from home\\" sung over a background of Neils harmonica and punchy rhythmic acoustic, squarely meet my test. As a UK reviewer said so well \\"Few have the balls to wreck a melody the way Neil Young does.\\" Godfather of grunge, grandfather of North American music. I just can't wait to hear what the next Neil will sound like.  Neither can my kids.

Damian, seems to have matured quite a bit on his style after what seemed like a bit of searching on his first and more so on his second album.  First time I have to say - \\"Wow\\" on his albums. :)    If you havent had an album by him yet - try this one before his first release (Gong) or Tree...  (IMHO)    Thanx,  Shannon
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Using Amazon is very easy.  My daughter and I enjoyed watching the DVD and especially the outtakes.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Well, Neil Young has graced with yet another album in his long, well-documented career. And while \\"Prairie Wind\\" might not be his best, it is a noble, heartfelt effort.  <br />Upon first listen, I must admit I was a little dissapointed at the lyrical content and wistfulness of the album. Sure, the songs are catchy, but there is nothing that compares to the goosebump-raising opening to \\"Old Man\\" from Harvest or even the joy of something like \\"Cripple Creek Fairy\\" from After the Goldrush. It seemed as if Neil was indeed getting old and growing slightly too reminiscent. Where's the lyrical genious of \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\" or the anger of the Greendale? All of these forementioned cons aside, I can totally see why he looks back on his youth after the roller-coaster type of year he's had.  <br />Prairie Wind starts off with \\"The Painter\\" a nice, slow acoustic number that features some great steel guitar work by Ben Keith. It's a good song, it won't end up being classic, although to chorus is pretty catchy. <br />\\"No Wonder\\" is one of the strongest songs on this album, with its fast, hard-core countryish sound. The writing on this song is quite strong, with references to 9-11, Willie Nelson, Chris Rock. \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth,\\" while not representing anything new, is a wonderful, little heartfelt melody. The soft, acoustic lick, the background singers: everything clicks on this radio-friendly tune. \\"Far From Home\\" is an okay and funny, little jazzy number that fits better when you listen to the album in its entireity as opposed to standing on its own as a single. <br />\\"It's A Dream\\" is probably my favorite tune on the album. It's stirring, heartfelt and made beautiful by the string section. It's a long journey of a song which will be remembered for many years. The title track and \\"Here For You\\" are also nice little odes by Neil that flow with the albums feel. <br />\\"This Old Guitar\\" and \\"He Was The King\\" are the two weakest tracks, in my meager opinion. I realize how important the guitar is to Neil, but the riff way too similar to \\"Harvest Moon\\" which was a track that I've always felt was overrated (I know the \\"it's all one song\\" argument...but still). The opening to \\"He Was The King\\" also strongly resembles the riff of \\"Piece of Crap\\" albeit in acoustic form. It's a fun song though. <br />The album closes strong with \\"When God Made Me\\" made famous at Live 8. The gospel singers, the gentle piano, the questioning lyrics... all is quinessential Neil Young. <br />All in all, it's a solid album. Personally, I found Greendale to be more audacious and enjoyable, but comparing Young albums is like comparing to apples to oranges and I am sure he wouldn't ever compare the two. I've heard the complaints about there being horns and strings on this album, but it's nothing he hasn't done before (Think \\"After the Goldrush\\" and \\"Comes a Time\\"). The guitar licks aren't classic like on the mellow Harvest and Comes A Time albums, but it's a valiant effort, especially considering how quickly it was put together. It's not everyone's cup of Neil Young, but it is the commerical audience's.
B0000669JL|4.0|One reviewer had the audacity to say \\"and you can't even dance to this music\\".  WHAT?!  Funny,I have NO problem dancing to it.  Maybe the reason you have such a problem dancing to it,is because you CAN'T dance!!
B000A7S4B0|3.0|This one's low key, but catchy.  Howl has a spiritual, gospel-like sentiment to it though the lyrics are blue and tormented.  The songs repeat their refrains too often, not unlike church hymns, but the lyrics in the refrain don't merit repeating.  The lyrics need a little work and the lead singers vocals are a bit nasal (trying to be like Bob Dylan?).<br /><br />It's more folky than rock and roll.  An interesting combination of gospel and folk at times, which I like.  Underneath the piano, harmonica and vocals, you have a dense bass and electric guitar that growl below the radar.  I think they could have drove these catchy hooks a little harder with a more pronounced rock sound.  Alas, they weren't going in that direction.  Rather they were looking for a more meaningful, thoughtful sound than previous efforts.<br /><br />For example, I really like song #4.  It reminds me a lot of Led Zepplin 3's harmonica, electric and acoustic blend.  It's a folksy-rock song in that sense, but it just doesn't break through the surface and grab you.  Wishful thinking, but it could use a Jimmy Page guitar solo in there.<br /><br />Similarly, I like #8.  It's very catchy, but when the rhythym and solo guitar finally go off, it is only to end the song.  Seems like they could have done a little more with it.  Could have taken that rhythym and beat and drove that baby home!<br /><br />With a name like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, I expect loud guitars with meaty drums and bass, like a Harley's engine.  BRMC have all this power they are sitting on, but when they crank the throttle, the muffler stifles the flow.<br /><br />Howl is a catchy and eclectic album, but it needs a little more work.  I give it three and a half stars!
B00008DDSC|4.0|An office romance?  Maybe, in a fun, distorted way.  James Spader and especially Maggie Gyllenhaal are supurb in proving that you shouldn't assume the position that the power exists with the dom in a dom - sub relationship.  It's erotic and darkly humorous - very entertaining.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a Sci Fi fan for over 40 years and must admit that traditional popular Sci Fi shows such as the  \\"Star\\" thing-a-ma-bobs (like  Star Trek to Star Wars to Star Gate)  have lost their appeal because of over domestication of its honorable warrior aliens and save-the-world plots. All the formally great shows like those  have evolved from shows with unique aliens and story lines to episodes with human centric invaders and aliens. The story lines got boring and the tame aliens were taking themselves too seriously to be considers serious Sci Fi. I was losing interest in Sci Fi and figured the era of unique Sci Fi had gone the way of the dinosaurs.  <br /> <br />Then came  Fox's best kept secret:  Firefly.  <br /> <br />Why is it the best kept secret? Well, I only saw one commercial years ago about the series airing. However, I am a busy person; and for about two years, I could not find the show and forgot about it until it appeared on the Sci Fi channel less than a year ago. If a die hard Sci Fi fan like me and my friends couldn't find the series even when we looked, then  Fox could have advertised much better than it did. Sadly enough, Fox did us Sci Fi fans a disservice in not getting the message out. Had enough of us known about the series when it first aired, we could have blown the ratings out of the blackhole where Fox promoters hid Firefly so deeply.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I was hooked on the show on the first showing. There are no aliens of which to speak, which makes it a little Asmovian (aka Isaac Asimov), but that is all right. The characters are down-to-earth people trying to survive as best they can in an environment hostile to most. The actors are natural in the roles and have great timing in delivering some of the more humorous lines. <br /> <br />The Wild, Wild West theme and the characters trying to survive works well in this context. However, the appeal does not stop there. Being speakers Chinese as a second language, my family and I particularly enjoy the scenes where the characters interject Mandarin Chinese into their dialogue. One scene in particular that I found endearing was when the doctor referred to his little sister as \\"Mei, Mei\\", which is a tender Chinese term for \\"Little Sister.\\"  <br /> <br /> The writers must be geniuses to incorporate a language, which more than a billion people speak today. It made me wonder about the marketing possibilities of the show overseas, but I digress.  <br /> <br />To continue, the injected humor based on the imperfect nature of people, the establishment, and the universe make the series not only more entertaining but also truer to what we might expect of the future where humanity is still exists. You would find nothing like this in the perfectly ethical Jon Lu Picard or his Federation in the Star Trek: Generations, where everyone and everything takes themselves too seriously.  <br /> <br />To conclude, I can only hope that the release of the movie Serenity will revive the series so more Sci Fi fans can get a chance to enjoy this Space Western know as Firefly. I am just afraid that it may be too late to change the minds of the Fox decision makers, who probably never watched the series or really cared enough to check the reason why this show wasn't getting the ratings they wanted. Well, the simple answer is that no one told us about it. If the show really does get cancelled in the end, it will be our lost; and that is a shame.   <br />

Mr. Kiyosaki has a knack of restating the obvious, and obscuring or changing the way some facts are presented.   <br /> <br />Is the american public really full or morons who can't differentiate between a liability and an asset?

B000AL730O|3.0|\\"Chaos And Creation\\" doesn't grab me like I had hoped it would. Amazon and the local papers gave it pretty nice reviews... so I figured I'd try it. I was born in early 1960's and got into the Beatles in the mid 70's when I was old enough to know good rock and pop tunes (and smart enough to stay away from disco). Okay, I admit it, I still like the Beatles old stuff much better than any of their collective solo efforts in the past 20 years. Ringo's solo stuff, outside of a few good hits, was mostly bad. George's solo stuff hit and miss. John had many a great hit, but never had one solid song-for-song album while with Yoko (sorry, Yoko destroyed more than just the Fab 4). Paul on the other hand had several good solo releases. \\"Band On The Run\\" will forever be classic. Nothing he will ever do -EVER- will surpass it at this point of his life, and mine for that matter. \\"Ram\\", \\"McCartney\\", \\"London Town\\" and \\"Venus & Mars\\" all follow as his 2nd best studio albums. Paul's had several modern releases (1990's and newer) that have been average at best... \\"Run Devil Run\\", \\"Driving Rain\\", \\"Flaming Pie\\", \\"Off The Ground\\", \\"Flowers In The Dirt\\". I'll put \\"Chaos\\" above these modern releases, but not by much. The first \\"Chaos\\" track is \\"Fine Line\\" - it's the best song on the album and it opens the session wonderfully. It's also the first deserving hit - and with good reason. It's a great melody and good lyrics. Track two, \\"How Kind Of You\\", follows and it gives you the feeling it's kind of an 'ode to Linda' (or his current wife) song. Thirdly, the acoustic \\"Jenny Wren\\" follows like an old Beatles tune (I have \\"Blackbird\\" from the 'White Album' in mind). Track 6, \\"English Tea\\" is a happy playful piano/recorder song. The rest of the album just blends together... most of being fairly mellow. Dare I say that not another hit will emerge from \\"Chaos\\". It's a good album, but nothing that stands out and says \\"Own me - Now - Or else!\\"! A few years from now, you might hear 2005's hit \\"Fine Line\\", but more than likely everything else will be destined for the elevator or dentist office. My take: If you're a fan of Paul's latest 90's work, I'm sure you'll enjoy this album more than I did. If you're a Beatles fan and a solo Paul fan from the 70's, you may think this is average Paul at best.e\\", but more than likely everything else will be destined for the elevator or dentist office.

B000001FRY|4.0|For those familiar with U2 only as the larger-than-life superstars responsible for socially conscious anthems such as \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" \\"One,\\" and \\"Beautiful Day,\\" their debut album Boy should surprise.  It's their most rocking album (their latest, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, is really pretty timid), their most apolitical, and their most energetic.  The young U2's energy, enthusiasm, and ear for a good song more than make up for any lack of musical refinement (The Edge in particular seems to be having a whole lot of fun on the guitar, while never getting too technical).  This is their best album of the `80's (along with 1983's War, but that's another review), besting even The Joshua Tree in terms of strength and consistency.<br /><br />Boy's most recognizable song, \\"I Will Follow,\\" begins the album.  If there were one song to define U2's energy and optimism at this point in their careers, this is it.  \\"Twilight\\" includes one of The Edge's best guitar solos ever; it's so simple yet so evocative of the pensive mood of the song.  \\"An Cat Dubh\\" is the album's high point.  It's a very dark song, with a fantastic instrumental finale (that also serves as the beginning of \\"Into the Heart\\").  Adam Clayton's bass and Larry Mullen Jr's percussion really shine here.<br /><br />Other highlights include \\"Stories for Boys\\" and \\"Out of Control\\" (U2's first single), two great hard rockers.  \\"The Electric Co.\\" is a great jam piece, and \\"The Ocean\\" provides a nice, calm change of pace.<br /><br />What might be the most valuable thing about Boy is it's picture of U2 as a very young band, free of any spotlight, making energetic, earnest music.  This is essential for any rock music collection.

0811836363|5.0|There are way too many books about The Beatles, and this one is by far THE one to have. Culled from interviews exclusively for the book (and in Lennon's case, the lengthy interviews he gave over the years), it builds a story about 4 guys who came from nothing, worked hard, and changed music.  <br /> <br />Like most authorized bios, its weakness is in glossing over the less savory moments in the band's history, but the rare photos and amount of material and stories told by the four that is included more than makes up for it.  <br /> <br />This is something that will take time to read, but don't let the size and amount of pages fool you, either.  <br /> <br />Because it is part of a bigger package that was put out at the same time the video documentary and 6 CD set, combined together, they are as definitive as you can get about The Beatles. <br /> <br />I'd recommend the hardcover over the paperback version only because it will last longer, but the price of the paperback version is great for what you get.  <br /> <br />I had recently seen Bob Dylan's \\"Scrapbook\\" in the store, and hope that The Beatles will put something similar out.  <br /> <br />Pete Best and Cynthia Lennon have written books that offer their insights to the early years that I think are worth checking out. \\"All You Need Is Ears\\" offers George Martin's insight to the Fabs. Mark Lewisohn and Bruce Spizer have also written books that are the \\"go to\\" reference books if you are into collecting or want to know when a particular session happened. John Lennon's \\"A Spaniard in the Works\\" and \\"In His Own Write\\", Ringo's \\"Postcards From The Boys\\" and Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\" are also worth checking out.

It is reminiscent of the oldest advice in the world, given by our mothers and their mothers and so on.  It's so basic and so true.  It can be hard to accept in this modern era. We are hard wired a certain way. These are timeless facts of life.  I've been around long enough to instictively known when a guy was just not that into me.  It's the brain that gets in the way and tries to drown out the small voice that knows the truth.  The delivery of this subjest is laugh out loud funny.  If you can see the simplicity and the truth in it, you can be free to re-set the bar and find this elusive love you have been looking for and deserve. Great page turner.
B00005JNNZ|1.0|Out of all the ideas someone could have come up with to spend money on, why in the world would they decide to make ANOTHER \\"sports will help kids\\" movie?!  Hasn't this been over done?  Not only is it unrealistic (the fact that one man can make such a huge difference), but the plot is really really retarded.  If I was forced to watch this movie again, I'd most likely rip my eyes out and and stuff them in my ear holes.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Wow. The musicians, the complex rhythms, the hardcore screaming, the melody. How can a band this skilled get so little attention? <br />... <br /> <br />You didn't think I was being serious, did you? This is a disgrace, even for Nu-Metal. I could create better melodies by smashing my keyboard with a chair. :/ <br /> <br />Well, maybe I'm exagerating. Atleast it's better than their previous releases. That's not saying much, mind you. <br />Obviously they had to change their 'music' to fit in with today's music. It just means more money for them. <br /> <br />Even most Slipknot fans, the dumb breed of people that insist to be called 'maggots', seem to dislike this record. Probably because this cd has 2 acoustic tracks on it, so it won't be sufficient to shock their parents anymore. What were they thinking? <br />Or maybe it's because most of those 'maggots' claim that this is their sell-out album. The fact that their first cd had 2 MTV videos doesn't make it a sell-out album, but 2 acoustic tracks do? Good logic. <br /> <br />But that's to be expected of people that yell \\"SIC\\" and worship a 9 member band wearing rejected halloween masks.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of the best movies that have been made recently that proves that there is still gold in them Hollywood Hills. With all of the below average films that have been released in recent years, it is nice to know that some of the movies are still worth watching and are destined to become legendary. Gladiator is one of those films.<br /><br />Every single moment of the film is pure brilliance and the story really does come to life. The tale of revenge and jealousy is one that never gets old and that's what makes it work, besides the incredible acting from everyone on here.<br /><br />Many films have since tried to capture what this movie has but have never been able to. Excellent
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is really one of the best novels I have read yet. Just by the way that the author imagined a world where everyone is the same, they eat the same, they wear the same clothes, and they have no real emotions. You can even imagine this fantasy world can exist within our everyday life.     Jonas was a boy living his life in the normal way like anyone would in his town, only just to find out on his Twelfth year that his life is about to change forever. It shows in it's realistic-fantasy way that he was experiencing what we all go though around his age. Our lives change just like his did; normal in the beginning and then it seems like our lives are in chaos near the end of the change.     I couldn't put the book down after I first read it. I really do give this book five stars!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Greenday is awesome, just awesome. <br /> <br />This is an awesome offering!  <br /> <br /> <br />American Idiot, St.Jimmy, Wake me when September Ends, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Jesus Of Suburbia are worth the price of this stellar, stellar, album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Well Worth it!
B000001Y79|1.0|No Doubt combines the pouty vocals of bleached-blond, obsessive poser Gwen Stephani and her three garage-band-quality sidemen. The music is pop-based pablum. The lyrics too, are utterly juvenile. They either deal with the priorities of a spoiled 13-year-old schoolgirl or refer to poor Gwen's busted affair with Tony what's-his-name (No Doubt's Indian bass player). This is music for the pre-pubescent crowd, many of whom are fanatical fans of Gwen, the make-up queen. If you're an adult and are looking for something with a semblance of sophistication, move on.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I am an avid Sex and the City watcher. I've seen every episode more then once, but own only one season, the first one. The only reason I have that is because it was a gift. This is one thing i'd be willing to invest in. I never bought them individually, because yea, they're too damn expensive. It's ridiculous. But I also know, that if you wait long enough, prices will go down or oppurtunities like this will arise. So yea, it sucks people spent so much money on all these seasons, but if you think ahead for things like this, it'll be worth your while.  <br /> <br />I never buy any dvd at full price. I'll wait a few extra weeks when Target has it on sale for $10 or some other store has it for sale price. Patience people. Patience. <br /> <br />
1402581386|5.0|Being fond of alliteration, and finding the synopsis of interest, I had previously read this book.  While I found the first few pages a little slow, I loved the book.  I purchased the audio version to share with a friend.  I was a bit concerned about hearing someone else read it after I've already \\"heard\\" it in my head while reading it but it wasn't a problem.  It's extremely well read, the dry wit and pauses are perfectly done.  The story is a bit dark but I loved it and couldn't wait for the author's next book (the recently released \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\").  The story flows, certainly holds your interest and this version can't be beat.  Take a chance on this author.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Just watching Eric Clapton play guitar again, just to jam on stage with himself, a drummer and bass player has been a rare sight to see over the last 35 years.  This is why the man was declared GOD back in the 60's during his stint with the Bluesbreakers, cause he could play.  He played like a GOD with Cream from 1966 - 1968 and in 2005 he proves he still has the chops!  No 2nd or 3rd guitarist, piano and keys to flesh out the sound, just bass, drums and Claptons guitar.  Easily the best Clapton related release in many many years!  The rest is just gravy, Jack Bruce, I mean come on...Everyone from Lemmy to Les Claypool idolize this guy, and he he still terrific after all these years. Ginger, rocks first powerhouse drummer, what a great solo during Toad, very defined.    If you close your eyes you'd think these guys have been playing together for the last 35 years.  Amazing stuff!  Great DVD to watch.
B00004YKUY|4.0|O.K. people, so Steve Augeri has a similar vocal range as Steve Perry -- who the heck cares? As long as Journey keeps writing great, melodic rock, I will remain a fan. The other members obviously wanted his range to be able to perform the old classics live. You don't hire a tenor vocalist to be able to sing soprano tunes, or vice-versa. Come on, Journey has moved on musically and I think they will always be one of the most musically talented groups. Oh yeah, I doubt that Steve A. stays in a seperate hotel or rides in a seperate limo like his predecessor did while on tour. Yeah, Steve Perry had a terrific voice, but he also had the ego to match it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I must admit that as much as I absolutely adore Star Wars, I'm not a huge fan of Science Fiction (hides from all of the Trekkies in her family.) The beauty of Firefly is that Science Fiction is merely the backdrop for character driven scripts. While there are things that might concern parents of young children (some nudity, brief sex scenes and mild language,) this show is engaging and interesting to all types and ages of viewers. The characters all have many layers and throughout the four discs the audience really gets to know them and relate to them.  <br /> <br />I can see why Firefly was cancelled. It's one of those rare shows that crosses boundaries. It is undefinable in genre. It gets plopped into Sci-Fi, but it is so much more than that. It's a western, a drama, a situation comedy, a political commentary, a thriller/action... Perhaps Fox did not have the wherewithal to market this brilliant series to all of its potential viewers. I know I hadn't heard of it until after it was out on DVD and someone told me to rent it. Perhaps Fox was afraid of what the writers had to say in their scripts and how they went about saying it. For a show about thieves, there are a lot of moral tales.  <br /> <br />The series follows a Han Solo-esque Captain on his many adventures and show how a band of misfits joins up with him. It combine intricate morality issues with sex, violence and larceny, and does it all in such a way that your kids could wath it without much ado. The writing is brilliant and the actors are amazing. One is hard pressed to see that they are filming on a TV budget as the sets and costumes and cinematography are all top notch. <br /> <br />As for the DVD's themselves, I'm a big fan of commentaries and several of the episodes have commentary tracks included. Hearing from a variety of cast and production crew is amazing and you really hear the love in their voices for this project. My only complaint is the navigation of the menu's is a bit difficult to manage on a PC. I alos wish there were more easter eggs as this is the sort of genre where you'd expect them. <br /> <br />In a sense, I'm glad the show was cancelled. We now have a movie to watch and this is really a story for the big screen. Like the original Star Trek, I think Firefly's niche is about to be discovered in a series of feature length films... and why not? Another complaint I have about each episode is that they're over with far too quickly. When it comes to the crew of Serenity, I'm greedy and always want more.
B00003CWTI|3.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />This is a review I did a while back. While I still don't find it as great as people say, I do think it desearves more than 2 stars. In retrospect I should've given it 3 stars, that's as high as I'm willing to go with this. Since the review has already been published I can't change the star rating.<br /><br />As I've said before, Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most overrated fillmmakers. The only movie of his I liked was Boogie Nights (although I have not yet seen Hard Eight but have heard good things). He seems to get high praise because his films are bizarre and hard to follow. It seems that if a person doesn't understands a film thery think it must be over their heads. I gave this 2 stars because of what it could have been. This could have made 2 really good 90 min films, it could've even made 4 good 30 min short films; instead, it's a 3hr overdrawn depression filled movie. On the plus, it has a really great soundtrack. It seems PT Anderson can't make anything really happy or have any hope. The only really good performances were from John C. Reily, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Tom Cruise. The scene where the actors sing along was pretty cool and the direction was very energetic. But, most of these characters are just so self centered you can't feel sorry for them. And once again Anderson puts in a scene that makes no sense (a plague of frogs, and I'm not joking) and somehow people think it's prolific. Still, this isn't as gut-wrenchingly horrible as his next film Punch-Drunk Love, but it's not nearly as good as Boogie Nights.I will say that my favorite scene was the begining about coincedences.
0201633612|5.0|The book that changed the software world in 1995 and still the definitive book even though its in its first edition 10 years later.  It authors have the nickname \\"The Gang Of Four\\" because it is so seminal that just referencing the four authors defines the book and its impact.<br /><br />The idea behind this book is simple, almost all programming projects are based a few basic designs with modifications for particular aspect of the project. This book describes those basic designs as a set of pre-defined patterns (named) and identifies how you can extend those patterns to the projects specific needs in a neat orderly manner.<br /><br />This is not the book to read if you are new to Object Oriented Programming, but if you understand the principles of OOP and OOA then this is a great place to jump in at the deep end.<br /><br />If you are programming in n.NET of J2EE and doing any serious programming this books describes well how to leverage patterns to these environments. You will start to understand why these program frameworks have been created and how to leverage them.<br /><br />If you find this book to daunting try the O'Reilly book \\"Head First Design Patterns\\", it's quirky and fun and much more accessible.
1932100385|5.0|Finally, the definitive book on the best nutrition for our bodies!  The author, T. Colin Campbell, has impeccable credentials and I trust what he has to say.  He writes clearly and concisely so that I can understand complicated scientific research and what the scientific studies mean for me.  Until I read this book, I was very confused about what foods my body needed for optimal health.  He explains in layman terms how we utilize the foods we consume, why certain food groups are excellent fuel, and why others should be avoided.  This is basic nutrition and if you think about it and add up what you already know and probably suspected, you will know the author is right.  I was so excited to read this book, that I want everybody I know to read it a.s.a.p. which is why I am buying more copies to give to my friends and family.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00009YXHN|4.0|A little time has passed and Miskatonic University has returned to a semblance of normalcy.  Somehow or other Doctors Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) and Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) are back practicing medicine and mayhem in the halls of the college hospital.  Megan Halsey, Cain's love from the first re-animator file lies dying and Cain is desperate to save her life - in a normal fashion.  West, of course, has no such compunctions.  He's down in their basement lab working on a whole new approach for gluing bits together (if you watch carefully, this film is rife with Frankenstein references).<br /><br />The initial phases of the film are predictable, and every bit as hokey as the first, classic film.  West scavenges parts where he may and glues them together in strange combinations.  Lt. Chapham (Claude Jones) stalks the two medicos, determined to expose them for the fiends that drove his wife insane.  And Dr. Graves (Mel Stewart) the coroner manages to revitalize Dr. Carl Hill's (David Gale) head and fix it up so that it can fly like a bat.  In the midst of all this madness, Francesca Danelli (Fabiana Udenio) struts about being beautiful and partially undressed.  Just like old times.<br /><br />But suddenly the film takes a deeper turn during the frantic final sequences.  Megan's head is used to complete Dr. Hill's eerie bride, and all the comedy replays the same serious questions that Mary Shelley's story raised a long time before.  Is challenging the divine power of creation within man's capacity?  What does the creator owe to one brought into existence.  West refers to his creations as useless bits of tissue, but it is clear that they are not.  The mixture of ethics and frantic humor is surprisingly engaging, and this film is almost as good as Re-animator.  Take a look if you're in the mood for something strange.
B0000931QA|5.0|I agree with Mr D. \\"Artist/Designer/Kibitzer\\", except,.. Mindcrime is not Queensryche's second album, it is their third!! The Warning was their first full album (the self titled EP doesn't count) and Rage For Order was their second album. As a fan since I saw the video for Queen of the Reich on HBO, before the EP was available in my area, I was blown away by how much they grew and how intelligent their music became. I saw them open for Metallica on the Injustice For All tour and Queensryche blew Metellica away! While Queensryche is not for just anyone,.. EVERYONE should give this album a listen... you may just like it!
B000001GQP|5.0|After spending about a year in places where there isn't a single performance of Carmina Burana to be found (yes, there are still some left here on Earth) I decided that this indeed was an opportune time to find the one ultimate performance of the piece that fits me best. I was coming into selection process completely fresh, remembering from my previous Levine version nothing but the fact that way back then I really liked it. So I took 12 versions of Carmina Burana, and started comparing them side by side, in three stages, being aware that the first one I'd listen to would have a better chance to influence my judgment. Among versions I had in front of me were Muti's, my old Levine, Fruhbeck de Burgos's, two Jochum's, couple of lesser known ones from former Czechoslovakia, Shaw's, and three more that I just don't remember. I wish I also had Previn's since from skimming through reviews it appears to be of some significance but I didn't.  <br /> <br />After \\"the first round\\" I had three to chose from: Dutoit's, Dorati's and this - so called, the Jochum/Fischer-Dieskau one. After the second round I put Dutoit aside and was facing with what in my opinion amounted to a very difficult choice. On one hand I had Dorati: a more conventional performance but of incredible energy. The baritone in Estuans interius was right on the button. Soprano performed beautifully and tenor was good too. In \\"O Fortuna\\" Dorati kept Royal Philharmonic at \\"reckless abandon\\" and I felt as though I was back on the Death Road in a convertible but going at least 120km/hour. I called this Dorati's version, \\"the fast one\\".  <br /> <br />Then there was this, Jochum/Fischer-Dieskau's, and what I called \\"the spooky version\\" based on the tightly \\"horror-moviesque\\" whispering element in the work's famous beginning. The orchestra  sounded full here, nearly as one indistinguishable instrument. The tenor in Olim lacus colueram in my opinion was absolutely unmatched, baritone and soprano however performed almost daringly different from what I was used to in other versions. Initially I was taking aback, not being sure if I liked it. But after the third or the fourth time putting it against Dorati - it began growing on me.  <br /> <br />Of course, I'm going to keep both. Yet, if I was really forced to make a choice here - I'm pretty sure I'd go with Jochum/Fischer-Dieskau.  <br /> <br /> <br />PS. For the other two parts of Trionfi I had two to choose from:  <br />the old Jochum's and the more recent with Welser-Most. To my surprise, after playing them side by side, I prefered the later.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|The Eagles are the quintessential polished group who don't mind letting us know that they are better now than ever before.  That's probably true, because as they also reveal, in concert they rarely stray from their tried and true hits, polishing them even more. The Eagles know their fans' preferences. <br />Except for a few new items, fans get exactly what they come to see and hear when they attend an Eagles concert:  lucious and flawless music and never-wavering vocals that are predictable and safe.  <br />But one can't escape the reality that the Eagles ARE so together, weaving a concert tapestry that never drops a stitch.  This double DVD set will not disappoint because it enforces the indelible stamp that the Eagles have left throughout their long and glorious career.  If you're looking for daring innovations and experimentations, you won't find much here.  But if you have two-plus hours to enjoy the greatest gamut of rocking, memorable music, curl up with a loved one and let 'er rip!

He and Dean Koontz really know what pushes our fright buttons. <br /> <br />A natural for the movie, and Jack Nicholson was wonderful in that part.  What a team: KING AND NICHOLSON.

B0009UC7H0|1.0|Unfortunately, I concur that this movie is a formulaic boar. (Just trying to keep in the spirit of illiteracy).  Although all the others needed this \\"career boost\\"(?), William H. Macy ought to be ashamed of himself.  (Positively brilliant in \\"Boogie Nights\\".)  \\"National Treasure\\" and this are two of kind:  thin, cynical rip-offs with actors (McConaughey and Gage) needing to restart their fizzled careers.   Both are just the right type of cardboard to fit the Q-survey parameters.

I got it and I thought that I was only going to like those three songs but I like them all.  I don't have to skip over one song Gerard Ways voice is full of so much emotion.  My favorite songs on the cd are helena, to the end, you know what they do to guys to us in prison, im'i not ok I promise, the ghost of you, the jet set life is gonna kill you, thank you for the venom, hang em high, cemetery drive, and I never told you what I do for a living.  Those are the best songs on the cd.  It is one of the best cds of I have bought.  if you like any of the singles you will like the cd.  it is really good!!!!  Hope this helps someone.
B00003CXCT|1.0|George Lucas and 20th Century Fox are at it again...this time it's a limited affair with the Star Wars Trilogy: Limited Edition debuting December 6th. These DVD boxed sets will be the \\"special editions\\" presented in both Full and Widescreen.      The only difference between these new releases and the previous 2004 DVD release seems to be the DVD cover art; (also the 4th bonus disc will NOT be included).    Will Lucas and Fox succeed in yet another shrewd delve into the consumer pocket?  Only you can make that decision come this December.    The 1 star rating goes to what appears to be another greed scheme concocted by Lucas and 20th Century Fox...there is absolutely nothing wrong with the current set now available (unless you're an Original Trilogy purist, and there's nothing wrong with that).    Star Wars itself will always receive high marks from me, but its creator and distributor are leaving consumers with a bitter taste; it may seem like \\"smart business\\" to continue milking the life out of a great product...but sooner or later the cow has to get tired.
B00005V9HH|5.0|To focus this review I am concentrating on the DVD itself.  So, unlike a crispy Hungarian, I don't want to scream out the name Keyser Soze, and I won't draw you a picture.  Clearly, this truly is a great story of 5 crooks working together to unravel a mystery, and just stay out of jail.  Or the other way 'round. . .  As for the DVD -- it is now selling for a lower price and is well worth it.  I got it at half the list price at military exchange deployed.  This version of the DVD (single disc) has the film in both wide screen and full screen on side A, and special features on side B.  The quality is fine, sound good and picture too.  I played it on my laptop -- haven't yet tried it on the cheap DVD player I have at home.  Special Features include three featurettes, trailers (theaterical and int'l) and TV spots.  There's 6 deleted scenes, with commentary before each.  Overall great value and a treasured addition to the gangster section of my collection.  I wasn't disappointed with this DVD (special edition version), and you won't be either.  You'll love the story, the acting (OUTSTANDING) and the DVD -- although not packed with features, it is a solid value.<br /><br />As for the story itself -- always check the details.  Keep your rewind button ready.  And be prepared -- I read that Kevin Spacey and the director signed a deal for a sequel.  Not sure when it would release, I guess no earlier than next summer.  Mr. Soze may indeed have a few more stories to tell, or keep secret . . .
B00003CXCT|5.0|I do recomend this DVD Saga is a whole lot more in detail than the other one I mean the making of and everything explained a lot of stuff that I did not understand the fist time I saw the saga... Great buy if you ask me.
B000002VSN|5.0|I don't mean to be any disrespect to the likes of Shirley Ceasar and Albertina Walker, but anyone who is a Whitney Houston fan, knows that she was meant to make an album like tthis. This is one of the best albums of the Gospel genre and the R&B world. Whitney really went back to her roots on this album and no matter what she is going through at this present day and time, she is still one of the greatest singers to ever grace this earth. She has crossed over into that treasure where people love her and want to see her doing well. Finally I would just like to say to everyone, especially African-Americans and true Whitney fans, lets nurse Whitney back to good spirits and success so that she can show Mariah Carey and Toni Braxton how its really done. WE ARE DOING NOTHING BUT MAKING IT WORSE BY MAKING FUN AND BRINGING HER DOWN. WE LOVE U WHITNEY! THANX FOR YOUR WORK!

0712661158|5.0|I first read M. Scott Peck's 'The Road Less Travelled' over 20 years ago, but it is a text to which I return again and again, as Peck's insights and observations remain a constant source of inspiration and guidance in my life. It still finds a ready home in the hands of therapists, counselors, ministers, teachers, career planners, and others as part of their resources, and is not out of place in the home of anyone who cares about the directions of her or his life.<br /><br />Peck was a clinical psychiatrist - the material for this book came largely from his experiences with clients and others, seeing what worked and what didn't, what was missing and what was mis-understood. Often cases involved psychotherapy (talk therapy), but the processes here are not confined to therapists' offices. The same kinds of problem solving, processing and relationship building that takes place in psychotherapy can be used as life-long tools.<br /><br />Peck resists labels such as Freudian and Jungian; he doesn't look for, nor does he offer, quick fixes or the psychotherapeutic variety of the get-rich-quick schemes. This book is not a therapy manual, but rather a guide to spiritual growth that incorporates therapeutic and psychological principles. Peck echoes the sentiments of many spiritual directors and leaders through the millennia that spiritual and personal growth are long journeys, not short leaps. It involves dedication and intention, and a willingness to accept risk and change.<br /><br />Perhaps it is ironic that, given this, the first topic Peck focuses upon is Discipline. However, without discipline, change can go unchecked and uncharted, growth can become problematic, and the human soul becomes susceptible to a host of difficulties. Dedication and application to problem-solving and long-term building (whether it be of retirement funds or of one's own spirit) requires a disciplined approach that recognises that life is difficulty (the first of Buddha's Four Noble Truths, cited by Peck), gratification sometimes needs to be delayed for greater goods, and reality needs to be approached and dealt with responsibly.<br /><br />Peck calls here for a life to be totally dedicated to the truth. This is hard, because we as human beings are so accustomed to rationalisation and reinterpretation. This kind of dedication also requires a balance in life, and an ability to be flexible as the truths of our lives change - few of us are in possession of timeless and eternal truths governing every aspect of our lives, and often those who feel they are end up disappointed in the end. The continuing creativity of God in our lives requires flexibility, but this is best achieved in a disciplined and balanced context.<br /><br />Peck then turns to love, a mysterious thing even in the best of times. He identifies some of the myths of `falling in love' and romantic love that our culture through various means idealises, leading to great dissatisfaction when we do not achieve the desired feelings or situations. Peck makes the assertion that love is not really a feeling, but rather an action or activity, that involves a lot of risk-taking (Peck talks about risks of independence, of commitment, of confrontation, and of loss). True love requires discipline and recognition of the needs of the self and others.<br /><br />The final two sections of the text deal with aspects of religion on the spiritual and psychological development of persons. The first section looks at religion and growth processes. He does a short survey of some attitudes toward religions and denominations, as well as a look at how the modern scientific mindset colours the worldview of modern people, particularly with ideas of verification and skepticism. Some psychologists and theorists have wondered if religion were mass delusions, mass psychosis, or some other kind of sickness. Peck uses interesting extended case studies here to examine the role of various aspects of religion in the developmental lives of several people. Peck asks the question, `Is belief in God a psychopathology?' In some aspects, and for some people, the way they approach and `use' religion, the answer may well be yes. However, Peck also takes the psychotherapeutic community to task for often being too narrow or too dismissive of the value of religious sentiment and institutions in the lives of their charges.<br /><br />The final section looks at the role of grace in the spiritual growth process. Grace is another mysterious force, like love, that is difficult to pin down and explain. It is also something uncontrollable. Why do some with artistic talent end up being successful and celebrated, and others not? Why do some use their talent, when others don't? In cases of ultimate despair, Peck makes the observation that while it is often clear why some people commit suicide, it is not often clear why others in the same situations don't. Some of this has to do with the unconscious mind that guides us, and some of it has to do with the miracle of serendipity, as Peck describes it.<br /><br />Peck describes in some detail his concept of what grace is and how it works, in very general terms that relate to no denomination or religion in particular, but has wide applicability.

B000002U9W|5.0|I completly agree with the person that said artist are to hard on themselves. I dont remember ever seeing any of this material on any \\"greatest hits\\" record, or any live album for that matter. word is that pink wasnt really that enthused about the material on this album. <br /> <br />I was skeptical about getting this album to be honest. But the 25 minute set of atom heart mother is worth the cash alone. but there are some really buetifull songs on this record to. besides the title track fat old sun and summer of 68 are my favs on the record. If is ok, but doesnt reaslly stand out. I really dig alens phycodelic breakfest, just not one you could really sit down and listen to with friends. <br /> <br />in conclussion I highly recomend this record this album....plus it is only like 10 bucks at wal mart or fred myer so it is practicly a steal.
0099727404|5.0|I first read M. Scott Peck's 'The Road Less Travelled' over 20 years ago, but it is a text to which I return again and again, as Peck's insights and observations remain a constant source of inspiration and guidance in my life. It still finds a ready home in the hands of therapists, counselors, ministers, teachers, career planners, and others as part of their resources, and is not out of place in the home of anyone who cares about the directions of her or his life.<br /><br />Peck was a clinical psychiatrist - the material for this book came largely from his experiences with clients and others, seeing what worked and what didn't, what was missing and what was mis-understood. Often cases involved psychotherapy (talk therapy), but the processes here are not confined to therapists' offices. The same kinds of problem solving, processing and relationship building that takes place in psychotherapy can be used as life-long tools.<br /><br />Peck resists labels such as Freudian and Jungian; he doesn't look for, nor does he offer, quick fixes or the psychotherapeutic variety of the get-rich-quick schemes. This book is not a therapy manual, but rather a guide to spiritual growth that incorporates therapeutic and psychological principles. Peck echoes the sentiments of many spiritual directors and leaders through the millennia that spiritual and personal growth are long journeys, not short leaps. It involves dedication and intention, and a willingness to accept risk and change.<br /><br />Perhaps it is ironic that, given this, the first topic Peck focuses upon is Discipline. However, without discipline, change can go unchecked and uncharted, growth can become problematic, and the human soul becomes susceptible to a host of difficulties. Dedication and application to problem-solving and long-term building (whether it be of retirement funds or of one's own spirit) requires a disciplined approach that recognises that life is difficulty (the first of Buddha's Four Noble Truths, cited by Peck), gratification sometimes needs to be delayed for greater goods, and reality needs to be approached and dealt with responsibly.<br /><br />Peck calls here for a life to be totally dedicated to the truth. This is hard, because we as human beings are so accustomed to rationalisation and reinterpretation. This kind of dedication also requires a balance in life, and an ability to be flexible as the truths of our lives change - few of us are in possession of timeless and eternal truths governing every aspect of our lives, and often those who feel they are end up disappointed in the end. The continuing creativity of God in our lives requires flexibility, but this is best achieved in a disciplined and balanced context.<br /><br />Peck then turns to love, a mysterious thing even in the best of times. He identifies some of the myths of `falling in love' and romantic love that our culture through various means idealises, leading to great dissatisfaction when we do not achieve the desired feelings or situations. Peck makes the assertion that love is not really a feeling, but rather an action or activity, that involves a lot of risk-taking (Peck talks about risks of independence, of commitment, of confrontation, and of loss). True love requires discipline and recognition of the needs of the self and others.<br /><br />The final two sections of the text deal with aspects of religion on the spiritual and psychological development of persons. The first section looks at religion and growth processes. He does a short survey of some attitudes toward religions and denominations, as well as a look at how the modern scientific mindset colours the worldview of modern people, particularly with ideas of verification and skepticism. Some psychologists and theorists have wondered if religion were mass delusions, mass psychosis, or some other kind of sickness. Peck uses interesting extended case studies here to examine the role of various aspects of religion in the developmental lives of several people. Peck asks the question, `Is belief in God a psychopathology?' In some aspects, and for some people, the way they approach and `use' religion, the answer may well be yes. However, Peck also takes the psychotherapeutic community to task for often being too narrow or too dismissive of the value of religious sentiment and institutions in the lives of their charges.<br /><br />The final section looks at the role of grace in the spiritual growth process. Grace is another mysterious force, like love, that is difficult to pin down and explain. It is also something uncontrollable.

B000AY807Q|4.0|Just finished listening to the CD my standouts are..It's a Dream, Far From Home. Check out the chord structure on This Old Guitar borrowed from Harvest Moon. As a previous reviewer stated it's just slightly better than Greendale, but not much.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Everyone and their mother knows Beck for his ability to adapt to virtually any musical environment. He can tackle most genres - from rap to rock; from country to funk - and accomplish a result that is both masterful and enjoyable. While 'Sea Change' is in many ways a departure from Beck's typical genre-bending there are subtle qualities that make this as diverse as it is unified. The result is pure and utter beauty.<br /><br />This is an album that manages to find equal ground between self-pity and self-empowerment. An obvious consistent theme on this album ultimately makes this a concept album about lost love and the motions one must endure throughout the whole nasty process. While the theme is unified the mood remains unbalanced, mirroring what I assume is the kind of psychological impact that break-ups have on an individual. We begin with 'Golden Age', which can be interpreted as an immediate response to ending a relationship - that of optimism and hope. The guitar chords and xylephone make the song float like a classic Radiohead ballad reminiscent of 'No Surprises' off of OK Computer, yet the slide guitar adds a certain country quality that works extremely well. Bitterness and self-pity follow with 'Paper Tiger', 'Guess I'm Doing Fine' and 'Lonesome Tears', again beautifully composed and well-written pieces. 'Paper Tiger' has a trip-hop feel that reminds of Portishead with the ominous string section and ambient bass line, while 'Guess I'm Doing Fine' is a song similar in style to 'Golden Age' only more conventional in alterna-country form, as Beck wails over an arrangement that would make Willie Nelson proud. 'Lonesome Tears' again shows signs of trip hop influence, as Beck's gravel voice lulls over a beautiful string arrangement.<br /><br />Despite the melodrama that dominates this album there are trace elements of optimism with tracks like 'Lost Cause', in which Beck appears to have a weight lifted off of his chest as he finally admit the futility of his broken relationship. The song is as optimistic feeling as it is sounding, with a kind of happy-go-lucky guitar arrangement, soft percussions and ambient electro harmonies. The melodrama returns in 'End of the Day'; another country-tinged ballad that sees Beck sing beautifully over a more conventional country arrangement with floating steel guitar chords and acoustic slides.<br /><br />I can't get into detail about every song but you get the idea at how this album is put together. The album is one big long nasty break-up and because it's Beck it is being depicted in the most beautifully tragic way possible. The production is air tight, gorgeously laid out and compliments Beck's voice perfectly. Beck's voice is often overlooked but in this case it's not possible because he wails, whines and soothes with the kind of professionalism and passion that puts him right up there with the top vocalists in his category (if that even exists). With its crisp and competent approach to country-style rock ballads and trip hop arrangements, this is one of those albums where you can press play and not have to worry about skipping a single track. It's par for the course to think of Beck as a man of many diverse tastes and offerings; while the results, to some, are sometimes mixed, in this case you really can't go wrong. Beck's ability to create an ambient electro-alternative album by peppering it with country influences puts this album in the same category as classic country hybrids like the Rolling Stones' 'Exile On Main St.' and Van Morrison's 'Moondance'. Truly one of the best albums of the 21st Century.broken relationship.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie is very well done.   it is just as good or better than the book.    The two main characters played their parts extremely well.   And after all, what story could be better than 2 young lovers torn apart and finding each other again after almost 9 years.   I recommend reading the book to help enjoy the movie; and after i had done that i viewed the movie at least 1/2 dozen more times.  The scenes at the concert and the scene of her reading his letter were the most memorable to me.   A movie needing to be viewed more than once to catch  all the subtleties but so worth the viewing again and again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Of all the shows I've seen in recent memory, none is as truly imaginative or memorable as Firefly. I didn't get a chance to see the show when it first aired due to living outside of the U.S. at the time, but discovered it through the trailer for 'Serenity', which is the theatrical continuation of the story coming out now. I'm so glad I took a chance and bought the dvds. The characters, the storylines, the atmosphere, the unique world that unfolds before you on the screen leave you wanting more. It's intelligent, thought-provoking, at times hysterically funny, and has a large dose of good drama. So if you're into shows that draw you in, make you care about the characters and the world they inhabit, and engage you on many different levels, this is the show for you.
0778320448|3.0|The craft shop, A Good Yarn, in Seattle (based on Linda's Knit 'n' Stitch in Silverdale, Washington) advertised classes for beginner knitters.  Four women from unusual circumstances, all with health or interpersonal problems, become friends as they learn the age-old craft of knitting.  \\"Knit-one-pearl-two.\\" <br /> <br />Karen Alfke is quoted, \\"The yarn forms the stitches, the knitting forges the friendships, the craft links the generations.\\"  Evelyn crocheted a bed cover for me, though not perfect, I knew it was filled with her effort and love for her kid sister.  I returned the favor by cross-stitching an intricate design of ducks, a quote, and elaborate background for a gift to give to one of her daughters.  I did a dark brown silhouette cross-stitch of hunter, dog, and gun by a pond with the ducks flying over -- before my stroke which damaged my eyesight.  I coun't draw, but I could create beautiful cross-stitch designs -- no more! <br /> <br />\\"Knitting goes with us, it calms us.\\"Viki knitted a special \\"wrap\\" for her son and is always doing her crafts.

B000AXSN5G|4.0|This album has created a lot of confusion. Many have confused the Neil Young of this album (hereafter N.Y.) with the Neil Young of such albums as \\"Harvest,\\" \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" and \\"Sleeps with Angels.\\" That Neil Young hasn't made an album since 1997 (Broken Arrow). <br />This is a mistake that even Rolling Stone and Amazon.com has made, so don't feel too bad about it.  <br />This is a different N.Y., whose catalogue includes Silver and Gold (1999), Are You Passionate (2002), Greendale (2003), and now, the enigmatic Prairie Wind.  <br />Prairie Wind succeeds where his previous 3 albums have failed. It is a myriad of styles and lyrical tone which N.Y. has perfected over the previous 3 albums. This is not to say that this is simply a new coat of paint; rather it is N.Y. creating a new vehicle from old parts. He's stripped off all that bogged the other albums down, and thrown together an entirely new machine. <br />So rather than comparing this to the efforts of the similarly named Neil Young, take N.Y.'s new car for a ride...
078322947X|3.0|The much maligned Sorcerer is in fact a good well crafted thriller that if seen without refrence to the Original Wages of Fear would have faired far better at the hands of the critics. That's not to say the film is perfect. The opening scenes that fill the viewer in on the charecters back stories, are pointless and actually work against the tension that is built up later in the film. Knowing exactly why the characters are desperate makes their reasons for taking on the deadly task seem a bit lame and looses the exestential angst that creates such a hopeless atmosphere. <br /> <br />Once in South America the oppresive nature of their stay in the village is also diminshed by knowing too much about them. Having said all that there is still an air of desperation and mounting frustration, it's just not as clausterphobic as it could have been. Once the journey begins the tension is turned on, the only problem is that by knowing the original so well there is not quite the frisson of that classic. This is an unfortunate by-product of re-making any well respected film. Friedkin however has a fair go and if this is the film you see first you will wonder why it was so slated on original release. <br /> <br />The film moves at a well constructed pace that is aided by a cracking score from Tangerine Dream. The cast perform well and Roy Scheider is reasonably well cast but does not deliver the subtly nuanced performance he is capable of, for this you need to look towards (obviously) Jaws and to a lesser extent the minor role he playes in Naked Lunch. <br /> <br />All in all a good film, though not great, and as the review starts by saying, not Wages Of Fear, but it deserves a better reputation than it so unfortunatly has and will be a good addition to anyones collection of interesting 70's films (the best decade for American Filmaking by a long long way).

When his wife comes in and asks him to lock her in a closet.(strange lady). Then he goes and makes fun of a cops ears and gets busted. Ends up in a jail in the middle of nowhere and then gets raped by bisexual guards. Then he has to make a football team or the warden will read his mail. His team is messed up first of all. A crazy giant who screams and plays pingpong by himself. The qb that eats popcorn all the time so his hands are oily. A huge black guy with an iq of 1. And the buff guy who hides large objects in his pants, so he can feel tough. Oh and this caretaker guy who likes to hide shoes in cake. Long-stories short this is a rent in my book.

B000268QB2|3.0|As a whole, the songs on this album are a bit downtrodden and the lyrics tend to be a bit whiny.  Some of their keyboard solos are weird, and I can't stand the \\"X-files organ\\" they constantly use throughout many of their songs, mostly on their worse songs.  But lead singer Tom Chaplin's vocals are great and songs like \\"Bend and Break\\" and \\"Everybody's Changing\\" are examples of great songwriting.  These are probably the two most energetic songs on this album, which just demonstrates where Keane does best and shows their promise.  Keane has pledged that their next album will be more upbeat, and with the talent that Keane shows on this album that can only be a good thing.  Their biggest weakness is the negativity and sorrow in their lyrics, maybe as a result of losing their guitarist and inability for so long to get a good record contract?  But now that they are clearly successful and the reasons to whine are gone, I look forward to their next album.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Greed Day sucks and always will! They are a bunch of sell-outs and this album is their worst (all the others were bad also). But here GD are joining to the mainstream and making gay songs like boulevard of broken dreams. Green Day sux! <br /> <br />F**K GREEN DAY!!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Like Radiohead's \\"Kid A,\\" this one was a bit of a grower to me (although \\"Takk\\" took less time to warm up to).  \\"Kid A\\" was Radiohead's complete masterpiece, track-by-track, as a whole.  \\"Takk\\" is the same way.  You must listen to it (at least at first) as a whole unit, for all of the songs go together.  Even though I cannot understand Icelandic (or the lead singer's invented dialect, \\"Hopelandic\\" as I believe it's called) I feel like this album is a tale, a story being written and played out by all of the magnificent composition Sigur Ros has done.  Thinking of \\"Takk\\" in a more classical sense, it has marvelous mood changes within and between songs, and a sense of moving conflict toward resolution.  This album is an amazing work of art.
B000000HU1|5.0|Every now and then there comes along some music that convinces me that when artists collaborate with like-minded musicians, they can actively and intentionally channel, well, something, call it a Muse if you will: Gong's YOU is one of those albums. <br /> <br />When I listen to this album in the right frame of mind I swear that there are whole passages of music that don't appear on the album at other times--maybe that's the Invisible Opera. Maybe that's why they call it \\"space music\\"--I dunno! <br /> <br />This album contains some of the finest instrumental work ever laid down: listen to Hillage channeling the Octave Doctors via his axe-work on the track \\"A Sprinkling of Clouds\\" and you'll know what I mean. Needless to say, this is truly a magic(k)al album that can permanently change consciousness. Thank you, Captain Capricorn et al!
B0006IIKS0|4.0|The movie is very well done and it shows a side to Metallica that you would never expect them to have, much less be allowed to see. Who knew the gods of metal were such whining pussies when no one was looking? That said, it did take some level of balls to allow the world to see them at their weakest, so there has to be some credit given there. Worth watching, as long as you have no illusions that you don't want shattered.
0380977788|5.0|It's a book I think both kids and adults would enjoy. The Sandman apart, it's kind of my favorite of Neil Gaiman's books so far. I found it strangely soothing to be caught in the web of this story rather than in the web of my own existence for a while. It helped me get through the stress of being on a long flight when I would normally not be able to focus on anything and it's precious for that reason. It's written is a delightfully gloomy style that I very much enjoyed.

The author with great humor takes the laments of many prominent people about how 'our great language is getting corrupted' and shows that exactly those forces of efficiency and elaboration along with others like analogy created the complicated structures we know.  The journey unfolds very easily, with some surprises along the way, and presents an enjoyable journey thru the development of several languages.

B000002OMN|5.0|1977's \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" became one of Rock's All-Time Classic Albums.   This album was for all practical purposes a Rock Opera (now referred to as  Wagnerian Rock).   The concept of \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" seemed to revolve around the thoughts of an a teenage/young adult male.    What really made \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" so special was the combination of Jim Steinman's songwriting,  Meat Loaf's powerful and passionate vocals, and the producing of Todd Rundgren.   Following \\"Bat Out of Hell\\", Meat's career would go into a tailspin.  Although Steinman would write the songs for Meat's follow-up album \\"Dead Ringer\\" - he had little to do with the rest of it.   Meat's career would bottom out in the mid 1980s.   By the late 1980s, Meat was beginning to revive his career by hitting the road and playing small venues.  As Meat would develop a large cult following, this would help lead to a reunion with Jim Steinman.   Once again, the two would collaborate on another concept album.   The new album that was released in 1993 was entitled \\"Bat Out of Hell: Back Into Hell\\".   The big question would remain - after 16 years could Meat and Steinman revive the magic of the first album?    Not only do they revive the magic, but they surpass it in everyway. <br /> <br />As mentioned above, the reason why \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" was such a great album was due to the triple combination of Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf, and Todd Rundgren.   This time Steinman assumes all creative control - including the production duties.   Todd Rundgren does return to provide many of the outstanding background vocals that are a key component to this album.   I don't look at Steinman's move to have creative control as a negative - he knew exactly what he was doing.   Steinman would have 16 years to build the vision for this album.   As a result, we get an album that is musically and lyrically more complex as well as more mature than the original \\"Bat Out of Hell\\".   At the same time, Meat hasn't lost a beat.   Steinman provides the infrastructure for Meat to deliver a more powerful set of vocals than he did the first time.  No doubt, Meat and Steinman work perfectly together.   <br /> <br />\\"Bat Out of Hell II\\" contains 11 tracks coming out to 75+ minutes of music!   Some criticized Meat and Steinman for the long tracks.  Seven of the 11 tracks clock in at over 6 minutes and 50 seconds.   The amazing thing is that on each track - you won't hear one bit of filler.    Like it's predecessor, \\"Bat Out of Hell II\\" takes on a theatrical feel of a Rock Opera.   Every track is so much more than a song - it's a performance.  You will hear the theatrical quality in almost every song.   Steinman employs a similar formula to the music - a strong mix of Keyboards and Guitar to compliment Meat's performance style vocals.  It is also worth noting that Roy Bittan (from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band) who was a major contributor on the original \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" contributes keyboard and piano to 6 tracks. <br /> <br />It is worth noting that Meat actually only sings vocals on 9 of the 11 tracks.   One track consists of spoken words (\\"Wasted Youth\\") by Steinman himself.   Another track is an instrumental (\\"Back Into Hell\\") done by Jeff Bova - who provides synthesizers on all of the tracks.  <br /> <br />Every track on this album holds its own.   The album opens with \\"I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)\\".   This was the first single released from the collection, but the radio edit heard on conventional radio does not do this song justice.   The album version is 12 minutes long - and there is not a split second you will be bored.  This song is a true all-around performance by everyone involved.  The original \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" had \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" and the great dialogue by Meat and Ellen Foley.   This time Meat has a more compassionate dialogue - this time with someone credited \\"Mrs Loud\\". <br /> <br />Another terrific performance is \\"Out of the Frying Pan (And Into the Fire)\\".  This is another song that spells true theatrical performance - with very passionate vocals by Meat, but the highlight is going to be the very familiar piano sound of Roy Bittan. <br /> <br />Perhaps the strongest song on the album is \\"Everything Louder Than Everything Else\\".   For this performance, everything is at the highest level.    This song is preceded by Steinman's \\"Wasted Youth\\" speech.  \\"Everything Louder\\" is the perfect segue from \\"Wasted Youth\\".   The speech which is given as a retrospective as someone who once had an undisciplined youth.  When \\"Everything Louder\\" begins, we hear as powerful a performance as you will hear from Meat.  \\"Everything Louder\\" is lyrically a very strong song as it deals with an undisciplined youth facing the choices of having to go to battle and fight for his country.   This is sheer brilliance.   Meat delivers Steinman's words passionately when he sings \\"Who am I? Why am I here?\\" (referring to being in the Service).   But perhaps the power of these lyrics is heard best in the lines \\"They say I'm in need of some radical discipline....They say that I'm wild and I'm reckless; I Should be Acting My Age\\". <br /> <br />You will hear the passion and power on every track on this album.   \\"It Just Won't Quit\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come True\\" are outstanding.   \\"Good Girls Go to Heaven\\" has a jazz-like beginning followed by a 50s near doo-wop style intro. Ellen Foley (from the first album) provides the background vocals on \\"Objects in the Rear View Mirror Appear Closer Than They Are\\". <br /> <br />The liner notes contain all the lyrics and musical credits.  I particularly like how one line from each song is highlighted on the page that contains the lyrics for that song.   Meat and Steinman prove they didn't lose a beat.    This album is a must have!
B0000C1733|5.0|I'm a German, oh yeah, but I hate the Nazis, as you can see in my Name, and oh yeah I love the Chili Peppers and their real cool sound! <br />Although I already got every (every!) CD of the band, I bought the greatest Hits CD and it was a real good decision! <br />This Album rocks! <br />The exploding mixture of Rock,Funk,Punk and some other styles is the best for everone to hear!  <br />Sayonara your favorite German Punk Rock guy, Antinaz!
B000AJJNPY|1.0|This review is, for the most part, applicable to any of this group's recordings, all of which I have revisited on several occasions. I have tried to comprehend why these guys have been anointed as the saviors of modern music. The only explanation I have at the moment is that an elitist group of rock critics have so decided. Sigur Ros themselves have expressed their distaste for conventional popular music and its rigidity of song structure. What do they offer as an alternative? To my ears, the results are ponderous pieces of modern pseudo orchestral music. The CD is virtually devoid of anything resembling a memorable melody. The numbers are not fully realized as they meander to the point of concert audiences applauding at inappropriate times. The singing is in an irritating falsetto. It sounds as if it's emanating from someone with vital parts of their anatomy trapped in a vise grip. And as to the language in which it's being sung; the group here use their native tongue Icelandic instead of their made-up language Hoplandic of earlier releases. More appropriate would have been a move to \\"Hype-landic\\". Trust your own ears and don't be influenced by the hype. Then you will realize that this reeks of pretentiousness and is severely lacking in musicality.
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|I definitely have this cd in heavy rotation. Hayley's voice is amazing. They are such an impressive band considering how young everyone is!! It is basically heavier pop-rock. It is different than what's out there right now. Her lyrics aren't exactly deep & profound,, but she is 16 so it's forgiveable. It's also another reason I love the record. She straightforward & makes a strong point in every song without sugarcoating everything with metaphors like many emo bands do. One thing I love about this band is they are even more impressive live. GO SEE THEM if you get the chance. One of the only problems I had with the record is the order of the tracks does not make much sense to me. They also seem to be experimenting alot, as some of the tracks are really good rock, some even with screaming, and some (mainly \\"Woah\\" & \\"Pressure\\") are straight, somewhat annoying pop. This is definitely a band to watch. It's an extremely solid first release.

0553565915|5.0|I had lost my mother within the year and was attending my grandfather's funeral when I started reading this book.  It really seemed to help me make sense of it all (life and death).  Some of the things seem very \\"far fetched\\", but I have seen Betty talk of her experience and she seemed like a very kind and loving person and I am sure she did see these things.  I have read her other books and it just gets better as she is able to explain even more in depth about her experience and the lessons she has learned from it all.  Read it with an open mind and it will help give a reason to why we are here and what's it all about.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Excellent!  Condition of package and CD's perfect. <br />Thank you.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Having read through the first six Harry Potter novels, I would definitely say that the first movie holds truest to the movie (granted, as time goes on the books go longer and something gets cut on the finishing room floor else we'd end up with six hour long movies).  Though the chemistry isn't all quite there yet, with Richard Harris as Dumbledore, how can this movie not rock?
B000002H97|4.0|I'll give this CD 4 stars because ENTER SANDMAN is one  of my all time favorite songs. I don't know I could like this  CD. But ENTER SANDMAN is the best!!!!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest and wittiest films I have seen in years though reading reviews I noticed that many people were complaining that it wasn't scary, it wasn't supposed to be, just because it had zombies in doesn't mean that is was going to be a horror movie. The point was to poke fun at zombie movies in a good natured way. I noticed that the Americans that wrote poor reviews also complained they couldn't understand the accents of the main characters, it's an English film that was only released in the U.S.A because of its success in Britain amd therefore was never meant to be seen by most americans so their lack of understanding English accents was never taken into account in the filming of the movie, much like the filming of many American films that British people have trouble understanding so stop complaining and enjoy a true cult classic.
B000000OQF|2.0|This album sucks!!! There are some very mean dirty sexy drug <br />songs on this this is just as bad as Back in Black from ACDC. <br />The only good songs on this would be the 3 big hits featuring <br />WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, PARADISE CITY, & SWEET CHILD O' MINE. <br />There are only 3 good obscure GNR songs such as IT'S SO EASY, <br />MR. BROWNSTONE, & 14 YEARS from Use Your Illusion 2. Don't <br />buy this, buy GNr Greatest Hits insted.
B00008PX8P|5.0|No word could easily describe the value of this dvd set; everything, from musical quality down to the package is the epitome of luxury. Equally awesome is the description of the tremendous amount of work needed to produce this jewel. As far as music goes, well is tons and tons of adrenaline, a wall of music for which terrific is the only word I can muster. I find \\"Stairway to heaven\\" alone worth the buy. And the rest is just as wonderful.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is my favorite Dire Straits album. I ordered 4 copies of <br />this and Making Movies better together. Every song is 5 stars, <br />here's how the songs are on this amazing CD. <br /> <br />1. Telegraph Road - My favorite song. Great ending, very long <br />though.  <br /> <br />2. Private Investigations - Great, the ending great. <br /> <br />3. Industrial Disease - My favorite song. Very great song, repeat <br /> <br />4. Love Over Gold - Good song, every step great. <br /> <br />5. It Never Rains - Great great great, my favorite song. <br />Worth of heavy metal great.  <br /> <br />This is the best.
B000056NX5|1.0|I was so excited when I heard of the revival, but then I had the misfortune of watching this. My issues center around two major problems. First is that Carter simply does not have the proper voice range to hit the high notes. Second is that the portrayal of Judas is very traditional and conservative. The original concept was one which presented the life of Christ through the eyes of Judas. The audience should identify with Judas and not hate him. In this version Judas is the typical evangelical version that you expect to see at a Christmas or Easter play.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I'll give this CD 1 star because Boulevard of Broken Dreams is <br />a good song. Other than that I've heard Holiday and it is what <br />makes Green Day suck! Here's what to get.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|Burton is a genius. <br /> <br /> <br />with that out of the way, i will say that i am EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEMYLY  excited to gfinally get the SE dvd's of the first 2 batman movies. screw schumacher and his 2 neon filled films, burton got it right and made some damn good batman films with interesting characters and stories that made you feel and think, and schumacher didnt. he REALLY didnt. end of story. so thats why i am only purchasing the first 2 Burton films, cuz when you compare schuamcher films to burton films...well.......do i really have to say anything? anyways, i was dissapointed for a long time with the original stupid empty shams of dvd's for BATMAN and Batman Returns, and im glad i decided not to buy them. my patience has finally been rewarded. Batman is my fav. superhero, hes real, human, and just plain cool.i saw Batman Begins, and while it was a good film, i still like burtons vision and films better. i just connect with it more, and the fact i grew up with these films, and that they are STILL my favorites and has the best action and characters ans stories, and a hell of alot more interesting and action packed then Batman Begins was, im just grateful for burton creating such vivid images and grandious sets and visuals and stories. thank you mr. Burton, God bless you.
B000002MJR|5.0|Great live recording from Dire Straits. Where the hell is BUG <br />or SOLID ROCK. Those are from the DVD and those were great. <br />Anyway, the rest of the CD is great. Here's how the songs are. <br /> <br />1. Calling Elvis - Great!!!!! <br /> <br />2. Walk of Life - One of my favorites. Rocks way better than studio. <br /> <br />3. Heavy Fuel - My favorite song!! Very great song, repeat. <br /> <br />4. Romeo and Juliet - The greatest song!! My favorite. Repeat. <br /> <br />5. Private Investigations - Great. Really heavier than studio. <br /> <br />6. Your Latest Trick - Newer than studio. Still gets boring. <br /> <br />7. On Every Street - Studio is slightly best. <br /> <br />8. YOu and YOur Friend - The studio is slightly the best. <br /> <br />9. Money for Nothing - Great, another big hit though the studio <br />is the best. <br /> <br />10. Brothers in Arms - Sad song though this version is the best. <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a great Sci-Fi show, what else can I say.  In a time when Star Trek was getting too caught up in trying to stick to thinly stretched and P.C. ridden world it was good to see something fresh and new.  Firefly was a truly original series and Fox made a big mistake in pulling it off of the air.  For a while I was hopeful that maybe the Sci-Fi channel might pick up the rights and start to make new episodes but I guess the movie that is coming out will have to suffice.  I highly recommend the DVD's for anyone that enjoys good science fiction.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite CD behind Love Over Gold and Making <br />Movies. It features the big hits such as CALLING ELVIS, ON <br />EVERY STREET, BUG, & HEAVY FUEL. There are other favorites on <br />this. I will not review all the songs since I don't like every <br />single song on. But HEAVY FUEL is probably my favorite song, <br />and is one of the hit songs from Dire Straits. If you loved <br />Making Movies, then get this CD because they are better together. <br />
B00004S6GL|5.0|I picked up this record on the recommendation of a friend from Portland, OR. He had been listening to Elliott Smith for years. The entire album is brilliant. Since purchasing this album I have collected all of his other albums. His music sounds like modern day John Lennon. I feel like we have been cheated out of so many more years of great music with his passing.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|Great CD for the MTV song, MONEY FOR NOTHING which is the number 1 Dire Straits song yet. Unfortunely this CD is rather weeek than <br />other Dire Straits CD. Here's how the songs are on this CD. <br /> <br />1. So Far Away - Great!!! One of my favorites. <br /> <br />2. Money for Nothing - My favorite song!! The best. <br /> <br />3. Walk of Life - Good a little overrated though a live version <br />is slightly better. <br /> <br />4. Your Latest Trick - Not bad. The live version is slightly <br />newer since this version is so old. <br /> <br />5. Why Worry - Kinda weak but the guitar is great. <br /> <br />6. Ride Across the River - Not the best <br /> <br />7. The Man's Too Strong - OK, but not great <br /> <br />8. One World - This is an amazing song. Great rock. <br /> <br />9. Brothers in Arms - Kinda great guitar song for sure though <br />it is kinda sad. <br /> <br />Anyway, I love Making Movies and other Dire Straits albums <br />this CD is not the best though. <br /> <br />I hope you found this review helpful, you probably may <br />not. <br /> <br />
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This album features a combination of interesting songs, strong and heartfelt singing, and clever and sympathetic arrangements and musicianship. This album seems to get better with each playing.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|This one starts out a little slow and slowly starts to pick up speed until the action continues on for the rest of the movie.  In the vain of the Indiana Jones features this movie has lots of bad guys, lots of heros/heroiens and pretty good high speed chase sequences.  There is humor, sadness and likeable characters all around.  The PG-13 rating seemed a bit low for this one (in my opinion) but none the less you will enjoy watching this one with the teens and pop-corn on the side.  Good Saturday night fare.
B000002H2H|4.0|Great album, a classic, but for me it's one of those albums trapped in time. When I listen to it now it sounds the most dated of their catalog. A little too heavy on the standard metal framework of the day with classical like guitar parts and such. Plus I don't like James Hetfield's voice on this album. It has a really high pitch to it for some reason which takes away from the heaviness of the tunes. I think they should go back and re-master this and And Justice For All,
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|Much better than you can imagine. 5 star by far. Una joya!!!
0140187537|5.0|The Winter of Our Discontent is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Had it not been for Steinbeck's already intimidating library of classics, this novel would have definitely gone down as one of the most important of the 20th century.<br /><br />The wit of part one is nothing short of amazing. I actually found myself laughing uncontrollably a few times, which is an extremely rare occurrence when it comes to good literature.<br /><br />Ethan is both one of the easiest to love and easiest to hate characters at different parts of the story that I've ever come across. The transition from honest working man to greedy businessman is done perfectly. His final confrontation with Mr. Baker was one of the most exciting climaxes in recent memory.<br /><br />The entire ensemble of characters alone would make this an instant classic. Steinbeck then goes as far as to create dozens of themes and potential discussions, all the while effectively making sure the plot was not forgotten.<br /><br />I can see how some would see it as boring at times. Part two goes much faster than part one, which is probably due to the plethora of off-topic discourses in the first part and the equal amount of dialogue in part two.<br /><br />I wouldn't suggest starting with this if you're trying to get into Steinbeck, but it shouldn't be the last title on your reading list. If it seems to drag on at times just stick with it. I will most definitely be reading this time and again.
B000056NX5|3.0|Awesome music on this new cast recording! But, what's going on with Andrew Lloyd Weber's Productions in DVD? Although he's a millionaire, he should put a little more effort in his productions. The play is RECORDED, not filmed, and it gives a bad quality for the great music.  Another thing that I don't like is Glenn Carter's performance. It's exagerated for a theatrical way of doing it, he uses a lot of body performance cliches, and it looks corny.  Anyway, Jerome Pradon as Judas is incredible!! I liked him a lot! almost as Carl Anderson's Performance in the 70's movie.  I didn't like the special features, though. I think they needed to be more specific as far as producion notes and interviews with the cast.  But I keep all the good critics to the 70's movie, because for me is still the best of all times.
B000A2H812|5.0|Gogol Bordello is a little bit different from your average Punk band. <br /> <br />Gogol Bordello's violins set them far apart from most three chord Punks. Er, and a singer who sounds like Ren Hoek, the world's most famous cartoon Chihuahua. And their love of Ukrainian Folk music. And the odd Reggae MC spot, complete with Jamaican rhythms. Um, and then there's the occasional Electronica/Dance influence. And the Spanish lyrics, which go quite well with the Ukrainian lyrics. <br /> <br />OK, so Gogol Bordello is pretty much a mucked up Gypsy/Punk mess. If you thought Refused were out there and pushing the boundaries of Punk, grab your binoculars and check again. Unfortunately, the best reference points for this band are similarly obscure as it is. The closest comparison would probably be the accordion-loving Korean Punk superstars Crying Nut, or Polish weirdy-Thrashers The Acid Drinkers, or even Finnish tractor-driving Teddy-Boy Rockers The Leningrad Cowboys. Unfortunately, hardly anyone has ever heard of them. If you want a near approximation of `Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike', you will need: an album of Ukrainian Folk music (try the library, but Romanian or Hungarian may suffice), a NOFX album (preferably scratched, so it skips and jumps), any episode of Ren and Stimpy (\\"Fire Dogs\\" should do just fine). Then, basically, play `em all at once. Stick the Folk music in your good stereo, NOFX on a tinny sounding portable radio, and Ren and Stimpy on the telly. Move around the lounge until you find a spot where all three are about the same volume and listen. <br /> <br />Generally, guitars carry most Punk bands. However, the violin is the lead instrument, ably supported by the accordion, and the guitar just fills the gaps. <br /> <br />\\"Sally\\" sounds like a manic carnival march, while vocalist Eugene Hutz raves about cultural revolution and flies. \\"I Would Never Wanna Be Young Again\\" is even more maniacal, punctuated by pscychitic screams. Third track \\"Not A Crime\\" repeats the phrase \\"In the old time/It was not a crime\\", and that's it. Who knows what the offence was! Musically, it's a traditional Gypsy song, also repeated over and over, with a hint of Reggae and Techno thrown in. While electric guitars are highly versatile, it's hard to beat the expressiveness, and in this case the sense of fun, a violin can convey. <br /> <br />All the craziness is tied together by a chaotic sense of melody and irresistible nonsensical lyrics, as addictive and logical as a nicotine and heroin sandwich. There is a bit of a message here, explaining how hard immigrants have it in the USA (\\"Immigrant Punk\\", \\"Underdog World Strike\\"), how bad it was back home (\\"Avenue B\\", \\"Think Locally, **** Globally\\"), and raging against the machine (\\"Sally\\", \\"60 Revolutions\\", \\"Oh No\\"). A lot of it though is just for fun. \\"Dogs Were Barking\\" is the weirdest wedding song ever written, sung half in Ukrainian. \\"Start Wearing Purple\\" and apparently all your sanity and wits will vanish and you'll start discussing philosophy. <br /> <br />Po-faced Straight-Edgers and crusty Anarcho-Punks need not bother with Gogol Bordello. It's too silly. Similarly, Good Charlotte/Green Day Punk pretenders will be thinking \\"what the...?\\" However, if Mr Bungle isn't eclectic enough for you, then perhaps you should consider joining the Gypsy Punk Party.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The music is original, varied, melodic, and symphonic.  The message is timely, accurate, brilliant, and passionate.  The writing is accessible and inspired. <br /> <br />I was lukewarm on Green Day before \\"American Idiot.\\"  I enjoyed their music, but didn't pay much attention to the band beyond their catchy tunes, and I certainly wouldn't have spent much time reviewing their albums. <br /> <br />No more.  Green Day has delivered a magnitude-10 sucker-punch to the apathetic American psyche, and this album deserves every adulation that it has received.  They are the voice of formerly apathetic youth suddenly awakened, tuned in, and turned on. <br /> <br />This is an album of destiny.  The song \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is the perfected evolution of a punk band that has become the informed conscience of American popular music.  Anybody with a rational mind and an ounce of conscience will find this masterpiece a moving, emotional experience of audio bliss. <br /> <br />BTW, if you get the chance to catch Green Day live in concert, get ready to rearrange your \\"Best Concert I've Ever Seen\\" list.  I've seen them twice this year and I'll go again if they're within 300 miles. <br /> <br />In short, Green Day, a band who's first hit was a song about spanking it, has become the most relevant and important band in the world.  Who knew!?  Five stars?  Nah...this album deserves its own star scale.  It exists on a different plane than any other album available on this site or in any store.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|First and Foremost.... Me being a Marley music fan for years...  I have to say that Jr.Gong has really stepped up, and his efforts will pay off i hope this year with another grammy award.  <br /> <br /> Of course the title track \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" is exellent... but,Jr. Gong has some more soon to be classic's on this album... like the \\"Road to Zion\\" featuring NAS...this is straight hip hop material. Pimpa's Paradise\\" a remake to \\"Pimper's Paradise\\" by his father Bob Marley,the strings, guitar are the result of great production by Stephen, With Damian on the vocals this song will leave you begging for more. \\"Move\\" Get's me pumped up being that he samples \\"Exodus\\" My favorite Bob Marley song.  <br />\\"Beautiful\\" is great... Even Bobby Brown is superb on the vocals. \\"The Master has come back\\" is in the club hip hop that show's Marley's love for hip hop and rap. \\"There for you\\" is so sweet... you see the softer side of Jr.Gong that you probably don't know he has.   \\"In 2 deep\\" Is superb... Straight Dancehall without gimmick....It's just damn good. Overall Get your copy and put this one in Reggae's Hall of Fame then stamp it \\" Classic\\" This is Damian's Finest work

B000002LCI|5.0|'music for the masses' (an incredibly funny and sarcastic album title) set the stage for what would be dm's magnum opus -- violator.  it's certainly less accessible than violator, but that's not to say it's unlistenable. quite the contrary actually.<br /><br />'music for masses' built on 'black celebration's' darker tones and added a bit more athemic sound (see 'never let me down,' 'strangelove' and 'behind the wheel' -- three of DM's greatest songs ever).  in many ways its the pefect segueway between 'black celebration and the brilliant 'violator.' in this way it does sometimes feel like a bridge album -- one leg in 'black celebration,' one leg in 'violator,' and consequently can sound a little confusing at times.  that being said, however, 'music for the masses' is still a brilliant album full of memorable tunes (and for me, full of wonderful memories). as i recently scrolled through the song titles, i was struck by the sheer number of quality songs.  up to 'music for the masses,' it seems most DM albums had a dud or two or three; yet 'music...' is replete with great songs including the highly underrated 'nothing.' what a great song.<br /><br />one of the most notable qualities is the albums production. 'black celebration' (still) sounds detached and cold, sometimes robotic and harsh (it may be the songs, however). 'music for the masses' is a much richer and more intricate album that its predecessors, an album that managed to sound warm and inviting depiste the often nihilistic, depraved and pervy subject matter.<br /><br />my only quibble (and it IS minor--so minor in fact i barely dare mention it) is the length of the album. i don't know tracks like 'agent orange,' and the two remixes don't necessarily *add* to album.  but that's a personal opinion more than anything.<br /><br />'music for the masses' may always play second fiddle to 'violator,' but even second fiddles can be stars of the show.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|This is a fast-paced, enjoyable movie. The characters are well done; the relationships genuine; and the plot just believable enough to be a little scary. Matthew M. is adorable, in a clutzy sort of way; he is surprisingly believable as an action-hero type guy. Make a big bowl of popcorn, grab a soda, and hold on. It's an Indiana Jones-like ride. <br /> <br />
0684833395|4.0|Joseph Heller's 1961 War novel has quietly moved into my top ten favorite book list because the more I read it the more I like it.  Heller was a navigator on a bomber in World War II and draws inspiration from his experiences  I am a self-proclaimed history buff, and I especially love war in American society.  But sometimes reading the same heroic war stories or glorifications of a great battle can become redundant.  Heller's satire is the proverbial breath of fresh air in comparison to the endless volumes of war related material. <br /> <br />    The story follows Yossarian, an aviator/bombadeer in World War II.  It becomes clear very quickly that Yossarian is about a nickel short of a dollar.  He imagines that everyone he knows or comes in contact with, save a few of his good friends, wants him dead.  The problem is with the system of flying bombing missions in the military.  When he began flying, an aviator was sent home after his 25th mission.  But as he continues to fly, his commander Colonel Cathcart increases the minimum number of missions an aviator must fly.  To escape his dangerous assignments, Yossarian fakes a liver disease and is sent to the base hospital.  It is here that he is first introduced to \\"Catch-22.\\" <br /> <br />     Yossarian and Doc Daneeka, the medical officer, are good friends.  So Yossarian asks Doc to lie on his medical exam and report that he is not mentally fit to fly.  Doc explains to Yossarian that because Yossarian asks him to do this, he is in essence proving his sanity.  He goes on to explain that anyone that would fly a plane into enemy territory is surely not mentally stable enough to fly a plane into enemy territory. (Read that sentence again if you don't get it the first time.)  But anyone who asks to be examined proves that he is sane enough to perform the same task. Catch-22 is basically a lose-lose situation. <br /> <br />     The part of the novel I found most interesting is only discussed a few times.  The characterof the soldier in white appears in the hospital at the beginning of the novel.  None of the men in the hospital know his name, and no one knows why he is there or where he is from.  The soldier in white symbolizes the anonymity of the men that fight for America.  Men gave their lives every day during that war, yet they are not famous.  Society does not seem to care about who is fighting, but only that they are fighting for their country. <br /> <br />     Catch-22 is a must-read for anyone finding interest in war.  It does well to hold the reader's attention.  The mixture of off-the-wall humor and obvious irony make it an enjoyable read.  It may or may not be historically accurate, but Heller probably did not intend for it to be.  Pick it up; if you don't like the first two pages, then don't bother reading it, but if you do, you'll enjoy the rest of the book.

B000002J1U|5.0|This is an album that never really caught up to the rest of its pack. Though included in the highly respected I-V series, Being of ZEPPELINs first five albums, this one is often disregarded as soft, or \\"not the best...\\"<br /><br />The fact is here, ZEPPELIN III offers up a little something of its own. Like all the first ZEP albums, there is no need to compare it to anything else. It is its own body, and I think this album holds up extremely well against the rest of its larger than life family.<br /><br />While most of this album is acoustic, the opening is the firey intense, blast of energy IMMIGRANT SONG. This is instantly one of Zeppelins most recognizable riffs, along with the battle cries of Robert Plant; some might say it's too short, but it's effective as an opener to an acoustic based album.<br /><br />FRIENDS and CELEBRATION DAY: These two songs work extremely well together. Some of my favorite Zeppelin right here.<br /><br />SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVING YOU: Play this one for your babys mamma every night when you get home. If she tries to nag you about ANYTHING put this tune on. \\"Workin' from seven to eleven every night really makes LIFE A DRAG!\\"<br /><br />OUT ON THE TILES: Another rocker, very fast paced, almost punkish driving riff.<br /><br />GALLOWS POLE: Is a song that starts very slow and cool and builds tempo as it goes on. The guitars are mesmorizing in this one and the vocals get all kinds of crazy as it peeks. Awesome song.<br /><br />TANGERINE: Amazing song, slow and sweet, the next one isn't as epic but also another nice one THATS THE WAY.<br /><br />BRON-Y-AUR STOMP: Killer song! A ditty on the acoustic, tap your toes, whatever you say about it, this song rules.<br /><br />HATS OFF: To bad this last song isn't worth spit, I think it tarnished this albums reputation for a million years to come.  Not by much though, I bet 95% of all the reveiws you read will give this album five stars, at least. It's Zeppelin, if you like 'em once, you'll like em again.<br /><br />WORTHY ALBUMonce, you'll like em again.  <br />WORTHY ALBUM

B000A0GP4K|5.0|I been a fan of Bob Dylan for about 3 months now and this dvd blew me away!!
B00004XOWM|3.0|People are giving this album a one star rating simply because of lead singer Fred Durst. Look beyond the singer people! There are talented musicians behind the oddball frontman. Wes Borland and Sam Rivers churn out heavy, head banging riffs while the drummer lays down the heavy beat.  <br /> <br />However, this was not a top notch album. He did take famous melodies from classic bands, change the lyrics, and call it his own. This is disgraceful, a true indication of a lack of creativity and imagination. That made me angry, and no song with different lyrics to classic melodies is classified as a good song. <br /> <br />Fred Durst needs to change his singing, or rather \\"yelling\\" habits. Dropping the F-bomb every 5 seconds is pretty pathetic, especially for a band who was supposed to have a great future. What I mean by this is that you don't need to cuss extensively to have a good record. <br /> <br />Then again, this is not a one star album. The guitar flawlessly produces a quality melody and the rhythm section keeps the pace of the song rather fast, and intense. This band is not a talentless group of musicians, but rather 3 guys with a hard working attitude towards music with a frontman who could change his songwriting habits.
B0000009SY|5.0|To truly appreciate the masterpiece \\"Joe's Garage\\", you can't just listen to a song or two and skip around. Take this double CD package with you the next time you have a long drive. Listen to the whole thing continuously, and in order, and you will reach a level of understanding that most Disciples of Zappa have known for years.<br /><br />The Central Scrutinizer is your host and narrater on this strange and wonderful journey. The bottom line of this work is a public outcry against government and censorship. This story takes the listener to the extreme and the story ends with music (of any kind) being illegal.<br /><br />Our hero Joe, starts off the album in a garage band. We then follow his adventures as he loses his Catholic girlfriend to a rock group, gets the clap from yet another girl, gets religion, falls in love with a robot, goes to prison, makes imaginary music in his mind, and is then released into a sterile and cold society.<br /><br />The music to this story is nothing short of brilliant and amazing. The song \\"Joe's Garage\\" starts off with lyrics that have been emblazened into the memory of every Zappahead. \\"Crew Slut\\", \\"Catholic Girls\\", and \\"Why does it hurt when I pee\\" are brilliantly orchestrated and have that biting humor that only Frank Zappa can do.<br /><br />This album has some lewd and offensive lyrics, but would you want Frank to be any other way? I do not recall how many references there are to oral sex on this album, perhaps no one does, but they are multiple. Also you can't help but laugh at the lyrics \\"Keep it Greezy so it'll go down easy\\". How else could you describe homosexual sex in a prison?<br /><br />Frank Zappa is badly missed by all who know and love his work. If you have Apostrophe and a Greatest Hits collection and want to venture out a little deeper into the world of Uncle FZ, I suggest Joe's Garage. It is an enormous work and it entertains at so many levels. When you begin to listen to this, I really do suggest listening to the whole thing in one long session if you've never heard it before. It's the only way to REALLY appreciate it.ng to the whole thing in one long session if you've never heard it before. It's the only way to REALLY appreciate it. <br /> <br />
1400031362|3.0|The first book in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series is a masterpiece, a work of folk tradition, a mystery, a story about the strength of strong-willed women, and a heart-warming tale.  As Smith has written more books, they haven't been able to live up to the high bar set by the first.  This is more a sleuth story and less of a piece of literature.  The mysteries themselves are kind of boring and without the spicy resolutions of the first book.  Precious never gets to employ her special brand of folk wisdom to solve a crime.<br /><br />If you are just starting the series, read the books in order, and don't expect everything to live up to the first one.

0385720920|4.0|My first Palahniuk was Invsible Monsters, and I highly recommend that along with Diary and Survivor if you want an intro to this literary master. Even as a fan, I had trouble both stomaching the content of Choke and liking the overall structure and message.<br /><br />Overall this book is just gross, and not in the fun irreverant way that Invisible Monsters is. Palahniuk commences once big gross-out fest with degrading acts of sex addicts, detailed descriptions of chewing and choking on food, debilitated nursing home patients, the slow starvation of a character, and the neverending description of narrator's bowel trouble.<br /><br />Is there a plot to this book? Was our narrator truly trying to overcome his addiction or was he just being a punk? Why pay for your mom's care if you secretly want her to die? All along, I was expecting a twist to make up for the rest of the book and explain everything to me, but it never came. I was just left with a great big feeling of \\"Eh,\\" amd \\"Ewwww[...]\\"<br /><br />I urge anyone who dislikes Palahniuk solely on the basis of this book to give one of his other works (but NOT Haunted) a try. This book has a small but dedicated audience, and there is much more to Palahniuk as a master storyteller.

0385338082|3.0|In the Shopaholic series, we had Becky Bloomwood with her passivity and tendency to stick her head in the sand balanced by her witty confessionals about shopping and some funny moments.  In this novel, Kinsella again brings back a vapidly passive main character, and the formula falls flat on its face, without the witticisms to save it.  Emma is beyond belief in her wishy-washiness, letting everyone around her ruin her life while she sits on and says nothing.  As a reader, I was irritated with the main character, and her dilemmas seemed dreadfully drawn out, with the conclusion obvious to the reader from miles away.<br /><br />The Shopaholic books are charming gems of chick lit.  Kinsella does not score so high on this novel.

0316096199|5.0|When I was a student at Syracuse University, I never heard of Alice Sebold, but every girl (and boy, for that matter) knew never to walk through Thornden Park at night.  20 years after her rape in this dark park, students don't all know her by name, but they know the park is a dangerous and scary place.  Alice was supremely innocent and naive when she was raped (it was her first sexual experience), a fact that the judge in her case could never grasp.<br /><br />Is this a recovery memoir?  Throughout the book, Alice convinces herself and the reader that she is recovering.  She goes through phases of anger, reckless behavior, being withdrawn, and the gradual acceptance of new friends.  At the end of the book, Alice reveals that as well as she thought she was doing, she had a lot more recovery to do the rest of her life.  The reader is forced to reconcile the fact that as painful as everything Alice went through was, she wasn't done dealing with the trauma.<br /><br />The investigation and trial of Alice's rapist is eye-opening and gut-wrenching.  I started reading that part of the book pretty much assuming Alice would win.  She was wronged, he's bad, end of story, right?  There was so much more to it, and my eyes were opened wide.  Alice reprints her testimony verbatim, interspersed with descriptions and explanations, and the reader can feel the tension in the courtroom as they go through the trial.  I was on pins and needles during the trial chapters, and I can only imagine what it was like for those present.<br /><br />Alice has done the world a service by telling this story, by offering the inside look from the victim's point of view.  This is an important read for all mature teenagers and all college-age girls.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is to Nu-Metal what Nirvana was to hair metal, the DEATH SENTENCE.  I can't go back to any nu-metal anymore after listening to this CD, with the exception of Mushroomhead and MuDvAyNe (but both they're so incredibly talented with their CD's ,namely MuDvAyNe's L.D. 50 and Mushroomhead's XX sounding like nothing outthere at the time,i should slap myself for lumping them into the Nu-metal genre). <br /> <br />No one gives \\"Sidewider\\" any love.  The moment when the drums and bass kick in to accompany the guitars, i loved it, couldn't get enough of it.  Then the acoustic guitar, what can I say, other than phenomenal. <br /> <br />The reason M. Shadows stopped screaming is b/c everybody now screams and nobody does it with remotely any talent with the exception of Chad Gray (but he can go from savagery to beauty in a split second).  Take the lead singer of Opeth, the single starts good, but then he does that crap low-pitched growl that made me turn the channel a second later. <br /> <br />Avenged Sevenfold changed their singing b/c they knew their instruments wouldn't get the attention they deserve, especially The Rev on drums, Zachy and Sinister who can both play killer solos. <br /> <br />I think of them as the opposite of MuDvAyNe, MuDvAyNe had the killer facepaint and got your attention then you take the time to listen to their instruments, especially on \\"Nothing to Gein\\", \\"Severed\\", \\"Cradle\\" and \\"(K)now F(orever)\\" and listen to Ryan Martinie play the best bass that I've ever heard.  Avenged Sevenfold get their distinction by playing great heavy metal.  20 seconds into \\"the Beast and the Harlot\\" and i thought, \\"This is Motley Crue, Maiden, Metallica, Priest and Zepellin all rolled up into one.\\"  They get your attention by not doing the typical thing in metal now and sing, well, and be able to play their instruments with great talent that makes me respect them more than almost any metal/nu-metal/rock band to debut or have a CD come out in the past couple of years.

B00006FM77|5.0|Hasta la publicacin de este trabajo el grupo Chicago haca una msica jazz-rock magnfica y este concierto fue la compilacin de sus fantasticas craciones. En las siguientes composiciones se volvieron ms \\"blandos\\" pasando a un pop comercial que, la verdad, no est a la altura de lo hecho hasta entonces. La presente reedicin de aquellos conciertos, es de gran calidad y me han gustado mucho los posters y libreto incluidos, iguales a los originales que acompaaban al vinilo. Quien quiera conocer la primera etapa de Chicago, que para mi gusto es la realmente interesante, no debe dejar de comprar este cuadruple cd y para aquellos que ya la conocen y aprecian, tiene el aliciente del cuarto cd, con varios \\"bonus tracks\\", que consisten en canciones repetidas que se interpretaron en dichos conciertos, pero no incluidas en el vinilo original.

0596007124|1.0|Unfortunately I can't give this zero stars.<br /><br />I bought the book on the strength of the Amazon reviews. I'd expected a \\"lighter\\" style. However, I didn't expect it to be like a history book for 13 year-old school kids, desperately trying to try to make the subject \\"interesting\\". Hardly any paragraphs over 100 words lest the audience's attention span be exceeded. If I'd wanted a comedy book, I'd have bought one. The only way that it could have been worse would have been to make it a \\"pop-up\\" book. For me this is a book for people that have not acquired the skill of reading by regularly reading journals, magazines and books.<br /><br />This book was such a disappointment that it's the only one that I've ever returned to Amazon (out of over 300 - that puts it below the bottom 0.3% of my rating).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Finally being able to watch the pilot and episodes in order gives a tantalizing taste of what could have been a great show.  The writing is tight, the acting is great, and Whedon's universe building skills (honed on Buffy & Angel) make for great TV.  It's rare that mainstream networks have a clue what to do with good sci-fi or space opera.
B000002AVF|5.0|It's hard to decide which CD is Mariah's best.  Daydream is first on my list with Buttefly and Music Box as runner-ups.  The reason I love this CD so much is because it has such variation from the club-like song \\"Fantasy\\" to \\"One Sweet Day,\\" a beautiful ballad with Boyz II Men.  The R&B song \\"Always be My Baby\\" stands out too. Not only does she has #1 songs, but there aren't any filler tracks.  Every song has its place on this CD.  Some songs like \\"Melt Away\\" and \\"When I Saw You\\" are often forgotten, but they are beautiful songs. Buy this CD.  Listen and love every track.
B000002G0P|5.0|I can't add anything new to the reviews that have already been written.  Just wanted to express how incredible this album is, and how well it has held up over the years.  In fact I was just listening to it this morning, which is what brought me here.  Such a shame that this never got the credit it deserves, I would love to see this band get back together and do a follow up to this one.  Then again, maybe not, perspectives change, and sequels never live up to the original.  If you somehow stumbled on this selection, and do not have this cd, LISTEN to all of the positive reviews and get it.  For pete's sake it's only like 50 cents used...

B000002WUD|4.0|Towards the end of his life, Elvis was showing signs of burnout and depression, even then, he could still rise to the occassion and belt out a great performance. This is the most comprehensive collection of his 1970's recordings available.  It starts off with the classic \\"The Wonder Of You\\" and takes you right through all of the singles released before his pre-mature death, several great album cuts and alternate recordings, and a sample of his live show on the last CD.  His outstanding performances on \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Moody Blue\\" show what he was capable of in the months before his death.  Makes you think of what might have been...

B000002WNP|4.0|Proof that Elvis had many fine recordings during the 60's!  Even though some of the material may not be the best, Elvis' performances are.  I was impressed by many of the early 60's recordings, that I had not heard before.  A very strong but incomplete collection!  Unfortunately, this box set does not include several of Elvis' 60's hits from his movies or his Gospel songs.  This is especially disconcerting for a box set (the only Grammies he won were for his Gospel recordings!).  If you are going to buy this box set, you should go ahead a buy the 2 CD release \\"Command Performances: The Essential 60's Masters II\\" and the 2 CD \\"Amazing Grace: His Greatest Sacred Performances\\" to fill in the holes in this collection.<br /><br />They should have just added a CD or two to this box set and included some of his key movie and Gospel songs in a single collection, but then they would have only had a shot at one GOLD Record Award instead of two or three...
B000AA305M|4.0|Another fine album from David Gray.  I enjoyed his last album immensely (my wife and I danced to \\"Be Mine\\" at our wedding), and thought it highly underrated. <br /> <br />At first listen, I really thought this album was much too slow and boring, but I must say with each listen, it has improved, and dramatically so.  The listener's patience will be rewarded here.  There are many subtleties to the songs that are not heard upon first listen.  Especially enjoy \\"One I Love\\" and \\"Disappearing World.\\"
B000002WMH|5.0|This is a comprehensive collection of Elvis' most influential work.  Not every song is a classic, but there are many classics here.

B00005YJMX|5.0|Though there are hundreds of takes on the 1922 classic, I firmly believe that this, Nosferatu: The Vampyre, is one of the greatest of them all. Klaus' performance alone is worth the purchase. He is truly menacing, and indeed creepy. He pants at the sight of blood and runs with coffin underarm. To put it plainly: If Dracula were a real person walking amongst us, KLAUS would be him. Werener's directing is wonderful, as expected. This movie is not dialogue heavy but instead Werner focuses his camera on scenery. Long stills on moody mountain plains; Shots of the ship sailing across the Black Sea; Stills of the dreary tower in the town; all conveying a gloom and a surreal evil feel throughout the entire movie. The acting is very well done but again, not dialogue heavy. All in all, a great movie. On a side-note, the musical score is amazing! <br />and Klaus' performance when Harker cuts him-self can give me goosebumps.

B00005JNS5|5.0|When we were living in New York City, and I was twelve, my Dad told my Mom that he was taking me somewhere for a few hours.  To my delight, we ended up at a ratty movie theater on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  These were the days before the monster multi-plexes.  I can't remember the exact address, but it was a large one room gig that had seen it's better days.  From what I could tell, some cool guy had come up with the idea of programming this low-rent theater with old Samurai flicks usually starting with the name Yojimbo...Yojimbo meets the One-Armed Warrior...you get the idea. <br /> <br />So, my Dad is paying for the two of us, and right before we walk inside he leans down and says to me, \\"You know, this is the closest thing I've ever seen to understanding the differences between the East and West.\\"  You gotta understand that my Dad hardly ever said anything.  So, this comment blew me away.  My attention was riveted.  It took me by the collar and pulled my focus away from the windex/old candy odor of the floors, the torn seat cushions where I was sure some old rats called home, and the dirty beach towel someone had hung to keep the light out of the hallway into the \\"theater.\\" <br /> <br />The movie exceeded my expectations.  It all starts with the shot of a gangster with tatoos all over the back of his body.  Safe to say, even if you've seen or read the Illustrated Man, you've never seen anything like this before.  I mean who the heck would ever let anyone tattoo them from neck to toe?  You've basically got it all.  Robert Mitchum in his creaky, world-weary mode, delivering lines like a T-Rex with attitude.  You've got supporting roles from the likes of Brian Keith who brings a sad, pathetic lining to his double-crossing, gambling freak role.  How far you've come from that crappy seventies TV family show--dude, you can act! <br /> <br />Then, you've got a terrific foil for Mitchum in one of Japan's leading actors of all time.  The hate between these characters is communicated in a glance, in the quiet way lines are delivered.  The two men both loved the same woman--and she only took up with Mitchum's character because she thought her husband was dead.  What a sad, true-to-life premise.  Circling the three are a band of wolves, the gangsters from this Japanese Organized Crime Syndicate aka The Yakuza. <br /> <br />Hold onto your hat when the bad guys invade the private home and literally mow down the Westerners--sticking a sword in the gut of one guy.  I am telling you, when this happened, I thought I could feel the cold metal entering my spleen.  It all winds up with a really great take-the-battle-to-the-enemy conclusion where Mitchum goes in with his metal boot kicking down rice paper walls, with two shotguns blazing.  The sword work is elegant, terrifying and so real, again, it hurts. <br /> <br />But, the real scene that you will always remember is the denoument, when Mitchum slices off the tip of his finger, what appears to be real perspiration rolling down his forehead, and offers it as a gift to atone for his wrongdoing.  I thought about this ending for years.  I kept hearing my Dad's voice whispering in my ear outside on the sidewalk...the differences between East and West.   <br /> <br />Watch this movie in your best \\"Lost in Translation\\" mode.  Know that it is an original painting--nothing about it is derivative.  Give it a chance to breathe.  Ask yourself, what if this were me?  Would I walk into a massacre about to happen out of honor?  In the end, the message, I think, is that an honorable life is the only way to go for men and women who only have their honor at the end of the day. <br />
B0000214F0|2.0|The story had possibilities given the cast.  However, it was ruined by the graphic violence and the orgy scenes.  I think all that was driven by Guccione's pretenious ego.
B00006LLOB|4.0|The Howlin' Wolf London sessions made The Wolf known to a larger audience who probably wouldn't have picked up the album or noticed any other Howlin' Wolf material were it not for the big name musicians (Clapton, Winwood, Wyman, Watts, et al) and a really colorful cover (Let's face it, the old Chess re-issues didn't exactly catch anyone's eye).  Unlike may other efforts  at fusing young British and old American blues players, this one works well enough to be worthy of continuted availabiltiy and re-issue. <br /> <br />To appreciate this better, remember it was recorded around  1970, not 1948.  The sound was different, the times were different, and the audience was different.   <br /> <br />I got to see the Wolf shortly after this came out.  No recording ever captured the mesmerizing nature of his voice.   <br /> <br />This is a fun recording and I encourage listeners to enjoy it for what it is---a dynamic (and slightly imperfect) collaboration that added something to the blues and rock fusion that shaped a good deal of our musical heritage.
B00008PC2O|1.0|I love this movie, but the High Def version installs a program so it can play on your computer. Unlike ALL of the OTHER windows media version movies I have, this one MUST have THEIR program installed and you MUST have an internet connection available to check if it is a valid copy. Well, when I installed it, the movie worked fine. The picture quality was first rate and the sound as good as any movie. However, the problems came about when I stopped the movie about 30 minutes into it to do something else that I had to do. It first froze up my computer and then it would boot up and none of my desktop icons would show. I rebooted it and it would work sometimes for a few minutes and then quit working again, hiding all of my icons. It wasn't a virus either. I check for viruses a lot. Anyway, it eventually wouldn't allow me to do anything at all and I had to reformat my hard drive to get rid of the problem,. Quite a bit of hassle for a 2 hour video. <br />I would suggest that you NOT buy this product unless you are willing to just watch the DVD version. I think the company who made it should have followed suit with everyone else and made it so it could be played through windows media, but they were probably just so darned worried that their precious video would be stolen that they made it screw your computer up.

1592400876|4.0|I found this book hilarious.  Maybe it was just because I was so happy to finally have a nerdy friend I could joke around with about grammar and punctuation.  Or maybe it's because I'd just read \\"Woe is I,\\" a book whose author tries so desperately to be funny yet never succeeds.  Or, maybe, this book really is hilarious.<br /><br />I think it's possible.<br /><br />\\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is a fun read.  It goes on for a chapter or two too long, I disagree with its stance on the Oxford (or serial) comma and on the semi-colon, and some of her anecdotes I'd read elsewhere first, but overall this book is about as entertaining as a book on this subject can get.<br /><br />It's the perefect sort of book for people who really need help with punctuation but who would probably never read a grammar book.<br /><br />I would recommend it to almost anyone.
0553212737|4.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress ir vex her.\\" <br />So begins Jane Austen's classic novel of the mishaps of matchmaking. Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel. <br />Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral. <br />I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen.

B00005JNEI|5.0|This is one of the most controversial documentaries in the past few years. And, boy, is it a joy to watch! Especially for all of us liberals. Nothing that director Michael Moore presents should be new to us, but the fact that this film caused so much controversy is positive. If you are a republican you will put Mr. Moore on your \\"enemies\\" list, if you're a liberal you will most likely be showing this movie to all of your republican friends going \\"see? see? i told you so...\\".  <br /> <br />Mr. Moore goes to many lengths to show how, in the end, the links between the Bush family and some \\"sketchy\\" groups, as in helping the Taliban regime rise to power in Afghanistan in the 1990's only to be marked as enemies a decade later when the interests changed. However, one should watch these kind of opinion pieces with an absent mind and then form an opinion, as Mr. Moore does not ask the question \\"what could be the ties of the Kennedys, Clintons and other politicians to also some 'sketchy' individuals or organizations?\\". <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this is a must see movie. For Republicans and Democrats. In fact, throw a party, have some Republicans and Democrats come together, and watch the movie! That should be fun and stir some waters! That's all we need! Action! Controversy! Get the people discussing issues. In the end, bring the power to \\"we the people\\" and don't let it sit in some closed circles, Republican or Democrat, as it only hinders Democracy!
0689865384|5.0|A while ago, I read about this book and thought that it sounded interesting, so I borrowed it from the library. i was almost nothing like I expected it to be... in fact it was a hundred times better. Hence, I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to read it. I was fascinated by certain concepts, such as the \\"perfect human\\" (which we happen to be discussing in my English class) and the mistakes of the past. The characters were all extremely interesting and well developed. I cannot wait until I get a chance to know what will happen in the next book!
0205313426|5.0|This is the original and still the best, updated with today's usage. Clearly written, easy to comprehend, easy to use to find the answer to your grammar or style question. Anyone who puts pen to paper needs this book on his shelf!
B000AL730Y|5.0|I have been listening to this album for 2 weeks now and that is at least a week and half longer than I listened to Driving Rain.  It has grown on me every time I listen to it.  Even my 9 year old loves it as we drive in the car.  Her favorite is English Rain.  I've been a Beatle nut since 1980 when Lennon was killed & I was 14.  I became mesmerized by the media coverage and the music.  I have anxiously awaited all releases since then.  I never fully appreciated Tug Of War, because at 16 I was looking for harder music.  I think Chaos is the best McCartney has given us since 1980 & I hope he continues to work w/ Godrich to develop a relationship similar to cash / Rubin. The play-it-yourself technique seems to work fantastic for Paul & I am sure I will enjoy this CD for a long time.  Highly recommended.
B0000019PA|5.0|Well, this has been a long search.  I bought this CD on a recommendation from someone - I can't remember who, so it must have come to me in a wonderful dream.  There is sadly nothing much original in this world but Jeff Mangum has given us an undeniable collection of outrageously new and vibrant songs.  His voice is not mellifluous by any measure and he doesn't always hit his notes but I, for one, am sick of the over-produced work that is kicked out of today's music studios - made for radio airtime, hoping for what they call a \\"hit\\".  Not everything here is brilliant but there are no dead tracks.  NMH is really Jeff - or rather they were, since they have disbanded.  He belts out his Dylanesque urban poetry like a drunken Irish folk singer in a Dublin pub.  But make no mistake, this man is a genius and his Louisiana influences are absolutely clear in his rhythmic rhymes and choice of instruments - trumpets, accordions and anything else that will make a good sound.  With lyrics like \\"The only girl I've ever loved, Was born with roses in here eyes, But then they Buried her alive, One evening 1945\\" (and there's much more), I am bound to believe that there is hope yet for modern music.  Let's hope Jeff gets a new band together.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Of course, this is for \\"Alien\\" fans. I don't understand why other people downplay the fourth movie so much, of course the 1st and 2nd are incredible. And, the other two are still more of a good thing. A friend bought all 4 double disc sets. This set gives you more than the ninth disc, at a lower price! Each extra disc also contains more detail. So, if you love \\"Alien(s)\\", get this, especially  now at this new lower price! <br />Enjoy!
B00005JNQS|5.0|My 13 year-old and 8 year-old and I throroughly enjoyed this movie.  I was tempted to not buy it based on the less-than-stellar reviews on this site.   I am glad I bought it anyway.   It's funny, smart, and has enough inside jokes for us without being arrogant about what a witty movie it is.   My kids prefer cerebral comedy, and this delivers.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Another excellent sci-fi series that met a premature death. As most buffs are aware with the rare exception of Star Trek and Bab-5 the stations just dont have a clue about sci-fi and what keeps true buffs interested. There is a simple plot line with various well blended offshoots, good character chemistry and the right balance of emphais on character development and effects/action. Very plausible and easy to watch. Hope the movie ties up the loose ends.
B000002ULO|1.0|McCartney's well of course dried up thirty years ago, but then along comes Calico Skies, a fantastic tune that would be right in place on the White Album.  But don't buy Flaming Pie (an otherwise suckified album) to get it - get ahold of the live version of the song that appears on Back In The World - it is much better.  However, the lovely rich tonality of Mick's guitar on the studio version is definitely something worth checking out, for those in the crowd that care about such things (even if the track sounds about one notch above a demo vocally).    Man, this was so nice to hear after such a dry spell - I've worn the threads off this song playing it.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|A year ago I heard Agatis Byrjun for the first time and I was immediately transformed into a Sigur Ros fan. That album still ranks among my top ten favorites of all time. So, I did not hesitate to purchase () which is an incredible album as well. After that I found Von, and simultaneously, disappointment. Of course, Von was their first album and first albums aren't always that great. Anyway, when I discovered that Takk was coming out, anticipation swallowed me. Unfortunately, this album does not seem to live up to their last two. This album reminds me more of Von in some ways than it does of their others. Now I am not saying that this album is totally bad as it does have some high points. Glosoli is a fantastic song. Tracks 3, 6, and 7 are good as well.  <br />Now please bear in mind that I have only listened to this album one and a half times, so there is a chance that it will grow on me. But, everything on the album seems to sound the same. Yes, there is a minimalistic quality with Sigur Ros. But on their last two albums, especially Ajatis, every song stood out as its own individual masterpiece, and I loved those two albums after the first listen. I did not have that same reaction with Takk, and that is unfortunate.  <br />Also, I chose to give this album four stars rather than three because it still towers over the majority of abrasive noise  that people accept as music nowadays.
B000002TQV|5.0|One Radiohead's best. Their lyrics are deep and emotional, and most are very relaxing. Buy this, it's a great album. The guitarwork and other effects make each song just more sweeter. and I pity the guy who said Radiohead was a moderized version of U2...At least Radiohead didnt make a horrible song like Vertigo. Anyways, if you liked other Radiohead albums, this needs to be part of your collection.

B00002E224|5.0|A filmophile friend of mine kept encouraging me to rent \\"Before Sunrise.\\" So finally, with my reading and work caught up (and a Netflix trial), I finally rented it, only to fall in love with a romance that was utterly charming, unassuming, organic, and totally real; I was swept into the tiny alleys of Vienna along with the film's protagonists. At first, the plot seems pedestrian enough: aloof French beauty and moody American tourist stuck on train meet, hit it off, and spend the night together. But the depth of the dialogue (the basis of the whole film), the very natural acting, and the onscreen chemistry of two soulmates, along with the beautiful cinematography of Europe, made this a gem.<br /><br />Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is running away from a failed relationship, due to board a plane to the U.S. the next morning. C&eacute;line, a headstrong Parisian, is a writer and passionate feminist on her way home from visiting her grandmother in Budapest. The two are thrown together after escaping an ugly confrontation by a married German-speaking couple, and C&eacute;line is quickly drawn in by Jesse's stories and quirky sense of humor. He convinces her to get off the train at Vienna and spend the day with him, since he doesn't have money for a hotel. The two let the city lead them where it will, and Wien (Vienna) shows her charms in unexpected ways: graceful palaces, amusement parks, local dives, palm readers, vagabond poets, monasteries, cemeteries, churches and sidewalk cafes.<br /><br />The pacing is leisurely to say the least. C&eacute;line and Jesse candidly engage on conversations covering every topic imaginable, from what love means to each of them (a touchy subject), cultural stereotypes, reincarnation, death, pretend phone conversations on what attracted them to each other, and bashful first kisses. Their growing attraction is shown in tender moments: the two staring at each other and looking away while listening to a record in a booth, Jesse's hand reaching out to brush C&eacute;line's curls, but quickly drawing away, a kiss shared in a Ferris wheel at sunset.<br /><br />This is a beautiful romance that feels totally real: no Hollywood stereotypes, only honesty, pain, and tenderness. I can't imagine how hard it must have been to make the dialogue so organic - this almost feels like a documentary, as if someone was following them and filming their blossoming romance.<br /><br />Ten years later, Richard Linklater released the sequel, \\"Before Sunset,\\" in which Jesse and C&eacute;line are reunited in Paris. I haven't seen it yet, but if it is even a fraction as magical as \\"Before Sunrise,\\" I can't wait to see what the future holds in store for Jesse and C&eacute;line.<br /><br />The film is rated R for language (profanity).rls, but quickly drawing away, a kiss shared in a Ferris wheel at sunset. <br /> <br />This is a beautiful romance that feels totally real: no Hollywood stereotypes, only honesty, pain, and tenderness.

B000A3XYZA|5.0|I have seen my share of dusty, mothballed productions of Handel operas and at this point I look forward to modern productions; it seems Handel, and opera seria in general can work particularly well in highly stylized stagings and this Glyndebourne version, directed by Jean-Marie Villegier, is a feast for the eyes, ears and the brain; there's no powdered wig or corset in sight, and the modern context of whole story is skillfully played up.<br />Set in the \\"silent movie\\" period, lighted in stark contrasts, with beautifully realized black and white film feel to it, this is a very distinctive looking production; the costumes and make up all add to the visual splendour.<br />Musically, it could not be better; under the direction of William Christie, the playing of Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is tight, crisp and just about perfect, and the soloists excel both vocally and dramatically.<br />Anna Catrina Antonacci is incredibly intense in the title role- this is not an elegantly poised Handel delivered at an arm's length. Andreas Scholl plays Bertarido; his singing is impeccable, and who knew coolly restrained Scholl had it in him to deliver such a moving performance on stage! All his arias are standouts and he brings the house down with Viva Tiranno in Act III. There's plenty of Senesino's roles left for Scholl to play, and it looks like he's on his way to become a blazing hot star on the opera circuit.<br />As for the rest of the cast: Kurt Streit as Grimaldo, Umberto Chiummo as Garibaldo, Louise Winter as Eduige, Artur Stefanowicz as Unulfo et al, are just as good- there are no weak links here. This is one of Handel's operas where the plot actually makes sense and this is an extraordinary group of performers who can act and sing the hell out of Handel at the same time.<br />The DVD package is very spare- no extras of any kind, but there are subtitles in several languages, and the sound and picture quality are excellent.<br />For any Baroque opera lover, this is a must-have; for everybody else, this is a great piece of musical theatre of the highest caliber, brilliant, often unnerving and extremely moving, and, methinks, highly accessible; this is Handel for the modern age. Five stars and counting- let's just hope there's more where this came from.ody else, this is a great piece of musical theatre of the highest caliber, brilliant, often unnerving and extremely moving, and, methinks, highly accessible; this is Handel for the modern age.

B00025ETIW|5.0|This is a great rock and roll album. It has nothing to do with suicide. If you want to listen to happy songs maybe you should try listening to the backstreet boys, not my chemical romance. Yeah, the songs are sad and obscure, but thats what makes the band, it is mainly a dark band. Music doesn't kill people. People do. I really don't care if that story was true or not but if it was, it wasn't because of the music.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|One of the all time great movies!  We were happy with the quality of the DVD and the supplementary info on the making of the movie.  Definitely recommended!
B0007MVXQG|3.0|The big return effort of Rob coming back to Judas Priest.  Honestly, I wish he would have stayed away.  Rob's solo band Halford was A LOT better.  For those that haven't heard them check out Halford's \\"Live Insurrection\\".  It's got to be one of the all time greatest live performances. <br /> <br />Angel of Retribution is alright, but it isn't quite as heavy as Halford and the vocals aren't as good.  I bought it just for the DVD part of the disc which I was hoping the live stuff would come close to the quality of \\"Live Insurrection\\", but it wasn't.  I was looking for the goose bumps you get when you see something powerful.  For example, Doro's DVD \\"Fur Immer\\" which has the entire Cave concert.  That was a powerful performance. <br /> <br />Overall, this effort is a listen to once and it will collect dust on the shelf....  but \\"Live Insurrection\\" will continue to get my attention.

B000AOJ9X0|5.0|The album \\"Bring Em In\\" is a worthy showcase of Buddy Guy's numerous talents.  Buddy Guy's vocal range, passion and emotion are awesome, as are his versatility, creativity and genius on guitar. The album should get another Grammy Awards nomination for this Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, 5-time Grammy winner and record 23-time WC Handy Blues Award winner.    Play the album loud.  The more you listen, the more the album will grow on you. It's a keeper and very enjoyable. Buddy doesn't do the simple, obvious or candy pop music.  He chooses instead to tantalize and take you down unexpected paths to build emotion and pleasantly surprise you. And addict you with his infectious singing and playing.  Buddy is like the Picasso of guitarists - you may not immediately realize or appreciate some of the things he does, leaving you more to discover when you play the album again.    In addition, there's a nice mix of songs as well as fusion of eclectic musical styles demonstrating Guy's broad range.  There's something for almost everyone from blues to R&B to soul to even psychedelic rock that would get Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page and Stevie Ray Vaughan to sit up and listen. As would fans of Carlos Santana, Keith Richards, John Mayer, Tracy Chapman, Anthony Hamilton, Keb Mo and Robert Randolph who are featured in mostly effective duets with Buddy. What I've found is that the CD is liked by people who don't know Buddy Guy or aren't blues fans, so it's good music to play while hanging out with friends or just relaxing. Most of the tracks are quite happy and uplifting in mood.    (...)     If one is open-minded, it's hard to find a track not to like in this Bring Em In album. There's nothing wrong with Buddy Guy's terrific singing or guitar playing.  However, whether a Buddy/blues fan is willing or not to accept some of the more mainstream songs is a matter of personal taste. For example, it took me a few listens of Buddy's duet with Tracy Chapman (Ain't No Sunshine) to realize how well they covered the song. And if hardcore blues fans believe \\"I've Got Dreams to Remember\\" is the weakest track, then this album is chockfull of outstanding  music for a larger mainstream audience. Yet the album also has a few pure blues tracks which are phenomenal.    Don't expect \\"the true Buddy\\" to be one-dimensional. And Buddy has a diverse fan base -- hardcore fans have different expectations of even the style of \\"blues\\" they want from Buddy because he's so talented and has 50 years of playing history. Although he is revered as a blues legend and the greatest blues guitarist, Buddy Guy can't be pigeon-holed into a single style such as \\"Chicago blues\\" (whatever that means) or song type. One unique attribute of Buddy Guy is his unmatched versatility and ability to play different music and styles.  No wonder Jimi Hendrix even cancelled his own concert to sit on the floor to learn from the guru and tape record Buddy Guy's stage performance. And Eric Clapton was inspired to develop a power-trio band (Cream) and Rod Stewart was his valet in the mid 1960s.    This Bring Em In album is an essential addition to the Buddy Guy collection. Buddy Guy wouldn't have won 5 Grammys in 12 years if he didn't have any excellent studio albums recently, such as Sweet Tea, Slippin In, Damn Right I've Got The Blues and Blues Singer.  And I also like the incredible \\"Stone Crazy\\" mentioned by David Casale above. Btw, 1981's \\"Stone Crazy\\" is NOT like a Chess album - it's almost 180 degrees different in style from his Chess albums in the early 1960s; the Chess record company didn't allow Buddy to record the \\"loud\\" guitar sounds he used in his live stage performances at the time.      I have only very minor complaints about the album. The studio band - though very good - at times lacked passion, oomph and imagination to fully support and leverage Buddy's incredible guitar playing. And the production and sound engineering at times didn't match or support Buddy's guitar as well as it could have (at other times it was excellent). And no CD can truly capture what an incredible live performer, showman and entertainer Buddy can be.   Regardless, these quibbles shouldn't affect most people from enjoying the album. It's  better than many of today's top-selling albums.    This is a 5 star album and will give much pleasure for years to come. It's ridiculous that such a talented artist like Buddy Guy - acclaimed by the top artists and guitarists as a musician's musician - has not achieved far more success, popular fame and radio play in this music industry. It isn't for lack of talent.    (I have been to numerous Buddy Guy shows so I can appreciate that hardcore Buddy fans are sometimes fanatical about Buddy's brilliant live performances. Buddy truly is one of the greatest live entertainers of all time. But it is not true that \\"Buddy live\\" will always \\"blow this record away.\\" Here's a simple reality check: Compare this \\"Bring Em In\\" album against all 11 live shows (January 2004 shows at Buddy Guy's Legends) which a real Buddy fan can get from piratebootlegs.com .  An objective reviewer will realize that there is no one complete show that can \\"blow this record away.\\" But of course there are many awesome live songs over those 11 shows that can make up an incredible double CD. What David has insisted is no different from what some hardcore fans of great live performers such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, etc. have been zealouly insisting for decades. But the sober reality is that some live shows are awesome and some are not, even for Zeppelin, Hendrix or Elvis.  I believe that most objective people will find this Bring Em In album to be highly enjoyable for years to come. Perhaps David Casale needs more time to appreciate the album. And perhaps David just needs to chill out and accept that this is an excellent Buddy Guy album which shows another part of his wide range of talents, even if it is not to his personal taste. I agree with Rude \\"The Bandit\\" - anyone who thinks this album is a dud must be a dud, or is highly biased or whatever. If Buddy wasn't so talented perhaps our expectations would be more reasonable.  Finally, about one of David Casale's assumptions -- I was referring to the 1981 US release of the Stone Crazy album by the Alligator label, not its originally France recording in October 1979.)
B000002UB3|4.0|By 1969 the Beatles were all but over, somehow out of the turmoil abbey road proves a fitting epitaph to the worlds greatest pop group. McCartney, perhaps with his eye on the bands legacy and disappointment with Phil spectors (over) production of `let it be' convinced George martin to come back and produce the record as they had in the past, abbey road also marks the point where George Harrison became lennon/mccartneys equal (although theirs was a partnership in name only at this juncture) `here comes the sun' and  `something' are easily the highlights of a sometimes patchy piece marred by McCartney's seeming insistence to put at least two tracks in his now trademark whimsy style, `Maxwell's silver hammer' & `oh darling' see also `honey pie' from the white album to `when I'm 64' from sgt pepper, on every release much to the annoyance of  Lennon whose contributions while minimal by his standards are essential from the beautiful `because' featuring amazing harmonies to `mean mr mustard'  `polythene pam'  and the swamp blues of `come together' though it is side two  where this album really  breaks new ground even for the beatles with McCartney orchestrating different fragments of leftover songs into a brilliant crescendo where various melody lines are interweaved to great effect and one can't help wonder how good this album could have been closing with the fitting `the end' with it's apt refrain the beatles were saying goodbye and is only spoiled by the tagged on  `her majesty'.
B000002GVO|1.0|Once upon a time there was a country-rock band called the Eagles. Everyone who was not a hillbilly found them incredibly annoying. One day, they decided to write a song about a hotel in California and call it (Here comes the big surprise) Hotel California. They then put it on an album that sold a bunch of copies. However, all those poor people didn't know that they had wasted a lot of money on songs that either turn out to be an ingenious combination of annoying and boring. The song Hotel California is one of the best-known of all time but really is just a bunch of hillbillys trying to sing and write good songs but coming up way, way short. And the rest isn't much better.

0451191153|5.0|Only thing that was keeping me from ever reading The Fountainhead were the dozen number of people who recommended it to me. It is a certified guaranteed winner as per most people (most of whom cannot frame a sentence without using words such as \\"nice\\" , \\"intelligent\\" ,\\"sweet\\" etc.)<br /><br />The Fountainhead is impactful,precise,gigantic in it's scope, the work of a mastermind. Ayn Rand shocked me(again) with her control over character definitions and flabbergasting logic. After I had finished reading Atlas Shrugged, I felt a bit cheated and robbed of my time. Don't get me wrong, \\"A.S\\" has my favourite book character of all time in Fransisco but it is the \\"giving in\\" nature of most characters in Atlas Shrugged that made it seem a bit too harsh to me.There is a certain preachiness in the words of John Galt that didn't really sell consequence. Moving on, about Fountainhead I'd like to say that it has the best and most well conceived perception of a human brain I've read. Some of my favourite characters in the book are Peter Keating, Gail Wynand (the best), Ellsworth Toohey (never has a character been this interesting in his villain own self) and the hero, Howard Roark. One very tactful and intentional foreplay of characters is the fact that they are all unique. You will never once in the book find a flaw or loophole in any of the characters. What I'm trying so hard to say will be better explained by examples.<br /><br />Howard Roark never says more than he thinks he must in this book and often says nothing when you'd expect him to talk. Gail Wynand doesn't ever give away his self respect into the hands of another and never begs anyone. Ellsworth Toohey never gets himself into trouble despite the mind riots he causes most lesser people in the book.<br /><br />Ayn Rand has an astounding quantity of mind. She shocks me repeatedly in this book by adding a shape to certain thoughts every 20 something year old guy goes through. I do not like the part where there is raw love between Howard Roark and Dominique because it seems a bit too barbaric and unrealistic for me to swallow. It's surprising how boring and dull the book became for a few pages when Roark and Dominique Francon meet. There is a certain sarcasm that the book displays in paragraphs containing comments made by the local people. Fountainhead was extremely funny in it's own silent subtle way at times.<br /><br />WHY IS IT BETTER THAN ATLAS SHRUGGED(to me)?<br />I hope I do not offend anyone by comparing the two but like many readers have pointed out, most characters of The Fountainhead grow on you and towards the last few pages your pace of reading declines(intentionally). Gail Wynand with his practicality and adaptation skills makes more of a hero than any of the much exaggerated Atlas Shrugged Characters. Atlas Shrugged is an epic in itself but it doesn't manage to grip you like The Fountainhead does. Most books ignore the character details of the villains but in Fountainhead, Ellsworth Toohey gets a whole lot of pages dedicated to him.<br />Gail Wynand with his \\"I Do\\" yacht was easily the most eyebrow raising thing in the book. Wynand fought a life against all odds. For him to believe in his own individual existence came as a shocker to me. Wynand is very inspiring. I won't say much because the more I talk of Gail Wynand, the more I feel I'm depriving him of a quality summary.<br />Ellsworth Toohey made me smile with how well knew the people around him. His attention to detail and \\"liquid cement memory\\" were both very well jotted down. Dominique Francon was a bit of a mixed bag which is why I don't mention her very often. She was almost half as bad as Dagny Taggart from Atlas Shrugged.<br /><br />To end what I had to say, The Fountainhead is the best book I have read in my life. It's reassuring, almost magical touch of brilliant storywriting , flawless character defintions and the much loved irony brings me down to my knees. I do not suggest this book to everyone maybebecause I do not think everyone will quite understand it. In any case, Enjoy whatever works.<br />I loved all reviews on this book because even the negative ones make a lot of sense come to think of it.stand it. In any case, Enjoy whatever works.

0895260131|5.0|This is the book that you need to read containing the information that you, our legislators, and our society in general needs know now concerning those people who are attacking western society daily in places like New York, Madrid Spain, England, and the Netherlands (to name only a recent few).   <br /> <br />As a soldier recently released from the Active Army, we were given small \\"cultural education\\" classes about the Arab world and the religion primarily practiced in the eastern regions - Islam.  The purpose was to give us an understanding of the environment and ultimately the mind/motivation of our enemy.  Never in all my training was I provided with the wealth of pertininent, factual, and thoroughly documented information that is contained in the Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam. <br /> <br />The book is a quick and easy read which keeps you engaged and interested.  Images and ideals portrayed in the news, schools, and through pro-Islamic lobbying groups that are being passed onto the unsuspecting and uneducated as fact about the \\"peace loving religion of Islam\\" are systematically discussed, exposed, and refuted using complete and \\"in context\\" references from the Koran, Sharia (Islmaic laws and interpretations of the Koran by leading religious leaders - past and present), documented historical references, the Bible, and more. <br /> <br />Having read Mr Spencer's book has allowed me to see past and current events in a much clearer, logical, and conscise context.  Instead of watching the news in horror wondering about those people who comitted the latest suicide bombing, shooting, kidnapping, conspiracy to injure my fellow citizens, or corrupt my way of life in the name of Allah and his prophet I can instead see the \\"writting on the wall.\\" <br /> <br />Read the Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and you too will see all of the signs and indicators that lead to past acts of violence and understand those that are currently revealing themselves daily.  The terrorist \\"how to\\" handbook and game plan has been around since about 460 AD.  Why are we as a culture and society still struggling to get a grip on those people and groups who are successfully killing us and trying to errode the liberties and ways of life we enjoy.  <br /> <br />To be certain, not all Muslims are terrorists; however, almost all terrorists are Muslim.  A great majority of Muslims may be moderate but Islam is not.  Know your enemy.  Read this book.

B00000JMP9|4.0|The singers are splendid and the chosen settings are fine, but at least one-sixth of the opera is missing.  The focus on the lovers is understandable in giving viewers the most memorable musical moments in the opera, but it violates the dramatic balance of the original opera.  The love of Charlotte and Werher needs to be seen in the context of a small-city milieu (Wetzlar, Germany) where people drink, play cards, and celebrate 50th wedding anniversaries.  We are shown the church and the townsfolk going and coming from the service, but we don't see the old pastor and wife who are being feted for their years of marriage.  That's an important foil to the disfunctional marriage of Charlotte and Albert and to the cause of that marriage:  Charlotte's promise to her dying mother to marry Albert.  It's also a foil to the foolish passion of Werther and the trouble that he causes for Charlotte and Albert.  In addition, the balance of the Christmas carol near the beginning of Act I (a rehearsal in June) with the performance a year and a half later when Werther lies dying of a bullet in his gut is lost because the children don't have their June rehearsal.  No wonder that some of these reviewers think the opera slow-moving. Paradoxically, the opera would seem more lively if more lively scenes were included, even if the opera ran its full length. <br /> <br />It must also be said that, contrary to the unhistoric view of one reviewer, Massenet's opera was not a last gasp of romantic opera before Puccini, but a forward step away from the traditional 5-act French opera with its \\"de rigeur\\" ballet and 3-4 hour length.  Massenet is looking forward to \\"Boheme\\" and \\"Butterfly,\\" not back to \\"Faust\\" and \\"Le Prophete,\\" for example. Nonetheless, I love what is here in the Weigl film and see it in light of my knowledge of the rest of the opera.   <br /> <br />(Secondary complaints: (1) The costumes are 19th century, but the action is 18th century.  (2) Werther fails to wear the costume specified by Goethe:  blue jacket and yellow-buff trousers.  That costume became favored by young would-be Werthers after the 1774 publication of the novel.)

B0001GL3K4|5.0|Definitely a chick flick repeater but a guy may only be able to sit through this once.  I, being a chick, thought this movie was sentimental, sweet, full of surprising turns, and definitely funny.  I especially liked the love god Colin and his quest for American girls.  I was so happy he was right about us trampy Americans and our vunerability to the suave English accent...HA!!!  He was so pathetic I wanted him to succeed.  What earns five stars in my book is when the movie is over I want to watch it again right away.  This definitely is it...GREAT MOVIE!!!
B00063EMJG|1.0|When I saw this CD & DVD at Walmart I thought I had found a treasure. I could not wait to get home and watch Neil Young singing and playing some of my favorite songs. Man was I shocked when all I saw was a LP turning around. I was so upset that I could not even hear the music. I took it back and demanded my money back. Who ever is putting this mess out is ripping us off. If Neil knows about this, then  I have lost a world of respect for him.
B00005MP58|5.0|I don't think anyone who has seen this movie could disagree that it is not only a great adaptation of a fabulous book, but probably one of the best movies ever made.  Only such great writing and direction could get you so involved in a story, so caught up in the romance, when you don't even see so much as a kiss until the very end!  This movie certainly puts modern romances to shame.
B0007QJ1MU|4.0|The last album by the Queens of the Stone Age was \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" a frenetic collection of the hardest kind of rock. It was a thrilling, visceral experience, not one soon forgotten. Then nude bassist Nick Oliveri departed from the band, taking the wilder edge of the band with him. Oh, what would become of the Queens of the Stone Age?<br /><br />Well, if \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is any indication, then they are doing fine. This album relies on Josh Homme, and it's stripped down to... well, not down to the bare bones, but some very strong, lean sinew. The albums opens with a little acoustic ballad, \\"Lullaby,\\" which starts things off on a strong footing.<br /><br />From there on, things get stranger -- fast paced songs that just keep speeding up, ominous buildups, and nightmarish undertones.There are moments of quieter catchiness -- \\"Little Sister\\" seems perfect for the album's first single. And a few tracks feel a bit like filler. But overall, \\"Lullabies\\" is very much in the flavour of the Queens' second album, \\"Rated R.\\" Only darker and somehow more whimsical.<br /><br />Singer/songwriter/guitarist Josh Homme gets to rule in this one. Truth be told, he ruled all through the Desert Sessions, Kyuss, and now he sits in the middle of the Queens of the Stone Age, like a sinister-but-not-evil mastermind. Oliveri's manic style and gimmicks are gone, and in their place is steady, dark rock'n'roll that takes strange and unexpected twists.<br /><br />It's not a concept album, but it feels that way -- the mood gets generally creepier as \\"Lullabies\\" goes on. Fuzzy guitars, dark metallic riffs, and eerie harmonies get a few unusual flourishes, such as that broken music box. And Homme's vocals blend into the songs like another instrument -- great stuff. It only emphasizes how central he is to the band's unique sound.<br /><br />Queens of the Stone Age seemed to be endangered when Oliveri departed, but \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" shows that the band is just fine. Not quite perfect, but a solid creation.ine. Not quite perfect, but a solid creation.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Great Album!  Binaural is probably in the top 3 greatest Pearl Jam albums, along with Ten and Vs. <br />One reason is its one of the best musically technical records for Pearl Jam. Matt Cameron's drumming also drives the band into another world of rythme and makes them sound heavier than ever.   <br />The finer songs of the album are the hard rocking \\"Insignificance\\", \\"Grievance\\", \\"Breakerfall\\" and \\"God's Dice\\". <br />The softer yet graceful tunes are \\"Light Years\\", \\"Thin Air\\", and \\"Parting Ways\\". \\"Soon Forget\\" is a well written little uke solo. <br />And of course, there's the melancholic yet beautiful \\"Nothing As It Seems\\".

B0000CAXIC|5.0|This is a prolific master piece put together with raw emotion, A deffinate building block in the new gen style music.  The Song \\"Hey, Johnny Park!\\" has a few of the most gripping lyrics to date in my opinion; Verses one and two (to long to write out).  Not to mention that this album has that song \\"Everlong\\"  yeah thats probbably The Foos best song ever.  This album is complete in the aspects that there are songs with a harder feel, a more heart touching feel and a slower catchy sunny afternoon sittin in the park smokin a bowl and haveing a relaxing feel good moment. <br /> <br />FOR MAXIMUM ENJOYMENT <br />Place in CD player.  Jam all the way through NON-STOP,  Repeat as needed.

B0007P3582|1.0|Really, come on people. It's obvious. 50 Cent cannot rap anymore; he used to be good when he had \\"Guess Who's Back\\" and \\"Power of the Dollar\\". And those idiots who are saying that this is a classic are really out of their minds. Those people saying that 50 Cent can rap better than Ja Rule isn't actually saying much, Ja Rule is also a terrible rapper and it doesn't take much to be better than him. And when you say that 50 Cent smashed Jadakiss, Ja Rule, Fat Joe and Nas on \\"Piggy Bank\\", how can you mean that? \\"My Fofo\\" is a much better diss, and it's the solid truth, not fake, rubbish made up stuff. Also, I notice that people say that 50 Cent is better than Fat Joe, Ja Rule and Jadakiss, just because of \\"Piggy Bank\\" so, what are you saying that he's the best rapper in the world? But then you say that he is better than those 3, so what's to say that there is someone better? You people really do not make sense, let alone type like a civilised person, you type like \\"OMFG!!!!! W00T!!1 dis album iz liek da best!!11\\", this is not AIM or MSN. Beats are not everything in rap, rap does have lyrics. Perhaps you JUST TRY and listen, instead of being brain dead and listening to just beats.  <br /> <br />If you want real rap, check out Biggie Smalls, 2Pac, Rakim, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Public Enemy, Nas, Ice Cube and many others. You see, there are plenty of other rappers that have talent, unlike 50 Cent. I rest my case, oh, and I know this will get good feedback, and hopefully will become a Spotlight review, so everybody can see it.
B0002858YS|4.0|The CD has some good songs. As with a lot of CDs, the songs grow on you after a while. Part of the group's appeal is the retro sound. They sound like they are from the 80s, which is good. A lot of the current music and music from the 90s is not that great and sounds the same. A lot of the songs have a haunting, melancholy sound that is pleasent to listen to and does not grate on your nerves.
B000A0GP4K|2.0|The first third of this film was fascinating, with great clips of Hank Williams, Odetta and Woody Guthrie as well as some great stories about Dylan's very early years. Unfortunately, the film doesn't go past the middle 60's. In fact, there is far more general documentary of the 60's than there is of Dylan or his music. This film gets bogged down in the 60's and the points that are raised about Dylan in this period could have been made in one third of the screen time. The film doesn't even go through Blonde on Blonde, and says nothing about all of the fascinating turns in Dylan's music that have taken place over the last 35 years. And the film ends by re-stating the \\"great myth of the motorcycle accident\\". If you were hoping, as I was, for a retrospective of  Dylan's long and richly varied musical life, you will be disappointed by this film. And I have to say that I feel the films of the period (such as \\"don't look back\\") paint a far more vivid look at the young Dylan of the mid-60's. If you are interested in Dylan's music, go to the recorded legacy. There are also some good bio's out, notably \\"Behind the shades\\", which exhaustively discusses all periods of Dylan's music until the publishing date(late 80's or early 90's.) I feel that the most interesting questions that one might ask of an artist like Dylan would concern his current musical interests and his working band. And I feel that this director indulged himself in making yet another tedious montage of the 60's. You can find far more interesting films on that subject.
0060872675|4.0|Sam Vimes, commander of the Ankh-Morpork city Watch, has to be home at 6pm sharp every day to read 'Where's My Cow' to Young Sam.  He's very good at doing the animal noises \\"Where's My cow?  Is that my cow?  It goes 'Oink, oink' It is a pig!  That's not my cow!\\"  Then Vimes gets to thinking that Young Sam is growing up in a city, and will only see these animals on a plate, where they go sizzle!. <br /> <br />So he tries a different version, \\"Where's my daddy?  Is that my daddy?  It goes \\"Bugrit! Millenium Hand and Shrimp'  It is Foul Ole Ron.  That's not my Daddy!\\"  and so on, with a cast of familiar Ankh-Morpork characters, right up to the Patrician.  Until Lady Sybil comes in and Vimes quickly returns to the original text. <br /> <br />This book is amusingly illustrated by Melvyn Grant, who I think has captured the Discworld characters very well.  A very short book, but it should entertain all Discworld fans, and their children too.

B0000BYM3K|3.0|This is easily Maiden's weakest effort since the Bailey days. The songs are muddled, and are all over the place. there is no continuity on this album, unlike on albums like Powerslave and Piece of Mind. Better than most of these new bands out now, but still not up to their previous levels.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not a sci-fi fan, per se, but my wife got me hooked on Firefly since the re-running of the series began on the Sci-Fi Channel. The best thing about this show is the producers put the characters (all human, a big plus), plot and a sense of humor way ahead of the sci-fi aspect of the story. In doing so, the sci-fi elements are much more realistic and believable. You might call it low-tech sci fi. Whatever you call it, it works. <br />Possibly,if the feature film, Serenity, does well, a smart network exec will get this show back in production.

B00005MCX2|5.0|I have been a HawkFan since the acid daze of the early 70's and I highly recommend this album (and most others) by Hawkwind!  They are unique and not widely known in the U.S. although they have an almost cult following around the world.  Their \\"Live\\" perforances are legendary (which is why I chose to review this album).  The British fantasy/sci-fi author Michael Moorcock is a huge fan and has collaborated on some Hawkwind lyrics from time to time.  The band members change often (Dave Brock being the only constant) and that is part of their mystique.  If you like Heavy Metal/Space Rock you will Love Hawkwind and \\"Space Ritual\\"!
0345440757|5.0|While I don't agree with everything that Tracy Hogg has to say (as a parent, there will never be a book that perfectly matches anyone), I like her practical approach. I read this while pregnant with my third child, and my previous experience gave me a good understanding of Tracy's advice. If I had read this the first time around, I probably would have been a little shocked by some things that seemingly fly in the face of current trends in parenting. I notice that other readers have been. But having already been a parent before, Tracy seemed like a breath of fresh air by actually stating truths that only come from \\"having been there\\". Also, I was able to gain some new insights and ideas that I plan to try with my next child. I recommend this book for both new and experienced parents.

B0002DB50E|4.0|I recently got a chance to see Canadian director David Cronenberg's recent feature A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, and even though I think that movie has been a tad overrated by critics---its insights into violence and human nature don't really go much further than \\"even normal people have a capacity for savage violence\\" and \\"violence may be justified in certain situations,\\" ideas which have been essayed in other, better films (Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN is one that pops into mind)---I found Cronenberg's direction interesting. He's like a scientist observing human nature---human nature engaging in some pretty weird stuff. His objective style---which almost reminds me of Eastwood's approach as a director, although Cronenberg doesn't make such a show of his simplicity as Eastwood sometimes does---was the closest A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE came to real subversion, because it made the sudden bursts of (graphic) violence disturbing, and it never glamorized it. (UNFORGIVEN didn't either, which is why I thought of Eastwood's 1992 anti-Western.) Even in the film's finale---in which screenwriter Josh Olson seemed to have lost his nerve and gone for a predictable final showdown---Cronenberg simply looked on with an implicitly questioning eye as we watched one of the characters engage in acts of violence that might have doted on with heroic slo-mos by a hack action director like Michael Bay or Renny Harlin. Thus the film did end on a less-than-exhilarating note (to its credit, I suppose). <br /> <br />At the very least, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE made me interested in some of Cronenberg's earlier films, and VIDEODROME is one of the first I saw after seeing VIOLENCE. The subject matter and the imagery of VIDEODROME is, of course, edgier and more taboo-flouting than in VIOLENCE---but there's Cronenberg's style again, seeming to passively record the \\"adventures\\" of Max Renn (James Woods), a sleazy TV producer who discovers Videodrome, a TV torture show that starts to have an effect on Renn. <br /><br />I won't spoil any of the film's plot developments, but I will comment on what it all means. You know the common question about whether watching violence on TV makes you become violent? In its own way, I think that's the question VIDEODROME is provoking with its disturbing imagery. That, and the character of Max Renn is perhaps a chilling harbinger of the kind of TV (or even film) exec that exists today, frequently trying to pander to mass tastes with the programming they put on the air, without really thinking about whether it's really all that good for the audience or not. (I would dare say that VIDEODROME is almost as prophetic as NETWORK was about television in 1976.) <br /> <br />Are they any faults to this movie? Well, perhaps Cronenberg---who also wrote the screenplay---slightly overdoes the gore and shock effects towards the end of the movie. (The same problem afflicts his 1986 hit THE FLY.) And perhaps one could find Cronenberg's apparent distance from the material---that \\"objective\\" style I was talking about earlier---to be a liability in VIDEODROME: it  could make for a rather cold, unpleasant experience for certain squeamish viewers. <br /> <br />It's a close-run thing, but, in the end, I found VIDEODROME to be a fascinating experience. Hey, I think it's a, I guess, \\"pleasure\\" to watch a sci-fi/horror film that isn't merely gratuitous gore effects and thin characters. Okay, VIDEODROME may not necessarily be the strongest in the characterizations department, but it's about much more than empty shock. Oh, and James Woods is da man! Recommended.

B0009S2T0M|4.0|Park Chanwook's OLDBOY is a powerful movie, but I can't recommend it without some qualifications.    OLDBOY is ostensibly a revenge tale, but, as our main character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), closes in on the man who imprisoned him for 15 straight years, it turns into something a little deeper than its flashy Tarantino-esque style in its first hour may indicate: it turns into an almost poetic drama about the human cost of revenge. When you see our hero humiliated at the end, you won't think that revenge is sweet any longer. (Tarantino made an attempt at this at the end of KILL BILL, VOL. 2, but then Tarantino is perhaps too infatuated with obscure old movies to really be able to convincingly pull off such a humanistic gesture with the conviction Park shows in OLDBOY.)    Revenge movies have always been somewhat morally problematic, especially in modern movies. It's become an action cliche that when someone close to a hero dies, the hero may show a flash of pain on his face, but then he'll collect himself, stand up, and go after his nemesis with even greater force. Obviously, it's an understandable impulse, revenge---but, as even Shakespeare tried to show in HAMLET, it's rarely as simple as that. My memory of HAMLET is a bit faulty, to be honest, but I remember that none of the characters were painted in broad strokes of black or white, and that Hamlet's quest for revenge had an effect on the people around him (especially his sister Ophelia). And of course there's Hamlet himself: thirsty for revenge, but always over-thinking his every move, perhaps too passive a character to ever carry out such a thing.    OLDBOY is far from HAMLET, of course. But, in its own gritty way, its view of revenge---as an inhumanly vicious cycle---is similar. It may not have the nuances of Shakespeare, but it has a poetic intensity at the end of it that can only be described as \\"powerful.\\"    This could have been a great film, though, if Park didn't at times seem so eager to shock for the sake of shock. I mean, seriously (and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler): did we really need the whole incest thing thrown in? And, of course, the violence is occasionally graphic, and filmed in a way that may lead some people to dismiss Park as un-serious in his mostly-pessimistic view of vengeance. There is one scene that is problematic in this regard: one in which Oh takes on a whole bunch of cronies wielding a hammer. Most of the fight is filmed in one long take, and it is probably a scene that wouldn't feel too much out of place in Tarantino's KILL BILL, VOL. 1 (you know, the more violent installment, heh). For a director who makes a big show of decrying the inhumanity of revenge, he does make some of the violence look awfully cool.    But that's not being totally fair to Park, I don't think. Yeah, there are problems in OLDBOY, aspects in which Park's shock tactics go a little too far. Overall, though, I think this is one violent film that doesn't take the pain out of violence, both physical and emotional. You're not hyped up to cheer the revenger here; Oh Dae-su is a sympathetic but not necessarily likable hero (and the actor, Choi Min-sik, doesn't really attempt to make him likable, either). I mean, does he really have to rip the teeth out of a bad guy, like he does in one particularly gory scene? Park's point is that revenge has taken over Oh's life in such a way that it has made him less of a human being. Better this than the stupid (if technically well-made) action revenge sagas that Hollywood has occasionally produced in recent years. Recommended, with reservations.

B000002H97|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE 90'S. WHAT AN ALBUM. THIS ALBUM INTRODUCED METALLICA TO THE 90'S AND IT WAS THERE BRIDGE TO BREAK PAST THE 80'S SCENE.
B000AJJNPY|2.0|I have to stop myself from reviewing Sigur Ros albums as soon as I get them, otherwise they would get inordinately high reviews.  Sigur Ros makes wonderful surface music, laying on the sentimental reverb cheese in such thick layers that its impossible not to be somewhat affected.  But, with this they make startingly obvious music.  It is all major chord progressions we've all heard in elementary school plays, tinkled on the piano.  Sigur Ros isn't happy with just that, they give you bombastic drums, and 20 guitar tracks of pretty murk turned up to 11, all sorts of delicate instrumentation like xylophones and glockinspiel, AND an angelic voice singing sweet nothings.  Occasionally they even let out some distorted distorted heavy guitar bangs to bring this all to a boil.  It is all so very rousing and beautiful and amazing for the first 20 listens, then the surprise is gone, and so is the effect.  It isn't music anymore, but empty sentimental drivel.  I don't know why it always makes that transition.  But with everyone of their albums, it always has the same trajectory.  OH MY GOD.  I LOVE IT.  Its cool on dreary days driving home from work.  I'm over it.  Eh.
B000002HRE|4.0|THIS ALBUM ISN'T AS GOOD AS LOAD BUT IT IS STILL GOOD. PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN THAT METALLICA HAS CHANGED TOO MUCH GIVE ME A BREAK. THEY HAVE TO CHANGE BECAUSE THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

B0002XDODU|3.0|I love Rammstein.... I wanted to love this album... I just dont.  I think they have been slowly leaking air since Herzeleid (which I think remains their sonic masterpiece) and this represents the album where you notice the tire is going flat.  Sehnsucht and Mutter both had some incredible singles... but to me, they both had their filler songs.  Reise Reise, to me is 90% filler... none of the songs truly grab me... and some are just plain corny... Amerika and Moskow... for example.  One of my big tests is this.  I tend to make compilation CDs of my favorite bands so I can just listen to my favorite songs.  A CD only holds so much space.  The test of a new album is how many songs are so good you have to revisit your compilation and find songs to take off of it to get the new gems on it.  Well, with Reise Reise, there is not even one song where I would kick out any of my previous top 20 Rammstein songs to include some from this album.  Even the singles werent very inspiring... they were just merely ok.  Then so much of what was done seemed so derivative of other songs on this same album.<br /><br />To me, the album lacks in aggression as well.  Rather than blistering guitarwork and nice classic heavy guitar tone... we get alot of songs based on more acoustic style rhythm parts.  Fine... good change of pace for ONE song... but too much of the album seemed structured this way.  That combined with that I do not feel the songs are particularly catchy or melodic (which was usually a Rammstein halmark along with the heaviness) leaves this whole album flat for me.  It is still good... if you have all the others, by all means grab this one too... but, if you are starting out on Rammstein, go back to the beginning... go in order... this band is brilliant.  You have to wonder with the new album Rosenrott coming out only a year after Reise Reise if that isnt a bit of an admission on their part that they realize Reise Reise really just wasnt very good.... definitely below their capabilities.r capabilities.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Green Day. One of the first commerical punk rock bands next to The Offspring to make a breakthrough to the radio waves during the early 90's. Green Day has always been praised as a pretty straightfoward punk rock band with simple powerchords and pounding drums powered foward by Billie Joe's vocals. Green Day has never been a political or angry band up until this point on their later release, American Idiot.<br /><br />Green Day's latest release is a lot more poppy than Nimrod, Warning, Dookie, and all their other releases. However, many fans think that many times it is cool to hate bands that immitate everyone else and become popular. Green Day has always been a band that everyone look towards as great punk band. And just because Billie Joe wears eyeliner and looks a little more \\"scary/industrial\\" they are still Green Day. The creators of modern-day punk music.<br /><br />Overall American Idiot is a change in a new direction for Green Day. The album is still solid and is different from their previous releases. I think that Green Day is still great live and have great albums to back up the so called failure by some \\"American Idiot\\".
B00004U8H4|5.0|Not as good as the book but a far cry from most of the poorly written crap that makes it to the cinema or DVD for that matter. Not for everyones taste (definately not for the meek) Scathingly funny! and expertly directed a must own.
0375405380|1.0|Don Winslow, identify yourself, cause this trash certainly wasn't written by the same person who wrote, \\"California Fire and Life.\\"  A well writen and well crafted story that hooked the reader on every page is followed by this disjointed unreadable tale in which every one is an orphan, everyone has a tale to tell and the protanganist is so flawed that the reader is hoping, no praying that he will get killed and put and end to our misery.  My congratulations to any masocist that managed to read this entire book, I managed a few hundred pages, started skipping ahead and quickly saw that it never improved.   <br />Don, whoever you are, whereever you are, come back and write another novel like, CF&L. Until then give up on this crusade or whatever it is regarding the Vietnam war and the drug war, it just ain't interesting.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is so melodic. The harmony is beautiful. The Red Hot Chili Peppers know what music is. <br /> <br />But WHY does everyone diss on the song 'Universally Speaking'? It's one of my top three on the album, the other two being 'The Zephyr Song' and 'Tear'.

B000BBOUU4|5.0|Does anyone remember \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?\\"  Well, throw that one away.  \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is taking it's place as the movie Dahl invisioned.<br /><br />I don't need to give a summary of the story, as everyone knows what it is.  What I need to do, first, is dispell some isues.<br /><br />Where is the music?<br /><br />Why, it's there.  The Oompa Loompas sing, only they have much, much better songs.<br /><br />What about Charlie and his Grandfather drinking the bubble stuff?<br /><br />That actually did not happen in the book.<br /><br />What about the whole Everlasting Gobstopper thing, with Charlie giving his back?<br /><br />Again, not in the book.  The book was about the importance of family, not the importance of sharing.  And that is where the original movie went horribly wrong.  This newer version brings out the moral as Dahl wanted it.<br /><br />Depp, as usual, gives an incredible performance, and Burton shows off his as usual incredible directing skills.<br /><br />This Wonka was much more believable around the kids as he hadn't been around people for years.  His antics and his needing the cards made much more sense.  And the fact that he was weird only made it funnier.  His whole backstory was incredible, as well as sad.  The whole issue with his father and the scene where he and his father meet back up is very touching.  Depp did incredible with the character.  His adaption worked given how Wonka was supposed to be, and it made more sense.<br /><br />I though it was very touching that Wonka's father had been following his son's career, even though he claimed to not be there when Wonka came back.  It was very moving, to say the least.<br /><br />I liked this Charlie much better.  He was way more realistic, as was the Grandfather.  I loved the Grandfather.  He was incredible and funny.  And I liked the idea that Charlie's Grandfather used to work for Mr. Wonka.  That was awesome.<br /><br />This is an incredible movie, and is the only real book-screen adaptation of Raold Dahl's original work.  Gene Wilder's version is now inconsequential.

Someone made sense out of the guitar at last!
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|This is a must have for any Buddy Guy Fan. Buddy raises the bar with this new cd by having duets with such big artists as John Mayer, Tracy Chapman, and Carlos Santana.

This record is totally amazing and will blow your mind. and yes, if you are just becoming accustomed to punk, you must check out Rancid's predecessors, but let's not assume everyone here is an ignorant pop music fan who accidentally stumbled into Rancid on accident and never bothered to discover the rest of the genre!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|What is so incredible about this sort lived series, 14 episodes in all, is that it accomplishes more with half a season than most shows develop in six seasons. The characters and performers playing them are all top notch, the stories in each episode are extremely funny, profound, deeply moving and exciting from beginning to end. If you love Sci-Fi, you'll love this, but even if you don't, that's okay because despite this taking place in space and on other planets, the emphasis is on characters, emotion and a feeling of family. Truly one of the great television series of our time.<br /><br />The dvd comes with fun commentaries, a revealing retrospective documentary and a few other fun featurettes. Plus, with the movie, Serenity coming out today, I feel this could very well be the beginning of a wonderful new series, regardless of format.
B000A88F22|2.0|This show is absolutely horrible. It's called \\"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\\" yet it seems to be all Britney for the most part. Yeah, they're in love it seems which is good, but Britney? Honestly? The girl can't film right, she moves the camera around too much and she sounds like a drunken Girls Gone Wild with her jokes about favorite sexual positions. The show is too dark for me as well. Does Kevin sit and talk to the camera at all like Britney has in her own little \\"Real World Confessions\\" type thing? No, I didn't think so.

B0000074BS|5.0|This isn't _Spirit Of Eden_ or _Laughing Stock_ in terms of quality or experimentalism (which, by the way, are two albums that are absolutely essential to any music collection). But the songs on here are just _really good_! Semi-experimental synth-pop (save for a couple of more organic-sounding tracks that really foreshadow the direction the group was about to take) with relatively varied instrumentation and song structures. And Mark Hollis' wonderful voice! Recommended.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Enjoyed the movies again after all these years. I think that this is a feel good film set to watch with your child, especially one that has faced bullies. There isn't maybe a karate championship in most kids futures, but it opens the door to talking about being a new kid or a kid that is the target of bullies. Also, it is a sweet, happy ending film that gives a glimpse of Japan and you can watch it without worry as it is family friendly.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|What more can I say about this movie than the title of my review?<br /><br />FORGET THE ORIGINAL. This version is one that I'm sure Roald Dahl would be proud of. And FORGET all the stupid people who are saying that Johnny Depp is just like Michael Jackson in this film, because it is just NOT TRUE.<br /><br />Depp is an absolutely fabulous actor, with more talent than he can cope with. His portrayal of the wacky Willy Wonka (alliteration rules!) is perfect. And though he is known to look a little strange in this film, it just accentuates how good-looking he is. So no more Jacko comparisons please....<br /><br />Freddy Highmore I would say is not an extremely good Charlie Bucket, as I found his performance a little wooden. However, this is side-lined by the other performances. Depp's is obviously the stand-out one, with every line delivered with perfection, and each line basically a fantastically funny one-liner. But Violet Beauregarde is extremely enjoyable to watch, with her over-competitiveness and hard-core attitude. Veruca Salt is as rude, snobbish and bossy as she is supposed to be, and Agustus Gloop is amusing to watch (who would have known it would be a German boy to play him? ^_^) The movie in itself is extremely funny to watch; I laughed both times that I went to see it!<br /><br />And the Oompa Loompa's are fantastic, accompanied by the wonderous song arrangements by Danny Elfman, one of the best movie soundtrack composers ever to walk this earth (see \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"The Simpsons\\" theme tune fore proof).<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of the best children's movies you could EVER watch, and should be bought as soon as possible.
B0007XT87G|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  This is great music (not as awesome as the foaming rabid fans would have you beleive, but great music none the less).  However, I picked up this CD based on the hype (haven't heard anything by PT before) and was dissapointed the first time I ran it through.  I thought I was purchasing a Progressive Band with Metal Rock styling; something like Dream Theater.  Instead I got a Hard Rock band with a touch of Neo-Progressive music. <br /> <br />Having said that, some three days later I can say the music has definetly grown on me.  The guiter soloing is reminiscent of Alan Holdworth meeting Robert Fripp.  Good stuff.  The hooks are as catchy as Judas Priest (NOT the style of music but having the same groove quality).  The moodiness is like Pink Floyd.  Great music but a little too much electronic \\"doodleing\\" in between; I thing PT was struck down in their youth by a UFO. <br /> <br />If you are a Prog or Neo Prog fan, this is not it.  But I think the music does speak for itself in whatever catagory you place it in. <br /> <br /> <br />
0790731002|5.0|Okay okay,. everyone agrees that Tim Burton is the master of the Gothic, when it comes to films. Just look at some of the films he has done and that's proof enough. And everyone knows that Joel Schumacher isn't, plain and simple, neither does he have the impressive back-catalogue that Sir Burton has. (the only other film I have viewed by Schumacher is \\"The Lost Boys\\", which is actually a very good film. But it was the 80s, come on.)<br /><br />However, that does not deter this film from being a fantastic one. I like the way he mouled Gotham into a really cool, bright-coloured and still dark and gothic city, with amazing glowing clothes and buildings. It seems like a real party city, one you'd definitely want to swing by.<br /><br />In my opinion, Val Kilmer is a far better Batman than Micheal Keaton. To be Batman, you have to have the Bruce Wayne lips, as they are the only things you can really see with the mask on. And sure, Micheal Keaton had those. But take the mask off, and he just wasn't CONVINCING as Bruce Wayne. Not at all. However, Val Kilmer portrays Bruce Wayne perfectly; smooth and suave, and gorgeously serious. And then, as he steps into the suit, he is instantly the strong, tough Batman that we know and love. George Clooney was horrifying in this role, and I haven't yet seen Christian Bale's performance, but Val Kilmer is the winner, hands-down.<br /><br />The two bad guys in this outing are Two-Face (played by a demented Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (played by an absolutely amazingly freaky Jim Carrey). It is extremely unusual seeing Tommy Lee Jones in a role like this. I have no idea why he took it, but I'm glad he did, as he shows Harvey Dent's split-personality monster man with a certain flair. Plus he looks fantastic in that costume.<br /><br />But Jim Carrey. Just wow. He is the most entertaining baddie I have ever seen in any movie, and that is a fact. His portrayal of Edward Nygma and his alter-ego is so hilariously silly and disturbing all at the same time, you sometimes wonder if he could possibly be two different people in the one body! He is an absolute joy to watch.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman is suitably sexy as Chase Meridian, and does a good job as the girl. There's is nothing oustanding about her performance, but she is enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />And Chris O'Donnell is extremely likeable in his role as the young cheeky orphan Dick Grayson, who becomes Robin, Batman's side-kick. The circus scene is one of the most dramatic and tragic scenes in the film, and is amazing to watch.<br /><br />Plus, the songs in the credits are absolutely AMAZING. Two of my favourite songs of all-time now, \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\" by U2 and \\"Kiss From A Rose\\" by Seal are two gorgeously authentic songs. Amazing.<br /><br />This film is absolutely fantastic. I seriously recommend it, it is in my opinion the best one.ou sometimes wonder if he could possibly be two different people in the one body!

B000BKJ78K|1.0|Well, I must say that this is a pointless release. These aren't the older orginials, this is the same as the extremely good looking and sounding 2004 DVD box set minus the extras disc(which are totally different from the 1997 special editions, the 2004 versions have been fixed effectswise and storywise.) The lightsaber glitches HAVE been corrected, but I wish that Lucas wouldn't have said on the preview before the presentation on the final release of the orginial theatrical versions of these films \\"Get these today- for the last time.\\" I really hoped they wouldn't have said this....
0156907399|4.0|To The Lighthouse (and Woolf in general) is probably not going to be satisfying for a reader looking for a page-turning, pulse-pounding escape from sleep.  For those interested in literary history, or more particularly, the emergence of Modernism, this book is a great place to start.   <br /> <br />   The prose is lyrical, provocative, but dense.   You might take a look at the plot summary on Sparknotes to check your interest level.  Do you enjoy long depictions of dinner parties and inner monologue?  If not, I would skip this.  If you're not sure, the first chapter will either pull you right in or kick you right out.   <br /> <br />   To The Lighthouse is not easy.  I found it impossible to concentrate on it with any background noise, hunger...or anything else on my mind.  If you decide to try it, give yourself a chance to enjoy it.  Don't skim, don't read for less than 30 minutes at a time, and try to read every day until you're done.  It's hard to pick back up if you slack.   <br />   <br />   I found TTLH to be a thoughtful, beautifully written book.  It was slow going, though, and I don't know if I'll ever need to read it again, hence 4 stars.
0316172324|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It really makes you think about snap decision making, how we all do it, how some people are more adept at it, and how to become better at it.  It's a really enjoyable read.
B000AL730O|2.0|First, McCartney is such a giant that any new music from him should be welcomed. If you think of any of the great composers of popular music in the last one hundred years (Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Bacharach, Irving Berlin, etc.), none of them did much good work in their sixties. They all hit their stride in their twenties, thirties, and forties. I am happy that McCartney is still having a go at it. That being said, this is a weak album. It is totally forgettable. I have to wonder if he worked at these melodies - they have the appearance of being lazy and show little effort. Gone are the days when he did take after take or let a song percolate in his memory for months before committing it to the recording studio. Paul is a good family man, a genius of popular music, a great rocker. His best creative work appears to be behind him. Nothing wrong with that. He can perform his back catalogue for years and we will love him for it.
6301304942|5.0|This is a fine cinema version of an Australian stage production of Tosca. The singing, orchestra, acting, and stage settings are all wonderful, and I've never seen or heard a better Scarpia. If Puccini were alive today, I'm sure he would be cranking out a lot of great popular musicals.
0393035158|5.0|I like this book a lot. I think I should first give all the reasons I like it.     1. There has never been a book like this. It is one of the most original I have come across. I don't believe anyone has ever written a book attacking monotheism before that wasn't written from an apologetic point of view. If I had to compare it to something, it would be \\"Why I am not a Christian\\" by Bertrand Russell, or even \\"Meditations\\" by Descartes.  The book is extremely well ordered. You can't tell this from the table of contents because the chapter titles are poetic, but it can be broken down as follows with his titles in parenthesis.     Chapter 1. Political position regarding monotheism (Reason in Exile)  Chapter 2. Philosophical position (The Nature of Belief)  Chapter 3. Problematic of Christian History (In the Shadow of God)  Chapter 4. (The Problem with Islam)  Chapter 5. Christianity and U.S. Politics (West of Eden)  Chapter 6. Ethics (A Science of Good and Evil)  Chapter 7. Mysticism (Experiments in Consciousness)    Harris avoids the kind of Christian discourse known as Apologetics, preferring to get right down to the truth about what religions claim and what that means to the rest of us in light of the dictums of the books cited as infallible by their adherents, especially the Bible and the Koran. Philosophically, the focus of his attack is on religious moderates and the idea that Religions are actually good, and ultimately even help us get along together. It is this focus that makes this book immortal in my estimation. It will be on \\"Need to Read\\" lists for many years.    Besides being enchanted with the freshness, intelligence and originality of the book, let me mention a couple of omissions which I consider significant. First, there is no discussion of life and death, or a philosophy of life and death. This will have to come from other sources. Since this book is meant to be primarily a wake-up call to atheists, I guess he didn't feel that it was necessary. I'm nottalking about proselytization, which this book isn't, anyone shedding the religion of their ancestors will need to confront this question, and a little help may not hurt.     Second, he goes light on Judaism. Whether this is due to \\"Holocaust Guilt\\" or with being too close to his own background, it does not coincide with the facts. In my own analysis of religion it has been quite clear that the moral turpitude so obvious in the Christian churches (and the reasons why the Christian ideas gained hegemony in Rome so easily, for example) cuts deep into Jewish history and culture as well, and it seems strange that Judaism has been so completely spared by his knife as to be almost beyond mentioning.     The second strangeness is his call for a science of mysticism. He's not concerned with New Age mysticism in general as one reader has claimed, he's interested in Tibetan Buddhism, which he feels is the best popular exposition available on \\"Scientific\\" Phenomenology. I admit that this idea is not foreign to me. I've often thought of low Buddhism and Zen Buddhism as enlightened philosophies that get to the point a lot faster than most western philosophers, while avoiding dogma. So I naturally feel very comfortable for his call to explore alternatives to religion, what he calls \\"Scientific Mysticism\\".      Thirdly, after criticizing the Torquemada with all the appropriate harshness you would expect, he goes on to present an argument for reviving torture in order to deal with the contingency of Terroristic Religion. His justification comes from \\"Collateral Damage\\", how you would weigh the destructiveness of torturing an innocent person against the destruction caused by firebombing a city, for example. This reasoning is not easy to agree with.    Finally, with Samuel Huntington, he is against Islamic Civilization. He buys Huntington's whole argument and sincerely believes we are locked in a fight to the death with Islamicists and the \\"Islamic Civilization\\" that nutures them. How this is any any different from an Islamic person viewing Western soldiers as Crusaders nurtured by our \\"Christian\\" civilization somehow escapes me. In what way is this any different from the \\"fight to the death\\" we just completed with \\"Godless Communism\\"? To some of us, it seems a little too convenient that the weapons ovens are now blazing up again just after the Cold War is finally over.    His attacks on Relativism and modern Pragmaticism in Chapter 6 are very well reasoned. Personally, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he calls himself a \\"Realist\\", since this is how I present myself.       So all of this isn't for everyone, and some of this is for someone, etc. Each will have something to dislike, but it will be very hard to find a book as spiritually uplifting as this, which also has been banned at church.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|When my fisrt Canon battery expired...after a long use, I purchased a knock-off. What a mistake. It lasted about 1/3 as long as the Canon, and, of course, it died at just the wrong time, during a wedding. I went back to a Canon product and \\"it just keeps on ticking\\". It cost a little more but the security and longevity are well worth it

B00008DDRX|5.0|If you're a race fan this is the best racing movie ever made.  The action is great and isn't overwhelmed by the \\"love\\" story.
B00079FUI6|1.0|This is junk tv for the type of women who see the world through a lens of Cosmopolitan magazine and high-end mall consumer culture. While marketed as fresh and contemporary, the women in this series are actually a throwback to the ditzes of the old fifties tv sit-coms - with one glaring difference: the fifties women (Lucy, Gracie Allen, Eve Arden) were talented comediennes. The Desperate Housewives are talented at nothing but the ability to schedule more plastic surgery with their doctors. No one works, no one has any intellectual, cultural, political interests, everyone lives in a fantasy world suburbia where everyone is cosmetically perfect, etc. Think of this as the disaster that would happen if Oprah produced a \\"comedy\\" show - in other words, a lame, mindless, estrogen drenched, unrealistic, annoyingly \\"huggy, touchy-feely\\" show that would fit very comfortably in a women's magazine and can be happily viewed while swallowing mega-doses of Paxil and appetite-suppressants. BTW, the men are all portrayed as insensitive dolts who, inexplicably,  put up with these complaining, never satisfied, self-absorbed, moody, sex obsessed bimbos. Real men tell these type of women to flip off and real men are too smart to marry these type of women.
0393317552|3.0|For those people who know little about human history, or have been taught that the rise of the West is due to some innate superiority, I suppose this book could be enlightening. But for everyone else, Guns, Germs, and Steel presents nothing new, original, or controversial, except for Diamond's claim that aboriginal New Guineans are superior to Western peoples - this slip might be understandable given Diamond's long-term study and fondness for these people. This book could easily have been edited down by a third and it would have been better for it. Otherwise, it is a decent primer on human history, but how and why it won the Pulitzer is beyond me.
B00009MGGI|5.0|One of the best cast movies.  Everyone was perfect for their part.  Machiavellian plot keeps you enthralled to the very end. <br />Also, very insightful into the British political system.  We have purchased it as a gift for several friends who enjoy political intrigue.  It is anti-conservative government but we found that not to affect our enjoyment of the splendid acting and twisting plot.
0380002930|5.0|The first time I read Watership Down, I was around eleven or twelve. I had seen the movie a couple of years before (during its first theatrical release, to give you an idea of how long it has been) and when I had the chance, I got the book. I still read it every few years, most recently this summer, and I never regret the time I spend on it. The character development is magnificent. Of course, the rabbits have to be human-like to carry the story, but the author keeps enough of their animal traits to be convincing. They are rabbits, not people in fur coats. I know some young readers find the book hard and long. I felt that way the first time. I hope you will try it again in a few years; you might find you understand and enjoy a lot more of the book the second time around. <br /> <br />The reviews I have read here tend to focus on the allegorical aspects of the book: the rabbits represent people, struggling with issues in our society; their concerns represent Cold War anxieties; and so on. This is all true, but I find the book more interesting for the insight it provides into the environmentalism and animal-rights activism of the 1960s and 1970s. Both trends resurface in the other Adams books I have read (of which I think Plague Dogs is the best, but it is so graphic and heartbreaking I would not recommend it to most people). Back in the 1950s, people were sometimes showered with fallout from aboveground nuclear testing. Imagine living in a culture with that level of disregard for the world around it, and you will begin to appreciate why humans are so scary in Watership Down.

B00003CXCW|5.0|Being a long time fan of this extraordinary film, along with others made by Billy Wilder, I was anxious to get it in a DVD format. The film is pristine and the extras are simply wonderful. It's amazing to pay so very little for this DVD at Amazon and get all the extra features along with a wonderful vintage film! I have purchased many DVDs at Amazon, including boxed sets, and I am always very pleased.
B000089J0R|5.0|This album rocks like few others i have ever heard.  Imagine Van Halen's song \\"Eruption\\" for 40 mintues while Dio suddenly gains the vocal talent of Chris Cornell and wails out over the solos.  Pure metal sweetness.
0553275976|4.0|When I first read this book, I didn't like it. It did grow on me and in retrospect I saw it was some of the best satire done in decades. But I think the actual book itself is so heavy and so full of genuinely mercenary and dishonorable people that it makes you want to hold it at arm's length. This is a tough read, and it dwells in themes that by nature are not pleasant. What it DOES achieve is an ultra-realistic (and growing moreso by the year) illustration of how society really works.
B000000WFF|5.0|I played Spiceworld far more than their other two.  This album had some very sharp pop songs and was far more diverse. It was the soundtrack to their box-office flop Spice World, but it stands more on its own away from the movie.  The songs have a positive feel to them, especially the optimistic Do It and Spice Up Your Life. They express their familiar girl power themes all throughout the album. But the girls have a tough side to them in no-nonsense songs like Stop and Denying.  Saturday Night comes very close to some of Puff Daddy's hip-hop grooves with its funky beats.  I definitely like the Latin hard-hitting percussion grooves in Spice Up Your Life, which races so fast at 100 miles per hour in its 2:53 length!  You want to believe it, hear the song yourself.  And Too Much is a better ballad for them than 2 Become 1 on their debut.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard the high keyboards, bass and catchy grooves of Denying. I may have heard it 20 to 30 times, because it's such perfect pop stuff.  It sounds a little like Say You'll Be There, but it's entirely different.  The last song, The Lady Is A Vamp, shows their dedication and tribute to past divas before them. It has that '40s feel to it with its cabaret meets Vegas sound.  This was their most entertaining and creative album and I still love it!
B00005JNDZ|4.0|It was funny, hilarious and deeply understandable. As of Bidget's age, all can be happened but like Mark....too much expectation for single woman.   Get real!!!
0679746048|5.0|I saw the movie first and absolutely loved it.  It made me want to go hang out at the local psychaitric facility.  When I found out it was based on a book, I knew immediately it was a must read.  And it was amazing.  Not what I was expecting, at all.  I went into it expecting a novel and memoir, what I got was much more real.  And much more true to what I imagined life at a mental institution would be like.  While I loved the movie, I accepted that it was an idealized, false representation.  But, nevertheless, the movie was great.  The book was even greater.  That is, if you can handle reality.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Great music - great sound - can't wait to see the NYC shows. <br />Buy this DVD !! <br /> <br />Yeah - it would have been better releasing all 4 shows but we never get what we want from the music companies ! Enjoy what we get !
B00005AREQ|5.0|This special album has survived the test of time and mainly for four songs: Scatterbrain, Cause We've Survived As Lovers, Freeway Jam, and Diamond Dust.      These are among his best and provide Beck with the framework to be the next \\"king of fusion guitar\\" after John McLaughlin.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I enjoyed Fahrenheit 9/11 by ~ Michael Moore (II) mainly because it portrays todays reality much to my sorrow. I think every adult American should see it for the good of our nation. <br />It's an eye opener to truth.
0736041850|5.0|This book shows clearly what muscles are exercised by each training movement. It is accurate, very detailed and very easy to use. The chapters are divided into muscle groups: arms, chest etc.. and all the best known training movements are covered along with variations and how these isolate a particular muscle. I have been using this book for just a month and whereas previously I was only familiar with where three or four muscle groups were and what general movements exercised them, I am now able to train, for instance, isolated heads of a particular muscle. The illustrations are clear and the book opens with a full body muscle map. Overall, an excellent book for anyone working out.
0805076476|3.0|Yes, I'm going to say it ... the movie was better than the book.  I know, I know.  The ultimate sacriledge for any book lover.  But, c'mon.  Seriously.  It was a decent book, I won't deny that.  It kept me entertained, it kept me reading, but in comparison to the movie - eh.  I honestly believe that the only reason this book became so well-known and so huge is simply because of the movie.  And all those kids out there dying to belong, read it and accepted it ... despite it's many flaws.  Despite it being a pop-culture novel.  Sad truth is - they don't really know any better.  However, I won't completely knock the book down, it was amusing and had some of the best one-liners of all time, but I'll stick to the movie for now.<br /><br />PS - I am in NO WAY knocking Palahniuk ... I'm well aware of his brilliance.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I love horror films but rarely am I truly frightened by one.  This was one of the very rare ones that actually gave me nightmares back in 1981 when I saw it for the first time.  A tour de force of low-budget film making which really shows (for all aspiring filmmakers) that you can make a great film with little money if you have talent.  Sam Raimi has talent.  This tale of five friends who go to stay at a backwoods cabin is truly terrifying.  The cabin is in the middle of nowhere and the cabin itself is a ramshackle mess.<br /><br />The first signs you get of something wrong is when the wooden porch swing moves slightly and then abruptly stops.  The group finds a book (Necronomicon) and tape recorder with a guy doing weird incantations.  Soon Cheryl is guessing the playing cards without seeing them and is promptly possessed by a demonic spirit, taking a pencil and driving it into the ankle of another girl.  They eventually fight her off and lock her in the cellar where she taunts them.  One by one the rest of the friends become possessed except for Ash (Bruce Campbell) and he finds himself fighting off the demons by himself.<br /><br />There are some really creepy scenes such as when Cheryl is sexually assaulted by a tree, and when Ash's girfriend playfully taunts \\"Were gonna get you...We're gonna get you\\"  These are shudder inducing scenes!  The blood flows freely and thick as Ash does everything he can to destroy the demon's human bodies.<br /><br />Raimi's cheap but effective gore, and dis-orienting camera work add to the unsettling feeling of the film.  The actors, while all inexperienced and most doing their first film really do a fantastic job, especially Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl.  Raimi is evidently doing a big budget remake of the film set to come out in the next couple of years.  A fantastic horror film and it still packs a punch.
B00005K9QP|5.0|While Jeff Beck was pioneering hard-edge guitar so was Eric Clapton.      This album unveils perfection of what would become his quintessential style.    \\"What'd I'd say\\" and \\"Key To Love\\" are standouts.    An Amazon ranking consistently around 1000 testifies to the timeless importance of this album.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I thought green day was going to be back on track with this album but ..... i was sooooo  wrong!!!American idiot sounds sooooo similarrrr with all their other records, and they even start making realllly terrible and generic songs like boulevard of broken dreams and that song When Sept Ends is way too cheesy for me. Sept ends Sounds more like a cheesy bon jovi song to me and thats really bad a for a so called \\"punk band\\". The only song I enjoy is holiday which i thought was decent at best. <br /> <br />Conclusion: I am over with green day and they'll probably have a new fan base  of 13-15 year olds.. There r so many better new bands out there today. I suggest u spend your money on other new albums by new bands like arcade fire, franz ferdinand, bloc party, interpol, kaiser chiefs,razorlight, or even u2 who I believe r still king eventhough they made that cheesy ipod commercial!
B000002H97|5.0|Why some Metallica fans dont like this album as much as their earlier stuff is beyond me. The albums before this one are great but so is this one but from the perspective that this record is deeper and I hate to say it but, mainstream. The songs on this cd are very very well thought out and you can really tell that the guys worked hard on this album. . The guitar solos on this cd are awesome, as are the vocals and drums. The guitar solos are much much shorter then they were on the previous c.d.s, which in my opinion is NOT a bad thing. And for those of you who think Metallica sold out on this ablum, your right...they sold out every night.
B000AA302U|5.0|Being a HUGE Jamiroquai fan for years now, and having almost encyclopedic knowledge of all their 5 previous albums, I must say that Dynamite ranks way, way up there if not better than the rest. Some reviews have said that this album follows right along with the style of A Funk Odyssey, but honestly, Dynamite is in a league all its own in some ways. True, there are a few songs on the album like the title track Dynamite, (Don't) Give Hate a Chance, and Electric Mistress that have that kind of \\"dance club\\" vibe to them, but when you explore the whole album, it soon becomes evident that the style of music is as diverse as any previous album ever was. there is the aforementioned \\"club\\" style, along with some more gritty type songs like Feels Just Like It Should and Black Devil Car, and even melodic in Talullah. Seven Days in Sunny June and Hot Tequila Brown are feel good summertime songs that are tough to get out of your head, and Starchild & Time Won't Wait make it hard not to scramble to learn the lyrics so you can sing along at the top of your lungs. There is even a political opinion expressed as World That He Wants is obviously about how our President is not exactly Jay's favorite person (as is also made abuntantly clear in the CD booklet where he concludes his thank yous with a special message for ol' W) But I digress...... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />If you are a longtime hardcore jamiroquai fan, you should love this album, and I highly, highly recommend it, and if you are a fan of well written, jazz/funk/dance you should definitely enjoy this album as well.  <br /> <br />ENJOY!!!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|\\"1) Any band giving competition to Nirvana (Pearl Jam; Guns N Roses; Smashing Pumpkins) were insulted by Kurt Cobain for being \\"corporate\\", yet Nirvana made just as many music videos in their short time span as Nsync did for their first album, and did interviews with anyone, anywhere.. whereas most bands use the competition of other bands to try to make their music better, Kurt took the coward, immature way out and just insulted them to try to hurt their credibility\\"  1. Any band giving competition were given a fair trial. Kurt eventually made up and became friends with Eddie. Slash himself expressed admiration for Kurt Cobain and the feud was mostly with Axl who was a bit of a a$$ anyway. They only released music videos because of their popularity, four from Never Mind and one from In Utero. They made their name through relentless touring and word of mouth before hand.    \\"2) Kurt Cobain had no problem wearing a tshirt that says \\"corporate magazines still suck\\", and he had no problem calling MTV on his own time and telling them to play Nirvanas music videos more either.\\"  2. Maybe you don't realize it, but there's a difference between a  \\"magazine\\" and music television? And even if he did call MTV to play his videos more... He's trying to sell albums. Yes, he picked up a guitar for the music, but when your livelihood is music you want it to do well. To cap it all of his shirt about corporate magazines still sucking was a humorous self reference to his/Nirvana's own appearance in a corporate magazine.    \\"3) Nirvana did not have the whole world obsessed with their music, 'In Utero' sold 5 million copies... Im pretty sure the last Coldplay album sold the same amount. So why today, is he so idolized?\\"  3. Nobody said Nirvana has the world obsessed with their music...? And In Utero for being so abraisive and far removed from popular music sold exceptionally well. He's idolized for expressing the sentiments felt by many teens, Chris Martin is not. (Nothing against Chris, he's put out some decent music)    \\"4) Nirvana were not original. You know nothing about music. They were rip-offs of the Pixies. No excuses. No arguments. They were bigger Pixies wannabes than Puddle of Mudd is to Nirvana.\\"  4. Nirvana had some originality as even the biggest ripoff bands do, which Nirvana was not. They incorporated some elements of the Pixies, sure, but they had more influences than that like Sonic Youth, the Beatles, Black Sabbath, the Melvins, et cetera. They made it their own.    \\"5) Want to know why Nirvana was the first Seattle band to get huge? Because they had the mass marketing machine of David Geffen behind them - Geffen being willing to promote Nirvana to any level... basically the same thing done with Good Charlotte; Avril Lavigne;, anyone.\\"  5. Nirvana was the first Seattle band to become popular because it caught people's attention, that's all. Pearl Jam also had a mass marketing machine in the form of Epic Records, one of the oldest and integral parts of Sony. Likewise Alice in Chain with Columbia Records, and Soundgarden with A&M records. So basically any band that wanted to be heard was on a major label.    \\"6) Some people call Nirvanas music simplistic.. and Nirvana fans respond with 'So what?' - Ok... then let me say it differently.. Nirvans music isnt so much simplistic, as it is often very immature and teen-angst sounding.\\"  6. You're right some people call Nirvana simplistic. And simple music and melody doesn't make it any less effective or endearing. Immature? That's very subjective but I don't think so. They sang about things far from ordinary on the pop radar. Angst filled? Only Nevermind, which was in fact poked fun at by Cobain himself with the line \\"Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old\\". It also doesn't explain how Nirvana's non-angsty records are regarded as classics: See MTV Unplugged in New York.    \\"7) Nirvana were NOT the Beatles of this generation.. the Beatles were original, no one really pavedthe way for the Beatles, the Beatles had no one to copy. no band has been the Beatles of this generation. The Beatles proved themself album after album after album after album. If 'You Know Youre Right' is any indication, Nirvana were going down hill FAST. Nirvana copied tons of bands (not INFLUENCED BY... JUST *COPIED*), tons of bands (guys in PEARL JAM (thats right), Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney, the Melvins, and especially the Pixies all paved the way for Nirvana to be noticed. \\"  7. The Beatles had no one to copy? Rock music must have not exited prior to 1962? The Beatles were enthusiastic followers of Cliff Richards and the Shadows. Chuck Berry was also a huge influence. Most of the Motown and Rock 'N' Roll scene influenced the Beatles, the same way other bands influenced Nirvana. And using a You Know You're Right (a demo song not given proper studio treatment) is a bad indication of where the band was going, even if the song was great. Green River didn't have a profound effect on Nirvana at all, nor Pearl Jam. And yes, other bands paved the way for Nirvana to be noticed, but that's the way with all music.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's OK Computer is a dark, foreboding, sonic masterpiece. The disparity in Thom Yorke's voice is unmistakable, and the music present on this album sends chills down my spine everytime. For me, the standout tracks are \\"Let Down,\\" \\"Paranoid Android,\\" \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\\" and \\"Lucky.\\" This album offers not only insights into our post modern world but also hits the mark completely musically. I have been listening to this album for more than a couple years (I will admit that I have only gotten into Radiohead in the last four years) but each listen results in a rewarding experience for me because of the subtle intricacies in the music. The harmonics in some of the songs are used beautifully. Ok Computer is by far Radiohead's most polished and grandiose album. I recommend it to anyone who likes who likes music with depth, or anyone interested in broadening their musical horizons. If you listen deeply to the MUSIC, not to just Yorke's howling falsetto (I consider his voice to just be another instrument, considering half of what he says upon a first listen is incomprehensible) you will be richly rewarded.
B00006M183|1.0|I can't even listen past the 2nd track. This is 2005, grunge is soooo over.
B000002UR7|5.0|I don't pretend to call myself a Radiohead expert. Yes, I have five of their albums, so you can call me a fan for sure. I feel all of their albums are worthy of praise. Certainly \\"Ok Computer\\" is deserving of more than just high praise, it was beyond brilliant. HOWEVER, this album turned me on to Radiohead and continues to be the most listened to in my collection. It is the one album that upu can always put in and enjoy, regardless of your mood. I feel that some of the other more conceptual Radiohead albums demand a certain mood and attention. This album is just fun, with several great tracks like \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" and \\"Prove Yourself.\\" Heck, every Radiohead fan is entitled to label one of their albums a favorite, regardles of which one it is, and this one is mine.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|I think it is a great set I like Karate Kid but having Karate Kid part 3 and the next Karate Kid on the same DVD is not a good idea because at least on mine Karate Kid part 3 works but the next Karate Kid does not work it works for about 5 minutes and then it goes fuzzy and does not get normal again
B000002G7G|5.0|This is the Velvet's best album in my opinion. I really like \\"Peel Slowly\\" but this is the one I always come back to. If you are new to Velvet Underground get this. Songs like \\"Candy Says\\" \\"What goes on\\" \\"Jesus\\" \\"The story of My Life\\" are so good and one of my favorite Velvet Underground songs of all time \\"After Hours\\". All of the other songs are very good as well. This album is Classic.
B0009IW88A|3.0|This is a soundtrack that sounds great in the movie but unfortunately doesnt hold up well when put into the context of a stand alone cd. I was also dissapointed with what two great composers like James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer came up with; there are really only two main themes, a cd with as many tracks as this one should include more variety, but i would recommend if you enjoy loud, percussion driven film scores.
B00005M08C|4.0|It's worth the money if you really enjoy the band and its work. <br />Aside from that Its just yet another cd to add to the collection.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|martin scorsese does it again in showing the importance of music.he first showed me about \\"the blues\\" and now he he pieces together footage of one of the most important figures of our time.most of this footage of bob dylan i had never seen before.it documents dylan's life up to his motorcycle crash in '66 and ends there.if you are looking for a documentary on his whole life this isn't it but it should in no other way disappoint.the reason scorsese put this out now is because we so very much need to look at dylan's work,especially from the early '60's,and take it to heart as it would do us all some good in this day and age.with the majority of today's music industry yapping about materialism and meaningless sex,we indeed need an artist to help those along in need in the path in the right direction.this documentary is proof and needs to be seen by all.
B0002VEX7S|4.0|As an LMT, I usually get stuck listening to music that could knock me out from boredom.  This, however, is a delightful album.  It is relaxing, but with \\"The Highway Man\\" and \\"Mummer's Dance\\" it is interesting as well.  I highly reccommend it.
0440237688|4.0|Who hasn't imagined living in a perfect world? I can attest to wishing for a perfect world where there is no war, no hate, and no hunger, a world of perfect happiness once upon a time. But, as is aptly shown in \\"The Giver\\", such a world comes with a price. You cannot have perfection and free will. They seem to cancel each other out in this world. The first time I read this book, I just read it. I think I was about twelve and I read it because it was something to do.  I didn't think about it, I just read it like one would read a newspaper ad, not thinking, just reading.  <br />However, it was only recently as part of a VHS assignment that I encountered The Giver one more and found myself intrigued by the images and concepts it held. I can't imagine a world without color, without music, without love. How can a world survive like that? How can the heart survive? A child with everything else can die without love. <br />The utter lack of freedom was also a disturbing image from this book. Every person must meet certain requirements or face being \\"Released\\". Perfection is expected and nothing else is tolerated for long. Children are assigned numbers, not names at birth, and each adult is assigned both a spouse, who they never intimate with, and a career, without choice. How can anything survive in this atmosphere of utter control? What happened to imagination and creativity? Where they too sacrificed with love and color for this perfect world? <br />This book was profoundly moving, and I am so glad that I was able to encounter it again as a young adult. My added years have given me insights, and experiences that I did not have at the tender age of twelve when I was first handed my copy of \\"The Giver\\". <br />-Jessica J. Smith <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hated Buffy. Sorry, I just did, and I hated Angel too. I'm not really sure what else to say. I thought they were slow, and more about the actors than the tv show its self.<br /><br />BUT. I *loved* Firefly. I'm serious.<br /><br />If you have ever seen any of the anime Cowboy Bebop, and liked it...you should at least give Firefly a try. There is a laugh in almost every episode, and you end up falling in love with the characters.<br /><br />It is a tragedy that Fox cancelled this show, but then networks are stupid, and NO ONE ever takes scifi/fantasy seriously.<br /><br />With the movie out (Serenity), now is the best time to watch some Firefly.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Super Stupid horror movie that has really only one good performance in the entire film and that belogs to Rachel Weisz, who really does do much for this crap heap while Keanu makes a fool out of himself and the rest of the actors make Keanu look like an proffestional actor.  <br /> <br />The one star goes to Rachel Weisz only. <br />
1401206905|4.0|If \\"Batman: Year One\\" had been called, more appropriately, \\"Commissioner Gordon: Year One,\\" I would have given this book five stars. Unfortuneately, the book is titled, and marketed as a Batman adventure, and while it is definately good, it falls short of greatness. <br />The biggest problem in my opinion is that the book is too short; it's titled \\"Year One\\" and takes place over the course of one year, but rushes through this time to the point of becoming shallow. The Batman is more a peripheral character, never going beyond a two-dimensional comic book protagonist. For being a book based on Bruce Wayne's emergence as Batman, we really don't understand his transformation and its causes. We are treated only to one glimpse of HOW he becomes the Dark Knight, but never get an explanation of his Bat-persona or his methods for fighting crime. In a book telling Batman's amateur days, I would have expected much more learning and discovery, both of his character and the tricks-of-the-trade of Batman's job. <br />Instead of Batman, Miller focuses almost double the time on Jim Gordon and his emergence in Gotham. I do not complain about learning more about Gordon; he is a great character and has always been a personal favorite of mine, but Miller really makes him interesting and human throughout the story. It's Gordon that makes \\"Year One\\" a worthwhile experience and a fantastic book. Miller should have dedicated this story to Jim Gordon and focused on a much more comprehensive tale of Batman's neophyte years.  <br />Finally, for some reason we also see the emergence of Catwoman. In a book that is only long enough to develop one of its main characters, this subplot ultimately distracted me. Selina's character cannot be nearly as developed as it needs to be; she pops in and out of story and really only takes panel space away from Batman and Gordon. <br />Overall this is a worthwhile experience; the story is still entertaining and affecting. I would recommend trying to find a cheaper version, though. The graphic novel and its accoutrements are less than special in this special edition. Mazzuchelli provides an entertainging, if not flat, little commentary on Batman's history, and Miller writes a strange, overly-heavy, imagery-laced account of his early experiences with Batman as a child. Neither of which qualify as special features. The edition also includes many of Mazzuchelli's pencillings, juxtaposed next to the paintings or finished pages. A neat idea, but the sparse commentary on these pages makes most of what we see a mystery.  <br />Even though I spent all my words criticizing this story, I still am happy I purchased this book. I guess that's what counts most.
B00003CX9E|4.0|When watching a film, the average viewer comes to expect a few things.  They expect a beginning, a middle, and an end.  They expect building drama and a climax.  In this film, they get both, only the film itself is the drama and climax--the beginning, middle, and end--and not the story.<br /><br />Orson Welles takes all of his talents in radio, theatre, and writing and tackles a new genre, the cinema.  In the process, he does things unheard of in contemporary techniques and stuns critics... well, a few of them.  Most of the critics and the general audience \\"didn't get it\\", so to speak.  That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully: a nice helping of controversy, both with the \\"outrageous\\" techniques and the, uh, political commentary.<br /><br />Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't.  Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now.  Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.<br /><br />Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect.  The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with \\"No Trespassing\\".  One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end.  It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal.  Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters...  and then what is the audience supposed to do with it?<br /><br />Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach.  This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated.  It's worthy of its place as a critically-acclaimed classic, and yet it's still debatable whether it is worth it.<br /><br />As for this DVD, it is an very good transfer and especially is required for the soundtrack.  For once we can finally hear why exactly she's a bad singer, we can hear his whispered death-word, and some more expressionist techniques are revealed.  Commentary tracks are interesting enough, I suppose, but the documentary is much more worth the time for seeing the importance of the movie without having anybody getting too nostalgic about the film proper.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBs the audience supposed to do with it? <br /> <br />Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach.

B000A6T1KE|5.0|Stop trashing this film it is great. I love the enterprise battle and the story is good. Also, as for a clone that looks like him, they are being realistic about it, the looks of a person are shaped by events not only by genetics. So, just leave this film alone.
B000002MTR|5.0|I bought this album when I was 13, I loved it from day one and listened to it several times every day. That's 10 years ago and my relationship with the album hasn't changed. The album has a totally unique carma and feel that I love. Dave Navarro widens the bands expression and makes it more sophisticated and gives it a more fluid sound. Many die hard RHCP-fans thinks One Hot Minute isn't a good album. I think the reason is that the album doesn't sound like RHCP - it sounds like One Hot Minute.
0887307280|5.0|As a business coach, I find this book exceptionally easy to read and the 'working examples' used are wonderfully effective.  The proposals and recommendations are simple, but the success of this book depends on the readers commitment to and willingness to apply them in a practical manner in their own businesses.  Well done - will recommend it to many of my clients and friends.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I am a huge Firefly fan, but you don't have to be to enjoy this movie.  The background is explained enough that people who aren't familiar with the series will understand what's going on, but not so much that if you are familiar with the series you get bored with it. <br /> <br />It's not a comedy, but there are funny moments.  Plenty of action for the action fans, but good plot for the story lovers. <br /> <br />You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to see it again
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is made up of three of Frank Miller's graphic novels, and one tiny short story at the beginning. <br /> <br />But the short story makes for a nice start into the film. <br /> <br />The visual effects are amazing, and when i went to see what the graphic novels were like, i found that the images and camera angles in the film were a spot-on duplicate of nearly every page of those novels - of course with little changes here and there. <br /> <br />Also amazing is the fact that it is as if each of the actors in the film were bron for their roles. They look almost surreally like the characters in the novels. Clive Owen is uncanny, Benicio Del Toro - albeit with a bit of make-eup and prsotethic - looks like the character in the book, Mickey Rourke - in my opinion - needed very little make-up to play Marv, as he's done a fairly good job of messing up his own face all by himself. But he truly steals the show as the daring, revenge-fuelled Marv. <br /> <br />All-in-all, the film is mesmerising. Three strange but brilliant stories based in a whore-run, crime-ridden city. A classic...
B0007GAERG|5.0|I am surprised by some of the negative reviews. This CD is amazing.  I never bought a Mariah CD before, just as I've never brought Christina or Whitney - Why when you can hear them on the radio for as long as your interest in the song lasts (6-12 weeks). HOWEVER, this CD Rocks! It has something for everyone ballads, R&B, pop, Rap, vocals, beats, collaborations -- and just an overall compilation of energy, talent, and listening pleasure. And come on... you can't resist the sing-along. I recommend this as a buy - it will come to be known as a classic.
1878424777|1.0|This guide to personal freedom achieves the \\"freedom\\" through what I call situational ethics. That may be unfair in that I couldn't bring myself to listen to the second disc because it ran so counter to my beliefs
B00006F7S4|5.0|<br />Beck has always been known for his ever-changing moods -- particularly since they often arrived one after another on one album, sometimes within one song -- yet the shift between the neon-glitz of Midnite Vultures and the lush, somber Sea Change is startling, and not just because it finds him in full-on singer/songwriter mode, abandoning all of the postmodern pranksterism of its predecessor.  <br /> <br />What's startling about Sea Change is how it brings everything that's run beneath the surface of Beck's music to the forefront, as if he's unafraid to not just reveal emotions, but to elliptically examine them in this wonderfully melancholy song cycle. If, on most albums prior to this, Beck's music was a sonic kaleidoscope -- each song shifting familiar and forgotten sounds into colorful, unpredictable combinations -- this discards genre-hopping in favor of focus, and the concentration pays off gloriously, resulting in not just his best album, but one of the greatest late-night, brokenhearted albums in pop. This, as many reviews and promotional interviews have noted, is indeed a breakup album, but it's not a bitter listen; it has a wearily beautiful sound, a comforting, consoling sadness. His words are often evocative, but not nearly as evocative as the music itself, which is rooted equally in country-rock (not alt-country), early-'70s singer/songwriterism, and Baroque British psychedelia. With producer Nigel Godrich, Beck has created a warm, enveloping sound, with his acoustic guitar supported by grand string arrangements straight out of Paul Buckmaster, eerie harmonies, and gentle keyboards among other subtler touches that give this record a richness that unveils more with each listen.  <br /> <br />Surely, some may bemoan the absence of the careening, freeform experimentalism of Odelay, but Beck's gifts as a songwriter, singer, and musician have never been as brilliant as they are here. As Sea Change is playing, it feels as if Beck singing to you alone, revealing painful, intimate secrets that mirror your own. It's a genuine masterpiece in an era with too damn few of them.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This was a quality concert. I think they may have played every song they ever recorded. It was like being there without having to put up with the crowd and the drive home.
B0000062S0|2.0|Walking Into Clarksdale. <br /> <br />First, before you proponents of this record yell at me. I get it. This isn't Zeppelin and should not be treated as such. <br /> <br />What I will drive home is there are so many things wrong with this record. <br /> <br />First, with two capable musicians and having such a storied history one would expect a effort with more \\"kick.\\" Other reviewers have said it and I concur - this record feels well - tired. There is no spunk, no energy and nothing that grabs you by your wrists and demands you listen. What you get it is a meandering mediocre (did I just say that?  - Yup) record that takes you nowhere. I'll go one step further if two unknowns had cut an album like this I doubt it would've even been released. <br /> <br />Second, the mix is total crap. I have no clue why Jimmy didn't produce. We know he's incredibly capable in this department. My only thought this is another \\"Plantism.\\" Which turned out to be the kiss of death. Take out the heart and soul leaving only a sterile midrangy recording with no ummphy bass and searing leads - its painful to listen to after awhile. <br /> <br />Third, the songwriting. We know these guys can write some great stuff. Where is it? Only a few tunes merit a passing interest. Best example of this is the hit \\"most high.\\"  Other than that, we're left with one listen wonders. Tunes you hear and go \\"My God, this is boring.\\" <br /> <br />Its not say this record is bad. Its just such a huge letdown. I don't know what the lads were going for. The mature rock audience? If so, they missed badly. They should've just been themselves. Bringing in Albini to produce - they don't need to cater to the Nirvana mallrats. Be themselves, set the trend don't try emulate something they think is hot.  <br /> <br />Bottom line here I view this record as a Plant solo record. You ask why? Its obvious to me Plant wore the pants here. He dictated the feel and much of the approach of this record. Jimmy left to his own deviceswould crank out something more akin to Coverdale/Page - the Guitar army in force. The Guitar army was left locked outside the studio on this one. <br /> <br />This is not an accessible record - even for moderately interested people. Heck being a fan of Zep I want to get into this - I try to get into it once a year. I've still been unable to. It simply doesn't connect on any level to me. <br /> <br />Don't buy this if just starting. This one is for diehards. <br /> <br />Makes you wonder if this was a case of sabotage (Plant has been accused of it before). Or a shining example that the magic of years past wasn't all Jimmy and Percy. They just got all the glory of it. <br /> <br />One could conclude either of those scenarios.
0895260131|1.0|Spencer tried hard to \\"prove\\" fact by quoting from the Koran. However, he fails to realize that one can similarly pick apart the Bible and very easily claim that Christinity preaches violence, discrimination against women, etc For example,  <br />Proverbs 22:14 - The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.   <br /> <br />When will people realize that religious texts were not meant to be picked apart and read literally. For most of religious history, stories in the Koran and Bible were merely passed on verbally and meant to be taken in as stories with a general theme. It's only since the invention of the printing press that we foolishly \\"study\\" every word and phrase without understanding it's context and then claim some sort of \\"evidence\\" that a particular text and the religion it comes from is bad.  <br /> <br />As for the claim that most terrorist are Muslim - it's flat out wrong. The greatest number of suicide attacks were inflicted by the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, not Muslims.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Another great Buddy Guy album. Good solos, his guitar tone is all there. some different styles. a must have for Buddy guy fans.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This was a spectacular film.  Not only for the FFVII fans, but for anyone who appreciates the beauty of a good CG/animated masterpiece.  The fight scenes were especially superb.  I just saw the Japanese version with English subtitles, and I can't wait to buy the US version when it's released here.  Too bad this wasn't in theaters over here.  This movie gets 10 out of 5 stars from me.
B00006EXL5|3.0|I heard about My Chemical Romance long before they reached MTV success.  But honestly, they didn't interest me enough to really care that much.  SO after Three Cheers came out I got it and decided to give this one another try.  After a few more listens I felt like the albums were very similiar yet different, so don't discard me if I make some comparisons here. <br /> <br />IBYMB is at heart a horror punk album.  Lot's of fast punk riffs and the like that goes along with the genre.  However, these guys pull a lot of songs out of the bucket where I think:  Wow if they changed that chord to this and that riff to that other one this song would be off the charts on MTV.  The only thing is, they don't do that, they keep the unchatchy guitar chords in place of the popier ones found on three cheers. <br />So does that mean this is a less catchy version of three cheers? <br />Not exactly. <br /> <br />First off, the drummer for this one was a bit different.  IMO he was a bit better than the current one, but whatever he's similiar.  The vocals are surprisingly same.  You can't tell the difference between Gerard's old voice and now, however Frank and Ray sound a lot different on this one.  I'd also say that the guitarwork here is a bit different.  Sounds a bit like a dirty AFI from long ago.  Which is not a bad thing.  ALso, it's a good idea to say that the production quality isn't exactly A+ but it's done by Eyeball, a record company that I respect more than others. <br /> <br />I really hate to say it, but there's a bunch of throway songs on here.  Sure, about 5 are good, but the rest are less than memorable.  It's almost like Gerard and the guitar are not on the same page at some points in here.  His voice does not always match the guitarwork.  This in turn creates a sound that makes the whole CD sound underthought.  I must admit, three cheers is better in almost every respect, except perhaps lyrics and vocals.   <br /> <br />That's about all I can say about this one.  I would say to get it only if you liked three Cheers A LOT. Other than that stay away unless you like dreary sounding horror punk. <br /> <br />
B000AM6OQ2|1.0|First off, this film is fantastic, read my other review. Just had to comment on this new dvd release. NOTHING NEW, different color case, provoking potential buyers to get this, that its an upgrade, not hardly. Execs. want a few more bucks in there pockets with the remake coming out soon. People, be original, leave classic films alone, I have never seen a remake that was better. They ever try to remake Jaws, I'll steal every film negative and burn them. Upgrade Jaws fine, like Star Wars, a little cgi for the phony shark scenes but that is it. The Fog is awesome, but the remake differs, I bet the music is different, obviously the story is, because someone is trapped under water in a car being chased by a ghost. So the teenage market probably has no idea there is a Carpenter version, rerelease the original, it stands the test of time. The new version was never even screened to reviewers untill after its release. That says alot, no confidence, hollywood moguls suck. Gee why not redo every Brady Bunch episode with new hip people, NOT. I balk at this dvd release. The film, 5 stars, this reissue 0.

B000AXSN5G|2.0|First and foremost, this was a disappointment. I was hoping for a recovery from the god-awful \\"Let's Roll\\" and equally unimpressive blues noodling  of \\"Greendale,\\" but the streak apparently continues.  <br />There is almost nothing memorable about these songs. The music is just backdrop, and for what? Some of the most stumblebum lyrics we've seen from one of the greatest musicians we've known. It's reminiscent of what you'd get from a bad high school poetry assignment.... yes, it rhymes, but where is the sharp lyricism and meter we took for granted on previous efforts? Or maybe it's just that he's set so high a standard for himself; really, when he's on top of things, he's got the world on a string. <br />\\"Prairie Wind\\" is being hailed as the third in the \\"Harvest\\" trilogy, but those stuck waving their palm fronds have already missed the true messiah that was \\"Silver and Gold.\\" Remember that one? The one with singable songs and music you wanted to learn?  <br />\\"Prairie Wind\\" has the same feel as the last Warren Zevon album, a rush job and, for the most part, a pity party paraded by the press. Granted, there were some fine songs on there, but his previous album, \\"Life'll Kill You,\\" was solid gold and almost completely overlooked. Folks are latching onto the aneurysm ordeal as a tale of integrity and strength and truth, as with imminent doom Young was true to the course and his roots, despite the situation. <br />\\"Prairie Wind\\" isn't without its moments. \\"This Old Guitar\\" is a tight tune about time and timelessness and how all we ever are are borrowers, and \\"When God Made Me\\" is fit to be sung in any church, more powerful than any hymn or \\"song of contemporary praise and worship\\" written in the last 30 years. <br />I'm glad I didn't buy the DVD set. If you really need a DVD of a classic Neil Young performance, get the \\"Silver and Gold\\" DVD. It's just Young and his guitars, harmonicas and pump organ, acoustic and real and beautiful. Or, if you just want some quality acoustic music, try Iron and Wine, or Sufjan Stevens... or you could just listen to Harvest again. <br /> <br />
1558908382|5.0|If you are a John Cusak fan, this is a must!  If you love 80's music or went to high school in the 80's, this movie will bring back so many memories.  Although there is a lot of violence in it, the humor helps to offset all the shooting so that you don't notice it as much.  There are some great lines in this movie and Dan Ackroyd is a riot!
B0000028W9|4.0|My feelings toward Lennie are many and mixed.  Since this album, I sometimes think of Lennie as \\"the old croaker,\\" an old raven croaking out dark forebodings of things to come, interspersed with ironic reminiscences about this mortal coil.  But I love his  croakings dearly anyway.  So what if he does take himself so dreadfully seriously, and has for so many years?  I still like him, and enjoy his grim tunes, and really loved this album.  This was a good introduction to Leonard Cohen.     I saw him perform these tunes on his promotional tour for the record (yes, I'm pretty old too) when I was rather new to his songs, or so I thought, and had seldom been more moved to learn then that the song my mother played when I was a small child, and that we sang in church camp around the fire, \\"Suzanne,\\" was his.      The following year, I was terribly amused to watch Don Henley play \\"Democracy is Coming to the USA\\" at Bill Clinton's inauguration.  Perhaps not all of us got the joke, but me and Lennie did perhaps.      And \\"Anthem\\" as the soundtrack for \\"Natural born Killers\\" prison riot scenes was an absolutely brilliant choice, lifting up the horror and tragedy of such imagery to a timeless portrait of man at his worst.  Perhaps this was most true to the spirit of \\"I've seen the future, baby.  It is murder.\\"      But Lennie hasn't seen the future, he has merely seen a lot.  I think the tune where he goes on about what the future will be like, well, predicting doom and gloom has always been a going concern, and always finds buyers (not really predicting.  It is sort of a morbid mood he is projecting.)  I can no longer take it so seriously after having the album for 10 years, and think when he \\"predicts\\" the \\"lousy little poets coming round, trying to sound like Charlie Manson,\\" his intent might have been the Beatles' \\"Helter Skelter,\\" or it might have been him with this song.      So if you got Weltschmertz, or however you spell it, Lennie's your man, he will hook you up.   Lennie definitely takes himself far too seriously, sometimes to the point of absurdity, but if you can indulge him in that, his meditations are dark and deep.  This is a favorite and has been for years.
B000002IMG|5.0|The fiery, jazzy lick and riffs of golden boy Alex Skolnick is worth the price of admission alone.  Sure this is a whole lot of borrowing from Metallica (Chuck Billy totally is aping Hetfield), Megadeth (the widdily, meandering riffs), and Anthrax (the midpaced stomp), but boy what a ripoff!  And I mean that in a great way!  This is a total embodiment of the Bay Area Thrash sound, just pop enough to be catchy, just brutal enough to make you wanna curbstomp your grandma.  The topnotch Aerosmith cover (\\"Nobody's Fault\\") is a keen bonus...anyone remember the vid on Headbanger's Ball?  While the boys from the Bay had many other great longplayers ahead of them, it wasn't until 1999's \\"The Gathering\\" that they would ever get back to the true unrelenting bonecrushing thrashgasm of \\"The New Order\\".
B000002868|2.0|While this album boasts some of Miles' alumni such as Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Miroslav Vitous and Airto Moreira it can't hold a candle to In A Silent Way, Bitches Brew or even Live-Evil. The pieces seem more like aimless sketches that are pleasent to listen to but ultimately go nowhere. It is a shame because of all of Shorter's albums with Miles and his solo albums before he joined Weather Report are hands down classics, after this he was just never the same. This was only the beginning of the end. After this, Weather Report descended into a bland jazz funk. For a more satisfying listen try any of Miles' 70's stuff or Wayne Shorter's Super Nova with a similar line up but far more adventurous sound.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|First of all, let me just say that the review entitled \\"I hate you people\\" is written by a person that simply doesn't quite know what he/she is or how to express their uniqueness in a way that isn't tired and boring.  Lamenting the belief that \\"Batman Begins\\" is another barrage of Hollywood CGI whereas Burton's \\"Batman\\" was not is not accurate at all.  This person needs to be reminded that Burton's \\"Batman\\" was a HUGE summer blockbuster popcorn flick for it's day (even more so than thte current movie) with Burton as the defacto \\"it\\" director of the time in Hollywood.  So, put the two movies side by side and they're very, very similar. <br /> <br />Aside from that, my personal view on this movie is that it is an excellent re-birth of the Batman series (hoping that more will follow, of course).  Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" was great for it's day and was just what us geeks were waiting for.  Keaton and Nicholson were fantastic in their roles of Batman and Joker, respectively.  In my opinion, no one will be able to match Jack as the Joker, but we'll see what may come for any future movies.  They can't just throw in Jim Carrey as another reviewer suggested.  They need an actor who can play a wickedly evil, yet perversely funny, villain and pull it off with flair.  Let's leave Carrey as The Riddler as that fit him much better.  It would be great to see, possibly, Mark Hamill in this role since he voiced the animated Joker so well. <br /> <br />I usually tire of origin stories, but this one was outstanding.  Following the same vein as \\"Spider-Man\\", Nolan shows us the very human, and very flawed, Bruce Wayne and his agonizing journey of self-realization after his parents' deaths.  I was drawn into the story and understood in a more vibrant way than ever before of why Bruce became the Batman.  His emergence of the hero we all know and love was great to see; from how he got many of his gadgets and the Batmobile, to how he and Alfred had to come up with sneaky ways to order the bitsand pieces of his costume. <br /> <br />With the exception of Katie Holmes, whom I personally don't care too much for, all of the other actors were great choices for their roles.  Morgan Freeman was excellent and should have had more screen time.  Gary Oldman portrayed Gordon in a very honest and caring way that made me appreciate him as an actor and Gordon as a character.  Michael Caine, of course, was absolutely fabulous and embraced Alfred as his own. <br /> <br />The one thing that initially concerned me before the movie came out was the new Batmobile.  I literally groaned, \\"Oh, no. Not that, please.\\"  But I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Where I once hated it, I now love it and it's perfect for this storyline.  If Bruce gets his gadgets from unused government contract prototypes, why not his car? <br /> <br />Bottom line . . .  <br /> <br />Blockbuster action flick?  Absolutely!  But one done very well with an excellent storyline and great actors. <br />Overloaded with CGI?  I don't see that at all.  Hardly any CGI that I remember. <br /> <br />My wife, who normally doesn't care for superhero/action type films, really liked this movie.
0060987464|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me a whole new outlook on Marilyn. His childhood was violent and depraved about which he talks quite frankly which must have been difficult to dredge up all his awful memories. I take my hat off the Marilyn for the honest and upfront account of his life. If a fan of Marilyn Manson, this is a must read.

B000A3DFZE|4.0|Having read the reviews, I have to say that I am disapponted in how much the reviewers are ripping Eric Clapton. If they are true fans, then they ought to realize that Clapton is probably the only artist not content to stay within one genre of music. He can move easily in and out of reggae, blues, R&B, and others. I think this album is a very strong album. It has some great tunes like \\"One Day\\", \\"Love Dont Love Nobody\\", and \\"Heaven\\". On \\"Revolution\\", Calpton has been able to duplicate Bob Marley and the Wailers (not an easy thing to do). So, when you listen to the album, please keep in mind that Clapton wants to show how happy he is in his life and that he is not content to be a one trick pony.
B000AL730O|5.0|I've been a lifelong Beatles fan, and Lennon/McCartney have long been my favorite songwriters/musicians. After listening to the new McCartney disc, I believe this is a definitive compilation of Sir Paul at his finest. On C&C, McCartney speaks straight to the listener's heart, in the most simplistic, yet brilliantly masterful way.  <br /> <br />Jenny Wren, a breezy, melodic tune, is reminiscent of the Beatles Blackbird, yet with a unique sound all its own. I love the upbeat feel to Promise To You Girl, especially as it changes beat mid-tempo. Paul tells a poignant story in How Kind Of You - again, totally relatable to those who have experienced a similar string of events in their lives. Friends To Go is a catchy, unforgettably melodic tune, extremely listenable. Rounding out the compellingly emotional side, is the heartfelt song, A Certain Softness. A beautiful song, rich, yet mellow in its simple presence.  <br /> <br />Blending the perfect balance on this album, Too Much Rain is another standout piece. Reminiscent of past hardships and heartbreak, and on the brink of melancholy, the mood recovers brilliantly, as McCartney reminds us to \\"laugh when your eyes are burning, smile when your heart is full of pain...\\".  <br /> <br />English Tea is absolutely Beatles-esque, which vividly depicts the languid feel of an English garden on a Sunday afternoon. One of my personal favorites is This Never Happened Before, with its relevant lyrics, very easy to relate to. A smooth love ballad, it's classic McCartney. Without oversentimentality, he's given us a heart full.  <br /> <br />If pressed to list any negative aspect to this latest McCartney effort, I'd say some of the songs were too short in length, running barely longer than two and a half minutes. Also, I'm not a fan of an excruciatingly slow build-up and intro, which some songs on this record seem to take direction.  <br /> <br />All in all however, I feel this album is an essential must-have for diehard fans and the casual listener alike. To sum it up, this album reinforces my own belief that McCartney is and will remain, my all-time favorite composer and musician. I love this album and can't say stress that enough! Here is a hauntingly poignant collection of songs, of which I'd say is McCartney's most polished and mature approach yet. Introspective and reflective, it draws you in from the get-go. With intricate melodies, yet simplistic in essence, for most everyone to relate to. And that to me, is a strong testament to McCartney's artistry. No doubt about it: after 40-plus years of legendary music, Sir Paul still shines.   <br /> <br />
B000002LBH|5.0|\\"Louder Than Bombs\\" is too amazing for words.  I can't believe some of these song were ever considered B-sides.  It plays like one of the greatest, \\"greatest hits\\" by any band.  It's extremely impressive how this supposed hodge-podge of tunes sounds so coherent and strong.  I highly recommend this album more than any SMITHS' record out there.  They're all worth owning, but \\"BOMBS\\" is packed with more SMITHS' classics than any other SMITHS' record.  Buy it without hesitation. <br /> <br />Stand-out tracks according to me:  IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?, SHEILA TAKE A BOW, SHOPLIFTERS OF THE WORLD UNITE, HALF A PERSON, PANIC, GIRL AFRAID, WILLIAM, IT WAS REALLY NOTHING, YOU JUST HAVEN'T EARNED IT YET, BABY, HEAVEN KNOWS I'M MISERABLE NOW, ASK, OSCILLATE WILDLY, THESE THINGS TAKE TIME, RUBBER RING, BACK TO THE OLD HOUSE, HAND IN GLOVE, STRETCH OUT AND WAIT, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LET ME GET WHAT I WANT, THIS NIGHT HAS OPENED MY EYES, and ASLEEP <br /> <br />That's 19 out of 24 tracks that, in my opinion, are classics.  And the one's I left out are argueably classics to other fans, I'm sure.  Even the album title is one of their best.  Only \\"Meat Is Murder\\" beats it out for the best SMITHS' album title.
B00003CXIY|5.0|I am a BIG fan of teen comedys...i own the American Pie movies and Harold and Kumar....Van Wilder....you know the usuall and this one is definitly one of the best, its got all the expected items you'd find in a teen comedy, nudity, crude humor, you know, but the ensamble is amzing together, and it just looked like they had a lot of fun making it, but it was made by pros, the guys who have been doing this kind of stupid humor since the '70s....i mean the Zuckers. they Rock. ok, if you have the cash and want a laugh, and like those kinds of movies, this one NEEDs to be in your collection.
B000AL730Y|5.0|This album is Paul McCartney's creative and musical masterpiece from his solo career.   It takes several full listening sessions of the album to fully realize that this is an outstanding work of musical, harmonic, and lyrical art.  The song that best represents the album is \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\", although nearly all the songs carry their own weight in a unique way.   Thanks to Paul for challenging himself to produce \\"Chaos & Creation.\\"
B000002J0N|5.0|This is my personal favourite CSN album. The musicians CSN  used before on other albums sound real good together, technically much more than allright; the album has been very good recorded; the songs have good lyrics (but maybe you've noticed already I'm not a native speaker, so maybe I should not be the judge of this); the balance between ballads and up-tempo songs is also very good. Like other albums from the seventees (this one is from 1977) the album is very easy to listen to. In some cases that will get boring, but that's certainly not the case with this album.     The song Cathedral on it's own is reason enough to buy this album. It's a critical quest for religion in Winchester cathedral almost logically turning into a dissapointment. The song starts of very quiet and than changes a few times from slow to fast. It's really good! But so are Sadow captain, Dark star, Anything at all. David Crosby is responsable for a lot of good stuff on the album. He's made made 2 of the songs I've mentioned and I forgot to mention the very beautiful song In my dreams. The point of this song and of Cathedral you won't get by listening to the beginning of the song. There's only one thing you can do about that...    OTHER CLASSICS:   CSN: Crosby, Stills and Nash  CSNY: Deja Vu and 4 way street  Listen closely to material from 1980 and later before you buy it: they've made some pretty boring albums.  The CSNY box is a pretty good alternatie, if you don't want to buy all the CSN/CN/solo-albums.  There also are some good duo- or solo-albums from the seventees.   Best new material comes from CPR!
B0000584V3|5.0|Not since my high school years, 93-97, had I been a fan of metal.  After talking to a fellow college classmate about Slayer, I decided to take him up on his suggestion to check out the band In Flames.  After purchasing Colony, and having the epiphany that there could possibly be great metal out there, despite the decline of The Headbanger's Ball, and the obvious failings of the so-called metal bands dominating the charts in the US, I decided to peruse the reviews on Amazon to see where this hopefully resurrected metal fan needed to search next.<br /><br />Everywhere I looked: Opeth.  To boot, I had never heard such words used to describe a metal band: eloquent, majestic, beautiful, exquisite, touching, emotional, poignant, epic, delicate...ok, I must stop here because the references to positive transendence, though absolutely fitting, might give you the idea that this is not a heavy metal band at all.<br /><br />And perhaps that is true.  If there is a band in the metal genre which perfectly symbolizes the evolutionary certainty of all quality music bending the limits of genre, then Opeth is it.<br /><br />No band has ever captivated my imagination and love for music the way this band has, and Blackwater Park is the album that started it all.<br /><br />The escalating, soft tension of the opener, \\"The Leper Affinity\\" exploded into the most demonic of riffs.  Not because the riff is pure evil, but because the melody, so seductive and oddly soothing, epitomizes true darkness as it is compelling in the true nature of sin.  This band surpasses musical genius by honing the exact ebb and flow of extreme human emotions.<br /><br />Throughout this 67 minute, 8-track opus, Opeth guide the listener through a world of vivid lament, psychosis, rage, reconcilliation, victory, and defeat.  I do not know of any album (and my collection of pop/rock/hip-hop/jazz/jamband/soul/etc. reaches near the 2,000 mark) that ends so fittingly as this one, when Mikael exclaims, \\"The sun sets forever, over, Blackwater Paaaaarrrrrrrkkkkkkk!\\" at the album's closing.  At this zenith, the listener truly feels the inescapable suffocation of death, and the unfathomable possiblities of an afterlife.  I dare any reviewer to name a band which can conjure such emotions.<br /><br />What's for sure is that Opeth accomplishes such seemingly impossible feats by coupling patient songwriting with flawless instrumental execution.  Guitar players who instantly become enthralled with the idea of replicating the tasty guitar passages, pause for just a second.  The tracks on this album are so layered, that if you wanted to produce the exact same sound live, you'd need a band to rival the numbers of your local city's orchestra.<br /><br />It is this thoughtfulness in composition that truly separates this band from others, and allows this album to rest upon the apex of metal along with its ancestor, Still Life (to this day I cannot decide which of the two reigns supreme).  Every moment of this album, the extreme death/black/progressive elements and the folkish/melancholic-acoustic-doom progressions, accentuates the duality of darkness, in its most dormant and aggressive manifestations.<br /><br />Together, these polar opposites collide to produce a musical experience unmatched by any in the metal field.  Aside from pulling this fan from his metal grave, Blackwater Park ensures that this decade will not fail the world of music in producing an incomparable contribution to extreme/heavy music.n sets forever, over, Blackwater Paaaaarrrrrrrkkkkkkk!\\" at the album's closing.

B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie gets it right on all levels.Though I've never read the comics by frank miller,I think now's good time to catch up.Visually impressive,editing is top-notch,acting I would give 100 on any scale.Just Mickey Rourkes' part alone deserves at least a 'GOLDEN GLOBE' nomination.Make sure you have plenty of popcorn around for this one people!
B00003XAVA|4.0|Wind on the water is an album with 5 or 6 very good songs, but somewhere in the middle the album has some less interesting songs on it. Songs like Mama Lion, Bittersweet, Homeward Through The Haze en definitely To The Last Whale... are that good that it diserves the fourth star.   The duo-albums within the CSNY-colaboration are often better than the ones they've made with the three/four of them in a later stage.   In conclusion: a good band, a lot of good songs, but also some things that are less interesting. Being a fan of CSN, and not owning Wind On The Water would be a bit strange, but when you own the box with the best of CSN(Y), you can do without it, for the best songs of the album you can find there to.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is funny for two reasons,subtle-stupidity.The movie feels like you're living in the early 80's again when being a 'nerd' was not the thing to be(that's until 'REVENGE OF THE NERDS'came out).Highwater pants,thick coke bottle glasses,being picked on by the whole varsity football team,mushmouth dialogue and waiting darn near the end of the movie to get the girl of yourdreams.What more can you ask for?!
B000002J0P|5.0|For the CSN-virgins among us: this is the classic CSN album. It has everything Crosby, Stills and Nash stand for: great singing, great songs, a lot of acoustic guitars, ballads and heavier stuff etc. Nowadays the album's still good. When you're intersted in CSN, and you don't know what album you should buy: choose between this album and CSN (with Shadow Captain, Cathedral etc.). This is the classic one, with the sound of the sixties, the album CSN is a typical album from 70's: very good band, very good recorded, very mature pop-music.  <br />You want Neil Young to be part of it? Two albums are important: Deja Vu and 4 Way Street (live). I personally believe you should by all four the albums I mentioned. But (the album) Crosby, Stills and Nash is a good start. <br /> <br />By the way, CSN have made some bad albums in their later years, sometimes together with Neil Young. Best new work? Try CPR (with David Crosby).
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and christrian bale has become of my favorite actors after seeing BATMAN BEGINS.Totally different from the very first one in that it was a lot more visual as far as atmosphere,which is classic for gotham city,which is known for it's dark and merky settings (if you've read as many comic books as I have).Pure entertainment!
0966638328|5.0|I have a part-time avocation as a graphic designer, having spent many years as a public relations/communications director.  One of the elements that always made my print pieces stand out was the use of colour, and I learned how to use colour from Pantone.<br /><br />This is a good guide for understanding colour and its uses for print and visual media.  It discusses how the different colours interact, as well as what mixtures produce different kinds of depths and hues in the colour itself.  There is a section that addresses the kinds of emotional responses people give to colours - why, for example, McDonalds had for a time such a predominance of the colour red in their stores, or why certain colours of cars are more or less likely to stand out among the others.  Even subtle uses of colour are addressed - why does a teacher grading with a red pen become known as being more critical than the teacher doing the same commentary and correction with a green pen?  But not all of these are obvious.  For example, black in print and colour media often symbolises power, sophistication, style and elegance (think tuxedos) instead of more traditional 'dark' ideas.  The guide states that 'In recent years, attitudes about black have changed more than any other colour with positive associations outweighing the negative.'<br /><br />This book also gives some fascinating insights into the future of colour.  Particularly where print media and personal photography is concerned, the use of colour has never been more possible.  Illuminated manuscripts of old, which used to be the only full-colour texts, now have the modern full-colour-process productions as competition for grandeur; the typical Sunday comic pages has more colour that the typical production of almost any sort for centuries.<br /><br />The graphic layout of this book is interesting and thoughtfully done, and, as one can expect, done in glorious colour.  The layouts are artistically creative, giving literally hundreds of examples of use of colour in different ways.<br /><br />This is a good guide, and a fun book.s of examples of use of colour in different ways.   <br /> <br />This is a good guide, and a fun book.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|There are some downright beautiful songs on this CD. The band Robert Plant has put together to back him (Strange Sensation) are clearly a more talented group than he has surrounded himself with in awhile.  The songs are dreamy. Very evocative of some of the \\"trippier\\" music of the '70s.  (Sorry...\\"trippier\\" is a really bad word, but the only one that comes to mind.) <br /> <br />Favorites of mine include ANOTHER TRIBE (the opening track, which starts things off with a great drumbeat...not everyday the drums carry the melody).  TIN PAN VALLEY has it's moments that really rock.  But what's great about some of these tracks is the reflective mood that Plant is in.  He ruminates about aging, and finding new love at a late age (and learning to appreciate \\"the beauty within\\"), and about being a celebrity past his prime and the soul-killing choices of resting on your laurels.  There are also some political messages to be found, but they are somewhat general,and you can overlook them if you care to...which I do.  I have a hard time with foreign singers commenting on our domestic affairs.   <br /> <br />Robert Plant isn't capable of some of the soaring vocal work of his Zep years...hardly his fault...it's gonna happen with age.  But what he's really done is put what voice he does have to excellent use.  It's lower, mostly, but he manipulates it for maximum emotional and tonal effect.  And he's easier to understand than on any prior work. You can actually understand whole sentences the first time you listen...not something Zepellin or earlier Plant could boast. <br /> <br />The album doesn't really ROCK LOUD very much...so don't look for that.  But it is highly evocative, delicately played and a fantastic mood piece.  Great with headphones, or in a candle-lit room.  This is probably as close to \\"new Led Zep\\" as we'll ever get.   <br /> <br />It's nice to see that after all these years, after so many of his \\"peers\\" have hit the casino circuit and stopped releasing new work...Plant comes out with his best solo effort in ages...maybe ever. <br /> <br />If you're a fan, this is a MUST OWN!
